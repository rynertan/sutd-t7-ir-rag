## Description
Chrominance Signal Circuit in Color Television ReceiverBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a chrominance signal circuit in a color television receiver. More specifically, the present invention relates to a chrominance signal circuit in a PAL system color television receiver7 wherein a subcarrier is quadrature modulated by two color signals and one of the modulation axes is 1800 reversed for every second line and the phase of a burst signal is swung in syschronism with the reversion of the one modulation axis.Description of the Prior Art Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing one example of a chrominance signal circuit in a conventional PAL system color television receiver which constitutes the background of the invention. Referring to Fig. 1, a PAL system color television signal is applied to an input terminal 1. ThePAL system color television signal comprises a subcarrier suppressed chrominance signal wherein a subcarrier is quadrature modulated by two color signals and one of the modulation axis is 1800 reversed for every second line and a busrt signal the phase of which is swung in synchronism with the reversion of the one modulation axis. The color television signal applied to the input terminal 1 is amplified at a predetermined band width by means of a bandpass amplifier 2.The signal amplified by the bandpass amplifier 2 is applied to a one line delay line 3, an adder 4 and a subtractor 5.The signal as one line deiayed by the one line delay line 3 is applied to another input of each of the adder 4 and the subtractor 5. The adder 4 makes addition of these two input signals to provide a B Y singal and the subtractor 5 makes subtraction of these two signals to provide an R Y signal.The B Y signal is applied to a B Y demodulator 6 and the RY signal is applied to an R Y demodulator 7, respectively. On the other hand, only a burst signal is extracted from the output signal of the bandpass amplifier 2 by means of a busrt gate 10 which is driven responsive to a horizontal pulse P1. The burst signal thus extracted is applied to a phase detector 12 included in an identification circuit 11.Another input of the phase detector 12 is connected to receive a subcarrier which is fed back from a subcarrier oscillator 13. The output of the phase detector 12 is integrated by means of an integration means, not shown, and is applied to control the oscillation phase of the subcarrier oscillator 13. The detected output of the phase detector 12 is directly applied to an amplifier 18, which comprises a resonance circuit the resonance frequency of which is selected to be a 1 2 horizontal frequency. Accordingly, a sine waveS having the frequency commensurate with the 1 2 horizontal frequency is obtained from the amplifier 18, which sine wave is applied to a flip flop 19. A driving input of the flip flop 19 is connected to receive a horizontal pulse P1 the phase of which is slightly delayed as compared with that of the above described horizontal pulse P1. The subcarrier obtained from the subcarrier oscillator 13 is applied through a 1800 phase shifter 14 to the B Y demodulator 7 as a synchronization input. Similarly, the subcarrier obtained from the subcarrier oscillator 13 is applied through a 900 phase shifter 15 and a 900 phase shifter 16 to contacts 17a and 17b of a PAL switch 17, respectively. The PAL switch 17 is connnected to receive the output of the above described flip flop 19, so that the same is controllably switchable responsive to the pulse P2 of the 1 2 horizontal frequency. Accordingly, the PAL switch 17 alternately provides a subcarrier as 900 phase shifted and the subcarrier as 900 phase shifted for each line to the R Y demodulator 7 as a synchronization signal. Without the identification circuit 11, the switching operation by the PAL switch 17 could be initiated at an intial condition as arbitrarily determined. In such a situation, it could happen that the modulation axis of the chrominance signal applied to the R Y demodulator 7 and the subcarrier which represents the demodulation axis applied to the PAL switch 17 are exactly the same phase or the reversed phase. Accordingly, depending on an initial condition of the PAL switch 17, it could happen that the polarity of the demodulated output of the R Y demodulator 7 is improper for the succeeding circuit components, in which case a hue of an image as reproduced on a television screen could be considerably disturbed. The identification circuit 11 as shown in Fig. 1 is provided to prevent such an inconvenience. Such an identification circuit is described in German Patents Nos.1,240,919 and 1,248,708 and the couterpart British PatentNo. 1,138,911, for example. Accordingly, a description of the detail of a configuration and operation of the circuit is omitted. The conventional chrominance signal circuit as shown inFig. 1 involves a problem to be solved as to be described in the following. More specifically, the identification circuit 11 shown in Fig. 1 is structured such that phase detection is made with respect to the burst signal as extracted and the subcarrier, whereupon a sine wave of a 1 2 horizontal frequency is provided, which is applied to the flip flop 19 to trigger the same. Accordingly, on the occasion of reception of a weak electric wave, for example, it could happen that a burst signal disappears as a function of a noise ocurring at the burst signal period, a pseudo signal is inputted by virtue of a noise having the same frequency as the burst signal frequency, and the like, whereby the output of the phase detector 12 could be disturbed and as a result the sine wave signal S obtained from the amplifier 18 could be disturbed.Therefore, a triggering phase of the flip flop 19 could be accrodingly disturbed, with the result that the phase of the 1 2 horizontal frequency pulse P2 could be accordingly disturbed. Thus, provision of such a conventional identification circuit can not completely solve a problem of a lateral noise component of different hues on a television screen.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly described, the present invention is characterized in that the burst signal is phase shifted by a predetermined phase for every second line, the burst signal thus phase shifted for every second line is subjected to phase detection with respect to the subcarrier, the phase detected output is applied to an integration circuit having a predetermined time constant, and the output of the integration circuit is applied to control a state change of a two state circuit for controlling the reversion of the subcarrier. Preferably, the time constant of the integration circuit is selected to be longer than at least two line period. According to the present invention since a state change of the two state circuit is controlled responsive to the output of the above described integration circuit, a characteristic with respect to an incoming noise and the like is considerably improved and as a result a problem of a lateral line noise of different hues which occurred on a television screen of a conventional television receiver on the occasion of reception of a weak elecric wave, in particular, is advantageously eliminated. Furthermore, since the burst signal of all lines are utilized to control a state change of the twostate circuit, an information quantity is increased and accordingly the operation becomes stabilized. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the burst signal is phase reversed for every second line, whereupon the phase detection thereof is made with respect to the subcarrier. The two state circuit may comprise a bistable circuit or a flip flop and a direct current voltage obtained from the integration circuit is applied to control a state change of the flip flop. In a given example, the above described direct current voltage obtained from the integration circuit is applied to prevent a horizontal pulse input from being applied to the flip flop as a driving input. In another example, the above described direct current voltage obtained from the integration circuit is applied to disable a one side circuit portion of the flip flop. Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to provide an improved chrominance signal circuit in a color television receiver, which comprises an identification circuit of an extermely stablized operation for eliminating an influence caused by disturbance of a burst signal. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing an example of a chrominance signal circuit in a conventional PAL color television receiver which constitutes the background of the invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of the present invention Figs. 3A and 3B are graphs for explaining the operation of the Fig. 2 embodiment Fig. 4 is a graph for explaining a stabilized operation of the Fig. 2 embodiment and Fig. 5A and 5B are graphs depicting the operation of another embodiment of the present invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 2 , it is first pointed out that an identification circuit 20 of the Fig. 2 embodiment is different from the identification circuit 11 of the Fig.1 conventional circuit. More specifically, the identification circuit 20 comprises a switch means 21, which constitutes one of the essential features of the present invention. The switch means 21 is, as in case of the PAL switch 17, switch controllable responsive to the pulse P2 of a 1 2 horizontal frequency obtained from a flip flop 27. The switch means 21 includes two switch contacts 21a and 21b. The contact 21a is connected to receive a burst signal extracted by the burst gate 10. The contact 21b of the switch means 21 is connected to receive an output of a 1800 phase shifter 22, which is connected to receive a burst signal extracted by burst gate 10. Accordingly, the switch means 21 serves to provide the burst signal as 1800 reversed for every second line to a phase detector 23.Another input of the phase detector 23 is connected to receive the output of a 900 phase shifter 24 for phase shifting by 900 the subcarrier obtained from the subcarrier oscillator 13. The phase detector 23 is adapted such that when the phase difference of both signals is 90 the output thereof becomes zero volt, while the pull in ranges thereof is 4,433619 MHz 500Hz, for example. The output of the phase detector 23 is applied to an integration circuit 25. The time constant of the integration circuit 25 is selected to be approximately 10 lines. A direct current voltage obtained from the integration circuit 25 is applied to a base electrode of a switching transistor 26.An emitter electrode of the switching transistor 26 is connected to the ground and a collector electrode of the switching transistor 26 is connected through a series connection of a capacitor and a resistor to a drive input terminal of a flip flop 27. The junction of the above described resistor and the capacitor is connected to receive a horizontal pulse P1 through another series connection of a resistor and a capacitor. The output of the flip flop 27 is withdrawn as a 1 2 horizontal frequency pulse P2 for switch controlling the PAL switch 17 and the switch means 21. Now an operation of the embodiment shown will be described in the following. Fig. 3A shows waveforms of the signals at various portions in the embodiment ocurring over arbitrary five lines from n line to n 4 line. Referring to Fig. 3A, A shows in a vector fashion a subcarrier suppression modulated chrominance signal and a burst signal included in a color television signal applied to the input terminal 1. The burst gate 10 serves to extract only the burst signal from such television signal. Accordingly, the burst signal as extracted from the burst gate 10 is swung, i. e. the phase of the burst signal is changed, in association with the reversion of one modulation axis in the quadrature modulation, as shown as B in Fig. 3A.The switch means 21 serves to reverse the phase of the burst signal for every second line responsive to the 1 2 horizontal frequency pulse P2 as shown as C in Fig. 3A. Thus, the outupt of the switch means 21 is obtained as shown as D in Fig. 3A. E in Fig. 3A shows the phase of the output of the subcarrier oscillator 13. As seen from E in Fig. 3A, the subcarrier is of the leftward phase, i.e. the phase position commensurate with that of B Y . Such subcarrier is phase shifted by the 900 phase shifter 24, thereby to provide the signal as shown as F inFig. 3A. The phase detector 23 serves to compare the phases of the burst signal as shown as D in Fig. 3A and the subcarrier as 90 phase shifted as shown as F in Fig. 3A. Then the output of the phase detector 23 becomes of a negative polarity.Accordingly, the output of the integration circuit 25 for storing or integrating the above described negative polarity output is obtained as a negative constant direct current voltage as shown as G in Fig. 3A. In case where the 1 2 horizontal frequency pulse obtained from the flip flop 27 is of a reversed situation as shown asC in Fig. 3B, as compared with C shown in Fig. 3A, the burst signal obtained from the switch means 21 becomes as shown asD in Fig. 3B. Accordingly, the output of the phase detector 23 becomes positive and the output of the integration circuit 25 is obtained in a positive constant direct current voltage as shown as D in Fig. 3B. Now let it be assumed that a state change operation of the flip flop 27 ocurring when the burst signal as shown asD in Fig. 3A is obtained from the switch means 21 performs a normal operation of the chrominance signal circuit. Then, the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 on the occasion of the normal operation is a negative constant direct current voltage as shown as D in Fig. 3A. Accordingly, the switching transistor 26 remains cut off and the horizontal pulse P1 is kept applied to the flip flop 27 as a triggering input. Now consider a case where a burst signal as shown as D in Fig. 3A is missing consecutively for two lines for some reason. Then during the above described two line period when the burst signal is missing, the output of the phase detector 23 becomes zero volt. Therefore, the integrated voltage or the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 slightly increases for the above described two line period as shown as G in Fig. 4 and the absolute value thereof accordingly decreases. However, since the time constant of the integration circuit 25 has been selected to be approximately ten lines, as described previously, the flip flop 27 is properly kept supplied with the horizontal pulse P1 , even if the burst signal is missing for such two or three lines7 with the result that no malfunction is caused in the chrominance signal circuit. The same also applies in case where a pseudo burst signal is superposed. More specifically, even if the output of the phase detector 23 changes in the positive going direction as different from the normal operation, for say two to three lines, by virtue of a psuedo burst signal, the integrated output of the integration circuit 25 still maintains the negative voltage. Therefore, the switching transistor 26 is kept cut off. Accordingly, even in such a situation, the horizontal pulse P1 is effectively kept applied to the flip flop 27 as a drive input. Now let it be assumed that the flip flop 27 improperly operates for some reason and the 1 2 horizontal frequency pulse P2 as shown as C in Fig. 3B is obtained. Then, the burst signal as shown as D in Fig. 3B is obtained from the switch means 21 and therefore the output of the integration circuit 25 becomes as shown as G in Fig. 3B. Then the switching transistor 26 is rendered conductive. Accordingly, the horizontal pulse applied to the collector electrode of the switching transistor 26 is caused to flow through the transistor 26 now in conduction to the ground, with the result that the horizontal pulse is not applied to the flipflop 27 as a drive input. Therefore, the flip flop 27 maintains the state at that time, without causing a state change. Therefore, in such a situation, the switch means 21 is kept switched to either of the contacts 21a and 21b.Assuming that the switching means 21 is kept switched to the contact 21a, then the burst signal as shown as B in Fig. 3A is obtained from the switch means 21. Accordingly, the output of the phase detector 23 repeats an alternate change among the negative going direction and the positive going direction for each line, while the magnitude remains the same. Accordingly, the integrated voltage or the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 becomes zero volt.Therefore, the switching transistor 26 is again rendered non conductive, so that the horizontal pulse P1 is again applied to the flip flop 27 as a drive input. Therefore, the flip flop 27 again repeats a normal state change operation. Now let it be assumed that a state change of the flipflop 27 is stopped and the switch means 21 is kept switched to the contact 21b responsive to the output of the flip flop 27. Then the operation directly opposite to the foregoing description applies, with the result that the output of the integration circuit 25 becomes zero volt. Therefore, the flip flop 27 can again repeat a normal state change operation. The above described embodiment is structured such that the output of the subcarrier oscillator 13 is applied through the 900 phase shifter 24 to the phase detector 23. However, alternatively, the output of the subcarrier oscillator 13 may be applied through a 90 phase shifter to the phase detector 23. In such a case, conversely to the foregoing description, the output of the integration circuit 25 becomes a positive constant direct current voltage on the occasion of a normal operation and becomes a negative voltage on the occasion of malfunction. Accordingly, the circuit should be structured such that the polarity of switching transistor 26 is selected such that a state change operation of the flipflop 27 is stopped when the output of the voltage of the integration circuit 25 becomes negative. The above described embodiment is structured such that the burst signal is applied through a 1800 phase shifter to the contact of the switch means 21. However, the numerical value 1800 should not be construed by way of limitation.Alternatively, the phase shifter 22 may structured as a 90 phase shifter. In such a case, as shown in Fig. 5A, the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 becomes a negative constant direct current voltage on the occasion of the normal operation. Conversely, on the occasion of malfunction, the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 becomes zero volt, as shown in Fig. 5B. Accordingly, in such a case the circuit is structured such that the properly selecting the polarity of the switching transistor when the horizontal pulse P1 may not be applied to the flip flop 27 then the output voltage of the integration circuit 25 being applied to the base electrode of the switching transistor 26 is zero volt.In other words, in order to phase shift the extracted burst signal for every second line, it is not necessarily required to make 1800 phase shift, i.e. reversion, that a phase shift amount may be selected to cause an appreciable difference in the output voltage of the integration circut 25 between the occasion of the normal operation and the occasion of malfunction. The above described embodiment was structured such that on the occasion of malfunction the horizontal pulse P1 is prevented from being applied to the flip flop 27 as a drive input, whereby a state change of the flip flop 27 is controlled. However, a modification to be described in the following may be considered. More specifically, the base electrode of any one of the transistors 27a and 27b included in the flipflop 27 may be grounded when the voltage of the integration circuit 25 becomes a polarity different from that of the normal operation. Then, a circuit of one transitor in the flip flop 27 is disabled and as a result a state change of the flip flop is controlled. Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.
