## Description
This invention relates to novel chemical compounds and to their preparation, and more particularly to organic compounds of 7,7,8,8 tetracyanoquinodimethane hereafter referred to simply as TCNQ and method for the preparation of such compounds. Recently integrated circuit technologies have been remarkably progressed in electronics field, and very large scale integrated circuits VLSI are realized. However, the present technology for miniaturizing the integrated circuit is near the limit, and different approaches are required. For this purpose, various reserches of molecular electronics are pursued here and there. Under the circumstances, the inventors though that it was necessary to obtain an organic compound which has electric conductivity substantially equal to metals and is easy to arrange the molecules of the compound regularly in molecular unit. However, there are no organic compounds to meet the above characteristics heretofore. Organic compounds, the conductivity of which are substantially equal to metals, are known such as a complex compound of TCNQ and tetrathiofulvalene hereafter referred to as TTF . The complex compound is expressed by the following formura TCNQ and TTF form a charge transfer complex because TCNQ is a strong electron acceptor and TTF is an electron donor. The complex has electric conductivity the maximum value of which is comparable with the electric conductivity of mercury. However, the complex of TTF and TCNQ has not been succeeded in proccessing or manufacturing in molecular unit. Langmuir Blodgett s technique is generally known in the art as a technique for arranging molecules in monomolecular layer. However, generally known TCNQ derivatives cannot be processed in monomolecular layer or film by the Langmuir Blodgett s technique. Meanwhile, many studies have been directed to synthesize TCNQ derivatives. US. Pat. No. 3,558,671 discloses a method for synthesizing TCNQ fluoride and cyano TCNQ, in which quaternary ammonium salt is synthesized for use as dyestuff or pigment. U.S. Pat. No. 3,739,008 discloses a different method for synthesizing TCNQ fluoride and cyano TCNQ for use as dyestuff or antistatic agent. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,987, a method for synthesizing dialkoxyl TCNQ up to 8 carbons is disclosed. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,526,497, a method for synthesizing dialkonyl TCNQ and dialkoxyl TCNQ fluoride, where carbon number of alkyl is equal to or below 13, is described. U.S. Pat No. 3,115,506 discloses a synthesizing method of TCNQ having alkyl group up to 8 carbons from alkyl substituted 1,4 cyclohexane dione. A method for synthesizing TCNQ having alkyl group up to 3 carbons is discussed in Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 28, p. 2719, 1963, in which methylpara dimethoxybenzene obtained from 2 methylhydroquinone is reduced. However, these synthesizing methods are unsuitable for a novel TCNQ product having higher alkyl group, because of small yield. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel organic compounds which have an electrical conductivity comparable with metals, and are capable of arranging the molecules thereof regularly in molecular unit. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel organic compounds which are able to form monomolecular layer by Langmuir Blodgett s technique. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of synthesizing the novel organic compounds mentioned above. The above objects can be achieved according to the invention by organic compounds which comprise TCNQ having higher alkyl group. The compound are generally represented by the following formura The compounds are synthesized by the steps of deriving higher alkyl substituted cyclohexane dione by hydrogenating higher alkyl substituted hydroquinone, reacting the higher alkyl substituted cyclohexane dione with malononitrile, and oxidizing the reacted material. TCNQ is generary represented by the formula When TCNQ having higher alkyl group is dissolved in a solvent such as chloroform or benzen, the solution or mixture with higher fatty acid such as arachic acid may be formed as a monomolecular layer or film on the surface of the water when dropped thereon. By the action of the higher alkyl group, TCNQ having higher alkyl group is able to be formed as a monomoleclar layer between the surface of the organic solution and the surface of the water, and therefore monomolecular film or built up film can be manufactured on a sabstrate by Langmuir Blodgett s technique. The thus obtained monomolecular film or built up film of TCNQ derivative forms a charge transfer complex compound with an electron donor such as TTF. The charge transfer complex compound is applicable for making various electronic devices. TCNQ having higher alkyl group is synthesized by the following steps. The present invention will be practically explained by way of the following examples. Twelve grams of 2 pentadecyl hydroquinone was dissolved in 100ml of methanol. Then, the solution was hydrogenated in hydrogen atmosphere of initial pressure of 130kg cm² with Raney nickel as a catalyst at 170 C of reaction temperature. After cooling, the catalyst was removed and the solvent was volatilized to prepare a crystal of 2 pentadecyl 1,4 cyclohexam diol. Then 8.7g of the prepared crystal was dissolved in 200ml of methylene chrolide with 26.6g 0.001M of complex of pyridinium chlorochromate and almina, and stirred for 2 hours in ice cooling. After filtration of oxidizing agent and volatilization of the solvent, 5.6g of 2 pentadecyl 1,4 cyclohexane dione, which was white scalelike crystal, was obtained by purifying through silica gel column chromatography. The thus obtained compound had a melting point of 87 C and an infrared absorption band of 1710cm ¹ which corresponds to carbonyl group. The processes b and c of Example 1 were repeated using the obtained 2 pentadecyl 1,4 cyclohexane dion as a starting material, whereby 1,4 bis dicyanomethylene 2 pentadecyl cyclohexane which had a melting point of 98 C and 2 pentadecyl 7,7,8,8 tetracyanoquinodimethane were obtained. The yield of the 1,4 bis dicyanomethylene 2 pentadecyl cyclohexane and 2 pentadecyl 7,7,8,8 tetracyanoquinodimethane were 72 and 46.2 respectively. The thus obtained TCNQ having pentadecyl had a melting point of 120.5 C and an infrared absorption band of 2250cm ¹ which corresponds to cyano group. The processes of Example 2 were repeated except that 2 octadecyl hydroquinone was used instead of 2 pentadecyl hydroquinone. The resultant materials of each reaction were as follows The thus obtained TCNQ having octadecyl had a melting point of 125.5 C and an infrared absorption band of 2250cm ¹ which corresponds to cyano group. TCNQ having higher alkyl synthesized by methods such as those described above is able to be formed in monomolecular layer or film by Langmuir Blodgett s technique. Now, an example will be explained. TCNQ having dodecyl obtained by Example 1 was dissolved in chloroform to make a solution of molarity of 10 ⁴M. In this case, TCNQ was used singly or in dilute solution with higher fatty acid such as arachic acid. When the solution was dropped on a surface of an aqueous solution of pH5.5 in which 4 x 10 ⁴ mol of cadmium chloride and 5 x 10 ⁴ mol of potassium hydrogencarbonate were dissolved, TCNQ having dodecyl was spread on the surface of the aqueous solution to make good monomolecular layer or film. The monomolecular layer or film may form a built up film by piling one after another. As described above, TCNQ having higher alkyl may be formed into a Langmuir Blodgett s membrane. Therefore, it is possible to make a complex compound of TCNQ having higher alkyl and an electron donor such as TTF, heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salt, cyanine dye, etc. as a very thin film having conductivity comparable with metals. The very thin film is useful for various devices in molecular electronics field, such as organic semiconductor devices, light memory devices, photo electric devices and so on. For example, N butylpyridinium TCNQ n complex shows resistivity temperature characteristics in which the resistivity abruptly varies near 100 C. Therefore, the complex may be applicable to a temperature detector which is to be integrated in very large scale.
