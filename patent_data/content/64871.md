A dental handpiece in which a tool holder 30 is driven in oscillatory fashion by a drive shaft 20 at right angles to the holder, via a drive pin 26 engaging in an axial slot 40 in the holder, the slot being formed in a convex surface of the holder so as to maintain the penetration of the drive pin in the slot at the extremes of its travel.
