# AN ARRANGEMENT FOR CONTROLLING SWITCHED SPEECH OR DATA CAN ARRANGEMENT FOR CONTROLLING SWITCHED SPEECH OR DATA COMMUNICATION IN A COMMUNICATIONS EXCHANGE OMMUNICATION IN A COMMUNICATIONS EXCHANGE

## Abstract
The arrangement is for controlling speech communi cation in a communications exchange. The speech trans mission is handled by a switchblock composed of a number of digital switching modules interconnected by a plurality of wire connections, and requiring the speech signals to be ac companied by bit and frame clock references to allow a re ceiving module to align the incoming data to its clock refer ence. The wire connections which carry frame synchronisa tion information also carry control data which is bit inter leaved with the frame synchronisation information. Circuit means is provided which receives the bit interleaved frame synchronisation information and control data, and demulti plexes the frame synchronisation and control data to pro vide a retimed control data signal for use at the receiving module.
