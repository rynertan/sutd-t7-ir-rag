## Description
FLEX ADJUSTING Deuce PARTIOULARLY FOR ml ENTRANCE SKI BOOTS This invention relates to a flex adjusting device particularly for rear entrance ski boots. As in known, rear entrance ski boots are finding ever increasing popularity comprising, in their commonest form, a shell having front and rear quarters connected thereto, Such ski boots pose, however, considerable problem as regards the incorporation of suitable devices for adjusting the amount of flex, flex referring herein to the bias force opposed by a ski boot to the flexing movement of the quarter about a substantially horizontal axis lying perpendicularly to the ski length direction. Prior devices tend to be excessively bulky, difficult to adjust, and unable to provide for continuous and quick control of the amount of flex. It is a primary object of this invention to obviate such prior shortcomings by providing a flex adjusting device which is easily incorporated to a ski boot without involving any major structural alterations and is quite convenient to use. A further object of the invention is to provide such a device which can also be adjusted in adverse environmental conditions, such as are normally encoun tered in the skiing field,evelly a person donning mittens. It is another object of the invention to provide a device as indicated, wherein the flex opposing bias force from the ski boot can be adjusted continuously over a wide range so as to comfortably meet any contingent requirements by the user. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a flex adjusting device particularly for rear entrance ski boots, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises a friction element associated with the bottom surface of the front quarter of a ski boot and acting in rubbing contact with a backplate attached to the shell of said ski boot, adjustable calibration elastic means being also provided to control the contact pressure between said friction element and said backplate. Further features and advantages will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of a flex adjusting device particularly for rear entrance ski boots, with reference to the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematical perspective view of a ski boot incorporating a flex adjusting device according to the invention, mounted on the front thereof Figure 2 is a sectional view of the device ofFigure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view showing schematically a ski boot with this flex adjusting device mounted laterally thereof Figure 4 is a sectional view of the device ofFigure 3 and Figure 5 shows thi. dWestio as comprising a variable thickness friction plato. With reference to the drawing views, and in particular to Figures 1 and 2, a flex ad ting device particularly for rear entrance ski boots, according to the invention, comprises a friction element comprising a friction plate 1 Ehich is located below the toe portion of the front quarter 2 of a ski boot. More in detail, in the embodiment shown inFigures 1 and 2, the friction plate 1 is located at the front upper portion of the boot, at a front proJection 3 defined by the quarter itself. The cited friction plate t is associated with the shank 4 of a throughgoing pin which has its enlarged head 5 located inside the shell 6. The shank 4 is passed slidably through an elongate slot 7 defined in the front upper portion of the shell 6. The shank 4 has, at its other end, a threaded portion 8 wherewith a control knob 9 engages rotatably which acts at the top of said front quarter 2, at the projection or protuberance 3 thereof. The cited friction plate is in rubbing contact with a backplate 10 located on the shell 6 and being connected to the shell by fastening means comprising rivets 11 or the like elements. The backplate 10 is also formed with the throughgoing slot 7 to allow for the sliding movement of the shank 4. Between the friction plate 1 and inner surface of the quarter 2, elastic means are active which comprise a pair of juxtaposed disk springs 12 applying an elastic thrust which in practice controls the contact pressure between the friction plate 7 and backplate 10, thus practically adjusting the braking action applied between the front quarter 2 and shell 6 during the flexing movement. It may be appreciated that the more compressed are the springs 12, the greater becomes said braking action, thereby disfavouring flexing, whereas by attenuating the compression of the springs 12 flexing is facilitated. With reference to Pigures 3 and 4, the flex adjusting device is positioned laterally of the front quarter, and has a friction element comprising a friction plate 20 connected to a small supporting plate 21 attached, as by means of rivets 22 or the like elements, to a protuberance 23 defined on the quarter. Through the friction plate 20, there extends the shank 24 of a pin which is formed at one end with an enlarged portion 25 adapted to engage with the inner face of a friction backplate 30 attached to the shell 6 and formed with an elongate slot 31 to permit sliding of the shank 24. At the region occupied by the elongate slot 31, the shell 6 is advantageously formed with a cutout 32 to avoid interference with the enlarged portion0 The shank 24 has, at its other end, a threaded portion 35 wherewith an adjustment ring nut 36 engages which is acoeaasble from the outside of the protuberance 23 and acts against elastic means comprising a bell like spring 40 carried directly on the supporting plate 21. Here again, by adjusting the ring nut 36, the spring 40 is compressed to a greater or lesser extent, thus varying the pressure exerted by the friction plate 20 on the friction backplate 30. With reference to Figure 5, associated with the shell is a friction plate 50, defining a varying thickness along the direction of longitudinal development, which p d erably increasea in thickness toward the shell toe endue plate 50 defines an ovate slot 51 wherethrough a threaded stem 52 is passed which has an enlarged end portion 53. The stem 52 is passed through a lower friction disk 54 and upper friction disk 55, which are in rubbing contact relationship with the plate 50 and supported on the quarter 2. Further, the stem 52 engages in a threaded receptacle 56 defined in a gripping element 57 carried rotatably on the quarter 2. Between the enlarged portion 53 and disk 54, with the optional interposition of a washer 58, there are arranged to act elastic means comprising an adjustable calibration spring 60 which can be calibrated by operating the grip 57 to cause the stem 52 to translate, thereby varying the frictional force applicable between the plate 50 and diaks 54,55. Advantageously, the plate 50 has at least one inclined surface, and the contacting disk correspondingly presents a matching juxtaposed inclined surface. With this arrangement, the flex adjusting effect is enhanced. The use of the device according to the invention is quite simple. In fact, the user is simply required to adjust the knob 9 or ring nut 36 or grip 57 in conformity with his her own requirements by applying a desired compression of the elastic means and hence adjusting the frictional pressure between the friction plate 1 and backplate 10 or between the friction plate 20 and friction backplate 30 or between the plate 50 and disks 54 and 55, this changing flexure as required with an action which practically varies the frictional pressure between parts in mutual rubbing contact. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular the fact should be pointed out that a device has been provided whereby the flefibility can be adjusted in an extremely simple and quick manner through the utilization of the friction differential, occurring as the applied pressure is varied, between a friction plate and respective backplate attached to the boot shell. In practicing the invention,any materials, dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any selected ones and used to meet individual requirements, providing that they are compatible with the specific intended application.
