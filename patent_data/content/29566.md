# Process for the production of a polyamide base resin composition.

## Abstract
A polyamide based resin composition is prepared mix ing a resin composition with a urea compound of the for mula R² NHCONH R¹ NHCONH R³ wherein R¹ is an aromatic hydrocarbon group and R² and R³ are both aliphatic groups of 8 to 32 carbon atoms, said resin composition being pre pared by melt mixing 99 to 40 parts by weight of a polyamide resin and 1 to 60 parts by weight of a modified ethylene copolymer prepared by graft copolymerizing a copolymer of ethylene and an α olefin of at least three carbon atoms with an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivative thereof.
