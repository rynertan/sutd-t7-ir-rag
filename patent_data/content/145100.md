# OFFSET REDUCTION FOR FAST COMPARATORS EMPLOYING SERIES CONNECTED, SINGLE ENDED GAIN STAGES

## Abstract
A method of operation is provided for a fast comparator 10 which contains multiple series connected, single ended gain stages 113, 115, 117, 119 . High resolution comparison is possible due to the reduction in offset by this method of operating the comparator, The offset of the first gain stage 113 is made to dissappear by placing it in an open loop mode prior to the turning on of the successive single ended gain stages. The errors of successive single ended gain stages are made to appear of less consequence because they are reduced by the inverse of the open loop gain of the upstream stage.
