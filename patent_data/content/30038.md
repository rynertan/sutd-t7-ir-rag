## Description
1,2,4 Triazine Derivatives, Process for their Production, Pharmaceutical Composition and their Use. The present invention relates to 1,2,4 triazine derivatives, and their production and use. More particularly, it relates to 1,2,4 triazine derivatives of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Ar is a phenyl group substituted with halogen, C1 C8 alkyl, C1 C8 alkoxy, C1 C8 alkylthio, C1 C8 alkylsulfonyl, nitro, trihalomethyl, cyano, C1 C8 alkylamino, di C1 C8 alkylamino, amino, hydroxyl, phenyl and or phenoxy, a naphthyl group or a thienyl group optionally substituted with halogen, their preparation process and their antifungal use. In the above significances, the alkyl moiety may be straight or branched, and can cover methyl, ethyl, npropyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, tert butyl, npentyl, n hexyl, n heptyl, n octyl, etc. Among them, those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms are preferred. The number of the substituent s which should be present on the phenyl group or may be present on the thienyl group is usually not more than 3. The said 1,2,4 triazine derivatives I can be prepared, for instance, by reacting a keto carboxylic acid or its ester of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a C1 Co alkyl group and Ar is as defined above, with 2 pyridylhydrazidine of the formula EMI2.2 The keto carboxylic acid or its ester II is known or can be easily prepared by a pQr se known procedure as described in Organic Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 241 1941 .The 2 pyridylhydrazidine III is known and described inJ.Org.Chem., 30, 931 1955 . The reaction is readily carried out by treating the keto carboxylic acid or its ester II with 2 pyridylhydrazidine III , usually in an equimolar proportion. It is particularly preferred to effect the treatment in an inert solvent such as an alkanol e.g. methanol, ethanol , an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane , a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride , dimethylformamide or water at a temperature between OOC and 3000C, especially between 60QC and 2000C. The said reaction between the keto carboxylic acid or its ester II and 2 pyridylhydrazidine III may be considered to proceed through the following intermediary compound EMI3.1 wherein Ar and R are each as defined above. When the ketoextbaxylic acid II R H is used as the starting material, its reaction with 2 pyridylhydrazidine III at a temperature not higher than room temperature can afford the corresponding compound IV R H , which may be heated, with or without isolation from the reaction mixture, above room temperature to give the objective 1,2,4 triazine derivative I with ease.When the keto carboxylic acid II R H is reacted with 2 pyridylhydrazidine III under heating, the corresponding intermediary compound IV R H is hardly isolated, and the objective 1,2,4 triazine derivative I is directly produced. In case of the starting material being the keto carboxylic ester II R C1 C4 alkyl , the corresponding intermediary compound IV R C1 C4 alkyl is hardly produced even when the reaction is effected at low temperature, and there is obtained directly the objective 1,2,4 triazine derivative I .
