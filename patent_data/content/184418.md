# D.C. rotary electrical machine.

## Abstract
A D.C. rotary electric machine comprises an armature winding 3 having a plurality of unit coils A and a commutator 8 having a plurality of commutator segments 8a. Each unit coil includes a pair of coil sides 3a and is connected between two commutator segments. The unit coils are positioned with respect to the commutator segments so that a centre line passing in parallel through the midpoint between the adjacent commutator segments 8a to which a unit coil is connected is circumferentially advanced by a predetermined angle with respect to a centre line passing in parallel through the midpoint between the two coils sides of the unit coil.
