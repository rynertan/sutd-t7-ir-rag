## Description
This invention relates to a rotating electric motor, and more particularly to a rotating electric motor comprising an armature core made of magnetic material having a plurality of teeth and a plurality of overlapping winding coils of polyphase winding groups, and a field permanent magnet member which is polarized to have a plurality of alternating N and S poles and opposed to said teeth of the armature core, the number of the N and S poles being P which is an even number, and the number of the teeth being T which is not less than 2P. A rotating electric motor comprising an armature core of magnetic material having a plurality of teeth and a field permanent magnet member having magnetized poles opposed to the teeth is widely used as it has high efficiency. But, the conventional rotating electric motor has such a problem that a harmful vibration occurs owing to an intense cogging torque generated by the interaction between the magnetized poles of the permanent magnet and the teeth of the armature core. This cogging torque prevents smooth rotation of the rotating electric motor. In order to reduce the cogging torque, a skewed armature core is used in some cases. But, it is difficult to make the skewed armature core, and the cogging torque is not reduced enough sometimes by the skewed armature core. Use of an armature core having no tooth for getting smooth rotation is impractical because of its low efficiency which necessitates a large size of motor. A construction of a rotating electric motor with reduced cogging torque is disclosed in the United States Patent 4,280,072 or the Japanese Laid open Patent Application 55 71163. In these patent specifications, indented portions are used to reduce the cogging torque. This method is remarkably effective in such case that the number T of the teeth is smaller than the double of the number P of the N and S poles, that is T 2P, such as the rotating electric motors shown in Figure 1, Figure 5 and Figure 6 in USP 4,280,072, since the face of each of the teeth is wide enough to provide a number of indented portions. But, the cogging torque of a rotating electric motor such as shown in Figure 8 in USP 4,280,072, in which T is not less than 2P, is not sufficiently reduced by the above method the same rotating electric motor is disclosed in the Japanese Laid open Patent Application 55 71163 . The conventional rotating electric motors are described hereinbelow. Figure 1 is a schematic sectional view of a conventional rotating electric motor with T 6P. In Figure 1, a cylindrical permanent magnet 3 is fixed to the outer circumference of a rotor 2 made of magnetic material, and the permanent magnet 3 rotates with the rotor 2 around a rotary shaft 1. The permanent magnet 3 has 4 poles of alternating N and S poles positioned at intervals of an equal angle of 90 degrees, that is, P 4. The teeth 6 of an armature core 4, each of which is formed between two adjacent winding slots 5, are faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 3. The rotary shaft 1 of the rotor 2 is rotatably supported by the armature core 4. Therefore, the relative position between the teeth 6 of the armature core 4 and the poles of the permanent magnet 3 changes according to the rotation of the rotor 2. Figure 2 shows a development view of the conventional motor of Figure 1 developed at the lines X X and Y Y , when these lines are in a line. The armature core 4 has 24 winding slots a to x at intervals of an equal angle of 15 degrees, and 24 teeth are provided between two adjacent winding slots, that is, T 24. Overlapping winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are wound in the winding slots a to x. Each of the winding coils A1 to C4 encircles 5 teeth of the armature core 4.

The winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 are connected in series to form a winding group A of the first phase, the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 are connected in series to form a winding group B of the second phase, and the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected in series to form a winding group C of the third phase. The phase difference among the winding groups A, B and C is equal to 120el electrical degree , where 180el is equivalent to 1 pole pitch of 360 P degree of the permanent magnet 3. In Figure 1, P 4, then 180el is equivalent to 90 degrees mechanical degree . Therefore, a torque accelerating the rotor 2 is obtained by supplying three phase currents to the three phase winding groups A, B and C. Figure 3 is a schematic sectional view of another conventional rotating electric motor with T 3P. The structure of the conventional motor shown in Figure 3 is the same as that of the conventional motor shown in Figure 1, except the relation between T and P, and the winding pitch. A cylindrical permanent magnet 13 is fixed to the outer circumference of a rotor 12 made of magnetic material, and the permanent magnet 13 rotates with the rotor 12 around a rotary shaft 11. The permanent magnet 13 has 4 poles of alternating N and S poles positioned by an equal angle of 90 degrees, that is, P 4. The teeth 16 of an armature core 14, each of which is formed between two adjacent winding slots 15, are faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 13. The rotary shaft 11 of the rotor 12 is rotatably supported by the armature core 14. Therefore, the relative position between the teeth 16 of the armature core 14 and the poles of the permanent magnet 13 changes according to the rotation of the rotor 12. Figure 4 shows a development view of the conventional motor of Figure 3 developed at the lines X X and Y Y , when these lines are in a line. The armature core 14 has 12 winding slots a to 1 at intervals of an equal angle of 30 degrees, and 12 teeth are provided between two adjacent winding slots, that is, T 12. Overlapping winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are wound in the winding slots a to 1. Each of the winding coils A1 to C4 encircles 3 of the teeth of the armature core 14. That is, A1 is wound in the winding slots a and d, A2 is wound in the winding slots d and g, A3 is wound in the winding slots g and j, A4 is wound in the winding slots j and a, B1 is wound in the winding slots c and f, B2 is wound in the winding slots f and i, B3 is wound in the winding slots i and 1, B4 is wound in the winding slots 1 and c, C1 is wound in the winding slots e and h, C2 is wound in the winding slots h and k, C3 is wound in the winding slots k and b, and C4 is wound in the winding slots b and e. The winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 are connected in series to form a winding group A of the first phase, the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 are connected in series to form a winding group B of the second phase, and the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected in series to form a winding group C of the third phase. The phase difference among the winding groups A, B and C is equal to 120el. In Figure 3, P 4, then 180el is equivalent to 90 degrees mechanical degree . Therefore, a torque accelerating the rotor 2 is obtained by supplying three phase currents to the three phase winding groups A, B and C. An electrical machine with an apparatus for minimizing magnetic cogging is disclosed in US A 4424 463, where the stator is divided into pairs of angular pie shaped segments, the number P of poles being 36. An object of the present invention is to provide a noble and improved rotating electric motor of high efficiency with reduced cogging torque. Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotating electric motor comprising an armature core of magnetic material having T teeth and a field permanent magnet member having P permanently magnetized N and S poles, where T is not less than 2P, and having reduced cogging torque which is related to the geometry of the armature core and the magnet.

The effective pitch of each short tooth is smaller than D 360 T degree, and the effective pitch of each long tooth is larger than D. The above objects of the invention are achieved also by providing a rotating electric motor according to the invention, which comprises a field permanent magnet member of a circular form having permanently magnetized N and S poles alternately positioned around a rotary shaft of said electric motor, the number of said N and S poles being P which is an even number and an armature core made of magnetic material having a plurality of teeth made between two adjacent winding slots where a plurality of overlapping winding coils of polyphase winding groups are wound, the number of said teeth being T which is not less than 2P, and the number of the phases of said polyphase winding groups being H which is not less than 2 wherein said armature core has at least one short tooth and at least one long tooth.

The whole effective pitch of sequential L teeth of said armature core is equal or almost equal to 360 P Q degree, where L is an integer larger than H and Q is an integer not less than 2. The ratio of the smallest value of the effective pitches of the teeth to the effective pitch of the m th tooth in said sequential L teeth is R R Vm, where R is an integer not less than 1 and Vm is an integer including 0, and the sum of Vm from m 1 to m L is W which is not equal to an integral multiple of Qd, where Qd is a divisor of Q and larger than 1. The above objects of the invention are achieved also by providing a rotating electric motor according to the invention, which comprises a field permanent magnet member of a circular form having permanently magnetized N and S poles alternately positioned around a rotary shaft of said electric motor, the number of said N and S poles being which is an even number and an armature core made of magnetic material having a plurality of teeth made between two adjacent winding slots where a plurality of overlapping winding coils of the polyphase winding groups are wound, the number of said teeth being T which is not less than 2P, and the number of the phases of said polyphase winding groups being H which is not less than 2 wherein at least one of said teeth has at least one dummy slot portion, and said armature core has at least first and second slot groups.

A second pitch between adjacent winding slots of said first slot group and said second slot group is not equal to an integral multiple of said first pitch. A precise definition of the present invention is given in the claims. The above and other objects and features of the invention will be apparent from consideration of the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 5 shows a schematic sectional view of an embodiment of a brushless DC motor of the invention with T 6P, which corresponds to the conventional rotating electric motor shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In Figure 5, a cylindrical permanent magnet 23 is fixed to the outer circumference of a rotor 22 made of magnetic material, and the permanent magnet 23 rotates with the rotor 22 around a rotary shaft 21. The permanent magnet 23 has 4 poles of alternating N and S poles positioned at intervals of an equal angle of 90 degrees, that is, P 4, where P is the number of the poles of the permanent magnet 23. Figure 6 shows a distribution of the magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet 23. The teeth 26 of an armature core 24, each of which is formed between two adjacent winding slots 25, are faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 23. The rotary shaft 21 of the rotor 22 is rotatably supported by the armature core 24. Therefore, the relative position between the teeth 26 of the armature core 24 and the poles of the permanent magnet 23 changes according to the rotation of the rotor 22. Figure 7 shows a development view of the brushless DC motor of Figure 5 developed at the lines X X and Y Y , when these lines are in a line. The armature core 24 has 24 winding slots a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w and x, and 24 teeth are provided between two adjacent winding slots, that is, T 24, where T is the number of the teeth of the armature core 24. The armature core 24 also has 3 dummy slot portions a , b and c at the faces of some of the teeth opposed to the permanent magnet 23, and no coils are wound in the dummy slot portions. Overlapping winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are wound in the winding slots a to x. Each of the winding coils A1 to C4 encircles 5 teeth of the armature core 24. That is, A1 is wound in the winding slots a and f. A2 is wound in the winding slots g and 1, A3 is wound in the winding slots m and r, A4 is wound in the winding slots s and x, B1 is wound in the winding slots e and j, B2 is wound in the winding slots k and p, B3 is wound in the winding slots q and v, B4 is wound in the winding slots w and d, C1 is wound in the winding slots i and n, C2 is wound in the winding slots o and t, C3 is wound in the winding slots u and b, and C4 is wound in the winding slots c and h. The winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 are connected in series to form a winding group A of the first phase, the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 are connected in series to form a winding group B of the second phase, and the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected in series to form a winding group C of the third phase. As will be described later, the phase differences among the winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el electrical degree , where 180el is equivalent to 1 pole pitch of 360 P degree. In Figure 5, P 4, then 180el is equivalent to 90 degrees mechanical degree , which is the same as that of the conventional motor of Figure 1. Therefore, a torque accelerating the rotor 22 is obtained by supplying three phase currents to the three phase winding groups A, B and C. Figure 8 shows an electronic distributor 30 for the brushless DC motor of the invention. The electronic distributor 30 has a driver 31 and a position detector 32, and supplies to the star connected three phase winding groups A, B and C with three phase currents I1, I2 and I3, respectively. The position detector 32 detects the relative position between the armature core 24 and the permanent magnet 23, and it outputs three phase sinusoidal signal P1, P2 and P3 which change with the rotation of the rotor 22 by detecting the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet 23. The driver 31 outputs the three phase currents I1, I2 and I3, which are proportional to a command signal F multiplied by the output signals P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Thus, a torque for accelerating the rotor 22 is generated by the interaction between the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet 23 and the three phase currents I1, I2 and I3 to the winding groups A, B and C. The electromagnetic torque by the three phase currents will be described later in detail. In Figure 7, since the winding slots a to x are positioned at intervals of unequal angles, the effective pitches of the teeth are not the same, where the effective pitch of a tooth is defined as the angle between the centres of the adjacent winding slots forming the tooth. In the case of T 6P 24 P 4 , the standard effective pitch is D 360 T 15 degree when all of the winding slots are positioned at intervals of an equal angle. So, a tooth having the effective pitch smaller than D is called a short tooth , and a tooth having the effective pitch larger than D is called a long tooth in the specification. And a tooth is designated by the adjacent winding slots forming the tooth. For example, the tooth a b means the tooth formed by the winding slots a and b. In Figure 7, the teeth a b, b c, c d, d e, e f, f g, g h, i j, j k, k l, l m, m n, n o, o p, q r, r s, s t, t u, u v, v w and w x are short teeth, and the teeth h i, p q and x a are long teeth. A block having at least one short tooth and no long tooth positioned sequentially is called a short block , and a block having at least one long tooth and no short tooth positioned sequentially is called a long block in the specification. And a block is designated by the winding slots positioned at the both sides of the block. For example, the block a,h means the block of the teeth a b, b c, c d, d e, e f, f g and g h. In Figure 7, there are three short blocks a,h , i,p and q,x that are the short block of the teeth a b, b c, c d, d e, e f, f g and g h, the short block of the teeth i j, j k, k l, l m, m n, n o and o p, and the short block of the teeth q r, r s, s t, t u, u v, v w, respectively. And there are three long blocks h,i p,q and x,a that are the long block of the tooth h i, the long block of the tooth p q, and the long block of the tooth x a, respectively. Notice that it is not the number of the teeth to classify the block but the nature of the teeth including. Each of the short blocks a,h , i,p and q,x has 7 short teeth, and each of the long blocks h,i , p,q and x,a has only one long tooth. The armature core 24 of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 5 and Figure 7 has 3 pairs of short blocks and long blocks positioned alternately around the rotary shaft 21, and these 3 pairs of short blocks and long blocks are symmetrical with respect to the rotary shaft 21. Each of the effective pitches of the short teeth a b, b c, c d, d e, e f, f g, g h, i j, j k, k l, l m, m n, n o, o p, q r, r s, s t, t u, u v, v w and w x is equal or nearly equal to 360 27 13.333 degree, and each of the effective pitches of the long teeth h i, p q and x a is equal or nearly equal to 720 27 26.667 degree. Thus, the ratio of the effective pitch of each of the short teeth to the effective pitch of each of the long teeth is 1 2. The long tooth h i has a dummy slot portion a at its centre portion faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 23, the long tooth p q has a dummy slot portion b at its centre portion, and the long tooth x a has a dummy slot portion c at its centre portion. Therefore, the winding slots a to x and the dummy slot portions a to c are positioned at intervals of an equal or nearly equal angle of 360 27 13.333 degree. Next, the cogging torque of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 5 will be explained hereinbelow. Cogging torque is generated by the interaction between the permanent magnet and the armature core, more particularly by changing the magnetic energy stored in the air gap according to the relative rotation between the permanent magnet and the armature core, and it changes periodically according to the relative position thereof with a basic period of 360 degree one revolution . This is harmful for getting a smooth rotation of the rotating electric motor. The cogging torque is influenced by the shape of the armature core facing to the permanent magnet and by the distribution of the magnetic charge in the poles of the permanent magnet. The shape of the armature core is represented by shape harmonics expanded by the Fourier series with the basic period of 360 degree, and the shape harmonics is proper to the shape of the armature core. The distribution of the magnetic charge is represented by the magnetic distribution harmonics also expanded by the Fourier series with the basic period 360 degree, and the magnetic distribution harmonics is proper to the distribution of the magnetic charge in the permanent magnet. Mathematically, the cogging torque is determined by the convolution between the shape harmonics and the magnetic distribution harmonics, and is also expanded by the Fourier series with the basic period 360 degree. The magnitude of each component cycle revolution of the cogging torque is proportional to the product of the component of the shape harmonics and the component of the magnetic distribution harmonics of the same degree number as that of the cogging torque. Since the magnetic energy in the air gap is proportional to the square value of the magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet and the distribution of the magnetic flux density shown in Figure 6 is symmetrical with regard to the polarities, the magnetic distribution harmonics of the permanent magnet 23 is a periodic function with the period of 1 pole pitch 360 P 90 degree. Thus, the cogging torque becomes small when the composite magnetic variation of the shape harmonics of the armature core 24 with the period of 1 pole pitch becomes small. Figure 10 shows phases of the winding slots a to x and the dummy slot portions a to c of the armature core 24 with the period of 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet 23. The winding slots a, f, g, l, m, r, s and x, where the winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the winding group A are wound, and the dummy slot portion c are positioned at intervals of a phase difference of 1 pole pitch 27. That is, the phases of the winding slots a, f, g, l, m, r, s and x and the dummy slot portion c differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 21, and the range of the phases of the winding slots a, f, g, l, m, r, s and x is within 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots d, e, j, k, p, q, v and w, where the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 of the winding group B are wound, and the dummy slot portion b are positioned at intervals of the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 27, and the range of the phases of the winding slots d, e, j, k, p, q, v and w is within 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots b, c, h, i, n, o, t and u, where the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 of the winding group C are wound, and the dummy slot portion a are positioned at intervals of the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 27, and the range of the phases of the winding slots b, c, h, i, n, o, t and u is within 1 pole pitch 3. Further, the phase differences among the winding slot group a, f, g, l, m, r, s, x for the winding group A, the winding slot group d, e, j, k, p, q, v, w for the winding group B and the winding slot group b, c, h, i, n, o, t, u for the winding group C are exactly equal to 1 pole pitch 3. As the result of this, the phase differences among the three phase winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el degree. All of the phases of the winding slots a to x and the dummy slot portions a to c are different by the phase difference of 1 pole pitch 27, and it is expected that the composite magnetic variation with the period of 1 pole pitch becomes small. Figure 11 shows waveforms of the magnetic variations of the winding slots a to x and the dummy slot portions a to c and a waveform of the composite magnetic variation Tv of the armature core 24. The magnetic variation of each of the winding slots and dummy slot portions changes smoothly corresponding to the each opening width, and each of the dummy slot portions a , b and c has same magnetic effect as that of each of the winding slots a to x. Since the phases of the winding slots and the dummy slot portions differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 27, the composite magnetic variation Tv becomes considerably small. Figure 12 shows a waveform of the composite magnetic variation Tv of the armature core 4 of the conventional rotating electric motor shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In the case of the conventional rotating electric motor, the phases of the winding slots a, g, m and s are the same with the period of 1 pole pitch, the phases of the winding slots b, h, n and t are the same, the phases of the winding slots c, i, o and u are the same, the phases of the winding slots d, j, p and v are the same, the phases of the winding slots e, k, q and w are the same, and the phases of the winding slots f, l, r and x are the same. So, the composite magnetic variation Tv is large. Comparing the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 11 with the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 12, Tv of the motor of the invention is much smaller than Tv of the conventional motor. Therefore, the embodiment of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 5 has few cogging torque. Notice that the cogging torque of the brushless DC motor of Figure 5 without the dummy slot portions is also small, because the composite magnetic variation of the armature core 24 without the dummy slot portions is smaller than the composite magnetic variation Tv of the conventional armature core 4 shown in Figure 12. Next, the electromagnetic torque of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 5 will be explained hereinbelow. The electromagnetic torque is the sum of the generated torques by the three phase currents I1, I2 and I3 supplied to the three phase winding groups A, B and C, and each of the generated torques of the three phase winding groups A, B and C by each of the currents I1, I2 and I3 is the product of the current and the flux density. Thus, the electromagnetic torque Tor is But the actual distribution of the permanent magnet 23 of Figure 6 has higher components of 3rd, 5th, 7th, and so on. These higher components, especially 3rd, 5th and 7th, produce a ripple torque, and this ripple torque prevents smooth rotation of the motor as well as cogging torque. Since the phases of the winding slots for each winding group A, B or C are different within 1 pole pitch 3 , the equivalent effective flux densities Ba, Bb and Bc have reduced components of 3rd, 5th, 7th, and so on. Assuming that the distribution of the flux density of the permanent magnet 23 is as follows The winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 of the armature core 24 in the above embodiment can be automatically wound by a winding machine, because the winding pitches of these winding coils are almost equal to 5 6 of the 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet 23, where the winding pitch of a winding coil is the angle between the centres of the winding slots in which the winding coil is wound. The winding pitches of these winding coils A1 to C4 are between 133.3el and 160el. More specifically, the winding pitches of the winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are 133.3el, 160el, 160el, 133.3el, 160el, 133.3el, 133.3el, 160el, 133.3el, 160el, 160el and 133.3el, respectively. In the case of the above embodiment, an electronic distributor supplying polyphase winding groups with polyphase sinusoidal currents is used, but the construction of the distributor does not relate to the cogging torque the distributor relates to only the ripple torque . So, a mechanical brush commutator can be replaced with the electronic distributor shown in Figure 8. Besides, although the permanent magnet 23 of Figure 5 is formed in a continuous circular form, a magnet formed of separate parts with gaps therebetween can also be used in the invention. As mentioned before, the cogging torque of the rotating electric motor of the invention is small even if the dummy slot portions are deleted. Generally speaking, cogging torque can be reduced by providing a rotating electric motor which comprises a field permanent magnet member of a circular form and an armature core made of magnetic material, said magnet member having permanently magnetized N and S poles alternately positioned around a rotary shaft of said rotary electric motor, the number of said N and S poles is P which is an even number, said armature core having a plurality of teeth made between two adjacent winding slots where a plurality of overlapping winding coils of polyphase winding groups are wound, the number of said teeth being T which is not less than 2P, and the number of the phases of said polyphase winding groups being H which is not less than 2, wherein said armature core has at least a pair of a short block and a long block alternately positioned around said rotary shaft, each of said short blocks having at least two short teeth and no long tooth, and each of said long blocks having at least one long tooth and no short tooth, where each of the effective pitches of said short teeth is smaller than D 360 T degree, and each of the effective pitches of said long teeth is larger than D. It is preferable that the number of the pairs of short blocks and long blocks is an integral multiple of H. It is also preferable that the whole effective pitch of sequential H pairs of short blocks and long blocks is equal or almost equal to 360 P Q degree, and the number of said teeth at a pair of neighbouring short block and long block in said sequential H pairs is an integral multiple of Q, where Q is an integer not less than 2 and preferably not equal to an integral multiple of H. It is also preferable that the number of said teeth in a pair of neighbouring short block and long block is not equal to an integral multiple of H.

In the cases of the above embodiments, 3 pairs of short blocks and long blocks are symmetrically positioned around the rotary axis, but the construction of the rotating electric motor of the invention having reduced cogging torque is not limited to such cases. Generally speaking, cogging torque can be reduced by providing a rotating electric motor which comprises a field permanent magnet member of a circular form having permanently magnetized N and S poles alternately positioned around a rotary shaft of said rotary electric motor, the number of said N and S poles being P which is an even number and an armature core made of magnetic material having a plurality of teeth made between two adjacent winding slots where a plurality of overlapping winding coils of polyphase winding groups are wound, the number of said teeth being T which is not less than 2P, and the number of the phases of said polyphase winding groups being H which is not less than 2 wherein said armature core has at least one short tooth and at least one long tooth, the effective pitch of each short tooth being smaller than D 360 T degree, and the smaller effective pitch of each long tooth being larger than D and wherein the whole effective pitch of sequential L teeth of said armature core is equal or almost equal to 360 P Q degree, where L is an integer larger than H and Q is an integer not less than 2, and the ratio of the smallest value of the effective pitches of the teeth to the effective pitch of the m th tooth in said sequential L teeth is R R Vm, where R is an integer not less than 1 and Vm is an integer including O, the sum of Vm from m 1 to m L being W which is not equal to an integral multiple of Qd, where Qd is a divisor of Q and larger than 1.

Dummy slot portions are provided on the faces of the long teeth and one of the short teeth so that the winding slots and the dummy slot portions are positioned at intervals of 1 angular unit. Embodiments of the Invention with T 3P Figure 13 is a schematic sectional view of another embodiment of a brushless DC motor of the invention with T 3P, which corresponds to the conventional rotating electric motor shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 13, a cylindrical permanent magnet 43 is fixed to the outer circumference of a rotor 42 made of magnetic material, and the permanent magnet 43 rotates with the rotor 42 around a rotary shaft 41. The permanent magnet 43 has 4 poles of alternating N and S poles positioned at intervals of an equal angle of 90 degree, that is, P 4. The distribution of the magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet 43 is the same as that shown in Figure 6. The teeth 46 of an armature core 44, each of which is formed between two adjacent winding slots 45, are faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 43. The rotary shaft 41 of the rotor 42 is rotatably supported by the armature core 44. Therefore, the relative position between the teeth 46 of the armature core 44 and the poles of the permanent magnet 43 changes according to the rotation of the rotor 42. Figure 14 shows a development view of the brushless DC motor of the invention of Figure 13 developed at the lines X X and Y Y , when these lines are in a line. The armature core 44 has 12 winding slots, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k and l, and 12 teeth are provided between two adjacent winding slots, that is, T 12. The armature core 44 also has 3 dummy slot portions a , b and c at the faces of some of the teeth opposed to the permanent magnet 43, and no coils are wound in the dummy slot portions. Overlapping winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are wound in the winding slots a to 1. Each of the winding coils A1 to C4 encircles 3 teeth of the armature core 44. That is, A1 is wound in the winding slots a and d, A2 is wound in the winding slots d and g, A3 is wound in the winding slots g and j, A4 is wound in the winding slots j and a, B1 is wound in the winding slots c and f, B2 is wound in the winding slots f and i, B3 is wound in the winding slots i and l, B4 is wound in the winding slots l and c, C1 is wound in the winding slots e and h, C2 is wound in the winding slots h and k, C3 is wound in the winding slots k and b, and C4 is wound in the winding slots b and e. The winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 are connected in series to form a winding group A of the first phase, the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 are connected in series to form a winding group B of the second phase, and the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected in series to form a winding group C of the third phase. As will be described later, the phase differences among the winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el electrical degree , where 180el is equivalent to the 1 pole pitch 360 P degree. In Figure 13, P 4, then 180el is equivalent to 90 degree mechanical degree , which is the same as that of the conventional motor of Figure 3. Therefore, a torque accelerating the rotor 42 is obtained by supplying three phase currents to the three phase winding groups A, B and C. The electronic distributor 30 shown in Figure 8 is also usable for the brushless DC motor of the invention of Figure 13. In Figure 14, since the winding slots a to l are positioned at intervals of unequal angles, the effective pitches of the teeth are not the same. In the case of T 3P 12 P 4 , the standard effective pitch is D 360 T 30 degree when all of the winding slots are positioned at intervals of an equal angle. So, a short tooth has the effective pitch smaller than D, and a long tooth has the effective pitch larger than D. In Figure 14, the teeth, a b, b c, c d, e f, f g, g h, i j, j k and k l are short teeth, and the teeth d e, h i and l a are long teeth. There are three short blocks a,d , e,h and i,l that are the short block of the teeth a b, b c, and c d, the short block of the teeth e f, f g and g h, and the short block of the teeth i j, j k and k l, respectively. And there are three long blocks d,e , h,i and l,a that are the long block of the tooth d e, the long block of the tooth h i, and the long block of the tooth l a, respectively. Each of the short blocks a,d , e,h and i,l has 3 short teeth, and each of the long blocks d,e , h,i and l,a has only one long tooth. The armature core 44 of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14 has 3 pairs of short blocks and long blocks positioned alternately around the rotary shaft 41, and these 3 pairs of short blocks and long blocks are symmetrical with respect to the rotary shaft 41. Each of the effective pitches of the short teeth a b, b c, c d, e f, f g, g h, i j, j k and k l is equal or nearly equal to 360 15 24 degree, and each of the effective pitches of the long teeth d e, h i and l a is equal or nearly equal to 720 15 48 degree. Thus, the ratio of the effective pitch of each of the short teeth to the effective pitch of each of the long teeth is 1 2. The long tooth d e has a dummy slot portion a at its centre portion faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 43, the long tooth h i has a dummy slot portion b at its centre portion, and the long tooth l a also has a dummy slot portion c at its centre portion. Therefore, the winding slots a to l and the dummy slot portions a to c are positioned at intervals of an equal or nearly equal angle of 360 15 24 degree. Next, the cogging torque of the embodiment of the invention shorn in Figure 13 will be explained hereinbelow. Figure 15 shows phases of the winding slots a to l and the dummy slot portions a to c of the armature core 44 with the period of 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet 43. The winding slots a, d, g and j, where the winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the winding group A are wound, and the dummy slot portion c are positioned at intervals of a phase difference of 1 pole pitch 15. That is, the phases of the winding slots a, d, g and j and the dummy slot portion c differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 15, and the range of the phases of the winding slots a, d, g and j is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots c, f, i and l, where the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 of the winding group B are wound, and the dummy slot portion b are positioned at intervals of the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 15, and the range of the phases of the winding slots c, f, i and l is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots b, e, h and k, where the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 of the winding group C are wound, and the dummy slot portion a are positioned at intervals of the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 15, and the range of the phases of the winding slots b, e, h and k is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Further, the phase differences among the winding slot group a, d, g, j for the winding group A, the winding slot group c, f, i, l for the winding group B and the winding slot group b, e, h,k for the winding group C are exactly equal to 1 pole pitch 3. As the result of this, the phase differences among the three phase winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el degree, and a smooth torque is obtained by using the distributor 30 of Figure 8. All of the phases of the winding slots a to 1 and the dummy slot portions a to c are different from each other by the phase difference of 1 pole pitch 15, and it is expected that the composite magnetic variation with the period of 1 pole pitch becomes small. Figure 16 shows waveforms of the magnetic variations of the winding slots a to 1 and the dummy slot portions a to c and a waveform of the composite magnetic variation Tv of the armature core 44. The magnetic variation of each of the winding slots and dummy slot portions changes smoothly corresponding to each opening width, and each of the dummy slot portions a , b and c has the same magnetic effect as that of each of the winding slots a to 1. Since the phases of the winding slots and the dummy slot portions differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 15, the composite magnetic variation Tv becomes considerably small. Figure 17 shows a waveform of the composite magnetic variation Tv of the armature core 14 of the conventional rotating electric motor shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In the case of the conventional rotating electric motor, the phases of the winding slots a, d, g and j are the same with the period of the 1 pole pitch, the phases of the winding slots b, e, h and k are the same, and the phases of the winding slots c, f, i and 1 are the same. So, the composite magnetic variation Tv is large. Comparing the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 16 with the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 17, Tv of the motor of the invention is much smaller than Tv of the conventional motor. Therefore, the embodiment of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 13 has few cogging torque. Notice that the cogging torque of the brushless DC motor of Figure 13 without the dummy slot portions is also small, because the composite magnetic variation of the armature core 44 without the dummy slot portions is smaller than the composite magnetic variation Tv of the conventional armature core 14 shown in Figure 17. The winding coils, A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 of the armature core 44 in the above embodiment can be automatically wound by a winding machine, because the winding pitches of these winding coils are almost equal to the 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet 43. The winding pitches of these winding coils A1 to C4 are between 144el and 192el. More specifically, the winding pitches of the winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are 144el, 192el, 192el, 192el, 192el, 192el, 144el, 192el, 144el, 192el, 192el and 192el, respectively. Other constructions of the rotating electric motor of the invention having reduced cogging torque are shown in Table 4 which shows the effective pitches of teeth. In Table 4, arrangement A shows another arrangement of the teeth of the armature core 44 shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. Each of the effective pitches of the short teeth is changed to be equal to 3 angular units and each of the effective pitches of the long teeth is changed to be equal to 3 angular units, where 1 angular unit is 360 27 13.333 degree.

Dummy slot portions are provided on the faces of the long teeth and one of the short teeth so that the winding slots and the dummy slot portions are positioned at intervals of 1 angular unit. Figure 18 shows a schematic sectional view of a further embodiment of the invention with T 3P, which also corresponds to the conventional rotating electric motor shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 18, a cylindrical permanent magnet 53 is fixed to the outer circumference of a rotor 52 made of magnetic material, and the permanent magnet 53 rotates with the rotor 52 around a rotary shaft 51. The permanent magnet 53 has 4 poles of alternating N and S poles positioned at intervals of an equal angle of 90 degree, that is P 4. The distribution of the magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet 53 is the same as that shown in Figure 6. The teeth 56 of an armature core 54, each of which is formed between two adjacent winding slots 55, are faced to the poles of the permanent magnet 53. The rotary shaft 51 of the rotor 52 is rotatably supported by the armature core 54. Therefore, the relative position between the teeth 56 of the armature core 54 and the poles of the permanent magnet 53 changes according to the rotation of the rotor 52. Figure 19 shows a development view of the brush less DC motor of the invention of Figure 18 developed at the lines X X and Y Y , when these lines are in a line. The armature core 54 has 12 winding slots a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k and l, and 12 teeth are provided between two adjacent winding slots, that is, T 12. The armature core 54 also has 6 dummy slot portions a , b , c , d , e and f at the faces of some of the teeth opposed to the permanent magnet 53, and no coils are wound in the dummy slot portions. Overlapping winding coils A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are wound in the winding slots a to 1. Each of the winding coils A1 to C4 encircles 3 of the teeth of the armature core 54. That is, A1 is wound in the winding slots a and d, A2 is wound in the winding slots d and g, A3 is wound in the winding slots g and j, A4 is wound in the winding slots j and a, B1 is wound in the winding slots c and f, B2 is wound in the winding slots f and i, B3 is wound in the winding slots i and l, B4 is wound in the winding slots l and c, C1 is wound in the winding slots e and h, C2 is wound in the winding slots h and k, C3 is wound in the winding slots k and b, and C4 is wound in the winding slots b and e. The winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 are connected in series to form a winding group A of the first phase, the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 are connected in series to form a winding group B of the second phase, and the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected in series to form a winding group C of the third phase. As will be described later, the phase differences among the winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el electrical degree , where 180el is equivalent to the 1 pole pitch 360 P degree. In Figure 18, P 4, then 180el is equivalent to 90 degree mechanical degree , which is the same as that of the conventional motor of Figure 3. Therefore, a torque accelerating the rotor 52 is obtained by supplying three phase currents to the three phase winding groups A, B and C. The electronic distributor 30 shown in Figure 8 is also usable for the brushless DC motor of the invention of Figure 18. In Figure 19, since the winding slots a to l are positioned at intervals of unequal angles, the effective pitches of the teeth are not the same. In the case of T 3P 12 P 4 , the standard effective pitch is D 360 T 30 degree when all of the winding slots are positioned at intervals of an equal angle. So, a short tooth has the effective pitch smaller than D, and a long tooth has the effective pitch larger than D. In Figure 19, the teeth a b, c d, e f, g h, i j and k l are short teeth, and the teeth b c, d e, f g, h i, j k and 1 a are long teeth. There are 6 short blocks a,b , c,d , e,f , g,h , i,j and k,1 , and there are 6 long blocks b,c , d,e , f,g , h,i , j,k and l,a . Each of the short blocks has only one short tooth, and each of the long blocks has only one long tooth. The armature core 54 of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 18 and Figure 19 has 6 pairs of short blocks and long blocks positioned alternately around the rotary shaft 51. Each of the effective pitches of the short teeth a b, c d, e f, g h, i j and k l is equal or nearly equal to 360 18 20 degree, each of the effective pitches of the long teeth b c, d e, h i and j k is equal or nearly equal to 720 18 40 degree, the effective pitch of the long tooth f g is equal or almost equal to 1 5 4 20 45 degree, and the effective pitch of the long tooth 1 a is equal or almost equal to 1 3 4 20 35 degree. Each of the long teeth b c, d e, f g, h i, j k and 1 a has one of the dummy slot portions a , b , c , d , e and f at the faces of the teeth opposed to the poles of the permanent magnet 53. The first slot group is formed by the winding slots a, b, c, d, e and f and the dummy slot portions a , b and c , which are positioned sequentially at intervals of equal angles by the first pitch of 20 degree. The second slot group is formed by the winding slots g, h, i, j, k and l and the dummy slot portions d , e and f , which are also positioned sequentially at intervals of the first pitch. The pitches between adjacent winding slots of the first slot group and the second slot group at both sides are 35 or 45 degree, each of which is not equal to an integral multiple of the first pitch of 20 degree. Next, the cogging torque of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 18 will be explained hereinbelow. Figure 20 shows phases of the winding slots a to 1 and the dummy slot portions a to f of the armature core 54 with the period of 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet 53. The winding slots a, d, g and j, where the winding coils A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the winding group A are wound, and the dummy slot portions c and f are positioned at intervals of a phase difference of 1 pole pitch 18. That is, the phases of the winding slots a, d, g and j and the dummy slot portions c and f differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 18, and the range of the phases of the winding slots a, d, g and j is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots c, f, i and 1, where the winding coils B1, B2, B3 and B4 of the winding group B are wound, and the dummy slot portions a and d are positioned at intervals of the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 13, and the range of the phases of the winding slots c, f, i and 1 is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Similarly, the winding slots b, e, h and k, where the winding coils C1, C2, C3 and C4 of the winding group C are wound, and the dummy slot portions b and e are positioned by the same phase difference of 1 pole pitch 18, and the range of the phases of the winding slots b, e, h and k is smaller than 1 pole pitch 3. Further, the phase differences among the winding slot group a, d, g, j for the winding group A, the winding slot group c, f, i, l for the winding group B and the winding slot group b, e, h, k for the winding group C are exactly equal to 1 pole pitch 3. As the result of this, the phase differences among the three phase winding groups A, B and C are exactly equal to 120el degree, and a smooth torque is obtained by using the distributor 30 of Figure 8. All of the phases of the winding slots a to 1 and the dummy slot portions a to f are different from each other by the phase difference of 1 pole pitch 18, and it is expected that the composite magnetic variation with the period of 1 pole pitch becomes small. Figure 21 shows waveforms of the magnetic variations of the winding slots a to 1 and the dummy slot portions a to f and a waveform of the composite magnetic variation Tv of the armature core 54. The magnetic variation of each of the winding slots and dummy slot portions changes smoothly corresponding to each opening width, and each of the dummy slot portions a , b , c , d , e and f has the same magnetic effect as that of each of the winding slots a to 1. Since the phases of the winding slots and the dummy slot portions differ from each other by 1 pole pitch 18, the composite magnetic variation Tv becomes considerably small. Comparing the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 21 with the composite magnetic variation Tv of Figure 17, Tv of the motor of the invention is much smaller than Tv or the conventional motor. Therefore, the embodiment of the brushless DC motor of the invention shown in Figure 18 has few cogging torque. In the case of the above embodiment of Figure 18, two slot groups are provided in the armature core, but the construction of the rotating electric motor of the invention having reduced cogging torque is not limited to such a case. Generally speaking, cogging torque can be reduced by providing a rotating electric motor which comprises a field permanent magnet member of a circular form and an armature core made of magnetic material, said magnet member having permanently magnetized N and S poles alternately positioned around a rotary shaft of said rotary electric motor, the number of said N and S poles being P which is an even number, said armature core having a plurality of teeth made between two adjacent winding slots where a plurality of overlapping winding coils of the polyphase winding groups are wound, the number of said teeth being T which is not less than 2P, and the number of the phases of said polyphase winding groups being H which is not less than 2, wherein at least one of said teeth has at least one dummy slot portion, said armature core having at least first and second slot groups, said dummy slot portions and said winding slots in said first slot group being positioned at intervals of equal or almost equal angles to the first pitch, said dummy slot portions and said winding slots in said second slot group being positioned at intervals of equal or almost equal angles to the first pitch, and the second pitch between adjacent winding slots of said first slot group and said second slot group being not equal to an integral multiple of said first pitch. It is preferable that the ratio of the second pitch to the first pitch is equal to 1 N M or 1 N M , where M is an integer not less than 2 and N is an integer not less than 1 and not equal to an integral multiple of M. It is also preferable that said armature core has at least a pair of short block and long block alternately positioned around said rotary shaft, that each of said short blocks has at least one short tooth and no long tooth, and that each of said long blocks has at least one long tooth and no short tooth, where each of the effective pitches of said short teeth is smaller than D 360 T degree, and each of the effective pitches of said long teeth is larger than D. It is also preferable that the number of said teeth in each of said short blocks is not less than the number of said teeth in each of said long blocks.
