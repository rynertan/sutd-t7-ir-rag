# LONG LIFE PORTABLE OXYGEN SENSOR WITH HIGH STABILITY

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor having increased stability in its sensitivity is provided. The oxygen sensor includes a sensing electrode spaced from a cadmium counter electrode. An alkaline electrolyte extends between the electrodes and permits the formation of cadmium hydroxide in the counter electrode as the cell is used. An electrical circuit connects the counter electrode and sensing electrode externally of the cell. The circuit includes a resistor and thermistor network and a voltmeter. Readings on the voltmeter can be calibrated to show the concentration of ambient oxygen diffusing a barium membrane to the sensor electrode.
