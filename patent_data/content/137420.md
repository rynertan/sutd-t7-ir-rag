# A METHOD FOR RAPID ACQUISITION OF NMR DATA

## Abstract
A method for rapid acquisition of NMR data utilizes excitation pulses which rotate the longitudinal magnetization through an angle smaller than 90 to create a relatively large transverse magnetization component. A first 180 RF pulse is then applied to create a spin echo signal, while a second 180 RF pulse is used to rapidly return to equilibrium the residual longitudinal magnetization inverted by the first pulse. The combination of the excitation and the second 180 pulses permits the sequence repetition time to be shortened, thereby reducing the total data collection time. The method is applicable to, for example, two and three dimensional embodiments of Fourier transform and multiple angle pro jection reconstruction NMR imaging methods.
