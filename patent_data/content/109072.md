## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A new Food and Drug Administration approved drug, Sucralfate, for the short term treatment of upper gastrointestinal ulcers has been proven to bind selectively to ulcerated areas in the upperG. I. tract. Several clinical trials have shown the safety and efficacy of Sucralfate in healing duodenal ulcers. Radiologic studies are preferred by many as the first diagnostic procedure when intestinal disease is suspected. They ar reasonably accurate in detecting ulcer disease in most instances.Radiologic studies are more widely available and are noninvasive, safer and less expensive then endoscopy, Applied Radiology, May June 1982, pp. 20 and 120. It is known that sucralfate binds to duodenal and gastric ulcers and to gastric erosions produced by ethanol and anti inflammatory drugs. The affinity of sucralfate for defective mucosa is explained by the drug s viscous adhesiveness and the formation of polyvalent bridges between the negatively charged sucralfate polyanions and positively charged proteins present in high concentrations in mucosal lesions. Sucralfate also buffers acid, inhibits the action of pepsin, and adsorbs bile salts.These properties of sucralfate enable the drug to act as an effective barrier to the penetration of acid, pepsin, and bile salts. Sucralfate also binds to uninjured mucosa to a much lesser extent and is believed to exert a similar barrier effect on regenerated and normal mucosa. Other possible mechanisms for sucralfate s antiulcer effect include depletion of acid, pepsin, and bile salts from the gastric secretion. Animal data show that the action of sucralfate is sustained because of its viscous adhesiveness, slow reaction with acid, and high affinity for areas with defectice mucosa, J. Clin. Gastroenterol 2 supp 2 117 127, 1981. 14 Studies involving labeled sucralfate in rats using histoautoradiographic methods have also been reported, DuodenalUlcer Gastric Ulcer, Sucralfate, a New Therapeutic Concept, edited by Wolfgang F. Caspary, Hanau, West Germany, published by Urban andSchwarzenberg, Munchen Wien Baltimore, 1981, pp 19 21. However, 14C labeled sucralfate is unsuited for in vivo imaging in humans. We have developed a simple method for labeling Sucralfate with Tc 99m and other radio labels. The resulting suspension is easily administered orally and imaging may be carried out with standard scintigraphic equipment. Preliminary animal and human studies show that the agent is stable in vivo and has clinical utility for the evaluation of gastrointestinal ulcer disease along with other diseases that are associated with loss of mucosal integrity The method is simple, should have ready patient accept ability and be associated with low radiation doses. It is believed that the present invention presents a significant advance in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the present invention comprises a novel diagnostic procedure for the in vivo clinical evaluation of gastrointestional ulcer disease and other diseases associated with loss of mucosal integrity in humans which comprises the oral administration of an effective amount of radiolabeled sucralfate or derivative thereof to the human host, followed by scintigrashic imaging of the gastrointestinal area of interest with scintigraphic imaging equipment. The invention further comprises radiolabeled sucralfate or derivative or precursors thereof wherein the radiolabel is one suitable for in vivo imaging in humans. The invention still further comprises a novel radiopharmaceutical composition of an aqueous suspension or s41utiqn containing an amount of a radiolabeled sucralfate or derivative or precursors thereof effective for in vivo scintigraphic imaging of the gastrointestinal tract and other muscosal areas in humans. It is an object of this invention to provide a new radioimaging technique for the in vivo detection of ulcers and related and associated diseases of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. It is also an object to provide an improved diagnostic technique useful for the detection of certain diseases in humans. A further object of this invention is to employ radiolabeled sucralfate or derivatives or precursors thereof in a novel diagnostic procedure. These and other objects and advantages of our invention will be apparent from the more detailed discussion which follows. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Technetium 99m labeled Sucralfate combines a short lived radioisotope which is most suitable for diagnostic imaging with a new oral medication which selectively binds to ulcers in the stomach and upper small bowel. This provides a safe, non invasive and benign way to detect, localize and access for the presence and the activity of ulcer disease in the upper GI tract, both for initial diagnosis and followed evaluation. The utility provided by our invention would replace or significantly decrease the need for the alternative methods of making a diagnosis which are relatively costly, less than adequately sensitive, often uncomfortable, and occasionally associated with significant risks. There are no published data describing the use of radiotracer labeled Sucralfate or any other ulcer avid agent for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal ulcer disease. The following Example is presented solely to illustrate the invention and should not be regarded as limiting in any way. EXAMPLE 1. 1 2 crushed Sucralfate tablets 1 gram Per tablet were suspended in HC1 at a pH of about 1 to 2. 2. 2 3 millicuries Technetium 99m labeled Human SerumAlbumin were combined with the Sucralfate in the presence of stannous tartrate. 3. The resultant compound was washed with deionized water. 4. The drug was then administered orally in the form of a suspension of the product in water. 5. The gastrointestinal area of the patient was then imaged with a gamma camera. Other modifications include tagging Sucralfate with other Technetium 99m compounds or other radioisotooe labels useful for imaging. For example, I131 can be used. Positron emitters can be used in lieu of gamma emitters. It is also intended to use other human or non human proteins or protein derivatives in place of human serum albumin to aid in radio labeling. The sucralfate can be replaced by derivatives thereof, preferably basic aluminum salts of a sulfated disaccaride, per se, a known class of compounds. The sucralfate can also be replaced by sucralfate precursors, for example, the sucrose moiety of sucralfate or related compounds, also a known class of chemical compounds. The sucralfate or derivative or precursor thereof is preferably labeled under acidic conditions with radiolabeled human serum albumin. However, amino acids, bovine albumin and other lower molecular weight proteins can also be used. The acidic conditions can be provided bv HC1 or any other mild acid. The stannous tartrate in the Example acts as a reducing agent and other reducing agents will be useful for this purpose. We anticipate based on our animal studies, that studies with this agent will be significantly more sensitive for the detection and localization, etc. of upper gastrointestinal ulcer disease than either of the only other two modalities available for this purpose, i.e., upper gastrointestinal barium x ray series or endoscopy. We have been able to clearly identify ulcers in rabbits as small as 1 mm in size. These are most unlikely to be detected by the currently used methods. Furthermore, it should be associated with only a possible minimal risk from radiation, albeit lower in general than with upper GI series. It will also likely involve the patient only in minimal degree of discomfort and psychological stress. Upper GI series and endoscopy are unpleasant, occasionally are associated with significant risk and or require ability for agile cooperation on the part of the patients. Initial studies in humans were conducted in three patients having confirmed ulcer disease. A one gram sucralfate tablet was first acidified and then labeled with 2 to 3 millicuriesTechnetium 99m labeled albumin and made into an aaueous suspensionA.small amount of an inert binder was also present. The acid was washed away leaving a slurry of fine particles which were then mixed with about 5cc of water and administered orally by swallowing. Imaging showed clearly that the labeled drug adhered selectively to the ulcerated portion of the mucosa. These areas were apparent. It is estimated that 10 of the U. S. population has upper gastrointestinal ulcer disease. Most of these patients will undergo either one or both of the presently available studies, i.e.endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal x rays repeatedly. In addition, a large number of patients who do not have ulcer disease undergo these examinations in order to rule such disease out. The radiolabel is present in an effective amount per dose which is usually on the order of .1 or 2 or more up to 10 millicuries or even more. Having fully described the invention, it is intended that it be limited only by the lawful scope of the amended claims.
