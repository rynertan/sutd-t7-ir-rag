# Control apparatus for operating a gas discharge lamp.

## Abstract
In a gas discharge lamp, when the current through the inductor 17 has increased to a point where the voltage drop across the resistor 15 exceeds the voltage of the reference source 23, 24 , the control device 949 carries the solid state switching device 14 to be turned off. This acts to collapose the magnetic field in the inductor 17 thereby causing a flyback voltage to appear across the lamp 11 . At the end of the predetermined time period of the low output state of the monostable multivibrator 18 , its output turns the solid state switching device 14 on, allowing current to flow from the power supply 16 through the inductor 17 and the lamp 11 , thereby maintaining the lamp in the lit state and increasing the magnetic field in the inductor 17 . The current flow through the lamp, when the solid state switching device 14 is on, is in the opposite direction from the current flowing through the lamp when the solid state switching device is off. To start the lamp 11 , an ignition pulse from a source 953 is induced in a secondary winding 952 of a transformer 950 in series with the lamp. The parallel combination of the diode 935 and the secondary winding 952 presents a low impedance after the lamp has started so that normal operation is not adversely affected.
