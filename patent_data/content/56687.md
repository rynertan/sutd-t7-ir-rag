# PLANTING AND NURTURE OF SEEDS

## Abstract
Seeds 18 are secured adjacent the upper edge of a strip 10, 16 of a bio degradable carrier element to the lower part of which is secured a quantity of a concentrated fertiliser 12. This strip is planted vertically in the soil, with the aid when necessary of pegs 22 to ensure verticality, and the soil is replaced to bury the seeds the required depth below the surface. The seeds are separated by a space from the fertiliser, and sound vertical root growth is promoted.
