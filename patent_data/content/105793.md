# Pressure compensated fuel injector.

## Abstract
A fuel injector 10 is fabricated from powdered metal or sintered iron technology and is modified to respond to variations in fuel pressure to maintain the flow output from the injector constant for a given pulse width regardless of the pressure of the source of fuel. Modifications are directed to variable lift of the valve member 30 from the valve seat 48 , variable pressure applied to the valve member 30 to hold the valve member on the valve seat 48 and an injector having the features of both variable lift and variable pressure.
