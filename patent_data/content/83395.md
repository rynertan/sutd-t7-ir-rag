# INDICATOR LOCATION DETERMINATION INTERFACE

## Abstract
An interface for determining the co ordinate location of a manually movable stylus 27 on a plane surface 26 comprises a a laser beam source 10 directed onto a rotating mirror scanner 12 behind the surface. The beam is reflect ed by the scanner along two dihedral mirrors 18, 19 at right angles and is reflected across the front of the surface to retroreflector strips 13, 15 at right angles, and back to a photodetector. The substantially constant photodetector current level is interrupted by the stylus 27 and the angular relationships derived from the timing of the interruptions. From these, the cartesian co ordinates are determined.
