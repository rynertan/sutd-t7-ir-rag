## Description
This invention generally relates to machines for instant profuction and distribution of so cailed ex resso icecream an more in articular, to a sealing means for the mixing delivering tae of said machines.As it is known, the machines for the production and distribution of expresso ice cream comprise one or more mixing cylinders, in each one of which ice cream of different taste is prepared. Said cylinders are connected to the outside y means of closing an delivering taps, formed by a piston slidinoly housed in a seat having a conjugate shape.Each piston is capable of closing and opening, by its axial motion under the control of a lever, a relevant delivering duct from the mixing cylinder concerned, through which the cloosen ice cream is delivered under pressure, in a known wayMoraover, between the delivering taps of two adjacent cylinders, a third piston tap is generally foreseen, which tap, through appropriate ducts, is connected with maid two ice cream prodacing cylindars. When said third tap is opened, a simultaneous delivery from the two cylinders of a tw11taste or mixed ice cream takes place. Said third tap is called mixing delivering tap. For sealing the piston taps, they are provided with two 13N rings pklaced, when the piston is in its closed postion, upstream and downstream the ice cream supplying opening of each mixing cylinder.This sealing system is sufficient and satisfactory for taps delivering one taste ice cream, in that said taps are in communication with one cact oniv, but i is a s utelv insufficient in the case of the abovestatei celivering tan, which communicates with two ducte suoolving ice cream of different taste. In facc, due to oressure differences occurring in the oroduction mixing cylinders during the use, ice tress infiltrations through the closec iston and its seat may happen from one mixing cylinder to the other, with the consequence that the one taste ice cream enters the cylinder of the other taste ice cream, thus jeooardizing the massane good ooeration.As a precise cou ling between the iston and its seat is very difficult, in order to eliminate said ice cream infiltrations, a s ecial sealing has already been ro osed. consisting of two axial soaced rings, such as those which are usually provided in the delivering taps, connected to one another in diemetrally oooosite ooints by two straight sealing seqments having such a length as to cover the diameter of the ooenings of the ice cream supolying ducts to the mixing delivering tes, said rings and said straight sealing saqments being housed in related grooves orovided for in the iston tap.Though solving the problem of preventing ice cream of one taste from seening into the duct or cylinder of ice cream of the other taste through the tap, said system has however the drawback of requiring d comples sealing element which needs a special manufacturing technique An object of the present invention is to eliminate this drawback by oroviding a sealing means for mixing delivering tans in machines for esaresso ice trean production and distribution, which avoids the above mentioned seepage of ice cream from one mixing cvlinder to the other, without using soecial sealing elements requiring an anpro riate manufacturing technique and therefore very expensive.More in particular, the invention relates to a sealing means for mixing delivering taps in machines for instant production and distribution of espresso ice cream, said tans being of the type comprising a cytlindrical niston sliding in a seat having a conjuqste shape and provided with two 0 rings placed, when the tap is closed, in said seat upstream nd downstream the outlet openings of ducts supplying ice cream of different tastes, said rings being housed in qrooves lying in planes perpendicular to the piston axis, characterized In that the Distan is provide with a third groove extending along an elliose as definet by the intersection of said piston with a plane lying between said O rincs perpendicular to the piston axis, and forming an angle to the piston axis such that, when said piston is in its closed position, each of the outlet openings of the ice cream feeding durts is completely positioned in each of the two half spaces generated by said plane, said groove being designed to receive a usual commercially available 0 ring.with said qiston confiquration it is therefore posible to solve in a simple way and using usual 0 rings, the probles of pneumatically separsting from one another the two ducts feeding ice cream of cifferent taste. zv samply placing the oiston its axlal sliding seat th t e elliosoit groove oriented in a way that the o site surfaces of said elliose are in front of the two ice cream suoolying ducts.In the accomoanying crawings figure 1 schematically shows a a mixing delfvering tap in machines for the orocurtion and distribution of expresse ice crea according to the invention, in its open positions figure 2 schamatirally stows the same tap, but in its open position figure 3 is a view, with detached dietes, of the dister according to the invention, partially in section, with the relevant rings and figure 4 shows the siston housed in its seat and in its closed position. The structure of a siston in a mixing delivering tap is more clearly seen in figures 3 and 4. The biston.generally shown by the reference 10, comorises a cylindrical bocy 11 showing on its too a rod 13 connected to a control lever for causing its opening and closure motions, said lever being positioned in front of the machine and being not shown in the drawing. The piston 10 resents at each ent of its cylindrical boby 11 grooves 14 and 15 which are formed in a plane perpendicular to the piston axis, usstream and downstream of the openings 16 and 17 of ducts 18 and 19, respectively, which supply ice cream to the tas.Each groove 14 and 15 houses an 0 ring, 20 and 21 resoectively, which provide a sealing at sach piston end to avoid that ice cream seeos out of the tan piston cylindrical seat 12. Scr far the tao has the usual structure of delivering tans for one taste ice tream. The characteristic of the piston according to the present invention is to provide, between said two grooves 14 and 15, a third groove 22 orovided in the side wall of cylindric piston 11, along an elliese defined by a planeP, intersecting said cylindrical body 11 of oiston 10 between grooves 14 and 15, with such an angle in respect to the piston axis n that, when the piston is in its closed position figure 4 , the plane P forms two halfspaces wherein the openings 16 and 17, resoectively, are completely contained.In other words, as shown in figure 4, the plane 8 passes upstream the opening 17 and downstream the opening 16 of dutts 19 and 18, respsctively, without touching said openings.This third groove 22 receives a usual commertially available 0 ring 23. Of course, the piston 10 must be positioned in its seat 12 with the ellipsoid groove 23 oriented in such a way that the opoosite surfaces of the ellipse are turned towards the relevant ducts 18 and 19 and said 0 ring 23 is placed as illustrated in the drawing It can be easily noticed that, when the piston 10 is in its closed position figures 2 and 4 , the ice cream of a first taste coming from duct 18 is sealingly separated fro ice eream of eiother tasse coming fres cu 19, means of said 0 ring 23, w c actualy sesa ates the two ice cres su iying cutts.When the con 10 is in its en eesition figure 1 , the tas delivers ice cream two different tastes, as shown by the arrows. The oroove 22 of ellipsoid shape can be easily provided in the piston side surface by using numerically controlled machine tools or can be even more easily obtained by molding, in case the piston is made of a suitable elastic material.From what above cescribed it can be easily noticed that a sealing means for a mixing celivering tes in a machine for the procurtion and cistr ution of sseresso ice cream has been obtaine , said means solving in an extremely simple way and with very reduces costs, the problem of separating in a perfecxt sealingly way the two ducts feeding ice creams of different tastes, thus avoiding infiltration of one type ice cream into the other one and, therefore, a unsatisfactory performance of the machine.
