# MOLDED POLYMER COMPOSITE

## Abstract
A composite for constructing an article 16 which is composed of a nonmetallic substance as represented by igneous rock 11, 12, 13 of different particle sizes which are compacted and then surrounded by a solidified plastic resin 14 . In a preferred manner, the igneous rock material 11, 12, 13 is a selected type of basalt with the basalt particles being of different mesh sizes to be compacted into a mold. After compaction, the plastic resin 14 as represented by an epoxy resin 14 is introduced into the mold so as to displace air from any voids surrounding the basalt particles 11, 12, 13 and to surround them with a resin 14 which later solidifies. A novel resin delivery system is also presented.
