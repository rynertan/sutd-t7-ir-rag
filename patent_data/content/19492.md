# Gas conditioning system, especially air conditioning system.

## Abstract
In a system primarily intended for aircraft air conditioning, air, after being compressed and cooled back to ambient temperature at 42 is cooled further in two heat exchangers 16, 14 . Condensed moisture is then seperated from the cold air at 18 , and the cold air then serves as the cooling medium in the first heat exchanger 16 . The air is then expanded in a turbine 22 , and cooled further in the process, and then serves as the cooling medium in the second heat exchanger 14 . A bypass passage 102 allows about one third of the cold air flow to by pass the second heat exchanger 14 the controlled reduction in the heat transfer resulting from this bypassing means that the air leaving the heat exchanger 14 for supply through 90 to a point of use will be appreciably lower in temperature than if no bypass were used. The bypass 102 may also reduce the tendency to icing in the heat exchanger 14 .
