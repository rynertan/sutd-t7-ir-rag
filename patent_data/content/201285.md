# Glass melting furnace.

## Abstract
A glass melting furnace 50, 150, 250, 350 is disclosed having a refractory melting vessel 60, 160, 260, 360, 460, 560 provided with a protective liner 70, 170, 270, 370, 470, 570 formed of an oxidizable refractory metal such as molybde num. The liner projects upwardly within a molten bath 80, 180 contained within the vessel and through its fusion line 78, 178, 278, 378, 478, 578 into a batch blanket 82, 182 retained thereabove which is low in carbonates. The upper end 71, 171, 271, 371 of the liner is provided with a seal to pre vent the flow of batch material between the liner and the refrac tory vessel and thereby prevent contamination of material be hind the liner and reduce corrosion of the refractory vessel.
