# An improved method of manufacturing flat panel backplanes, display transistors and displays made thereby.

## Abstract
An improved method of manufacturing active matrix display backplanes with thin film transistors thereon and a drive scheme therefor. A refractory metal covers the indium tin oxide ITO layer, patterned to form a gate electrode for the transistors and to protect the pixel pad ITO during forma tion of the transistors. To reduce shorts and capacitance between the gate and the source or the drain, an intermetal dielectric is patterned to form a central portion over a planar portion of the gate region and to cover any exposed gate edges.
