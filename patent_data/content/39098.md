# Process for convectively drying and if desired roasting and hushing polishing a granular free flowing bulk material and device for carrying out said process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process and a device for con vectively drying granular bulk material in a silo. A hot gas jet is vertically blown upward through a jet nozzle or jet aperture orifice , a tube having a wall closed over its entire length is inserted into the bulk material coaxially with the axis of the vertical gas jet, the tube being lowered up to a particular distance above the bottom of the silo, in such a way that continuously an amount of the descending bulk material is entrained by the recycling gas jet and is blown into the verti cally introduced upwardly directed jet of hot drying gas and the tube is of such a length that it projects with its top above the bulk material.
