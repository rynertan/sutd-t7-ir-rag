# Constant volume lithium battery cell and process.

## Abstract
A battery cell and a method for preparing a battery cell are disclosed in which a substantially fixed volume container includes the cell components therein in voltaic relationship, with the cell components including an anode comprising lithium metal, a non aqueous electrolyte and a cathode in a spatial relationship to the anode within the fixed volume container, wherein the cathode comprises cathode active material which upon discharge intercalates lithium and undergoes a phase transition to a distinct structural phase in which phase the cathode active material can reversibly operate and which phase provides a cathode expansion greater than the anode volume decrease upon discharge, and wherein the spatial relationship and the cathode expan sion within the substantially fixed volume are sufficient to produce a compressive load on the anode which inhibits the formation of a porous deposit of exterior, irregularly oriented, amalgamated lithium grains on the anode when the cell is reversibly operated with the cathode in said phase.
