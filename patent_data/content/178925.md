## Description
This invention relates to a dispenser. Current dispensers of, in particular, inhalable material in aerosol form, require the aerosol generating mechanism such as a nebulizer to operate in an inefficient mode and this results in different sized doses as the size of the dose depends upon how the generating mechanism is used. This is wasteful of the drug and the variability in dose size can result in under or over dosing. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a dispenser which will obviate or minimise the foregoing disadvantages in a simple yet effective manner, or which will at least provide the public with a useful choice. It is known from US 4109656 to provide a dispenser comprising a supply means to supply inhalable material in inhalable form, said supply means being in connection with atmosphere and a mouth piece, flow control means operable to allow or substantially prevent flow between said supply means and said mouth piece and detection means to detect the commencement of inspiration and or expiration and to cause said flow control means to cause or allow said inhalable material to move from said supply means to said mouth piece during a selected part of the period of inspiration which part of the period of inspiration is controlled by a control unit connected to the detection means. According to the present invention the dispenser is characterised in that the flow control means is operable to allow or substantially prevent flow between said supply means and said atmosphere and by further comprising signalling means controlled by the control unit and operable to indicate to the user when to inhale. To those skilled in the art to which the invention relates, many changes in construction and widely differing embodiments and applicatons of the invention will suggest themselves without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. The disclosures and the descriptions herein are purely illustrative and are not intended to be in any sense limiting. One preferred form of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig.1 is a diagrammatic layout of a dispenser according to one preferred form of the invention Fig.2 is a simplified circuit block diagram of a control unit with the dispenser of Fig.1 Fig.3 is a layout as for Fig.1 of an alternative form of the invention Fig.4 is a circuit block diagram of a control unit as for Fig.2 for the dispenser of Fig.3. Referring to the drawings, a dispenser and or a method of dispensing are provided as follows. The dispenser of Fig.1 comprises a supply means to supply inhalable material in inhalable form. This may be, in particular, any known type of aerosol generator or aerosol propellant such as a nebulizer 1. The aerosol may be processed by baffles to remove particles above a selected size and particles removed may be fed back into the nebulizer 1. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a conduit 2 is provided from the nebulizer 1 to a mouth or nose piece 3 and the conduit 2 may lead from a cloud chamber or aerosol reservoir 4. Thus, particles produced by the nebulizer 1 may pass through the reservoir 4 along the conduit 2 to the mouth piece 3. A pair of branch conduits 5 and 6 may lead from the conduit 2, the conduit 5 allowing air to be inhaled and the conduit 6 allowing air to be exhaled. A conduit 7 extends from the chamber 4. Flow control means are provided in each conduit and thus, a valve 8 is provided in conduit 7, a valve 9 in conduit 5 and a valve 10 in conduit 6. Associated with each valve 8, 9 and 10 is a non return valve 11, 12 and 13 directed to allow air flow in only the desired direction. The valves 8, 9 and 10 are desirably electrically operated comprising, for example, solenoid valves. Detecting means are provided to detect air flow at least in the conduits 6 and 7. Thus, a detector l4 is provided in conduit 7 and a detector 15 in conduit 6. Each detector 14 and 15 preferably comprises a bobbin 17 which may be biased, for example, by a spring 16 which bobbin 17 moves in the conduit in response to air movement in that conduit. The movement may be detected desirably electronically, for example, by interruption of a light beam across the conduit or relatively by some other means. As alternatives, the detectors 14 and 15 could comprise thermocouples or thermistors with a sensing circuit or a device to measure increased or decreased pressure relative to atmosphere at some point connected to the mouth piece 3. The nebulizer 1 may, if required, be provided with a power source 20, for example, electrical or pneumatic or otherwise as required and the power source 20 may be turned on by a control unit 21. A compressed air nebulizer must be turned on and off now and then, although this is not so important when ultrasonic nebulizer is used. This turning on may be, for example, at the start of inhalation through mouth piece 3 or at some time after this and may be turned off on the opening of the valve 8 if desired to enable a rest to be taken at the start of the inhalation signals. Turning the production of aerosol on and off during breathing could also reduce the dose of drug given per breath and this would allow more breaths to be taken for a given dose and thereby achieve greater precision of doseage. A counter 22 may be provided to keep a count of the number of breaths taken and this may be pre settable so that, for example, an alarm sounds or the dispenser stops delivering aerosol after the required number of breaths have been taken. The counter may begin incrementing when the start of the inhalation is detected. A power on pulse circuit 23 is provided and when the dispenser is turned on a signal is forwarded from power on pulse circuit 23 and signal circuitry 24 indicates by visual or audio means that a breath should be taken by the user. The valves 9 and 10 are closed and valve 8 is opened. This allows inhalation of aerosol formed by the nebulizer 1 in the reservoir 4 by the drawing of breath through the inlet port 25. The state of breathing is detreated and, for example, when the start of inhalation is detected by the detecting means comprising the flow sensor 14, timer 26 begins and after a present delay the valve 8 is closed. At this time, timer 27 is started and valve 9 is opened about this time and this, together with the non return valve 12, allows inhalation of air through the inlet 28. After timer 27 has run for its present time, valve 9 is closed and the inhale signals at 24 are turned off. The exhale signals at 35 are then turned on and valve 10 is opened which, together with the non return valve 13, allows exhalation through the outlet port 29. When the start of exhalation is detected by the flow sensor 15, timer 30 is started and after this has run for its present time, the valve 10 is closed and the exhale signals from generator 35 are turned off. The inhale signals from generator 24 are then turned on and the valve 8 opens to restart the cycle when inhalation occurs. In the embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4, a compressed air nebulizer is used, which is able to be switched on and off and the intermittent nature of the operation allows selection of the running period to achieve a desired result. A conduit 2 is provided from the nebulizer 1 to a mouth piece 3 and the conduit 2 may lead from a cloud chamber or aerosol reservoir 4. Thus, particles produced by the nebulizer 1 may pass through the reservoir 4 along the conduit 2 to the mouth piece 3. A branch conduit leads from the conduit 2 which allows air to be exhaled. A conduit 7 extends from the chamber 4. Non return valves 11 and 13 allow air flow in only the desired direction. Detecting means are provided to detect air flow at least in the conduits 6 and 7. Thus, a detector 14 is provided in conduit 6 and a detector 15 in conduit 7. Each detector 14 and 15 preferably comprise a bobbin 17 which may be biased, for example, by a spring 16 which bobbin 17 moves in the conduit in response to air movement in that conduit. The movement may be detected desirably electronically, for example, by interruption of a light beam across the conduit or relatively by some other means. As alternatives, the detectors 14 and 15 could comprise thermocouples or thermistors with a sensing circuit or a device to measure an increased or decreased pressure relative to atmosphere at some point connected to the mouth piece 3. The nebulizer 1 may, if required, be provided with a power source 20, for example, electrical or pneumatic or otherwise as required, and the power source 20 may be turned on by a control unit 21. This turning on may be, for example, at the start of exhalation through mouth piece 3 or at some time after this and may be turned off at some time after this. Again, a counter 22 may be provided to keep a count of the number of breaths taken and this may be pre settable so that, for example, an alarm sounds or the dispenser stops delivering aerosol after the required number of breaths have been taken. The counter may begin incrementing when the start of the inhalation is detected. A power on pulse circuit is provided and when the dispenser is turned on a signal is forwarded from power on pulse circuit 23 and signal circuitry 35 indicates by visual or audio means that a breath should be taken by the user. This allows inhalation of aerosol formed by the nebulizer 1 in the reservoir 4 by the drawing of breath through the inlet port 25. When the start of inhalation is detected by the detecting means comprising the flow sensor 15, timer 30 begins. After 30 has run for its pre set time the exhale signals at 24 are then turned on, which indicates that the user should exhale and signals at 35 are turned off. When the start of exhalation is detected by the lower sensor 14, timer 26 and timer 27 are started. After timer 27 has run for its present time the aerosol generator is turned on. After timer 26 has run for its pre set time, the aerosol generator is turned off and signals at 24 are turned off and signals at 35 turned on. When inhalation occurs, the timer 30 is started to repeat cycle. In use, the nebulizer 1 can be used to generate an aerosol of material such as insulin but which clearly could comprise other materials such as, for example, drugs for use in the treatment of asthmatic conditions. The drug used may dictate whether a compressed air or ultrasonic nebulizer is used. Thus, it can be seen that at least in the preferred form of the invention, a dispenser and or a method of dispensing are provided which have the advantage that the drug in aerosol form is released at that stage of the breath cycle where it is most efficaceous and is withheld at other times. In general, this will be at the beginning of the inhalation of the breathing cycle and the invention has been described in relation to such a construction. The provision of signals to which the user matches his breathing also tends to ensure that the breath is held for a sufficient time for the aerosol particles to settle in the lungs. The rate of breathing may also be controlled and, in particular, decreased resulting in deeper breathing and thereby increased deposition of the aerosol particles in the lower lung.
