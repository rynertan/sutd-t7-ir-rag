# Method of melting vitreous materials and use of the suitable device for the accomplishment of the method.

## Abstract
Method of melting vitreous materials, in which the ther mal power to be supplied electrically to the vitreous mass is controlled by supplying the melting plant with the maximum electric power, for which the plant is rated, during pre established intervals of time, spaced by pre established inter vals of time during which no electric power is applied. The length of said intervals of time is equivalent to an entire number of cycles of the alternating voltage applied to the plant. The power control is obtained by changing the length of said intervals of time by means of a device suitable for realis ing a pre established sequence of conduction and non conduction intervals of the electric power circuit of the melt ing plant.
