An arrangement in a resaw feeding device comprising two roller boxes 12 located opposite each other and which are displaceably mounted towards and away from each other in the frame 11 of the feeding device and each supporting a number of, preferably three, feed rollers 13,14,15 intended to bear against opposite sides of a log 17 for feeding it towards a sawing member 10 . The object of the invention is to provide a device which in one position provides a separate and possibly progressive resilience of the feed rollers and which in another position provides locking of the feed rollers, which is desired at for example eccentric sawing of the log, when the feed rollers of one side should make the stopside. Another object is to provide a device which on one hand enables a simple and quick adjustment between centric and eccentric sawing and on the other hand that both the sawing methods guarantees that the sawing is performed in the intended longitudinal plane. These objects have been solved by the fact that each feed roller 13,14,15 is resiliently pivoted about an axle 18,19,20 each relative to the respective roller box 12 .

## Description
An arrangement in a resaw feeding deviceTechnical fieldThe present invention refers to an arrangement in a resaw feeding device comprising two roller boxes located opposite each other and which are displaceably mounted towards and away from each other in the frame of the feeding device and each supporting a number of, preferably three, feed rollers intended to bear against opposite sides of a log for feeding it towards a sawing member.Background of the inventionAt prior feeding devices of this kind the feed rollers are rigidly attached in the roller boxes. This means that the whole roller box has to resiliently move aside at the passage of irregular logs. If for example a thicker log would follow a thinner one the feed rollers lose contact with the thinner log and it will be sawed without a correct guidance. Further warped logs will winde themselves to the feeding device instead of be positioned, and thus the sawed wood will be correspondingly warped.Summary and advantages of the inventionThe object of the invention is to provide a device solving the above mentioned problems and which in one position provides a separate and possibly progressive resilience of the feed rollers and which in another position provides locking of the feed rollers, which is desired for example when the log is eccentricely sawed, when the feed rollers of one side should form a stop. Another object is to provide a device which enables a simple and quick switching over from centric to eccentric sawing and which at both these sawing methods guarantees that the sawing is performed in the intended longitudinal plane of the log.These objects have been solved by the fact that each feed roller is resiliently pivoted about an axle each relative to the respective roller box. Further it is preferred that a locking device is arranged in each roller box for locking the pivotal movement of the feed rollers.Description of the drawingsThe invention will now be closer described with reference to a pair of embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a schematic view from above of a feeding device with a log shown in feeding position.Fig. 2 is a partly broken side view of a roller box.Fig. 3 is a section according to the line III III in Fig. 2.Fig. 4 is a partly broken top view of a roller box showing the transmission device for the feed rollers.Fig. 5 is a partly end view of a roller box.Fig. 6 shows on a larger scale a view from above of the feed roller pair closest to the saw blade and showing the bearing means and a centering device connected therewith.Fig. 7 is a side view on a further enlarged scale of a coupling lever contained in the centering device, andFig. 8 is a partly cut side view of one or two sleeves rotatably mounted at the coupling lever.Description of embodimentsThe feeding device shown in Fig. 1 is arranged in front of the saw blade 10 to a band saw or circular saw not further shown in the drawings. Two roller boxes 12 which each supports for example three feed rollers 13, 14 and 15 are mounted in the frame 11 of the feeding device on both sides of the vertical center plane of the saw blade 10, said roller boxes being displaceable towards and away from each other. The roller boxes 12 are individually adjustable towards and away from the vertical center plane of the saw blade means of a screw spindel 16 each.In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 the roller boxes 12 are adjusted for centric sawing of a log denoted with the numeral 17, said log being forwarded towards the saw blade 10 of the feed rollers 13, 14 and 15, which in pairs bear against opposite side of the log. The feed rollers 13, 14 and 15 are individually resiliently pivoted about an axle 18, 19 and 20 each. Each of the rotation axle 7 9 of the feed rollers are mounted in a lever 24, which is pivoted about the respective axle 18, 19 and 20. From each lever 24 a side arm projects, which acts upon a pneumatic pressure cell 21 each, which in the embodiment shown provides the resilient element which determines the bearing pressure. The roller boxes 12 are fixed during operation and it is only the feed rollers which moves relative to the irregularities of the log. Thus the feed rollers all the time have contact with the log.The feed rollers are by way of a cog wheel transmission 33 driven by a hydralic motor 22. The cog wheel transmission 33 arranged in the upper part of the roller box 12 is shown in Fig. 4. The driving wheel of the hydralic motor 22 is denoted with the numeral 23.At eccentric sawing, i.e. sawing on a certain distance from one side of the log, the three feed rollers 13, 14 and 15 are locked on the side that should be the stop side while the rollers on the opposite side are freely resilient. the locking device comprises a bar 27 rotatably mounted in the lower part of the roller box 12, said bar extending in the longitudinal direction of the roller box. The bar 27 is rotated by means of a pneumatic or hydralic cylinder 28 rotatably attached to the roller box 12 and the piston rod 29 of which acts upon a bracket 30. From the lever 24 of each feed roller 13, 14 and 15 a locking arm 31 projects which is locked in a recess in the bar 27 when this is folded down. In this way the resilience of all the feed rollers of one side are simultaneously locked. When the bar 27 is in its upper position as is shown in Fig. 5 the feed rollers are freely resilient.Adjusting screws 32 are arranged at the locking arms 31 for adjusting these and by that the feed rollers in the desired position. Locking devices can be arranged in both the right and the left roller box or only in one. The switching over of the locking device between inactive and active position is preferably remote controlled. The feed roller pair 15 located nearest to the saw blade 10 is interconnectable by means of a hydraulic operated centering device 26, in order to provide a symmetric movement of these two rollers at centric sawing of the log 17.Each of the feed rollers 15 located nearest the saw blade 10 is rotatable about an axle 9 according to Fig. 6, which is supported by the one arm 34 of a two armed lever 35, which by means of an axle 36 is rotably mounted in the roller box 12. Two rods 37 are each with one end fixed to an attachment means 38, which is rotatably mounted at the free end of the opposite arm 40 of the lever 35 about an axle 39. Both rods 37 are passed through a locking sleeve 41 each, said sleeves being rotatably mounted at opposite ends of a two armed coupling bar 42, which is pivoted about an axle 43 in a bracket 44 fixed in the frame of the feeding device. To one arm of the coupling bar 42 there is coupled one end of a draw spring 45, the opposite end of which is connected to the frame at 46. According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 7 the coupling bar 42 is composed by an upper portion 42a and a lower portion 42b, which at the ends are connected by means of plates 47 and between which the both locking sleeves 41 are mounted by means of upper and lower shaft pivot 48 and 49 respectively.As can be seen from Fig. 8 the locking sleeve 41 is on its inside provided with a cylinder shaped reset 50, which is sealingly closed by a comparetively thin walled inner sleeve 52, which is connected to the sleeve by means of weld joints 51. The ring shaped room formed by the recess 50 communicates with a passage 53 through the pivot shaft 59 and which is connected to a feed conduit for pressure medium 53. The different parts are so dimensioned that the rod 37 is freely displaceable in the sleeve in its longitudinal direction as long as the ringshaped space 50 its not under pressure, while a supply of pressure medium to trwe space 50 results in that the inner sleeve 52 is curved inwards so that it is pressed against and locked to the rod 50.When both sleeves 41 are locked to the respective rod 37 a movement of one of the rollers 15 towards or away from the log 17 will be transferred to a corresponding movement of the opposite feed roller 4 by means of the above described device. When one of the locking sleeves 41 are released from its rod 37 the rod is freely displaceable in the sleeve and does not actuate the coupling bar 42. Releasment of both locking sleeves 41 from the rods 37 enables adjustment of the roller boxes towards or away from the sawing plane, at which the coupling bar 42 by means of the spring 45 is kept in the position shown in Fig. 6 for providing a correct initial position of the lever, when the sleeves are relocked to the rods.Each of the levers 35 supporting the feed rollers 15 is provided with a side arm 25, which is acutuated by the pneumatic pressure cell 21 which is mounted in the frame and which keeps the roller 15 resiliently bearing against the log.At centric sawing the device functions and is used in the following way.With both locking sleeves 41 released from the rod 37 the roller boxes 12 are adjusted by means of the screw spindles 16 on an equal distance from the sawing plane with an inter space corresponding to the width of the log. Then the locking sleeves 41 are locked to the respective rods by putting the recesses 50 under pressure in the manner described above. By the fact that the levers 35 supporting the feed rollers 15 are interconnected by way of the attachment means 38, the rods 37, the sleeves 41 and the coupling bar 42 variations in width of the log will result in equal movements of the two rollers 15, so that the log is all the time centered relative to the saw blade. With the center means 26 engaged a resilient movement of the right feed roller 15 a certain distance the left feed roller will resiliently move in the opposite direction a corresponding distance, so that the log is all the time sawed in the middle irrespective of variations in width thereof. By the fact that the pressure cells have been chosen as spring elements to all the feed rollers the two other freely resilient roller pair 13 and 14 will also have a similar effect. If for example the first right feed roller 13 will resiliently move a certain distance the pressure of the pressure cell 21 on the feed roller 13 will increase. That will also actuate the opposite roller 13 in the opposite direction and the roller pair is thus all the time striving to guide the log towards the middle.The pressure to each pressure cell 21 of each feed roller is preferably adjustable by means of a pressure regulator which is not shown. The adjusted pressure should be red on a pressure gauge.It should be pointed out that the last feed roller pair 15 with its centre is located just opposite the teeth of the saw blade 10, at which is guaranteed that every single log 15 guided during the whole sawing operation and tailing is avoided, i.e. that the last phase of the sawing is not correct to size.The invention is of course not limited to the embodiment shown but can be varied within the scope of the claims.
