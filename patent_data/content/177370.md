## Description
PROCESS FOR PHOSPHAZENE TRIMER PURIFICATION High molecular weight linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymers are used to make a broad range of useful polyphosphazenes by substitution of the chlorine atoms with various groups such as phenoxide, alkylphenoxide, fluoroalkoxide and the like. These polyphosphazenes can be used to make articles such as foam insulation, o rings, hydraulic seals, wire and cable insulation, hose liners and the like. The high molecular weight linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymers used to make the various substituted polyphosphazenes can be made by the thermal polymerization of cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer preferably using a catalyst as described in U.S. 4,123,503 and U.S. 4,226,840. Not all trimer can be successfully polymerized to form a linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride.Early attempts at the thermal polymerization of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer lead to the formation of hard, cross linked polymers that were OL little use. The secret to obtaining linear polymers rather than the hard, cross linked polymers was found to be related to the purity of the phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. Various methods have been tried to purify trimer to obtain trimer that could be successfully polymerized to high molecular weight linear polymers. Such purified trimers are referred to herein as polymerization grade trimer . Various purification methods are described in U.S. 3,008,799 U.S. 3,378,353 U.S. 3,379,510t U.S. 3,677,720 U.S. 3,694,171 U.S. 3,952,086 U.S. 4,175,113 and GB 2,114,111. It has now been discovered that polymerization grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer can be consistently obtained from crude trimer by forming a solution of the crude trimer in a solvent such as monochlorobenzene, heating the solution to distill off solvent forming a concentrate, cooling the concentrate to precipitate trimer, separating the precipitated trimer from the solvent phase and distilling the separated precipitate to obtain polymerization grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. A modification of the foregoing procedure involves either adding water to the crude trimer concentrate or washing the initial crude trimer solution with water before the concentrating step. In either case, the solution is then cooled to precipitate the trimer which is then separated and subsequently distilled to obtain the polymerization grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. One embodiment of the invention is a process for purifying impure cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer to obtain polymerization grade trimer, said process comprising a forming a hot solution of impure phos phonitrilic chloride trimer, b cooling said hot solution to form a crystalline precipitate, c separating said crystalline precipitate from the liquid solvent phase and d distilling the separated crystalline pre cipitate to obtain said polymerization grade trimer. Solvents which can be used include any inert liquid which will dissolve the crude trimer when hot e.g. 50 100 C but precipitate the trimer content when cooled e.g. 10 to 30 C . These include toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane, octane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, l,l,l trichloroethane, perchloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, chlorotoluene, dichlorotoluene, chlorobromobenzene and the like including mixtures thereof. Of these the more preferred solvents are the halogenated benzenes such as monochlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, monobromobenzene, dibromobenzene, chlorobromobenzene and the like including mixtures thereof. The most preferred solvent is monochlorobenzene. The initial trimer solution can be made by merely dissolving the impure phosphonitrilic chloride trimer in an appropriate solvent. The initial solution should include sufficient solvent to maintain the crude trimer including impurities in solution at elevated temperatures. The crude trimer contains impurities such as higher cyclics including tetramer, pentamer and the like as well as some oligomeric products. Generally, the initial solution contains in excess of 50 weight percent solvent and preferably in excess of 70 weight percent solvent and 5 30 weight percent crude phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. Any solids that remain undissolved should be removed by filtration. The solution is then heated to distill off a portion of the solvent to form a hot concentrate. The distillation can be conducted at atmospheric pressure or at reduced pressure. Preferably vacuum is applied to moderate the temperature in the re boiler. Frequently it is not necessary to apply vacuum at the start of the solvent distillation but towards the end of the distillation vacuum is applied to keep the temperature of the residual concentrate from exceeding 200 C and preferably below 175 C and most preferably below 1500C. The distillation is continued until the residual hot concentrate has a trimer concentration which will cause precipitation of trimer upon cooling of the concentrate to temperatures in the range of 10 to 40 C and preferably upon cooling to ambient temperature.Preferably the hot concentrate will contain less than 50 weight percent solvent and more preferably less than 40 weight percent solvent. Using monochlorobenzene as the solvent, good precipitation has been achieved with a concentrate containing 25 40 weight percent monochlorobenzene and the balance crude trimer. The hot concentrate is then allowed to cool to a temperature such that a substantial portion of the dissolved trimer precipitates. Preferably at least 50 weight percent and more preferably at least 60 weight percent of the dissolved trimer is precipitated on cooling. The cooled concentrate can be at temperatures ranging from 100C or lower up to 400C. Preferably the cooled concentrate is near ambient temperature, e.g. 20 300C. The precipitated crystalline trimer is then separated from the solvent phase. This can be done by conventional means such as filtration or centrifugation.Filtration has been used in development work. It is then Preferred kash the separated precipitate with an ali phatic hydrocarbon that can be easily removed from the precipitate by evaporation or during the initial portion of the subsequent distillation. Aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling temperature of 50 150iC, more preferably 60 900C can be used. Some examples are hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ethers and the like including mixtures thereof. Alternatively cold monochlorobenzene or other halogenated solvents can be used. The crystalline trimer is next placed in a distillation vessel. It is preferred that the trimer be handled under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere. The distillation apparatus need not be a multi plate rectification column. A simple distillation unit is adequate although a multi plate distillation unit can be used. The trimer is heated above its melting point appx. 115 C to melt the trimer. Preferably vacuum is applied while heating to assist in removal of residual solvents. The molten trimer is then heated to 130 200 C, more preferably 150 1750C and the pressure is reduced until distillation occurs. Generally the pressure will be in the range of 10 600 mm Hg absolute depending on temperature. Excellent results have been achieved at a reduced pressure of 6 40 Torr at a liquid temperature range of 140 220 C from the start to the finish of the distillation. Preferably a forecut is removed which contains low boiling impurities. The amount of forecut removed can be 0.1 weight percent or more of the crystalline precipitate charged to the distillation vessel. More preferably the forecut is at least 1.0 weight percent of the distillation charge. There is no real upper limit but excessive forecut removal will lower the recovery of purified trimer and thus be uneconomical. A good range to operate in is to remove 1 10 weight percent of the precipitated trimer charged to the distillation as a forecut. After the forecut is removed and segregated, a middle cut or heart cut is distilled over which represents the polymerization grade trimer. Distillation of the heart cut can be continued until the re boiler liquid temperature approaches temperatures which cause decomposition or polymerization or until no further trimer distills over at the temperature pressure conditions at which the main portion of the trimer distilled. It is preferred that the re boiler liquid should not exceed 200or. A beneficial modification in the foregoing procedure involves the use of water to increase the volume of the liquid phase so as to permit easier stirring and handling of the trimer slurry. Since the trimer is insoluble in the water, this does not result in any increase in the amount of trimer remaining in the solution. Water will also serve to extract any waterinsoluble impurities into the water phase. This can be done by either adding water to the hot concentrate, i.e., after the initial solvent solution is heated to remove a portion of the solvent, or water can be added to the initial crude trimer solution in the solvent to in effect wash the solution. If water is added to the hot concentrate, the amount should be 0.1 to 20 times the volume of the hot concentrate itself.If the water is added to the initial crude trimer solution, the amount can vary but generally should be between 10 to 1000 volume percent of the crude trimer solution. A more practical range is 50 to 100 volume percent of the trimer solution. after the water addition to the crude trimer solution to wash the solution, the solution is agitated at either room or elevated temperatures up to 900C. A highly preferred way to obtain the initial crude cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer solution is to make the crude trimer in the same solvent used for crystallization. Thus, a highly preferred embodiment of the invention is a process for making polymerization grade cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer, said process comprising a reacting ammonium chloride with phosphorus pentachloride in an inert solvent at 100 1600C to form a solution of impure phosphonitrilic chloride trimer, b distilling a portion of said solvent from said solution to obtain a hot concentrate containing less than 50 weight percent solvent, c cooling said hot concentrate to form a precipitate of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer, d separating said precipitate from the solvent phase and e distilling said precipitate to recover polymerization grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. In a still more preferred embodiment step e is conducted by first removing a small forecut of 0.1 10 weight percent of the precipitate, more preferably 0.5 5 weight percent of the precipitate and then continuing the distillation to remove a heart cut of polymerization grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer. Examples of solvents have been listed previously.The preferred solvents are the same halogenated benzenes such as monochlorobenzene, monobromobenzene, dichlorobenzene, chlorobromobenzene and the like including mixtures thereof. The most preferred solvent is monochlorobenzene. The crude tritnr is made by the known procedure of reacting ammonium chloride and phosphorus pentachloride in a solvent. Instead of ammonium chloride it is possible to use the combination of NH3 and HC1 which is equivalent to NH4C1. Likewise, the combination of PC13 and C12 can be used as the equivalent of Pal5. In making the phosphonitrilic chloride cyclic trimer, the stoichiometric mole ratio is 1 1. However, in order to maximize formation of cyclics it is preferred to use a slight excess of NH4C1. A useful reactant ratio is 1 1.5 moles of NH4C1 per mole of PC15. A more preferred ratio is 1.05 1.25 1.0. Preferably the reaction is conducted by slowly adding the PCl5 to the NH4C1 slurried in the reaction solvent over a 4 hour period at reaction temperature of 100 160 C. The amount of solvent should be such that the resultant reaction mixture contains more than 50 weight percent solvent, more preferably in excess of 60 weight percent solvent and most preferably 70 95 weight percent solvent. Following the addition of the PC15, the mixture of NH4C1 and PCl5 in the solvent e.g. monochlorobenzene is stirred at reaction temperature for a period sufficient to form a substantial amount of cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride. A useful reaction temperature is lO0 160 ole preferably 110 150 C and most preferably l20 l40C. In some cases a pressure system will be required to achieve the higher temperature because of the solvent boiling point. For example, monochlorobenzene boils at 132µC at atmospheric pressure 80 above atmospheric pressure would be required to exceed this temperature. However good yields of cyclic phosphonitrilic chlorides high in trimer can be achieved in monochlorobenzene at temperatures of 120 130 C so use of a pressure reactor is not required.Also conducting the reaction in a refluxinq solvent makes temperature control much easier. The reaction to form the crude trimer solution from NH4C1 and PCl5 is usually complete in 3 5 hours including PCl5 addition time and post addition cook depending upon reaction temperature. At a reaction temperature of 125 C the reaction is complete in about 5 hours. Following the formation of the initial solution of crude trimer there is generally some unreacted NH4C1 remaining. This should be removed at this stage and this removal can conveniently be accomplished by the use of water as previously described. Water, whether used to wash the initial crude trimer solution or added to the hot concentrate, will extract the NH4C1 into the water phase. The precipitation from the hot concentrate and dist tion of the precipitate is likewise conducted as previously described. The following examples serve to show how the process is conducted. EXAMPLE 1 In a reaction vessel was placed 9787 ml monochlorobenzene and 802.5 grams of finely divided NH4C1.Over a 5 hour period 2496 grams of PC15 in 5600 ml monochlorobenzene was added to the stirred mixture at 124 C. Stirring was continued at reaction temperature for an additional hour. The resultant solution was then filtered. The filtrate was then concentrated by distilling off monochlqrobenzene under vacuum. Final solvent distillation conditions were about 850C at 10Torr re boiler liquid temperature. The resultant concentrate contained about 32 weight percent monochlorobenzene and the remainder was the crude trimer.The hot concentrate was allowed to cool to room temperature and then further cooled to 10 C forming a crystalline precipitate. The precipitate was recovered by filtration under nitrogen and washed with cold heptane. The precipitate 206 grams was then placed in a round bottom flask fitted with a distillation head.The precipitate was heated while 20 inches Hg vacuum was appJ.ied. Heating was continued up to a flask temperature of 158 C while pressure was gradually reduced to 40Torr. During this stage a forecut was distilled out amounting to 20.3 grams. Following removal of the forecut, a heart cut 157 grams was distilled at 100 137 overhead at 15 Torr. During the distillation the re boiler reached a maximum temperature of 178 C. 31The heart cut analyzed by P NMR as 98.37 weight percent cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer and 1.63 weight percent tetramer. Polymerization The above polymer grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer 30 g was placed in a clean glass ampule together with 36 mg of triphenyl phosphate BC13 complex cfU.S. 4,226,840 . The ampule was sealed under vacuum and heated at 220it for 10 hours. The ampule was then cooled and broken and the polymer was dissolved in a cyclohexane. At this stage the solution was analyzed by 31P tER to determine the conversion of trimer to linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride. The linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride was then coagulated by adding heptane in an amount twice as much as the cyclohexane. The solvent was decanted and the coagulate was washed with heptane and decanted. The coagulate was then dissolved in 150 ml toluene and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum oven.The LVN in deciliters gram, dl g limiting viscosity number was determined on a solution of 0.33 g polymer in 100 ml toluene containing 0.5 weight percent tri n octylamine using an Ubbelohde Viscosimeter. TheLVN is a measure of molecular weight. Preferred linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymers have an LVN of 0.8 1.75, more preferably 1.0 1.5. The linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride had a light color and an LVN of 1.3 dl g. EXAMPLE 2 This reaction was conducted in the same manner asExample 1 except that the hot concentrate was only cooled to room temperature for precipitation. The purified cyclic phosphonitriLic chloride analyzed 99.75 weight percent trimer and 0.25 weight percent tetramer. The conversion to a high molecular weight LvN 1.5 dl g gel free polymer was 64 . EXAMPLE 3 This reaction was conducted in the same manner asExample 2 except the reaction temperature in the trimer synthesis step was 130 C and the polymerization time was 16 hours. The purified cyclic trimer analyzed 99.92 weight percent trimer and 0.08 weight percent tetramer.Conversion to a gel free colorless linear high molecular weight LVN 1.0 phosphonitrilic chloride polymer was 68 . The following Examples 4 6 serve to show how the process is conducted using the modification of adding water to the hot concentrate. EXAMPLE 4 In a reactiom vessel was placed 10845 ml monochlorobenzene and sufficient NH3 and HC1 were injected to form 834.6 grams of finely divided NH4. Over a 3.8 hour period 2500 grams of PC15 in 5600 ml monochlorobenzene was added to the stirred mixture at 1290 C. Stirring was continued at reaction temperature for an additional hour. The resultant solution was then filtered. The filtrate was then concentrated by distilling off monochlorobenzene under vacuum up to a 85 C re boiler liquid temperature. The resultant concentrate contained about 32 weight percent monochlorobenzene and the remainder was the crude trimer. At this stage 547 ml of water was added to the hot concentrate while stirring and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature while stirring. The trimer precipitated forming a slurry. The trimer precipitate was separated from the slurry by filtration, washed with water and dried. The dried precipitate 81 grams was then placed in a round bottom flask fitted with a distillation head. The precipitate was heated while 20 inches Hg vacuum was applied.Heating was continued up to a flask temperature of about 1300C while pressure was gradually reduced to about 15 Torr. During this stage a small foreciilt. was distilled Following removal of the foreut, a heart cut was distilled at 130 1400C overhead at 16Torr. During the distillation the re boiler reached a maximum temperature of about 170 C. The heart cut was analyzed by P NMR as 99.6 weight percent cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride trimer and 0.4 weight percent tetramer. Polymerization The above polymer grade phosphonitrilic chloride trimer 30 g was placed in a clean glass ampule together with 36 mg of triphenyl phosphate BC13 complex cfU.S. 4,226,840 . The ampule was sealed under vacuum and heated at 2200C for 10 hours. The ampule was then cooled and broken and the polymer was dissolved in a cyclohexane. At this stage the solution was analyzed by 31P NMR to determine the conversion of trimer to linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride. The linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride was then coagulated by adding heptane in an amount twice as much as the cyclohexane. The solvent was decanted and the coagulate was washed with heptane and decanted. The coagulate was then dissolved in 150 ml toluene and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum oven. The LVN limiting viscosity number was determined on a solution of 0.33 g polymer in 100 ml toluene containing 0.5 weight percent tri n octylamine using an Ubbelohde Viscosimeter. The LVN is a measure of molecular weight. Preferred linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymers have an LVN of 0.8 1.75, more preferably 1.0 1.5. The dried linear polyphosphonitrilic chloride had a light color and an LVN of 2.3. EXAMPLE 5 This reaction was conducted in the same manner asExample 4 except the polymerization time was 7.5 hours. The purified cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride analyzed 97.61 weight percent trimer and 2.39 weight percent tetramer. Conversion to a high molecular weight LVN 1.5 gel free light colored linear polymer was 71 . EXAMPLE 6 This reaction was conducted in the same manner asExample 4 except solvent removal was continued to give a hot concentrate containing only 5 weight percent monochlorobenzene and the polymerization time was 5 hours. The purified cyclic trimer analyzed 97.61 weight percent trimer and 2.39 weight percent tetramer.Conversion to a gel free colorless linear high molecular weight LVN 1.4 phosphonitrilic chloride polymer was 54 . The following Examples 7 and 8 serve to show how the process has been carried out when using water to wash the crude trimer solution in solvent. EXAMPLE 7 A crude trimer solution was made by adding 2545 grams of PCl5 made from PC13 and C12 dissolved in 5915 grams of monochlorobenzene to a slurry of 835 grams ofNH4C1 made from NH3 plus HC1 in 13318 grams of monochlorobenzene over a 4 hour period at 1249C followed by a 1 hour cook at the same temperature. The resultant crude trimer solution in monochlorobenzene was filtered to remove unreacted ammonium chloride.A 4981 grams portion of the monochlorobenzene solution was then washed with about 2000 grams of water for 1 hour at 60 86 c. The washed monochlorobenzene solution was then heated under vacuum to evaporate monochlorobenzene to obtain 938 grams of a hot concentrate containing about 32 weight percent monochlorobenzene. The hot concentrate was cooled to room temperature causing crystalline trimer to precipitate. The precipitate was removed by filtration in a dry box and washed with cold heptane yielding 153 grams of crystalline trimer which was placed in a simple distillation vessel. A 10 gram forecut of solvent and volatiles was distilled out first and then a 139 gram heart cut was distilled under vacuum. EXAMPLE 8 A 4900 gram portion of a monochlorobenzene solution of crude trimer prepared as in Example 7 was filtered to remove unreacted ammonium chloride. The filtered solution was then heated under vacuum to distill off almost all of the monochlorobenzene solvent leaving a crude trimer residue. The residue was re dissolved in about 4000 mi of beptane and the heptane solution was water washed at 80 C. A portion of the heptane was then distilled out to form a hot trimer concentrate containing about 32 weight percent heptane. The concentrate was cooled to 10iC causing trimer to precipitate.The trimer crystals were washed with cold heptane and then distilled using a simple distillation apparatus. A small forecut of solvent and light ends was removed and then a main cut of polymer grade trimer was distilled at 130 140 C, 16 torr. Surprisingly neither distillation nor crystallization alone will consistently yield a polymerization grade cyclic trimer. Even when the trimer analyzes very pure, it was found that it would not consistently polymerize to a light colored gel free linear high molecular weight polymer. EXAMPLES 9 12 In these comparative examples crude cyclic phosphonitrilic chloride was made in the monochlorobenzene following the same procedure described in Example 1 except that the crude trimer synthesis temperature was 128 C. The resultant solution was filtered to remove unreacted NH4C1 and then distilled in a three plateOldershaw distillation column at a l lreflux ratio and a reduced pressure of 27 30 Torr. The trimer cut was 31 removed at 147 1540C and were analyzed by P NMR to be apparently very pure as shown in the following table. TABLE 1 Example Trimer Tetramer 9 99.76 0.24 10 99.59 0.41 11 99.42 0.51 12 99.71 0.29 This distilled trimer was polymerized as in Example 1 for a 20 hour period. The results are shown in the following table.

The synthesis temperature was 1220C. The trimer solution was filtered and distilled in a ten plate Oldershaw column at a 10 1 reflux ratio. Analysis of the trimer cut indicated 100 trimer. These apparantly pure trimers were polymerized for 20 hours at 2200C in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in the following table.

The crude trimer solutions were filtered and then monochlorobenzene was distilled out to give concentrates containing 28 32 weight percent monochlorobenzene. This concentrate was allowed to cool to room temperature forming a precipitate which was filtered off and washed with heptane. The crystalline precipitate analyzed as follows. TABLE 4 Example Trimer Tetramer 17 92.8 7.2 18 95.83 2.53These crystallized trimers were polymerized for 20 and 12 hours respectively at 220 C as in Example 1 with the following results. TABLE 5 Conversion LVN of Example to Polymer Polymer Color 17 23 OK 18 578 gel amber Comparative Examples 9 18 clearly show that neither crystallization nor distillation alone is capable of consistently giving polymerization grade trimer.Examples 13 16 are of special interest in showing that even though the trimer might analyze as apparantly pure, they still contain some unknown material that results in a black polymer. At present it is not understood why otherwise satisfactory purification techniques fail to consistently give high molecular weight gel free linear polymers of the desired viscosity and color. What is known is that the present process using the combination of crystallization and distillation has consistently given a gel free high molecular weight linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymer.
