# Method and apparatus for manufacturing tea bags and the like.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for manufacturing tea bags and the like is disclosed. The bags are made by forming a web 26 into a flattened closed tube 26 while continuously introducing tea and the like into the tube and pinching the tube with pinch bars 38, 38 at successive locations along transverse pinch lines corresponding generally to the required bag length. The tube is then caused to travel upwardly 36 so that the tea tends to migrate downwardly under gravity and creates voided areas below the pinch locations and the tube is then heat sealed transversely in those voided areas at a heat sealing station 42 . Finally, the bags are severed from the tube along lines disposed generally centrally of each transverse heat seal.
