# Decorative acrylic sheets and articles formed therefrom.

## Abstract
A coloured acrylic sheet having an attractive 3 dimensional depth of colour resulting from the use of a mixture of pigments or a pigment and a dye wherein an inorganic pigment, distributed non uniformly throughout the sheet and a colourant is distributed uniformly through the sheet, the particles of non uniformly distributed pigment being concentrated preferentially towards one surface of the sheet and are visible through the opposite surface of the sheet which is preferably substantially free from the non uniformly distributed pigment. The attractive appearance is further enhanced by shaping the sheet and the sheet is particularly suitable for forming articles of sanitaryware.
