# Improvements in or relating to methods of milking animals, apparatus for use in milking machines and to milking machines.

## Abstract
A milking machine includes a claw for connecting teat cups to a milk line and the claw has a plurality of individual chambers 4 with a milk inlet 6 leading from a teat cup into each chamber 4 and an outlet 8 leading from each chamber 4 to a common chamber 15 in the milk line 16 . The inlets 6 outlets 8 and chambers 4 and 15 are positioned and shaped to give a swirling or vortex action to fluid in the chambers and so that the normal direction of flow of fluid from the teat cups to the milk line cannot be easily reversed thus substantially preventing back flow of milk to the teat cups and cross flow of milk between teat cups. A rapid flow of fluid from any of the outlets 8 tends to induce an increase in flow velocity of air passing again from inlet 18 to outlet 16 which in turn will tend to increase a parallel flow outwardly from each of the other outlets 8 .
