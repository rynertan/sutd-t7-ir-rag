## Description
Detection Method, Use and Diagnostic Aid. This invention relates to a method of detecting a catalyst or a substrate in a catalysable reaction and to the use of this method in the detection of clinically or environmentally important materials present in trace amounts. The desirability of having a method which can detect trace amounts of a catalyst or its substrate which is convenient and does not need the use of radioactive substances or complex equipment is obvious. Known methods of detection, for example heterogenous specific binding assays such as that of British Patent No. 1548741 or homogenous specific binding assays such as that of British PatentNo. 1552607 are useful but can suffer from a lack of sensitivity. A particularly sensitive assay has now been discovered which does not require the use of radioactive substances or complex equipment. Accordingly the present invention provides a method of detecting a catalyst or its substrate in a catalysable reaction which comprises carrying out an assay for the catalyst or the substrate in a manner which produces a product which method is characterized in that said product is an activator for an enzymatic reaction which is activated by the production thereof so as to effect a detectable change and to produce a facilitator for the enzyinatic reaction whereby said enzymatic reaction is enhanced. kEen used herein the term activator means a substance which is required for an enzymatic reaction to take place if all other components needed for that enzymatic reaction are present. When used herein the term facilitator means a substance which is not an enzyme but which acts so as to increase the rate at which the detectable change takes place. The facilitator is most suitably a cofactor for the enzymatic reaction. normally and preferably the facilitator pro ducked by the enzymatic reaction is the same as the activator produced by the assay for the catalyst or its substrate. When the facilitator and activator are the same a desirable simplification of the system occurs. The feedback of the facilitator into the earlier part of the reaction sequence causes a marked increase in the rate of formation of the det ectable change. When used herein the term detectable change means a change in the concentration of a moiety which can be observed. The observation can be by any method but most aptly it is by a change is the optical characteristics, The change in the optical characteristics may be observed by eye or with the aid of a device such as a spectrophotometer. The change in concentration observed may be the increase in concentration of a moiety produced by the enzymatic reaction or it may be the decrease in concentration of a moiety consumed by the enzymatic reaction. The enzymatic reaction may use a single enzyme or more than one enzyme, If more than one enzyme is employed it will aptly be not more than four enzymes, it will more aptly be not more than. three and it will preferably be not more than two enzymes. T ie catalyst to be detected may be an enzyme or a non enzJrmic catalyst. Normally and preferably the catalyst to be detected is an enzyme. Enzymes are often required to be detected in clinical chemical or vetinary investigations. Abnormal levels of enzymes can be present in pathological conditions so that their detection either qualitatively or quantitatively can be used as a diagnostic aid or to monitor the progress of the pathological state. Thus, for example, it is desirable to detect such enzymes as kinases, for example creatine kinase a marker for breast cancer and of use in diagnosing myocardial infarction and brain damage and the like and pyruvate kinase for diagnosis and monitoring of liver muscle pathology and dehydrogenases, for example lactodehydrogenase for diagnosing blood diseases and liver diseases and the like. Alternatively the catalyst may be a non enzymatic catalyst such as an electron transfer reagent. The electron transfer reagent can be a molecule such as phenazine ethosuiphate or its analogues or a quinine or the like and may be conjugated to another molecule if desired. If the method of this invention is used to detect a substrate for a catalyst it is normally and preferably a substrate for an enzyme. Such materials can have clinical significance, for example pyridine nucleotides such as ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP and the like or creatine phosphate cTthe like. Such materials are often of interest in metabolic studies and studies of kidney function. Naturally the terms activator and facilitator as used herein cannot be interpreted as relating to classical cycles such as those of the recognised prior art of BP 1548741 and 1552607. The preferred enzymatic reaction for use in the amplification method of this invention comprise kinases or dehydrogenases. A particularly apt enzymatic reaction employing kinases may be represented as follows EMI6.1 In this system the production of ATP produced by the assay and hence the activator11 enables the PKF to convert F6P to FDP. The thus produced FDP activates the PE I which converts the ADP present to ATP and the PEP to pyruvate which causes a detectable change as explained hereinafter . The ATP produced by the PK I the facilitator feeds back to allow the PFK to produce more FDP which increases the activity of the PK I which leads to the production of more A2P and pyruvate. Hence a marked increase in production of pyruvate occurs which in turn leads to a marked increase in the rate of detectable change. An apt method of using the above enzymatic reaction to lead to a detectable change is to employ the following system EMI7.1 In this system the introduction of pyruvate causes the LDH to oxidize the NhDH to NAD. This can then be monitored spectrophotometrically, for example at 340nm It will be appreciated that the preceeding enzymatic reaction can be adapted to the detection of a nucleotide triphosphate such as ATP or an enzyme that produces such a triphosphate or even a substrate for such an enzyme. Most desirably the preceeding enzymatic reaction is adapted to the detection of an enzyme which produces ATP The preferred ATP producing enzymes are kinases which do not require PDP for their activation. Such enzymes include pyruvate kinase PKII .and creatine kinase CE sometimes also called creatine phosphokinase . In the case of PK II a reaction leading to the production of the activator ArrP is as follows EMI8.1 In the case of CE a reaction leading to the production of the activator ATP is as follows EMI8.2 A particularly apt enzymatic reaction employing dehydrogenase may be represented as follows EMI8.3 Diaphorase requires NAD to function so that NAD free diaphorase is activated by the NAD produced by the catalys The detectable change produced by this reaction is the production of NAD from NADH which may be monitored at 340nm. The skilled worker will appreciate that the reactions hereinbefore discussed are biochemical reactions of the type that will be performed under substantiaAly physiological conditions that is in aqueous solution under non extreme conditions, for example at a temperature of 5 40 0C and more usually 15 370C at pH values of 5 9, more usually of 5.5 8.5 and preferably at approximately 7 pH will generally be maintained in the desired range using a buffer such as DMG or imidazol buffer . It is envisaged that normally all the reagents required for operation of the assay and enzymatic reactions will be present except the activator, facilitator and the material to be detected. The method of this operation comes into effect when the material to be detected is added. In this specification the term detecting extends to quantitative detection as well as to non quantitative detections such detecting is often referred to as determining . In a broad aspect this invention provides a method of detecting an activator as hereinbefore defined which comprises contacting said activator with an enzyme to be activated and all other components needed for the enzymic reaction to proceed characterized in that said enzymatic reaction causes a detectable change and the production of a facilitator as hereinbefore defined whereby said enzymatic reaction is enhanced . The activator may be a substate for an enzyme or it may not be a substrate for an enzyme in which case it will usually be an effector or other substance which can cause the enzyme to operate. The facilitator may be produced as a direct product of the enzymatic reaction or may be produced as a product of a further reaction initiated by the direct product of the enzymatic reaction. The facilitator produced by the enzymatic reaction is desirably the same as the activator so that a simple system results. In one favoured form the activator and facilitator are both ATP An alternative favoured system employs an activator which is a derivative of the facilitator.In such systems the activator is envisaged as a ligand or receptor labelled with the facilitator,In this aspect the skilled worker will appreciate that this aspect of the invention also provides a method of detecting said ligand or receptor labelled with facilitator. Preferably the ligand or receptor labelled in this way is an antigen or antibody when used herein the term labelled means chemically or physically associated in a manner which will not prevent the activation of the enzyme by the thus formed activator . In yet another system the activator is different from the facilitator and is not a ligand or receptor labelled with a facilitator. Favoured facilitators for use in this invention include pyridine nucleotides and ligands or receptors labelled with a pyridine nucleotide, preferred facilitator pyridine nucleotides include ATP and NAD.Preferred ligands and receptors labelled with a pyridine nucleotide include antigens and antibodies labelled with ATP or NAD. British Patents Nos.1548741 and 1552607 disclose ligands or receptors labelled with pyridine nucleotides which may be employed as activators in this invention however said patents did not disclose the use of a system in which amplification was achieved by use of a facilitator which fed back into the assay . A favoured example of a method of detecting an activator according to this invention is the detection of NAD or a ligand or receptor labelled with NAD which comprises contacting said activator with NAD depleted diaphorase, NADH and other required substrate such as oxidized lipoamide or oxidized lipoic acid characterized in that said reaction causes a detectable change the removal of NADH and the production of a facilitator NAD . A favoured example of a method of detecting an activator according to this invention is the detection of ATP or a ligand or receptor labelled with ATP which comprises contacting said activator with PPX, P6P, PK I , ADP, PEP whereby F6P is converted by PFl to FDP which causes TE I to convert ADP to ATP and PEP to pyruvate which ATP is the facilitator and which conversion of PEP to pyruvate is the detectable change. The conversion of PEP to pyruvate can be detected by a method as hereinbefore described, for example by reaction with a bydrazine or by a further enzymatic change . The direct product of the preceeding activated enzyme is F . The thus produced F then triggers the Pl I to produce a detectable change. A particularly simple way of carrying out the method of this invention is to have the above reagents in an appropriate cuvette of a spetrophotometer and to add the solution possibly containing the material to be detected. If the material to be detected is not present no change occurs but if it is present the change may be observed. If desired the use of a spectrophotometer an be obviated in systems producing pyruvate such as the kinase systems hereinbefore described by detecting the formation of the reaction product between pyruvate and a hydrazine such as 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine which gives rise to a visually or machine detectable coloured product when the pH is subsequently rendered alkaline for example with sodium hydroxide solution . As previously explained, the method of this invention is usefully employed in investigating enzymes in biological samples. Unfortunately biological fluids, such as blood, serum and urine can contain a number of reactive species. Clearly it would be desirable to adapt the method of this invention to work with small samples of fluid possibly containing only small amounts of enzymes. Although this will employ a purification step, the increased sensitivity of this method is such as to render losses during purification acceptable. Accordingly in a further aspect this invention provides a method of detecting an enzyme in a liquid,which method comprises i contacting the liquid with a support to which is attached a substance to which the enzyme will bind specifically without eliminating its enzymatic properties, so that said enzyme becomes associated with said support , ii separating the support with its zssociated enzyme from the liquid and iii using the support with its associated enzyme in a detection method of this invention as hereinbefore described. This aspect of the invention is most suitably adapted to the detection of an enzyme in blood, serum, urine, tissue extract or microbiological extract. Since enzymes are often used as markers in the diagnosis of human pathological conditions it follows that the method of this invention is preferably adapted to the detection of an enzyme in human blood, serum or urine. Of course use may be made of this invention in the vetinary field in analogous manner. The support used in this invention may be in the form of a discrete surface such as that of a stick or dish or filter system or in the form of small particules such as a powder or in the form of gel materials.Aptly the support may be polystyrene, nylon, cross linked dextrans such as sephadex. and sepharose agarose , polyacrylamide, bromacetylcellulose or the like. Such materials are presently knows for the immobilization of non enzymatic biological materials such as proteins, for example antigens, nucleic acids and the like. The skilled worker will appreciate that such supports can bind a wide range of materials so that, in conventional manner, in order to prevent uptake of unwanted enzymes or the like from the liquid the support will be neutralised to prevent this, for example by treatment with innocuous protein after the substance to which the enzyme to be detected is bound to the support. The substance bound to the support will normally and preferably be an antibody to the enzyme with te proviso that the antibody employed will not be one that eliminates the enzymatic properties of the enzyme to be detected. ery desirably the antibody will be a monoclonal antibody. The binding of the antibody or other substance to the support may be physical or chemical binding. rhysical binding includes absorption onto the surface of tbc support and chemical binding may be ionic or covalent. Sanwich systems arealso envisaged. DJIe antibody may be bound in any manner as long as it is still capable of specifically binding the enzyme in a manner which will not eliminate the enzyme activity. Alternatively the substance to be bound to the support may be some other substance with specific affinity for the enzyme in question, such as a substrate, substrate analogue or inhibitor substance for that enzyme. Such approaches are possible with enzymes having more than one active enzymic site per enzyme molecule for if only one site is taken up in binding to the support through the substrate, substrate analogue, inhibitor the other site may still be available for catalytic activity. Generally sufficient binding of the enzyme to the support with its bound substance will take place within 10 seconds to 30 minutes depending on the reaction parameters, concentrations employed and degree of accuracy required. ore usually the binding will take place within 30 seconds to 10 minutes and preferably from 1 to 5 minutes. gild ag1t ti on may be employed to facilitate the binding. At the end of the binding stage the liquid may be separated and the support with the enzyme bound thereto washed. Generally it is preferred that this washing is thorough in order to remove unwanted unbound material. Washing may be carried out with water, saline, buffer or the like of which phosphate buffered saline is favoured. Suitably the washing liquid may include a mild surfactant such as a Tween. At this point the support with the enzyme bound thereto may be promptly used in an assay for the enzyme. In another and important aspect this invention provides a diagnostic test which comprises carrying out a method of this invention as hereinbefore described on a biological fluid or on material obtained from a biological fluid as herei.before described0 Desirably this aspect of the invention comprises a diagnostic teSt for breast cancer employing creatine kinase as hereinbefore described. Aptly this aspect of the invention comprises a diagnostic test for muscle damage and also for liver disease employing pyruvate kinase as hereinbefore described.

The following examples illustrate the invention.The following description illustrates the preparation of useful reagents. BEmonstration PreDaration of Pyruvate Kinase I for the examples Cultures of E.coli strain K1 1 were grown on a synthetic medium containing essential nutrients and glycerol as carbon source, until well into their logarithmic phase of growth. The cells were harvested, washed by centrifugation and resuspended in a sonication buffer of 5mM phosphate, 1mM EDUA, 2mM mercaptoethanol pH 7.5 in an amount of approximately 20mg dry weight per ml. They were then disrupted with an MSE ultrasonic disintegrator for 4 minutes in 30 second bursts while cooled . The resulting crude extract was separated from cell debris by centrifugation.As well as containing pyruvate kinase I this extract also contained an interfering isoenzyme with different properties, and also a number of other interfering enzyme activities. It was found, however, that it was possible to remove these contaminants by heating the extract to 55 0C for 20 50 for example 45 minutes. This is the source of pyruvate kinase I referred to in the following examples. Example 1Detection of Pyruvate kinase II In order to demonstrate the enhancement in sensitivity brought about by the method of ts invention an assay for pyruvate kinase 11 as carried out with and without a secondary system to produce amplification.The two assays may be represented as follows Assay without Amplification Assy with ammplificationEMI22.1 As PK I can in the absence of FDP be activated by a high enough concentration of PEP, it is necessary to limit the PEP concentrations used to those which not cause spontaneous activation, while maintaining a sufficient substrate concentration for the enzyme. A concentration of 1ml1 has been found to satisfy these requirements under the conditions employed so far. ln the assay system without amplification PH 11 converts PEP and Al into pyruvate and NADB to NAD and lactate. The change in concentration of NADH can be monitored by absorbence at 340nm. In the assay system with amplification that is the assay incorporating the secondary system the preceeding sequence takes place but in addition te secondary system generates ATP. In this amplified system, in addition tothe PEP. ADP, NADH, PK II and LDH present in the nonamplified system, the following are also present F6P, PFK and PK I . In the presence of ATP generated by catalyst PH II the PFN converts the FCP into FDP.The FDP activates the PK I which then is available to convert the PEP and ADP to ATP and pyruvate The ATP thus produced feeds back within the secondary system and the pyruvate is converted into lactate by LDH in the presence of NADII. This end reaction is monitored at 340nm as in the unamplilied assay. To indicate the usefulness of this amplification method the PK II was initially assayed by the direct raction as follows The assay mix was as son in Table 6 left column witli a buffer consisting of lOnM dimethyl glutamate DMG pH6.8 5mM MgCl2.All assays were carried out at 30 C.the PK II was obtained from Calbiochem and, as a result of trials, a standard amout chosen which gave the activity shown in the Table. This amount was used for all following experiments. PK I was as inprevious experimen The assay system including the positive feed back amplifier was composed as shown on the right hand column of Table 6.The activity attribuatable to the addition of the same amount of PK II as before and after allowing the feedback system to get underway for seven minutes, is shown. The activity attribuable to PK II is raised eleven times over the direct method.

Example 2 Detection of ATP In this example the same basic system test cribbed in Example 1 was again used, but instead of the system being used to detect an enzyme capable of giving rise to ATP, the pre existing ATP in a solution was assayed, using a PE I extract which had been prepared by heating at 55 0C for 60 minutes. As in the previous example , the as says were carried out in quartz spectrophotometer cuvettes for use with 1.0ml assay mixtures. They were made to contain ADP 0.4mM PEP 1.0mM NADH 0.1mM LDH 1.1 U F6P 2.0mM PK I 10ul PEK 1.0U material to be assayed buffer to 1ml All dilutions and solutions were made in this same buffer. The buffer was 10mM dimethyl glutarate pH 6.8 and containing 5mM MgCl2. The test solutions were made to give a finalATP concentrationin the cuvette of 0.4mM 0.05mM 0.01mM 0.001mM 0.0001mM control with no ATP.On addition of a sample to the cuvette containing the above components the contents wcre mixed and the oxidation of NADH followed at 340nm and 30 0C with a spectrophotometer. The higher concentrations of ATP gave rise to an earlier initiation of observableNADH oxidation and subsequently increased in their rate faster than the lower concentrations. The method therefore has utility both in showing the presence of very low concentrations of ATP and also in demonstrating concentration. Example 3Detection of Creatine Kinase The basis for this example is the same as that for with pyruvate kinase described in Example 1.Using the same system creatine kinase can be detected in the presence of its substrate creatine phosphate as then the creatine kinase gives rise to ATP from the ADP present and this activates the system as described in the previous example. The assay conditions themselves are in part based upon those described inMethods in Enzymatic analysis pages 789 793, edited by Hans Ulrich Bergmeyer and published by Verlag ChemieGmbh, Weiheim, 1974. Por determination of creatine kinase a quartz cuvette for use with 1.0ml assay mixtures is made to contain a solution of the following composition ADP 0.4mM PEP 1.0mM NADH 0.1mM LDH 1.1 D P6P 2.0mM 1.0 1.0 U PK I 10ul MgCl2 10mM CP 5mM CK material assayed The mixture is combined in DMG buffer to a final volume of 1.0ml, pH 6.8 and a DMG concentration of 25mM.On addition of the material to be assayed the contents of the cuvette. are mixed and the oxidation of NADII followed spectrophotometrically at 340nm and 300 C as before. Den fold dilutions of creatine kinases creatine phosphokinases obtained from the Sigma London ChemicalCompany Type I from rabbit muscle, C3755, Type III from bovine heart,C7886 and Type IV from rabbit brain, C6638 are made to provide final concentration of from 1U to 0,0010 in the assay mixture when added.Creatine kinase specific activation of the system leads to NADH oxidation, in an analogous manner to the previous example and is dependent on OK concentration. Example A Detection of Creatine Kinase Example 3 may be repeated including 10mM of NAC. This acts as an thiolic activating agent for the enzyme and aids in increasing the sensitivity of the system. Example 5Detection of Creatine Kinase in suspected presence of myokinase Myokinase is sometimes a minor contaminent of enzymes such as PR I . In order to allow the assay of examples 3 or 4 to take place in the presence of trace amounts of myokinase a sufficiency of AMP for example 10mM may be employed in the assay. Inclusion of AMP in assays involving biological fluids is similarly desirable for this reason . Example 6 Five hundred units of eratine phosphokinase from bovine heart and obtained frem th esigma london Chemical Company Ltd Type III catalogue numberC7886 was dissolved in 1ml of the standard buffer used i the assay namely 10mM dimethyl glutarate buffer at pH 6.8 and containing 5mM MgCl2 and 0.1 in bovine serum albumin Sigma London catalogue number A6003 . Three ten fold serial dilutions of this enzyme solution were ti made using the same buffer. Ten micro litre aliquots of each of the dilutions were then tested in standard mixtures of the following composition for their ability to form ATP and thus activate the system. ADP 0.4mM PEP 1.0mM DADB 0.1mM F6P 2.0mM CP 4.0mM LDH 1 enzyme aait PFK 1 enzyme unit 10ul standard preparationThe LDH was obtained from The Boebringer Corporation LoLtd Cat.

No. P 6502 PFK Type III from rabbit musole Cat. No. F 6877. The complete assay mixture fo each test was made to 1ml with the standard buffer in a suitable quartz spectrophotmeter cuvette at 3000. On addition of the final component the creatine phosphokinase to be assayed the contents f the cuvette were well mixed and the oxidation of NADH followed by continuous monitoring at 340nm. The rate of change in optical density at two minutes after initiation was taken for each test and used to compare the activities as follows Units of CK in final O.D.Units 340nm assay mixture change minute at 2 minutes 0.05 0.0216 0.005 0.0068 nil 0.0017 Enzyme Units where quoted in the text are those units used by the particular manufacturers for the enzymes they have supplied. Example 7 This example uses the same reagents and conditions as Example 6, however, instead of showing the dependence of the system on the enzyme creatine kinase in the presence of its substrate creatine phosphate it shows that the system can be made dependent on the presence of the substrate creatine phosphate if creatine kinase is present as a reagent. Mixtures were made up in 10mM dimethyl glu buffer at pH 6.8 and containing 5mM MgCl2 and 0.1 in bovine serum albumin as follows ADP 0.4itWi 0.4mM 0.4mM PEP 1.0mM 1.0mM 1.0mM NADH 0.1mM 0.1mM 0.1mM F6P 2.0mM 2.0mM 2.0mM LDH 1 U 1 U 1 U PFK 1 U 1 U 1 U PK I 10ul 10ul 10ul CK 0.05 U 0.05 U 0.05 U CP 4.0mM 0.4mM nil In each case the components were combined from stock solutions in a quartz cuvette of lml capacity, mixed and immediately monitored for NADH oxidation by following their optical density at 340nm and 30 C. The rate of change of absorbance at 1.5 minutes after mixing was found to be as follows CP concentration O.D. Units 34Onm change minute at 1.5 minutes 4.0mM 0.0118 0.4mM 0.0070 nil 0.0011 The system was seen to be dependent on the presence of creatine phosphate and the concentration thereof.
