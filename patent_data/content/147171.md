## Description
Podery preparation of amorphous dihydropyridine compound The present invention relates to a powdered amorphous 1, 4 dihydro 2, 6 dimethyl 4 t3 nDtrophenyll 3 methoxycarbonyl pyridine 5 c.arboxylic acid 6 5 phenyl 3 pyrazolyloxy hexyl ester. 1,4 Dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 3 nitrophenyl 3 meehoxyearbonyL pyridine 5 carboxylic acid 6 5 phenyl 3 pyrazolyloxy hexyl ester hereafter tentatively referred to as 11dihydropyridine CVA isauseful drug which possesses a long lasting hypotensive effect. As its solid structure, a crystalline form melting point of 151 to 1530C is known Japanese Patent Laid Open 131982 83 . However, when a powdery preparation of crystalline dihydropyridine CVA was orally administered, it was found that dihydropyridine CVA was inadequately transferred from the digestive tract into circulating blood, and as a result the hypotensive effect possessed by dihydropyridine CVA per se was not used efficiently.In view of the foregoing circumstances, the present inventors have investigated extensively and have noted that by converting the solid structure from its crystalline form to an amorphous form, bioavailability of dihydropyridine CVA powdery preparation is improved on oral administration and the hypotensive effect is significantly improved. According to the present invention, a powdered preparation of dihydropyridine CVA characterized by an amorphous solid structure is provided. For an understanding of the principles of the present invention, reference is made to the following description of typical embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Figs. 1 and 2 show powder x ray diffraction patterns Cu K of powder preparations of crystalline and amorphous dihydro pyridine CVA, respectively, obtained by measurement using Geiger. Flex RAD rA manufactured by Rigaku Electric Co., Ltd. . The powder of the present invention can be prepared by melting pale yellow crystals of dihydropyridine CVA Ce.g.prepared in accordance with the process described inJapanese Patent Laid Open 131982 83 at 55 to 1700C under normal pressure or under reduced pressure, cooling the resulting viscous substance at temperatures lower than 400C to solidify it and then grinding the solid to a powder hereafter simply referred to as melting method or by dissolving the crystals in an organic solvent with heating, adding the solution dropwise to water kept at temperatures lower than 100C, collecting the precipitated powders tr filtration and then drying the powders hereafter simply referred to as solution method . In the melting method, the melting is effected within 30 minutes, preferably within 10 minutes.The grinding is carried out using a mortar, a ball mill, a colloid mill, a fluid energy mill, etc., if necessary and desired, under cooling or freezing, in such a manner that a mean particle size of the resulting powder be smaller than 30 pm. In the solution method, suitable examples of organic solvents to be used include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile and acetone and the amount of the organic solvent to be used is generally 5 to 100 ml per 1 g of crystal.The dissolution may be carried out from 300C to a boiling point of the solvent used. According to the solution method, powders having a mean particle size exceeding 30 vm are obtained sometimes in this case, it is desirable to pulverize the powder to obtain a mean particle size smaller than 30 pm. The thus obtained powder of the present invention may be examined for its hypotensive effect, as described below. Sypotensive effect The test was performed using 5 male spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR as one group, weighing 320 to 380 g, warmed for about 5 minutes in a warm box previously kept at 370C.Powdery preparations of the present invention having mean particle sizes of 3.7 im and 30 vm were orally given to rats at a dose of 30 mg kg without anesthesia. Hypotensive effect was determined by measuring systolic blood pressure prior to administration and 2 and 4 hours after administration.The measurement of blood pressure was performed by the tail cuff method, using prograraned electro sphygmomanometer modelPE 300 manufactured by Narco Co., Ltd., USA . The mean particle size of the preparations tested was measured with slight transmission type graininess distribution measurement device SKN Model 500 manufactured by Seishin Enterprise Co.,Ltd. . Each preparation tested was suspended in a 0.5 aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt and was given orally. The results are shown in Table 1. In the table, hypotensive effect is expressed by percentage of a difference between a mean of systolic blood pressure prior to administration of the preparations tested and a mean of systolic blood pressure 2 and 4 hours after administration to the former.The hypotensive effect of a powdery preparation mean particle size, 3.5 vm of crystalline dihydropyridineCVA determined by the experiment under the same conditions is also shown in the table for purpose of comparison. In the test for hypotensive effect, a significant difference was seen between the group treated with the preparation of the invention and the control group, respectively below 0.01 at p value .Table 1EMI3.1 tb SEP Systolic SEP Hypotensive tb Prepa SEP Mean SEP Blood SEP effect tb ration SEP Particle SEP Dose SEP Pressure tb Tested SEP Size SEP Before SEP SEP d SEP tb SEP Administ tb SEP ration SEP 2 SEP Hours SEP 4 SEP Hours tb SEP ism SEP mg kg SEP mmHg SEP After SEP After tb Control SEP SEP SEP SEP 175 SEP SEP 5 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 2 SEP 2 SEP SEP 2 SEP tb Group tb Powdery SEP 30 SEP 30 SEP 178 SEP SEP 9 SEP 66 SEP SEP 7 SEP 66 SEP j SEP 6 SEP tb Prepara tb tion SEP of tb This tb Invention SEP 3.7 SEP 30 SEP 177 SEP SEP 7 SEP SEP 68 SEP SEP 6 SEP 67 iS SEP tb Powdery tb Prepa tb ration tb of SEP Cry tb stay SEP line SEP tb Dihydro tb pyridine tb CVA SEP 3.5 SEP 30 SEP 176 SEP SEP 8 SEP 19 SEP SEP 5 SEP 19 SEP SEP 6 tb As is clear from Table 1, the powdery preparations of the present invention exert long lasting hypotensive effects approximately 3 times higher than that of the powdery preparation of crystalline dihydropyridine CVA without being influenced by particle size of the powder, and it is thus recognized that the powdery preparations of the present invention are antihypertensive drugs which are suited for oral admìnistration. In a test performed using a powdery preparation of the present invention but having a mean particle size exceeding 30 pm, e.g., 100 pm, in similar manner, hypotensive effect almost equivalent to the results shown in Table 1 was also confirmed. The powdery preparation of the present invention can be prepared into granules, tablets, pills or capsules in a conventional manner, by appropriately adding thereto excipients, binders or disintegrators, etc. The present invention will be described more in detail with reference to a reference example and examples below.Reference Example Using Jet O Mizer Mill Grinder manufactured by SeishinEnterprise Co., Ltd. , 200 g of pale yellow crystals of dihydropyridine CVA was ground into powders to obtain 162 g of a pale yellow powdery preparation having a mean particle size of 3.5 iim. A differential scanning calorimetry curve hereafter simply referred to as D.S.C. Curve of the powdery preparation measured under the condition at a temperature range of 75 to 1700C and a temperature elevating rate of 8oC min. showed a endothermic peak at 1530C. Further, the x ray powder diffraction pattern of the preparation was as shown in Fig. 1.Example 1 melting method In a glass container, 10.00 g of pale yellow crystals of dihydropyridine CVA was heated at 1550C for 5 minutes under reduced pressure to obtain a viscous substance. After the viscous substance was cooled to about IOOC to solidify it, the solid was transferred into a porcelain mortar and ground into powders at room temperature to obtain 9.60 g ýield 96.0 of a pale yellow powdery preparation of dihydropyridine CVA.A mean particle size of the thus obtained powdery preparation was 30 zm. This powdery preparation, 2.00 g, was taken into a mortar made of agate and further ground carefully into powder at room temperature to obtain 1.68 g yield, 84.0 t of a pale yellow powdery preparation of amorphous dihydropyridine CVA having a mean particle size of 3.7 vm.

After completionPof .the dropwise addition, stirring was continued for further 30 minutes. Then, the precipitated powders were taken out by filtration and thoroughly dried at room temperature under reduced pressure to obtain 4.58 g yield, 91.6 of a pale yellow powdery preparation of amorphous dihydropyridineCVA having a mean particle size of 10 jim.
