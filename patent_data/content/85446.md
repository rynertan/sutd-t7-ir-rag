# Method and apparatus for combination weighing.

## Abstract
A weighing system for making a predetermined weight of a product comprised of individual articles having variable weights by selecting the product stored in a combination of a predetermined number of storage cups 50, 52 . Quantities of the product having targeted weights are distributed to a plurality of scale controlled hoppers 32, 34 for accurate weighing. The weighed product is fed from each of the scale controlled hoppers 32, 34 to a plurality of storage cups 50, 52 associated with each of the hoppers 32, 34 , and the product weight associated with each storage cup 50, 52 is registered. Specific combinations of storage cups 50, 52 are tested to determine whether the combined product weights therein add to make the desired weight, within acceptable limits. The first combination found to make the weight is used, and the appropriate storage cups 50, 52 are emptied to a container for receiving the product. The appropriate storage cups 50, 52 are refilled from the hoppers 32, 34 and the process repeats. When none of the combinations of the preselected number of storage cups 50, 52 includes a total product wieght within the acceptable limits, the limits are broadened and the cycle repeats. The weighing system includes a programmed microprocessor for controlling oper ation thereof, for providing the combination to be tested, for calculating the combined weights, and for determining whether the combined weight falls within the acceptable limits. A specific distributor 12 for the product includes a reversing rotating portion 16 for preventing clogging of the product at openings 18, 20 provided for chutes 28 connecting the distributor 14 to the scale controlled hop pers 32, 34 .
