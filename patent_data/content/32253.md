# Demodulator carrier recovery loop and method for demodulating a signal.

## Abstract
A recovery loop includes an analog circuit that mixes a fixed frequency signal from a temperature controlled oscil lator 20 with an IF input to produce product signals corres ponding to the quadrature components of data signals with a frequency offset. A digital complex multiplier 32 is respon sive to the product signals and to the output of a number controlled oscillator 34 to produce a digital output corres ponding to the data signals. The output of the number con trolled oscillator 34 is controlled by a digital phase lock loop.
