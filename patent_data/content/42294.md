# Adsorption decaffeination.

## Abstract
Solid caffeine adsorbent which is made more selective to caffeine by a thin layer of a water immiscible, caffeine specific solvent. The caffeine is selectively extracted from the aqueous solution, leaving the solubles necessary for a good tasting beverage, by the solid adsorbent. Because the solvent is se lective, the coated adsorbent likewise shows selectivity.
