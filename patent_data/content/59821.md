# Method and apparatus, e.g. in a data distribution system for, inter alia, avoiding distortion in transfer of signal states.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of transferring data states, e.g. from a terminal 1 to a computer 31 . The inventive concept inter alia includes, in conjunction with transfer of data state on a data bus 24 , that the respective state is accompanied by a time marker from a cyclically operating reference clock 20 . The data state and time marker are transferred to a receiver 22 where time marker and data state are applied to a register, and subsequently sent to the computer 31 when the reference clock 20 has returned to a time rate state 00000101 corresponding to the time marker 00000101 associated with the respective data state.
