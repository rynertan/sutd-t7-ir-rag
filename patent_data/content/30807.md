# Shaped biomedical articles made of polysiloxane polymers.

## Abstract
There are disclosed novel polysiloxane copolymers pre pared by the copolymerization of polysiloxane monomers containing hydrophilic sidechains with polymerizable com onomers to form polymers in a cross linked network. The resulting polymers may be used to form shaped biomedical articles and in particular there are disclosed contact lenses which are water absorbing, soft, flexible, hydrolytically stable, biologically inert and hydrophilic.
