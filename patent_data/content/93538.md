# Sustained release lithium containing tablets and method for their manufacture.

## Abstract
The release pattern of sustained release lithium carbon ate tablets is improved by using a particular form of lithium carbonate material. This should have acicular crystals with a substantially monomodal particle size distribution in which the curve showing volume percentages of particles of different sizes shows a peak at a particle diameter of between 10 and 25 µm. Moreover not more than 20 by volume of the material should have a particular diameter above 30 µm. A preferred sustained release agent is a mixture of glyceryl mono di and tri esters of straight chain saturated fatty acids. The tablets may be made by a moist granulation technique, followed by screening to ensure a granulate of appropriate grain sizes, after which the granulate is com pacted into tablets.

## Description
SUSTAINED RELEASE LITHIUM CONTAINING TABLETS AND METHOD FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The sustained release lithium carbonate tablets manufactured by the applicant company have been well received by the medical profession. Lithium salts are employed in the treatment of affective disorders and in particular as a prophylactic in recurrent manic depressive or depressive illness. The virtue of the sustained release lithium carbonate tablets is that they release lithium at a predetermined rate over a fairly prolonged period, thus enabling the tablets to be taken less frequently than if the lithium was available immediately on consumption of the tablet while still providing an acceptable blood level. A sustained release lithium carbonate tablet was described in our UK Patent 1 209 093, this tablet comprising i a powdered therapeutically active lithium salt ii a sustained release agent comprising a mixture of glyceryl mono , di and tri esters of one or more straight chain C16 C18 saturated fatty acids, and iii other innocuous compounding materials. The tablets may be made by a method which comprises granulation of the above mixture by a moist granulation technique, screening to form a granulate of appropriate grain sizes and compacting the granulate into tablets. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have found that difficulties still remained in the manufacture of sustained release lithium carbonate tablets which would give a satisfactory release pattern of lithium over an extended period. In fact, batches of the tablets were found to give release tirr. 5 which exceeded the desired limits in other words he release of lithium in the usual in vitro release pattern testing procedures was too slow and thus, had the tablets been ingested, the release of lithium would h ve been insufficient to provide a satisfactory therapeu ic level. After considerable investigation and ex triment ation the cause of the trouble was unexpected y found to be in the nature of the crystals of lithium carbonate themselves. According to the present invention we have found that very satisfactory sustained release lithium carbonate tablets can be made, if the lithium carbonate material used in the tablets comprises acicular crystals with an essentially monomodal particle size distribution in which the curve showing volume percentages of particles of different sizes shows a peak at a particle diameter of between 10 and 25 Fm, not more than 20 by volume preferably less than 10 by volume of the material having a particle diameter above 30 Sm. A very suitable sustained release agent for coating the lithium carbonate is a mixture of glyceryl mono , di and tri esters of one or more straight chain saturated fatty acids. Such a material is available and sold by Messrs. Gattefosse of France under the TradeMark Precirol , the acid radicals being principally the radicals of palmitic and stearic acids. A method of making the tablets of the present invention comprises the steps of a mixing i acicular crystals of lithium carbo nate having an essentially monomodal particle size distribution in which the curve showing volume percentages of particles of different sizes shows a peak at a particle diameter of between 10 and 25 Rm, not more than 20 by volume of the material having a particle diameter above 30 Fm ii a sustained release agent comprising a mixture of glyceryl mono , di and tri esters of one or more straight chain saturated fatty acids and iii other in nocuous compounding materials b granulation of the said mixture by a moist gran ulation technique c screening to form a granulate of appropriate grain sizes and d compacting the granulate into tablets.The said other innocuous compounding materials may include a filler such as mannitol, a binding agent such as gum acacia, and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. The aforementioned screening should preferably give a granulate whose particles all pass through a sieve with 1.40 mm apertures, where 20 to 30 pass through a sieve with 250 um apertures while 70 to 80t are retained on a sieve with 250 Fm apertures. A lubricant,such as magnesium stearate, may be added to the granulate after screening and before tabletting. In an embodiment of the invention, not more than .0 of the lithium carbonate material has a particle diameter above 30 um DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a scanning electron micrograph of lithium carbonate material previously used and found to give batches of tablets with insufficiently controlled release times Fig. 2 is a particle size distribution analysis of the material whose electron micrograph is given in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a scanning electron micrograph of lithium carbonate material found to provide satisfactory tablets and Fig. 4 is a particle size distribution analysis of the material whose electron micrograph is given inFig. 3. A comparison of Figs. 1 and 3 shows the essential difference between the crystalline lithium carbonate material found to be unsatisfactory, and that found to give reliably constant results. The lithium carbonate of Fig. 1 consists of minute crystals clustered together whilst the material of Fig. 3 has larger, essentially single acicular crystals. Naturally the particle sizes vary, but we have found that satisfactory results are achieved, as long as the curve showing volume percentages of particles of different sizes shows a peak at a particle diameter of between 10 and 25 m and not more than 20 by volume of the material has a particle diameter above 30 Fm. By particle diameter we mean the diameter of a circle having the same area as the area of the profile of the particle, as seen by the particle size analyser. Figs. 2 and 4 show the particle size distribution analyses of the lithium carbonate material shown in Figs. 1 and 3. In each case the analysis is taken on readings given by a HIAC Trade Mark Particle SizeAnalyser PA 720 using as carrier fluid a 0.5 w 1w solution of Span 20 a non ionic surfactant, Span t being a Trade Mark in toluene. It can be seen that the distribution curve of Fig. 2 shows a number of defined peaks, whilst thelpart cle size distribution of the lithium carbonate mat rial of Fig. 4 is essentially monomodal. As previously indicated, the lithium carbonate material of Figs. 3 aid 4 gives much better results from the point of view of satisfactory release pattern for therapeutic purposes jf lithium than does the material of Figs. 1 and 2. Whilst we do not wish to be bound by any theory as to why chis is so, we believe that the coating round the cluster of crystals of the material of Fig. 1 penetrates to the cluster and round, or nearly round individual particles thus to fill or partially fill the void E ages between the individual crystals comprising the cluste , with the result that, when the coating is exposed to the eroding action of fluid and movement in the gastr intestinal tract1 an insufficient proportion of the surface of the lithium carbonate is exposed and available for solution in the body fluids at any given point in time. Example A batch was prepared with the following ingredients Lithium Carbonate Ph. Eur 60 kg Precirol 5.85 kgMannitol B.P. 9.9 kgj Acacia powder B.P. 3 kg Sodium Lauryl Sulphate B.P. 318 g Magnesiiiin Stearate B.P. 375 g Maize Starch B.P. 3.43 kg The lithium carbonate was supplied by MetallgesellschaftAG, and was in the form of acicular crystals with not more than 10 having a particle diameter above 30 pm. The particle size distribution was found to be nonomodal, the particle size distribution analysis being similar to that shown in Fig. 4. Precirol Trade Mark is a mixture of glyceryl mono , di and tri esters of palmitostearic acids, principally palmitic and stearic acids, supplied byMessrs. Gattefosse of France. The lithium carbonate was blended to ensure uniformity. The mannitol was sieved through a 600 Fm aperture screen and mixed in a mixer with the lithium carbonate and all the other ingredients except the Precirol.The nixer had a jacket for heating by steam or hot water and possessed a horizontal mixer shaft bearing 4 Z shaped blades. The temperature was measured by means of a metal encased thermometer dipping at least 6 inches into the powder. Mixing and controlled heating were continued until a uniform temperature of 700C was attained and held for 15 minutes. An alcoholic solution of Precirol was prepared by dissolving 5.85 kg in 24 litres of alcohol industrial methylated spirit , and bringing the temperature of the solution to 72cC. This solution was poured onto the heated powdered mixture of the other ingredients and mixed for 15 minutes. Twelve litres of water were poured onto the mixture and the whole mass was kneaded. The resulting mass was then dried at 400C by evaporation, e.g. in an Aeromatic dryer. The crude granulate was then passed through a sieve with 1.40 mm apertures, and submitted to a sieve analysis with necessary adjustment made by adding particles from a previous batch to ensure a correct size distri buti n, and particularly that between 70 and 80 are retained on a sieve of 250 Fm aperture size, while the remainder pass through such a sieve. The resulting mixture was then compressed into tabl ts on a rotary tabletting machine with concave tipp i rod shaped punches. The resulting tablets had . weight of about 550 milligrams, a Monsanto hard ess of 4 and contained about 400 milligrams of lithium carbonate and 39 milligrams of Precirol.
