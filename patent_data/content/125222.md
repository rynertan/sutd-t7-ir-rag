# A method for collecting a highly viscous, tough and tacky material from an area covered by such material, and a nozzle for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
A method for collecting from a surface area crude oil or a similar highly viscous, tough and tacky material which covers the surface area as a layer, is characterized by consecutively separating volumes of the layer by means of a curtain of a fluid which under pressure is driven into the layer and has been heated to a temperature capable of lowering the high viscosity of the material in the volume, and applying suction to the material in the volume thus made low viscous, for removing this volume of material from the area. A suction nozzle for carrying out this method has a suc tion channel 1 which is connectible to a suction conduit, a pressure fluid chamber 6 which has pressure fluid inlets and a first pressure fluid outlet 8, 9 surrounding the intake end of the suction channel.
