# Austenitic stainless steel for low temperature service.

## Abstract
An austenitic stainless steel particularly adapted for low temperature applications and having good low temperature properties the steel consists essentially of, in weight percent, carbon 0.03 max., manganese 6.4 to 7.5, silicon up to 1 , chromium 16 to 17.5, nickel 4 to 5.0, copper up to 1 , nitrogen 0.13 to 0.20, and balance iron. The steel is characterized by minimum properties of 17 minimum elongation, 0.025 inch lateral expansion and tensile strength of 175,000 psi at a temperature of 320 F and an M
