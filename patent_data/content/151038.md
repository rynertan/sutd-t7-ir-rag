# System for controlling an elektromagnetic clutch for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A system is described for controlling an electromagnet ic clutch 1 for an infinitely variable belt drive transmission. The system is provided with various input sensors, including an accelerator pedal switch 55 for producing an output sig nal at release of an accelerator pedal, and a vehicle speed detector 61, 62 for producing an output signal related to vehicle speed, the selector lever position switches 51, 52, 53 engine speed detector 60, 64 , air conditioner switch 58 and choke switch 57 . The system controls the current flow ing through the electromagnetic coil 15 of the clutch 1, for example, the system is arranged to produce a small drag current signal in dependence or when the accelerator pedal is released and the vehicle speed is low, so that a small drag clutch current flows in a coil of the electromagnetic clutch.
