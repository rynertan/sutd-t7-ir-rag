# Process for making a lyophilized product for use in skeletal imaging.

## Abstract
A process for making a lyophilized composition, useful for skeletal imaging containing diphosphonates, stannous reduc tant, and an ascorbate or reductate stabilizer. The process comprises 1 preparing an aqueous solution of diphospho nate, reductant, and stabilizer, 2 adjusting the pH of the solu tion formed in step one to a pH in the range from about 5.5 to about 6.5, and 3 lyophilizing the pH adjusted solution.
