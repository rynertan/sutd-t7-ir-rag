# Shaving apparatus.

## Abstract
A shaving apparatus comprises a first cutting member 1 arranged to be driven in rotation and having a central body 8 provided with blades 6 , and a second cutting member 3 having a wall 4 which is provided with hair entry apertures 5 . The first cutting member is coupled by means of a shaft 9 to a driving mechanism. Interposed between the blades 6 and the driving mechanism is at least one resilient element in the form of a leaf spring 7 which in the longitudinal direction extends radially relative to the shaft and extends in cross section substantially obliquely i.e. both in the axial direction towards the second cutting member and in the direction of rotation. Due to the forces occurring during the cutting of a hair, the relevant blade is urged against the wall of the second cutting member through the reaction of the resilient element.
