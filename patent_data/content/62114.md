## Description
FRACTIONATION or. TRIGLYCERIDE MIXTURES Technical Field The field of the invention is the separation of triglyceride mixture to obtain product s cf IodineValue different from that of said mixture. Tile invention is useful, for example, to remove a particular undesirable lower Iodine Value fraction. A very important application of this is the treatment of oils with mostly unsaturated fatty acid moieties e.g.sunflower oil to reduce the content of triglyceride with fatty acid moiety having saturated carbon chain.This allows production of a salad o cooking oil with essentially zero percent saturates by FDA nutritional standards . The invention is also useful, for example, to remove an undesirable higher Iodine Value fraction from a feedstock. An important application of this is the promising of soybean cl to reduce the content ot triglyceride with linolenic acid moiety to minimize the development ot rancidity and odor and there obtain the benefits of touch hardening without the disadvartages of cis to trans isomerization, double bond position changes and neeti to remove catalyst and hydrogenation odor. Other important applications of the invention are the recovery of increased trilinolein level composition from regular safflower oil and the recovery of increased triolein level composition from high oleic aft lower oil. The invention is also useful for obtaining particularIodine Value cuts for any special purpose. Background Art Logan et al U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 134029 filed March 26, 1980 , discloses the fractionation of triglyceride mixtures utilizing macroreticular strong acid cation exchange resin adsorbents. The invention herein differs, for example, in utilizing an adsorbent which is advantageous over that used in S.N. 134029 from the standpoints of flexibility, dynamic capacity, cost, and of being inorganic rather than organic in nature. It is known to remove various non triglyceride impurities from triglyceride mixtures utilizing various aluminosilicate adsorbents. See, for example U.S. Patent No. 852,441 U.S. Patent No. 2,28S,441 U.S. Patent No. 2,314,621 U.S. Patent 2,509,509 U.S. PatentNo. 2,577,079. This kind of art discloses using aluminosilicates to decolorize, deodorize, treat used oil, ref ine, remove trace metals, remove catalyst and remove free fatty acid. The process herein differs, for example, in the feedstock which is essentially free of the type of impurities to which this hody of prior art is addressed to removing. It is known on an analytical scale to separate triglyceride mixtures utilizing silica gel treated with silver nitrate. See, for example, Journal of the AmericanOil Chemists Society, 41, pp 403 406 June 1964 . .The adsorbent there has the disadvantage of having a shot life cycle in that the silver nitrate being not chemically attached is leached out. The adsorbent used herein has no such short life cycle problem. U.S. Patent No. 2,197,861 suggests the possibility of utilizing an aluminosilicate to cause polymerization in an animal, vegetable or marine oil whereby unpolymerized material is read separated from polymerized material. Such a process would have the disadvantage of producing unuseful polymerized material.The process of the instant invention is carried out without significant polymerization occurring.

These crystalline aluminosilicate adsorbents typically contain up to 25 amorphous aluminosilicate, e.g., clay. The process of the invention herein differs, for example, in the feedstock. The process of the invention herein also differs in the adsorbent which is advantageous over the crystalline zeolite adsorbents from the standpoints of versatility in that, with the adsorbent herein, the same equipment and packing is advantageously used for separation of alkyl carboxylates and triglycerides this is not true for crystalline zeolites , flexibility in that various ratios of surface silicon atoms to aluminum atoms and various surface areas are readily available for the adsorbent herein there is substantially less choice for crystalline zeolites , and dynamic capacity in respect to selectively adsorbing triglyceride of higherIodine Value .

The process of the instant invention differs at least in the feedstock and the adsorbent particle size. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for fractionating triglyceride mixtures on the basis of Iodine Value utilizing an adsorbent which is made from low cost and readily available materials, which is readily provided with selected characteristics ready choice in ratio of surfacesilicon atoms toaluminium atoms, silica gel pore size and surface area, and cation substituents and level thereof , which is not subject to a cation leaching problem as is silver nitrate treated silica gel , which has a particle size appropriate for commercial processing no significant handling or loss problems as with microparticulate particle sizes , which is advantageous over crystalline zeolite adsorbents from the standpoints of flexibility and dynamic capacity and which is advantageous over resin adsorbents from the standpoints of flexibility, dynamic capacity, cost, and of being inorganic in nature.Summary of the Invention According to the present invention a process for separating a mixture of triglycerides with differentIodine Values and having their carboxylic acid moieties contains from 6 to 26 carbon atoms, to produce fractions of higher Iodine Value and lower Iodine Value comprises the steps of a contacting a solution of said mixture in a solvent with surface aluminated silica gel adsorbent to selectively adsorb triglyceride of higher Iodine Value and to leave in solution a fraction of said mixture enriched in content of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value, b removing the solution of the fraction enriched in content of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value from contact with the loaded adsorbent, c contacting the loaded adsorbent with solvent to cause desorption of the adsorbed triglyceride and provide a solution in the solvent of the fraction enriched in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value, d removing the solution of the fraction enriched in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value from contact with the adsorbent said mixture of triglycerides being essentially free of impurities which can foul the adsorbent the solvent in step a and the solvent in step c having the same composition or different compositions and being characterized by a solubility parameter on a 25 C basis 6 in the range of from 7.0 to 15.0, a solubility parameter dispersion component on a 25 C basis aD in the range from 7.0 to 9.0, a solubility parameter polar component on a 250C basis aP in the range of from 0 to 6.0 and a solubility parameter hydrogen bonding component on a 250C basis aH in the range of from 0 to 11.5 said adsorbent being derived from silica gel having a mean pore diameter of at least 75 x 1O lOm and a surface area of at least 100 square meters per gram said adsorbent being further characterized by a ratio of surfacesilicon atoms to aluminium atoms ranging from 3 1 to 20 1, a moisture content less than 10 by weight and a particle size ranging from 0.074 mm 0.841 mm said adsorbent having cation substituents selected from those capable of forming IT complexes and those not capable of forming it complexes and combinations of these the solvent in step a and the solvent in step c and the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms in the adsorbent and the level of cation substituents capable of forming it complexes being selected to provide selectivity in step a and desorption in step c . General Des cription of the Invention The invention herein involves fractionating triglyceride mixture, on the basis of Iodine Value, utilizing selected solvent s and selected surface aluminated silica gel adsorbent. The feed Csometimes called feedstock2 is a mixture of triglycerides with different Iodine Values Ca mixture of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value with triglyceride of lower Iodine Value . which is to be separated to produce fractions of higher Iodine Value and lowerIodine Value. The triglycerides in the feed have carboxylic acid moieties which contain carbon chains containing from 6 to 26 carbon atoms. It is important that the feed is essentially free of impurities which can foul the adsorbent thereby causing loss of fractionating performance The feed is dissolved in particular solvent the adsorption vehicle .The solution which is formed is contacted with particular surface aluminated silica gel adsorbente Triglyceride of higher Iodine Value is selectively adsorbed on such adsorbent, and a fraction of the mixture which is enriched compared to the feed in content of triglyceride of lower iodine Value is left in solution. Solution of the fraction which is enriched in content of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value is removed from contact with the adsorbent which has selectively adsorbed triglyceride of higher IodineValue this solution is denoted a raffinate. Fraction enriched in content of triglyceride of lower IodineValue can readily be recovered from the raffinate as described later. The adsorbent which has selectively adsorbed thereon triglyceride of higher Iodine Value is contacted with particular solvent the desorbent to cause desorption of adsorbed triglyceride and provide a solution in the solvent of fraction enriched compared to the feed in content of triglyceride of higherIodine Value. Solution in solvent of fraction enr.iclled in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value is removed from contact with the adsorbent which has undergone desorption of. triglyceride this solution is denoted an extract.Fraction enriched in content of triglyceride of higherIodine Value can be readily recovered from the extract as described later. Preferred is a process where the solvent which is used to dissolve feed for selective adsorption that is, the adsorption vehicle ., and the solvent which is used as the vehicle for desorption that is, the desorben have the same composition. Such process is conveniently referred to herein as a one solvent process. Preferably, such one solvent process is carried out continuously utilizing a simulated moving bed unit operation. Less preferred is a process where the solvent which is used as the dissolving phase during adsorption and the solvent which is used as the vehicle for desorption have different compositions. This process is conveniently referred to herein as a two solvent process. In general, the solvent s utilized herein whether in a one solvent process or in a two solvent process is are characterized hy a solubility parameter on a 250 C. basis ranging from 7.0 to 15.0, a solubility parameter dispersion component on a 250C. basis ranging from 7.0 to 9.0, a solubility parameter polar component on a 250C. basis ranging from O to 6.0 and a solubility parameter hydrogen bonding component on a 250C. basis ranging from 0 to 11.5. The surface alininated silica gel adsorbent forthe process herein is a synthetic amorphous aluminosilicate cation exchange material. It is homogeneous with respect to silicon atoms but not with respect to aluminum atoms aluminum atoms are present essentially entirely at the surface of the adsorbent i.e., they are associated with surface silicon atoms and are considered to be essentially completely in the form of aluminate moieties. The adsorbent is derived from silica gel having a mean pore diameter of at least 50 x 10 metres and a surface area of at least 100 square metres per gram. The adsorbent is further characterized by a ratio of surface silicon atoms toaluminiunr atoms ranging from 3 1 to 20 1, a moisture content less than 10 by weight and a particle size ranging from 200 mesh to 20 mesh. The adsorbent has cation substituents selected from the group consisting of cation substituents capable of forming Tr complexes and cation substituents not capable of forming s complexes and combinations of these. The adsorbent is formed by first treating particular silica gel with aluminate ion then, if necessary, adjusting the cation content e.g. by providing a selected level of cation substituents capable of forming Tr complexes and adjusting the moisture content. Particle size can also be adjusted. The solvent s that is, the adsorption vehicle and the desorbent, whether in a one solvent process or a two solvent process , the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms in the adsorbent, and the level of cation substituents capable of forming s complexes which level can range from none at all up to 100 of exchange capacity are selected to provide selectivity during adsorption and satisfactory desorption of adsorbed triglyceride. Processing is carried out without significant polymerization of triglyceride occurring. The invention herein contemplates one stage processing as well as processing in a plurality of stages.On stage processing is suitable for separating a mixture into two fractions. Multistage processing is suitable for separating a mixture into more than two fractions. As used herein , the term selectively in the phrase selectively adsorb describes the ability of the adsorbent to preferentially adsorb a component or components. In practice, the component s which is are preferentially adsorbed, is are rarely ever the only component s adsorbed. For example, if the feed contains one part of a first component and one part of a second component, and 0.8 parts of the first component and 0.2 parts of the second component are adsorbed, the first component is selectively adsorbed. The magnitudeoof the selective adsorption is expressed herein in terms of relative selectivity, that is, the ratio of two components in the adsorbed phase extract divided by the ratio of the same two components in the unadsorbed phase raffinate. In other words, relative selectivity as used herein is defined by the following equation Concentration M Concentra,ion N A Selectivity Concentration M Concentration N U where M and N are two components of the feed represented in volume or weight percent and the subscripts A and U represent the adsorbed and unadsorhed phases respectively.When the selectivity is 1.0, there is no preferential adsorption of one component over the other. A selectivity larger than 1.0 indicates preferential adsorption of component M in other words, the extract phase is enriched in M and the raffinate phase is enriched in N. The farther removed the selectivity is from 1.0, the more complete the separation. The amount selectively adsorbed per unit volume of adsorbent in a batch equilibrium test mixing of feed dissolved in solvent with adsorbent for up to one hour or until no further chänge in th e chemical composition of the liquid phase occurs is the static capacity of the adsorbent. An advantage in static capacity indicates a potential advantage in dynamic capacity. Dynamic capacity is the production rate in continuous operation in apparatus of predetermined size to obtain predetermined purity product s . The meaning of the terms triglyceride of higherIodine Value and triglyceride of lower Iodine Value as.used herein depends on the context of the application of the invention. The triglyceride of higher Iodine Value .has to include the triglyceride of highest IodineValue and can and often does consist of a plurality of triglycerides of different Iodine Values. The triglyceride of lower Iodine Value has to include the triglyceride of lowest Iodine Value e.g. saturated triglyceride, i.e., triglyceride having all fatty acid moieties having saturated carbon chains, if such is present in the mixture being separated and can and often does consist of a plurality of triglycerides of different Iodine Values. The important point is that the separation is one on the basis of Iodine Value. The term Iodine Value is used in its normal meaning in relation to degree of unsaturation of fats and is described fully in Swern, Baileys IndustrialOil and Fat Products, Interscience, 3rd edition, pages 63 and 64. The composition of triglyceride mixtures is sometimes referred to herein as containing a percentage of particular fatty acid moiety on a methyl ester basis or on a fatty methyl ester basis or is defined on a methyl ester basis as containing percentages of methyl esters.Such percentages are obtained by determining the weight percentage of particular methyl ester in the methyl ester mixture obtained by converting triglyceride fatty acid moieties into corresponding methyl estersThus, for example, a triglyceride mixture containing 7 linolenic acid moiety on a methyl ester basis means that the methyl ester mixture obtained on converting the fatty acid moieties of such triglyceride mixture contains by weight 7 methyl linolenate. The term solvent as used herein refers both to solvent blends i.e., solvents consisting of a plurality of constituents and to pure compounds, i.e., solvents consisting of a single constituent unless the context indicates otherwise. The terms solubility parameter , solubility parameter dispersion component , solubility parameter polar component and solubility parameter hydrogen bonding component as used herein are defined by equations 6 10 at page 891 of Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of ChemicalTechnology, 2nd edition, Supplement Volume, published by Interscience Publishers John Wiley Sons , NewYork, 1971. Values herein for solubility parameter, solubility parameter dispersion component, solubility parameter polar component and solubility parameter hydrogen bonding component are for solvents at 250C. i.e., they are on a 250C. basis . As on page 891, the symbols d D P and H are used herein to refer respectively to solubility parameter , solubility parameter dispersion component , solubility parameter polar component , and solubility parameter hydrogen bonding component . For many solvents the values for D, P and H are given in Table I which directly follows page 891 and the value for 6 is calculated using equation 6 on page 891.For solvents consisting of a plurality of constituents, the values for 116D111 dp and 6H are calculated by summing the corresponding values for the constituents multiplied by their volume fractions and the value for 6 is calculated using equation 6 on page 891. The surface area of the silica gel is measured by the B.E.T. nitrogen adsorption technique described in Brunauer, Emmett and Teller, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60, p. 309 1938 . The mean pore diameter of the.silicavgel is determined by determining pore volume determining surface area as described above, assuming that the pores are cylindrical and thdt the entire surface area consists of the surface of cylindrical pores, and solving simultaneous equations, Pore volume is readily determined by techniques well known i,n the art see, for example, Introduction to Powder SurfaceArea, S. Lowell, John Wiley Sons, N.Y. 1979 . The term surface silicon atom as used herein means a silicon atom attached to only three other silicon atoms by Si O bonds. Determination of the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminum atoms in the surface aluminated silica gel adsorbent is readily carried out by determining the number of surface silicon atoms assuming the presence of 8 silicon atoms per square nanometer of surface area the figure of 8 silicon atoms per square nanometer of surface area is found, for example, in Iler, R.K.The Colloid Chemistry of Silica and Silicates, CornellUniversity Press, Ithaca, New York 1955, p. 58 of the silica gel from which the adsorbent is derived and determining the number of aluminum atoms, for example, utilizing elemental analysis, and calculating. The term cation substituents means the exchangeable cations associated with the adsorbent. The cation substituents capable of forming s complexes are cation substituents capable of attracting and holding unsaturated materials the greater the degree of unsaturation, the greater the attracting and holding power by formation of a particular kind of chemisorption bonding known as w bonding. The cation substituents not capable of forming W complexes do not have significant ability to form such chemisorption bonds.The fonnation of s complexes is considered to involve two kinds of bonding 1 overlap between occupied Tr molecular orbital of an unsaturate and an unoccupied d orbital or dsphybrid orbital of a metal and 2 overlap between an unoccupied antibonding Tr molecular orbital of the unsaturate and one of the occupied metal d or dsp hybrid orbitals sometimes referred to as back bonding . This Ir complexing is described, for example, in Chem. Revs. 68, pp. 785 806 1968 . The term adsorbent surface area as used hereinafter in defining silver substituents level is also measured by the B.E.T. nitrogen adsorption technique referred to above and is measured on the adsorbent after silvering and moisture adjustment. The level of silver substituents is referred to hereinafter terms of m .llimoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area. This is determined by determining the amount of silver e.g. by elemental microanalysis or utilizingX ray fluorescence , by obtaining the adsorbent surface area as described above and calculating. The term moisture content as used herein in relation to the adsorbent means the water present in the particles of adsorbent according to measurement by Karl Fischer titration or by determining weight loss on ignition at 4000C. for 2 4 hours. The moisture content values presented herein are percentages by weight. Detailed Description The triglycerides in the feed have the formulaEMI15.1 in which each R is aliphatic chain which contains 5 to 25 carbon atoms and is the same or different within a molecule. The aliphatic chains can be saturated or unsaturated, The unsaturated aliphatic chains are usually mono , d or triunsaturated , The triglyceride mixtures for feed into a one stage process or into the first stage of a multistage process can be or are readily derived from naturally occurring fats and toils such as, for example, butter, corn oil, cottonseed oil, lard, linseed oil, olive oil, palm oil, palm kernel ol, peanut ol, rapeseed oil, safflower oil both regular and high oleSclf sardine Oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and tallow. It is important that the triglyceride feedstock is essentially free of impurities such as gums, free fatty acids mono and diglycerides, color bodes, odor bodies, etc. which can foul i.e. deactivate the adsorbent thereby causing loss of fractionating performance.Such impurities are non triglycerides which would be preferentially adsorbed and not desorbed thereby inactivating adsorption sites. The clean up of the feedstock is accomplished by numerous techniques known in the art, such as alkali refining, bleaching with Fullers Earth or other active adsorbents, vacuum steam stripping to remove odor bodies, etc. One very important feedstock is refined and bleached sunflower oil, Another.important feedstock is refined, bleached and deodorized soybean oil containing from 6.5 to 8.5 by weight of linolenic acid r.oiety on a.fatty methyl ester basis and having an Iodine Value ranging from 130 to 150. Still another important feedstock is refined, bleached and deodorized safflower oil Cessentially free of wax and free fatty acids . In a one solvent process the feed is usually introduced into the adsorbing unit without solvent and is dissolved in solvent already in the unit, introduced, for example, in a previous cycle to cause desorption.If desired, however, the feed in a one solvent process can be dissolved in solvent prior to introduction into the adsorbing unit or the feed can be raffinate or extract from a previous stage comprising triglyceride mixture dissolved in solvent. In a two solvent process, the feed is preferably dissolved in the solvent constituting the vehicle for adsorption prior to introduction into the adsorbing unit. Turning now to the solvents useful herein for a one solvent process where the same solvent composition performs the dual role of being the dissolving phase during adsorption and the vehicle for desorption , these are preferably characterized by 6 in the range of from 7.0 to 10.5, bD in the range of from 7.0 to 9.0, dP in the range of from 0.2 to 5.1 and dH in the range of from 0.3 to 7.4. More preferably solvents for use in a one solvent process herein are characterized by 6 in the range of from 7.4 to 9, dD in the range of from 7.25 to 8.0, dP in the range of from 0.5 to 3.0 and dH in the range of from 0.7 to 4.0.

Examples of suitable hydrocarbons are pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, isopentane and cyclohexane.Examples of esters suitable for use in or as the solvent are methyl formate, methyl acetate ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, propyl formate and butyl formate. Examples of ketones suitable for use in or as the solvent are acetone,.methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and diethyl ketone. Another important group of solvents for a one solvent process are alkyl ethers containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms in each alkyl group and blends of these with the hydrocarbon, ester and ketone solvents set forth above.Specific examples of solvents within this group are diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether. Yet another important group of solvents for a one solvent process are blends of C13 alcohols e.g. from 5 to 40 by volume alcohol with the hydrocarbon, ester and ketone solvents set forth above.Specific examples of solvents within this group are blends of methanol or ethanol with hexane. Very preferably, the solvent for a one solvent process comprises ethyl acetate with blending with hexane being utilized to weaken the solvent and blending with ethanol being utilized to strengthen the solvent. In most continuous one solvent processes envisioned within the scope of the invention, the solvent is introduced into the process in a desorbing zone and sufficient solvent remains in the process to perform at a downstream location the dissolving function for adsorption. The solvent to feed ratio fd a one solvent process generally ranges on a volume basis from 4 1 to 100 1 and preferably ranges from 5 1 to 40 1 We turn now to the solvents useful herein for a two solvent process where different solvent compositions are used as the dissolving phase during adsorption and as the vehicle for desorption . For a two solvent process herein, the solvents for use as the dissolving phase during adsorption, i.e., as the adsorption vehicle, are preferably characterized by 6 ranging from 7.3 to 14.9, dD ranging from 7.3 to 9.0, 6P ranging from 0 to 5.7 and dH ranging from 0 to 11.0.More preferred solvents for the adsorption vehicle for a two solvent process herein are characterized by ranging from 7.3 to 9.0, bD ranging from 7.3 to 8.0, dP ranging from 0 to 2.7 and dH ranging from 0 to 3.6.Very preferably, the solvent for the adsorption vehicle.in a two solvent process herein is hexane or a blend consisting essentially of hexane and up to 15 by volume ethyl acetate or diisopropyl ether. For a two solvent process herein, the solvents for use as the vehicle for desorption, i.e., as the desorbent, are preferably characterized by 6 ranging from 7.4 to 15.0 and at least 0.1 greater than the 6 of the adsorption vehicle, bD ranging from 7.3 to 9.0, dP ranging from 0.3 to 6.0 and at least 0.3 greater than the do of the adsorption vehicle, and dH ranging from 0.5 to 11.5 and at least 0.5 greater than the 6H of the adsorption vehicle.More preferred solvents for the desorbent for a two solvent process herein are characterized by a 6 ranging from 7.4 to 10,0, dD ranging from 7.3 to 8.0, 6P ranging from 0.5 to 4.0, and 6H ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 and having 6, dP and H, respectively, greater than the.6, 6P and 6H of the adsorption vehicle by at least the amounts stated above. Important desorbents for use in a two solvent process herein include ethyl acetate blends consisting essentially of ethyl acetate and up to 80 by volume hexane blends consisting essentially of ethyl acetate and up to 25 by volume methanol or ethanol and diisopropyl ether. Very preferably, the solvent for the desorbent in a two solvent process herein comprises ethyl acetate. It is preferred both in a one solvent process herein and in a two solvent process herein to avoid use of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents as these shorten adsorbent life. We turn now in detail to the adsorbent for use herein. It is defined the same regardless of whether it is used in a one solvent process or in a two solvent process. The bonding of aluminate groups to surfacesilicon atoms of the silica gel from which adsorbent herein is derived to provide the adsorbent herein characterized by aluminium atoms present essentially entirely in anionic moieties at the surface is indicated by the following chemical structure.which is believed to represent anionic sites in such adsorbent EMI21.1 wherein the silicon atoms which are depicted are suface silicon atoms. The cation substituents are associated with such anionic sites to provide electrostatic neutrality. The characterization of the adsorbent in terms of mean pore diameter and surface area of the silica gel from which it is derived is important to obtaining appropriate dynamic capacity. If adsorbent is used derived from silica gel starting material with a mean pore diameter of less than the aforestated lower limit of 50 x 10 10 metres, dynamic capacity becomes quite low. This means that the separation is not as complete or that a large number of columns have to be used in the simulated moving bed unit operation described hereinafter or very low flow rates or long contact times are required to be used to obtain good separation. This is because with small diameter pores, the triglyceride cannot get into the interior in the time allotted and the accessible pdrtions of the adsorbent become saturated and the partition coefficient approachs zero and mass transfer ceases. The silica gel surface area normally corresponding to a mean pore diameter of 50 x . 10 10 metres is 600 square meters per gram. If adsorbent is used derived from silica gel starting material having a surface area less than the aforestat ed lower limit of 100 square meters per gram, both static and dynamic capacity become quite low. This means separation is poor even with low production rates, long processing times or a large number of columns. The silica gel mean pore diameter normally corresponding to a surface area of 100 square meters per gram is 200 x 10 10 metres. Preferably, the adsorbent herein is derived from silica gel having a mean pore diameter of at least 75 x 10 10 grams and a surface area of at least 300 square meters per gram. The silica gel surface area normally corresponding to a mean pore diameter of 75 x 10 10 metres is 475 square metres per gram. The silica gel mean pore diameter normally corresponding to a surface area of 300 square meters per gram is 120 x 10 10 metres. The characterization of the adsorbent herein in terms of ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms is important in relation to selectivity. The lower limit of 3 1 is related tothe chemical structure of the adsorbents herein in such structure, aluminate moiety is associated with three silicon atoms. The upper limit of 20 1 has.been selected to provide sufficient adsorbing power to obtain selectivity in some fractionation envisioned.In most instances in important applications of this invention, the adsorbent preferably is characterized by a ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminiurr atoms ranging from 3 1 to 12 1. We turn now to tI.re cation eubstitucnt.c cif the adsorbant. The cation substituents capable of forming complexes are preferably selected from the group consisting of silver in a valence state of 1 , copper in a valence state of 1 , platinum in a alence state of 2 , palladium in a valence state of 2 and combinations of these. The cation substituents not capable of forming complexes are preferably selected from the group consisting of cation substituents from Groups IA andIIA of the Periodic Table and zinc cation substituents and combinations of these and very preferably are selected fro the group consisting of sodium, potassium, barium, calcium, magnesium and zinc substituents and combinations of these. Most preferably, the adsorbent has cation substituents selected from the group consisting. of silver substituents in a valence state of one and sodium substituents and combinations of these Preferably, cation substituents sch as hydrogen, which cause deterioration of the adsorbent structure e.g. by stripping.aluminium therefrom should be avoided or kept at a minimum. Fractionations are envisioned herein utilizing adsorbent with no cation substituents capable of forming Ir complexes e.g. together with a weak solvent as the adsorption vehicle . Such adsorbent functions by a physical adsorption mechanism to preferentially adsorb triglyceride of higher Iodine Value. Preferably, however, the adsorbent utilized has cation subst ituei ts capable of forming E complexes as at least some of its cation substituents these adsorbents function by a combination of physical adsorption and the type of chemical adsorption known as v complexing topreferentially adsorb triglyceride of higher IodineValue. Very preferably, the adsorbent has a level of silver substituents greater than 0.05 millimoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area. The upper limit on silver is found in a fully silver exchanged adsorbent with a ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms of 3 1 and is 0.44 milli . moles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area. Most preferably, the adsorbent has a silver level ranging from 0.10 rmi11imoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area to 0.35 r.illimoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area. Amount of silver is readily measured utilizing X ray fluorescence or elemental microanalysis. The ratio of surface silicon atoms to alwitinium atoms and the level of cation substituents capable of forming ir complexes interrelate, and the selection of these governs adsorbing power and therefore selectivity.These also have an effect on static and on dynamic capacity. The ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms selected sets the maximum amount of cation substituents capable of forming W complexes that can be introduced. This is because the cation substituents are held by the negative charges associated with aluminiumatoms in anionic moieties, with a monovalent cation substituent being held by the charge associated with a single aluminium atom and a divalent cation substituent being held by the charges associated with two aluminium atoms. With the silica gel starting material surface area held constant, and with the level of cation substituents capable of forming s complexes being held at the same percentage of exchange capacity, as the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms is increased, the adsorbing power and capacity static and dynamic decreases. With the surface area of the silica gel starting material held constant and with the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminiumatoms held constant, increasing the level of cation substituents capable of forming ar complexes results in increasing adsorbing power and capacity static and dynamic .With the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms held constant and the level of cation substituents capable of forming s complexes held constant, using adsorbent derived from silica gel of increased surface area increases capacity static and dy0 amic up to the point where increase in silica gel starting material surface area results in decrease in mean pore diameter to the extent that dynamic capacity is adversely affected. The moisture content is important in the adsorbent because too much moisture causes the adsorbent to be oleophobic water occupies pores of the adsorbent preventing feed from reaching solid surface of the adsorbent . The less the moisture content is, the greater the adsorbing power and capacity. The upper limit of 10 by weight moisture content has been selected so that the adsorbent will perform with at least mediocre efficiency. Preferably, the moisture content in the adsorbent is less than 4 by weight. The adsorbents herein generally have particle sizes ranging from 0.074 to 0.841 mm. Use of a particle size less than 0.074 mm provides handling problems and can result in loss of adsorbent as a result of very small particles forming a stable suspension in solvent. Use of a particle size greater than 0.841 mm results in poor mass transfer. For a continuous process, particle sizes of 0.177 to 0.595 mm are preferred using particle sizes larger than 0.595 mm reduces resolution and causes diffusion mass transfer limitations and using particle sizes less than 0.177 mm results in high pressure drops. Preferably, there is narrow particle size distribution within the aforestated ranges to provide good flow properties. We turn now to the preparation of the adsorbent. The silica gel starting material is selected on the basis of mean pore diameter, surface area and particle size. As indicated above, the mean pore diameter must be at least 50 x 10 10 metres, and the surface area must be at least 100 square metres per gram. The particle size must be at least 0.074 mm since the adsorbent has a particle size approximately the same as the particle size of the silica gel particles which are reacted to provide the adsorbent. Thus, microparticulate silica gels are unacceptable for use in producing the. adsorbent herein. Silica gel starting materials including particles with a size greater than 0.841 mm are readily made useful, for example, by sieving out larger particles if only some are present or by size reducing and sieving if a substantial part of the particles is too large.Preferred silica gel starting materials are sold under the tradenamesSilica Gel 100 and Geduran both are manufactured byE. Merck and Company and Grade 59 Silica Gel manufactured by the Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace . SilicaGel 100 and Geduran are obtainable in particle size of 0.210 to 0.500 mm Grade 59 Silica Gel is obtainable in a particle size of 2.38 to 5.6 mm amp must undergo size reduction and sieving. The aluminate ion can be furnished by using a water soluble aluminate or a source thereof in other words, the aluminate can be formed in situ . Preferred water soluble aluminate reactants are sodium aluminate and potassium aluminate. Aluminate is suitably formed in situ, for example, by reacting cationic aluminium e,g from aluminiumnitrate with sodium hydroxide, or by reacting aluminiummetal with sodium hydroxide. The reaction involving aluminate ion and silica gel is suitably carried out as follows Firstly, an aqueous solution of aluminate ion tor precursors thereof is contacted with selected silica gel. The amount of aluminate ionis selected to provide the desired ratio of surfnce silicon atoms to aluminium atoms. Reaction temperatures range, for example, from 15 C. to 100 C and reaction times range, for example, from 1 to 48 hours. In one.useful process, reaction is carried out at room temperature.In another useful process, boiling water 1000C. is used as the reaction medium. Reaction is carried out to obtain the desired surface al minaton. After the surface aluinination is completed, it is desirable to wash the product, e.g. with distilled water, to remove excess alumin iumsalts. Lam et al, cited above, suggest the following reaction equation EMI29.1 If the surface alumination reaction described above does not provide the proper cation substituents in the selected level, a cation exchange is carried out. The cation exchange to provide a selected level of cation substituents capable of forming Tr complexes is readily carried out by contacting the aluminated material with a sufficient amount of cation that is desired to be introduced. When it is desired to introduce silver substituents to provide cation substituents capable of forming Ir complexes, the exchange is carried out in aqueous medium. Suitable sources of silver include silver nitrate which is preferred and silver fluoride, silver chlorate and silver perchlorate. When the level of cation desired to be introduced is substantially less than 100 of exchange capacity, reaction is preferably carried out in a stirred tank and a slight excess of cation preferably 105 115 of stoichiometric is desirably used. When the level of cation desired to be introduced approaches 100 of exchange capacity, reaction is preferably carried out in a packed column and a large excess preferably 200t ö of stoichiometric is used. Unreacted cation is readily washed from the product. The moisture content is readily adjusted with conventional drying methods. For example, drying is readily carried out using vacuum or an oven e.g. a forced draft oven . Drying is carried out to obtain the desired moisture level, e.g., by drying at a temperature of 100 C. 1100C. for 15 20 hours. The particle size of the adsorbent is preferably adjusted by adjusting the particle size of the silica gel starting material, for example by sieving screening to obtain a narrow size distribution of particles within the aforedescribed range and by size reducing when such is appropriate. Particle size of adsorbent is readily controlled in this manner because particle size of the aluminated reaction product is essentially the same as that of the silica gel reactant. Less preferably, sieving or size reduction can be carried out on aluminated reaction product or even on reaction product subsequent to cation treatment. Turning now to the instant fractionation process, the selection of solvent s , the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminiumatoms in the adsorbent and level of cation substituents capable of forming X complexes are interrelated and depend on the separation desired to be obtained. The lower the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms in the adsorbent is, the greater the adsorbing power is. The higher the level of cation substituents capable of forming x complexes is, the greater the adsorbing power and the greater the resistance to desorption.The lower the solubility parameter ad solubility parameter polar and hydrogen bonding components of the solvent utilized as the dissolving phase during adsorption are, the more adsorbing power a particular adsorbent is able to exert.The higher the solubility parameter and the solubility parameter polar and hydrogen bonding components of the solvent utilized as the vehicle for desorption are, the more the desorbing power. The higher the degree of unsaturation and Iodine Value of the fraction desired to be separated is, the higher the solubility parameter and solubility parameter polar and hydrogen bounding components of the solvent that can be used for adsorbing and that is required for desorbing and the higher the ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminum atoms and the lower the level of cation substituents capable of forming IT complexes in the adsorbent that can be used for adsorbing and which will allow desorbing. When a particular adsorbent has been selected, the solvent used during adsorbing should have a solubility parameter and solubility parameter components sufficiently low to obtain selectivity, and the solvent used for desorbing should have a solubility parameter and solubility parameter components sufficiently high to obtain dosorption. When a particular solvent or particular solvents has have been selected, an adsorbent is selected with a ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms sufficiently low and a level of cation substituents capable of forming IT complexes sufficiently high to provide desired selectivity during adsorption and with a ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminum atoms sufficiently high and a level of cation substituents capable of forming Ir complexes sufficiently low to allow desorption of all or desired portion of adsorbed triglyceride during the desorbing step. We turn now to the conditions of temperature and pressure for the instant fractionation process. The.temperatures utilized during adsorbing and during desorbing generally range from .15 to. 200 C. A preferred temperature range to be used when the feed is a mixture of triglycerides having fatty acid moieties with aliphatic chains having from 12 to 20 carbon atoms, is 50 to 800C and temperatures as low as 40 C may provide an advantage especially when triunsaturated moiety is present. The pressures utilized during adsorbing and desorbing can be the same and generally are those pressures encountered in packed bed processing, e.g., ranging from atmospheric 50662 kPa. For a simulated moving bed process as described hereafter, the pressures utilized preferably range from 207 kPa to 827 kPa or are as prescribed by the desired flow rate. For a batch process, sufficient residence time should be provided to obtain appropriate yields and purities, usuall 15 minutes to 20 hours. The rates for continuous processing are a function of the size of the equipment, the resolving ability of the adsorbentsolvent pair, and the desired yield and purity. The fractionation process herein as described above provides a raffiate and an extract . The raffinate contains fraction which is enriched .in content of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value. It comprises triglyceride which was weakly attracted by the adsorbent, dissolved in solvent. The extract contains fraction enriched in content of triglycerde of higher Iodine Value. It comprises triglyceride which was more strongly attracted by the adsorbent, dissolved in solvent. The fractions of triglyceride can be recovered from the raffinate and from the extract by conventional separation processes such as by stripping solvent with heat, vacutun and or steam. We turn now to apparatus for a one solvent process herein and its operation. For batch processing, the one solvent process herein is readily carried out in equipment conventionally used for adsorptions carried out batch wise. For ewau tp e, sush processing can be carried out utilizing a column containing adsorbent and alternately a introducing feed dissolved in solvent to obtain selective adsorption and b introdlcing solvent to obtain desorption of adsorbed fraction. For continuous processing, the one solvent process herein is readily carried out in conventional continuous adsorbing apparatus and is preferably carried out by means of a sin ulated moving bed unit operation. A simulated moving bed unit operation and apparatus for such useful herein is described in Broughton et al U.S. PatentNo. 2,985,589. For a simulated moving bed embodiment of this invention, preferred apparatus includes a at least four columns connected in series, each containing a bed of adsorbent b liquid access lines communicating with an inlet line to the first column, with an outlet line from the last column, and with the connecting lines between successive columns c a recirculation loop including a variable speed pump, to provide communication between the outlet line from the last column and the inlet line to the first column and d means to regulate what flows in or out of each liquid access line. Such preferred simulated moving bed apparatus is operated so that liquid flow is in one direction and so that countercurrent flow of adsorbent is simulated by manipulation of what goes into and out of the liquid .access lines. In one embodiment, the apparatus is operated so that four functional zones are in operation.The first of the functional zones is usually referred to as the adsorption zone. This zone is downstream of a feed inflow and upstream of a raffinate outflow. In the adsorption zone, there is a net and selective adsorption of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value and a net desorption of solvent and of triglyceride of lowerIodine Value. The second of the functional zones is usually referred to as the purification zone. It is downstream of an extract outflow and upstream of the feed inflow and just upstream of the adsorption zone.In the purification zone, triglyceride of higherIodine Value which has previously been desorbed is preferentially adsorbed and there is a net desorption of solvent and of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value, The third of the functional zones is referred to as the desorption zone. It is downstream of a solvent inflow and upstream of extract outflow and just upstream of the purification zone, In the desorption zone, there is a net desorption of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value and a net adsorption of solvent. The fourth functional zone is usually referred to as the buffer zone. It is downstream of the raffinate outflow and upstream of the solvent inflow and just upstream of the desorption zone, In the buffer zoner triglyceride of lower IodineValue is adsorbed and solvent is desorbed.The various liquid access lines are utilized to provide the feed inflow between the purification and adsorption zones, the raffinate outflow between the adsorption and buffer zones, solvent inflow between the buffer and desorption zones and extract outflow between the desorption and purification zones, The liquid flow is manipt ted at predetermined time periods and the speed of the pump in the recirculation loop is varied concurrent with such manipulation so that the inlet points for feed and solvent and the outlet points for raffinate and extract are moved one position in the direction of liquid flow in a downstream direction thereby moving the aforedescribed zones in the direction of lic uid flow and simulating countercurrent flow of adsorbent. In another embodiment of simulated moving d operation, a plurality of successive desorption zones is utilized in place of a single desorption zone with solvent being introduced at the upstream end of each desorption zone and extract being taken off at the downstream end of each desorption zone. It may be advantageous to use different solvent inlet temperatures and or different solvents for different desorption zones. In another embodiment of simulated moving bed operation, raffinate is taken off at a plurality of.locations along the adsorption zone. Less preferred continuous simulated moving bed apparatus than described above is the same as the apparatus described above except that the recirculation loop is omitted. The buffer zone. can also be omitted. In the operation of the above described simulated moving bed processes, the relativc nuniher of columns in each zone to optimize a process can be selected based on selectivities and resolution revealed by pulse testing coupled with capacity and pul ity requirements.A factor in selecting the number of columns in the adsorption zone is the percentage of the feed to be adsorbed. The purity of the extract and raffinate streams is a function of the number of columns in the adsorption zone. The longer the adsorption zone is the more columns in it , that is, the further removed the feed inlet is from the raffinate outlet, the purer the raffinate is. In the operation of the above described simulated moving bed processes, the time interval between manipulations of liquid flow should be sufficient to allow a substantial proportion of triglyceride of higherIodine Value to stay in the adsorption zone and a substantial proportion of triglyceride of lower Iodine Value to leave. We turn now to apparatus for the two solvent process herein and its operation. Such two solvent process is preferably carried out using a column loaded with adsorbent. The feed and the solvent constituting the adsorption vehicle are run through the column until a desired amount of feed is adsorbed. Then, the desorbing solvent is run through the column to cause desorption of adsorbed material. Such two solvent process is less preferably carried out, for example, in a batch mixing tank containing the adsorbent. The feed together with solvent constituting the adsorption vehicle is added into the tank. Then mixing is carried out until a desired amount of adsorption occurs. Then TneIl li A is drained. Then desorbing solvent is added and mixing is carried out until the desired amount of desorption occurs. Then solvent containing the desorbed triglvcericie is drained. We turn now in more detail to the important process referred to earlier Involving sunflower oil. The feed is refined and bleached sunflower oil it contains from 9 to 12 by weight saturated fatty acid moiety palmitic acid moiety and stearic acid moiety on a methyl ester basis. The adsorbent for this process is that generally described above.Preferably the adsorbent is one derived from silica gel having a mean pore diameter of at least 15 x 10 10 metres and a surface area of at least 300 square metres per gram and is further characterized by a ratio of surface silicon to aluminium atoms ranging from 3 1 to 10 1, a level of silver cation substituents in a valence state of 1 ranging from O.lo millimoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area to 0.35 millimoles 100 square meters of adsorbent surface area with any remainder of cation substituents being sodium substituents, and a moisture content less than 4 by weight.The temperature used during adsorbing and during desorbing preferably ranges from 50 C to 80 C The processing is preferably carried out continuously in a one solvent process in a simulated moving bed unit operation as described above utilizing a pressure ranging from 205 kPa to 827 kPa or as prescribed by the desired flow rate. The solvent for a one solvent process is that generally described above for a one solvent process and preferably comprises ethyl acetate. The extract obtained contains triglyceride mixture containing less than 3.5 by weight saturated fatty acid moiety on a fatty methyl ester basis. Product recovered from the extract is suitable for a salad or cooking oil. We turn now in more detail to thn important process referred to earlier involving soybean oil feed.As indicated earlier the feed is soybean oil refined, bleached and deodorized soybean oil containing from 6.5 to 8.58 by weight linolenic acid soRety on a fatty methyl ester basis and having anIodine Value ranging from 130 to 150.. The adsorbent for this process is that generally described above.Preferably, the adsorbent is one derived from silica gel having a mean pore diameter of at least 75 x 10 10 metres and a surface area of at least 300 square metres per gram and is further characterized by a ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms ranging from 3 1 to 10 1, a level of silver cation substituents in a valence state of 1 ranging from 0.10 millimoles 100 square metres of adsorbent surface area told.35 millimoles 100 square metres of adsorbent surface area with any remainder of cation substituents being sodium substituents, and a moisture content less than 4 by weight.The temperature used during adsorbing and during desorbing preferably ranges from SO 0C to 80 C, and temperatures as low as 40 C can sometimes provide an advantage The processing is preferably carried out continuously in a one solvent process in a simulated moving bed unit operation as described above utilizing a pressure ranging from 207 kPa to 827 kPa or as prescribed by the desired flow rate.The solvent for a one solvent process is that generally described above for a one solvent process and preferably is ethyl acetate or a blend of ethyl acetate and hexane.The raffinate obtained contains triglyceride mixture containing from 0 to 5 linolenic acid moiety by weight on a fatty methyl ester basis and having anIodine Value ranging from 80 to 125. Product recovered from the raffinate is competitive with touch hardened soybean oil in relation to rancidity and odor problems and avoids entirely the problems associated with touch hardening of processing to remove nickel catalyst and hydrogenation odor and cis to trans isor..erization and double bond position changes, In other words, the product obtained from the process cf the invention contains no trans double bonds and no double bonds j n positions different from those in the feedstock.Fraction obtained from extract is an excellent drying oil. We turn now in more detail to the multistage processing referred to generally above Multistage processing can involve the f,ollowing, The feedstock to be separated is processed in a first stage to obtain first extract containixig fraction enriched compared to the feedstock in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value and first raffinate containing fraction enriched compared to the feedstockr in content of triglyceride oe lower Iodine Value and depleted completed to the feedstock in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value.The first raffinate or first extract, preferably the triglyceride fraction obtained by essentwally completely removing solvent from first raffinate or first extract, is pro cessed in the second stage to obtain second extract containing fraction enriched in content. of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value compared to the feed to tlie second stage and second raffinate enriched compared to the feed to the second stage in content of triglyceride of lower Iodine. Value and depleted cc rnpared to the feed to the second stage in content of triglyceride of higher Iodine Value.To the extent succeeding stages are used, each succeeding stage has as its feed rfinate or extract from the preceding stage, preferably triglyceride fraction obtained by essentially completely removing solvent from such. We turn now to advantages of the process herein. Significant advantages result from the chemical composition and structure of the adsorbent herein.Firstly, such adsorbent is made from materials which are readily commercially available in large amounts.Secondly, flexibility in adsorbent composition is readily provided in that silica gels with diffdrent pore sizes and surface areas are readily available and in that a predetermined ratio of surface silicon atoms to aluminium atoms is readily obtained. Thirdly, level of cations capable of forming X complexes can be readily regulated by selecting the ratio of surfacesilicon atoms to aluminium atoms. Fourthly, any cations capable of forming W complexes are situated at the surface of the adsorbent where such are available to provide adsorbing power thereby providing efficient usage of such cations e.g. silver . Furthermore, the process herein is characterized by a long adsorbent life cycle. Firstly, there is no problem of cations capable of forming s complexes being leached from the adsorbent as there is with silver nitrate treated silica gel adsorbents. This is because the cations are attached i the adsorbent by electrostatic interaction. Secondly, there is no fouling of the adsorbent with impurities. Thirdly, the adsorbent has physical strength such that it does not break down into smaller pieces. Furthermore, the adsorbent herein is advantageous over crystalline zeolite adsorbents from the standpoints oE flexibility and dynamic capacity and is.advantageous over resin adsorbents from the standpoints of flexibility, dynamic capacity, cost, and of being inorganic in nature. Moreover, processing is carried out without any significant amount of polymerization so that there is no problem of disposing of polymer by product. Furthermore, the process herein is carried out without the adsorbent handling and loss problems which can be associated with use of microparticulate particle size adsorbents. The invention is illustrated in the following specific,exsuples. In sample I below, a pulse test is run to determine the quality of separation that can be obtained in one solvent processing with selected adsorbent and solvent. The apparatus consists of a column having a length of 120 cm. and an inside diameter of 1 cm.and having inlet and outlet ports at its opposite ends. The adsorbent is dispersed in solvent and then introduced into the column. The column is packed with 100 cc of adsorbent on a wet packed basis.The column is in a temperature controlled environment.A constant flow pump if used to pump liquid through the column at a predetermined flow rate. In the conducting of the test, the adsorbent is allowed to come to equili brium with the solvent and feed by passing a mixture of the solvent and feed through the column for a predetermined period of time. The adsorbent is then flushed with solvent until a 5 milliliter fraction contains a negligible amount of feed. At this time, a pulse of feed containing a no amount of docosane tracer is injected, via a sample coil, into the solvent inflow. The pulse of feed plus tracer is thereby caused to flow through the column with components first being adsorbed by the adsorbent and then caused to be desorbed by the solvent.Equal volume effluent samples are collected, and triglyceride therefrom is converted to methyl ester which is analyzed by gas chromatography. From these analyses, elutionconcen tration curves for tracer and triglyceride components are obtained concentration in milligrams per milliliter is plotted on the y axis and elution volume in milliliters is plotted on the x axis . The distance from time zero the time when the pulse of feed plus tracer is introduced to the peak of a curve is the elution volume. The difference between the elution volume for a triglyceride component and the elution volume for the tracer is the retention volume of that triglyceride component. The relative selectivity of one triglyceride component over another is the ratio of their respect retention volumes. In Examples II IV, pilot plant test apparatus sometimes referred to as a demonstration unit is utilized. The apparatus is operated according to the continuous simulated moving bed unit operation mentioned above to carry out a one solvent process. The apparatus comprises columns which are connected in series in a loop to permit the process liquid to flow in one direction. Each column has a length of 610 mm and an inside diameter of22.9 mm and is load ed with 237 cc of adsorbent wet packed basis . Each column is equipped with four position valves top and bottom connected to four inlet and four outlet conduits. When a valve is closed, liquid flows only toward the column downstream of the valve.By selecting between the eight open positions four at top and four at bottom , feed can be caused to be introduced to the system e.g. position 1 , solvent can be caused to be introduced to the system e.g. position 2 , a raffinate stream can be removed from the system e.g. position 3 , an extract stream can be removed from the system e.g.position 4 or a solvent stream can be removed from the system e.g. position 5 . Backflow check positions are located in each of the bottom valves. These are used to isolate zones of the system from backfiow i.e., isolate the high pressure inlet solvent from the low pressure, outlet. Operation is as follows At any time, the apparatus constitutes a single stage. It is operated with four working zones adsorption, purification, desorption, and buffer . One backs low control valve is always in closed position to eliminate backflow between the solvent inlet and the low pressure outlet. No recirculation is used. The columns are apportioned between the adsorption, purification, desorption, and buffer zones with a selected number of columns in series comprising each zone.Feed is introduced into the first column of the adsorption zone and is dissolved in solvent and is contacted with adsorbent. As liquid flows downstream through the adsorption zone, triglyceride component s of higher Iodine Value is are selectively adsorbed leaving raffinate enriched in triglyceride of lower Iodine Value.In the purification zone, non adsorbed components are forced from the adsorbent and are thus forced downstream toward the feed point. The extract is removed at the inlet to the purification zone and is enriched in adsorbed components. The solvent is added at the inlet to the desorption zone and causes desorption of adsorbed component s from the adsorbent for removal downstream at the extract point. In the buffer zone, triglyceride is adsorbed and solvent is desorbed.A stream denoted herein ass a solvent outlet stream and consisting mostly of solvent is taken off at the outlet from the buffer zone. At selected intervals a controller advances the flow pattern into and out of columns one column in other words, the controller manipulates valves so that raffinate outflow, feed inflow, extract outflow, solvent inflow and solvent outflow points each advance one step, that is, to the next liquid access point in the direction of liquid flow to step forward to keep pace with the liquid flow. A cycle consists of the number of steps equal to the number of columns. The step time is chosen such as to allow the non adsorbed components to advance faster than the feed point and reach the raSfinate point The adsorbed triglyceride moves slower than the feed point and falls behind to the extract point. In Example V below, apparatus and operation are generally as described above for Examples II IV except that no buffer zone is used and there is no solvent outlet stream. In Example VI below, apparatus and operation are generally as described above for Examples II IV except that two desorption zones are used, one following the other, with solvent being introduced at the upstream end of each desorption zone and extract being removed at the downstream end of each desorption zone. Thus,Example VI is opera ted with five working zones i.e.an adsorption one, a purification zone, a first desorption zone, a second desorption zone and a buffer zone and with seven streams a feed introduction stream at the upstream end of the adsorption zone , a raffinate outlet stream at the downstream end of the adsorption zone, a solvent outlet stream at the downstream end of the buffer zone, a first solvent inlet stream at the upstream end of the first desorption zone, a first extractioutlet stream at the downstream end of the first desorption zone, a second solvent inlet streamat the upstream end of the second desorption zone, and a second extract outlet stream at the downstream end of the second desorption zone . In Example VII below, a test is run to demonstrate selection of solvents for a two solvent process once a particular adsorbent has been selected. The apparatus utilized is the same as that utilized in the run ofExample I, and as in Example I, the column is packed with 100 cc of adsorbent wet packed basis .The following procedure is utilized. A plurality of solvents is utilized successively, each being of progressively increasing desorbing power. The initial solvent is pumped through the column at 5 ml ntinute with the column temperature being 500C, 2,0 gms of feed 0.1 gram docosane tracer and 1.9 gms triglyceride mixture is dissolved in 10 ml. of the initial solvent.Flow through the column is stopped, and the 10 ml. of initial solvent with feed dissolved therein is injected into the column entrance. Flow of initial solvent is then restarted and effluent sample collection is begun. After approximately two column volumes of the initial solvent is pumped,5nfo the column, the solvent is changed and approximately two column volumes of the second solvent is pumped into the column. The solvent is successively changed after two column volumes of a solvent is pumped until all the solvents being tested have been pumped into the column. Eluant samples are collected, and the triglyceride therefrom is converted te methyl ester which is analyzed by gas chromatography. We turn now to the Examples I VIII which are generally described above. EXPtIPLE I The pulse consists of 0,5 ml solvent and 0.5 ml of triglyceride plus tracer. The triglyceride plus tracer consists by weight of 45 triolein, 45 trilinolein and 10 docosane tracer. The pulse is free of impurities which can foul the adsorbent.

The pH of the slurry is adjusted to 9.5 with 102 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.Then, a freshly prepared solution of sodium aluninate 108.6 gm in distilled water 2.0 liters is added.The slurry is stirred 10 hours at room temperature 20 C . Then stirring is stopped and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The resulting product is poured into a glass chromatographic column and trashed free of unreacted aluminata with distilled.water 1 2 ml per minute . Washing is continued until the pH of the effluent is 9.0. The solid is suction filtered to remove bulk water and then dried in a forced draft oven l05 ll0C. overnight. The solvent consists by volume of 80 hexane and 20 ethyl acetate. For this solvent blend 6 7.43, 6d 7.38, P 0.52 and a13 0.70. In the run, solvent is pumped continuously through the column at a rate of 6.2 ml per minute. At time zero, the sample pulse as described above is introduced by means of the ramp1e coil into the solvent flow, The equal. volume samples that are collected are each 6.2 ml one sample per minute . The run is carried out at SObC. Retention volumes are obtained as follows for triolein, 12.40 ml for trilinolein, 18.60 ml. The relative selectivity for trilinolein triolein is 1.50. The above indicates separation on the basis ofIodine Value. At the peak for trilinolein in the elution concentration curve, the percent purity is 68 trilin olein. This indicates resolution such that the use of multiple stages with the tested solvent and adsorbent combination in continuous simulated moving bed processing would be preferred and further indicates that silvered adsorbent would more appropriately be used.
