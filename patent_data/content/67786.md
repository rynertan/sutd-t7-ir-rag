# APPARATUS FOR HEATING THE CYLINDRICAL WALL OF A ROTARY CYLINDER OF A PAPER MAKING MACHINE

## Abstract
Apparatus for heating the cylindrical wall of a rotary cylinder of a paper making machine is described, in particu lar a drying cylinder for sheet paper in a machine of this type, including drive means for the cylinder operable to make it rotate with a predetermined speed of rotation, at least one magnetic flux generator device and means for supporting this device at a predetermined distance from the said cylinder the cylindrical side wall of the cylinder is made of a metal material and the said predetermined distance is chosen in such a way that the magnetic flux generated by the device intersects at least part of the side wall itself.
