# Communication system.

## Abstract
A communication system includes a plurality of reques tors and a plurality of responders representing resources. A protocol exercised by all elements provides accurate and consistent interconnection of all elements in a system where messages may be delayed or lost. Requestors are provided with means to transmit a request for use of a plurality of resources, respond to acceptances from one or more responders and create a cooperative relationship by trans mitting a confirmation to one responder and cancellation of the request to all other responders. Responders become committed to a requestor by signalling an acceptance to a request if a previous acceptance has not been transmitted, or if the resource is not already committed to another reques tor, and subsequent confirmation signal is received. The responder does not become committed after transmitting an acceptance if the next signal directed to it from the requestor is a request cancellation. Request signals and cancellation signals by a requestor can either be broadcast simultaneous ly to all responders of a class or transmitted to particular, designated responders, one at a time.
