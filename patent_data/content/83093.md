DETAILS OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns a process for preparing octaahydrobenzofuro 3,2 e isoquinoline analgesic and narcotic antagonistic compounds, I, which have the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is C C1 10 alkyl, CH2R6 or EMI3.2 R2 is H, OH or C1 12 alkoxy R3, R4 and R5 not illustrated in tahe formulae below are H R6 is C3 6 cycloalkyl, phenyl or 2 tetrahydrofuryl optionally substituted with a methyl group and R7 is H or C1 3 alkyl. The invention also resides in Compound s I in which R7 is H and in Compounds III to XI.Preparaton of Compounds I is illustrated by the following reaction scheme, wherein R1 is as defined above R2 is H or C1 12 alkoxy or, in CompoundXI, R2 may be OH R10 is C1 10 alkyl R11 is OH, C1 3 alkyl carbonyloxy, Cl, Br, I, p MeC6H4SO3 or MeSO3 R and R are H or C 1 3 alkyl and taken together may form a C2 5 alkylene group, optionally substituted with a methyl group, except that R12 and R13 may not both be H R14 is OH, Me3SiO or t BuMe2SiO R15 is C1 3 alkyl carbonyloxy or OCH R12 OR13, or, in Compounds IX and X, R15 may be R11, or, R11 or R14, respectively L is Cl, Br, I, p MeC6H4SO3 orMeSO3 and a is or ILLUSTRATIVE REACTION SCHEMEEMI5.1 EMI6.1 Alternatively, steps h and i can be replaced by h and i as follows EMI7.1 The invention also resides in several of the individual process steps a through i , including h and i . One embodiment concerns a process for preparing octahydrobenzofuro 3,2 el isoquinoline analgesic and narcotic antagonistic compounds comprising steps h and i in combination or singly. In combination, the process comprises cyclizing introduction of the furan ring and reducing the enamine double bond of Compound IX, a 4a ar.yl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8 octahydro 5 isoquinolinol or derivative thereof, e.g., acetate, to produceCompound I.This process may be carried out in any sequence, i.e., it may comprise h reducing the enamine double bond of the octahydro 5 isoquinolinol or derivative to yield a 4a aryldecahydro 5isoquinolinol or derivative thereof, e.g., CompoundX, and i cyclizing the latter compound to yield the desired henzofuroisoguinoline I or, it may comprise h cyclizing the octahydro 5 isoquinolinol or derivative to yield a 2,3,5,6,7,7a hexahydro lH benzofuro 3,2 e isoquinoline, i.e., Compound XI, and i reducing the enamine double bond of the latter compound to yield the desired benzofuroisoquinoline I. With reference to the illustrative scheme,Compound IX is reduced to Compound X in step h in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such asPtO2, which may be supported, in an alcohol or other inert solvent. This step is illustrated inExample 17. In step i , a furan ring is formed under basic conditions, as illustrated in Examples 18 and 23, or acidic conditions as illustrated in Example 19 to form Compound I. Under acidic conditions, the functional group, R15, can be used directly or after conversion to R14, i.e., hydroxy or silyl ether. Under basic conditions, the functional group,R15, if it is not C1 1 alkyl carbonyloxy, is first converted to R . The hydroxy functional group can be prepared by hydrolysis of R15. The silyl ethers can be prepared by treating the hydroxy derivative with a silyl chloride in the presence of base in an inert solvent. The sulfonate ester derivatives can be prepared directly from the hydroxy derivative as in step e .The halogen derivative can be prepared by treating the hydroxy derivative with a halogenating agent as in step e , or by displacing the sulfonate group of the sulfonate ester derivative. Conversion of Compound X to Compound I under acidic conditions is accomplished by treatment with a protic or Lewis acid in an inert or polar solvent atO to 100 C. This reaction will yield Compound I in which R2 is H or C 12 alkoxy. When R2is C1 12 alkoxy, it can be converted to H or OH by standard techniques. Under basic conditions, the conversion of step i is accomplished by treatment with a lower alkyl mercaptide salt of an alkali metal in a polar solvent at 50 to 2000C. This reaction will yieldCompound I in which. R is H or OH. When R2 is OH it can be converted to H or C1 12 alkoxy by known techniques. Preferably, the furan ring is formed using basic conditions in step i because better yields result. Under acidic conditions, e.g., Example 19, the yield of Compound I is about 108 whereas under basic conditions, e.g., Example 23, the yield is about 90 . In step h , the reduction of Compound IX B in which a is does not result in significant amounts of Compound X. Compounds IX A and .or IX B can be converted directly to compounds having a furan ring, the isoquinoline Compound XI, in which R2 is H or OH, under basic conditions, in reaction step h which is similar to the reaction described above in step i in which Compound X is converted toCompound I under basic conditions. This reaction results in higher yields of Compound XI from CompoundIX A than from Compound IX B. Compound XI can be reduced to Compound I in reaction step i which is similar to the reaction described above in step h in which Compound IX is reduced to Compound X. In this reaction, slight contamination of Compound XI with sulfur compounds from the mercaptide salt may retard the rate of reduction of the enamine double bond. To avoid this problem, the product mixture containing Compound XI may be treated with RaneyD nickel to remove any sulfur containing impurities. The isoquinolinol or derivative thereof used in steps h and h , illustrated as Compound IX, is prepared in step g by closing the 6 carbon ring of a 4 L 1 4 aryl l,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrid 4 yl l butanol derivative, e.g., acetate, by intramolecular reaction of the enamine and L. L is a leaving group and is defined above. With reference to the illustrative scheme, the reaction is effected by refluxing a solution ofCompound VIII A in which a is and or CompoundVIII B in which a is , in the presence of an organic or inorganic base, such as potassium carbonate, in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile. If the starting material is Compound VIII B, a reaction time of about 1 hour is important to obtain an optimum yield of Compound IX B. Shorter reaction times result in low conversion of starting material and longer reaction times result in low yield of Compound IX B. An iodide salt such as sodium or lithium iodide can be used to accelerate this reaction step. The latter is illustrated inExamples 15 and 16. The butanol derivative used in step g , illustrated as Compound VIII, is prepared in step f by opening the amino furan ring of a 5 aryl 6 t3 BJ Propyl 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 32.l octane. With reference to the scheme, in this step, the amino furan ring of Compounds VII A or VII B, or a hydrohalide salt thereof, is opened by treating the compound with a reagent that reacts at the oxygen of the furan ring to provide an oxygen functionality, and simultaneously liberates the enamine functionality, e.g., an anhydride of a lower alkyl carboxylic acid or an enol ether compound in the presence of a protic or Lewis acid at O to 1000C. The preferred starting material is the hydrohalide salt of Compound VII A since this compound can be used without liberating the free base. The hydrobromide is especially preferred for reasons of convenience. If Compound VII A is used, the reaction is preferably carried out at 70 to 800C if Compound VII B is used, the reaction is preferably carried out at ambient temperature. Examples of an anhydride and an acid which can be used in the reaction are acetic anhydride and trifluoroacetic acid examples of an enol ether are 2 methoxypropene and di hydropyr an see Examples 13 and 14. The 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 3. 2.l octane derivative used in step f , illustrated as CompoundVII, is prepared in step e by converting the alcohol moiety of a 5 aryl 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 3.2.lioctane 6 propanol to L. It is preferred that this step be carried out using Compound VI A because it is crystalline. L is introduced to the compound at the position occupied by the alcohol functionality. This step is illustrated in Examples 10 to 12. If a halogen leaving group is desired, a halogenating reagent such as a triphenylphosphinedihalogen complex in which the halogen is chlorine or bromine can be used. Such a halogenating agent can be prepared by treating triphenylphosphine with the halogen in an inert solvent. If a sulfonate leaving group is desired, the 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 3.2.l.ioctane 6 propanol, e.g.,Compound VI, can be treated with a sulfonyl chloride such as p toluenesulfonyl chloride or methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine or triethylamine or an inorganic base in an inert solvent at 30 to OOC. Alternatively, the 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 3.2.1. octane 6propanol can be treated with a lower alkyl sulfonate ester at 50 to 2000C. The sulfonate esters may be used in step f or may be converted to halides, such as by treatment with an alkali metal halide in an inert solvent, which can be used in step f . The 7 oxa 2 azabicyclo 3.2.1. 3octane 6 propanol used in step e , illustrated as CompoundVI, is prepared in step d by reducing the ketone moiety of a 1 4 aryl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrid 4 yl 4 hydroxy l butanone, illustrated asCompound V see Examples 6 to 9. The reduction can be effected by treatment with a complex aluminum hydride in an inert solvent or an alkali or alkaline earth metal in an alcohol solvent at 720C to the reflux temperature. The product, Compound VI, exists as two diastereomers,VI A, in which a is and VI B, in which a is . The relative amounts of the diastereomers depend upon the reducing reagent and upon the temperature. Compound VI A can be isolated in high purity from the product mixture by crystallizing its hydrochloride salt which is produced by treating a solution of the product mixture, preferably in ether or methanol, with hydrogen chloride. The resulting mother liquor contains Compounds VI B and VI A. The hydrochloride salt of Compound VI A may be used in step e or may be treated with base, such as a sodium carbonate solution, to form the free base,Compound VI A. The preferred method for the preparation ofCompound VI B is to effect the reduction at 720C with lithium aluminum hydride. The butanone derivative used in step d is prepared in steps a , b and c which comprise a contacting and reacting a lithiated anisole or alkyl phenyl ether, optionally substituted at the 3 position relative to the lithium atom, with a 4 piperidone to yield a 4 aryl 4 piperidinol b dehydrating the piperidinol to a 4 aryl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine and, c metalating and acylating the 4 aryl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine. Following is a further description of these three steps Step a Step a is a Grignard reaction. This step is illustrated in Examples 1 and 2. The reaction is typically carried out at O to 250C, although temperatures as low as about 780C may be used, in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, for about 1 to 12 hours, usually about 3 hours. The resulting Compound III can be isolated by known techniques such as crystallization as in Example 1 or removal of unreacted starting materials under vacuum as in Example 2. Lithiated anisoles or alkyl phenyl ethers can be prepared by treating the corresponding aryl ethers with a C 1 8 alkyl lithium compound in an inert solvent at 72 to 250C, or by metal halogen exchange of a compound which is substituted with halogen at a position adjacent the ether functionality by treatment with a C 1 8 alkyl lithium compound in an inert solvent. Step b Step b is a dehydration reaction. This step is illustrated in Examples 3 and 4. This reaction is preferably carried out in a strong acid at about 45 to 650C for about 3 hours.The use of higher temperatures results in undesirable side products. The above cited references suggest that a dehydrating agent, e.g., phosphorus pentoxide and methanesulfonic acid, may be employed. Step c Step c involves metalation followed by acylation. This step is illustrated inExample 5. The metalation may be effected by treatment with a C 1 8 alkyl lithium compound such as n butyl lithium in an inert solvent at 72 to OOC, preferably 100C, to form the carbanion. The acylation may be effected by adding the anion to a solution of W butyrolactone in an inert solvent at 72 to 0 C. The resulting keto alcohol may be isolated by treatment with a basic hydroxide in an alcohol solvent as in Example 5 or it may be used in step d without isolation as in Example 6. Other useful derivatives of Compound I can be prepared by converting the substituents by known techniques. These include the derivatives in which EMI14.1 2 f uryl, optionally substituted R7 is OCH or C1, Br or F and 93 R8 and R9 are, independently, H, CH3 or C1. The derivative in which R5 is OH may be prepared by hydroborating the enamine double bond with borane or its derivatives followed by basic peroxide oxidation of the resulting borane. The acetoxy and methoxy derivatives are prepared therefrom by known techniques. EXAMPLES The following Examples illustrate the invention.
