# Method and apparatus for flanging tubular polymer articles.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for flanging a tubular article of a crystallisable thermoplastic polymer, par ticularly of a saturated linear polyester material such as polyethylene terephthalate, which has been heat set to an elevated temperature, e.g. for producing bodies for process able food and beverage containers. The open end 12 of the tubular body is applied to a fianging die 20 and heated to a flanging temperature above the glass transistion temperature but below the heat set temperature of the polymer. The tubu lar body 10 and the die 20 are forced together so that the softened end of the tubular article is forced to move outwards until it abuts against a stop ring 23 to form the flange 11 . The residual shrinkage in the polymer material helps it to take up the precise contours of the die and to form a well defined flange. The flanged end is then cooled, preferably to a temp erature at least 20 C below the flanging temperature, before releasing the tubular body 10 from the die 20 .
