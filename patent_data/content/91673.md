# Baghouse filter assembly.

## Abstract
A baghouse filter 21 having a filter chamber divided by a partition 25 into the clean gas side and the dirty gas side. The partition has a plurality of apertures, in each of which is mounted a filter unit 26 for removal and replacement. The housing has an access opening 27 to permit access to the interior of the housing and the opening is sufficiently large to permit withdrawal of the partition 25 from the housing for replacement of the filter units. Preferably, the partition of the housing is mounted on a door 24 closing the access opening, so that displacement of the access door from the housing automatically displaces the partition from the housing to permit removal and replacement of the filter units. Improved filter unit assemblies permit mounting of the filter units from the dirty gas side of the partition with suitable sealing means to prevent unfiltered gaseous medium bypassing the filter units.
