# SUPPORT PARTICLES COATED WITH PRECURSORS BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE GLASS

## Abstract
An aqueous solution of precursors for biologically active glass, support particles coated with the solution, support particles coated with the glass, spheroidal particles of biologically active glass, processes for making the solution, coating the support, and for making the coated support and the spheroidal glass particles. The materials that comprise the biologically active glass are useful in prosthetic devices and implants for the human body.
