# Optical recording and reproducing device.

## Abstract
A laser light flux is divided and synthesized so that its light intensity distribution is changed from a Gaussian distribution to a non Gaussian distribution. When a laser light flux L₀ hav ing a Gaussian distribution is irradiated onto a dividing prism 1 , it is divided into a left part l₁ and a right part l₂ which are refracted right and left invensely from each other. When the right and left parts l₁, l₂ are incident on a synthesizing prism, they are refracted again and travel to be overlapped with each other on a recording medium. The light intensity distribution on a segment dd at the apex of the synthesizing prism is weaker at the central part and stronger at the peripheral part. This is because the light fluxes resulting from the division are inverted in their position so that the central part of the Gaus sian distribution is separated left and right while the peripheral part with a weaker light intensity is centered.
