# Push in closures.

## Abstract
A push in easy opening closure for a can end 1 or similar container member formed with a resealable pressure releas ing tab 4 closing an opening 5 in the can end 1 and integrally connected to the can end 1 at integral connection 6 . The tab 4 is adapted to be bent about the integral connec tion 6 during the opening operation, and to avoid sheet metal fracture at the integral connection 6 , the radius about which the tab 4 will bend in the region of the connection 6 is artificially increased by some convenient means. In a first embodiment a raised dimple 7 is formed centrally of the integral connection 6 .
