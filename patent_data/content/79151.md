# Ceramic, cermet or metal composites.

## Abstract
This invention relates to nitrides, oxides, arsenides, borides, phosphides, tellurides, titanates, silicides, carbides, etc. of metals or metalloids, as such or in their compacted forms, as substrates or base elements. These can be readily joined with various other substrates employing as a coating, film, layer or interlayer former a tin, lead, indium, or alloys thereof, in an admixture with a carbide or carbonyl former and joining the substrate or base in a carbon monoxide atmosphere with the coating, etc. former. Also described are highly adhesive composites with an active tin alloy which are obtained as coating on beryllia by depositing tin with, e.g. vanadium on beryllia, and heating in a carbon monoxide atmosphere of up to 1000 C.
