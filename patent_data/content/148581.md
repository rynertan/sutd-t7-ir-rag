# High solid coatings.

## Abstract
An improved method is provided for preparing low molecular weight acrylic copolymer resins useful as components in high solids acrylic coatings suitable for electrostatic spraying in which the polymerization solvent comprises an alkanoic acid alkyl ester having a total of from about 7 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. The monomers can comprise hydroxy substituted alkyl meth ac rylates, and non hydroxy substituted alkyl meth acrylates. The polymerization solvent can remain in the resin to become the solvent employed in the higher solids coating containing the thus formed acrylic resins and provides surprisingly improved electri cal resistivity and solvency and decreased surface tensions over prior art polymerization solvents.
