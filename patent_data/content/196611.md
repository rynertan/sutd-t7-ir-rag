# Debris retaining trap for a fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a debris trap for capturing and retaining debris entrained in liquid coolant flowing into a nuclear fuel assembly through flow holes in an adapter plate of a fuel assembly end nozzle. The debris trap comprises a hollow enclosure 46 which is formed of a material permeable to the liquid coolant and impermeable to debris entrained therein, is disposed, when in use, adjacent said adapter plate 34 upstream thereof, and has in its upstream wall 50 at least one inlet opening 74 large enough to permit debris entrained in the liquid coolant to enter the enclosure a debris retaining means 76 round said inlet opening for preventing entered debris from exiting through the inlet opening and a flow distributing means 84 extending downstream of the inlet opening and the debris retaining means for effecting substantially uniform distribu tion of the exiting liquid coolant across the adapter plate.
