# System for selecting address in input output board.

## Abstract
A method of selecting a desired address in plurality of input output boards 10 to 12 connected to common buses 6 in an input output interface unit 1 which is connected to a main control unit 6 through a serial data transmission system. A programmable address converter circuit 5 is provided which generates slot selection signals s1 to s16 and an in board address BA from an address for accessing the input output boards which is output from a control circuit 2 in the input output interface unit 1 . One of the input output boards 10 to 12 is selected by the slot selection signals s1 to s16 , and one of the addresses in the selected input output board is selected by the in board address BA .
