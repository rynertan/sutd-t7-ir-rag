# Three dimensional interstitial catalyst supports, its manufacture and use.

## Abstract
A three dimensional interstitial catalyst support and a catalyst system comprising the support for use in especially pressure sensitive surface reactions involving disturbed fluid flow, especially trickle feed three phase reactions such as the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde or butyraldehyde. The support comprises a three dimensional self supporting form stable interstitial preferably knitted wire 11, 23 structure 5,20 in which the volume of the interstices 4a, 9a, 25, 26 is from 60 to 98 preferably at least 85 of the volume of the structure 5, 20 . The combination of the use of wire, form stability and an open structure allows disturbance to be imparted by the catalyst system with less risk of blockages, flooding or damage by attrition and hence less need to increase pressure during a reaction which is undesirable in pressure sensitive reactions. Also a method for making the structures 5, 20 by rolling up wire cloth 1 , compressing it to the pre determined volume and annealing. Also the use of the catalysts in disturbed fluid solid cataly sed reactions.
