## Description
The present invention relates to an oxide semiconductors far thermistors adapted for use mainly in a temperature range of 200 500 C. Heretofore, thermistors comprising oxide of Mn and Co as their main components have been widely used. They include compositions of Mn Co system oxide, Mn Co Cu system oxide Mn Co Ni system oxide and Mn Co Ni Cu system oxide, which have been used as general purpose disc shape thermistors for such applications as temperature compensation, etc. These thermistors give, as a characteristic of such materials, specific resistances from ten and several Ω cm to one hundred and several tens kΩ cm for use mainly in a temperature range from 40 C to 150 C. However, demand for their use as temperature sensors has recently grown larger thus, thermistor sensors which are usable at higher temperature have been in demand. As a first step, a demand has been raised for thermistor sensors which are usable at temperature up to 300 C for temperature control of petroleum combustion equipment. In order to deal with this situation, materials with high specific resistances have been taken up as materials of thermistors in the place of conventional materials comprising oxide of Co Mn as their main components and until now Mn Ni Al system oxide semiconductors Japanese Patent Gazette Patent Laid Open No. Sho 57 956O3 and Mn Ni Cr Zr system oxide semiconductors specification of U.S. Patent No. 4,324,702 offered by the present inventors have been put into practical use. With regard to the construction of the sensor, sloughing conventional structure of the disc shape thermistor molded of resin, the object of shielding it. from high temperature atmosphere has been attained by sealing a thermistor element of such a very minute size as 500 µn, x 500 µm x 300 µm t in a glass tube or fly coating glass on the thermistor element fly way of dipping. On the other hand, just as the disc shape thermistors, bead shape thermistors have been improved in heat resistance by glass coating. However, a demand for thermistor sensors which are usable at still higher temperatures have not been abated, there being strong demands for sensors which permit uses at such temperatures as above 300 C, 500 C or up to 700 C. These demands can not be met with the conventioned materials because of the following two problems involved Thus 1 their specific resistances, being one of characteristics of thermistor materials, are low that is, resistances required for operation of equipment at intended temperatures can not be obtained, and another one, 2 they lack in reliability, because their resistance change with time at high temperatures exceeding the required 5 500 C, 1000 Hr .
