Lower alkanoyl is a straight or branched 0IIC alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain as defined above. The term band the NE in the Formula IIB is attached to either one or the other of the adjacent carbons meansEMI3.1 The compounds of Formula I are useful both in the free base form and in the form of acid addition salts.Both forms are within the scope of the invention. In practice, use of the salt form amounts to use of the base form. Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid and organic acids such as ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, and the like, giving the hydrochloride, sulfamate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, and the like respectively. The acid addition salts of said basic compounds are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric carbon atoms. The invention includes the individual diastereomers, the pure S, the pure R isomer, and mixtures thereof. The individual diastereomers may be prepared or isolated by methods known in the art. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect either the N or O of intermediates in the above noted process with suitable protecting groups which are known. Introduction and removal of such suitable oxygen and nitrogen protecting groups are well known in the art of organic chemistry see for example, 1 Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J. F. W. McOmie, ed., New York, 1973 , pp 43ff, 95ff 2 J. F. W. McOmie, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, 191 281 1963 3 R. A.Borssonas, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, 159 190 1963 and 4 J. F. W. McOmie, Chew. BR Ind., 603 1979 . Examples of suitable oxygen protecting groups are benzyl, t butyldimethylsilyl, methyl, isopropyl, ethyl, tertiary butyl, ethoxyethyl, and the like. Protection of an N B containing moiety is necessary for some of the processes described herein for the preparation of compounds of this invention. Suitable nitrogen protecting groups are benzyl, triphenylmethyl, trialkylsilyl, trichloroethylcarbamate, trichloroethoxycarbonyl, vinyloxycarbamate, and the like. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect two different oxygens with dissimilar protecting groups such that one can be selectively removed while leaving the other in place. The benzyl and t butyldimethylsilyl groups are used in this way either is removable in the presence of the other, benzyl being removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis, and t butyldimethylsilyl being removed by reaction with, for example, tetra n butylammonium fluoride. In the process described herein for the preparation of compounds of this invention the reguirements for protective groups are generally well recognized by one skilled in the art of organic chemistry, and accordingly the use of appropriate protecting groups is necessarily implied by the processes of the charts herein, although not expressly illustrated. The products of the reactions described herein are isolated by conventional means such as extraction, distillation, chromatography, and the like. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a compound of Formula I wherein R1 is ofFormula IIA NH is either endo or exo A, B, C,D, and E are all hydrogen R2 is hydrogen, R6 is chloro and , and R3 are as defined above. A particular embodiment includes N6 endo bicyclo 12.2.liheptyladenosine, N exo bicycloj2.2.l heptyladenosine, and N6 endo bicyclot2.2.1 heptyl 5 chloroadenosine. The N6 endo bicyclot2.2.1 heptyl 5 chloroadenosine is the most preferred embodiment. The compounds of Formula I may be conveniently synthesized by reacting a 6 halopurine riboside ofFormula III with bicyclo amine of Formula IVA or IVB as shown hereinafter where A, B, C, D, E, and X is as defined above in an inert solvent such as alcohol, or an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide between about 25 to about 1300C for from 1 48 hours. The bicyclo amines of Formula TVA or Formula IVB above are commercially available, may be made by known methods or may be made by methods analogous to those known in the art. It is useful to add a base such as triethylamine, or calcium carbonate to neutralize the hydrogen halide formed as a byproduct of the reaction, but this can also be accomplished by using an extra equivalent of the alkylamine.It is also convenient, although not necessary, to protect the ribofuranose hydroxyl groups as acetate or benzoate esters which can be removed with ammonium hydroxide or sodium methoxide following the synthesis of theN6 substituted adenosine. The reaction is illustrated as follows EMI6.1 wherein Hal is halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, and A, B, C, D, E, R2, R2 , R3 , and Rg are as defined for Formula I. In addition, compounds of Formula I wherein R6 is halogen may also be prepared from a compoundFormula I where R6 is Rug 0 where R2 , R3 , and R are all hydrogen, in a stepwise manner, by first reacting with the compound to form a protecting group for the oxygen of OR2 and OR3 , i.e., where R2 and R3 are other than hydrogen, e.g., dimethoxy propane, in acetone to give a compound of Formula I having protected groups followed by chlorinating the 5 hydroxymethyl using thionyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran, and removing the protecting group under aqueous acid condition using acids, for example, hydrochloric, acetic, sulfuric, and the like as illustrated below.EMI7.1 In addition, compounds of Formula I wherein R2 is other than hydrogen or halogen, may also be prepared from 2,6 dichloropurine riboside triacetate of Formula V in a stepwise manner, by first reacting a compound of the Formula V with bicycloamine of Formula IVa or IVb to give a compound ofFormula VI, followed by replacing the chlorine atom atC2 with the group R2 using nucleophilic displacement conditions, and removing a protecting group, i.e., the acetate, as illustrated below. EMI8.1 The compounds of Formula I wherein R6 is hydrogen are prepared according to the following scheme EMI8.2 Generally the conditions of the above scheme are analogous to those known in the art. The compounds of Formula I have been found to possess differing affinities for adenosine receptors designated A1 and A2 receptors for convenience .These compounds are active in animal tests as having analgesic properties and as such, are useful in the treatment of pain and inflammation. PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION Adenosine Receptor Binding A1 Receptor Affinity RBA1 Preparation of Membranes Whole brain minus cerebellum and brainstem from male Long Evans rats 150 200 g was homogenized in 30 volumes of ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 using a Brinkman Polytron PT 10, setting number 6 for 20 seconds and centrifuged for ten minutes at 20,000 x g Sorvall RC 2 , 4 C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and centrifuged as before. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml Tris HCl buffer containing two InternationalUnits ml of adenosine deaminase Sigma type III from. calf intestinal mucosa , incubated at 370C for 30 minutes, then subsequently at DOC for ten minutes.The homogenate was again centrifuged, and the final pellet was resuspended in ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 to a concentration of 20 mg ml original wet tissue weight and used immediately. Assay Conditions Tissue homogenate 10 mg ml was incubated in 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 1.0 nH 3H N6 cyclohexyladenosine 3H CHA with or without test agents in triplicate for one hour at 25 C. Incubation volume was 2 ml. Unbound 3B CHA was separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman glass fiber GF B filters.The filters were rinsed three times with 5 ml of ice cold 0.05 M Tris BCl buffer pB 7.7. The radiolabeled ligand retained on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry after shaking the filters for one hour or longer on a mechanical shaker in 10 ml of Beckman Ready Solv HP scintillation cocktail.Calculations Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding which occurred in the presence of 1 mM. theophylline.The concentration of test agent which inhibited 50 of the specific binding ICso was determined by nonlinear computer curve fit. The Scatchard plot was calculated by linear regression of the line obtained by plotting the amount of radioligand bound pmoles gram of tissue versus I bound radioligand free free radioligand . Since the amount of radioligand bound was a small fraction of the total amount added, free radioligand was defined as the concentration nM of radioligand added to the incubation mixture. The Hill coefficient was calculated by linear regression of the line obtained by plotting the log of the bound radioligand vs the bound radioliaand log of the Bmax bound radioligand The maximal number of binding sites wax was calculated from the Scatchard plot. Adenosine Receptor Binding A2 Receptor Affinity RBA2 Tissue Preparation Brains from 200 500 g mixed sex Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Pel Freez Rogers, Arkansas .Fresh brains from male Long Evans hooded rats BlueSpruce Farms, Altamont, NY gave essentially identical results. Brains were thawed and then kept on ice while the striata were dissected out. Striata were disrupted in 10 vol of ice cold 50 mv Tris HCl pE 7.7 at 250C, pH 8.26 at 5 C Tris for 30 seconds in a Polytron PT 10 Brinkmann at setting 5. The suspensicn was centrifuged at 50,000 xg for ten minutes, the supernatant discarded, the pellet resuspended in 10 vol ice cold Tris as above, recentrifuged, resuspended at 1 9 5 ml, and stored in plastic vials at 700C stable for at least six months . When needed, tissue was thawed at room temperature, disrupted in a Polytron, and kept on ice until used.Incubation Conditions All incubations were for 60 minutes at 250C in 12x75 mm glass tubes containing 1 ml Tris with 5 m original tissue weight of rat weight of rat striatal membranes, 4 nM I3H N ethyl adenosine 51 carboxamide 3H NECA , 50 nM N6 cyclopentylaoenosine to eliminate A1 receptor binding , 10 ma, MgC12, 0.1 units ml of adenosine deaminase and 18 dimethylsulfoxide. N6 Cyclopentyladenosine was dissolved at 10 mM in 0.02 N HC1 and diluted in Tris. Stock solutions and dilutions of N6 cyclopentyladenosine could be stored at 200C for several months. Test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide on the same day as the experiment, and diluted in dimethylsulfoxide to 100x the final incubation concentration. Control incubations received an equal volume 10 p1 of dimethylsulfoxide the resulting concentration of dimethylsulfoxide had no effect on binding. 3H NECA was diluted to 40 nM in Tris. The membrane suspension 5 mg 0.79 ml contained sufficient Mac12 and adenosine deaminase to give 10 mM and 0.1 units ml, respectively, final concentration in the incubation.For test compounds with TCso values less than 1 1 pM, the order of additions was test compound 10 1 , N6 cyclopentyladenosine 100 ul , 3B NECA 100 ill , and membranes 0.79 ml . For test compounds with IC50 values greater than 1 uM and limited water solubility, the order of additions same volumes was test compound, membranes,N6 cyclopentyladenosine, and 3H NECA. After all additions, the rack of tubes was vortexed, and the tubes were then incubated for 60 min at 250C in a shaking water bath. The rack of tubes was vortexed an additional time halfway through the incubation. Incubations were terminated by filtration through 2.4 cm GF B filters under reduced pressure. Each tube was filtered as follows the contents of the tube were poured onto the filter, 4 ml of ice cold Tris were added to the tube and the contents poured onto the filter, and the filter was washed twice with 4 ml of ice cold Tris. The filtration was complete in about twelve seconds. Filters were put in scintillation vials, 8 ml of Formula 947 scintillation fluid added, and the vials left overnight, shaken, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter at 40 efficiency. Data Analysis Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 100 N6 cyclopentyladenosine, and specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. The IC50 was calculated by weighted nonlinear least squares curve fitting to the mass action equation. Y T S D D K where Y is cpm bound T is cpm total binding without drug S is cpm specific binding without drug D is the concentration of drug and K is the IC50 of the drugWeighting factors were calculated under the assumption that the standard deviation was proportional to the predicted value of Y. Nonspecific binding was treated as a very large infinite concentration of drug in the computer analysis. The IC50 values nM for adenosine A1 andA2 receptor affinity are reported in the table. ANALGESIC EVALUATION The antiwrithing AW test provides preliminary assessment of compounds with potential analgesic activity. The test is performed in male Swiss Webster mice. Compounds are administered subcutaneously in aqueous 0.28 methylcellulose or other appropriate vehicles in volumes of 10 ml kg. Dosages represent active moiety. Acetic acid 0.6 , 10 ml kg is injected intraperitoneally 20 minutes after administration of the adenosine agonist. Writhing movements are counted for five minutes starting seven minutes after the acetic acid injection. Writhing is defined as abdominal constriction and stretching of the body and hind legs with concave arching of the back.Data are expressed as ED50 values, where theED50 is the dose necessary to suppress writhing by 50 relative to vehicle controls. ED50 values are calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. ANTIINFLAMMATORY ASSAY Assessment of immunoinflammatory or antiinflammatory activity is provided by the carrageenan pleurisy assay. Carrageenan pleurisy is induced as previously described by Carter, G. w., et al., inJ. Pharm. Pharniacol 34 66 67, 1982. Carrageenan 310 Pg rat is injected intrapleurally in a 0.25 ml volume of pyrogen free saline. Four hours later, the rats are sacrificed and 2 ml of a phenol red solution 325 mg phenol red in 1 liter of 0.05 M phosphate buffered saline are added to each pleural cavity.The contents of the cavities are mixed and transferred to glass test tubes. A 50 1 aliquot is removed from each tube and exudate cells are counted after red blood cells lysis with Zapoglobin CoulterElectronics, Rialeah FL using a Coulter model ZBI counter. The remaining exudate phenol red mixture is centrifuged at 750 xg for 15 minutes. One hundred p1 of the supernatent fluid is diluted with 3.9 ml of phosphate buffer 0.072 M of tribasic sodium phosphate, Na3PO4 12H20 in water and the absorbance is measured at 560 nm. Exudate volume is calculated as follows V1 V 2 A2 A3 A3 A1 where V1 unknown volume of exudate, V2 volume of dye added to cavity 2 ml , A1 s absorbance of exudate assumed to be zero , A2 absorbance of the phenol red solution, A3 absorbance of exudate and phenol red solution. Inhibition of exudate or formation is calculated by the following equations inhibition exudate Vehicle Exdate Volume Inhibitor Exudate Vehicle Exudate Volume X 100 inhibition cell count Vehicle Cell Count Inhibitor Cell Count x 100 Vehicle Cell CountID50 values are calculated by Probit analysis.

For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solublizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound.In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 or 10 to about 70 percent of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term preparation is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous i ure is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions1 suspensions, and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternately, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion to liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form preparation as with a syringe, teaspoon, or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature i.e., under refrigeration in order to retard possible decomposition.The solid form ptEparations intended to be converted to liquid worm may contain, in addition to the active material, flavorants, colorants, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. The liquid utilized for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol, and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the liquid utilized will be chosen with regard to the route of administration, for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral use. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparaticn is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 500 mg preferably to 5 to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. The compositions can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. In therapeutic use as described above, the mammalian dosage range for a 70 kg subject is from 0.1 to 150 mg kg of body weight per day or preferably 1 to 50 mg kg of body weight per day. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed.Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The following Examples further illustrate the invention.
