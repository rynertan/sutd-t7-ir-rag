# Ceramic substrate for a thin layer magnetic head.

## Abstract
A ceramic substrate for a thin layer magnetic head con sists essentially of 100 weight parts of composite ceramics and 0.05 to 5 weight parts of silicon oxide or iron oxide, the composite ceramics containing 20 to 55 weight of titani um carbide and the balance being substantially aluminum oxide. Such a ceramic substrate can be made to have a very high relative density of more than 99 , caused by a high bonding strength in combination with a small average crys tal particle diameter of about 1 Âµm or less. A high resistance is thereby achieved with respect to shocks as occur during start and stop of a magnetic disk when the magnetic head touches the disk.
