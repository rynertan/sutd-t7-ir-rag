# Capacitive gauge.

## Abstract
Gauge comprising at least one capacitor for connec tion into a bridge circuit, said capacitor having at least one of its electrode support plates coated with an electrode overlay 22 such that a system of sub electrodes 23, 28, 29 is formed, said subelectrodes 23, 28, 29 mutually separated at least by gaps 21, 25 but even if in geometri cal respect the gaps are the only separation between sub electrodes, yet they are connected in the bridge circuit such that each sub electrode 28a, b in the activated state is surrounded by subelectrodes 29a, b acting as guard elements. In combination with the other, opposite electrode plate 20 , wheter or not subdivided in sub electrodes, there may be formed a capacitor C₁, C₂ of the plate type or of the cross type. A capacitor C₁ thus formed can cooperate with a similar capacitor ₂ said pair of capacitors offering the possibility to measure any deviation in the parallelity bet ween two surfaces or in the angular coincidence. Accuracies are obtained of 1 10⁶ or better.
