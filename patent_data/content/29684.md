# Method of producing a decaffeinated coffee product.

## Abstract
A lower grade green coffee bean fraction is moisturized to above 37 by weight and then decaffeinated by extraction with a moist supercritical fluid having a temperature of at least 100 C. This decaffeinated coffee is then combined, either before or after roasting, with a higher grade coffee fraction. Typically the higher grade fraction will be coffee which has been decaffeinated by extraction with a moist supercritical fluid at a temperature below about 85 C.
