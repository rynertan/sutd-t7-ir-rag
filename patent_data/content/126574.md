# Plant waterer.

## Abstract
A portable plant waterer comprises a vessel 10 for con taining water and having a filler cap 11 which combines with the vessel to form a figurine which is aesthetically appealing. A hollow conical spike 12 on the underside of the vessel is adapted for insertion into the soil 13 around a plant and sup ports or at least stabilizes the vessel. An outlet in the bottom of the vessel communicates with the inside of the spike 12 and a tube 14 in the vessel extends from above the normal water level to the outlet in sealing engagement therewith such that water is prevented from escaping from the outlet other than via a wick 15 which extends from below the water level to the soil, via the tube 14 , the spike 12 and a hole in the bot tom of the spike 12 . The wick 15 draws water from the ves sel and maintains the soil around a plant in a moist condition.

## Description
PLANT WATERER This invention relates to a plant waterer and in particular to a self contained moveable plant waterer adapted to provide a continuous slow supply of water to a plant over an extended period of time. The invention is particularly adapted for use with plant pots and is most suitable for indoor plants. Many different forms of plant waterers of the general kind in question are known and one form uses a wick to draw water from an outer bowl which surrounds the underside of a plant pot, into the soil surrounding the plant. Such arrangements work quite satisfactorily in enabling the slant to be left for extended periods without attention merely by filling the outer bowl with water via a filling tube which extends upwardly through the inner or plant containing bowl.The outer bowl holds sufficient water to last for two or more weeks at the rate the water is drawn, via the wick, into the soil. However, such arrangements are relatively expensive compared to conventional plant pots and provide limited choice of plant pot. Furthermore, the pot is confined to use with the particular plant therein and thus there is no versatility in so far as being able to use the device with other plant pots or even outdoor plants which are not in pots. Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide an imDroved plant waterer of a portable type which mav be readily moved from one plant to another to supply water to the plant over an extended period. Thus the invention provides a portable plant waterer comprising a storaae vessel adapted to be filled with water and having means for supporting said vessel in a position generally above the soil surrounding a plant, said vessel having a waterproof tube extending from within the vessel at a point above the normal water level to an outlet in the vessel wall in sealing engagement with the vessel wall, and a wick extendina from within said vessel at the lowermostDoint in use, through said tube to the outside of said vessel whereby water in the vessel may be delivered by said wick to said soil. In order that the invention may be more readilv understood one particular embodiment will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawinqs, wherein Fig. 1 is a sectional front elevation of a plant waterer according to the invention, and Fig. 2 is a front elevation of the plant waterer shown in Fig. t. The plant waterer is shown to comprise a plastic vessel 10 havinq a removable cap 11 which together with the vessel forms a figurine which may take many differing forms. The cap 11 may be a screw cap or, as in this embodiment, a press type cap which clips over a rim around the top edge of the vessel 10. The top 11 enables the vessel to be filled with water and also prevents loss of water by evaporation.The top has an air hole 19 to allow a small passage of air into the vessel as the water is used. The vessel has a downwardly projecting spike 12 which is arranged on the underside of the vessel for the purpose of supportinq the vessel above soil 13 surrounding a plant as shown in Fig. 2.In soft soil the spike 12 may penetrate to a point where the bottom of the vessel bears on the soil whereas in hard soil the tapering shape of the spike 12 may prevent complete insertion of the spike into the soil and thus the vessel 10 would be supported above the surface of the soil. A plastic tube 14 extends upwardly inside the vessel 10 from the bottom of the vessel to a point above the normal water level. The plastic tube 14 is in sealinq enqagement with the bottom of the vessel such that water inside the vessel is unable to escape between the tube and bottom of the vessel. The tube 1 4 may be glued or otherwise affixed to the bottom of the vessel 10 and in fact may be moulded integralwith the vessel. A wick 15 of absorbent material extends from the inside of the container through the tube 14 through the spike 12 and out through a hole in the bottom of the spike 12. The inner end of the wick 15 is arranged at the bottom of the vessel 10 on the inside thereof and has a weight 16 of non corrosive material for the purpose of holding the wick down in the water.A knot 18 is tied in wick 15 towards the end which extends out through the spike 12. The knot prevents the wick from being pulled too far out of the spike and also reduces the possibility of the wick disappearing back into the spike from the outside since the size of the knot is made sufficiently larqe so as to not readily slide through the tube 14. It should be appreciated that water inside the vessel 10 is transported by the wick 15 upwardly to the top of the tube 14 and then downwardly through the tube 14 to the outside of the vessel 10 where it is absorbed into the soil 13 to continually moisten the soil. A series of holes 17 are arranged around the bottom end of the spike 12 to allow any water which builds up in the bottom end of the spike to be dissipated into the soil. In this manner the contents of the vessel are dissipated over a prolonged period of time and the soil is thereby maintained in a moist condition.The lenqth of time taken for the vessel to empty depends on the size of the vessel and the size and type of wick used and may be varied in accordance with different applications of the plant waterer. Whilst the embodiment described above uses a vessel in the form of a fiqurine it is conceivable that it could be moulded in the form of a piece of wood bark or a log or other ornamental device which would not look out of place when standing in a plant pot. According to a further embodiment the vessel 10 could be constructed with legs which would support the vessel above the soil 13 with the end of the wick being suspended a short distance above the surface of the soil in which case the water is caused to drip from the end of the wick and onto the soil. It should be evident that the present invention provides an improved plant waterer which is readily transportable from one plant to another and which is adapted to provide continuous moisture to a plant over an extended period of time. The device is most suitable for householders when aoing on holidays since it may be used to water an indoor plant for the duration of the holiday.Furthermore, the waterer according to the invention may be used on outdoor plants, that is, plants in the qround rather than in a pot in which case a larqer vessel may be utilized. Whilst the vessel shown is moulded from plastics material by any suitable form of moulding process clearlv it could be moulded or fabricated from any other suitable material.
