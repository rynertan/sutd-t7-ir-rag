# SELF CONTAINED ANTI THEFT DEVICE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
An anti theft device that is adapted to be connected adjacent to or on a battery of a motor vehicle and including a power switch for disconnecting the battery from its stan dard battery cable when current flowing through the cable exceeds a preselected substantial amount of current asso ciated with an attempt to start the vehicle. A lockout circuit is actuated by a remote transmitter for generating an exter nal command signal to override the operation of the power switch. This device can be attached directly to a battery without external wiring and still provide the passive or self arming anti theft device.
