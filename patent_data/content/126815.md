## Description
PUSHBUTTON SWITCH The present invention provides for a pushbutton type switch, specifically it means a newly structured, easy to use pushbutton type switch. Conventional and regular switches for HouseholdElectric Appliances such as lamps include rotation type, wall slab type, and the pushbutton type, all of them will serve to cut off currents swirftly, it has been found that the pushbutton type as cited above will turn failure ver frequently because it functions to link up or cut off a circuit by means of a pushbutton controlled mobile disk and a rotation wheel working together, which is quite complicated in structure, costly in production expenses in addition to high failure rates, The very objecti e of the present invention it is to provide, in view of the shortcomings of said oldfashioned pushbutton type switch, a newly structured, easy to use pushbutton switch. What follows is a detailed description of the pushbutton type switch as covered by the present inxen tion in one execution with reference to the attached drawings in which Fig. 1 is an orthographic view of the pushbutton switch as covered by the present invention Fig. 2 is a section view along segment 2 2 ofFig. 1 Fig. 3 is an illustration of the positional relationship between joint contacts and two polarity pieces as covered by a pushbutton switch according to the present invention and Fig. 4 is a view of the position setting groove as covered by a pushbutton switch according to the present invention. Referring to the drawings it is seen that the pushbutton switch 10 according to the present invention is structured to have a hollow cavity 14 formed down the central position of the switch slab 12, to have a four shiSt heartlikt position setting groove 16 provided to the left side of the inner wall of cavity 14, such that as the lover end of a pushbutton 18 is buried into such a cavity 14, the front end of a control shaft 24, oppressed by a compression spring 27r and installed in the caviTy 22 of the first wall surface 20 for the pushbutton 18, will get engaged in such a groove pass 16 and follow in an up and down movement in step with the command to pushbutton 38 alongside such a groove pass 16, thus achieving in commanding the position setting of the pushbutton 18. Referring now to Fig. 2 and it is seen that on the second wall surface 20b for the same pushbutton 18 there is provided a cambered wall dent 30 where polarity pieces 26, 28 and joint contacts 40 may be set for positioning, it is also seen that the first polarity piece 26 and the second polarity piece 28 are both attached to the right wall of the cavity 14, and are respectively joined to both polarities of the Power source by means of leaders Ll, L2, and that joint contact 4o is movably fitted to the arm 26A of the first polarity piece 26, that a cavity 32 is provided on a nose 30A on the underside of the cambered wall dent 30 to facilitate setting of a compression spring 34 and a steel ball 36 in the cavity 32, in order that the steel ball 36 will always get attached to the joint contact 4o under the thrust due to spring 34. Referring to Fig. 4 it is seen that the position setting groove 16 is profiled like a heart, the top end 16a, the bottom tip 16b, and both ends 16c, 16d on either side of the two halves that make up the heart will altogether form a cavity to the effect that the front end of the control shaft 24 may move away as carried by the tendency of the groove 16 when the pushbutton 18 is pressed to move about, such that as it moves to each cavity the front end of the control shaft 24 will get sunk into the cavity firstly, and become checked by the surface of such a cavity thus checked from floating away in the reverse direction, The pushbutton switch according to the present invention is in off condition when the pushbutton 18 is set to normal position, whereupon the front end of the control shaft 24 will get stuck to the cavity 16a at the narrow tip of the groove, when it comes to pass that the pushbutton 18 is depressed to move downwards, the front end of the control shaft 24 that is installed in the first wall surface 20a of the pushbutton 18 will move away in the direction indicated by arrow A along the left side of the groove pass 16 and wind up getting caught in a cavity 16c that is provided by the bottom of the left half of the groove 16, whereupon pushbutton IS will be relieved of forces imposed heretofore and lift up under the thrust due to spring 46 provided underneath to the effect that the front end of the control shaft 24 will once again float away upwardly in the direction following arrow B and wind up getting sunk into cavity 16b thereby setting the position of pushbutton 18, by this moment, steel ball 36 will react to exercise thrust against the lower end 40b of the joint contact 4o like what is hown in Fig. 2, and in the meantime to result in setting the lower end 40b of the joint contact 40 into contact with the second polarity piece 28 thereby achieving conduction of the circuit, now if pushbutton 18 is depressed once again to cause the front end of the control shaft 24 to move along the arrow direction C for the groove to reach the cavity 16d by the bottom to the right half of the heart, then pushbutton 18 will lift up once again under the thrust due to spring 46 underneath, thereby forcing the front end of the control shaft 24 to move away encircling path 44 and finally heading for and rur ning back to the cavity 16a on the top of the groove 16, as a result, the pushbutton will lift up to the previous position, and in the meantime the steel ball 36 provided on the underside of the pushbutton 18 will also float to the upper end 40a of joint contact 40 concurrent with the uplifting of the pushbutton 18 and further force the joint contact 40 to part from the contact point with the second polairty piece 28 in a manner illustrated by the dotted lines as given in Fig. 2, the circuit cut off accordingly. The structure of the pushbutton switch according to the present invention is simple enough but also easy to operate as well, to set the circuit to on condition, just depress pushbutton 18 in the manner given above, and when service by the circuit is no longer called for, just depress the pushbutton 18 once again and the pushbutton will return to non working condition instantly, having currents cut off forthwith, such an operation can be repeated all over again to serve an enduring operation that is always demanded of a switch.
