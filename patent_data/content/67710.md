# Television ghost cancellation system with phase controlled remodulation.

## Abstract
A television ghost signal cancellation system is provided which compensates for the phase of the ghost carrier signal. A video signal containing a ghost signal component is applied to a variable delay line 10 , which delays the video signal by an amount of time equal to the difference in time between the appearance of the direct video signal and its corresponding ghost signal components. The delayed video signal is modulated 12 by a carrier signal and demodulated 16 by a phase shifted 18 version of the carrier signal. The carrier signal is phase shifted for the demodulator 16 by an amount which compensates for the phase difference be tween the picture carriers of the direct and ghost signals. The demodulated signal is inverted and its amplitude adjusted 20 to produce a pseudo ghost signal which is substantially equal in amplitude but opposite in polarity to the ghost signal components. The pseudo.ghost signal is summed 50 with the original video signal to cancel the ghost signal components, thereby producing a deghosted video output signal. For further removal of residual ghost components in the output signal, the latter may be substituted as the input to the delay line for a recursive ghost cancellation operation.
