# A composite JFET bipolar structure.

## Abstract
A junction field effect transistor and a bipolar transistor are merged in a single composite device disposed within a single isolation region by the use of planar processing techniques. The device includes an annular source region 20 formed within a semiconductor body portion 12 constituting a collector zone. Within the central portion of the collector zone circumscribed by the annular source region there is formed an emitter zone 24 nested within a region 22 that constitutes both the drain region of the JFET and the base zone of the bipolar transistor. An annular channel region 28 connects the annular source region 20 and the central drain region 22 . An annular region 30 forming a semiconductor junction with the annular channel 28 adjacent to the annular source region 20 constitutes one of two gate regions of the JFET. The other gate region is constituted by the body portion 12 serving as the collector zone.
