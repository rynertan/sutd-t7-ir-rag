# Method for regenerating a denitration catalyst for exhaust gases from coal burning apparatus.

## Abstract
A method for regenerating a denitration catalyst for exhaust gases discharged from coal burning apparatus, in which a used catalyst whose denitration performance has lowered is contacted with fluidized abrasive particles 7 . As a result, catalyst poisons deposited on the catalyst surface are removed by abrasive contact.
