# Detecting the condition of a sheet or web.

## Abstract
For the detection of defects such as tears 14 or fold lines in banknotes 10 , for example, continuous wave ultrasonic energy is directed by a transmitter 15 to a flow path 11 for the notes 10 and ultrasonic energy reflected from the notes 10 or transmitted through tears 14 or holes in the notes 10 is converted by a receiver 16 into an electric signal. A signal analysing circuit is responsive to changes in the output of the receiver during the passage of the banknote. In the ultrasonic inspection area, the note 10 may be passed over rollers 12, 13 with flared ends to cause a tear 14 to open and allow the passage of ultrasonic energy. In a reflective system, the note 10 may be passed over a roller to cause one or both of the adjacent edges of a tear 14 to leave the roller surface. The electric signal is analysed for components indicative of a defect for tear detection, a spike filter 39 and a circuit 42, 31, 38, 34 for distinguishing tear signals from end of note signals may be used. For crinkle detection, the received signal may pass through a differentiator 32 , an integrator 34 and a threshold comparator 36 .
