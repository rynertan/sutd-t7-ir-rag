# SOUNDSTAGE BOUNDARY EXPANSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system for providing the effect of an extended sound stage comprises a pair of stereophonic loudspeakers 38A, 38B , each having a movable or vibrational element driven by a pair of voice coils 44A, 46A 44B,46B including a principal or main voice coil 44A, 44B and an auxiliary or enhancement voice coil 46A, 46B . The principal voice coil of each speaker is driven in a customary manner from one channel 70,72 74, 76 of a stereophonic amplifier, while the enhancement voice coil is driven in a reversed phase sense from the output of the opposite channel, and sound is effectively provided over an ex tended apparent source having dimensions beyond the spacing between the loudspeakers.
