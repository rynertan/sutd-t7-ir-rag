# Process for the production of oxygenated organic compounds.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the production of oxygenated organic compounds comprising alcohols, aldehydes, ethers and salts of carboxylic acids. Prior art processes for the production of ethanol in particular involve the use of elevated temperatures and pressures. Milder conditions can be used in the process of the invention in which either a mercury compound of formula R¹OCHR²CHR³Hg
