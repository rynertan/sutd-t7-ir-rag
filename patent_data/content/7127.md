# Process and apparatus for the manufacture of a relief printing form.

## Abstract
A process is provided for making a relief printing form which is at least partially cylindrical from a liquid photo polymerizable molding 19 material. In accordance with the process, a molding material 19 is spread over the internal surface of the cylindrical wall 2 by centrifugal force and hardened in the desired places with ultraviolet light 9 to form an image corresponding to a printing design. The nonhar dened portions of the molding material are then removed. The cylindrical wall 2 is a transparent cylindrical tube 2 . An exchangeable image bearing film 17 is placed on the inside of the tube. Photopolymerizing radiation of the printing form material is effected during rotation of the transparent cylindrical tube. An exchangeable image bearing film 17 is placed on the inside of the tube. Photopolymerizing radiation of the printing form material is effected during rotation of the transparent cylinder by means of one or more radiation sources 9 distri buted around the circumference of the transparent cylinder. The rays act on the molding material via the wall of the trans parent cylinder and the image bearing film. The radiation for hardening the printing form takes place in a continuous operation following the application of the molding material to the cylindrical wall by centrifugal force.
