# Heat storing apparatus.

## Abstract
A heat storing vessel 4 filled with a heat storing material of latent heat type 5 is providecl with a fluid flow passage 8 in thermal contact with the heat storing material for passing a fluid for storing and releasing heat. By passing a hot fluid through the fluid flow passage, the heat storing material in the heat storing vessel is melted to store heat. By passing a cold fluid through the fluid flow passage, the heat storing material in the heat storing vessel is solidified to release heat. The heat storing material contains a gelling agent to suppress a phase separation phenomenon. A low temperature part 4a is provided at a part of the heat storing vessel and the heat storing material containing the gelling agent is retained in a solid state at the low temperature part to prevent supercooling of the heat storing material.
