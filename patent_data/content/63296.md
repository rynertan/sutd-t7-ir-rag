# Three phase power distribution network communication system.

## Abstract
The invention provides a communication system for a three phase power distribution network comprised of a plurality of remote devices 37, 63 , with certain of the remote devices being used as signal repeaters 37 . Injection point circuitry 1 provides an out going communication signal which is coupled 15, 16, 17 to the three phase conductors 11, 12, 13 such that each phase conductor carries an identical, independent, outgoing communication signal. The signal repeaters are each coupled 43, 44, 45 to at least two of the three phase conductors. Each signal repeater includes circuitry 48 or 73 for producing a composite signal in response to the coupled signals. The composite signal has a signal to noise ratio typically superior to, but not worse than, the signal to noise ratio of the rest of the coupled signals. The remainder of the remote devices 63 are independently coupled 66, 69 to at least one of the three phase conductors so as to facilitate communication with each of the remote devices.
