# Carton and method of producing carton blanks therefor.

## Abstract
A gable topped, flat bottomed carton has a side seam 29 which, in a fin 11 17 of the gable top closure, fits in a gap between respective junctions of two pairs 12 and 13, 15 and 16 of internal sub panels of the fin. Two opposite external sub panels 11 and 14 of the fin have tabs 33 and 34 for pulling to open the closure to form a spout. The seam edge of one oblique sealing sub panel 8 of the closure has a tab 36 , with scorelines 37 from the tab 36 into that sub panel 8 , while the seam edge of the other oblique sealing sub panel 6 has a corresponding recess 38 covered by the one oblique sealing sub panel 8 , so that pulling of the tab 36 tears back the sub panel portion between the scorelines 37 to expose the recess 38 . The flat bottom closure has at the free edge of its widest sub panel a sealing projection 31 of a width of about one third of that of the sub panel to facilitate interdigita tion of the blanks.
