# Silicone organic coating compositions.

## Abstract
Homogeneous composition comprising certain liquid silicone resins, certain silicon free, film forming organic polymers and a compatibilizing liquid are disclosed. The homogeneous compositions are useful for coating a substrate to provide a water resistant coating on the substrate which can function, for example, as a protective coating or as an adhesive release coating and, accordingly, a method for coating a substrate, such as paper, is also disclosed.
