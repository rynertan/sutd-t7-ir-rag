# Method for inhibiting metal migration during heat cycling of multilayer metal thin film structures.

## Abstract
The formation of metal oxide contaminants on the sur faces of thin metal films by outdiffusion primarily through the grain boundaries of metal from an underlayer is in hibited by conducting heat cycling of such layered metal structures in an ambient gas mixture composed of inert gas, such as, nitrogen, containing a sufficient amount of active gas, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or the like, at a concentration of up to 5 , preferably 2,5 , substantially to suppress such outdiffusion.
