## Description
PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZATION OF a OLEFINBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the polymerization of a olefin and more particularly to a process for the production of highly stereospecific poly a olefins in a process having excellent polymerization activity, which comprises polymerizing an a olefin in the presence of a catalyst comprising a specific activated titanium catalyst component, an organometallic compound, and an electron donor compound. Various methods have heretofore been known as methods by which stereospecific poly a olefins can be produced in the presence of a catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component containing magnesium and titanium, and an organometallic compound. Examples of such methods are disclosed in JapanesePatent Publication No. 34098 1971, and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. 98076 1977 and 2580 1978. All of these methods, however, have various disadvantages.There has not yet been developed a method which satisfies various requirements that i polymers produced have high stereospecific property, high apparent density and high stability, ii the polymerization activity is very high, iii catalysts used can be easily handled, and iv polymers produced can be easily colored and the like. In particular, the polymerization activity of a catalyst and the stereospecific property of the polymer product are antipodal to each other, i.e., when the polymerization activity is increased, the stereospecific property is reduced, whereas when the stereospecific property is increased, the polymerization activity is reduced. It has, therefore, been believed that it is very difficult to maintain both the polymerization activity and stereospecific property at high levels.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The principal object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of poly a olefin having a high apparent density while maintaining both the polymerization activity and stereospecific property of the polymer formed at high levels. The present invention provides a process for producing poly a olefin having high stereo specific property which comprises polymerizing a olefin by the use of a catalyst comprising A a reaction product of a magnesium compound and a titanium compound, B an organometallic compound, and C an electron donor compound, wherein the reaction product used as Component A is a solid product which is prepared by reacting a magnesium dialkoxide represented by the general formula Mg OR1 2 wherein R1 contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and is an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, or an aralkyl group, with an electron donor compound, and then reacting the product obtained two or more times with a halogen containing tetravalent titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti OR2 nX14 n wherein R2 contains from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and is an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, an alkenyl group, or an aralkyl group, n is a real number between 0 and less than 4, and X1 is a halogen atom.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The magnesium dialkoxide as used herein has the general formula Mg OR1 2 wherein R1 contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and is an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, or an aralkyl group.

In particular, alkyl esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, for example, alkyl containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms esters of aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, p methoxybenzoic acid, p ethoxybenzoic acid, and toluic acid are preferred. In addition, aromatic ketones, such as benzoquinone, aromatic carboxylic anhydrides, such as benzoic anhydride, and ethers, such as ethylene glycol butyl ether, and the like are preferred. There are no special limitations to the conditions under which the magnesium dialkoxide is reacted with the electron donor compound, and they can be determined appropriately according to various circumstances. Usually, the electron donor compound is added to the magnesium dialkoxide in an amount of from 0.01 to 10 moles, preferably from 0.05 to 5 moles, per mole of the magnesium dialkoxide, and they are reacted at a temperature of 0 to 2000C for 5 minutes to 10 hours, and preferably at a temperature of 30 to 1500C for 30 minutes to 3 hours. To this reaction system, inert hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane and octane can be added as solvents. The thus prepared reaction product is reacted with the halogen containing tetravalent titanium compound. The halogencontaining tetravalent titanium compound has the general formula Ti OR2 nX14n wherein R2 contains from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and is an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, an alkenyl group, or an aralkyl group, X1 is a halogen atom, such as a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, and iodine atom, and n is usually an integer of 0, 1, 2 or 3, but may not always be an integer and is sufficient to be a real number within the range of 0 n 4 as an average value of a mixture of various titanium compounds.

In this reaction, if necessary, an inert solvent such as pentane, hexane and heptane can be used. In the process of the present invention, it is necessary to repeat the foregoing reaction using the halogen containing tetravalent titanium compound two or more times. When the reaction is performed just once, the property of the catalyst obtained is not improved to the extent that is satisfactory.In more detail, after the first reaction between the reaction product prepared by the reaction with the electron donor compound and the halogen containing tetravalent titanium compound is completed, the reaction solution is separated at a temperature of 0 to 2000C, preferably 30 to 1500C to obtain a reaction product, and the thus obtained reaction product is then, if necessary, after being washed with an inert solvent, such as heptane, reacted with the halogen containing tetravalent titanium compound under the same conditions as above.
