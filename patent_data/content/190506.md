# Conveyor with friction roll drive.

## Abstract
A plurality of rollers 10 are carried by a support 11 and have friction wheels 12 fixedly secured, the wheels 12 being frictionally engaged by further friction wheels 16 which are slidably and non rotatably carried on an input drive shaft 15 . Biasing springs 17 on the shaft 15 urge the wheels 16 into engagement with the wheels 12 and the bias of the springs 17 is adjustable by collars 18 on the shaft 15 to selectively vary the torque transmitted from the shaft 15 to the rollers 10 .
