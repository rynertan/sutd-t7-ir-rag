# MESFET TRANSISTOR WITH AIR LAYER BETWEEN THE CONNECTIONS OF THE GATE ELECTRODE AND THE SUBSTRATE AND THE RESPECTIVE FABRICATION PROCESS

## Abstract
In the new structure of the Schottky barrier field effect MESFET transistor, consisting of a substrate and three elec trodes source, gate and drain , the electrical resistance of the gate is practically zeroed by using an electrode having the shape of a continuous sheet which bypasses a portion of source and created an air layer between its connections. The fabrication process basically includes a first photo masking, evaporation of the metallization layer on photore sist material, growing, a second photomasking and etching of total metallization and removal of the two photoresists.
