# VEHICLE MULTIPLEX SYSTEM

## Abstract
A vehicle multiplex system comprises a control station 10 and a set of outstations 11 to 18 connected by individual buses 21 to 28 to the control station 10 . The control station 10 and outstations 11 to 18 receive signals from local sensors and control local loads. In order to achieve a short response time at a low data transmission rate, each individual bus 21 to 28 includes a pair of data lines. One data line transmits data from the control station 10 to the associated outstation and the other data line transmits data from the outstation to the control station 10 . The system is arranged so that the two data lines of each bus transmit data simul taneously. The control station 10 also includes a single bi directional port for transmitting data over a single bi direc tonal data line 31 to one or more extension stations.
