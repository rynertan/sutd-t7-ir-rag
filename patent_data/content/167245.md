## Description
ANTI ARRHYTHMIC AGENTS The invention relates to novel compounds useful as pharmaceuticals, particularly as anti arrhythmic agents, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Pharmacological agents possessing the ability to block cellular transmembrane influx of calcium are capable of suppressing that portion of myocardial or vascular smooth muscle contractility which is dependent upon extracellular calcium. Church et al., Can. J. Physiol.Pharmacol., 58, 254 1980 Fleckenstein, Calcium and theHeart, P. Harris and L. Opie, eds., Academic Press 1971 Nayler et al., Bas. Res. Cardiol., 76, 1 1981 CalciumBlockers, S. Flaim and R. Zelis, eds., Urban andSchwartzenberg, 1982 . These pharmacological agents, termed calcium entry blockers, have been proven to be useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and coronary artery vasospasm a possible cause of sudden cardiac death syndrome . Circ. Res., 52, Suppl. I, 1983 Hypertension 5, Suppl. II, 1983 . In theory, calcium entry blockers are thought to act by blocking calcium influx through discrete calcium channels slow channels in cell membranes. Various tissues exhibit relative differences in sensitivity toward the calcium blocking effect achieved by certain calcium antagonists, theoretically as a result of tissue specific differences in the calcium channels. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 43, 5 1978 loc. cit. 291 1978 Microvascular Res., 5, 73 1973 Am. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 17, 149 1977 .It is believed that the slow calcium current is responsible for activation of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node of the heart. Verapamil, a known calcium channel blocking agent, is believed to slow conduction velocity through the atrioventricular node of the heart, in explanation of the mechanism of its antiarrhythmic activity. In accordance with this invention there is provided a group of new compounds of the formula EMI2.1 in which Y is CH2 n where n is 1,2,3 or 4 or EMI2.2 preferably CH2 n where n is 2,3 or 4 EMI2.3 where R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms, polyfluorinated alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, CN, cyanoalkyl in which the alkyl moiety contains 1 to 3 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 3 to 6 carbon atoms or cycloalkylalkyl of 4 to 8 carbon atoms preferably alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl of 3 to 6 carbon atoms R2, R3, 4 R5, R6 and R7, independently, are hydrogen, alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, Cl, Br or F R8 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms preferably alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms R9 is alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms R 10 is alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms m is 0 or 1 preferably 0 p is 0, 1, 2 or 3 preferably 1, 2 or 3 and s is 0 or 1 preferably 0 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the provisos that the sum of m, p and s must be 1,2,3 or 4 and the number of linear atoms in the bridge connecting the two aromatic rings does not exceed 9 and when Y is methylene or dimethylene, two of R2, R3 and R4 are other than hydrogen. The preferred compounds of the invention from the standpoint of production economics and activity profile may be grouped as those in which 1 the aromatic ring to the left of the depicted structure contains three substituents in the 2 , 3 and 4 positions or the 3 , 4 and 5 positions where, preferably those substituents are lower alkoxy most preferably methoxy , Y is trimethylene, m and s are 0 and p is 2 2 the aromatic ring to the left of the depicted structure contains two substituents, either in the 3,5 or 3,4 positions, where preferably those substituents are lower alkoxy most preferably methoxy or halo most preferably Cl , Y is di, tri or tetra methylene, m and s are 0 and p is 2 and 3 the aromatic ring to the left of the depicted structure contains one substituent, in meta position, Y is trimethylene, m and s are 0 and p is 2. As subgeneric aspects of the invention there may be mentioned the compounds having formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts where either i the number of linear atoms in the bridge connecting the two aromatic rings does not exceed 8 or ii Y is tetramethylene whilst m and s are 0 and p is 2. As preferred subgeneric aspects of the invention there may be mentioned compounds having the formula Ia, Ib, Ic and IdEMI3.1 EMI4.1 in which Z representsEMI4.2 where R is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms Rê is hydrogen or alcoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms R3, R4, R6 and R7 are, independently, alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, Cl, Br or F n is 2,3 or 4 and p is 1 or 2 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.As aspects of these preferred compounds there may be mentioned the compounds of formulae Ia and Ib where n is 2 or 3 and of formula Id and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the antiarrhythmic agents of this invention are prepared directly by neutralization of the free base or by metathetical displacement. The physiologically acceptable salts may be formed with organic or inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, sulphonic, nitric, methylsulphonic, acetic, maleic, succinic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, salicylic, lactic, naphthalenesulphonic acid, and the like. The new compounds having formula I contain a secondary or tertiary amine function and an N substituted thioamide function. The compounds may therefore be prepared by various methods available for the preparation of secondary and tertiary amines alkylation of amines, reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and reduction of Schiff s bases, amides and thioamides or for the preparation of N substituted sulphonamides sulphonylation of amines and alkylation of sulphonamides . In the following description to explain the methods that may be used to prepare the compounds of the invention the following symbols will be used for brevity, namelyAr to represent the group having formula XIXEMI5.1 where R2 4 are defined supra R to represent any meaning of R other than hydrogen R12 represent hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 5 carbon atoms AÚ to represent hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms Aê to represent such a group that AÚAêCH is the same as the substituted lower alkylEMI5.2 where R5, R6, R7, R9, R10 m, p and s are as defined supra X to represent 0 or S Y to represent the same group as Y save that if a hydroxy group is present it may be protected by a removable protecting group and q to represent the integer n l where n is 2, 3 or 4, i.e. q is 1, 2 or 3. All other symbols such as Z, R 8, and R have the same meaning as in formula I. The invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound having formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises 1 sulphonylation of an aromatic amine Ar NHR to introduce the sulphonyl group having the formula II SO2 YÚ NR8 CHAÚAê II or 2 sulphonylation of an amine having the formula III H NR YÚ NR8 CHAÚAê III to introduce a sulphonyl group having the formula Ar SO2 at the nitrogen atom marked with an asterisk or 3 alkylation of a sulphonamide having the formula Ar SO2 NHR IV to introduce a substituted alkyl group having the formula V V1 NR8 CHA1A2 V or 4 alkylation of an amine having the formula VI Ar Z V1 N HR8 VI to introduce a substituted alkyl group having the formula CHA 1A2 at the nitrogen atom marked with an asterisk or 5 reductive amination of a carbonyl compound having the formula A1A2C o VII with an amine having the formula VI as illustrated above or 6 reduction of a Schiff s base having the formula VIII or IX Ar Z V1 N CA1A2 VIII Ar Z CH2 q C N CHAÚAê IX or of an amide or thioamide having formula X or XI Ar Z YÚ NR8 CX Aê IX Ar Z CH2 q CX NR8 CHAÚAê XI or 7 alkylation of an amine having the formula XII HNR8 CHA1A2 XII to introduce a substituted alkyl group having the formula XIII Ar z YÚ XIII or 8 reductive amination of an aldehyde having the formula XIV Ar Z CH2 g CHO XIV with an amine having the formula XII as illustrated above or 9 alkylation of a sulphonamide having the formula XV or XVI Ar SO2 NH Y1 NR8 CHA1A2 XV Ar NH SO2 Y1 NR CHA1A XVI to introduce an alkyl or substituted alkyl group R11 at the nitrogen atom marked with an asterisk or 10 reductive amination of an alkanone containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms with an amine having the formula XVII Ar Z Y1 NH CHA1A2 XVII or 11 reduction of an amide or thioamide having the formula XVIIIEMI7.1 and, where appropriate, removal of a removable protecting group. The process may also include removal of the acid from an acid addition salt to form the free base, metathetical displacement to convert one salt into another or neutralisation of the free base to form a salt. In order to prepare the compounds of the invention a sulphonylation reaction will normally be carried out at some stage of the synthesis. Where Y in the final product contains hydroxy, it may be recommended to protect the hydroxy group with a removable protecting group prior to sulphonylation to avoid sulphonylation at the hydroxy group. The hydroxy group is preferably protected by means of formation of its ester derivatives, for instance, acetate ester, which can be hydrolysed at any stage after the sulphonylation to restore the hydroxy group. The intermediate compounds used in steps 1 to 8 are known compounds or, where new, can be prepared by procedures within the skill of the medicinal chemist.The sulphonamides used in step 9 and the amines used in step 10 are novel compounds provided by this invention and can be prepared by steps 1 to 8 . The amides and thioamides used in step 11 can be prepared from the corresponding amines having formula XVI in known manner.The reaction conditions used in the aforesaid process may be those conventionally used for the preparation ofN substituted thioamides or secondary and tertiary amines.In the case of the alkylation reactions the alkylating agent is suitably a compound having the formula P Q whereP is the substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group to be introduced and Q is a leaving group or atom, preferably halogen, advantageously chlorine or bromine. The alkylation of amines is normally carried out by reacting the amine with the alkylating agent in the presence of a suitable base. The base may be an inorganic base, for instance, an alkali metal carbonate, a tertiary amine, for instance triethylamine, or an excess of the amine reactant. The amine reactant may be used in the form of the amine as such or in the form of a salt such as an alkali metal salt. The alkylation of sulphonamides is generally effected under basic conditions such that the sulphonamide is in salt form.In the case of the sulphonylation reactions the sulphonylating agent is suitably a sulphonyl halide derivative, preferably the sulphonyl chloride of the appropriate sulphonic acid. Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds may be effected with catalytic hydrogen, nascent hydrogen or the Leuckart reaction. Thioamides may be reduced to amines with borane or in a two step procedure comprising alkylation with an alkyl halide followed by reaction with sodium borohydride.Amides may be reduced to amines with lithium aluminium hydride. Schiff s bases may be reduced to amines by catalytic hydrogenation. The following examples of procedures may be given to illustrate the synthesis of the compounds of the invention. An aromatic amine ArNRH is sulphonylated by reaction with C1 S02 Y1 C1 and the sulphonylation product Ar NR SO2 Y s is used to alkylate an aralkylamine A12 A CHNR H. This reaction sequence affords theN arylalkanesulphonamide type of compounds of this series.The benzenesulphonamide type of compounds of this series may be produced by reaction of an appropriately substituted aromatic sulphonamide, for instance, Ar S02 NH CH CH3 2, with C1 Y NRCHA1A2 or by reaction of an aromatic sulphonyl halide with an omega hydroxyalkylamine, optionally followed by N alkylation, and replacement of the hydroxy group with a halogen and alkylation of the appropriate aralkylamine. The compounds of this invention exhibit Ca 2 antagonism in rabbit aortic smooth muscle when tested by a modified procedure from that described by Brockaert et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 53, 281 1979 . Here, transverse strips 10mm x 2.5mm from the thoracic aorta were cut and suspended vertically in a jacketed 38 C 50ml volume organ bath in physiological saline solution PSS aerated with 95 02 5 CO2. The composition of PSS was as follows mM NaCl 112, KCl 5, NaHC03 25, KH2P04 1, MgS04 1.2,CaCl2 2.5, dextrose 10. The lower end of each tissue strip was attached to a fixed post and the upper end to aStatham UC 4 transducer. Changes in force development were recorded on a Beckman Dynograph PolygraphicRecorder. Following equilibration, the muscles were contracted in a depolarizing solution of PSS in which 100 mM KCl was substituted for an equimolar concentration of NaCl.Following attainment of steady state isometric force 20 min. , the test compound was added to afford a final concentration of 1 x l05M. The inhibitory effect, expressed as percent relaxation, was determined from the mean of two experiments twenty minutes after the addition of the compound being tested. In addition, the compounds of this invention demonstrate an inhibitory influence on arterial Ca calmodulin dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation and subsequent contractile protein function when tested in standard experimental procedures for these inhibitory properties. As such, the compounds of the invention present an activity profile consistent with that of anti arrhythmic agents, which utility was proven in vivo experiments in the standard experimental animal as follows Rats weighing between 400 500 gms were anesthetized with 35 40 mg kg Na pentobarbital i.p. Rats were closeclipped on the neck and left side prior to cannulation of the jugular vein and tracheotomy. In some experiments, a catheter was introduced into the carotid artery for measurement of arterial blood pressure. Respiration was provided by a Harvard Model 681 respirator at a rate of approximately 55 min and a volume of 4 cc per cycle. The rat was then placed upon its right side and the heart was exposed by making an incision and separating the ribs. 4 0 silk on taper RB 1 needle was passed under the left anterior descending coronary artery LAD at a location just under the tip of the left atrial appendage. The suture was left to be tied upon occlusion. Lead II ECG and cardiotachometer output were recorded on a BeckmanR612. The rat was allowed to stabilize for several minutes before the administration of drug via the cannulated jugular vein. Compounds were suspended in carbowax, with total dose volumes kept below 0.20 0.25 ml.Fifteen minutes after dosing, the LAD was occluded by tying the suture. This procedure provokes severe ventricular arrhythmias, terminating in ventricular fibrillation and death in approximately 73 percent of animals given vehicle only. Data were analysed based on statistical analysis of heart rate fluctuations. Output from a Beckman cardiotachometer was digitised at 200 msec pt using a Nicolet 3091 digital oscilloscope, and the data analysed to yield mean f variance of the rate for each 1 minute period 300 points . The measured variance for the period 5 11 minutes post occlusion was well correlated with the severity of the observed ventricular arrhythmias, and provided a quantitive measure for the relative antiarrhythmic effectiveness of the compound being tested. For the purpose of these coronary ligation C.L. experiments, the actual mortality rate, expressed as a percentage of the animals employed, was obtained for purpose of comparison with the mortality rate of 73 percent in vehicle treated animals. Thus, these data establish the compounds of this invention as Ca antagonists which are useful as antiarrhythmic agents functioning more at the vascular level than other known Ca 2 entry blockers. It has been observed that compounds of this invention inhibit arterial Ca 2 calmodulin dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation and subsequent contractile protein function. Based upon the activity profile elicited by the compounds of this invention in the above described standard scientifically recognised test models, the compounds are established as anti arrhythmic agents useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and conditions characterised by coronary arteries vasospasm. For that purpose, the compounds may be administered orally or parenterally in suitable dosage forms compatible with the route of administration, whether oral, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal, buccal, etc. The effective dose range determined in the animal test models has been established at from 1 to about 50 milligrams per kilogram host body weight to be administered in single or plural doses as needed to relieve the arrhythmatic dysfunction.The specific dosage regimen for a given patient will depend upon age, pathological state, severity of dysfunction, size of the patient, etc. Oral administration is performed with either a liquid or solid dosage unit in any conventional form such as tablets, capsules, solutions, etc., which comprise a unit dose e.g. from about 25 milligrams to about 4 grams of the active ingredient alone or in combination with adjuvants needed for conventional coating, tableting, solubilising, flavouring or colouring.Parenteral administration with liquid unit dosage forms may be via sterile solutions or suspensions in aqueous or oleagenous medium. Isotonic aqueous vehicle for injection is preferred with or without stabilisers, preservatives and emulsifiers. Pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the invention in association or combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be prepared by bringing the compound of the invention into association or combination with the carrier. The following examples illustrate the preparation of a representative number of compounds of this invention.After each example, the Ca 2 antagonist activity of the compound is presented in terms of percent relaxation P.R. at 10 5M concentration unless indicated otherwise. Similarly, the percentage mortality of standard experimental test animals upon coronary ligation C.L. is presented for comparison with the control mortality rate of 73 percent of animals receiving vehicle alone.
