# Electrical switch with roller contact.

## Abstract
An electrical switch comprises a pair of spaced terminals 12, 13 , fixed in an insulating housing 10 a metal roller 16 and, a finger piece 14 for moving the roller 16 between first and second switching positions engaging only one 12 and both terminals 12 and 13 respectively. The one terminal 12 is resiliently flexed to bias the roller 16 against the second terminal 13 in the second switching position. The one terminal 12 comprises a cantilever spring 28 having an upset end 29 protruding into the roller path and providing the fulcrum for an overcentre action biassing the roller 16 in either switching position.
