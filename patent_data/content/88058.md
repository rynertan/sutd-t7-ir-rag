# A method and installation for filtration of liquid.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of arranging filters of the type comprising a large number of substantially annular, disc shaped thin filter elements 16 passed on a radially pervious and hollow core 14 , forming between themselves slots allowing passage of the liquid to be filtered, a pressure different being established between the space 8 outside the filter element pile and the space within the core to permit the liquid transport through the slots. The novety resides in the steps of enclosing in a closed vessel the core with the filter elements passed thereon, connecting the interior of the core with an outlet line or the like establishing initial application between the filter elements by spring means 18 which are adapted to act upon an end support 17 engaging one end of the filter element pile and being displaceable along the core, and adjusting the relative application of the filter elements and thus the slots to the desired filtering degree by adjustment of the differential pressure, i.e. the difference between the higher pressure in the closed vessel and the pressure in the interior of the core, in such a way that the filter element pile will be axially compressed.
