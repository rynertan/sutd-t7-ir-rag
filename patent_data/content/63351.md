# Defrost control system and display panel.

## Abstract
A defrost control system is provided for initiating one or more defrost timing cycles each at a preselected different time and for terminating the cycles at the end of their respective predetermined defrost period. The unit generally includes a solidstate, microprocessor based, programmable twenty four hour timer, and a display panel having an electrooptical digital time display and two sets of defrost status program indicators. The two sets of defrost indicators are separately or concurrently activated to visually present a display indicative of a plurality of program and operating status events, for example, the occurence of an automatic or manual defrost initiation.
