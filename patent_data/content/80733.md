# DUAL FUNCTION CARGO DISCHARGE APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a self unloading vessel having hoppers with discharge outlets for discharging either lump or pulverulent material onto an unloading conveyor, discharge apparatus includes a wheeled carriage supporting two separate gate assemblies thereon and movable to bring one or the other of the gate assemblies into discharge relationship with the hopper outlet. One gate assembly includes a horizontally sliding gate which is driven between open and closed positions by a drive cylinder. The other gate assembly includes fluidized bed airslide apparatus for directing pulverulent material to a discharge passage closed by a butterfly valve. Two embodi ments are disclosed. In one a separate drive cylinder is provided for moving the carriage between its two positions along associated rails. In the other the one gate can be releasably pinned to the other gate assembly. The relative positions of the two gate assemblies are reversed in the two embodiments.
