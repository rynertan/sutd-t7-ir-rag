# Improved fluidized supporting apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluidized patient support structure 10 in which a mass of granular material is received within an open ended container between a fluid diffuser plate and a flexible sheet 30 on which the patient may lie in a supine position. Pressurized fluid passes through the diffuser plate and suspends the granular material in a fluidized form. The diffuser plate has a predetermined variable contour and a predetermined depth of fluidized material thereabove ade quate to support a patient in a supine position.
