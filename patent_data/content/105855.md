## Description
An Electric Drive System The present invention relates to an electric drive system which comprises a slip ring induction motor, the stator winding of which is supplied from a direct current source through a machine commutated static converter. The drive system according to the invention has primarily been developed for operating electric traction vehicles, but can also be used in other connections, for example in the operation of various industrial machines.The development of hydrostatic transmission systems and the wide advances made in such systems has meant that electrohydraulic drive systems for vehicle operation are becoming of more and more interest. With present day hydrostatic transmission systems, it is possible to attain both highly advanced control functions and requisite hydraulic monitoring functions, and hence very modest demands are placed on the electric drive of the hydraulic pumps incorporated in the system. An important characteristic of these electrohydraulic drive systems is that the electric drive motors need not be started electrically, but can be started mechanically by means of a hydraulic motor supplied from a hydraulic accumulator. Similar views exist in respect of such vehicle drive systems as those which include a fly wheel, for leveling variations in the power requirements of the vehicle at varying loads and at acceleration and retardation, these vehicle drive systems also becoming of greater interest. Consequently, in this context the most desirable properties of the electric drive system is reliability in operation, simplicity and cheapness. The most obvious alternative is a direct current motor which is supplied either direct from a source of direct current, for example in vehicle operation with d.c. contact line, or via a transformer and an uncontrolled rectifier bridge, for example in vehicle operation with an a.c. contact line.Although such an electric drive system fulfills all recuirements with respect to simplicity and cheapness, it is not, however, satisfactory with regard to reliability, due to the problems associated with the commutator of the c rect current motor. With respect to operational reliability, a brushless drive system having a short circuited induction motor would be ideal. The demands of simplicity and cheapness, however, would be harder to satisfy in this case. Consequently, the object of the present invention is to provide an electric drive system which is inexpensive, simple and reliable, and which can be used to advantage for various operational functions. The drive system according to the invention includes a slip ring induction motor having a direct current excited rotor and a stator which is supplied through a machinecommutated static converter in a known manner from a directcurrent source, which may consist of a direct current mains, for example in vehicle operation with a d.c. contact line, or of an uncontrolled rectifier bridge connected to an alternating current mains, for example in vehicle operation with an a.c. contact line. According to the invention, the direct current supply to the static converter, when the motor is under load, is also used for the rotor excitation in that the rotor winding is connected to the direct current source in series with the static converter. The required no load excitation of the rotor is achieved by means of separate excitation means. In this way, it is possible to start the motor mechanically up to full voltage, before it is connected to the supplying direct current source, which facilitates this connection. In accordance with the invention the necessary no load excitation can be achieved by two different methods. According to one method, a condenser bank is connected to the stator winding of the motor, whereupon the condenser bank provides the no load excitation. According to the other method, the no load excitator is achieved through a rectifier connected to an alternating current source, the direct current outlets of the rectifier being connected across the rotor winding. The drive system according to the invention fulfills requirements on simplicity and cheapness, and also on opera tional reliability, since operational experiences with sli rings in long term operations have been excellent. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a simplified circuit diagram of a first embodiment of the invention, in which no load excitation is achieved by means of a condenser bank and Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of a second embodiment of the invention, in which the no load excitation is achieved by means of a rectifier bridge connected to an alternatingcurrent source. Fig. 1 illustrates by way of example a simplified circuit diagram of a first embodiment of a drive system according to the invention, intended for electric vehicle operation with an a.c. contact line. The electric drive system according to the invention includes a slip ring induction motor, generally shown at 1, comprising a stator having a stator winding 2, and a rotor having a rotor winding 3. The stator winding 2 is supplied with current from a machine commutated static converter 4, provided with a control unit 5 and connected to the direct current terminals of a diode rectifier bridge 6, through a smoothing inductor 7. The alternating current terminals of the rectifier bridge 6 are connected, via a contactor 8, to the secondary winding of a main transformer 9, the primary winding of which is connected to the current collector 10 of the vehicle. The rotor of the induction motor 1 is direct current excited and when the motor operates under load the rotor winding 3 obtains its excitation current mainly from the current I suppled to the static converter bridge 4, due to the fact that the rotor winding 3 is connected, via its slip rings 11, to the direct current terminals of the rectifier bridge 6, in series with the static converter 4. h diode 12 is connected in parallel across the rotor winding 3, to suppress reverse voltages occurring thereacross. When there is no load on the induction motor 1 and the motor is started up mechanically, the necessary no load excitation of the roTor is effected by the fact that a condenser bank 13 is connected to the stator winding 2, this condenser bank providing the necessary no load excitation. The only difference between the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1 and the embodiment of a drive system according to the invention illustrated in Fig. 2 resides in the arrangements for the no load excitation of the rotor winding 3. Like components in Figs. 1 and 2 are identified by the same reference numbers. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2, no load excitation of the rotor winding 3 is obtained by connection of the winding, via its slip rings 11, to the direct current terminals of a diode rectifier bridge 14, which is connected in series with the static converter 4 to the direct current terminals of the rectifier bridge 6. The alternating current terminals of the rectifier bridge 14 are connected to the secondary winding of an auxiliary transformer 15, the primary winding of which is connected to a suitable alter lating current source. It will be seen that a drive system according to the invention is extremely simple and inexpensive, and should also be highly reliable in operation, since excellent experiencies have been had with the long term operation of slip ring motors. It will also be seen that if the drive system according to the invention is to be supplied from a directcurrent mains, for example in vehicle operation with a d.c.contact line, the diode rectifier bridge 6 and the main transformer 9 are not required. If a drive system according to the invention designed in accordance with Fig. 2 is connected to an alternatingcurrent mains having sufficiently high frequency, for example 50 Hz, the motor can also be started electrically, via the static converter 4 in a manner known per se, whereupon the requisite no load excitation of the rotor is obtained, also in this case, via the rectifier bridge 14 from the auxiliary transformer 15.
