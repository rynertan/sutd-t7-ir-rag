A reaction sequence set out as chemical equations for the preparation of the compounds of the invention is given in Chart 1. Alternate procedures for the preparation of certain compounds of Formulae Iw, Ix, Iy and Iz are set out as chemical equations in Charts 2, 3 and 4. Methanones, Formula II, See Chart 1. The methanone intermediates are prepared by heating a mixture of the halo amino pyridine and an aminobenzophenone for a shorter period of time than that required for cyclization to the pyridobenzodiazepine as indicated by chemical ionization mass spec. analysis. For the 2 fIg amino 2 pyridinyl amino phenylmethanones, the conditions required are about 1 to 1.5 hr at 170 2000C.The methanones may be isolated as the predominant product, if desired, by cooling and adding z suitable organic solvent such as, for example, methylene chloride which will dissolve unreacted starting materials and some cyclized compound Ia followed by usual methods of isolating such as partitioning between the solvent and aqueous base or methanolic aqueous base followed by washing, drying, evaporating the solvent layer and recrystallizing from a suitable solvent. Unsubstituted. Pyridobenzodiazepines. Formulas Ia and Ia l R E . See Chart 1. The purified compounds of FormulaII or crude compounds of formula II may be further heated in an aprotic solvent to cyclize to compounds of Formula Ia, removing water from the reaction mixture by conventional means for example, under reflux using a Dean Stark water trap.However, it is not necessary to stop heating at the intermediate stage generally, it is sufficient to continue heating of the original reaction mixture i.e. a mixture of compound of fonrmlas III IV, for a longer period of time during which cyclization to compounds of formula Ia occurs. In the cyclization stagem whichever route is used, the temperaqture time relationship will vary to some extent depending on the reactants used, it being only necessary to heat for a tixte sufficient to pro duce the product desired as indicated by chemical ionization spec.The unsubstituted pyridobenzodiazepines may be purifi by partitioning between a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride and aqueous base, washing and drying the solvent layer, evaporating and chromatographing in a suitable solvent system such as acetone benzene.

The compounds suspended in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl formamide are added to a stirred suspension of sodium hydride in the same solvent. The halo alk1 Q reagent alkylaminating agent or agent leading to alkyl amination is added at about room temperature and the reaction mixture is stirred for a period of time until reaction is complete as, for example, determined by thin layer chromatography. The unreacted sodium hydride is decomposed by adding to water and the product is extracted with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride followed by aqueous acid extraction of the solvent layer and isolating the product from the aqueous layer by neutralization and re extraction with methylene chloride followed by evaporation and precipitating, preferably as an addition salt such as a fumarate, hydrochloride, oxalate, or maleate.Generally, once having obtained and purified an acid addition salt, the free base may be regenerated by partitioning the salt between an aqueous base and a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride and evaporating the methylene chloride layer. The corresponding dihydrodiazepines may be prepared by reduction with sodium borocyanohydrin. Alternately, compounds of Formulas Ib wherein Q is a halogen atom may be converted to compounds wherein Q is N loweralRyl 2 by reacting with an appropriate dialkylamine as given in the reaction sequence of Chart 2.

Syn. coll. Vol. III, pp 151 153. Generally, about 2 3 hr reflux time is sufficient after which aqueous acid is added and the mixture is filtered. The primary alk1 amines may be isolated from suitable solvents such as isopropyl alcohol. Rydrochiorides and hydrochloride hydrates are preferred salts in the isolation step. The corresponding dihydrodiazepines may be obtained by reauction with sodium borocyanohydrin. The alk1 monoalkylamines Formula Ie e.g., where R1 methyl,. R2 hycrogen, may be prepared as shown in Chart 1 by reacting the primary alk1 NH2 derivatives Formula Ic or Ic l with refluxing triethyl orthoformate for a period of time sufficient to form the methanimidic acid ester formula I d which is then reacted with sodium borohydride. The unreacted borohydride is decomposed with water and the product extracted out with a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate and may be purified by column chromatography and partitioning with basic solvent. Hydrochlorides are preferred salts in the isolation step. The method is more fully exemplified inExamples 3 and 44.The corresponding dihydrobenzodiazepines may then be prepared by reduction with sodium borocyanohydrin. Alkl monomethylamines may also be prepared by reaction of the primary amine with ethyl chloroformate as in Example 45, and thereafter reducing with lithium aluminium hydride as exemplified in Chart 3. A further more generalized alternative for introduction of alk1 monoloweralkyl amine radicals is via the radical EMI14.1 See Chart 1.

Exemplary of solid carriers for oral administration are such as lactose, magnesium, stearate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, stearic acid, gelatin, agar, pectin or acacia. Exemplary of liquid carriers for oral administration are vegetable oils and water. For intramuscular a3ministration t he carrier or excipient may be a sterile, parenterally acceptable liquid e.g., water or a parenterally acceptable oil e.g., arachis oil contained in ampoules. Although ve,ry small quantities of the active materials of the present invention are effective when minor therapy is involved or in cases of administration to subjects having a relatively low body weight, unit dosages are usually from five milligrams or above and preferably 10, 25, 50, or 100 milligrams or even higher, preferably administered three or four times per day, depending, of course, upon the emergency of the situation, the compound used, and the particular result desired. Twenty five to 200 milligrams appears optimum per unit dose or usual broader ranges appear to be about 10 to 500 milligrams per unit dose. Daily dosages usually required should range from about 0.3 to about 20 mg kg day, preferably 0.3 to 10 mgvkg for the more active compounds.The active ingredients of the invention may. be combined with other compatible pha acologica,lly active agents. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be obtained consistent with the dosage form employed. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. The exact individual dosages as well as daily dosages will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician. The following formulations are representative for the pharmacologically active compounds of this invention.
