## Description
SULFOCHLORINATED OLEFIN POLYMERS. MONOMERS MADE THEREFROM AND PROCESS THEREFORField of the Invention This invention relates to olefin polymers which have been sulfochlorinated to a relatively low level of chlorosulfonyl groups. to ionomers prepared from such polymers and to a process for preparing such ionomers. More particularly, this invention relates to such sulfochlorinated products as have been prepared in a low pressure gas phase process from porous olefin polymers.Background of the Invention Chiorosulfonated ethylene polymers have been produced by chiorosulfonating the ethylene polymer with C12 and 502 or S02C12. For commercial purposes, these chlorosulfonated polymers have had. to date, a relatively high level of C12 and SO in the form of C1 and SO2C1 groups.i.e.. usually more than about 25 weight C1 and more than about 0.5 weight S S. Moreover. they also have a relatively high Cl S ratio, i.e., of more than about 15. These chlorosulfonated polymers are also usually prepared in solution polymerization processes which require the handling and disposition of relatively large volumes of solvent. See in this regard. U.S. Patent 4,145,491. Sulfonate ionomeric polymers have been prepared from elastomeric olefin polymer feedstocks by the sulfonation of unsaturated sites in these resins with a sulfonating agent such as sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization. See in this regard U.S. Patents 3,870.841 and 4,105,647. However, these polymeric feedstocks are essentially non crystalline amorphous materials. The ionomers prepared therefrom therefore would also be essentially non crystalline. U S. Patent 3,624, 054 discloses the preparation of sulfochlorinated polyethylene which contains low amounts of chlorine and sulfur. These polymers. however, have very low sulfur contents and there is no indication in the patent that ionomers could be prepared from such polymers. Prior to the present invention. it has not been thought possible to prepare useful ionomers in a gas phase process from olefin polymers which have been modified with relatively low levels of chlorine and sulfur, and particularly those having a relatively high ratio of S C1. The term sulfochlorination , as used herein. means modifying olefin polymers with relative low levels of chlorine and sulfur at a relatively high ratio of S C1. An ionomer is a polymer with pendant ionic groups. These groups aggregate into multiplets which act as ionic crosslinks.Objects of the Present Invention An object of the present invention is to provide novel sulfochlorinated olefin polymers and ionomers prepared therefrom. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for the production of sulfochlorinated olefin polymers. A further object of the present invention is to produce a sulfonate ionomeric polymer. i.e., an ionomer, from a partially crystalline polyolefin resin and in which some level of crystallinity is retained in the monomer. A still further object of the present invention is to produce ionomers which have an inherent reversible cross linking system which imparts to the ionomers better tensile strength and solvent resistance properties than are present in the feedstock hydrocarbon polyolefins.Summary of the Invention It has now been found that the objects of the present invention can be readily obtained, in a two step process. if particulate porous olefin polymers are, first sulfochlorinated in a gas phase process to produce certain sulfochlorinated resins.as described below, and such sulfochlorinated resins are then treated with an ionomer forming reactant.DescriPtion of the Preferred Embodiment Olefin Polymer The olefin polymers which are to be used as the starting materials in the two step process described herein are homopolymers or interpolymers produced in a low pressure fluid bed process from one or more C2 to C8 alpha monoolefins. The polymers should be in the form of a particulate granular material having an average particle size of about 150 to 2000 microns. They should also have a modulus value of about 1000 to 175.000 psi and a crystallinity of about 5 to 80 . The homopolymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene l and poly 4 methylpentene l. The interpolymers are random or block copolymers formed from two or more of the olefin monomers. The interpolymers include ethylenepropylene copolymer. ethylene butene l copolymer.ethylene hexene l copolymer. ethylene propylenehexene terpolymer, ethylene butene hexene terpolymer, propylene butene l copolymer and propylene 4 methyl pentene 1 copolymer. The preferred interpolymers which are to be used in the process of the present invention include particulate, porous, crystalline ethylene polymers formed from about 50 to 99, and preferably about 75 to 96. mol of ethylene and from about 1 to 50, and preferably about 4 to 25. mol of one or more C3 to C8 alphamonoolefins such as propylene. butene l, pentene l. 4 methyl pentene l. hexene l. heptene l and octene l. They would have a density of about 0.87 to 0.95 and preferably of about 0.90 to 0.93. The amount and the chain length of theC3 to C8 comonomers used has a direct bearing on the density of the resulting ethylene interpolymer.The longer the chain length of the C3 to C8 comonomer is. the less of such comonomer is needed to achieve a given density from 0.96 for the homopolymer down to 0.87. Therefore, the extreme ratios of the comonomers to be used, in order to obtain a desired density in the range of from 0.93 down to 0.87 would be. a mole ratio of 0.04 1 to 0.35 1 for the ratio of propylene to ethylene.wherein propylene is the C3 to C8 comonomer with the shortest chain length, and a mole ratio of 0.01 1 to 0.25 1 for the ratio of octene l to ethylene. wherein octene l is the C3 to C8 comonomer with the longest chain length. The mole ratios of the other C3 to C8 comonomers to be used for this purpose would lie, proportionately, between these ratios for propylene and octene l. These olefin homo and inter. polymers have an average particle size of about 150 to 2000, and preferably of about 300 to 1300, microns. a bulk density of about 10 to 30, and preferably of about 12 to 24. a porosity or pore volume of about 0.1 to 0.5, and preferably of about 0.2 to 0.4. cc gram. and a s crystallinity of about 5 to 90. These particulate. porous, crystalline olefin homo and inter polymers can be prepared in a low pressure less than or equal to about 1000 psi gas phase process. They can be so prepared with various Ziegler or Ziegler Natta type transition metal based catalyst systems. Low pressure gas phase processes for employing such catalysts to produce such polymers are known in the art. The preparation of the preferred ethylene inter polymers with a process and catalyst of this type is disclosed. for example. in U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 480,296 filed March 28. 1983 in the names of F.J. Karol et al. Other gas phase processes wherein. it is believed. crystalline ethylene interpolymers in the density range of about 0.87 0.93 can be prepared with catalysts of this type are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4.338,424 4.363,904 4,370,456 and 4,372,919 and U.K. Patent Applications 2,006,232, 2,033,910, 2,034,336 2,034,723 2,036,764 and 2.066.274. Ethylene homopolymers or terpolmers may also be prepared with such catalysts as disclosed for example in U.S. Patents 4,303,771 and 4,383,095 Re homopolymers and U.S. Patents 4,359,561 and 4,363,904 Re terpolymers . The ethylene polymers may also be prepared by a low pressure fluid bed process with various Cr compound based catalysts such as chromium trioxide.triphenylsilyl chromate and bis cyclopentadienyl chromium as disclosed for example in U.S. Patents 3,709,853, 4,003,712, 4,011,382 and 4,115,639. The reactor systems disclosed in such patents may also be used for making the other olefin polymers used in the first step of the process of the present invention.Two SteP Process The process of the present invention is a two step process. In the first step the granular olefin polymer is treated with C12 and S02 gases in the gas phase. and in the second step the sulfochlorinated polymer is treated with ionomer forming reactants.First SteP of the Process The first step in the process of the present invention is conducted in the gas phase in the absence of solvents or liquid diluents. The preferred of such gas phase processes are the fluidized or agitated bed type processes which can be operated for extended periods of time. The first step in the process is conducted treating or reacting the granular crystalline olefin polymer with a sulfochlorinating modifying agent. preferably a mixture of S02 and Cl2, in the gaseous state under the operating conditions employed until th desired amounts of C1 and S are added to the olefin polymer. The addition of the modifying agents also causes a lowering of the crystallinity and tensile modulus of the starting polymer it js believed, by randomly replacing hydrogen atoms on the polymeric backbone with more buiky groups such as SO2Cl and C1 during the sulfochlorination modification of the crystalline polymer. This disrupts the crystalline order in the olefin polymer. The time required for this to occur will vary from about 2 to 24 hours depending on the particular crystalline polymer used as the starting material, and temperature and pressure employed in the reaction system, as well as on the particle size, porosity and crystallinity of the olefin polymer. Thus, the lower the crystallinity. and the greater the porosity and the smaller the particle size of the olefin polymer. the faster will the modifeication process proceed. The temperature to be used is in the range of about 50 to about 100C below the melting point of the olefin polymer. and the pressure to be used is in the range of from atmospheric pressure up to about 1000 psi. The pressure should also be one at which none of the reactants or by products will condense under the overall reaction condition scheme. The higher the pressure and temperature, the shorter will be the reaction time, if all the other conditions are the same.The sulfochlorination modifying agents that may be used would include either 502 plus Cl2 orS02C12 S 2 As a result of the sulfochlorination treatment. the backbone of the sulfochlorinated polymers will contain randomly distributed carbon SO2Cl bonds and small amounts of carbon chlorine bonds. In these sulfochlorinated polymers a the total chlorine concentration vill range from about 1.7 to 15 weight . and preferably from about 4 to 6 weight . and the sulfur content will range f rom about 1.5 to 7 weight , and preferably from about 2 to 4 weight X, based on the total weight of the sulfochlorinated polymer.The mol ratio of sulfur to chlorine a as elements. in these polymers will range from about 0.1 to 1.0 and preferably from about 0.25 to 0.9. The amounts of the C12 and S02 gases to be used in the reactor during the first step of the process relative to the amount of the particulate polymer to be treated therewith is at least 5 weight t. Where SO2 plus C12 are used as the modifying agent. the ratio of SO2 Cl2 used is about 7 to 100 and preferably about 30 to 70, on a volume basis. When SO2Cl2 and SO2 gases are the combination of modifying agents employed in the first step of the process of the present invention. the amounts of such gases to be used, relative to the amounts of the particulate polymer to be treated therewith is at least B weight .The ratio of S02 602C12 used is about 6 to 190. and preferably about 2 to 70, on a molar basis. About 10 to 50 volume of an inert gas such as nitrogen may be used in conjunction with the gaseous modifying agent when the reaction is conducted in the gas phase. It has been found that because of the physical properties of the oleo in polymers selected for use in the process of the present invention.particularly those used in porous particulate form, it is, much easier to remove any residual unreacted materials such as modifying agent. or HC1 by product. from, the polymer by merely flushing them out with an inert gas such as nitrogen. Since there are no components of the reaction system, other than polymer, modifying agent s ,HCl by product, and, optionally. inert gas, used in the first step of the process of the present invention. when the process is conducted in t he gas phase. such as solvents. diluents, swelling agents, fluidizing agents. or catalysts. there is no need to expend any efforts to remove any materials of these latter types from the sulfochlorinated product. Thus, the sulfoehlorinated product may also be used directly.without the need for any post reactor treatment, in the second step of the process of the present invention. when it is made in the gas phase in the first process step. The sulfochlorinated polymers produced by the first step in the process of the present invention would have the following physical properties a tensile strength of about 200 to 3000, and preferably of about 500 to 2000, psi, a tensile modulus, at 230C, of about 1000 to 50,000, and preferably of about 2000 to 30,000 psi, and an elongation at break of about 50 to 1500, and preferably of about 50 to 1000, t. Second SteP of the Process In the second step of the process of the present invention the sulfochlorinated polymers produced in the first step. as described above, are treated. or reacted. with a neutralizing agent which is basic in nature and which neutralizes the SO2Cl groups on the polymeric backbone of the sulfochlorinated polymer. Neutralization , as used herein. refers to hydrolysis of the sulfonyl chloride groups and neutralization of the resulting sulfonic acid. The neutralizing agent is used in such amounts as to neutralize at least 30. and preferably at least 90,S of the 502C1 groups present in the polymer. This reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 25 to 170, and preferably of about 70 to 160, C. This usually takes about 3 to 100 minutes.The reaction is conducted under a pressure of about 15 to 100 psia in a slurry. or solution, or fluxed melt of the polymer. Where a solvent is used it may be a hydrocarbon, chlorinated or polar solvent. About 1 to 5 mols of the neutralizing agent are used per mol of SO2Cl group of the polymer being treated. The neutralization agents which can be employed are well known in the art and include the hydroxides. alkoxides. carbonates and bicarbonates of ammonia, lithium, sodium. potassium, rubidium, cesium, magnesium, calcium and zinc. Calcium is the preferred cation. Small amounts of water may also be added to the reaction system to assist in the neutralization reaction. To assist in the neutralization process of the second step of the process of the present invention this step of the process may also be conducted in the presence of an ionalyzer and a stabilizer if the reaction is conducted in a melt flux. or in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst emulsifier if the process is conducted as a two phase solution system, as is known in the art. These ionalyzers and stabilizers are well known in the at of ionomer forming neutralization reactions. These ionalyzers would include zinc stearate, and calcium stearate. and they are employed to improve the melt processability of the ionomers. The ionalyzers are used in amounts of rout 5 to 10 weight based on the amount of resin present in the reaction system. The stabilizers would include epoxidized soybean oil. stearates andHC1 scavengers. The stabilizers are used in amounts of ,about 0.5 to 1.0 weight based on the amount of resin present in the reaction system. The resulting ionomers produced in the second step of the process of the present invention would have the following physical properties a tensile strength of about 500 to 5000.and preferably of about 900 to 4000, psi. a tensile modulus. at 230C. of about 1000 to 50.000, and preferably of about 2000 to 30.000. psi. an elongation at break of about 10 to 1500, and preferably of about 30 to 700, , a T2 of at least 5 to 1500C and preferably at least 25 to 500C greater than that of the sulfochlorinated feedstock resin and the starting ethylene polymer. and a retained degree of crystallinity of about 2 to 60, and preferably of about 8 to 30,. The properties of the polymers discussed herein were determined by the following test methods Density ASTM 1505 A plaque is made and conditioned for one hour at 1000C to approach equilibrium crystallinity.

The following Examples are provided to illustrate the process and products of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof. Anaratus Process For Gas Phase First Step Process Ethylene polymers were sulfochlorinated in the first step, in the gas phase. in a three liter three necked glass flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, gas dispersion tube and thermometer. The apparatus was charged with the desired amount of ethylene polymer and immersed in an oil bath held at the desired temperature 60 1050C . The sulfur dioxide and chlorine gases were metered via a flowmeter, premixed and admitted to the vessel through the gas dispersion tube. The unreacted gases and gaseous byproduct HC1 were swept through a modified thermometer well and into an aqueous sodium hydroxide trap. The reaction was stirred and allowed to proceed until the desired mass gain of the apparatus indicated that a certain sulfur level had been reached 4 30 hours . Previous experiments had defined the percentage of mass gained that was attributable to sulfur. The flask and contents were cooled and purged with dry nitrogen. A sample of product was submitted for various tests if desired and the remainder was used for ionomer formation in the second step. A Paratus Process for Second Steu SulfochlorinationProcess Two alternative procedures were used for the second step.Procedure A In Solution Fifty 50 grams of the sulfochlorinated resin prepared in the first step was charged into a one liter three necked resin kettle containing 700 ml of chlorobenzene CB or dichlorobenzene DCB and about 9 grams of the neutralizing agent a which was sodium hydroxide NaOH , zinc acetate Zn OAc 2 or calcium acetate Ca OAc 2 , and 40 ml of distilled water. The kettle was fitted with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer and air condenser.The apparatus was immersed in an oil bath and heated to 90 to 1000C for 1 to 4 hours with continuous stirring. The resulting product mix was then cooled and poured into one liter of acetone in a Waring blender and mixed for 2 minutes. The product was washed twice with acetone in this manner and filtered. After being dried under vacuum at 700C overnight, the resulting resin product was melt fluxed with an ionalyzer if necessary to facilitate melt processability and analyzed.Procedure B In Melted Flux Forty 40 grams of the sulfochlorinated resin prepared in the first step, about 2 grams of neutralizing agent, 1.25 grams of zinc stearate and 0.2 grams of epoxidized soybean oil were thoroughly mixed and charged to a Brabender melt mixer heated at 1600C. The mixture was fluxed for 2 minutes and then removed. Infrared analysis of the products showed that the SO2Cl groups has been transformed to SO groups, indicative of ionic structure.Examples 1 4 In these examples 150 grams of low pressure ethylene propylene or ethylene butene l copolymers were sulfochlorinated in the gas phase with SO2 and C12 at atmospheric pressure in the first process step of the present invention in the apparatus described above under the following conditions, to produce sulfochlorinated products having the following properties Examples 1 2 3 1Reaction ConditionsTime, hours 20 13 15 18Temperature, C 105 60 60 60 502 C12 feed 15 15 15 30 by volume Examples 1 2 3 4Starting CopolymerPropertiesParticle size, u APS 500 500 500 500Density 0.924 0.894 0.894 0.874Melt index 12 1.1 1.1 1.5Crystallinity, 54.5 21 21 13Tensile modulus. psi 45,300 8900 8900 1160Tensile strength. psi 1570 840 840 290Elongation at break.
