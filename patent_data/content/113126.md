Then, by the cylinder piston unit 218, the forward movement or feeding of the jaws is caused within the hole F of the core A of a reel R, the pusher 250 and body 240 are moved to the left, as seen inFig. 9, against the spring 242. Then the jaw opening is caused by the cylinder piston unit 226 with the stem 228 . This movement causes the lever 246 to engage against the shoulder of the body bearing the spring pressure or force dash dot position , so that until the jaws are opened, the pusher is firmly retained at retracted position. Then, the jaws with the reel are displaced to the desidred position.For reel unloading or delivery, the jaws 234 are closed by the cylinder piston unit 226. This causes The inmediate release of the lever 246 of the both shoulder and therefore said body 24Q is rapidly rightward moved as urged by the spring, thereby imparting a push to the reel. Referring now to Figs. ll and 12, the skirting device 74 will be discussed about. The wheel 72 in Fig. 11 is schematically drawn b 7 dash lines.The position of a reel R carried on the wheel in the skirting station is also shown by dash lines. The skirting device 74 is stationary relative to the wheel axis and generally arranged to cooperate with a position of the reel at 450 relative to the gripping position, which is also horizontal.On a fixed framework 100, said skirting device comprises a pair of parallel arms 101 and 102, each of which carrying a lever skirting halfpan or p ate, 103 and 104, respectively each halfpan or plate is realized with the characteristic stepped cavity, such as 1041, and covers slightly less than one half of the reel facing area, so that a passage is left between the tJO half pans or plates for The incoming and outgoing reel carrying stem upon rotation of the wheel 72 according to arrow D. The arms 101 and 102 are slidable according to the axis thereof in bushes or sleeves, of which one is shown at 105, and are controlled by cylinder piston unit or the like. In front of said half pans or plates 103 and 104, and spaced apart therefrom, an upper pan or plate 106 with the characteristic steeped circular cavity 106 is arranged. The pan or plate 106 is integral with a stem 107 of the cylinder piston unit 108, so that both the lever half pans or plates and the upper pan or plate can be applied and pressed on an interposed reel R for skirting. Preferring next to Figs. 13 and 14, the transfer apparatus 76 for transferring reels and spacing discs will be described. the transfer apparatus 76 ccmprises a crosspiece 110 movable on a fixed structure not shown along its longitudinal axis, generally horizontally, by the cylinder piston unit 112. Said crosspiece 110 carries a first gripping member or pliers 114 and a second gripping member or pliers 116 spaced apart from each other and vertically movable by cylinder piston units 118 and 120, respectively. In an embodimer,t, only the menber 114 will be hereinafter described, since member 116 is substantially similar.Said member 114 comprises a pair of spreadable rods 121 and 122, pivoted to the pin 123 on a slider 324 and connected to an opening and closing cylinder piston unit 125 carried on the slide , by a pantograph system cxeprising angled extensions 1211, 122 of the rod. and link rods 126 and 127. The cross dimension of the rods is such that they can be slipped into the spaces left free between the rigid core of a reel R slipped onto a rod AR of a per se known dyeing basket 130.Such known basket rods are of substsntiallv three looed shape in cross section, while the reel core is circular in cross secti.oI . Preferably, the lefthand pliers rods 114 are preferably shorter to engage the hole portion in the reel core which is left free when the reel is on a gripping device of the wheel apparatus 72. A vertical guide system for said slider 124 provides splined rollers 131 for engagement with a corresponding profile on the slider. A similar guide system with rollers 132 is provided for a corresponding profile integral with the movable crosspiece 110. A second horizontal piston 136 provides for shock dampening, Figs. 15 18, and 19 20 respectively show variants to the gripping members or pliers 314 and 116. A reel gripping member 300 having a longitudinal axis a comprises a plurality of jaws 312, generally two or three. The jaws are movable between a closed position Figs. 15 of reel disengagement, in which they are against one another, and an open position not .shcs7n in which they engage the inner wall of a reel core.Fach jaw comprises a tang portion 314, which can be secured by scresÃ§s engaging the threaded holes 315 to an end elemert of a pantograph system, partly shown in Fig. 17, and not described as per se known for the operation of pliers and ns. The jaw also comprises a stem 316 and a half bulb engagement portion 318 with outer surface relieved with respect to the stem and of rounded tapered shape. Teeth 319, generally one for each jaw, outwardly extend from the bulb shape. A halfoircle pan or plate 320 is secured on the stem of each naw, with the edge relieved to the jaw gripping end. The pan or plate 320 serves as an abutment or stop to the jaw slipping and contributes to retain the reel on the jaw at correct position. The distance h between the pan or plate and the end of the engagement portion is generally substantially less than the height of a reel, so that reels still slipped on a rod and retained lifted thereon can be engaged. According to the variant of Fig. 17, the profile of the stem portion and bulb portion 316 and 318 remains identical, while for each jaw the pan or plate 320 is replaced by an inclined bent sheet portion Fig. 18 also serving as an abutment or stop for the reel.It is generally deemed that a member as shown in Figs. 15 and 16 is more suitable for conical reels, while a member as shown in Figs. 17 and 18 is more suitable for cylindrical reels. Ry driving devices not shown the gripping member is lowered into the hole of a reel rnre until the reel comes in touch with the abutrrent. Then, the jaws are widened out to firmly engage the inner wall of the core, such an engagement preventing the reels from, oscillating, which oscillations could cause the jamning of the automatic process for reel handling. A gripping member 400 for spacing discs DS one of which by only way of illustration is partly shown in Fig. 19 comprises a plurality of jaws 412, generally in a number of tn. Each jaw ccoprises a tang portion 414, a stem portion 416 and a gripping head 418. The tang portion is intended for connection by screws engaging in threaded holes 415 to an end element of a pantograph system not shown, because per se knows for use as control for gripping members which system controls the jaw opening and closing. The gripping head 418 comprises a stop ridge 410, generally but not necessarily in the form of circular crown portion and generally including a pan or plate we ded to the meeker and having an abutment surface 420 , with a larger diameter than that of the hole of disc DS. The gripping head also comprises a recessed seat 421, generally of circular surface, and a retaining ridge or end tooth 422 radially extended, which is also generallv but not necessarily in the form of an arc of circle, as seen in plan view. The diameter of the end tooth is at least slightly less than that of the disc hole. The lower surface of said head 418 is preferably convex or tapered to assist in centering a disc to be taken up. In the preferred embodiment, each jaw has the ridge or pan of semicircular shape, and also the seat and ridge 422 are of semicircular shape, so that each of these elements will form a complete circle when the jawÃ§ are approached to each other however, other s iapes in plan vi7 ale possible both for the stop ridge and tooth and seat. Preferablv, the tss7c jaws join each other along ar axial plane of the rn Tber. In operation, the gripping member is lowered on a pile of discs and by the gripping head 418 is inserted bito the hole of an upper disc by a distance as determined by the pan or plate 420. The jaws open and the head engages a disc Ds. The engaged disc is lifted, while being retained within the seat between the ridge 420 arE tooth 422, and can be easily transported without any oscillations. Preferably, the device 76 operates simultaneously with the pliers 114 and 116 While the pliers 114 farrow E in Fig. 2 drawor withdraw a reel frcn the wheel 72, the pliers 116 places a spacing disc on a rod AR when filling up the dyeing basket 130 position shown by full line in Fig. 2 then the crosspiece craves to bring the pliers 114 arrow F on the vertical of rod AR to unload the reel and the pliers 116 on the vertical of a magazine rod 140 supporting the spacing discs DS for the reels dashed position .It is possible to preset the pliers 114 and 116 at a fixed distance from each other and the distances between the devices 72, 130 and AD are accordingly set, or a change in distance between the pliers 114 and 116 can be preset.In order to lift the piles of discs DS, an arm 142 is provided, which can be lifted in any knawn manner. Should the discs or pans carried on a single store rod be insufficient, a magazine rod supplying apparatus 510 is provided, as shown in Figs. 24 26. The magazine rods or disc carrying rods are indicated at 511.Each macjazine rod has a foot 511 comprising an elongated plate. The supply apparatus 510 for magazine rods 511 cccrrises on a fixed structure 512 a continuous conveyor, such as a plate chain conveyor means 514. Preferably the conveyer 514 comprises two chains 514a and 514b movable as a unitary body. A movement direction is shown by the arrow in Fig. 24. The chain means turns about pairs of gear wheels 516, of which a pair such as that shown in the figures will obviously be the drive pair for the chains. Pockets 518 are mounted on longitudinally spaced apart plates of the chain conveyor means for example, as shown in the figure, on one plate out of three each pocket comprises a flattened sleeve, having a through opening of dimensions for receiving the foot 511 of a rod 511, and having a U shaped slot at the top to receive the rod 5l1, enabling the sliding thereof to a central position on the conveyor.Both the sleeve opening and slot preferably have an auis transverse to the chain forward r overent. The size ratio of the rod foot and sleeve 518 is such that the foot projects on one and the other end of the sleeve that is on one and the other side of the chain means, so as to bear on side guide rails 520 made integral with the fixed framework 512 and in the case coated with a strip 522 of polytetrafluoroethylene or other antifriction material. Of course, the shape of the engagement seats or pockets for the rod foot could be other than that shown. The advancement of the chain conveyer means 514 is stepwise, generally each step being equal to the center distance between one pocket and the next pocket. The apparatus may also comprise ejecting means 524 including a cylinder piston unit 525 moving transversely of the chains the movable element of the cylinder piston unit carries a pushing head 526, preferably with a seat 526 for partially enclosing the contour of rod 511. Initially, the apparatus 510 is loaded with a plurality of disc carrying rods, for example filled r. th discs. The discs of a first rod 511, at predetermined position relative to a dyeing basket, the rods of which orthogonal to the drawing sheet in Fig. 2 are filled with reels R, are first gripped one by one and positioned on the reels. Where the rod is depleted, the chain means moves forward by one step and the discs are drawn one by one from a next rod 511. The unloaded rods 511 move to the ejector 524 which provides for removal thereof from the pockets. The apparatus may also be used for reel unloading in such a case it is loaded with empty rods, and the latter are then filled and ejected. In conventional systems t rails piled up on each rod are clamped by clamping devices known in the art. I,iihout going into unnecessary operating details, the knawn reel clamping device comprises a block, provicled with a through opening of sufficient size for the rod passage, and an operating lever etended front the block, as wrll as a spring means for pressing against the reels a retaining collar. With the clamping device arranged with vertical axis, as generally used, a lifted position of the lever corresponds to a free condition of the device, whereas a lowered position of the lever, as obtained by gravity in the absence of external forces, corresponds to a clamped position of the device. In Figs. 21, 22 and 23, referents numeral 602 denotes a conventional clasping device, comprising a block 603, a lever 604, a cone co lar 605 urge by a spring 606 about a cylindrical extension 607 of the body. The lever is shown at lowered clamping condition.Reference an indicates a reel carrying rod of a dyeing basket, R a reel slipped onto the rod at a top end position, and P a spacing pan or disc for the reels of corrmon use. The applying removing apparatus 61C for devices 602 substantially ccnprises a fixed franNvork 612 having a guide or pair of guides 614.A carriage 616 is rr . able on the guide 614 under control of a cylinder piston unit or other operatinG means, not shown. This carriage 616 caries a cylinder piston unit 618 or other operating means, the movable element 620 of which is vertically displaceable and also carries vertical guides 622. By a linkage 624 a frame 626 is cc,nIiected to the end of the stern or movable element 620, which frame 62G is guided for vertical movemert on guides 622. Said frame 626 has a centering or positioner member 628 secured thereto, generally ccmprising a cylinder with opening for positioning with reduced clearance about the end of rod A. Frame 626 also has two opposite walls 627 at the bottom terminating with guide walls 628. Each wall 627 carries an operating means 630, for example a cylinder piston unit, with the movable element integral with a jaw, the two jaws being shown at 632, 633. The jaws 632, 633 can slide near and away from each other. Secured to one side thereof, said jaw 633 carries a cam or tab 634, having an inclined top surface 635, which is lowest at the fartiermost cnd of the jaw and highest at the nearest end. Each of the jaws have a gripping surface 632 and 633 for embracing part of the circumference of the device 602. For the apylication of each device 602, when the slider 616 is displaced, for example to the left on guide 614, the jaws 632 and 633 draw a device 602 presented at the top by a magazine column not shc in of devices 602 piled up on a rod. The position of the cam 634 is at the lever 604 with respect to the block 603 of said device 602 so that the cam engages the lever, which is thereby retained at lifted condition and the device is in unclasped free condition. while suitable position abutments of a per se knawn type may be provided, said slider 616 moves along the guide 614 to be arranged on the veft..zcal of a rod AR filled i p with reels R. The cylinder piston unit 618 lowers the frame 626 to slip the centering member 628 about the end of rod AR. Possibile position adjustments are allowed by articulation 624 As the centering member 628 is fixed to the frame 626, then the position of the jaws and cam relative to the device is automatically established. Then, the jaws 632 and 633 are spread out to each other to allow for lowering of lever 604 by grafity as well as block 603 of the device 602. Thus, the apparatus 610 is lifted. The removal of the device 602 is carried out as follows the cylinder piston unit 618 lowers the frame 626 on the rod AR the jaws 632 and 633 move near each other, so that the lever 6C4 is lifted on the profile 635 of cam 634, thereby releasing the device 602 which, as gripped by the jaws, is then lifted away. A support or mounting is provided for the dyeing basket 130, ccirprising a slide 144 Fig. 2 and an indexing fixture 146 angularly snapwise movable or indexed to present in turn at loading position each of the reel carrying rods AR. The slide and indexing fixture will not be herein described in detail as they may be of any knawn type. In order that each rod AR should be held at upright or straight attitude at the time of reel loading, a centering apparatus 78 in provided, to be discussed about in the following in connection with reel unloading. In connection with the unloading of a basket after dyeing, use may be made of the same loading unit of Fig. 2. However, it is preferred to have a separate basket unloading unit 70 , schematically shown in Fig. 3. In addition to a reel centering lifting apparatus 78 similar to apparatus 78, this unit 70 comprises a transfer apparatus 76 which is .s tstantiallv identical to apparatus 76 and Therefore not further described, and a wheel apparatus 72 similar to apparatus 72 and not further described. Referring to Figs. 27 to 30, the centering lifting device 78 or 78 will now be described. It comprises twn centering arms 152 and 154, each of which rotatable about its own vertical pin 156 and 158.The arms have a notch or cavity equal to a semicircumference of rodAR and in Fig. 29 are shown by thicker line at widened position and by thinner line at approached position about a rod AR. Opening and closing of the arms is caused by a cylinder piston unit, such as 160.The centering arms and opening pistons thereof are carried on a plate 162 vertically mo Table by cylinder piston unit 164 located on a fixed plate 165. The reel lifting means comprise. an arm 170 having a notch or cavity of larger circmference than that of rod AR. Said arm 170 is rotatable about a vertical axis and liftable as desired. in the example shown it is carried on a stem 171, in turn rotatably carried within a tube of square cros. section 172. Rotatably controlled rollers 173 provide for lifting and lowering of said tube 172 and 171. The latter may be rotated as desired about its own axis within the tube, thus rotating said arm 17C. Said apparatus 78 is identical to apparatus 78 , except that the reel lifting device may he dispensed with. The operation of the system will now be described. Treatment is carried out for reel from the spoiler or packaging packs. A plurality of reels are simultaneously loaded by hoist and net on the 3 oading plane or inclinable table 12 at the most various positions and may also be superirrposed to one another. Upon loading, the operator activates the control of air flow to the pistons 26 and 27, which raise the table and cause the reels to slide and lie down on said table and on table 14 to the rotating drum 16, stopping thereat. When some iiurrber f reels has been achieved, the automatic control device 56 operates the motor of the rotating drum 16.The dnun rotates and stops after a rotation of 900. A proximity switch, not shown, de energizes the motor and operates the piston 34. In rotation, said drum 16 lies down a nutter of reals on the section 18 and piston 34 pushes the same, with reel axis at the most various positions, on the section 20 with the belt in fast. forward msvement. The simultaneous push action of the piston and particolar stnlcture of section 20 arrange all of the reels with horizontal axis with respect to ground and spaced apart from onc another.In case of conical reels, at this position the reels may have the major base or the mirior base ahead, but they should have the major base ahead for correct gripping by the wheel device. A tilter device in case of conical reels , here not shown in detail, ccflperates with the section 22 to orderly arrange reels, at the outlet fran section 22, aligned with the major base ahead. The station 24 operates intermittently, as the motor is controlled by the photocell 60 whenever a reel is drawn from the station 24.The reel enters said station 24 since it is provided with SOme kinetic energy imparted thereto by the conveyor belts 46 and 48, and the photocell 58 located on the belt 46, where the reels are spaced apart, senses the passage thereof. The wheel like drawing positioning apparatus 72 takes by each gripping means in turn said reels R. The drawing positioning apparatus rotates through 450 carrying the reel to the skirting station. In such a station, skirting operation is carried out by means of half pans 103 and 104 and pan or plate 106, which move near one another compressing the reel edges. A further rotation through 450 of the wheel brings the reel to a position wherein it has a vertical axis, ready to be drawn and slipped on a rod AR of the dyling basket 13C. The pliers 114 of the device 76 draw the reel R. At the same time, the pliers 116 allOw a disc previously gripped from the disc supply to drop on rod AR. Then, the crosspiece of device 76 moves rightward position shcwn by dashed line in Fig. 2 and at such a position the pliers 114 all the reel to drop on the rod AR presented to loading, while the pliers 116 draw a new disc. Thus, the cycle is continued to carplete filling of a rod AR of the basket. A clamping device 602 in secured to the rod by apparatus 610, whereupon an automatic control provides to rotate the basket carrying slide to present the next rod to loading. During loading, the centering apparatus closes the arms accurately positioning the rod end. After loading of each reel, the arms 152 and 154 open to allow the reel to fall down along the rod. when the basket 130 is completely filled up with reels, the basket is introduced into an empty dyeing cabinet. At unloading, the reels are lifted along each rod AR by the lifting device and are drawn from the rods AR by the apparatus 76 and slipped on the gripping members of the wheel 72 . The discs are removed and piled up on the rod AD by the disc pliers. From the wheel 72 the reels may be positioned on hydroextractor cage.
