# Gas burner.

## Abstract
A gas burner comprising a burner plate 3 arranged within a closed combustion chamber 2 , a mixing chamber 4 having a gas inlet 5 and an air inlet 6 located at the side of the burner plate reverse to that of the combustion chamber and a fan 7 for feeding the gas air mixture from the mixing chamber through the apertures of the burner plate in the combustion chamber. The gas burner is provided with a burner plate having a low thermal conductivity, a redox detector 9 arranged within the combustion chamber above the burner plate and an electronic control unit 10 producing one or more output signals for controlling the supply of gas and or air to the mixing chamber of the burner in response to the output signal of the redox detector being applied to its input. These latter provisions permit the burner to be operated with widely differing loads and gas composi tions whilst maintaining an extremely low excess of air in the gas air mixture resulting in correspondingly low CO and NO
