In addition, aromatic bis ether anhydride s also included by the above formula are shown by Koton,M.M. Florinski, F.S. Bessonov, M.I. Rudakov, A.P. Institute of Heteroorganic Compounds, Academy ofSciences, U.S.S.R. , U.S.S.R. 257,010, Nov. llr 1969,Appl. May 3, 1967. In addition, dianhydrides are shown by M.M. Koton, F.S. Florinski, Zh Org. Khin, 4 5 , 774 1968 . Organic diamines of the above formula include, for example, m phenylenediamine, pphenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, benzidine, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5 diaminonaphthalene, 3,3 dimethylbenzidine, 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine, 2,4 bis b amino t butyl toluene, bis amino t butylphenyl ether, bis p methyl o aminopentyl benzene, 1,3 diamino 4 isopropylbenzene, 1,2 bis 3 aminopropoxy ethane, m xylylenediamine, pxylylenediamine, 2,4 diaminotoluene, 2,6diaminotoluene, bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane, 3methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 2,11 dodecanediamine, 2,2 dimethylpropylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 3methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,5dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3methylheptamethylenediamine, 5 methylnonamethylenediamine, 1,4 cyclohexanediamine, l,12 octadecanedia mine, bis 3 aminopropyl sulfide, Nmethyl bis 3 aminopropyl amine, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis 3aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane, bis 4aminobutyl tetramethyldisiloxane, and the like, and mixtures of such diamines.

Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the aforementioned dianhydrides with any of the aforementioned diamino compounds while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 2000 to 4000C. and preferably 2300 to 3000C. can be employed.Any order of addition of chain stoppers ordinarily employed in melt polymerization can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight1 intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups.Generally, useful polyetherimides have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 250C. Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.Heath et al. 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al. 3,850,885, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. The polyetherimides may also be prepared by the reaction of a bis nitrophthalimide and an alkali metal salt of an organic compound, a dihydric phenol and an alkali phenoxide, or the reaction of an aryloxysubstituted bisphthalimide, as disclosed in U.S.Patents Nos. 3,887,58 to Cook et al. 4,017,511 toWilliams and 4,024,110 to Takekoshi, incorporated herein by reference. The polyarylates used in the blends of the subject invention can be made by a variety of methods.For example, an interfacial polycondensation can be used in which an aqueous alkaline solution a pH above about 7 to about 13 of a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalide mixture dissolved in a water immiscible organic solvent are mixed and reacted. Typical interfacial polycondensation procedures are disclosed, for example, in W.M. Eareckson, J. Polymer Sci., XL 399 1959 . According to a typical polycondensation procedure, an aqueous alkaline solution of dihydric phenol is added to the dihalide mixture, dissolved in an organic solvent, or an organic solvent solution of the dihalide mixture is added to an aqueous alkaline solution of diphenol and the system then is polymerized. Alternatively, an aqueous alkaline solution of the dihydric phenol and a water immiscible organic solvent solution of the dihalide mixture can be simultaneously fed into a reaction vessel. Interfacial polycondensation takes place near the interface of the aqueous phase and the organic phase. However, since the aqueous phase and the organic phase are essentially immiscible, it is necessary to mutually disperse the phases with, for example, an agitator or a mixer such as a homomixer. The concentration of the dihalide mixture dissolved in the organic solvent is usually about 2 to about 25 by weight, preferably 3 to 15 by weight.The concentration of the dihydric phenol in the aqueous alkaline solution is also usually about 2 to about 258 by weight, preferably 3 to 15 by weight. The amounts of diphenol and the terephthaloyl dihalide mixture are such that the molar ratio between them is preferably maintained equivalent. An excess of the dihalide mixture is generally not desirable in the preparation of high molecular weight e.g., about 1 x 104 aromatic copolyesters. Preferred alkalis are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The concentration of the alkali in the aqueous solution can vary considerably depending upon the reaction conditions but usually ranges from about 0.5 to about 10 by weight. Advantageously, the quantity of the alkali is nearly equivalent to the hydroxy groups of the diphenol used or the alkali is present in a slight excess. Hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons can be used as water immiscible organic solvents for the dihalide mixture. Examples of suitable organic solvents are methylene dichloride, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, benzene and methylbenzene. Especially preferred are those solvents which also dissolve the polyarylate produced.Methylene dichloride is the most preferred solvent. The reaction temperature may vary considerably but it is preferably below about 400C Reaction temperatures of 5 to 300C. are especially preferred. The interfacial polymerization is usually performed at normal atmospheric pressure, and is completed in about 1 to 30 hours. A catalyst and a viscosity stabilizer are in general employed. Examples o catalysts which can be used include quaternary ammonium compounds, tertiary sulfonium compounds, quaternary phosphonium compounds, quaternary arsonium compounds, and tertiary amine compounds. Suitable viscosity stabilizers are, for example, monohydric phenols such as o phenyl phenol, p phenyl phenol, m cresol, p tert butyl phenol, 2phenyl 2 hydroxy phenylpropane and naphthol. The amour of catalyst used ranges from about 0.01 to about 1 mol based on the diphenol and the amount of viscosity stabile. ranges from about 0.5 to about 5 mol based on the diphenol. Another useful method for forming polyarylates is melt polymerization as disclosed, for example, in A. Coni Ind. Eng. Chem., 51, 147 1959 , Japanese Patent Publicat 15247 1963 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,395,119. Melt polymerization can be performed, for example, reacting an aliphatic carboxylic acid diester of the dihydric phenol, e.g., as described above, with the aroma polycarboxylic acid at an elevated temperature under reduc pressure. Melt polymerization can also be carried out by reacting the diphenol and a mixture of a diaryl ester of acid while heating. A typical diaryl ester is the diphen ester. The reaction temperature employed is in the range about 1500 to about 3500C., preferably 1800 to 3200C. The reaction pressure is usually varied in the course of the reaction from atmospheric pressure at the early stage of reaction to reduced pressure, for example, below about 0. mmHg, toward the end of the reaction.The melt polymerization is completed, in general, in about 2 to abc 8 hours. A number of catalysts can be used in the react ion and preferred catalysts include titanium compounds such as butyl ortho titanate and titanium dioxide. Other catalysts such as zinc oxide, lead oxide and diantimony trioxide can also be used. Still another method for forming polyarylates is solution polymerization in which the polyarylate is prepared by reacting the diphenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalide and in a water immiscible organic solvent. Useful solution polymerization procedures are disclosed, for example, in A. Conix,Ind. Eng. Chem., 51, 147 1959 , and U.S. Pat. No.3,133,898. In solution polymerization, the dihydric phenol and the acid dihalide are usually mixed in equimolar proportions in a water immiscible organic solvent, and the mixture is gradually heated to high temperatures of, for example, about 220 C. Preferably, the solvent used is one which also dissolves the polyarylate formed, such as dichloroethylbensene. Usually, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base to neutralize the hydrogen halide, for example, hydrogen chloride, formed. Suitable examples of the bases which can be used include a tertiary amine such ,as trimethylamine, triethylamine, etc., and pyridine. In accordance with the present invention, useful blends of a polyetherimide and a polyarylate are generally obtainable in all proportions of the two polymers relative to each other. By controlling the proportions of polyetherimide and polyarylate relative to each other, blends having certain predetermined properties which are improved over those of either a polyetherimide or a polyarylate alone are readily obtained. Consequently, blends comprising from about 1 to about 99 , by weight, polyetherimide and from about 99 to about 1 by weight, polyarylate are included within the scope of the invention. In general, blends of polyetherimides and polyarylates can be tailored to provide desired chemical and or physical characteristics by selecting appropriate proportion of blend components. Higher proportions of polyetherimide usually contribute higher mechanical properties and higher heat distortion temperatures for the blend. Higher proportions of polyarylate generally provide higher impact strength for the blend. Clarity of the blend is generally maintained regardless of the relative proportions of the blend components.Furthermore, since the blends of the invention have improved molding performance characteristics than the blend components alone as evidenced by lower molding pressures, the blends flow longer distances and can be used to mold thinner parts and parts of a more complex shape It is contemplated that the polyetherimidepolyarylate blends of the present invention may also include additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, flexibilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. It is also contemplated that the blends of the invention may include two or more polyetherimides with one or more polyarylates or two or more polyarylates in combination with one or more polyetherimides. Methods for forming polyetherimidepolyarylate blends may vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular or filamentous form, extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermoplastic compositions. The polyetherimide polyarylate blends of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, coil and cable wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends. can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heatresistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures. Films made from the subject polyetherimide polyarylate blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc. and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and provide a continuous resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene r etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated foT these blends include their use as b inders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends of the invention by incorporating suc fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica, and the like, into the blends prior to molding. Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. The following examples illustrate specific polyetherimide polyarylate blends in accordance with the present invention. It should be understood that the examples are given for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention. In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I A polyetherimide polyarylate blend according to the invention was prepared, molded into test specimens and tested for various physical properties. The polyetherimide was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphen6xy phenyl propane and mphenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 2500 to about 300 C. and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer was extruded at about 3000C.to form a strand and mechanically chopped into pellets,A test specimen was injection molded from the pellets at a temperature of 363 3720C. During molding, the molding machine guage pressure was noted to provide a relative indication of the pressure necessary to mold the test specimen. The polyarylate used in forming the blend was a polyarylate sold commercially under the trade name ARDELD 100 by Union Carbide Corporation which is the reaction product of bisphenol A and a mixture of terephthalic acid chloride and isophthalic acid chloride. A test specimen for comparative purposes was injection molded from pellets of the polyarylate at a temperature of 363 372 C. The blend was prepared by mixing the two polymers in a proportion of about 75 parts polyetherimide and about 25 parts polyarylate and then extruding the mixture in aWerner Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from 324 3440C. The resulting extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded at 363 3720C., into test specimens having dimensions of 63.5 x 12.7 x 3.2 mm., the latter dimension being the specimen thickness. Impact strengths of these specimens as well as of the specimens of polyarylate and of polyetherimide were measured according to the notched Izod test, ASTM D256, and the results are set forth in Table I.The heat distortion temperature, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and molding machine gauge pressure recorded during molding of the specimens were also measured and are given in Table I both for the pure components and for the blend. EXAMPLE II The procedure of Example I was repeated with the exception that about 50 parts of polyetherimide were mixed with about 50 parts of polyarylate to produce the blend according to the invention. The results of the notched Izod impact test, as well as the appearance, heat distortion temperature, flexural strength, flexural modulus and gauge molding pressure for test specimens of the blend are detailed in TableI. EXAMPLE III The procedure of Example I was repeated with the exception that about 25 parts of polyetherimide were blended with about 75 parts of polyarylate to produce the blend according to the invention. The results of the notched Izod impact test, as well as the appearance, heat distortion temperature, flexural strength, flexural modulus and molding pressure for test specimens of the blend are detailed in Table I.

In addition, the blends have improved molding performance characteristics over either of the components of the blends. Substitution of other polyetherimides and or other polyarylates for the polyetherimide and or polyarylate of the blends of the above examples can result in the formulation of polyetherimide polyarylate polymer blends having similar characteristics such as improved mechanical properties and molding pressure profiles and such blends are considered within the scope of the invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
