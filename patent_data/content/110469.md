# X ray analysis apparatus comprising a four crystal monochromator.

## Abstract
In order to achieve a high resolution in an X ray anal ysis apparatus, use is made of a monochromator compris ing four crystals which are pair wise positioned in parallel orientation, the two pairs being positioned in a mutual anti parallel orientation. In order to achieve a high beam intens ity, the radiation source may be arranged in the immediate vicinity of the first crystal pair. Each of the crystal pairs is preferably cut so as to form a U shape from a single block of monocrystalline material relatively free from dislocations, preferably germanium.
