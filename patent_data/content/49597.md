# Method and apparatus for pouring metal into an ingot mould.

## Abstract
A light weight ingot mould mat 6 for receiving molten metal is formed from sheets 2 of metal compatible with the molten metal. The sheets 2 have closely spaced holes 4 therein throughout most of their area so that they are very light and easily crumpled to form a honeycombed structure. The mat 6 is placed on a mould stool 22 and absorbs the force of the molten metal and chills it so that it freezes sufficiently to seal the joint between the stool 22 and moult 20 . The mat 6 is melted and absorbed into the ingot.
