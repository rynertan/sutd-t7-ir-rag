## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYOLEFIN FOAMS This invention relates to a process for making polyethylene foams using certain volatile organic compounds as blowing agents to give closed cell foams composed largely of substantially uniform fine cells. It is well known to make closed cell polyethylene foams by LIle process of extu iuii foaming wherein a normally solid polyethylene is heat plastified and mixed under pressure with a volatile material such as 1,2 dichlorotetrafluoroethane to form a flowable gel which is then passed through a shaping orifice or die opening into a zone of lower pressure Boyer et al. U.S. Patent 3,327,031 describes one such process modified by mechanical shearing means to provide a super fine cell structure. It discloses more than forty suitable blowing agents including l chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and l chloro 2,2,2 trichloroethane. Yet extrusion technology is a highly empirical art. As shown herein, the blowing agents ofU.S.Patent 3,327,031 are not as a class effective in producing dimensionally stable foams of low density polyethylene. One of the common requirements for acceptable foam resin products is dimensional stability, i.e., it is desired that the linear dimensions and thus the volume of a piece of foam resin not change appreciably, either to shrink or to expand, under ordinary conditions, from the time its manufacture is complete until the time its ultimate useful life is ended. 1,2 Dichlorotetrafluoroethane has been used successfully to produce various commercial closed cell polyethylene foams. However, 1,2 dichlorotetrafluoroethane has recently been cited as a potential environmental hazard related to depleting the earth s stratospheric ozone layer.Thus alternate blowing agents are desirable. In accordance with this invention, a normally solid polyethylene is heat plastified and mixed under pressure with i cbloro l 2 2 tetrafluoroethane or preferably l chloro l,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane to form a flowable gel which is then passed through a die opening into a zone of significantly low pressure to cause expansion of the gel to form a dimensionally stable fine cell substantially closed cell polyethylene foam.The volatile blowing agent can be employed in an amount corresponding to from 0. 02 to 0.31, preferably from 0.04 to 0.22, gram mole of l chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethane or l chloro l,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane per 100 grams of polyethylene. Any normally solid, heat plastifiable polyethylene can be employed in making the foams by the process of this invention. In practice the polyethylene foams are prepared by placing the molten polyethylene under pressure of the l chloro 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane or 1 chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethane blowing agent such as by heating the materials in admixture with one another in a pressure resistant vessel at temperatures between about 90 and 200 C, suitably at a temperature at least as high as the melting point of the polymer, until a uniform or substantially uniform flowable gel is obtained. The temperature at which the gel is extruded will vary depending primarily upon the melting point of the polyethylene and the proportions of the polyethylene and the 1 chloro 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane or l chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethane employed. In general, the gel can be extruded at a temperature of from about 25 C below the perature at which crystallization of the polyethylene causes an observable cloudiness of the gel to a temperature of 250C or higher above the melting point of the polyethylene.The temperature at which crystallization of the polyethylene causes a cloudiness of the gel can readily be determined by sealing weighed amounts of the polyethylene and the l chloro 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane or l chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethane in a glass tube, heating the mixture to a temperature above the melting point of the polyethylene to obtain a transparent uniform gel, then cooling or allowing the gel to cool and observing the temperature at which the gel becomes hazy or cloudy. The temperature at which an observable cloudiness of the gel occurs is herein referred to as the cloud point . The process can be carried out batchwise or in continuous manner. In a preferred practice for making a polyethylene foam in a continuous manner, the normally solid polyethylene suitably in granular form is fed to a plastics extruder wherein it is heat plastified and blended with the volatile 1 chloro 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoro ethane or l chloro 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethane blowing agent under pressure in a desired proportion to form a homogeneous flowable composition, which composition is brought to a substantially uniform temperature between about 90 and 2O00C throughout its mass and is thereafter extruded or discharged through a suitable orifice into a zone of lower pressure, e.g. the atmosphere, wherein the extruded material expands to form a cellular body which is cooled and cut into pieces suitable for convenient liaiidliiig. Finely divided solid materials such as calcium silicate, zinc stearatet magnesium stearate and the like and mixtures thereof can advantageously be incorporated with the polymer or gel prior to expanding the same. Such finely divided materials aid in controlling the size of the cells, and are usually employed in amounts up to 3 percent by weight of the polymer. The invention provides an improved and economical method for making cellular foams from polyethylene useful for a variety of purposes, e.g. as cushion packaging, flexible insulation or fillers for life jackets. The products possess a highly uniform fine cell structure consisting for the most part of thin walled individually closed cells, and are flexible, resilient, tough, chemically inert and have good dimensional stability. For the present purposes, dimensional stability of the foam refers to changes which occur in foam volume, particularly in later stages of manufacture and during subsequent storage of the foam product. The dimensional stability of the foam products is measured by observing the changes in volume occurring in a test specimen of the foam as a function of time. The test specimen is obtained by quickly cutting from the foam product soon after its formation, e.g. within five minutes, a test piece of foam and accurately measuring its overall volume, e.g. by cubic displacement of water. This initial volume is arbitrarily selected as the bench mark volume for dimensional stability tests.The foam specimen is exposed to air at atmospheric pressure and ordinary room temperature its volume is re measured from time to time and related on volume percentage basis to the initial volume. In general manufacturing practice, a polyolefin foam is considered to have acceptable dimensional stability if the minimum volume to which the foam body shrinks is not less than 85, preferably not less than 90, percent of the initial bench mark volume, and if the volume of the foam body four weeks, preferably three weeks, after its extrusion is not less than 90 percent of the initial volume and is substantially constant thereafter under ambient atmospheric conditions. The term dimensionally stable in reference to the subject polyethylene foams is used herein in the sense of the foregoing definitive description. The specific working examples that follow further illustrate the invention. In the examples, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified or required by the context.Example 1 Polyethylene foams were made by continuous extrusion from a conventional screw type extruder having 1.25 inch 3.2 cm diameter. The extruder comprises the usual sequential zones usually denominated feed zone, compression and melt zone, metering zone, and mixing zone. The barrel is provided with conventional electrical heaters for zoned control and wiUl usual instrumentation. The discha9a GZ of the mixing zone of the extruder is connected through a cooler providing a cooling and temperature control zone, to a die orifice having generally rectangular configuration 0.25 inch 0.64 cm wide with gap of approximately 0.15 inch 0.38 cm .An inlet opening for fluid blowing agent under pressure and feed rate control is provided in the process stream near the discharge end of the extruder. In practice, polyethylene resins in the form of common granules are fed through the feed hopper to the extruder at rate of approximately 12 pounds 5.44 kg per hour. The temperature in the metering zone is maintained at about lSO0C. Blowing agent is pumped into the inlet at predetermined rate under pressure to maintain liquid phase.The mixed mass of molten polymer and blowing agent is cooled in the temperature control zone to a substantially uniform temperature which is just above the temperature at which solid polyethylene would crystallize out of the gel before passing through the die orifice. The mass emerging from the die orifice to atmospheric pressure expands and forms a cellular foam which is continuously carried away from the die as the foam forms, cools and hardens to a strip of foamed, cellular, flexible solid resin approximately 1.0 inch 2.54 cm thick and 1.3 inches 3.30 cm wide. In the tests described below in this example, there was used a solid resinous polyethylene having density of 0,918 gram per cubic centimeter in the form of molding granules.They were mixed in a mixer with powdered zinc stearate and talc as foam nucleation and cell size control agent, in concentrations shown in TableI. The blowing agent comprised l chloro l,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane fed to the inlet at substantially constant rate as shown in Table I. For purposes of comparison, foams were also made using 1,2 dichlorotetrafluoroethane 1,1, l trifluoro 2 chloroethane and l chloro l, 1 difluoroethane blowing agents outside the scope of the invention.From the resulting extruded foam products there were cut rods at about 5 minutes after extrusion.These rods were about 8 inches 20.3 cm long in the direction of the extrusion, about 1.3 inches 3.30 cm wide and about 1.0 inch 2.54 cm thick. Four of such rods were joined together into bundles. The overall volumes of these bundles were promptly and accurately measured by cubic displacement of water. Their apparent or bulk density was also measured and computed as pounds per cubic foot kg m3 as recorded in Table I. The volumes of the bundles were re measured at different time intervals as hereinbefore described these volumes, as percentages of the initial volume, are recorded in Table I.
