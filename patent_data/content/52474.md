# Interpolymers of polyurethanes and addition polymerizable monomers.

## Abstract
Interpolymerizate of polyurethane forming ingredients polyol, polyisocyanate and free radical addition polymeriz able monomers, at least one of which contains an hydroxyl group e.g., styrene plus 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate . The interpolymer is prepared in the presence of a catalyst for polyurethane formation and a free radical addition polymer ization catalyst. Product is homogeneous and insoluble. System is useful in reaction injection molding processes.
