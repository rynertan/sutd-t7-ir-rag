## Description
PIGMENT DISPERSANTS, PIGMENT CONCENTRATES, AND THEIR USE IN AQUEOUS COATING COMPOSITIONS AND PRINTING INKS. This invention relates to pigment dispersants to dispersed pigment concentrates and to aqueous pigmented coating compositions and printing inks in which the dispersed pigment concentrates may be used. It is conventional for pigments to be dispersed in an aqueous medium, or in a medium miscible with water, with the aid of a pigment dispersant. It is desirable that the pigment dispersant used has good hydrolytic stability under the conditions of use or storage of the dispersion since hydrolysis of the dispersant may have an adverse effect on the paint, ink or other product in which it is used. Dispersed pigment concentrates are commercially available which are suitable for use in tinting aqueous coating compositions which contain a film forming material. However, the commercially available dispersed pigment concentrates often contain low molecular weight water soluble dispersant constituents. When these concentrates are employed in the formulation of aqueous coating compositions such as emulsion paints, staining may occur on the surface of an applied coating which is subjected to conditions of high humidity for example in a bathroom due to the leaching of certain pigments. We have now found that certain water dispersible polymers comprising urethane groups are very effective as pigment dispersants in aqueous medium that they have good hydrolytic stability and that they resist the leaching of pigment from an applied coating under humid conditions. According to this invention we provide a polymeric water dispersible pigment dispersant which is prepared by interacting at a temperature of not greater than 1500C materials which comprise a a carboxylic acid of structureEMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 Cn H2n X, the same or different and wherein n 1 8 and X is a group reactive with an isocyanate group, and wherein R3 is a C1 8 alkyl or substituted alkyl group, b an aliphatic polyol, and c a di or tri isocy√°nate According to another aspect of this invention we provide a dispersed pigment concentrate which comprises water and or a liquid miscible with water, pigment and a water dispersible polymeric pigment dispersant prepared by interacting materials as defined above. According to a further aspect of this invention we provide an aqueous pigmented coating composition which comprises water, pigment, a water dispersible polymeric pigment dispersant prepared as defined above, and a coating material. According to another aspect of this invention we provide an aqueous printing ink which comprises water, pigment, a water dispersible polymeric pigment dispersant prepared as defined above and a film forming material. The group X may be for example a hydroxyl, amino, imino or mercapto group. Preferably X is a hydroxyl group.More preferably n 1 3. In one preferred embodiment of the invention R1 R2 are each CH2OH and R3 is CH3, i.e.the carboxylic acid is dimethylolpropionic acid. Preferably the polyol is a diol and suitable diols include ethylene glycol propylene glycol diethylene glycol dipropylene glycol poly propylene glycols , for example of molecular weight in the range 300 2000 and poly ethylene glycols butane 1 4 diol and hexane 1 6 diol.Other suitable polyols include glycerol, trimethylolpropane tr imethy lo 1 ethane diphenylol propanet and pentaerythritol. Particularly suitable polyols are the poly propylene glycols . Mixtures of polyols may be used.The triols and higher polyols may be used in the form of a monoester or polyester respectively, provided that two hydroxyl groups remain present. Preferably the pigment dispersant also comprises a C8 20 aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety, which may be derived from a natural oil, for example castor oil, soya bean oil, coconut oil, linseed oil, dehydrated castor oil and isomerised oils such as isomerised safflower oil. The hydrocarbon moiety may be saturated or unsaturated. The hydrocarbon moiety may be introduced into the pigment dispersant by using a further reactant material d , for example a natural oil such as castor oil, or a derivative thereof, for example a monoglyceride, or an adduct of ethylene oxide with an amine derived by hydrogenation from a natural fatty acid. Alternatively the aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety may be introduced into the pigment dispersant as a constituent of the polyol as mentioned above, for example as a monoester of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid with glycerol, trimethylol propane or trimethylol ethane or as a mono or di ester of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid and pentaerythritol. Suitable diisocyanates include tolylene diisocyanate as the 2 4 or 2 6 isomers and mixtures thereof hexamethylene diisocyanate diphenylmethane diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate. Suitable triisocyanates include adducts of diisocyanates with polyols, for example adducts of tolylene diisocyanate or hexamethylene diisocyanate with tr imethy lolpropane. The interaction of the materials a , b and c , optionally material d and optionally other materials is carried out under conditions which are appropriate to the reaction between an isocyanate group and the isocyanate reactive group X, which is preferably a hydroxyl group, to form a urethane group. An important aspect of this invention is that there appears to be little reaction between an isocyanate group and the carboxyl group of the carboxylic acid a at temperatures 0 not greater than about 150 C, although preferably the temperature of interaction is not greater than about 1300C 0 and more preferably not greater than 100 C.The propor tions of the ingredients are selected by conventional procedures for the preparation of polyurethanes and preferably so that after the reaction there is a negligible residue of unreacted isocyanate groups. Preferably the molecular weight of the polymeric pigment dispersant is greater than 2,000 and more preferably in the range 3,000 10,000. The selection of an appropriate carboxylic acid, aliphatic polyol, di or tri isocyanate and optional CB2O aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety will depend, for example, upon the nature of the pigment to be dispersed and upon the nature of the aqueous medium in which dispersion is to be achieved. There must be taken into account the known principles whereby a suitable balance of hydrophilic lyophilic properties is achieved in the final polymer whilst ensuring the necessary dispersibility of the polymer in the aqueous medium. Preferably the pigment dispersant has an acid value of 15 100 mg KOH g and more preferably of 25 60 mgKOH g. The polymeric dispersant is dispersible in aqueous medium in the presence of a base. Useful bases include, for example,ammonia primary amines such as triethylamine hydroxy amines.such as 2 amino propanol, dimethylaminoethanol and mono , di and tri ethanolamine.Inorganic bases may also be used. In general the dispersant is neutralised with such bases to a pH in the range 5.5 to 9.0, preferably 7.0 to 8.5. The dispersed pigment concentrate may comprise water and or a wide range of non aqueous liquids for example ethylene or propylene glycols monohydric alcohols, for example ethanol or isopropanol glycol ethers, for example methyl or butyl Cellosolve and propylene glycol monoethyl ether. After the reaction between materials a , b and c has been effected it is usual then to remove unwanted solvent and to add water or other appropriate solvent and desired base to produce a solution of dispersant which is suitable for combination with a pigment to produce the dispersed pigment concentrate. The solution of the dispersant and the pigment may be mixed and dispersed by any conventional technique, for example by bead milling or ball milling. Suitable pigments include phthalocyanine blue and green pigments, titanium dioxide, iron oxide pigments and azo pigments. Extenders may also be present such as talc, china clay, barytes and chalk. Particularly appropriate pigments are the phthalocyanine pigments and the aryl amido azo pigments. The dispersed pigment concentrates of this invention have notable advantages over the commercially available concentrates, for example those based on waterdispersible polyesters. They have high tinctorial strength and may contain a high level of pigment the dispersant polymer has good hydrolytic stability and is compatible with a wide range of other water dispersible polymers and, particularly in coatings produced from emulsion paints, the dispersant polymer provides good resistance to the effects of water such as pigment leaching. Suitable coating materials which may be present in coating compositions according to the invention include polymers or copolymers prepared by emulsion, dispersion or solution polymerisation of for example, vinyl acetate and other vinyl esters, meth acrylic acids and esters thereof, styrene, ethylene, vinylidene chloride and mixtures of these monomers. Condensation polymers may also be used. The emulsion polymers are particularly suitable in the formulation of coating compositions according to the invention. Printing inks according to the invention may comprise a pigment concentrate together with one or more soluble or water insoluble polymers and any other conventional additive.
