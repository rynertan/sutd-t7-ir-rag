# Air to fuel ratio control system for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An electric type air to fuel ratio control system for an internal combustion engine in which the air to fuel ration sucked into the cylinders 10 of the engine is maintained substantially constant following abrupt deceleration. In accordance with the invention, a bypass flow of air is provided into the intake manifold of the engine downstream of the throttle valve 5 and a fuel injection valve 4 using an electrically controlled air supplying device 7 . The air supplying device 7 is opened following closure of the throttle valve 5 to supply an additional flow of air which compensates for overrichness in the air to fuel mixture caused by the delay of fuel injected from the fuel injection valve 4 to the cylinders 10 of the engine. Preferably, the time during which air is supplied through the air supplying device 7 and the flow rare of air therethrough is adjusted so as to maintain a predetermined air to fuel ration following deceleration.
