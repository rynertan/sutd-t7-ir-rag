# Improved wire drawing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a new method of, and apparatus for, drawing wire which uses a partial turn of wire wedged in an endless groove 32 in a rotating wheel 31 to generate the necessary drafting tension, the wire being cooled by di rect contact with liquid coolant 38 as it leaves the sizing opening 36 and while it is wedged in the groove. In a multi stage apparatus, the coolant would be re moved from the wire downstream of the wheel and upstream of the next sizing opening e.g. by an air wipe 39 .
