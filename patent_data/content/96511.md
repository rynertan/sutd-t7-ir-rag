# Optical fibre termination method, terminal, splice, and connector therefor.

## Abstract
An optical fibre termination is provided by a short length of fibre 41 formed with coaxial metal coating and with optical end faces. One end 43 of the short coated length 41 is of reduced diameter to facilitate matching with a fibre 45 to be terminated to which the one end 43 is spliced. The splice comprises a resiliently deformable alignment body 49 having a fibre alignment passageway 50 and disposed between support bushings 44,51 having fibre passageways and encased within a crimping sleeve 48 . The coated fibre length 42 projects externally of the splice assembly and the fibre 45 to be terminated is abutted with the one end 43 of the coated length within the alignment passageway 50 . The crimping sleeve 48 is radially compressed to deform the alignment body 49 about the abutted ends to effect alignment, the support bushings 44,51 constraining the alignment body 49 against axial extrusion and being secured during the crimping process by indentation 60 . The projecting coated portion 42 may be releasably connected with a complimentary member in a resilient alignment in plug and socket manner.
