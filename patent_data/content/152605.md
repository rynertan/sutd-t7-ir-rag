# High repetition rate, uniform volume transverse electric discharger laser with pulse triggered multi arc channel switching.

## Abstract
A high power excimer laser 10 , suitable for annealing semiconductor wafers, emits a pulsed output at a high re petition rate in the ultraviolet wavelength region having a uniform power output across the laser beam 130 . A uniform discharge is caused beween anode 20 and cathode 22 in a first transverse gas flow passageway 18 automatically following a pulse applied to the preionisation electrodes 24 . The pulses are formed by a multichannel bar gap switch 28 in a second gas flow passageway 41 , which is connected to the first passageway 18 by a Blum lein network 30 .
