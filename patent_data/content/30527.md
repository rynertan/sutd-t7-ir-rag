An input selector of a fancy seam sewing maschine is provided with pattern selection means and an elec tronic seam memory for supplying stitch data to needle positioning and feeder mechanisms has within the pat tern selection means at least one switch 13, 14 related to the adjustment to a selected series of seams, e. g. utility seams, and a group of multi pole contacts 12 to these seams. The contacts give binary signals to the electronics of the machine and in illustrated embodiment with six double pole contacts a two of four code is achieved. Thanks to this, six wires which should be needed when using single pole contacts are reduced to four.
