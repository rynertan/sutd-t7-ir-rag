# Expandable fabric mold.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in forming fabric into a predeter mined threedimensional shape. The apparatus includes a contoured mold 10 having at least two parts 12, 14 which are movable between a retracted position and an expanded position. A fabric holding mechanism is provided for holding a fabric shell placed over the mold 10 in fixed position on the mold 10 when the mold parts 12, 14 are in expanded condition. A driving assembly is mounted on one of the mold parts and operatively associated with the other mold part for effecting relative expansion thereof.
