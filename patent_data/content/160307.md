## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS USEFUL INTHE TREATMENT OF RENAL DISEASES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure is known and has been amply demonstrated U.S. Patent 4,374,829 A. A. Patchett, et al., Nature, 288, 280 283 1980 D. M. Gross, et al., J. Pharm. andExpt. Ther., 216, 552 557 1981 . The use of suchACE inhibitors indicates the positive effects of control of Angiotensin II A II levels in a variety of renal disease states C. D. Smith, et al.,Arthritis and Rheumatism 1984 . It has been generally known for some time that a renal factor is involved in some forms of hypertension, but only relatively recently have some of the complex relationships in the renin angiotensin system been elucidated. In addition to its direct vasopressor effects and its control of adrenal secretion of afdosterone, A II has a direct effect on glomerular size and basement membrane porosity. D.P. Haley, et al., Abstract ofProceedings of Amer. Soc. of Nepth 15fA 1983 S.J. Hoorntje.l Heretofore, clinical studies have been directed to the blockade of the renin angiotensin system in the systemic circulation to control hypertension and congestive heart failure. Specific renin angiotensin systems have been observed to be present within the cells of specific organ systems such as, for example, the kidney, heart, brain, and blood vessels. f, R. Celio, et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci, USAt 78, 3897 1981 and Histochenaistry, 72, 1 1981 K. Naruse, et awl. have identified in rats the specific glomerular sites of A II production from angiotensin I A I and have demonstrated its subsequent blockage by the ACE inhibitor compound, enalapril. It has also been found that infusions of AII onto preparations of renal glomeruli produced shrinking of the glomerulus and smudging of the foot processes which is attendant with the development of proteinuria. S. J. Hoorntje, supra . Upon e imina tion of the infused A II, these acute, transitory changes disappear and proteinuria, glomerular volume, and foot processes configurations then return to normal. Although it has not yet been established, it appears that glomerular sclerosis plays a major role in progressive degradation of renal function regardless of the original etiology of the kidney disease. Clinically, it has been postulated that control of proteinuria in renal disease would result in controlling the underlying renal pathology. 1R. B. Miller, et al., Amer. J. Med., 46, 919 1969 . It has also been known that hypertension can produce renal disease and that renal disease can produce hypertension Renal and ElectrolyteDisorders, 282, Ed by R. W. Schrier 1976 .Although the control of hypertension through the use of ACE inhibitors has been established M. Burnier, et al., Amer. J. of Physiology, 245, 203 1983 H. R. Brunner, et al., Am. Int. Med., 90, 19 1979 1 it has yet to be determined that subsequent development of renal diseases will be ablated or even blunted by these agents. Diabetic nephropathy is also known to be associated with specific lesions in the kidney and eye, hypertension D. Myers, et al, Clin. Res., 27 316A, 1979 , and relative increases in circulating renin rw. A. Hsueh, et al, J. Coin. Endo.Metab., 51 535, 1980 . It has been postulated that the vascular lesions are related to the vasculotoxic effects of A II. Therefore, the inhibition of A II would be expected to have a positive effect on the course of the renal disease. It has been demonstrated that administration of the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, effectively blocks the pressor response to exogenous administered A I and significantly suppresses the activity of circulating converting enzyme for periods of up to about 24 hours. ID. M. Gross, et al., J. Pharm. andExpt. Ther., 216, 552 557 198l 1. Specific localization of enalapril in the kidney has been demonstrated as has its specific effect on the local production of A II within the glomerulus. As reported by D E. Hricik, et al. N.E. J. Med,, 308, 373 1983 , one might assume that in the A II dependent arterial stenotic kidney, renal insufficiency could occur upon administration of enalapril.However, it has been demonstrated that administration of enalapril in renin dependent states, such as renal vascular hypertension, results in virtual total control of blood pressure S.Franklin, Proceeding, Symposium RenovascularHypertension , Zurich 1984 1. SU9FARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that administration of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors alters renal hemodynamics in that ACE inhibitors have a positive effect on progressive renal failure. Representative of the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors that have been found to be useful in altering the progression of renal diseases by affecting intraglomerular hemodynamics and protein uria are such ACE inhibitors as carboxyalkyl dipeptide derivatives captopril fl 3 mercapto 2 methyl l oxopropyl L proline 2 1N S l ethoxy carbonyl 3 phenylpropyl 5 alanyl cis,endo 2 aza bicyclol3,3,0 octane 3 S carboxylic acid N S l ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl N 2 indanyl glycine l N S l ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl cis,syn octahydro H indole 2 S carboxylic acid 2 N S l ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropylj L alanyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroiso isoquinoline 3 S carboxylic acid and, l carboxymethyl 3 S l S ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropylamino 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH l benzazepine 2 one. In particular, the class of carboxyalkyl dipeptide derivatives which have been found to have this positive effect on progressive renal failure are those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,374,829, which also discloses methods for their preparation and which patent is incorporated herein by reference. Of the carboxyalkyl dipeptides disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,374,829, those of particular interest in this invention are N ll S ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenyl propylj L alanyl L proline, also known and referred to herein as enalapril N l S carboxy 3 phenyl propyl L alanyl L proline, also known and referred to herein as enalapril diacid and, Na l S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L lysyl L proline, also known and referred to herein as lisinapril. Thus, this invention is directed to the treatment of progressive renal failure which comprises administering to a person in need of such treatment a renal failure inhibiting amount of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compound which is a member selected from the group consisting of carboxyalkyl dipeptide derivatives l 3 mercapto 2 methyl l oxopropyl L proline 2 N S l ethoxy carbonyl 3 phenylpropyl S alanyli cis,endo 2 aza bicyclo 3,3,0 octane 3fS carboxylic acid N S l ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl N 2 indanyl glycine 1 N S 1 ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl cis,syn octahydro H indole 2 S carboxylic acid 2 N S 1 ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl l,2,3,4 tetrahydroiso isoquinoline 3 S carboxylic acid and, l carboxymethyl 3fS l S ethoxyearbonyl 3 phenylpropylamino 2,3,4,5 tetra hydro lHLli benzazepine 2 one. Preferably, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compound is a member selected from the group N 1 S ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl L proline N 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl L proline or, Na E 1 ss carboxy 3 phenylpropyll L lysyl L proline. Pursuant to this invention, administration of one of these renal failure inhibiting compounds results in altering the progression of renal disease by affecting the intraglomerular hemodynamics and proteinuria i.e., by affecting the blood pressure within the functioning, filtering tissue of the kidney and the quantity of albumin in the urine. For use in treating progressive renal failure, an ACE inhibitor compound can be administered orally, transdermally, or parenterally i.e., intravenously, interperitoneally, etc. and in any suitable dosage form. Thus, the compounds may be offered in a form a for oral administration e.g., as tablets, in combination with other compounding ingredients customarily used such as talc, vegetable oils, polyols, benzyl alcohols, gums, gelatin, starches and other carriers dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in a suitable liquid carrier in capsules or encapsulated in a suitable encapsulating material or b for parenteral administration e.g., dissolved or dispersed in a suitable liquid carrier or emulsified. The ratio of active compound to compounding ingredients i.e., carrier, diluent, etc., will vary as the dosage form requires. Whatever dosage form is used, the amount of compound administered should be sufficient to effect a blood pressure control, b reduce protein uria and c reduce glomerular lesions. Generally, doses of the compounds of the invention can be administered in amounts of from about 0.1 mg to about 1 g and preferably from about 5 to about 500 mg per day. Dosage may be single or multiple depending on the daily total required and the unit dosage.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following example sets forth the best mode currently known for practicing the invention and is intended to be illustrative and not limitative of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Augmented glomerular capillary pressure PGC and flow QA are associated with progressive glomerular injury in rats with reduced nephron number i.e., the number of functioning units within the kidney. The role of these hemodynamic changes in remnant renal injury was evaluated by comparing male Munich Wistar rats subjected to 85 oblation of renal mass i.e., surgical removal of 85 of the kidney, and given either no treatment C or a compound of the invention i.e., enalapril E .Results obtained after 4 weeks showed that E controlled systemic blood pressure awake systolic pressure SBP and mean arterial pressure under anesthia AP 0 and nearly normalized PGC while the supranormal single nephron glomerular filtration rate SNGFR and flow QA seen in remnant kidneys of rats given no treatment C were only modestly reduced. These results are set forth in Table I below wherein values are given as 1 SE i.e., standard error, and wherein n denotes the number of animals rats tested ml m denotes milliliters per minute nl m denotes nanoliters per minute mg d denotes milligrams per day and, GFR denotes glomerular filtration rate. GFR SNGFR QA Test Rats SBP AP PGC ml m nl m nan C n 6 169 8 145 6 68 2 0.92 0.05 102 8 374 28E n 6 115 5 102 2 54 2 0.85 0.05 84 9 312 41 p 0.01 E vs. C After 8 9 weeks, similarly prepared C rats no treatment exhibited continued hypertension SBP, 179 10 AP, 141 6 mmHg , developed proteinuria 70 10 mg d and extensive glomerular lesions epithelial cell bleb, droplet formation and, segmental sclerosis whereas E treated rats treated with enalapril exhibited continued blood pressure control SBP, 125 3 AP, 102 3 mmHg , developed significantly less proteinuria 18 2 mg d , and markedly fewer glomerular lesions. The foregoing results indicate that control of glomerular hypertension by use of the ACE inhibitor compounds of the invention effectively limits glomerular injury in rats having renal ablation and that as a result of these glomerular hemodynamic changes, progressive renal injury is mediated when nephron number is reduced. It also appears from the foregoing that a decrease in transmembrane selective permeability ICf or LpA not only contributes to proteinuria, but also alters the passage of proteins into the mesangial cells with subsequent glomerular sclerosis. EXAMPLE 2 Male Munich Wister rats were studied 4 6 weeks after being injected with streptozotocin 60 mg kg . The blood glucose BG level of the rats was maintained between 200 400 mg d by daily injections of ultralente insulin. The rats were divided into two groups, one group receiving an additional treatment group DM and the other group receiving 15 mg l of enalapril E in their drinking water group DMX . Another group of age matched normal rats were evaluated as the control group group C . The results of these studies are set forth in Table II below wherein the results are given as 1 SE and wherein MAP denotes mean arterial pressure WE denotes kidney weight and AP denotes the difference in pressure measured across the glomerular membrane. TABLE II Test Rats BG MAP 1W SNGFR 0A Group mg d mm Ho g nl m nl m mm Hg c n 7 87 3 118 3 1.1 0.1 46 4 154 38 39 1 DM nn8 3S0 11 115 4 1.5 0.1 82 6 269 26 52 2 DMX n 8 346 14 98 4 1.3 0.1 72 7 227 14 37 1 p 0,05 vs. C p 0.05 vs. DM The results shown in Table II above reveal that the DM group of rats had marked elevations in kidney weight KW , single nephron glomerular filtration rate SNGFR , augmented glomerular capillary flow QA , and glomerular membrane pressure P . Despite similar increases in BG levels, the DMX group of rats exhibited normalization of AP as well as lesser elevations in SNGFR and primarily as a result of lower MAP. Additional rats divided into the same types of groups, i.e., groups C, DM and DMX, were maintained under similar conditions for a period of 6 8 months. Albuminurea mg 24 h for these groups of rats were found to be as follows Group C 3 1 Group DM 32 8 Group DMX 4 1 p 0.05 DM vs. C p 4 0.05 DMX vs. DM . These results establish that intraglomerular hypertension and progressive proteinuria can be readily reversed in the initiation of diabetic glomerular disease by treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compound of the invention.
