# Air ionizer for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An air ionizer 14 for installation in the air intake path of an internal combustion engine, to introduce ozone and other oxidizing agents into the engine with acceptable levels of air flow restriction and at a sufficient concentration level to substantially improve combustion within the engine. A glass tube 15 is filled with an inert gas 23 and has an inner electrode 22 extending a short distance into an end of the tube. A foraminous copper outer electrode 17 substantially surrounds the glass tube and is slightly spaced apart from it. A high voltage is applied between the inner and outer electrodes 17, 22 , so that when air flows past the tube 15 , ozone and other oxidizing agents are generated between the outer surface of the tube 15 and the outer electrode 17 , and escape into the air stream through the holes 26 in the outer electrode.
