## Description
INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING THE SPEED AND FUEL CONSUMPTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES The invention relates to an instrument for measuring the speed and fuel consumption of motor vehicles, provided with a speedometer actusted with coil spring of logarithmic characteristie curve and logarithmically graduated speedometer scale. furthermore it has a device measuring the vow sumed fuel in its through floe, the amount of which is shown by the logarithmically graduated scale moving along the speedometer scale. The two scales moving along each other Jointly show the index numbers of the speed and fuel consumption. while the travelling speed of the vehicle is indicated by the speed pointer of the speedo motor moving over the figures, at the sale time showing also the index numbers of the fuel con gumption corresponding to the indicated speed index numbers e.g. km hour and thus with the aid of the logarithmic acale the instrument funo toning as a slide rule continuously evaluates and shows thb variations of the interdependent data of speed and consumption.The inatrument has adjustment facilities Se.g. specific weight of fuel increasing the functional and measuring accuraoy, furthermore it has an indicator device related to the consumption. The economical operation of the internal combuation engine and motor vehicles is based on the economic fuel consumption measurement and control. The easurement shall be such as to enable the driver of the motor vehicle to operate the vehicle economically according to the existing load and road conditions. No suitable instrument has existed for this purpose so far, akthough the internal combustion engines and motor vesicles have been known for about a century. Under the present conditions the factories or workshops carrying out general over haul, check the motors with test and take up a g hour lip diasram from the consumption varying according to the load and speed. which are pre pared moatly for the max. load, but still under idealized conditions, thus serving only the infor matoxy or meaourenent control purpose of the specialists. These are useless for the operators of the motors and for drivers of the motor vehicles. Further drasback for the operators is that certain manufacturers in order to promote the business interests put the motor vehicles and motor on the market set to a supercharged parfor mance, whereby they can promote and introduce vehicles with higher speed, acceleration and with more favourable properties against the competion, which however represent about 20 excess oon sumption. In the course of running, the instruments known and available so far generally being of measuring system are suitable only for measur ing the amount of fuel calculated to volume or weight consumed on a distance of definite length e.g. 10 or 100 km, or within t unit of time, e.g.per hour. Furthermore such electrical fuel gauge is also known, hicil connected before the cat buretter or injector of the motor, indicates the amount of fuel on its counter and shows the fuel consumption of the motor in time or during the distance tavelled by the vehicle by summing up on the counter roll, or recording on a diagram tape.Due to its simple measurement and minor in mocuracy, thiB latter one is more favourable at the instruments with measuring tand aystem, but none of the mentioned instruments le suitable for realizing the objective of the invention, In lask of instr ment, only the average consumption can be aeasared ith the kilometre counter, or with the known instruments, wsich due to the many influencing circumatancoa, such as driving in city, on highway, flat or mountansus road conditions, quality of driving, frequent starting, stopping, idle running, slow speed.high speed, etc. give not even approximately realistic value. Driving of the motor vehicles at low or high speed may result in excess consumption even at identical road conditions and distance, while there is an optimal speed varying according to the vehicle type and the individual driver at which the fuel consumption of the vehicle is the ioat favourable. The instrament according to the invention is suitable for thie purpose and by its use the driver is capable to run its vehicle at the optimally economic fuel consumption. The instrument according to the invention is realized with tte conibined operation of two instrument units assentially of novel solution by themselves in which one unit measures the vehicle speed With a coil spring of logarithmio characteristic curve ard shows the speed of the vehicle on a logarithmically graduated scale, while the other inetrument unit measures the amount of consumed fuel showing it on a logarithmically graduated scale fitted onto a rotary disc.The logarithmically graduated dise showning the amount of fuel moves or turns along a soale showing the speed values with reciprocal loga rithmic scale division and the kilometre counter turning over the two scale divisions will show the travelling speed of the vehicle together with the consumed amount of fuel corresponding to the speed. The initial measuring position of the gra duated rotary disc showing the amount of fuel is adjustable with correction according to the spe cifto weight of tire fuel to be used. Between the eel of kilometre counter and rotary disc of the fuel gauge a rolling wheel ec, tusted with circulating motion is used as a differential wheel, which by ite prograss or backward rolling according to the rotary speed difference of the two discs switches on the circuit of on incandescent lamp of varying colour and shows the excess speed or under consumption, or in bet ween the correct speed pertinent to the optimal consumption. Further reducthon of the speed and increase of the consumption are indicated by lamp of different colour The disc showing the consumed amount of fuel is conoentrio with the pointer of the speedometer and since the consumtion is caloulated in litre km, reciprocal scale is used. This way the pointer of the instrument showe not only the speed of the vehicle, but also the existing consumption for 100 km, on the rotary disc measuring the recipro cal conssuition. The consumption per hour can also be rod off under the 100 km mark on the instru next. The accuracy is increased by the initial correction of the scale measuring the consumption, whereby at stationary motor when the fuel is filled in, the scale division is set to the spe oifie weight value with the aid of an externally controlled adjusting button. Values of the spe oifie weight are shown on the pushbutton, which can be set to litre, or kp at will. In the embodiment of the example both scales of the instrument are logarithmically graduated to 100, thus the speedometer will easure socurately up to 200 km. In ordcr to t e e larage scale because of the 1200 measurement the speed measure ment starte with 5 km h, since the measurement of lower speed is not necessary. The upper limit of the fuel gauge as taken to 100 I h in order to moot the consumption that inay occur in practice, furthermore because of the 120 measurement limit, the swing was reduced to 40 l h.Maturally in addition to the solution of the example the measuring limits an be extended as desired, and the accurate reading of the scale can also be inorsased for instance with a suitablly used magmifier. In order that the driver should be able to observ the operation of the instrument without affecting the driving and deviating the attention, a light signal automaton is built into the ins trument. This functions in such a way that when the speed of the vehicle is above the optimal consusption, then the internal or external leap of the instrument will emit green light. When the optimal or lowest consumption for 100 km is rasched, its colour signal will change over to white. In excess of this the red lamp lights up. A lamp will be alight showing always only a single colour. this automatic switch however ean be uod not only in tnis instrument, but due to its functional capacity of indicating the optimal positions of function with two or more variables, it has extremely wide field of wtilisation, e,g.in the field of automation. Actuator of the light signal lamps is such a current switch, which electrically switches the relative speed variation of the two independent rotary discs. The two discs eay sabatitute the two coordinates of the diaru all this a change of turn occurs at the extreme values of the disgram, which is indicated by the lew resistant rolling, friction bevel wheel via turn of switch. This may the instrument serves as a guide tor the driver to adjust the speed and oonstion ecanomically without reading the numerical consamption. By converaion of the logarithnie coil spring ala forming a suitable scale, the Instrument ean be converted from the CGS unit system to the seale of another unit system. The speedometer ean be easily adjusted and the mile gallan consumption scale besides the scale variation can be sabstituted with non reciprocal scale. The instrument according to the invention Is described in detail by way of example with reference to the enclosed drawinge, as followstFigure 1 section of the instrnment housing along its centreline, arrangement of te structural parts, and partly its scctional visw,Figure 2 detail showing theFigure 3s plan view of the graduated disco of the measuring devices from the direction of the removed cover of the instrument housing,Figure 4 Bection of the scale adjnsting dovice,Figure 5 and,6s section and side view of the jcumalling bedding of the instrument s rotary discs Figures 7,8,9, and 10 enlarged view of part A shown in Fig.l., the sectional wiew is shown in Fig. , side view from the right in Fig.8., partly view and partly sec tion from the leftin Fig.9., and plan view In Pig. 10. The instrument can be produced with use of the kilometre counter speedometer 1 need in the or vehicles, which is driven from the gear box through the driving shaft la of the speedometer, at which a coil spring 2 unctioning according to logarithmic characteristic curve is used in place of spring giving the restoring torgue of the flexible shaft sonsacted with the speedometar pointer Fig.l. . The spring 2 with atams 2a of the annular oasing is placed into the Vahaped trough 4 fixed with screw 4 Fig.2. .The coil spring can be calibrated even in the assembled condition of the instrument by varying the che rasteristio cnrve with screw 5, which is adjuetable from the outside with the screwdriver through tube 5a Fig.3. .This way the speedemeter can be calibrated subsequently even if its mugaetio force should weaken during the us age, which at the present can be reoaired only by remagnetization or replacement of the speedameter spring. Gear 6a is fitted to the shaft 6.of the kilometer counter in place of the pointer, the toot number and circle of engagement can be calculated according to the geer ratio of the counter. The other important part is the instrument 7 messuring the varying amount of the fuel. A blade is turned at 1200 with the pressure brought about by reducing two flew aross section of the fuel conducted in throu pipe 7a and foraarded through pipe 7b conscot to the instrument.The blade turns in proportien with the flow rate of the fuel, the poinven of which is replaced by a rotary diso 8 with gsar 9, ergaged with gear 10 at a ratio of 9 1 Figures 3 and 4 . Rotary dise 9 has a logarithuleslly gradusted seale, which in accowdance with the specific weight of the fuel aceurately shows the fuel consumption in litre or kp units of moasure according to the adjustment tranamftted by turn of gea 10. The gear 10 is mounted on the squerewahaped pin 11. onto which tno driving ring 12 is fixed with bolt 13. Pin 11 is rotatably fixed in the hole through d sc 8. fae 11d steel magnet block 14 is fixed on gear 9, on thich the instrument 7 measuring the amount of fuel turnes the gear 9 with the magnetic line of force. Gears 9 and 10 are surrounded from above by flanged disc 15 with the scale disc 5, dise 15 is fixed to the scale disc with rivets 16 in such a way that the surrounded gears 9 and 10 should remain rotatable Fig.4. . Dise 8 in this assenbled condition is to be statically balanced.Fisc 8 with the tapered shaft 17 is embedded joernalled in the conical bearing housings 18 and 19, which with the upper bearing 20 are hold tagether by lugs 21, or by a flexible, so called snep fastener coupling Figures 5 and 6 .In the latter bearing housing the kilometre whsel 22 is carried with its tapered pin 22a. The beerings snpperted parts turn at 120 . Which is made possibleas the path of motion of lugs 21 by the oirouler openings 22b in gear disc 22 and by the similar openings in gear disc 9. The gear 22 of the Loietse pointer embedded in bearings 19 and 20 rotates coaxially and independently from disc 8 with alight friction around its pointed ahaft 22. Pointer 23 is fixed to gear 22.The gear 6a of the kilometre counter ia connected through gear 4 with the gear 22 of identical Sise, which gear 24 rotates with its tapered pin in bearing 25, which is fixed to plate 27 with serew 26 allowing the adjustment of the gears in relation to esch other Fig.2. . plate 27 is provided th an opening to receive the instrument 7 showing the varying anomnt of fuel, and embracing fork like erms, and the plate is fastened to the holder formed oa the speedometer 1, whereby the two instruments are in a fixed position in relation to sach other. In addition, the instrumente 1 and 7 are fixed with screws to the bottom of the instrument housing 28. Furthermore the lamp socket 29 is also fastened to the bottom of instrument housing 28, in which socket three incandescent lamps of different colours, e.g. red white green are emplaced. The cables of the incandescent lps passing below plate 27 are connected with z thres way switch 30 in which the wires are soldered to the horizontal 30a and 30b and to the rectangular lower contact outlet terminals 30a of the insulated ring distributor Figures 8 8 and 9 .The switch 30 with the insulated ring diatributor is mounted on the rectangular plate 31, onto which the plate 31a is riveted and pin 32 is embedded in the holes. The plate brush 33 is arranged in the split shaft end of pin 32, and a friction hevel whees 34 is rotatab ly momnted between the two bearing supported parts ot the shaft, the end side of its thicker part rubbing to disc 35, which is tightly fitted or wedged on pin 32. Stop pin 36 is fixed in die 35, ii order to prevent the turn of shaft 32 in excess of 1860 by impact upon the plate end walls 31b extending as the end part of the semi circularly machined part around the bearing hole of plato 31a Fig.8 . The rectangular plate 31 is fixed with serews to the gear 22. to the so called kilometre wheel, in which is to be statically balanced in its eondition equipped with the switch and pointer 23. The friction bevel wheal 34 rolls on the sloping surface of the hub part of the large gear 9 on disc 8. In case of difference in the relative forward or backward motion of the diec 8t and pointer carrying kilometre wheel 22 due to deviation of the rotation velocities then the friction bevel wheel 34 rotates and with its pressure friction axially acting on the dise 35, turns the shaft 32.The atop pin fitted disc 35 rotates with the shaft into one of the extreme rotary positions limiting the machined part of plate 31a with the extensions 31b on both sides, when the plate brush 33 co rotating with the shaft switches on the circuit of one of the two extreme, e.g. green or red incandescent lamps.In case of co rotatin of the scale disc 8 and kilometre wheel 22, as well as at movement change the friction bevel wheels stops. disc 36 with stop pin 36 remnins in the position between stops31b and limits the turn and in this cane contact 30. of the circuit wire of tie white bulb in the middle of plate brush 33 is switched on posetion according to Fig.7. . The negative branch of the circuit is formed by ttle instrumant or motor bay. The logerithmie scale 28a of 120 are langth showing the speed, graduated between the 5 200 km h limits is mounted and fixed to the instrument housing 28. The pointer 23 does not indicate the travelling speed below 5 km h. because the luge 21 extending into the openings 22b fron the bearing of the kilometre wheel 22 carrying the pointer limit the rotation of the whsel, prevent the rotation below and in excess of the scale, and thus the turn together with the pointer 23 can begin only at speed higher than The knob 38 setting the specific weight of the fuel is mounted on the plate 37 covering the whole instrument, and it is out out only along the aro length of the scale, each half of the circumference of the edge is provided with scale divisions showing the values of specifie weight between 0.6 1.0 limits in litre and kp Figures 3 and 4. . The sca e division on knob 38 is set over the division and with arrow on plate 37 to the value of the fuel specific weight acquired at the petrol station in stationary state of the aotor.The specific weight is set by turn of the knob 38 while being pressed. The gear 10 setting the spe attic weight by its turn, together with the dwiv inc ring 12 fixed on th6 square pin ll rotates with dise 6 during run of the aotor and progress of the vehicle, but trie knob 38 returns to its initial position coinciding with the axis of ro tation in stationary position of the motor.Knob 38 with shaft 39 is embedded in plate 37 and by pressing it down against the supporting spring 40, the hollow head 39s fitted to the shaft end 39 can be pushed onto the driving ring 1 and knob 38 with its turn according to the seale division corresponding to the specifie weight et the fuel rotates the gear 10, which through the gear 9 sets the logerithmically graduated disc 8 according to the specific weight. During travel the turn of goar 10 and driving ing 12 ae well as maladjustment of disc 8 are prevented by the adhesion of the large bearing surface bet ween the large gear 1 and disc. Knob 38 is secured in its position by spring 40 pulling it into its tapered housing. Besides the above described scale adjusting device according to the specific weight of the fuel, a thermostat is used in the instrument unit 7 measuring the flow rate of the fuel, which senses the temperature and viscosity of the fuel conducted into pipe 7a and through 7b.This thermostat per foris as automatic adjustment following the tem perature and viscosity variation of thd fuel in such a way that the spring of the thermostat varisa the flow cross section along the blade rotated by the pressure of the fuel flow, with the aid Or a control plate. Consequently the blade and with it the logarithmically graduated seale disc 8 will tZ in proportion with the amount of fuel flowing through the opening controlled according to the temperature and viscosity variations. The structural parts of the instrument, except for the mild steel magnet 14, shall be produced with the use of coloured and non magnetizable m terials. The scale divisions and signal lamps 42 are Nisible through the window 41 in cover plate 37. The instrament inalnding its desoribed structural parts forts a twit arranged in the instrument housing 28. thich can be mounted into the instrument board in place of the kilometre indicators used in the motor vehicles. Besides the speedometer the kilometre counter too can be arranged in the instrument housing and the kilometre counter too can be operated from its driving shaft, for the rading of which a window is formed on the cover of the instrument housing. The existing and known auitable Odometing kilometre counter combined spesdoreter can also be used for the instrument in such a way that an adjustable coil spring sith variable tansioning and charac teristic curve functioning sccording to logerith mie characteristic curve being a novel solution in itself is used as the restoring devioe of the speedouster pointer. The instrument according to the invention is suitable for reducing the well known air pollute ing effect of motor vehicles. The regulations con corning the reduction of air pollution require very complicatod, expensive messuring instruments, and because of tills, for the time being they can be checked Senerally and practically only in the manufacturing werde under laboratory conditions, at the Ejame time the operators. and drivers of the motor vehicles do not know the extent of air pollution caused by the motor ve hides used by them.The amount of poisonous haust gaees of carbonronoxide and hydrocarbon content due to overfeeding of the fuels can be reduced by adjusting with the instrument the acomemical fuel oonsumption most auftmble for the operating conditions of the motor vehicles. Usefulness of the instrumant in respect of the general economy is increased by the econemis reasons arising from the countingal rise of the fuel price. Considerable reduction of the eoanemi and controlled fuel consumption can be ttaned by the accurate adjustment of the car buretters, which are easily ohecked with the instrument, Consumption of the motors at idle run can also be checked if the instrument to be read off the scale showing the amount of litre hour. By. indicating the excess fuel consumption, the instrument calls the attention of the driver to unnoticed faults auch as pulled in handbrake, fuel leakage, ignition failure onto, moreover to other disorders as malfunction of valves. burning, cssemtion of cooling water circulation due to broken Vbe1I etc.
