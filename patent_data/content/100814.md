# Method and apparatus for measuring total corrosion rate.

## Abstract
The corrosion of galvanically coupled metals can be measured and monitored by linear polarization techniques using a test galvanic electrode comprising two individual electrodes of different metals preferably connected end to end with a rigid metallic fastener The galvanic electrode is treated as a single electrode and can be used as the test electrode in any two or three electrode configuration which includes at least the test electrooe and a reference electrode. A three electrode configuration, including also an auxiliary electrode, is adapted for use in combination with the PAIR meter.
