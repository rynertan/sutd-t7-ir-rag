# CATHODE RAY TUBE DISPLAY SYSTEM AND METHOD HAVING BIDIRECTIONAL LINE SCANNING

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube display system and method having bidirectional line scanning are disclosed. Bidirectional line scanning is achieved by scanning each odd numbered scan line from left to right and each even numbered scan line from right to left, thereby avoiding the necessity for retrace, or flyback. In order to avoid loss of intelligibility in displaying the video information received from a conventional source providing video information written only from left to right, as is conventional, the received video information is stored in memory by scan lines with each odd numbered line being read out in the same order as stored in memory and each even numbered line being read out in reverse order as stored in memory. Timed control is provided for processing of the video information and display thereof with bidirectional scanning, and geometric error correction is provided for both the horizontal and vertical scan generators.
