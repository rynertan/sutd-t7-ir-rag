# Power transmission for four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
A power transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in cludes a change speed gearing 14 mounted within a trans mission casing 11 , and an intermediate differential unit 16 assembled within the transmission casing and drivingly con nected to an output shaft of the change speed gearing to be ap plied with a driving torque through the change speed gearing for transmitting the driving torque to a first drive shaft 30 for front wheel drive and to a second drive shaft 18 for rear wheel drive. The differential unit comprises an input member 50 drivingly connected to the output shaft of the change speed gearing 14 , a plurality of planetary gear sets A₁, B₁, C₁ coaxially arranged within the transmission casing and driv ingly connected to the input member, the planetary gear sets being designed to provide a plurality of drive power trains at a different gear ratio, and a shift mechanism D arranged to selectively connect one of the planetary gear sets to the first and second drive shafts.
