## Abstract
Disclosed is an interleaved multiple signal separating circuit in which a luminance signal and a chrominance signal are separated by a circuit for adding a composite video input signal including the luminance signal and chrominance signal which is delayed by a predetermined period of time by an ultrasonic solid delay line to the composite video input signal and by a circuit for subtrating the delayed composite video input signal from the composite video input signal. The separating circuit comprises a series circuit of an input trans ducer of the ultrasonic solid delay line and a voltage division load connected to the input transducer. The input signal is applied to the series circuit. A delay output signal from the output transducer of the ultrasonic solid delay line and a signal across the voltage division load are combined to pro vide a sum signal and a difference signal thereof.
