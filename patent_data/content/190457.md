## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to derivatives of 3methyl imidazo f4,5 c 7 pyrazole having therapeutical activity. Furthermore, this invention relates also to a process for the preparation of said derivatives.More particularly, the derivatives of this invention corres pond to the following structural formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is a C1 C4 alkyl group, preferably a methyl group, or aEMI1.2 group in which Hal represents a halogen, preferably C1 or F, and R is a C1 C4 alkyl group, preferably a methyl group, or a phenyl group. The compounds of formula I of the present invention are endowed with an intense depressant activity on the central nervous system, in particular they exhibit the following activities anticonvulsant, sedative, analgesic and hypothermizing. These activities occur at doses a lower than the toxic ones. In particular, the acute toxicityLD50 per os in the mouse js of 150 mg kg. Few bibliographic references to the nucleus of imidazo 4,5 cj pyrazole are found up to a few years ago, the only two known representative compounds were l phenyl 5 hydroxy imidazo L fr4,5 e 7 pyrazole v.A.Dornow, E.Hinz,Chem.Ber.91,1834 1958 and l phenyl 3 methyl 5 mercap tomidazole L4,5 cJ7 pyrazole v.I. Grandberg, G.V. Klyuchko,Zh. Obshch. Khim. 32, 1898 1962 . More recently, two research groups attain the synthesis of other members, the pharmacology of which had not, however, been investigated at all. v.M. Lange,R.QuelI, H. Lettau,H.Schubert,Z.Chem. 17,94 1977 V.Sudarsanam, K.Nagarajan,K.Rama Rao, S.J.Shenoy, Tetrahedron Letters 21, 4757 1980 K.Nagarajan, V.Sudarsanam,S.J. Shenoy, K.Rama Rao, Indian J.Chem. Sect. B 21B, 997 1982 . The above mentioned members were obtained a byCurtius transposition and cyclization of 4 carbazolyl 5aminopyrazoles, b by cyclizationof 4 nitro 5 benzylaminopyrazoles, c by reaction of 4,5 diaminopyrazoles with carbon sulphide and d by cycloaddition of diazomethane on the double bond C C of 5 nitroimidazoles. It has now been found that acylation of 5 aminopyrazoles of formula II v.Scheme A with benzoyl chloride or acetic anhydride leads to the corresponding 5 acylaminopyrazoles of formula III which are reduced to 5 alkylaminopyrazoles of formula IV by means of LiAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran.Nitrosation with amyl nitrite and hydrochloric acid leads to the 4 nitroso 5 alkylaminopyrazoles of formula V , which are cyclized to imidazo J4,5 cJ pyrazoles of formula I , by ref fluxing in pyridine. According to the process of this ivention, the above mentioned compounds are obtained in good yields as crystalline products, except the 5 alkylaminopyrazoles of formula IV which generally occur as oils. In certain cases, the compounds of formula I crystallize with water molecules, however, thenonhydrated product can easily be obtained by heating at reduced pressure, over P205, over a period of 48 hours. The spectral IR and 1H NMR data of the compounds of formula I are consistent with the structures as reported.SCHEMA AEMI3.1 reflux in pyridine see the preceeding page EMI4.1 I V a b c d e 9 g h i R CH3 CH3 C6H5 C6H5 p.ClC6H4 p.ClC6H4 m.ClC6H4 m.ClC6H4 o.ClC6H4R CH3 C6H5 CH3 C6H5 CH3 C6H5 CH3 C6H5 CH3 I V l m n o p q rR o.ClC6H4 p.FC6H4 p.FC6H4 m.FC6H4 m.CF6H4 o.CF6H4 o.CF6H4R C6H5 CH3 C6H5 CH3 C6H5 CH3 C6H5 Example 1 1,3 dimethyl 5 phenylimidazo 4,5 pyrazole I b A suspension of 1,3 dimethyl 5 aminopyrazole IIb 4.445g, 0.04 mole and benzoyl chloride 0.23ml, 0.02 mole ih anhydrous benzene is refluxed for one hour and then filtered, upon evaporation of the solvent, a solid is obtained, corresponding to 1,3 dimethyl 5 benzamidopyrazole III b , which is purified by crystallization from ethyl acetate petroleum ether 3,26g, yield 76t, m.p. 1350 1360C . 3.26g of 1,3 dimethyl 5 benzamidopyrazole III b 0.015 mole , dissolved into anhydrous tetrahydrofuran 19my , are added to a suspension of LiAlH4 1.13g,0.030 mole in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran 11 ml under a nitrogen stream.
