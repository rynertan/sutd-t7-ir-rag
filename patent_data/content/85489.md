# Improved storage logic array circuit.

## Abstract
An improved storage logic array 200 of compact and simplified construction has its storage cells 202 comprising pairs of oppositely directed inverters 204, 206 . These, in addition to being more compact in themselves, each require only two leads 224, 226 , instead of four needed by conventional flip flops. The inverters may each comprise a depletion type MOS transistor 208, 216 in series with an enhancement type MOS transistor 210, 220 .
