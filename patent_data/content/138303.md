## Description
NAPHTHALENE SULPHONIC ACIDS This invention relates to naphthalene sulphonic acids especially ureido naphthol sulphonic acids which are useful as coupling components in the manufacture of azo dyestuffs. It is well known to use aiiinonaphthol sulphonic acids as coupling components in the manufacture of azo dyestuffs. Also it is well known to use as coupling components derivatives of these compounds in which the amino group is converted to an amido group e.g. an acetylamino or benzoylamino group. We have now found a novel class of naphthol sulphonic acids which when used as coupling components lead to azo dyes, especially reactive dyes, with desirable properties such as high solubility combined with strong colouring power for textile substrates. According to the present invention there are provided naphthol sulphonic acids of the formula EMI1.1 where n is 1 or 2 R is H or an optionally substituted alkyl R1 is H, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted cycloalkyl, or R and R1 together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic ring. Preferred naphthol sulphonic acids have n as 2 and especially are of the formula EMI2.1 where one of yl and Y is SO3H and the other H. Especially preferred naphthol sulphonic acids are of the formula EMI2.2 As examples of alkyl groups represented by R and R1 there may be mentioned C18 especially C14 alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl and octyl and these groups with substituents particularly two and especially one such as OH, CN, OS03H, S03H, amino, mono or di Cl 4 alkylamino, aminoalkylamino, C14 alkoxy or hydroxy C1 4 alkoxy, for example hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, cyanoethyl, sulphatoethyl, sulphoethyl, aminobutyl, N methylaminopropyl, N, N dimethylaminopropyl, N aminoethylaminoethyl, methoxyethyl, hydroxyethoxyethyl and hydroxypropoxypropyl. As examples of cycloalkyl groups represented by R1 there may be mentioned cyclohexyl and methylcyclohexyl. When R and K1 together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic ring this ring may optionally contain further hetero atoms in addition to the nitrogen shown in formula 1 . Examples of such heterocyclic rings includeEMI3.1 The preferred naphthol sulphonio acids are those of formula 3 in which R and R1 are each independently selected from H and C14 alkyl, optionally substituted with OH, CN, mono or di C 1 4 alkylamino or hydroxy C 1 4 alkoxy or R and R1 together are CH2 4 or 5 CH2 20 CH2 2, CH2 2NH CH2 2 or R is cyclohexyl. It will be appreciated that the naphthol sulphonic acids shown herein in the free acid form may be readily converted to salts e.g.ammonium, sodium or potassium and will be conveniently handled in such a form especially in aqueous solutions. The naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 may be manufactured by a number of processes depending to some extent on the nature of R and R1 . The naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 in which R and R are both H may be obtained by reacting aminonaphthol sulphonic acids of the formula EMI4.1 where n is 1 or 2 with metal cyanates e.g. sodium cyanate under acid conditions. The reaction is conducted in aqueous media at 0 250C. The product is not usually isolated but used in solution for coupling rFeactions. On heating, the naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 with R R H convert to cyclic urethanes of the formula EMI4.2 which may be alternatively obtained by reacting the aminonaphthol sulphonic acid of formula 4 with phosgene. As examples of aminonaphthol sulphonic acids of formula 4 there may be mentioned S , K and especially H acids. A wide variety of naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 may be obtained by reacting the cyclic urethanes of formula 5 with an amine of the formula H.NRR1. This reaction may be carried out in alcoholic media especially methanolic media at ambient temperature or with slight heating e.g. at temperatures of 40 80 C. The reaction may also be conducted in aqueous media but this often leads to a minor proportion of unwanted products e.g. aminonaphthol sulphonic acid of formula 4 . The reaction mixture is usually used for further reaction e.g. couplings without purification though product may be isolated if desired by conventional means. As examples of amines of the formula H.NRR1 there may be mentioned ammonia, methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, butylamine, methylhexylamine, beta cyanoethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, taurine, N,N dimethylaminopropylamine, N methylethanolamine, cyclohexylamine, morpholine, piperidine, piperazine and pyrrolidine. Some naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 in which R1 is optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted cycloalkyl may be obtained by reacting an aminonaphthol sulphonic acid of formula 4 with an isocyanate of the formula RÚ.NCO where RÚ is optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted cycloalkyl. This reaction may be carried out in aqueous medium at essentially neutral pH and ambient temperatures. There may be some concomitant formation of a urethane by reaction of the OH group in the aminonaphthol sulphonic acid in addition to reaction at the amino group but this unwanted urethane group may be removed by hydrolysis e.g. by increasing the pH of the reaction mixture for a short time. It will be appreciated that this method is applicable only to products of formula 1 in which R is H and in which R1 does not bear isocyanate reactive substituents such as OH. As examples of isocyanates R1.NCO for use in this process there may be mentioned methyl isocyanate, propyl isocyanate and hexyl isocyanate. As with the previous methods of manufacturing the naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 the product may be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods or used with isolation in further reactions such as coupling. The naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 1 are valuable chemical intermediates especially for use as coupling components in the manufacture of azo dyestuffs. Thus a further feature of the present invention is azo dyestuffs of the formula EMI6.1 where A or its precursor is the radical of a diazotisable amine and n, R and R1 have the meanings given above. In many instances the radical A will correspond directly with the radical of the diazotisable amine used to prepare the dyestuff.This preparation will be by conventional means i.e. the amine A.NH2 will be diazotised e.g. by reaction with sodium nitrite acid at OOC and the resulting diazonium salt solution added to a solution of the naphthol sulphonic acid of formula 1 at O to 300C. The amine A. NH2 may itself contain one or more azo groups leading to the formation of a dis or polyazo dye of formula 6 . As specific examples of amines A.NH2 there may be mentioned aniline 2,3 and 4 sulphonic acids aniline 2,5 disulphonic acid aniline 3 ,5 disulphonic acid aniline 2 , 4 disulphonic acid 4 and 5 sulphoanthranilic acids 2 nitroaniline 4 sulphonic acid 4 nitroaniline 2 sulphonic acid 3 nitroaniline 6 sulphonic acid 5 nitro 2 aminoanisole 4 sulphonic acid 2 methylaniline 4,5 disulphonic acid 2,5 dichloroaniline 4 sulphonic acid 4 methylaniline 2 sulphonic acid 5 chloro 4 methylaniline 2 sulphonic acid 4 methoxyaniline 2 sulphonic acid 4 chloroaniline 3 sulphonic acid 5 acetylaminoaniline 2,4 disulphonic acid anthranilic acid 2 aminoterephthalic acid m aminobenzoic acid 3 or 4 aminophthalic acids p aminobenzoic acid 5 nitroanthranilic acid 6 nitro 3 aminobenzoic acid 5 nitro 2 aminoterephthalic acid RTI ID 7.2 l naphthylamine 4 sulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 4,8 disulphonic acid 6 nitro 2 naphthylamine 4,8 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 6,8 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 5,7 disulphonic acid 3 and 4 acetylaminoaniline 6 sulphonic acids 2 aminoanisole 4 or 5 sulphonic acids 5 amino 2 hydroxybenzoic acid l naphthylamine 5 , 6 or 7 sulphonic acids 2 naphthylamine 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 or 8 sulphonic acids 1 naphthylamine 3,6 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 1,5 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 1,6 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 6,8 disulphonic acid 6 acetylamino 2 naphthylamine 4, 8 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 3,6,8 trisulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 4,6,8 trisulphonic acid aniline o , m and toluidine 2,4 and 2,5 dimethylaniline 5 methyl 2 methoxyaniline o , m and p chloroaniline o , m and p bromoaniline and amino monoazo compounds obtained by coupling the diazonium salts of any amine listed above with any of the following aniline o and m toluidine o and m anisidine anthranilic acid cresidine 2,5 xylidine 2,5 dimethoxyaniline m aminoacetanilide m aminophenylurea 4 methyl 2 aminobenzoic acid 3 acetylamino 6 methylaniline 3 acetylamino 6 methoxyaniline 3 benzoylaminoaniline l naphthylamine 6 and 7 sulphonic acids 2 ethoxy 1 naphthylamine 6 sulphonic acid. Dyes from such amines may provide valuable acid dyes for the colouration of substrates such as leather, wool or synthetic polyamides. In other instances the dyestuff of formula 6 will be formed by subjecting a dyestuff of the formula EMI8.1 to a reaction or series of reactions which converts the radical A1 to A where A, R, R1 and n have the meanings given above and A1 is the radical of a diazotisable amine A1NH2. The dyestuffs of formula 7 may be obtained by conventional procedures of diazotising amine A1NH2 and coupling with a naphthol sulphonic acid of formula 1 . The reactions used to convert the radical A1 to A may be of various types well known in the dyestuffs art. For example acylamino groups may be hydrolysed to form free amino groups. Conversely, amino groups may be acylated with a variety of agents such as acid chlorides or anhydrides or alkylated with alkyl halides or sulphates. A valuable class of dyes of formula 6 are those in which A is a group of the formula EMI9.1 where R, R1 and n have the meanings given above, B is derived from the radical of a diazotisable amine which has a substituent capable of reacting with a reagent with two reactive atoms or groups to form the bridging atom or group X. Such dyes are formed by reacting two moles of a dyestuff of formula 7 in which A provides the precursor to B with one mole of a direactive reagent leading to the formation of the atom or group X.For example two moles of a dyestuff of formula 7 in which A1 has an NH2 substituent may be reacted with one mole of phosgene leading to dyes in which the entity B X B in formula 8 is NH.CO.NH. Alternatively the chlorides of dibasic acids Rê COOH 2 may be used in place of phosgene to give a B X B entity of the form NH. CO. R2. CO. Doubled up dyes of this type can be of value as direct dyes for substrates such as paper or cotton. Direct dyes may also be obtained by linking two moles of a chlorotriazinyl dye as described below with one mole of a diamine. A preferred class of dyestuffs of formula 6 are those in which the radical A contains a cellulose reactive group Qê and it is especially preferred that A is of the formula EMI10.1 The cellulose reactive group Qê may be of any conventional type which forms a covalent bond with cellulose in the presence of an acid binding agent usually an alkali. As examples of such cellulosereactive groups there may be mentioned vinyl sulphonyl and beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl groups attached to a carbon atom of the dyestuff but it is usually preferred that it is of the form NR7Q where 7R is lower alkyl especially H and Q is a cellulose reactive group. The group Q may be introduced by reacting a dyestuff of formula 7 in which the radical AÚ contains a NHR7 group with carbyl sulphate or a compound Qhal where hal is halogen and Q is a cellulose reactive group other than beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl. Alternatively a diazotisable amine containing a NHR7 group may be reacted with carbyl sulphate or Qhal before it is diazotised and coupled to form a dyestuff of formula 6 . The reaction of carbyl sulphate or Qhal with the group NHR7 may be achieved under conventional conditions, e.g. in an aqueous medium at a temperature of 0 100 C depending on the reactivity of the reactants. It is usually desirable to maintain the pH at say 4 8 especially 6 7 by addition of acid binding agent. The reactive group Q on the dyestuff may be subject to modifying reactions, e.g. chlorotriazinyl groups may be quaternised, in a manner well known to the reactive dye art. The cellulose reactive group Q is any group capable of forming a covalent bond with a cellulose substrate under alkaline conditions.The group Q may be any conventional cellulose reactive group of this type such as those disclosed in the patent specifications and other literature on reactive dyes, e.g. UK Patent Specification No.1440948. As examples of cellulose reactive groups, there may be mentioned aliphatic sulphonyl groups which contain a sulphate ester group in beta position to the sulphur atom, e.g. beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl groups, alpha,beta unsaturated acyl radicals of aliphatic carboxylic acids, for example acrylic acid, alpha chloroacrylic acid, alpha bromoacrylic acid, propionic acid, maleic acid and mono and dichloro maleic acids also the acyl radicals of acids which contain a substituent which reacts with cellulose in the presence of an alkali, e.g. the radical of a halogenated aliphatic acid such as chloroacetic acid, beta chloro and beta bromopropionic acids and alpha,betadichloro and dibromopropionic acids or radicals of vinylsulphonyl or beta chloroethylsulphonyl or beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl endomethylene cyclohexane carboxylic acids.Other examples of cellulose reactive groups are tetrafluorocyclobutyl carbonyl trifluorocyclobutenyl carbonyl tetrafluorocyclobutylethenyl carbonyl trif luoro cyclobut enylethenyl carbonyl activated halogenated 1,3 dicyanobenzene radicals such as 2,4 dicyano 3,5 difluoro 6 chlorophenyl 2,4 dicyano 3,5 difluoro 6 nitrophenyl 2,4 dicyano 3,5,6 trifluorophenyl 2,4 dicyano 3,5,6 trichlorophenyl 2,4,6 tricyano 3,5 difluorophenyl 2,4,6 tricyano 3,5 dichlorophenyl and heterocyclic radicals which contain 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring and at least one cellulose reactive substituent on a carbon atom of the ring. It may be noted that many reactive groups may be defined as both heterocyclic or acyl groups since they consist of an acyl group carrying a heterocyclic substituent. For convenience in such cases where the heterocyclic ring carries the cellulose substituent these are usually referred to as heterocyclic reactive groups in this specification. As examples of such heterocyclic radicals there may be mentioned for example 2,3 dichloroquinoxaline 5 or 6 sulphonyl 2,3 dichloroquinoxaline 5 or 6 carbonyl 2,4 dichloroquinazolin 6 or 7 sulphonyl 2,4,6 trichloroquinazolin 7 or 8 sulphonyl 2,4,7 or 2,4,8 trichloroquinazolin 6 sulphonyl 2,4 dichloroquinazolin 6 carbonyl 1,4 dichlorophthalazine 6 carbonyl 4, 5 dichloropyridazon 1 yl ethylcarbonyl 2,4 dichloropyrimidine 5 carbonyl 4 4 ,5 dichloropyridaz 6 on 1 yl benzoyl 2 chlorobenzthiazole 6 carbonyl 3,6 dichloropyrazin 4 carbonyl 4 4 ,5 dichloropyridaz 6t on 1 yl phenylsulphonyl activated 4,6 dihalopyridin 2 yl and 2,6 dihalopyridin 4 yl groups such as 3,4,5,6 tetrafluoropyridin 2 yl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluoropyridin 4 yl 2,4,6 trifluoro 3 cyanopyridin 4 yl 2,5,6 trichloro 3 cyanopyridin 4 yl 2, 6 difluoro 3 cyano 5 chloropyridin 4 yl 2,6 difluoro 3,5 dichloropyridin 4 yl and more particularly triazinyl or pyrimidinyl groups. Examples of particular pyrimidinyl groups are pyrimidin 2 yl or 4 yl groups having a cellulose reactive atom or group especially Cl, Br or F in at least one of the remaining 2, 4 and 6 positions. The 5 position may carry various substituents such as C1 or CN which are not normally cellulose reactive in themselves but enhance the reactivity of substituents in other positions of the pyrimidine ring.As specific examples of such pyrimidinyl groups there may be mentioned 2,6 dichloropyrimidin 4 yl 4,6 dichloropyrimidin 2 yl 2,5, 6 trichloropyrimidin 4 yl 4,5,6 trichloropyrimidin 2 yl 5 chloro 2 methylsulphonyl 6 methylpyrimidin 4 yl 2,6 dichloro 5 cyanopyrimidin 4 yl 4,6 dichloro 5 cyanopyrimidin 2 yl 2,6 difluoro 5 chloropyrimidin 4 yl 4,6 difluoro 5 chloropyrimidin 2 yl 2,6 difluoro 5 cyanopyrimidin 4 yl 4,6 difluoro 5 cyanopyrimidin 2 yl. Examples of particular triazinyl groups are triazin 2 yl groups having cellulose reactive atoms or groups on one or both of the 4 and 6 positions. In this instance a wide range of cellulose reactive atoms or groups are available such as activated aryloxy or various groups linked through a sulphur atom but the preferred reactive atoms or groups are F, Br or especially C1, quaternary ammonium groups such as tri lower alkyl ammonium, e.g. CH3 3N and pyridinium groups especially those derived from pyridine carboxylic acids in particular from nicotinic acid. The triazinyl groups having only one reactive atom or group on the nucleus in the 4 or 6 position may have a substituent not reactive to cellulose in the remaining 4 or 6 position. As examples of such non reactive substituents there may be mentioned alkyl or aryl thio groups, alkoxy or aryloxy groups and optionally substituted amino groups. Preferred forms of these groups include lower, i.e. C14 alkoxy, e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy and iso propoxy, butoxy and lower alkoxy lower alkoxy, e.g. beta methoxyethoxy, beta ethoxyethoxy phenoxy and sulphophenoxy amino lower alkylamino, e.g. methylamino, ethylamino, butylamino, di lower alkyl amino, e.g. dimethylamino, diethylamino, methylethylamino, dibutylamino and groups of the latter two types in which the alkyl groups are substituted in particular by OH,CN or S03H, e.g. beta hydroxyethylamino, di beta hydroxyethyl amino, beta cyanoethylamino, di beta cyanoethyl amino, beta sulpho ethylamino, beta hydroxypropylamino, beta hydroxybutyl ethylamino and beta hydroxyethyl methylamino cycloalkylamino, e.g. cyclohexylamino cyclic amino, e.g. morpholino, piperazino or piperidine, naphthylamino substituted by 1, 2 or 3 SO3H groups and optionally substituted phenylamino groups. As a particularly preferred form of the optionally substituted phenylamino groups there may be mentioned groups of the formula EMI14.1 where G is H, methyl, ethyl, omega sulphomethyl, beta carboxy , beta hydroxy or beta cyanoethyl and Z and X are each independently selected from H, COOH, S03H, CH3, C2H5, OCH3, OC2H5, C1, Br, CN, N02 andNHCOCH3. As specific examples of such groups there may be mentioned anilino m m and p sulphoanilino o , m and p carboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho 2 carboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho o tolylamino 2,4 , 2,5 and 3,5 disulphoanilino 2,4 dicarboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho 2 methoxyanilinoN methyl o , m and p sulphoanilino N omega sulphomethylanilinoN beta hydroxyethyl 3 sulphoanilino. If desired, the cellulose reactive group Q may take the form Ht Dm Q1 where Ht is a s triazine nucleus which contains a cellulose reactive atom or group, Dm represents a diamine residue linking Ht and Q1 by the two amino groups and Q1 is a cellulose reactive group having the meaning stated above for Q. In particular it is usually preferred that the cellulosereactive atom or group on Ht is F, Br or especially Cl and that Q1 is a s triazine residue as defined above for Q. When symbol Q represents a s triazine ring containing a halogen atom and a non reactive substituent, the latter can be the residue of a coloured amine, e.g. of the azo, anthraquinone or phthalocyanine series, but more especially a residue of the dyestuff of formula 7 so that the dyestuff as a whole contains two residues of these dyes bearing Nor7 groups linked by a halo s triazine radical or two such residues linked through two halo s triazine groups and a diamine radical Dm as given above. In these dyestuffs the halogen may be F or Br but it is usually preferred that it is C1. As examples of the diamines DmH2 which may provide the residue Dm there may be mentioned heterocyclic diamines e.g. piperazine aliphatic diamines e.g. alkylene, hydroxyalkylene or sulphato alkylene diamines especially those having 2 6 carbon atoms e.g.ethylene diamine 1,2 and 1,3 propylene diamines 1,6 diaminohexane beta hydroxyethylaminoethylamine 2 hydroxy 1,3 diaminopropane 2 sulphato 1,3 diaminopropane other alpha, omega diamino aliphatic compounds e.g.triethylene tetramine di beta aminoethyl ether naphthylene diamine sulphonic acids e.g.2,6 diaminonaphthalene 1,5 and 4,8 disulphonic acids 1,5 diaminonaphthalene 3,7 disulphonic acids and diamine derivatives of mono and di cyclic compounds of the benzene series, e.g. phenylene diamines and their mono and disulphonic acids, e.g.m and p phenylene diamines 1,3 phenylenediamine 5 sulphonic and 4 6 sulphonic acids 1, 4 phenylenediamine 2 sulphonic and 2,5 disulphonic acids diamines of the formula EMI16.1 where p and q are each 0 or 1 and E is a direct link or a group selected from S02, CH2, C2H4, NH, NHCONH, e.g.4,4 diaminostilbene 2,2 disulphonic acid benzidine 2 sulphonic and 2,2 disulphonic acids 3,3 and 4,4 diaminodiphenylureas 4,4 diaminodiphenylurea 2,2 and 3,3 disulphonic acids 4,4 diaminodiphenylamine 2,21 disulphonic acid 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane 2,2 disulphonic acid 4,4 diaminophenyl sulphone and the N lower alkyl and N,N di lower alkyl derivatives of the above diamines, e.g.4 methylamino and 4 ethylaminoaniline 2 sulphonic acidsN,N dimethyl 4,4 diaminodiphenylamino 2,2 disulphonic acid. Cellulose reactive dyes of formula 6 usually exhibit a good balance of water solubility and colouring power often superior to closely related dyes such as those from acetyl or benzoyl amino naphthol sulphonic acid coupling components. Further these dyes show good fastness to light and washing and are especially valuable in discharge printing applications. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Example 1 H acid 0.05M as the monosodium salt was added to 100ml water and dissolved by the addition of sufficient 2M sodium hydroxide solution to raise the pH to 7.0. Sodium cyanate 5g was added followed by 2M hydrochloric acid 30ml added dropwise over 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at 200C and the course of the reaction was followed by HPLC. After 4 hours no H acid could be detected either by HPLC or by reaction with Erlichs reagent which gives a strong orange colouration with H acid. The solution was used to prepare azo dyestuffs directly. The structure of the product is believed to be formula 3 withR R1 H.Example 2 H acid O.lM was stirred into water 250ml and the pH raised to 5.8 by addition of sodium bicarbonate. N propyl isocyanate 20ml was added dropwise to the solution over 1 hour and, after stirring for a further 30 minutes, the mixture was analysed by HPLC. No H acid was detected in the reaction but two products were observed. Sodium carbonate was then added to raise the pH to 9.5 and the mixture stirred a further 1 hour. HPLC analysis now showed only one product to be present. The second product was assumed to be the urethane prepared by reaction of the isocyanate at both 0 and N atoms and as expected the urethane was hydrolysed at pH 9.5 . The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 7 by addition of hydrochloric acid and then salted to 10 . The crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration and dried at 300 C. Yield of grey powder 39.6g. The structure of the product is believed to be formula 3 in which R H and R1 n propyl.Examples 3 9 Cyclic urethane of formula 5 with 3,6 sulphonic acid groups MilO was stirred in methanol 200ml and ethanolamine 50ml was added. The mixture was refluxed for 20 hours. The product in solution is believed to have the structure given by formula 3 with R H and R1 CH2CH20H. The methanolic solution was used directly to prepare dyestuffs. By replacing the ethanolamine with an equivalent amount of the amines detailed below solutions were prepared of other naphthol sulphonic acids of formula 3 with R and RÚ as given. Example Amine R RÚ 4 methylamine H CH3 5 dimethylamine CH3 CH3 6 ethylamine H C2H5 7 n propylamine H n C H 8 gamma dimethylaminopropylamine H CH2 3.N CH3 2 9 n butylamine H n C H The cyclic urethane for use in the above was obtained by either of the following methods. A. The procedure of Example l was repeated. When the reaction was deemed complete i.e. when no H acid could be detected in the reaction mixture the mixture was heated to 65UC for 2 hours.Completion of cyclisation was shown by the absence of a colour reaction when a sample of the solution was contacted with diazotised p chloraniline solution. The solution was cooled to 200C and salted to 20 . The precipitated product was collected by filtration, washed with 20 brine and dried at 600C. Yield of grey solid 20g. B. Method of Balaban King, J.C.S. 1927, 3091. Phosgene 0.32M was bubbled through a neutral solution of H acid 0.3M in water 1250ml at ambient temperature. The pH of the solution was allowed to fall to 5.0 and was maintained at 5.0 by addition of sodium hydroxide solution. After 3.5 hours analysis by HPLC showed the reaction to be complete. The pH was then adjusted to 2.0 and the product collected by filtration, washed with brine and dried. Elementary analysis gave C 28.5 , H 2.4 , N 3.0 , S 13.1 . The sample contained 17.4 water.When adjusted accordingly the required analytical values are C 28.65 ,H 2.8 , N 3.05 , S 13.9 . The product is identical HPLC and IR spectrum with that obtained by method A. The yield of pale grey powder was 136g.Example 10 A solution of m phenylenediamine sulphonic acid M 40 in water 50ml and 2M sodium hydroxide 12.5ml was added to an ice cold suspension of cyanuric chloride 4.63g in water 200ml . After stirring 1 hour the pH was raised to 7.0 by addition of 2M sodium hydroxide and 2M sodium nitrite 12.5ml was added followed by 2M hydrochloric acid 32ml . The pale yellow suspension was stirred at 50C for 1 hour. A solution of the product of Example 1 containing m 40 of the ureido naphthol sulphonic acid was diluted to 200 ml and the pH was adjusted to 3 4 by addition of hydrochloric acid. The diazonium salt suspension was then added and the pH slowly raised to 5.5 by addition of sodium hydroxide solution. When the coupling reaction was judged to be complete the resulting dyestuff was precipitated from solution by salting to 10 , collected by filtration and dried. The dyestuff has the structure EMI20.1 It has high solubility in cold water and dyes cotton under both pad batch and exhaust dyeing conditions to give fully dischargeable bright red shades. It shows exceptionally good build up properties, particularly by pad batch application.Examples 11 14 By repeating the procedure of Example 10 replacing the product of Example 1 with equivalent amounts of the products of Examples 2, 3, 5 and 8 respectively, similar dyes were obtained.Examples 15 19 The dye preparations given in Examples 10 14 were repeated replacing the cyanuric chloride with an equivalent amount of 5 cyano2,3,6 trichloropyrimidine to yield similar dyes. The dichlorotriazinyl dyes obtained in Examples 10 14 inclusive were used to prepare monochlorotriazinyl products by the following general methods.Example 20 The dyestuff of Example 10 was estimated by titration with 0.1N titanous chloride solution. 232g at Mol.In.3781g were dissolved in 1600ml cold water with stirring and a solution of metanilic acid, 10.66g dissolved in water lOOml and sufficient 2N sodium carbonate solution to raise the pH to 6 7 by further small additions of sodium carbonate solution. When the reaction was judged by HPLC to be complete the mixture was cooled whereupon the product crystallised from solution. It was collected by filtration and dried. The product had the structure EMI21.1 where R R H. It is applied to cellulosic textile materials under alkaline conditions to give bright red shades having very high fastness to wet treatments and to light. By similar methods, the dyestuffs of Examples 11 14 were converted to products in whichExample 21 R H RÚ CH2CH2CH3 Example 22 R H RÚ C2H4OH Example 23 R CH3 RÚ CH3 Example 24 R H RÚ C3H6N CH3 2 2 Example 25 A further 68.8g sample of the dyestuff of Example 10 atMol.In.1089g were dissolved in 800ml of cold water. A solution of p phenylenediamine 3.4g dissolved in water 100ml by the addition of 2N hydrochloric acid, was added and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to pH 6 7. The temperature was raised to 300C until the reaction was judged by HPLC to be complete and then allowed to fall to ambient temperature. The product which had crystallised was collected by filtration and dried. It had the structure EMI22.1 wherein Z is a monoazo structure of the formula EMI23.1 and R RÚ H. The dye can be applied to cellulosic textile materials under typical alkaline hot dyeing conditions. Similarly the dyestuffs of Examples 11 14 were converted to dyestuffs of the formula EMI23.2 wherein Example 26 R H RÚ CH2CH2CH3Example 27 R H RÚ C2H4OH Example 28 R CH3 RÚ CH3Example 29 R H RÚ C3H6N CH3 2Examples 30 32 Dyestuffs suitable for application by typical direct dyeing processes may be prepared as in Examples 25 29 above by reaction with amines. Thus the dyestuff of Example 25 where R R1 H was treated with excess monoethanolamine in aqueous solution at 800C to yield a product with structure EMI24.1 wherein Z1 is a monoazo structure of the formula EMI24.2 and R R1 H. The product was applied to cellulosic textile material under direct dyeing conditions, i.e. applied from a boiling aqueous dyebath in the presence of sodium chloride or sodium sulphate, to yield a full bright red shade having good fastness to light and to wet treatments. By replacing the ethanolamine with diethanolamine and with morpholine, dyes were produced with similarly good yield and build up under direct dyeing conditions. Example 33 30.3g of p sodium beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl aniline were dissolved in 250ml of water at 0 50C and treated successively with 55ml of 2N molar sodium nitrite solution and 150ml of 2N hydrochloric acid solution. The resultant diazonium chloride solution was added to a solution containing 0.1 mole of the coupling component prepared as described in Example 1 at 0 50C and pH 6. When the coupling reaction was complete, the dyestuff was precipitated from solution by the addition of sodium chloride, collected by filtration and dried. The dye had high solubility in cold water and dyed cotton under pad batch, exhaust dyeing, printing and continuous steam or thermofix dyeing conditions to give fully dischargeable bright red shades. It showed exceptionally good build up properties particularly in pad batch application. The dyestuff has the structure EMI25.1 where R R H. Examples 34 37 By replacing the product of Example 1 in the method of Example 33 with equivalent amounts of the products of Examples 2, 3, 5 and 8 respectively, similar dyes were obtained.Examples 38 43 By replacing the p sodium beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl aniline in Examples 33 37 with the corresponding m isomer a second series of yellower shade bright red dyestuffs was produced. Example 44 26.1g of dodecylaniline were dissolved in 100ml of glacial acetic acid and 50ml of water and treated successively with 55ml of 2 molar sodium nitrite solution and 25ml of 36 hydrochloric acid solution at 0 50C. After stirring to complete the diazotisation reaction, the suspension was added to a solution containing 0.1 mole of the naphthol sulphonic acid of Example 3. 50g of sodium acetate were added and the mixture stirred at 0 100C for 12 hours. The resultant dyestuff precipitate was collected and washed with cold water then dried. 53g of a dyestuff having the structure EMI26.1 were obtained. It dyes polyamide textile materials, particularly nylon and wool from weakly acid dyebaths to give bright bluish red shades with exceptionally high fastness to wet treatments.
