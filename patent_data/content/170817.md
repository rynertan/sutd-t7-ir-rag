# A high purity powder of hexagonal boron nitride and a method for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for the preparation of an upgraded high purity powder of hexagonal boron nitride still having low crystallinity to retain activity for sintering. The first method comprises the steps of admixing a crude powder of hexagonal boron nitride with a carbonaceous material and heating the blend in a stream of an inert gas. The second method comprises the steps of admixing the powdery blend of boric acid or boron oxide as the boron source and a nitrogen compound as the nitrogen source with borax or anhydrous borax, heating the powdery blend to form a crude powder of hexagonal boron nitride, admix ing the crude powder of hexagonal boron nitride with a carbonaceous powder, and heating the powdery blend at a temperature of 1300 C or higher in a stream of an inert gas.
