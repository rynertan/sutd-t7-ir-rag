# A circuit breaker comprising parallel connected sections.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker 10 comprising two or more sections 12, 14 and 16 connected in parallel with each other. Each section 12, 14 or 16 of the circuit breaker comprises an electromagnetic sensing device 50,50a or 50b and a pair of relatively movable contacts 34,38 34a,38a or 34b,38b . The electromagnetic sensing devices 50,50a or 50b are electric ally connected at one of their ends to the load terminals 54, 54a or 54b . The load terminals 54, 54a or 54b are electrically connected in parallel with each other by a bar 49 . The electromagnetic sensing devices 50, 50a and 50b are electrically connected at their other ends to each other and are also electrically connected to all of the movable arms 36, 36a and 36b which support the movable contacts 34, 34a and 34b . The movable contacts 34, 34a and 34b are engageable with stationary contacts 38,38a and 38b carried by line terminals 40, 40a and 40b which are themselves all electrically connected in parallel with each other by a bar 47 . Thus, the electromagnetic sensing devices 50, 50a and 50b are connected in parallel at both of their electrical ends and the relatively movable contacts 34,38 34a,38a and 34b,38b are also connected in parallel at both of their electrical ends while the electromagnetic sensing devices 50, 50a and 50b on the one hand, and the relatively movable contacts 34,38 34a,38a and 34b,38b on the other hand, are also in series with each other, whereby the current is divided equally among all of the electromagnetic sensing devices 50, 50a and 50b even though the current may not be equally divided among all of the relatively movable contacts 34,38 34a,38a and 34b,38b because of varying contact resistances.
