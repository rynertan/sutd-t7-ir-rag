# A process for the preparation of a powder detergent composition of high bulk density.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a nonionic surfactant containing powder detergent composi tion wherein a spray dried sodium sulphate free base pow der containing a portionof the nonionic surfactant is obtained and the remaining portion of the nonionic surfac tant is in part sprayed onto the base powder and in part added subsequently in a form obtained by granulation with a carrier containing a mixture of zeolite and alkali metal perborate monhydrate and wherein the other detergent components are added subsequently to the base powder. A detergent composition prepared in this manner has a high bulk density despite its high AD content.
