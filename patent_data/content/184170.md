Detailed DescriPtion The compounds of formula I, contain at least one chiral center, and as such exist as two individual isomers or as a mixture of both, This invention relates to the levorotatory isomer t , as well as mixtures containing both the d and the t isomers. Additional chiral centers may be present in the groups A and or B and this invention relates to all possible stereoisomers and various isomeric mixtures in these groups. For the purposes of this invention, the Q isomer of compounds of formula I, is intended to mean compounds of the configuration depicted EMI10.1 Synthesis Compounds of Formula I can be prepared as follows Scheme 1 EMI11.1 Where Hz may be 4 tolyl, phenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, C1 C4 alkyl or haloalkyl, such as trifluoromethyl.When either synthetic path a or path b is used, the group A may be H or any of the groups previously shown. Compounds of Formula II iay be converted to sulfonate esters ifs by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl halide or sulfonic anhydride in a solvent pAus a base or in a basic organic solvent such as pyridine. As solvents, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dioxane, bis 2 methoxyethyl ether, N,N dimethylformamide DMF , N, flimethylacetamide DMAc , acetonitrile, or tetramethylenesulfone may be used. As a base, triethylamine, N methylmorpholine, tributylamine or one of the heterocyclic bases can be used. Compounds III may be reacted with sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium or rubidium azides in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, N methylpyrrolidone, DMAc, sulfolane, dimethylsulfoxide, tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA , etc. along with the appropriate catalyst such as 18 crown 6 or 15 crown 5 for sodium and potassium azide and 12 crown 4 for lithium azide. This reaction is carried out from about 60e to 125etc, with the preferred temperatures being 70e to 90DC. The products are azides of structure IV . The azides IV may be reduced by any of several methods, including hydrogenation over palladium oncharcoal. It is also possible to reduce the azides by treating with 1,3 propanedithiol and a base such as triethylamine. Azides may also be reduced to amines by hydrogen sulfide and by trivalent phosphorous compounds such as trimethylphosphine and trimethylphosphite, and by mercaptans such as mercaptoacetic acid.Reduction with hydrogen can be used where A is a functional group resistant to hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis. The reduction is carried out using a solvent such as ethanol, methanol, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or isopropanol. A solution may be stirred at ambient temperature with palladium oncharcoal catalyst present and the hydrogen introduced at atmospheric pressure through a glass frit. In some instances the reduction is exothermic. The reduction using 1,3 propanedithiol is carried out in methanol or other alcohol solvents containing an equivalent of triethylamine, by warming until N2 volution occurs. At ambient temperatures, slow reduction occurs, Temperatures of 20 to 100 C may be used temperatures of 40 to 600C are preferred.Warming an azide IV with trimethylphosphite causes a rapid evolution of N2. The reaction may be carried out in 1,2 dimethoxyethane or bis 2 methoxyethyl ether and the crude intermediate, when hydrolyzed with water or acid, gives the desired amine V . The aminomethyl compounds V are acylated by react ion of the amine with an acid chloride or anhydride in a basic solvent such as pyridine or by reaction in a water miscible solvent such as THF or 1,2 dimethoxyethane in the presence of an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate. When pyridine is used as solvent for the reaction, the acid chloride or anhydride is added to the mixture at 0 to 10 C. The reaction may be carried out between 3Q0 and 50 C. With very reactive acid chlorides of anhydrides such as trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride or anhydride the reaction is preferably carried eut at 60 to 400C. The acylations using aqueous bases are done by stirring the amine V in a water miscible solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF , 1,2 dimethoxyethane, or dioxane and adding 1 5 N NaOH to keep the mixture basic as the acid chloride or a ht is added, while keeping the temperature between 5 and gooc. The compounds V can also be acylated by any of the standard peptide synthesis methods where the free acid is reacted with the amine using N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or where a mixed anhydride is first formed from the acid using a chloroformate ester sag a tertiary b e such as triethylamine, followed by reaction with the amine, In the mixed anhydride procedure, the acid to be used is allowed to react with a chloroformate such as ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate in a solvent such as THF, DMF or 1,2 dimethoxyethane, in the presence of a tertiary base such as triethylamine or N methylmorpholine at 30 to 100 C. To this mixture the amine V is added and the mixture stirred at 100C for 1 5 hours, When N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is used as the condensing agent, the conditions and solvents may be the same but it is often advantageous to add N hydroxyphthalimide or N hydroxysuccinimide. Further, these amines may be acylated by reaction with esters such as methyl dichloroacetate, ethyl trifluoroacetate or n butyl formate. In this method, the amine V is combined with the ester and a solvent such as 1,2 dimethoxyethane, bis 2 methoxyethyl ether. or toluene in some cases the ester may be used as the solvent and the mixture is heated at reflux until the reaction is shown to be complete by an assay such as thin layer chromatography. More reactive esters such as g nitrophenyl esters, pentafluorophenyl esters, thio esters, enol esters, N hydroxyphthalimide esters,N hydroxysuccinimide esters, l hydroxybenzotriazole esters, 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl esters, and pentachioro phenyl esters, may be used. Further, other acylatgng agents such as acyl azides, acyl imidazoles and acyl phosphates, may be used. When synthetic path b is used, the sulfonate ester III is allowed to react with an amide in the form of its sodium or potassium salt, generated usingNaH, KH or KOC4H9 t in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, DMAc, HMPA, N methylpyrroltdinone, or tetramethylenesulfone. To the salt preparation is added the sulfonate ester III and the mixture is heated to 30C to 1500C. A catalyst such as 18 crown 6 may be used. Heating is continued for 3 50 hours. In Scheme 1, the starting compound 11 may be dQ the racemate or the Q isomer. The t isomer is a precursor for the preferred Q amides VI . When the acylating group is derived from an amino acid and R13 contains an amino function it is necessary to protect that amino function with one of the commonly used protective groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl, t butyloxycarbonyl, 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl, or phthaloyl. Following the acylation, the protective group is removed by one of the standard methods to which the oxazolidinone ring is inert. The benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed by hydrogenation in a solvent such as methanol, DMF, acetic acid, or mixtures of these solvents, using a catalyst such as 10b palladium on carbon or palladium black 100 to 500 mg of catalyst per mmole of compound .Alternatively the benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed by dissolving the compound in acetic acid, adding an equal volume of 4 N HBr in acetic acid, and keeping the solution at room temperature for 1 to 5 hours. The N t butyloxycarbonyl groups are removed by hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature. EMI16.1 Compounds of formula I which may be made using the procedures of Scheme 2 are those where A is H or any of the groups previously shown. L may be any suitable leaving group such as I, Br,C1., benzenesulfonyloxy, 4 toluenesulfonyloxy, methanesulfonyloxy or trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy. In route a the compound VII is allowed to.react with ammonia or an amine in a solvent such as ethanol at temperatures of 50 to 1500C. Where the amine or solvent is low boiling, the reaction is carried out in a sealed vessel to allow the desired temperature to be reached. The solvent may be ethanol, DMF, DMAc,N methylpyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfone, orHMPA. The reaction time may be 1 to 24 hours. Where VII is optically active i.e., the t isomer the product is optically active.The acylation of productVIII is carried out as described for Scheme 1, Path a . The reaction of VII with the anion of a sulfonamide shown in Scheme 2, Path b is carried out in a polar solvent such as DMF, DMAc, N methylpyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfone, or HMPA. In some cases the use of a catalyst such as 18 crown 6 may improve the reaction, Temperatures of 50 to 1500C are employed the time for the reaction can vary between 2 to 48 hours. Alternatively, the sulfonamides IX can be prepared by reaction of the amine VIII with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or a basic solvent such as pyridine Path c l. Scheme 3 EMI17.1 The acylation of Scheme 3, Path a is carried out by reacting the compounds of formula VI A.H with an excess of an acid anhydride in methanesulfonic acid. This acylation may be carried out at room temperature, over time periods of 2 10 hours.Alternatively, the acylation can be carried out with an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a mixture of phosphorous pentoxide or methanesulfonic anhydride in methanesulfonic acid. During the reaction, the amide nitrogen may be simultaneously substituted with a second acyl group which is removed in the aqueous work up or by treatment with an alcohol such as methanol. The acylated compounds IVY may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol IVIl as shown in Scheme 3,Path b . The reduction can be carried out using sodium borohydride in an alcohol solvent such as ethanol, or via other mild metal borohydride reagents such as lithium borohydride, lithium tri t butoxyaluminum hydride, tetramethylammonium borohydride or the like. The reactions of Scheme 3 may be carried out starting with the Q isomer of IVY where A H to give products of the preferred form. An alternative synthesis of the glycinamides ofFormula I where B isEMI19.1 wherein R13 is CH2NH2 as well as compounds where R13 is CR2N3 is shown in Scheme 4. Scheme 4 EMI19.2 Glycine amides XXXIV may be prepared by making the chloroacetyl or bromoacetyl or iodoacetyl compounds XXXII followed by reacting these with sodium azide in dimethylsulfoxide or other dipolar aprotic solvents to give the azidoacetyl compounds XXXIII . The azidoacetyl compounds then may be reduced by hydrogen using a palladium catalyst or by any of the other reduction methods such as 1,3 propanedithiol and triethylamine, thioglycolic acid or hydrogen sulfide.The products are the glycine amides XXXIV . The compounds of Formula I where A is CR23 R16 R17 orEMI20.1 are obtained as shown inScheme 5.Scheme 5 EMI20.2 Ketalization, as shown in Scheme 5, Path a can be carried out by reacting the ketone derivative XXXV with an appropriate ortho ester in an alcohol solvent such as ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as toluenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid or the like to give the corresponding dialkyl acetal. The reaction can be promoted by removing the ester by product by distillation. Cyclic ketals can be prepared by treatment of the ketone with ethylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol in an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a catalytic amount of an organic acid such as toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, adipic acid, or the like. Reaction of the ketones XXXV with a hydroxylamine or hydrazine gives the corresponding oxime or hydrazone derivative XXXVII . The reaction is carried out in a solvent mixture of pyridine in ethanol at a temperature of 500C to the reflux temperature of the solvent mixture. The hydrazone XXXVII whereR7 H may be acylated using an acyl halide or an acyl anhydride in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine or triethylamine in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or DMF. A catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine may be used. Scheme 6 EMI22.1 Amines XLII can be prepared by reduction as shown in Scheme 6 from the oxime derivatives XXXVII using a reducing agent such as 10 palladium on carbon in a solvent such as acetic acid or an alcohol solvent such as ethanol. The amines XLI 1 may be acylated using an acyl anhydride or acyl halide in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran. A catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine may be used. A method for preparing secondary or tertiary amines XLV is shown in Scheme 6, Path b wherein the halo compound XLIV can be prepared from the alcohol by reaction with thionyl chloride. Alternatively, the alcohol can be reacted with triphenylphosphine in carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide. The halo compound XLIV can then be reacted with an amine.For low boiling amines. the reaction can be carried out under pressure. For higher boiling amines, a mixture of XLIV is stirred optionally in a polar aprotic solvent or an alcoholic solvent at a temperature of 50 1500C. An alternative synthesis of compounds of structure V is shown in Scheme 7. wC2f tE 7 EMI24.1 In Scheme 7, A may be H, or any of the groups previously shown except groups which are known to react with hydrazine. L may be any suitable leaving group such as I, Br, C1, benzenesulfonyloxy, 4 toluenesulfonyloxy. methanesulfonyloxy, or trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy. The reaction is carried out by heating at temperatures of 250 to 1500C in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, DMAc, N methylpyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfone or HMPA. The phthalimide group is then removed by treatment with hydrazine in alcohol at 200C to 50etc for 5 30 hours followed by adjusting to neutral pH with acid. An alternate method is first to react XLVI with sodium sulfide, then to dehydrate with N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, followed by reaction with hydrazine and then treatment with dilute acid.This last method is very mild. The alcohols II and halides VII required as starting materials are readily available by any of a number of standard methods for the preparation of oxazolidones. M. E. Dyen and D. Swern, Chem.
