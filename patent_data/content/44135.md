# Process for production of oxidation resistant hydrocarbon oil composition and oxidation resistant composition made thereby.

## Abstract
An oxidation resistant hydrocarbon oil composition is made by catalytically hydrogen refining under relatively severe conditions a hydrocarbon oil basestock boiling in the lube oil boiling range and separately catalytically hydrogen refining under relatively mild conditions a hydrocarbon fraction boiling in the lube oil range and having an aniline point at least 60 C and a sulfur content of at least 2.0 wt . The resulting severely refined basestock has a sulfur content not greater than 0.10 wt and the resulting mildly refined fraction has a sulfur content of at least 1.0 wt , and the desired oxidation resistant composition is a blend compris ing 85 to 99.9 wt of the former and 15 to 0.1 wt of the latter.
