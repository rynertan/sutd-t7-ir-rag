## Description
This invention relates to a catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins. Concerning Ziegler Natta type catalysts which are effective in polymerizing olefins, catalyst components having transition metals deposited on various kinds of carriers have been developed for the purpose of improving catalyst activity per unit amount of catalyst or decreasing residues originating in catalyst and persisting in produced polymer. Heretofore various methods have been tried for the preparation of catalyst components which have inorganic carriers such as silica and alumina held in contact with organic magnesium compounds and further have titanium halide compounds held in contact therewith. The catalyst components obtained by these conventional methods suffer from insufficient catalytic activity as their salient disadvantage. Recently, a catalyst component obtained by causing hydrocarbyloxysilane to react upon a reaction product of a porous carrier such as silica and an alkyl magnesium compound and subsequently causing a titanium halide compound to react upon the resultant reaction product U.S. Patent No 4,335,016 assigned to Chemplex and a catalyst component obtained by causing an organic metal compound to react upon a porous carrier, causing a hydrocarbyl alcohol to react upon the resultant reaction product, and then causing a titanium halide compound to react on the reaction product U.S. Patent No. 4,378,304 and 4,458,058, each assigned to Chemplex have been proposed. Although these catalyst components exhibit improved catalytic activity, the polymers obtained by their use have insufficient bulk density and are therefore not desirable. EP A 14523 discloses an olefin polymerisation catalyst prepared by contacting silica, an organic magnesium compound, an ortho ester as Lewis Base, titanium tetrachloride and a halogenating agent such as silican tetrachloride. It is essential in EP A 14523 that a halogenating agent be contacted with the inorganic oxide or the magnesiumhydrocarbon compound before the contacting with a Lewis Base. There is no teaching to avoid use of additional halogenating agent in the early contacting stages. This invention aims to provide a solid catalyst component which in the polymerization of olefins exhibits high activity and enables production of an olefin polymer possessing high bulk density. According to the invention there is provided a titanium containing supported catalyst component comprising the product obtained by contacting The metal oxide to be used in this invention is the oxide of an element selected from the class of elements belonging to Groups II through IV in the Periodic Table of Elements. Examples of the oxides are B₂O₃, MgO, Al₂O₃, SiO₂, CaO, TiO₂, ZnO, ZrO₂, SnO₂, BaO, and ThO₂. Among other oxides enumerated above, B₂O₃, MgO, Al₂O₃, SiO₂, TiO₂, and ZrO₂ are more desirable selections, and SiO₂ is the most desirable selection. Further, composite oxides including these metal oxides are also usable. Examples of these composite oxides are SiO₂ MgO, SiO₂ Al₂O₃, SiO₂ TiO₂, SiO₂ V₂O₅, SiO₂ Cr₂O₃, and SiO₂ TiO₂ MgO. The aforementioned metal oxide or composite oxide described above is fundamentally desired to be an anhydride. It, however, tolerates inclusion of a hydroxide in a very small amount normally entrained in the metal oxide of the class under discussion. It also tolerates inclusion therein of impurities to an extent incapable of appreciably impairing the nature of metal oxide. Examples of the impurities so tolerated are oxides, carbonates, sulfates, and nitrates such as sodium oxide, potassium oxide, lithium oxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, barium sulfate, potassium nitrate, magnesium nitrate, and aluminum nitrate. The metal oxide of the foregoing description is desired to be used in the form of a powder having an X ray diffraction image of large width or an amorphous and minimally crystalline texture. The size and shape of the individual particles of this powder are desired to be suitably adjusted because they often have bearing on the shape of the olefin polymer to be produced. The powder is required to have as large a specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore radius as possible to suit its purpose. Prior to use, this metal oxide is fired at as high a temperature as permissible for the purpose of expelling poisoned substance and then handled so as not to be exposed directly to the atmosphere.

These electron donating compounds are such that two or more members selected from the group of compounds enumerated above can be used as a mixture.

The catalyst which comprises the catalyst component obtained as described above and the organic metal compound and the electron donating compound is useful for catalyzing homopolymerization of a monoolefin or copolymerization of the monoolefin in combination with other monoolefins or diolefins. The catalyst exhibits an outstanding function, particularly in catalyzing homopolymerization of ethylene or random or block copolymerization of ethylene with an alpha olefin of 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as, for example, propylene, l butene, 4 methyl l pentene, l hexene, or l octene, and particularly homopolymerization of an alpha olefin, especially an alpha olefin of 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as, for example, propylene, l butene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, or l hexene, copolymerization of two such alpha olefins as mentioned above, and or random or block copolymerization of such an alpha olefin as mentioned above with ethylene.

When the polymerization is performed in the liquid phase, it can be effected on a liquid monomer in an inactive hydrocarbon such as normal butane, iso butane, normal pentane, iso pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, or xylene. The polymerization temperature falls generally in the range of 80 C to 150 C, preferably in the range of 40 C to 120 C. The polymerization pressure is sufficient in the range of 1 to 60 atmospheres. Adjustment of the molecular weight of the polymer to be obtained is attained by causing the polymerization to proceed in the presence of hydrogen or other known molecular weight adjusting agent. The amount of the other olefin with which the olefin is copolymerized generally is not allowed to exceed 30 by weight and preferably is selected in the range of 0.3 to 15 by weight. The polymerization by the catalyst system of this invention can be carried out continuously or batchwise under those conditions which are generally adopted for the purpose of polymerization. The copolymerization may be performed in one step or in two or more split steps. The catalyst component of the present invention functions effectively particularly in the production of high density polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and alpha olefins such as propylene, 1 butene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, 1 hexene, and 1 octene. The polymerization catalyst using the catalyst component of the present invention possesses high polymerization activity and the co polymer obtained by the use of the polymerization catalyst possesses high bulk density and has particle diameters distributed in a narrow range. Even when the amount of hydrogen used generally as a molecular weight adjusting agent during the polymerization is decreased, the produced polymer possesses a high melt index. Further, the polymerization effected by the use of this polymerization catalyst entails only minimal formation of low molecular polymers soluble in such hydrocarbons as hexane. Now, the present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to the examples and applied examples. The percents mentioned in the examples and the applied examples are percents by weight unless otherwise specified. The melt index MI and the melt flow rate MFR of polymer represent the values determined in accordance with ASTM D 1238. The bulk density represents the value determined by the method as defined in ASTM D 1895 69. The heptane insolubles content HI which shows the proportion of crystalline polymer to the whole of a given polymer represents the residue after six hours extraction of the polymer with boiling n heptane in an improved version of the Soxhlet extractor. A flask having an inner volume of 200 ml and provided with a stirrer had its interior air displaced with nitrogen gas. In the flask, 5 g of silicon oxide SiO₂ product of Davison Corp. having a specific surface area of 302 m² g, a pore volume of 1.54 cm³ g, and an average pore radius of 204 A and marketed under trademark designation of G 952 fired under a flow of nitrogen gas at 200 C for two hours and further at 700 C for five hours and 20 ml of 20 n heptane solution of n butylethyl magnesium hereinafter referred to as BEM 26.8 mmol as BEM the solution being a product of Texas Alkyls Corporation, marketed under trademark designation of MAGALA BEM added thereto were stirred at 90 C for one hour. The supernatant consequently formed was removed by decantation and the solid was washed three times with 50 ml of n hexane at 50 C. The solid substance obtained in the foregoing procedure and 50 ml of n hexane and 20 ml of ortho ethyl formate added thereto were stirred for reaction at 90 C for one hour. The supernatant formed was removed and discarded. The solid substance which remained was washed three times with 50 ml of n hexane at 50 C. The solid substance obtained as described above and 50 ml of toluene and 0.5 ml of titanium tetrachloride added thereto were stirred for reaction at 90 C for two hours. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining solid substance was washed five times with 100 ml of n hexane. The washed solid substance was dried under a vacuum at 65 C for one hour. Consequently, there was obtained 6.3 g of a catalyst component. This catalyst component was found to have a specific surface area of 242 m² g and a pore volume of 0.937 cm³ g. This catalyst component was found to contain 3.8 of magnesium, 4.2 of titanium, 12.5 of chlorine, and 38.8 of SiO₂.

By following the procedure of Example 4, except using ortho methyl acetate in the place of ortho ethyl acetate, there was prepared a catalyst component having a titanium content of 2.9 . By following the procedure of Example 1, except using Al₂O₃ fired under the same conditions as in Example 1 in the place of SiO₂, there was prepared a catalyst component having a titanium content of 1.9 . The washed solid substance obtained by the contact with ortho ethyl formate in the procedure of Example 1 and 50 ml of n heptane and 20 ml of silicon tetrachloride added thereto were stirred for reaction at 50 C for one hour. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining solid substance was washed three times with 50 ml of n hexane at 50 C. The solid substance consequently obtained was held in contact with titanium tetrachloride in the same way as in Example 1. Consequently, there was prepared a catalyst component having a titanium content of 2.2 . Three catalyst components of varying quality were prepared following the procedure of Example 7, except using various compounds E component in the place of silicon tetrachloride and varying the time of treatment as indicated below in Table 1. By following the procedure of Example 1, except omitting the contact with ortho ethyl formate, there was prepared a catalyst component having a titanium content of 10.1 . By following the procedure of Example 1, except 20 ml of tetraethoxy silane Comparative Experiment 2 or 20 ml of ethanol Comparative Experiment 3 in the place of ortho ethyl formate, there were prepared catalyst components having titanium contents of 4.6 Comparative Experiment 2 and 5.2 Comparative Experiment 3 . In an autoclave having an inner volume of 1.5 liters and provided with a stirrer, 77.5 mg of the catalyst component obtained in Example 1, 0.7 mmol of triisobutyl aluminum, and 700 ml of isobutane were placed under a blanket of nitrogen gas. The polymerization system so prepared was heated to 80 C. Then hydrogen was introduced therein until the partial pressure of hydrogen reached 1.5 kg cm² and ethylene was subsequently introduced therein until the partial pressure reached 5 kg cm² and 30 g of 1 butene was added thereto. Polymerization of the monomers was carried out for two hours while ethylene was continuously supplied in such a manner as to retain the total pressure of the polymerization system constant. After completion of the polymerization, the medium and the unaltered ethylene and 1 butene were purged to permit withdrawal of a white powdery polymer. The polymer was dried under a vacuum at 70 C for 10 hours. Consequently, there was obtained 228.1 g of an ethylene 1 butene copolymer having a MI of 1.23 g 10 min., a bulk density of 0.40 g cm³ , and a true density of 0.9277 g cm³ . The specific catalyst activity, Ec, was found to be 294 g g catalyst component hour monomer partial pressure and Et to be 7.08 kg g titanium hour monomer partial pressure. Copolymerization of ethylene and 1 butene was carried out by following the procedure of Applied Example 1, except using the catalyst components obtained in Examples 2 8, Example 10, and Comparative Experiments 1 3 instead. The results are shown in the following Table II. Polymerization of ethylene was carried out by following the procedure of Applied Example 1, except changing the amount of the catalyst component obtained in Example 1 to 65.2 mg, the partial pressure of hydrogen to 2.0 kg cm², and the polymerization time to 10 hours and omitting the use of 1 butene. Consequently, there was obtained 24.0 g of polyethylene powder having a bulk density of 0.38 g cm³ and a MI of 0.27 g 10 min Ec 73.6 g g cat hr atm and Et 1.77 kg g Ti hr atm . Polymerization of ethylene was carried out by following the procedure of Applied Example 13, except using the catalyst component obtained in Comparative Experiment 1 instead. Consequently, there was obtained polyethylene powder having a bulk density of 0.31 g cm³ and a MI of 0.22 g 10 min Ec was found to be 133 g g cat hr atm and Et to be 1.32 kg g Ti hr atm. In the autoclave having an inner volume of 1.5 liters and provided with a stirrer, a reaction mixture obtained by mixing 50.1 mg of the catalyst component obtained in Example 1, such an amount of n heptane solution of triethyl aluminum TEAL 1 mol liter that the amount of aluminum per gram atom of titanium in the catalyst composition equaled 200 gram atoms, and such an amount of a n heptane solution of phenyl triethoxy silane PES 0.1 mol liter that the amount of PES per gram atom of aluminum in the TEAL solution equaled 0.1 gram mol and retaining the resultant mixture for five minutes was placed under a blanket of nitrogen gas. Then 0.1 liter of hydrogen gas as a molecular weight adjusting agent and 1 liter of liquefied propylene were introduced under pressure. The reaction system so formed was heated to 70 C and held at that temperature for polymerization of propylene for one hour. After completion of the polymerization, the unaltered propylene was purged. Consequently, there was obtained 89.7 g of a white polypropylene powder having a HI of 93.2 and a MFR of 5.7 g 10 min Kc amount of polymer, g, formed per g of the catalyst component 1,790 and Kt amount of polymer, kg, formed per g of titanium in the catalyst component 43 . Polymerization of propylene was carried out by following the procedure of Applied Example 15, except using the catalyst components obtained in Example 9 and Comparative Experiment 1. The results are shown in Table III.
