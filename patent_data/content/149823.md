# Shell making method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming shells for use as can ends are disclosed. A sheet of thin metal is supplied to a first station 10 within a ram press, at which a generally circular blank is separated from the sheet and partially formed into the shell. The partially formed shell is transfer red from the first station 10 along a predetermined path to a second station within the same press by striking a blow edgewise of the shell and thereby directing it edgewise to the second station. The shell is captured and located at the second station, whereupon the shell is further formed to make the com pleted shell.
