# Revolving door systems.

## Abstract
A controller driven revolving door system has facing spaced apart curved panels 20, 22 partially enclosing three equiangularly spaced center shaft coupled wings 14 and defining entry 26 and exit 28 openings. The controller automatically selectively directs traffic flow through the entry and exit openings and is responsive to a microwave motion detector 60 at the entry and a mat switch in a quarter point position accessible to the exit. A DC motor 42 is coupled by a gearing assembly to the center shaft 37 . The controller monitors current passing through the motor windings sensing shaft rotation. Responsive to the mat switch, the controller applies a resistive load to the DC motor windings to regeneratively brake the rotation of the door. The controller thereafter reverses the polarity of the motor windings causing the door to rotate in a reverse direction and back any individual out of the exit area. Drum edge switches 62 on the curved panels sense interference with foreign objects to cause the controller to regeneratively brake, halting rotation of the center shaft. A handicapped person switch 58 is provided to reduce motor current and reduce shaft rotation speed.
