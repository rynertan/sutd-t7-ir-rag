# Attachment of skirt parts for surface effect vehicles.

## Abstract
To make a skirt part of a surface effect vehicle readily and reliably retainable to the vehicle while able to be folded to be sent to the position of use, the skirt part has an enlarged bead 12 to be slid into a restricted mouth channel 9 on the vehicle, the core 14 of the bead being an elongate spiral spring of stainless steel. End plugs 17,18 are fitted to prevent endwards escape from the channel.
