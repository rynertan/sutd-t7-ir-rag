# Tyre repair method.

## Abstract
A repair construction and method are disclosed for repairing a damaged portion in the wall 20 of a tire. A patch 44 is installed over the damaged portion on the inside of the tire, and the inside of the tire is pressurized 54 to force the patch into the damaged portion, preferably in a concave shape. The remainder of the plug area then is filled on the outside of the patch with a suitable plug material 50 , and the plug material and patch are then cured while the patch is maintained in position at least partially within the damaged portion. This construction and repair method eliminates bulging on the exterior of the tire after the repair is completed.
