# Positively driven steering member for conveying apparatus.

## Abstract
The positively driven steering member for conveying apparatus has a wheel 20 with a sphericaliy curved inner surface, a hub 10 with a spherically curved outer surface which fits inside of the wheel 20 , and a coupling which secures the wheel to the hub, permitting the axis of the wheel to be rotated relative to the axis of the hub in any direction while restraining relative motion between the wheel and hub about the axis of the hub. This arrangement provides that, when the hub 10 is driven by a shaft 14 passing through its axis, it drives the wheel, regardless of the angle between the hub and wheel.
