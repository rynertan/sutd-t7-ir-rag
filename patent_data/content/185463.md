# Continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A driveline for an engined vehicle, comprises a con tinuously variable ratio transmission 1 having an input adapted to be driven by the engine and an output 3 , a final drive shaft 8 for providing an output from the driveline, and means for driving the final drive shaft from the continuously variable ratio transmission in either high or low regime. In low regime the final drive shaft is driven by the output 7 of an epicyclic 4 having first and second inputs 6, 5 connected to be driven respectively by the said engine and by the said continuously variable ratio transmission output and in high regime the final drive shaft is driven directly by the output 3 of the continuously variable ratio transmis sion.
