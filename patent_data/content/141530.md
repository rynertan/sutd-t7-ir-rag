# Multiple fluid pathway energy converter.

## Abstract
An axial flow fan combining a shroud 12 defining a fluid pathway 34 coaxial with the shroud 12 , a motor 30 having a rotatable shaft 28 mounted within the fluid pathway 34 coaxial with the shroud 12 , an impeller 14 mounted to the shaft 28 with the impeller 14 having a hub 16 having a face 20 across the fluid pathway 34 and having an edge 24 at the radial perimeter of the hub 16 and having a plurality of blades 18 mounted radially to the edge 24 of the hub 16 and a set of guide vanes 32 disposed axially with respect to the impeller 14 and mounted within the fluid pathway 34 . The hub 16 has at least one face orifice 22 in the face 20 of the hub 16 communicating with at least one edge orifice 26 in the edge 24 of the hub 16 allowing fluid to flow through the hub, providing both axial fluid flow 36 and hub fluid flow 38 through the fan.
