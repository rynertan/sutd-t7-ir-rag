# The use of synthetic polymeric compositions as wallpaper adhesive.

## Abstract
A liquid polymeric composition comprises a suspen sion in an organic liquid of particulate water insoluble but water swellable polymer, the particles being less than 10 microns in size. To reduce viscosity in water the swellable polymer may be a copolymer and or a water soluble poly mer may be included. A composition of polymer particles that are swellabie and contain both soluble and insoluble polymer can be made by inverse emulsion polymerisation. An aqueous adhesive, that may be made by mixing this composition with water, comprises water swollen particu late polymer that may be a copolymer and that may be used with a dissolved polymer in order to reduce the visco sity. Pregummed substrates, such as wallpaper, that can be rendered adhesive by contacting with water are obtai ned by applying the aqueous or non aqueous composition to the substrate and drying it on the substrate. Wallcover ing can be stuck to a surface using the aqueous adhesive.
