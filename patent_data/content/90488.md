# APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY HEATING A PLURALITY OF ELONGATED WORKPIECES

## Abstract
A device for inductively heating simultaneously a plurality of identical elongated workpieces B each having at least two axially spaced portions to produce identical predetermined heat profiles in the workpiece throughout their longitudinal extents. The workpieces B are conveyed at a predetermined uniform speed along work paths P, P extending in a linear direction. A plurality of like multi turn induction heating coils 10, 12 are coaxially disposed along the work paths P, P and connected to a two level power source 32, 34 . A reciprocal stop D aligns the leading ends of the workpieces along the feed paths relative to the heat ing coils. The coils are at a first level of energization adap ted to inductively heat the first axial portion of the respective workpieces identically to the same predetermined tem perature as they pass through the coils. After a predeter mined time interval during the heating cycle, triggered by the action of the stop, the coils are automatically placed at the other level of energization to inductively heat the second axial portion of the respective workpieces identically.
