# FILTER CIRCUIT TUNABLE TO MICROWAVE FREQUENCY, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME

## Abstract
The specification relates to the circuitry of a filter tunable to microwave frequencies. The circuitry comprises two successive transverse branches of the same type, which are at each end connected to ground and each of which includes, connected in series, a fixed inductance L1 L2 , an adjustable inductance L4 L5 , a capacitance diode D1 D2 , and a high frequency by pass, in which case the capacitance diode D1 D2 is controlled by means of a DC signal and there is a coupling element, e.g. a series inductance L3 between the input point and output point of the filter. it is possible to cover the frequency range 950...1750 MHz by using economical Si capacitance diodes, by replacing the capacitor which serves in prior filters as a high frequeny by pass with a series resonance circuit, which preferably comprises a capacitance diode D3 D4 and an adjustable inductance L6 L7 . The implementation of the circuitry by using a two sided circuit card is also described.
