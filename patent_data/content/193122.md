# Method of preparing perfluoropolyethers having regulated molecular weight from theproduct obtained by photochemical oxidation of C2F4.

## Abstract
A method of preparing perfluoropolyethers having a reg ulated molecular weigh starting from the product obtained by photochemical oxidation of C₂F₄ and having a various con tent of oxygen peroxide, consisting in heat treating the per oxidized product in order to partially remove the oxygen per oxide till reducing it to a relatively low value which is prefixed as a function of the molecular weight to be obtained for the final product, and in the subsequent treatment with gaseous fluorine at high temperature.
