## Description
MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF A ROTATORY MOVEMENTINTO A STRAIGHT LINE MOVEMENT AND VICE VERSA.The invention refers to a mechanism intended to transform a rotatory movement into a straight line movement and vice versa and in particular to a device intended to motorise a mobile pumping unit of a compressor comprising a rod, the end of which is integral with a certain number of pistons the said rod moving in harmonic motion when the rotatory movement is uniform.Traditional mechanisms of the aforesaid type consist of a crank, a connecting rod and a piston to which the connecting rod is hinged and which moves on a rectilinear guide formed by the inner surface of a cylinder. The piston of these devices is generally subject to orthogonal stress with respect to the straight line path of its movement such stress involving specific pressure on the inner surface of the cylinder, which causes wear on both the piston skirt and the inner surface of the cylinder.More recent mechanisms have been designed in which the orthogonal stress, with repect to the piston path, is eliminated these consist of a crown gear, realised in the inner surface of a ring a pinion meshing with the said crown gear the pitch diameter of the crown has a double measurement with respect to the pitch diameter of the pinion, the axis of which is supported in rotation and in eccentric position with respect to the crown by a shaft coaxial to the axis of the crown the result being that the eccentricity is equal to the pitch radius of the pinion. The axis of the pinion is integral, with an eccentricity value the same as that already specified, with a pin which is in turn hinged to a rod, on a parallel axis to that of the pinion in the said mechanism, the rod moves in harmonic motion, pulling the aforesaid shaft in a uniform rotatory movement.All the known devices of the above mentioned type are difficult and costly to construct, since the components are not easily assembled to obtain the desired mechanism and since the said mechanism is of little functional use and is unreliable.This inventions is designed to remedy these problems.The invention, as characterised in the claims, solves the problem of creating a mechanism for the transformation of a rotatory movement into a straight line movement and vice versa, is easy to construct and assemble, very functional and reliable.The advantages obtained thanks to this invention consist of the fact that the assembly of the parts comprising the mechanism is simple, as is disassembly in the case of replacement of broken parts.The invention is explained below in greater detail, referring to the drawings which show two ways of carrying out the device. fig. 1 shows one way of carrying out the invention, in section according to the longitudinal axis of the device fig. 2 shows a second way of carrying out the invention, in section according to the longitudinal axis of the invention. With reference to fig. 1, the electric motor is indicated by no. 1 and the shaft, the rotor, the cooling fan, the stator and the casing of the said motor 1 are indicated respectively by nos. 2,3,4,5 and 6 the said casing 6 comprising a tubular extrusion extending beyond the rotor 3 and being clamped by means of stay rods not shown to the casing 22 of a compressor 5Q , which will be mentioned later.The part of the casing 6 protruding beyond the stator 5 has a fixed flange 7 which supports in rotation, by means of a bearing 8 , a cylindrical body 9 coaxial to the shaft 2 , to which it issmade integral either by material continuity or by a cone coupling indicated by dashed line a crown gear 10 , coaxial to the shaft 2 , is cut in the flange 7 in the opposite part to the housing for the bearing 8 .The cylindrical body 9 has an eccentric housing 30 which ends externally on one side corresponding to the head 9b of the said cylindrical body 9 and on the other side by means of a lateral window 31 .A shaft 12 , supported in rotation by the cylindrical body 9 by means of a pair of bearings 13 is positioned in the housing 30 the translation of the shaft 12 is prevented by piston rings 15,17 and by rings 35,36 .The shaft 12 is integral with a pinion 11 which partly protrudes from the cylindrical body 9 through the window 31 and engages itself with the said crown gear 10 . The head of the shaft 12 not concerned with the pinion 11 , is integral with a pin 19 mounted coaxially to the shaft 2 and hinged by means of rollers 20 with a rod 21 , the ends of which are integral with other pistons P shown by dashed lines in the drawings of the compressor 50 .The proportioning of the mechanism in question foresees that the pitch diameter of the crown 1Q is double that of the pitch diameter of the pinion 11 , that the eccentricity of the axis of the shaft 12 with respect to the axis of the shaft 2 is equal to the pitch radius of the pinion 11 and that the eccentricity of the axis of the pin 19 with respect to the axis of the shaft 12 is equal to the pitch radius of the pinion 113. Correct functioning of the mechanism shown in fig. 1 foresees the dynamic balancing of the cylindrical body 9 and of the organs connected to it, with respect to the axis of the shaft 2 . In these conditions, if the shaft 2 is rotated in a certain direction and at a certain speed, the shaft 12 turns in the opposite direction and at double the speed with respect to its own axis, a traverse follows, according to an alternate straight line movement of the pin 19 the movement of the pin becomes harmonic if the rotation of the shaft 2 takes place at a constant speedThe construction version shown in fig. 2 involves some construction parts which are basically the same as those described with reference to fig. 1 an electric motor 1 , a shaft 2 , a rotor 3 , aoooling fan 4 , a stator 5 and a casing 6. to house the motor 1 the said casing 6 being constructed from a tubular extrusion which extends beyond the rotor 3 and is clamped by stay rods not shown, to the casing 22 of a compressor 50 .The part of the casing 6 which protrudes beyond the stator 5 has a fixed flange 7 which supports in rotation, by means of a bearing 8 , a cylindrical body 9 coaxial to the shaft 2 , to which it is made integral either by material continuity or by a cone coupling, indicated by a dashed line.The cylindrical body 9 has a longitudinal housing 40 , eccentric with respect to the axis of the body 9 and terminating in the head 9b of the said body 9 bearings of a known type are positioned in the housing 40 and are intended to support in rotation a shaft 12 , fitted with a pinion 43 which partially protrudes from the same housing 4Q in correspondence with the head 9b . The extraction of the shaft 12 bearings 41 unit from the housing 40 is prevented by means of known organs indicated by 53 and 54. Between the head 9b of the cylindrical body 9 and the compressor 50 , a flange 45 is fitted which is clamped between the casings 6,22 by means of traditional construction devices, indicated by 26 the flange 45 has a crown gear 47 cut internally, on which the pinion 43 is engaged the head of the pinion 43 protrudes beyond the flange 45 on the side of the compressor 50 , in order to allow the clamping by the same, by means of screw organs 48 , of a pin 19 , mounted coaxially to the flange 15 .The pin 19 is hinged by means of rollers 20 to a rod 21 the ends of which are hinged to several pistons p shown by dashed lines in the drawings , which together with the relative cylinders and connected valves not illustrated comprise the pumping unit of this compressor.It should be pointed out that in order to transform the rotatory movement of the shaft 2 into alternate straight line movement of the rod 21 , the mechanism must satisfy the following requirements a the pitch diameter of the crown gear 47 is double the pitch diameter of the pinion 43 b the eccentricity of the axis of the shaft 12 with respect to the axis of the cylindrical body 9 is equal to the pitch radius of the pinion 43 .For correct functioning of the device shown in fig. 2, it is necessary for the moving parts of the same to be dynamically balanced with respect to the axis of the cylindrical body 9 for this reason , the cylindrical body 9 is fitted with an eccentric mass 9c , intended to dynamically balance the cylindrical body 9 shaft 12 and relative pinion 43 bearings 41 organs 53,54 unit,with respect to the axis of the cylindrical body 9 , while the pin 19 is equipped with an eccentric mass 1 9a intended to balance the pin 19 organ 48 unit with respect to the axis of the shaft 12 .So that the direction in which the rod 21 moves is the correct one, it is necessary to adjust the angular positioning of the pinion 43 with respect to the crown 47 it is therefore necessary to define the angular positioning of the flange 45 with respect to the casing 16 and this obtained through the use of appropriate connecting pins 40 The rotation in one direction of the shaft 2 of the motor 1 causes the rotation in the opposite direction and with double speed of the shaft 12 which rotates eccentrically with respect to the axis of the cylindrical body 9 and the consequent alternate straight line translation of the rod 21 , which becomes a harmonic movement when the rotation of the shaft 2 is uniform.In conclusion, it is necessary to describe the assembly of the device illustrated in fig. 1, which is carried out by proceeding as follows a connect the casing 6 to the stator 5 , with negative allowance h mount the flange 7 on the shaft 2 by means of the bearing 8 and mount the rotor 3 and relative fan 4 on the same shaft 2 c insert the shaft 12 in the housing 30 until the pinion 11 engages with the crown 1Q , so that the pin 19 is coaxial to the shaft 2 d the flange 7 is connected with the casing 6 so that the rotor 3 is positioned correctly with re spect to the relative stator 5 e the flange 7 is positioned angularly with respect to the casing 22 by means of pins 24 , integral with distance pieces 23 interspaced between the flange 7 and the casing 22 , mated with holes 24 a made in the parts concerned with this positioning and at the same time, the pin 19 is inserted inside the rollers 20 f the casing 6 is clamped with the casing 22 by means of stay rods not illustrated .
