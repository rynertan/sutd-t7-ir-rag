# TRIGGERING AND COOLING APPARATUS FOR LASER FLASHLAMPS

## Abstract
A triggering and cooling apparatus for a parallel triggered flashlamp, particularly useful in optically pumped lasers, ad vantageously provides support for the lamp allowing it to sur vive in harsh environments, while allowing for the handling of high electrical currents and providing a triggering arrangement in close proximity to but electrically isolated from the lamp electrodes. The apparatus includes an optically clear cylindrical outer envelope. First and second sleeves are provided which are secured respectively to the first and second electrodes of the lamp for locating the lamp concentrically and symmetrically within the cooling jacket. The first sleeve. which is adjacent the end of the lamp wherein the parallel trigger electrode enters, is fitted within a non electrically conductive member which in turns is tightly fitted within the cooling jacket. A pair of end members are provided for sealing the ends of the cooling jacket to produce a coolant chamber for receiving a flow of liquid coolant, the end members being provided with means for in troducing to the lamp electrodes operating potentials as well as means for introducing to the trigger electrode a triggering voltage for starting the flashlamp.
