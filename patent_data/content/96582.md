# COMPOSITE CLOSURE

## Abstract
This relates to a closure for containers wherein there is a relative twisting or rotation of the closure with respect to the container neck finish in the application and removal of the closure. In order to reduce the torque required in the removal of the closure and also to eliminate the lubricant customarily incorporated in the gasket material of the closure, the closure is of a composite construction including a ring member and a closure panel, with the ring member being so constructed as to provide for limited relative axial movement between the closure panel and the ring member. Thus, when a closure is to be removed, the initial removal torque is very low in that it is only necessary to rotate the ring member relative to the container and there is no axial force required to break the seal between the gasket material and the container neck finish. After an initial relative axial movement between the ring member and the closure panel and at a time when the ring member has mementum, the ring member engages the closure panel and moves the same axially to break the seal between the closure panel and the container with a minimal additional torque being required. This abstract forms no part of the specification of this application and is not to be construed as limiting the claims of the application.
