# A drill boom arrangement.

## Abstract
A drill boom arrangement comprises a boom proper that is universally pivotably carried by a boom support. The boom carries a feed beam for a rock drill. The boom is swingable on the support by means of two hydraulic cylinders forming a tripod and the feed beam is swingable on the boom by means of two hydraulic cylinders forming another tripod. One of the boom swinging cylinders 17 is coupled in series with one of the feed beam swinging cylinders 28 and these two cylinders are actuated by means of a common direction control valve 58 . The boom swinging cylinder 17 can be short circuited so that the feed beam can be swung upon actuation of the direction control valve 58 while the boom is arrested. The other boom swinging cylinder 16 is coupled in series with the other feed beam swinging cylinder 29 to a common direction control valve 57 in the same way. A joy stick 59 is coupled to the two direction control valves 57, 58 through pilot valves and pilot lines 64 67 .
