## Description
ISLAND RECORD FILMS FABRICATION The present invention relates to novel thin film structures and more particularly to such films of metal rendered in semicontinuous, island form.INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND This is a Continuation in part of my copending application USSN 381694 for Insular Record Films forDigital Data Storage , filed May 1982, which, by this reference, will be understood as incorporated herein to the extent consistent herewith. Workers in the art of making,and using very thin metal films for recording e.g., order of afew AO to a few hundred AO are typically interested. in making those as continuous as possible, with little or no void area. By contrast, this invention concerns itself with intentionally rendering thin films to be semi continuous, in island insular form. It has been found, and is here explained, that such insular films may be laid down e.g., vacuum deposited so as to exhibit a fairly uniform pattern of islands and void intervals, with fairly uniform island size and thickness doing so with techniques that are rather precisely controllable and repeatable, and are relatively straight forward and inexpensive e.g., using a known type of vacuum deposition . According to a related feature, it has been found that such insular films exhibit some advantageous, unexpected properties and characteristics. For instance, when a metal like gold is so deposited as islands , the insular film appears to exhibit some properties which are quite a bit different from those of the bulk metal e.g., melting at a much lower temperature , and as spelled out in great detail in my cited USSN 381694 insular films can be quite advantageously adapted for an optical laser record. Thus, most of the following description of the fabrication and use of exemplary insular films is cast in terms of optical disk records, apt for digital laser recording, though workers will contemplate other, quite different applications. Thus, it is an object hereof to provide the foregoing, and other related, features and advantages.A more particular object is to do so, teaching the deposition of gold and like films in island or like discontinuous form. Another object is to teach such films exhibiting good heat response, as well as extended service life. A further object is to teach a preferred way of preparing such films.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated by workers as they become better understood by reference to the following detailed description of some presently preferred embodiments, these being considered in conjunction with accompanying drawings, wherein like reference symbols denote like elements FIGS. 1 13 are the same as in my cited USSN 381694, the description of which has been incorporated herein by reference, except to the extent inconsistent herewith, this description not being reproduced here in full, in the interests of brevity.

Such OR records will be understood as rendered on an anti reflective base, cf., preferably as part of a trilayer as discussed in USSN 381694 and references therein . How such a trilayer has heretofore been employed in media using ablative absorber films, or other such known deformational information structures, will next be discussed. Disruptive Deformational information structures using trilayer According to one known approach see article byA. E. Bell and F. W. Spong, IEEE J. Quantum Electron., QEl4, 487 1978 , trilayer optical data storage media utilize a rigid substrate upon which is deposited, in order an opaque metallic reflector layer, a dielectric spacer, and a thin absorber or information layer, typically comprised of a low melting point metal . The thickness of the dielectric spacer is chosen such that the information layer is at the peak of the standing wave of the optical electric field upon exposure to a focused beam of laser radiation.As the incident radiation is absorbed in a write site of the information layer, the temperature of this site rises until a physical disruption or deformation of the information layer occurs. This disruption, or deformation at the write site, exposes the underlying reflector, resulting in a large and irreversible increase of reflectance, and so creating a written bit . With conventional trilayer media, such deformation disruption of the information layer during a laser write event may be understood as following one of three mechanisms, as follows 1 The information layer may undergo local ablation with material being ejected from the bit site or 2 The absorber may undergo local melting, with disruption of the molten metal due to surface tension effects, resulting in a rim of solidified material about the circumference of the bit site or 3 The material of the spacer layer may be chosen such that heat conducted to this layer from the information layer causes local decomposition and gas evolution in the spacer. The expanding gas causes a slight deformation of the information layer, and the bit site takes the form of a hemispheric bubble. These three bit forming processes may be understood, respectively, as ablation , rim formation , and bubble formation all being disruptive and or deformational. That is, those bit formation mechanisms involve some significant deformation and or disruption , i.e., either a volume change of significant proportions, or mass transport of debris over distances that are large with respect to the radius of the bit site. As a consequence, all these mechanisms reviewed as inherently incompatible with the usual presence of massive conventional in contact overcoat. This has given rise to some complex overcoat configurations designed to accommodate these gross physical movements involved in such bit formation e.g., air gaps and other non contact design approaches. From the standpoint of simplicity, durability, and cost of fabrication, the use of an in contact over coat is attractive and advantageous. For the concept of an in contact overcoat to be feasible in practice, however, the bit formation mechanism must proceed without the need for deformation or disruption , i.e., with out gross motion or mass transport over distances that are a significant fraction of the bit radius. Novel island information structures not disruptive deformational The development of trilayer optical data storage media compatible with an in contact overcoat is here treated. Such media will be seen to use a conventional metallic reflector and dielectric spacer configuration, but the information layer will constitute a thin, discon tinuous gold island film , representing a significant departure from known approaches. The use of an island film as the information layer gives rise to a unique recording bit forming mechanism agglomeration that appears capable of being relatively unaffected by the presence of a massive, in contact overcoat, especially one having a rough fissured contact face. The following describes how island films are made and used, and includes details of this agglomeration mechanism in trilayer media incorporating island gold as the information layer. A phenomenological model is presented to explain observed behavior, describing agglomeration and how it functions in the presence of an incontact overcoat. EXAMPLES The following Examples are given by way of teach ing some exemplary concepts, uses, and advantages of such island film absorbers and associated writing by agglomeration therewith, according to the invention to some extent duplicating, as well as supplementing, details ofUSSN 381694. Advantages and features of the island films will be better appreciated by comparing them with deformational absorbers known in the art and described in USSN 381694, such as the Te Example Tellurium . Example I absorber of gold material FIG. 2 The operations, material, methods and structure of the Te Example FIG. 1 described in USSN 381694 are followed here, except as otherwise specified, in a novel record 10 FIG. 2 havinQa gold absorber film 15 replacing the tellurium absorber film 5 in FIG. 1 . Record 10 will be understood as comprising a support 12 on which an anti reflective base 1 AR is laid like AR in FIG. 1 , preferably comprising a dielectric spacer 14 on an opaque metallic reflective layer 13, with absorber film 15 placed atop spacer 14. Here, and according to a salient feature hereof, absorber 15 comprises a very thin minimum mass film of gold material laid down in an island layer configuration and intended to function as an absorber film cf., the Te film in the Te Example e.g., apt for somewhat similar recording methods and with similar means . Here, very close attention is paid, during deposition, to controlling absorber thickness so that mass is minimized, island uniformity maximized e.g., monitoring to yield a prescribed minimal Dark Mirror reflectance X e.g., here, 10 is suitable as further described below.It is vital of course that film 15 be laid down to be semicontinuous discontinuous , being formed in a highly uniform island configuration e.g., roughly exemplified in FIG. 11, a 100,000 x TEM, or Transmission Electromicrograph, and as further described below. The underlying spacer layer 14, reflector layer 13 and substrate 12 are at least functionally otherwise the same as in Te Example , and thus will be understood as functioning as a trilayer with absorber 15 as understood in the art e.g., see cited references in USSN 381694 Gold island absorber film 15 may preferably be formed by vapor depositing gold onto the surface of dielectric spacer 4 until monitoring the well known trilayer effect surface reflectivity of 15 first drops to preselected value Rm 10 reflectance, here , taking care to render the required insular islands configuration.Reflectance Rm may, conveniently, be set at any desired value consistent with adequate writing and readout. Here, an Rm of about 10 is arbitrarily selected minimum for proper focusing, etc, of this laser . Then, somewhat surprising to discover, writing on this island film with a prescribed laser beam as in Te Example ofUSSN 381694 can shift reflectance enough to give good read out in the described manner. That is, a written spot may be seen to exhibit 22 55 reflectance, yielding desired S N in the 25 40 dB range in some cases a 30 50 increase is satisfactory Workers will appreciate how other minimum reflectance values may be chosen for the virgin unwritten absorber film. Preparation details re absorber layer 15 FIG. 2 Absorber layer 15 thus comprises an extremely 25 thin, highly uniform, minimum mass, island deposit of gold which is vapor deposited thermally evaporated or sputtered onto spacer layer 14 i.e., on a relatively flat e.g., 0.5 X record surface thereof .Somewhat unexpectedly, one finds that if gold is so deposited on such a trilayer only until a prescribed minimum reflectance Rm e.g., 10 , the islands are formed such that, when subjected to the described laser write beam 6338 AO, 10 mW for 40 n. sec., etc. , reflectance quite desirably, yet wholly unexpectedly changes significantly quite enough for adequate read out. e.g., pure gold may be so deposited in large vacuum chamber at 10 6 7 in large vacuum chamber at 10 6 10 Torr., from a molybdenum boat which is resistance heated deposition rate being about 5 10 A sec. All substrates are cleaned according to present good practice for optical thin films. A light silica strike alternatively Mg.Fl., or the like may be likewise vapor deposited on spacer 14 as a nucleation strike before the gold island film 15 is deposited. The strike should, in optimized instances, induce minimum mass, minimum size islands uniformly across the spacer. It is important that this deposition by thermal evaporation cease once the reflectance of film 15 first attains the predetermined minimum mass minimum reflectance level Rm yielding the desired islands otherwise the contemplated islands and associated results may not be produced. As workers know, such deposition may be programmed empirically, or by continually monitoring the surfacereflectance of a witness chip while absorber film 15 is deposited until satisfactory islands begin to appear and see somewhat related deposition approach of Zech in his cited article, in USSN 381694, or refer to other known methods, such as monitoring deposited mass or electrical properties during deposition . Results of EX. I The results laser recording on this island configuration are most surprising, especially in light of expected properties and as compared with conventional media like the known Te absorber films e.g., prepared as above described in the Te Example of USSN 381694 .That is, record 10 will be understood as recorded upon, read out and evaluated, with its sensitivity, etc., measured, as in the cited Te Example of USSN 381694 e.g., using an He Ne laser system of the type mentioned . ThQ so written bit sites will exhibit the mentioned agglomeration where absorber islands at a write site have been made to form spheres, and these spheres coalesce when heated by the write energy this across a write site diameter comparable to the diameter of the write beam e.g., 1 4 3 4 thereof . This agglomeration is seen to be accompanied by an associated increase in reflectance and read out signal. FIG. 6 is an artistic rendering showing such a very crude form of an agglomerate hole written bit based on photomicrographs of such records. Here an agglomerate hole 15p will be understood as a somewhatcircular written spot, or physical optical discontinuity in the virgin unwritten absorber island film 15v.The size of spot 15 may be on the order of laser writebeam diameter e.g., 40 120 thereof . Within the spot 15pw the same amount of absorber material is present, but the write beam has agglomerated consolidated tiny islands into absorber globs gL, most of which are relatively larger and usually fewer than the tiny islands of virgin film 15v and FIG. 11, and lying relatively farther apart once so written . In effect, spots 15p will be understood as constituting an optical discontinuity at the selected readwavelength Aw whereas the physically discontinuous virgin is1and film 15v appears relatively continuous optically and a partial reflector. Workers will appreciate how such non deformational Åagglomeration holes 15p can be the fun6tional equivalent of conventional deformational pits like those known with tellurium see Te Ex. and references cited in USSN 381694 . As detailed below, one finds that such an insular absorber film can yield a superior record one giving considerable archival stability, unexpectedlyhigh sensitivity and high S N, while requiring surprisingly low write energy, and low write temperature evidently and also apparently having good tolerance to an overcoat.For instance, where, for an island absorber, a useful overcoat need not degrade operational performance beyond practical usefulness as presently happens with Te and other deformational absorbers, perhaps because these evidently require a relatively massive translation deformation of absorber material in contradistinction, workers will be pleasantly surprised to note that the invention can record i.e., open a bit hole to pass the Read beam without need for such extensive translating and or deforming of the absorber in the bit site instead the invention can operate by merely agglomerating , and thus redistributing absorber within the bit site, with relatively little or no material necessarily moved extensively across, or outside the site, or ablation ejected therebeyond, etc.Details are given below. Island form of absorber film FIG. 11 is a microscopic plan view 100,000 x TE micrograph of the original, virgin i.e., unrecordedupon reflecting surface of a gold island absorber film like that above described. It will be evident that this surface appears as a physically, semi continuous, or partly discontinuous, insular configuration, exhibiting a fairly regular island pattern on an SiO2 spacersurface . For this EX. I, the unwritten islands will be understood as having diameters on the order of a few hundred AO e.g., 100 300 AO typical , separated by intervals of comparable dimension e.g., 50 200 AO apart vs. laser beam 5000 10,000 AO wide cf 6328 A0 wavelength .The virgin film 15 will thus exhibit a certain void range e.g., a few to 40 voids . Now, subjecting a portion of this virgin film to a laser recording beam as described acts to so agglomerate these islands , increasing the percent void in the site larger island spacing thus forming an agglomerate hole as in FIG. 6, this process being, here, loosely characterized as agglomeration . This island configuration was not expected yet more surprising were the unusual recording properties realized such as agglomeration effects which were quite different from any other recording films and from what the properties of bulk gold would indicate As mentioned above, forming ODD absorber films or any media structure to exhibit an island configuration is unmentioned in the literature moreover it seems to be contrary to present good practice e.g., as U.S. 4,222,071 makes clear see discussion in USSN 381694 . At least some of the first order factors controlling such island formation are believed to be absorber material, deposition rate, adhesion substrate material and condition e.g., cleaning, roughness, strike film as nucleation surface and temperature presence of vapor contaminants vacuum pressure and like factors as will be appreciated by workers. For example, too cool a substrate will render a continuous film, too hot will leave no film at all. In this regard workers may compare FIGS. 12 and 13 with FIG. 11.For FIG. 12, a similar film was prepared like EX. I except that a silica spacer was coated with a bismuth oxide layer a nucleation aid known in the art . For the FIG. 13 case, a chromium nucleation layer was used. Compared withFIG. 11, the FIG. 12 seemed to exhibit thinner islands, farther apart, while FIG. 13 is a continuous gold film no islands . The cited laser apparatus could not write at all on the film of FIG. 13 at cited power level while the film of FIG. 12 wrote generally as in FIG. 11 EX. I except for a bit lower sensitivity. Workers will now appreciate that such an island absorber can render certain desired results taking into account such factors as read write conditions e.g., writeenergy, beam width, X, etc. . Thus, in EX. I satisfactory bit holes about 4000 to 10,000 AO diameter were formed with the specified write beam, etc. gave satisfactory S N, etc. . As further detailed below, agglomeration for prescribed write read conditions seems to require not only a satisfactory virgin island film, but depends at least to some extent on island temperature and mobility during writing i.e., on the maximum temperature reached by melting islands and their associated mobility during the agglomeration phase these, in turn, depending on virgin island size and interfacial energy of melting islands in contact with the host surface s . Desired virgin island pattern One infers that island diameters or separation which are too large or too small will not be satisfactory.More particularly, it seems that the virgin size and spacing of the islands should be such as to accommodate a desired agglomeration, upon recording, with average island diameter well below anything approaching a continuous film i.e., sufficient spacing and percent void to thermally isolate individual islands yet large enough void low enough so that absorber film 15 appears like a relatively continuous optical reflector at selected X R W lasers .And spacing is presumably large enough so that when a spot is laser heated written upon it will so agglomerate to a significant, detectible extent and form the indicated agglomerate hole , causing the film 15 to optically switch and exhibit a significant shift in detected reflectance consistent with required S N, etc. i.e., so the spot becomes relatively transparent now and appears relatively open and transparent to the optical system concerned, somewhat like a conventional pit . Desired agglomeration Stated otherwise, the write beam is assumed, here, to so affect the islands in a bit site as to cause agglomeration , with attendant sphericizati6n and increase in average island size and spacing increased void area .One infers that the initial virgin void will be sufficient to accommodate a prescribed minimal heatAoss, radially, yet not so large that initial reflectance Ro exceeds the desired near zero value required for a Dark Mirror workers will note that so opening the absorber in a trilayer gives an effective increase in reflectivity e.g., as here, from about 10 to about 30 . In general, one may describe this writing operation as so energizing the absorber island film as to, in effect, significantly redistribute absorber mass at the bit site yet not to the extent exhibited by disruptional deformational non insular or continuous films Thus where an unwritten island site absorber film only may exhibit 25 absorption 45 transmission 30 reflection, the so written film site may shift these values to about 10 70 20 , respectively, for the subject write wavelength whereas the overall trilayer values would shift from 90 0 10 to 40 50 0 60 50 . As this writing so increases the percent void area , one infers that the write beam evidently so energizes the islands at a write site that their average size increases and their average spacing increases i.e., they agglomerate to a written pattern of fewer islands . Island films as such Now, thin metallic films in island form have received some attention in the literature as a general proposition i.e., entirely apart from record media applications e.g., see article with this title byDoremus in J. App. Physics June 66, Vol. 37, num 7, pp 2775 et sequ. where gold films were described also see Optical Constants of Aggregated Gold Film by Truong, et al. in J.Optical Society Am., Vol. 66, num 2, February 1976, pp 124 et sequ. where such films were formed by evaporating onto hot glass substrates at 300 C, and wherein the authors opine it is reasonable to assume that the particles themselves have the bulk optical constants of their native material also see Structural and Electrical Properties of Discontinuous Gold Films onGlass by Andersson and Norman in Vacuum , Vol. 27, num 4, 1977, Pergamon Press, Great Britain studying electrical resistance of such films, indicating that this resistance exceeds that of the bu k gold . Yet no worker appears to have discovered, or even suggested, that there is any advantage to using any such island films in a recording medium, whether of gold or any other metal. Indeed, workers appear to have contemplated only continuous absorber films for media e.g., see cited U.S. 4,222,071 specifying that the absorber should not be agglomerated but should be a continuous film or see IBM TDB of March 71, p. 3001, teaching a continuous metal layer such as gold plus an amorphous sub layer like amorphous silicon these layers to be heated to form a mixture of gold, crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon , etc. . It was quite accidental and fortuitous thatI happened to so render such a minimum reflectance insular deposition onto a trilayer structure . OtherwiseI cannot have expected to provide such ODD records exhibiting satisfactory sensitivity and S N over a long service life see below . Now, as mentioned, such island absorber films seem rather strikingly and unusually affected by a relatively low energy write pulse so that, without evidently being heated to gold s published melting point, the virgin island masses are nonetheless redistributed agglomerated . This is not predicted by the literature On the contrary, many workers have assumed that thin metal films would exhibit the properties of the bulk metal. A few have differed, opining that some properties none related to recording though may differ. Thus, a worker just could not be sure how such an island absorber film would perform in an OD disk context like that here described . Workers will recognize how surprising it is that such island films can be laser written so as to generate such agglomerated holes . One might, rather, expect that absorber film continuity was needed to spread the laser softened material at the write site e.g., pull apart the pit site, as the cited Zech article postulates, stating that surface tension causes a transverse cavitation , etc. . Workers will welcome a system whereby bits can be radiation recorded without the intense heat and macroscopic changes implicit in the well known gross melting ablating of a deformational absorber film as with a Te absorber in the cited Te Example , and without need for any such massive translation of absorber material . Overcoating effects EX. I A The cited Te Example is also run with a thin overcoating of SiO 100 AO, vapor deposited on the continuous Te absorber film. This simulates an overcoat, but does not afford a true, full functional overcoat of the kind workers typically postulate like several mils of a transparent polymer to permit record handling without scratching, to defocus surface dust, grime, etc. to impede vapor entry, e.g. of water, oxygen.But this light SiO coat will nonetheless affect Te pit formation , raising required write energy to about double. Possibly because it so restricts the Te film at the pit site as to impede associated displacement of Te material there . Workers have expected that such deformationaldisruptive recording as with pits in Te, bubbles in other metals, etc. would be resisted by any overcoat e.g., read out signal destroyed sensitivity raised the overcoat impeding, if not prohibiting, absorber translation, deformation and or expulsion from the bitsite, and barring any ejecta of course . Significantly however, when a gold island film like those here described is similarly over coated herewith EX. I A , little or no such resistance is evident and sensitivity is only slightly degraded if at all further evidence that a different type of bitforming mechanism is at work. Although, as detailed below, such an absorber coating SiO2 is disfavored in favor of a more fissured coating like the described modified fluoro polymer . As workers will agree, this reinforces the theory that the instant recording mechanism is quite novel evidently whatever deformation and or movement of the island mass accompanies such low power writing of a bit , it is better tolerated by an overcoat, i.e., the overcoat presents less resistance to the bit forming mechanism this being consistent with the described agglomeration .This amplifies the attractiveness of such insular absorbers, since tolerance to overcoating is very, very important. Absence of Bulk Au properties As another feature hereof, and based on the foregoing Example I, and others, one would infer that such an island film absorber of gold is not behaving as would be predicted from its reported Bulk gold properties e.g., radial conduction of heat is not likely to be significant . The discovery of such characteristics of insular films and associated uses, is significant and is further discussed below. It would appear that these agglomerate holes reflectivity switched are formed at temperatures wellbelow the absorber s melting temperature of bulk gold , that they involve little or no absorber expulsion and that so writing on them and agglomerating them requires much less write energy. In general, workers may expect that such insular absorber films can be used to make OD disks as contemplated e.g., satisfying all or most of the usual requirements of such see also USSN 381694 . TE Micrographs FIGS. 14 21 Here, the transmission electron microscope TEM is utilized as a major analytical technique to study the morphology, and elucidate the mechanism, of bit formation in trilayer media with island gold as the information layer. This is an especially powerful technique when combined with a media performance diagnostic such as a laser read write system, because it allows the direct correlation of media performance parameters, such as read signal amplitude and signal to noise ratio, with actual data bit morphologies as observed in the TEM. For the examples of FIGS. 14 21, trilayer optical recording exemplars for TEM examination are deposited upon carbon pre coated 200 mesh copper grids. The coatings consist of an aluminum reflector, dielectric spacer layer, and a gold absorber layer. An electron transparent overcoat is also applied in select cases. Laser writing on such TEM specimens is carried out using a read write system incorporating a modulated helium neon laser. Read write wavelength is 632.8 nm.A lens with .65 numerical aperture is used and the spot size is 0.8 micron. Prior to TEM examination, data bits written on the TEM specimens are located using an optical microscope. This facilitates subsequent location of the written bits in the TEM. TEM examination is carried out using a ZeissEM 109 electron microscope operated at 10Q kilovolts. Specimen damage due to electron beam heating effects is not a problem during routine examination. With extremely high electron beam current density, however, in situ morphological changes in the island gold films can be initiated these are helpful in understanding the phenomenology of heating effects in these films. EX. II A gold island film is deposited on a dielectric spacer layer e.g., as in EX. I, but omitting the reflector layer, using carbon coated copper grid as substrate as above noted . Results FIG. 14 FIG. 14 shows the so deposited virgin unwritten island film. Here the reflector layer is not present in order to simplify the examination of the morphology of the as deposited gold. The result is seen in FIG. 14, a bright field micrograph. The gold film evidently consists of irregularly shaped islands with an areal coverage of approximately 60 percent. Many of the islands are long and narrow in shape, while some others are roughly circular. Average island spacing is on the order of 100 AO 1 x 10 2 cm . The use of an island metal film as the information layer in the trilayer optical storage medium is attractive for two reasons. First, the discontinuous structure of the film tends to minimize radial thermal losses during the write pulse. Second, long range surface tension forces, characteristic of media in which rim formation predominates, are absent. Fissured contact face Here, and elsewhere, it will also be understood that the contact face of the fluoro polymer overcoat and, possibly, the under layer spacer , facing the gold islands, is in some sense fissured , or covered with channels disposed and dimensioned to allow a great deal of mobility to the melting islands so they may readily agglomerate . Non fissured contact faces e.g., of SiO2 presumably inhibit such mobility. EX. III EX. II is replicated, except that a full trilayer with reflector on fluoro polymer spacer is produced also light overcoating of fluoro polymer face fissured is overlaid on the gold island absorber. Further, a lightSiO2 strike is applied on the spacer to better nucleate gold isles. Then a bit is laser recorded at a bit site on this structure 10 mW, 40 ns pulse from He Ne laser operated at 632.8 nm . Results FIG. 15 FIG. 15, a micrograph of the so written trilayer medium, with overcoat, demonstrates agglomeration. Here, written data bit is visible in the central portion of the micrograph, while outside the written data bit, the original virgin island structure, similar to that shown in FIG. 14, is visible. Note that the presence of the aluminum reflector layer adds an additional degree of complexity to the interpretation of this micrograph. This layer is polycrystalline with random crystal orientation. In the TEM, aluminum crystals suitably oriented for Bragg diffraction i.e., in contrast will appear as dark areas, while other crystals, not suitably oriented, will be invisible. In the micrographs shown here, aluminum crystals in the reflector layer which are in contrast appear as dark areas approximately 0.1 to 0.4 microns in diameter. It will be clear from the FIG. 15 micrograph that the laser write event has caused a marked change in the morphology of the island gold information layer.The original, irregularly shaped islands have been replaced by a distribution of spherical particles whose number density is substantially less than that of the initial island configuration. The sphericity of the particles in the written area implies that melting has occurred , while the reduced number density of particles indicates that agglomeration or coalescence of molten particles has taken place. It is important to note that the change in reflectance of the trilayer medium associated with this melting and agglomeration process is quite substantial.The original trilayer, with reflectance of 10 at 632.8 nm, increases reflectance after writing, to 50 at the same wavelength. The signal to peak rms noise ratio, typical of written data with the bit morphology of FIG. 15, is 30 dB over a 20 mHz bandwidth. Thus, while there are optical losses associated with the bit morphology shown in FIG. 15, they do not seriously degrade the optical performance of the medium. Note absence of a thick, full overcoat here is understood to enhance read out, but only slightly e.g., vs. read out with full overcoat as with FIG. 2, etc. and, vs.un overcoated state output is degraded by about one half with smaller, less massive virgin isles one may expect to improve sensitivity, readout, etc., as explained below. EX. III A FIG. 16 EX.III is replicated with bits written same laser energy along a number of tracks . Results appear in FIG. 16 TEM like FIG. 15, but lower magnification, and showing several tracks aligned written bits running vertically being spread about 1.2 microns apart. Otherwise, this is essentially as in EX. III. EX. III B FIG. 17 EX. III is, again, replicated except that writing is conducted at much reduced laser energy up to about 1 10 1 20 that of FIGS. 15, 16 more analogous to threshold power . Results FIG. 17 indicates the incipient or threshold agglomeration implicit in such under power writing e.g., bit formation presaging that of FIGS. 15, 16 . That is, here, it appears that the very low power laser pulse has brought about some change in island shape due to melting, with some spherical particles in evidence, but the agglomeration process has not gone to completion.Increased write power will presumably give agglomeration more like that of FIGS. 15, 16. Bit forming via agglomeration The foregoing micrographs FIGS. 14 17 demonstrate a bit formation process which is essentially one of melting and agglomeration of the island gold film to form a distribution of spherical debris particles. The final size and arrangement of the debris particles should be functions of the maximum temperature which is reached by the molten islands, and of the mobility of the islands during the agglomeration phase. As the island gold film is exposed to the write pulse of the laser, the temperature of the islands rises due to the enhanced absorption inherent to the trilayer structure. At some point in time a melting event occurs which is accompanied by a change in shape of the islands.This shape change, exemplified by the micrograph of FIG. 17, is driven by the increase in interfacial energy for the now molten gold at the spacer and overcoat interfaces. A consequence of the shape change is the initiation of a detuning of the optical absorption of the trilayer, which is accompanied by a decrease in the rate of temperature rise. The temperature at which the melting event occurs is thought to be in the range of 3000C. to 6000C., well below the bulk melting temperature of gold. High Threshold media Big globs high noise Here, assume Sample EX. IV, same as for FIG. 15 except that nucleation strike is tin. The minimum laser write power necessary to bring the island gold to the critical temperature required for melting, with the shape change and trilayer detung which accompany it, may be understood as the threshold power for a given medium. For media which have a high threshold power, isIand temperatures are high prior to the initiation of melting and detuning of the trilayer. An example,EX. IV, of bit formation in such a medium is shown in FIG. 18, which is a TEM micrograph of a trilayer with an island gold information layer, written with a 10 mW, 40 ns laser pulse. Here, as a consequence of the high temperature attained prior to melting, island mobility has been enhanced and the agglomeration process prolonged.This has resulted in the distribution of extremely large spherical particles visible in the written bit. In this example, there is also a marked tendency for the spherical particles to migrate toward the edge of the written area. This effect is a consequence of the radial thermal gradient imposed by theGaussian write pulse. The particles thus tend to move down the thermal gradient to the cooler regions at the edge of the bit. From the standpoint of media performance, the bit morphology shown in FIG. 18 is undesirable, as the non uniform distribution of extremely large debris particles Big Globs reduces peak to peak signal to noise ratio. Note The FIG. 18 sample, or EX. IV, may be understood as essentially the same as that of FIG. 15, except that a tin strike is substituted for the SiO2 strike thus, in light of the indicated Massive agglomeration of FIG. 18, with fewer, larger globs, non uniformly distributed by same write energy , one might characterize a Sn strike, or nucleating film, as high threshold high noise where the SiO2 strike could be characterized as low threshold low noise for such gold absorbers see further below. Also, where such Massive agglomeration mobility is presumably inhibited by the subject contact faces e.g., channels in fluoro polymer overcoat evidently don t freely pass these , one will assume that other, more widely fissured contact faces will inhibit it less cf. improvement feature . Low Threshold media Tiny globs low noise Here, assume EX. V FIG. 19 , same as for FIG. 15 except spacer is another modified fluoro polymer and has no nucleation film thereon. In cases where the threshold is very low, island temperatures at the onset of melting and trilayer detuning are low, and the island agglomeration process is curtailed poor agglomeration, more globs, very small . An example EX. V of bit formation in a medium which exhibits this behavior is shown in FIG. 19. In this island gold trilayer medium, written with a 10 mw, 40 ns laser pulse, the areal density of debris particles in the data bit is only slightly lower than the areal density of gold islands in the unwritten regions. Thus, while the islands have melted and reverted to tiny spheres, effectively detuning the trilayer, the low temperatures involved have inhibited the island agglomeration process. The resulting data bit is, in fact, rather difficult to see center of FIG. 19 with the eye.This uniform distribution of very small spherical particles, however, results in a high signal tonoise ratio, typically exceeding 30 dB. A characteristic of media with low thresholds is increased bit diameter for a given write power, as compared to media with high thresholds. Due to their lower temperature for melting and optical detuning of the trilayer, low threshold media more effectively utilize the outer, lower power regions of the incident Gaussian beam. Thus, EX. V FIG. 19 may be characterized as Low Threshold low noise , yet still lacking in full complete agglomeration. Of course, more complete agglomeration will yield increased reflectance shift AR and thus usually be desired. Effect of an In Contact Overcoat As mentioned earlier, trilayer bit formation mechanisms which involve gross motion, as in rim formation or bubble formation, are inherently incompatibl,e with the presence of a massive, in contact overcoat. Even in cases where the mechanical properties of the overcoat material are tailored to minimize constraining effects upon the bit formation mechanism, the degradation in performance after overcoating is substantial. In contrast, the bit formation mechanism described above, for island gold media, does not involve mass transport over long distances. It involves localized rearrangements of the gold islands which do not necessitate large displacements of adjacent surfaces. As the gold islands cover only approximately 60 percent of the available area, ample space exists to accommodate this rearrangement. Of course, there must be limits to the extent to which the agglomeration process can proceed without being affected by a massive overcoat. The bit morphology shown in FIG. 18, for example, involves the formation and motion of very large particles, and cannot proceed unimpeded in the presence of the usual in contact overcoat. EX. VI medium writing unaffected by overcoat EX. II is replicated, except that the SiO2 strike on the spacer nucleating strike is replaced by another, low threshold material, but one fostering better, more complete agglomeration and inducing smaller, reducedmass virgin islands and processed accordingly. Writing is conducted as in EX. II, etc. Results FIGS. 20, 21 In this sample, optimal virgin island deposition is achieved as well as optimal bit formation agglomeration, with low threshold . More particularly, island deposition evidently see TEM FIG. 20, showing an as written bit magnified 2 x in FIG. 21 yields the smallest islands least mass, smallest diameter on the average, of all Examples herein.This evidently due in part, at least to the superior nucleation film used. And, as FIG. 20 indicates, this sample yields superior agglomeration and other writing effects bitformation e.g., vs. samples of FIG. 15, or FIG. 19, etc., when similarly written upon . Surprisingly, bit formation agglomeration in this sample medium manifests no degradation in the presence of a massive, in contact overcoat as shown in FIG. 20 something astonishing to workers in this art In this sample, the diameter of the as deposited virgin gold islands is extremely small, averaging approximately 80 AO. The data bit FIG. 20, center , written with a 10 mW, 40 ns laser pulse, exhibits a highly uniform distribution of spherical debris particles.Incipient melting and agglomeration effects, visible at the edge of the written bit, delineate a threshold region . FIGURE 21 FIG. 21, a micrograph of another like written data bit in the same medium and same write energy, etc. shows this threshold region at higher magnification.Also, here, the associated contact surfaces evidently accommodate, or induce, small glob incipient agglomeration more, smaller globs , typical of a moderate to low threshold surface cf. same fissured fluoro polymer overcoat as before . Some conclusions TABLE A l Thus, in light of the subject teachings, a worker can, in designing and fabricating an optical disk record for given read write radiation energies presumably using an information layer absorber with anti reflective background and suitable fissured face overcoat, as above optimize sensitivity and bit formation etc. via teachings herein, such as the following 1.Apply the absorber layer as a very thin, miminum mass, minimum size island configuration e.g., nucleating strike can help too one can monitor for first reflectance minimum while depositing 2. if he desires, use a relatively high meltingpoint absorber material e.g., gold for extended service life 3. preferably optimize sensitivity by making virgin isles very small minimum mass, size and uniform in size, being uniformly spaced and distributed and also he can arrange contact surface characteristics interfacial energy vs. molten isle with relatively low threshold surfaces to induce the smallest, most uniform size, distribution written globs, and full agglomeration at relatively moderate temperature, yet with high moltenisle mobility interfacial energy being only high enough to assure good spherical agglomeration at moderate energies, yet little higher lest threshold TO be raised unduly and Massive glob agglomeration induced 3a. substrate characteristics can help optimize this e.g., a fluoro polymer with light nucleating strike of SiO2, MgF2 or the like, to form minimum mass virgin islands whereas, surfaces of Cr, Bi, Al, or their oxides, are non helpful 3b. fissured face overcoat e.g., fluoropolymer also helps, as above explained. Contact surface factors molten islands vs. surface of underlying and or overlying layer For adequate island migration mobility and agglomeration , one supposes that the interface region between the top of the spacer layer and underside of the overcoat i.e., where the island gold information layer resides exhibits passages channels, gaps, etc. through which molten islands can migrate. How readily this occurs along these passages will be determined by island size and temperature, and by the relative interfacial energy i.e., energy of molten gold in contact with the surrounding host surfaces . Thus, a non fissured overcoat like the well known SiO2 is undesirable thoughSiO2 is desirable as a nucleating strike film on the substrate spacer , whereas a fluoro polymer is quite apt cf. fissured face discussed . When the gold islands are large e.g., seeFIG. 18 with respect to such passageways that must accommodate their agglomerating travel , such migration will presumably be impeded. When the temperature of melting is low and trilayer detuning is relatively minimal, migration distances prior to cooling and solidification will be short. The magnitude of this interfacial energy of melting gold in contact with surrounding surfaces is important in two respects. First, it is the increase in interfacial energy, upon melting, which causes the gold islands to assume their spherical shape they tend to minimize surface area per unit volume . Any increase in surface energy, therefore, represents a barrier to melting and will effectively raise the threshold temperature at which trilayer detuning commencts. Second, the driving force for agglomeration is the decrease in surface energy per unit volume represented by a distribution of fewer large particles , rather than more small particles. The bit formation exemplified in FIGS. 20 and 21 represents a more optimal balance of the above considerations. Thus, min mass size virgin isles extremely small initial island size assures the free est and least impeded migration moreover, it can impart an extremely high initial surface area per unit volume, and thereby increase the driving force for agglomeration. Thus, the EX. VI situation will usually be most preferred. A phenomenological Model for the Agglomeration Mechanism The bit formation agglomeration mechanism here proposed for trilayer media incorporating island gold as the information layer is believed to consist of two stages melting, then agglomeration that is 1st. Melting of gold islands, accompanied by a shape change more spherical and simultaneouç opticaldetuning here AR of the trilayer and 2nd. Subsequent movement and coalescence agglomeration of the molten islands to form a distribution of larger globs spherical debris particles in which the optical losses are small. The effective temperature at which melting and trilayer detuning occur is determined by interfacial energy differences between the solid and liquid states of gold in contact with the host spacer, overcoat surfaces.This effective melting temperature is thought to be well below the bulk melting temperature of gold. The shape change associated with island melting is a consequence of an increase in interfacial energy with the change from solid to molten gold in contact with the host surfaces. Upon melting, the gold islands, irregular in shape as deposited, revert to tiny spheres, thereby minimizing contact area at the presumed high energy interfaces. Workers will understand that optimal agglomeration appears to require that contact surfaces substrate, overcoat in contact with the molten islands during writing not only be fissured , but also exhibit a characteristic interfacial energy Eif with the molten isles. Energy Eif may be understood as consonant with a wetting or physical affinity of molten isle to contact surface . In cases where the increase in interfacial energy with the change from solid to liquid gold in contact with the surrounding material is large , an energy barrier to melting exists which causes the effective melting temperature to be high. This situation corresponds to a medium with a high threshold power for writing and low island mobility In cases where the increase in interfacial energy is small, the effective melting temperature is low. This situation corresponds to a medium with a low threshold power for writing. The driving force for agglomeration of the molten gold islands is the decrease in surface energy per unit volume represented by the change from a configuration of many tiny particles to a configuration of few large particles. The mobility of molten islands during the agglomeration phase is a function of their temperature and their size. Small islands utilize available passages at the spacer overcoat interface more efficiently than large islands, and are thus more mobile. High temperatures imply a longer migration lifetime, thus prolonging the time available for agglomeration prior to solidification cooling, which the de tuning encourages, of course . Some further conclusions Thus, for instance, a general teaching hereof is that, in fashioning OD disks with an absorber film in trilayer c onfiquration as described , one can achieve surprisingly good sensitivity by laying down the absorber material in island form. Beyond that, one is taught that noble metals like gold, palladium, etc. or their alloys may be so deposited as the absorber e.g., to enhance archival life while securing good sensitivity. Variations Workers will appreciate that such island films may comprise other metals, or their alloys, in certain cases e.g., other binary alloys of Au or Pd, ternary alloys, etc., or other metals such as Pt, Cu, Ag, Rh . In the usual instance, the absorber film will be advantageously combined in an anti reflection or like optical background array. Such island films may, in certain instances, be otherwise deposited, e.g., by other vapor deposition techniques vapor deposition is very practical where, as in EX. I, etc., it may also be used to deposit other related layers such as the reflector, spacer, etc. . Vapor co deposition will usually be preferred for alloys . Other methods may be feasible for depositing the absorber, such as sputtering. In any event, it will usually be preferred to monitor the film during deposition to closely control the deposited island configuration. Also, other recording applications for such absorber films will occur to workers, such as for electron beam or infra red recording.
