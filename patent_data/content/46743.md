# A device in splash preventers.

## Abstract
To restrict the flow of water through a splash preventer 5 fixed to the outlet spout of a water tap and to maintain this flow substantially constant, independent of the water pressure, an elastomeric plate 4 provided with a hole 10 is placed on an upper surface 9 on the splash preventer at right angles to the flow of water. Channels for the passage of water between the hole and channels 7 communicating with the outlet of the splash preventer are formed on said surface 9 of the splash preventer in a preferred embodi ment of the invention. For increasing water pressure against the upper surface of the plate, portions of the bottom surface of the plate are partially pressed into said channels for the passage of water to reduce their through flow area.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A device in a splash preventer fixed to the outlet spout of a water tap, and provided with channels letting through water and air, characterized by a water flow obturating means 4 which, independent of the water pressure, always assumes the same angle relative the flow direction and which is provided with at least one hole 10 through which the water flows, with first and second surfaces facing away from, and towards the flow direction, the first surface being directly or indirectly subjected to the pressure of the water and the second surface being elastomerically compressible for coaction with a surface 9 on the splash preventer, said surface forming an angle to the flow direction, whereby for increasing water pressure against the first surface the second surface elastically presses against said surface on the splash preventer in the flow direction, thereby reducing the size of channels between the latter surface and the second surface, said channels leading water from said hole iso to channels 7 communicating with the outlet of the splash preventer. 2.

## Description
TITLEA device in splash preventers DESCRIPTION Technical field The present invention relates to a device in a splash preventer fixed to the outlet spout of a water tap, and provided with channels letting through water and air.Background art Splash preventers of the kind described above are known in a great variety of embodiments. Eany of these have one or more drawbacks. For example, they have a complicated and expensive structure, they do not limit the flow of water to the desired extent and neither do they smooth out pressure variations in this flow.Disclosure of invention The object of the present invention is to provide a device in a splash preventer by means of which the abovementioned drawbacks are removed. This object is achieved by the invention being given the characterizing features disclosed in the claims. The foremost advantages of the device in accordance with the invention is that the flow through the splash preventer is reduced to a predetermined level, and that this flow is substantially constant independent of pressure variations in the flow of water supplied to the splash preventer at a pressure which, especially in the water supply of a multi storey building, can vary considerably between the taps in the lowest and highest apartments. Other advantages are that the device has a simple and therefore cheap structure, it is simple to install, and that it eliminates the shrieking noise sometimes occurring in flowrestricting means of a conventional kind.DescriPtion of figures Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of a device in a splash preventer according to the invention, and Pig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the device in acoordance with the invention.Preferred embodiments The device shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are each intended to be fitted to the outlet spout not shown of a water tap. The device illustrated in Pig. 1 includes four main parts, namely a sleeve 1 provided with an internal thread 1b, an air and water blender 2 a gauze 3 and a rubber ring 4, while the device illustrated in Pig. 2 includes three main parts, namely a sleeve identical with the sleeve 1, also denoted by the numeral 1, an air and water blender 5 and a ring identical with the ring 4, and also denoted by the numeral 4. The blender 2 illustrated in Pig. 1 is intended to be inserted into the sleeve 1 with its lower edge engaging against an inwardly directed flange la thereon. The blender 2 is provided with channels 6 around its periphery, connecting the interior of the blender with the air outside of it, there also being a large pluarlity of substantially axial channels 7 defined between an annular outer portion 8 of the blender and triangular recesses in a central insert 9, these channels distributing and leading water to the interior of the blender for blending with air and for further passage out through the lower central outlet of the blender.The gauze 3, which is provided with meshes overlapping each other at the intersection points, is intended to be laid above the upper flat surface of the insert 9 and to be kept there by the portion 8 projecting slightly over this surface. The rubber ring 4, which is flat and provided with a central hole 10, is intended to be placed on top of the gauze 3, and it then also covers the upper surface of the annular portion 6. The parts 2, 3 and 4 are kept in place inside the sleeve 1 by the inner thread 1 b on the latter being screwed onto the outer thread of the outlet spout of a water tap, until the lower circumferential edge of this spout sealingly presses the ing 4 against the portion 8. When the tap provided with the device according to Pig. 1 is opened, water flows through the hole 10 into the ring 4, the amount of water coming into the blender 2 being iimieed ted RQ an extent dependent on the hole diameter Since the ring 4 is made from rubber, this limitation of the flow does not cause any shrieking noise, which otherwise occurs in conventional flow restriction. After passage through the hole 10, the water flow is distributed equally over the surface of the insert 9 by means of the gauze 3 and continues through the channels 7 into the blender 2, where the water jets are blended with air flow ing in through the channels 6, thereafter to stream out for use. If the water pressure against the upper surface of the ring 4 is low, the under surface of the ring will engage against the upper side of the gauze with a relatively low pressure, and the water can flow radially outwards relatively unencumbered to the channels 7 via the meshes in the gauze 3.If the water pressure is high, however, the ring 4 will be pressed relatively tightly against the gauze 3 and portions of the underside of the ring will be elastically pressed into the meshes of the gauze, whereby the through flow area between the hole 10 and the channels 7 is reduced, and thereby the flow of water to said channels. The size of said through flow area thus varies in response to the water pressure against the ring, and therefore the amount of water taken out from the splash preventer will be substantially constant, irrespective of the water pressure. The blender 5 shown in Fig. 2 is intended to be inserted into, and retained by the sleeve 1 in a mode similar to that inFig. 1, and is identical with the blender 2, excepting that the upper surface of the insert 9 is knurled or otherwise provided with projections and or depressions forming a given pattern which form shallow channels. These replace the channels formed by the meshes in the gauze 3 in Fig. 1. In the embodiment according to Fig. 2, the lower surface of the rubber ring 4 thus rests not only against the annular portion 8 but also directly on the upper surface of the insert 9, which is provided with channels, and in response to the water pressure acting on the upper surface of the ring 4, the upper surface thereof will be more or less pressed into these channels, thereby keeping the amount of water passing through the splash preventer substantially constant.The unit comprising parts 1, 5 and 4 is assembled and screwed onto the outlet spout of a water tap in a mode similar to the one in which the unit comprising parts 1, 2 and 4 in Pig. 1 is fitted and screwed on. Even if only two embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to these embodiments. Por example, instead of the gauze 3 in Pig. 1 or the upper surface of the insert 9 being provided with ridges and or recesses in Pig. 2, the bottom surface of the ring 4 can be provided with ridges and or recesses forming channels between the hole 10 of the ring 4 and the channels 7. Furthermore, the ring 8Scan, for example, be replaced by a plate with several smaller orifices distributed over it. The invention is thus only limited by what is disclosed in the claims.
