# Manufacture of composite of metal and synthetic inorganic fibrous material.

## Abstract
A method for the production of a shaped article comprising a synthetc inorganic fibrous material and a binder therefor which method comprises forming a slurry of the constituents therefore with a liquid, introducing the slurry into a mould and pressing the slurry to expel liquid therefrom in one direction to obtain orientation of the fibres in the resultant shaped articles characterised in that i the slurry is introduced into the mould and is subjected to hydrostatic pressure to a predetermined threshold pressure without substantial settlement of the slurry solid. ii further pressing at a pressure above the threshold is accompanied by monoaxial orientation and deposition of the fibres. iii the rate of deliquification is controlled so that at least 95 of said fibres have an orientation within 15 degrees of said axis and iv the initial pressure exerted in the pressing step is such that the density of the resultant dried article is at least 0.4 gm cc
