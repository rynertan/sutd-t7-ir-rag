# Method for fabricating a master recording disc.

## Abstract
In a method of fabricating a master recording disc, a pho toresist layer is formed on a glass substrate to form a master blank, which is revolved and exposed to an intensity modu lated laser beam so that a series of optically excited regions is formed in track turns in the photoresist layer. The optically ex cited regions are removed, forming a series of pits in the pho toresist layer. An etchant gas is sputtered onto the master blank until the pits in the photoresist layer extend through the boundary surface of the photoresist layer and the glass sub strate to a desired depth and pits having side walls tapered in a direction away from the boundary surface are formed in the substrate. The photoresist layer which remains on the glass substrate is finally removed.
