# Installation of communications cables in underground pipes.

## Abstract
For running communication cables to dwellings and other buildings to enable the distribution of information e.g. in a cable television system to or collection of information from those buildings, use is made of the pre existing underground pipes which serve to drain sewage and or surface and storm water away from those buildings. The cables preferably are secured to the surface of the sewage draining pipes, preferably along the soffit of those pipes and for example by clips fixed at intervals.
