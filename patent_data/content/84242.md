# CONTROL LEVER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A lever is integral with a rotatable hub 40 . A brake lever 70 pivoted on a pivot 16 is biased by a spring 76 to urge a brake show 74 against part of the hub 40 . A detent lever 80 pivoted on the same pivot 16 is biased by a spring 88 to engage a detent roller 84 with a sector of the hub containing detent notches 62, 64 . A centering spring biases the lever hub 40 to the illustrated, neutral position. A rotary cam 26 acts on cam followers 72, 82 on the brake lever 70 and detent lever 80 to disengage both brake and detent in the position shown. The cam is rotatable to other positions by a solenoid 90 pawl 92 and ratchet wheel 36 , one position allowing the brake to engage establishing a friction held mode for the lever and another position allowing the detent to engage, providing for detent holding of the lever in its spring centred mode.
