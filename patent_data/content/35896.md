# Method for treating an olefin polymer to remove catalyst residue therefrom and shaped articles of the treated polymer.

## Abstract
A method for treating an olefin polymer comprises con tacting an olefin polymer obtained by polymerizing an olefin in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a highly active transition metal compound, B an organoaluminum com pound and C a carbonyl or Si containing electron donor, with D an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table after the polymerization. By this method the amount of electron donor remaining in the olefin polymer after polymerization is reduced and with it the offen sive odour which the polymer gives off.
