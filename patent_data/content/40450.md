# Gettering device and picture display tube having such a gettering device.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing a picture display tube a gettering device is used which comprises a first metal holder 1, 20 and a second metal holder 3, 28 . A source 2, 21 of evaporable gettering metal is accommodated in the first metal holder 1, 20 from which the gettering metal can be released by inductive heating. A gas source 6 of a material having a comparatively high decomposition temperature and releasing gas upon heating is accommodated in the second metal holder. The second metal holder is connected to an outer surface 7, 30 of the first metal holder in such manner that the second metal holder forms an electric shunt for the induction currents generated in the first metal holder by the inductive heating. In this manner it is achieved that during the inductive heating the temperature of the second metal holder and its contents lead with respect to that of the contents of the first metal holder. As a result of this the gas releasing material 6 releases its gas before the gettering metal begins to evapo rate from the source 2, 21 of gettering metal. The invention is suitable in particular for use in the manu facture of colour display tubes in which the gettering device is assembled in the tube before the window 12 and the cone 11 of the colour display tube are connected together by means of a sealing glass 18 .
