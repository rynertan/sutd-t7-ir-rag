# Pressure measuring system with increased accuracy for a constant resolution.

## Abstract
A parameter measurement system includes a parameter measurement loop 16, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, Cfa, 44, 48 generating a digital signal N1 indicative of a parameter Pa Pb being measured, a common mode measurement loop 22, 24, 36, 38, 40, 42, Cfa, 44, 48 generating a digital signal N2 indicative of an element Pa of the parameter Pa Pb , and a calibration circuit 46 which outputs the parameter Pa Pb as a function of the digital signals N1, N2 and a temperature signal T .
