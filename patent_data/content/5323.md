# Processing of metal chlorides.

## Abstract
Metal may be recovered from metal chlorides, for example a mixed metal chloride residue from the fluidised bed chlorination of a titaniferous ore in the presence of carbon to produce titanium tetrachloride by heating, in the presence of a scavenging agent, which may comprise a combination of titanium dioxide and carbon inherently present in a residue from the afroesaid fluidised bed chlorination process, to at least 1500 C and preferably to a temperature at which iron present is liquid. If the temperature is maintained at below 2200 C iron, vanadium and niobium may be recovered preferentially to certain lower value metals which remain in the form of chlorides giving the possibility for the recovery to a high value mixed metal product. Titanium trichloride may be formed and this may be chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride thereby increasing the efficiency of the original chlorination process.
