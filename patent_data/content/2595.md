# Transponders.

## Abstract
A tag transponder which is capable of receiving a signal from a transmitter by antenna 2, 3 and re transmitting the signal after a delay. The incident electromagnetic wave from the transmitter is converted into an acoustic wave in a piezoelectric member 4 of the tag 1 , the acoustic wave traversing the piezoelectric member before re transmission as an electromagnetic wave the lower velocity of the acoustic wave compared with the electromagnetic wave provides the delay between the signal received and transmitted by the tag. During the signal pulse from the transmitter the tag continuously re transmits the signal, and the re transmitted signal from the tag is sustained after cessation of the signal from the transmitter for a sufficient duration to be distinguished from the other transient reflected signals.
