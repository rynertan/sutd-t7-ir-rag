# Load control and holding valve.

## Abstract
The said type of valve has a first unidirectional valve 11 and a second unidiredtional valve 14 with oleo dynamic unlocking, on to the closing mechanism 14a of which exerts an effect a pilot piston 17 which is subjected, on one surface of a pre established extension, to the pressure existing in a first inlet or outlet orifice 12 of the valve itself. Furthermore, the said valve is provided with a device for regulating and limiting the pressure, and this supplies the piston 17 with a control pressure whose value falls within a pre established minimum and maximum.
