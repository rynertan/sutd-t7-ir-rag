# Low trans fats and oil and water emulsion spreads containing such fats.

## Abstract
A fat blend having a relatively low level of trans fatty acids, which is preferably lower than 10 is obtained by random interesterification of lauric fats, saturated fats and a minor proportion of partially hydrogenated fats. A good melting behaviour in the mouth is achieved without recourse to fractionation.
