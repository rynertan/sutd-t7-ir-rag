# Making undercut mouldings.

## Abstract
Undercut mouldings are made by injecting a crosslinkable and foamable composition 15 based on a polymer of ethylene into a mould 11, 12 having an undercutting surface 14 . The composition is heated in the closed mould to cause crosslinking and foaming. When the mould is opened the contents expand 16 and free themselves from the undercutting surface. Preferred compositions include homopolymers of ethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers containing 1.8 weight of dicumyl peroxide as crosslinking agent and 1.7 weight of azodicarbonamide as foaming agent.

## Description
MAKING UNDERCUT MOULDINGS This invention relates to a method for making under cut mouldings. An undercutting mould surface impedes and often prevents removal of a moulding from the mould. In some cases the difficulty can be overcome by using complex contractable mould components but these atz expensive and cqmplicate the moulding cycle. It has r been discovered that certain compositions comprising pol S of ethylene can be moulded in such a way as to cause the moulded composition to free itself from an undercutting surface of the mould. Accordingly this invention provides a method for making undercut mouldings which comprises a introducing a composition comprising a molten polymer of ethylene, a crosslinking agent and a chemical foaming agent into a mould having an undercutting surface and closed components which resist expansion of the composition but which can be opened to enable expansion of the composition, b subjecting the composition within the closed components of the mould to a temperature sufficient to activate the crosslinking agent and sufficient to decompose the foaming agent so as to enable it to expand the composition on opening the closed components of the mould, c opening the closed components of the mould to enable expansion of the composition by the foaming agent whereupon the expanding composition moves away from and ,frees itself from the undercutting surface of the mould so facilitating removal of a foamed crosslinked moulding from the mould. The moulding may move away from the under cutting surface sufficiently far to clear the surface or merely sufficiently far to allow the moulding to be removed from the surface with the aid of a resilient deformation of the moulding. The extent to which the moulding moves away from the undercutting surface is governed by the concentrations of crosslinking and foaming agents employed in the composition, by the temperatures used during moulding and by the time taken to perform the moulding cycle which in turn is governed by the thickness of the moulding. The moulding cycle usually takes from 10 to 360 secods. The etntposition preferably contains from 0.2 to 6 especialJy from 1 to 4 by weight of crosslinking agent and from 0.2 to 6 especially 1 to 4 by weight of a chemical foaming agent. Typical crosslinking agents used with polyolefins include dicumyl peroxide, 1,3bis tertiary butylperoxyisopropyl benzene and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5, di tertiary butylperoxy hexyne 3. Typical chemical foaming agents used in polyolefins include azodicarbonamide, p,p oxybis benzene sulphonyl hydrazide and others as described in Kunststoffe volume 47 No. 8 1957 pages 446 to 455. The crosslinking agents may be used with the co agents such as triallyl cyanurate or activators such as m phenylenedimaleimide.The foaming agents may be used together with the usual aids such as oxides, hydroxides or soaps especially stearates of alkaline or alkaline earth metals especially magnesium or zinc. Prior to the opening of the closed components of the mould, the composition in the mould is preferably heated to a temperature of from 150 to 2100C especially 170 to 190 C . Generally the composition is injected into the mould under a pressure of from 1.7 to 70 especially 6.5 to 35 MN m2. The polymer mmay be a homopolymer of ethylene preferably made by a free radical initiated polymerisation or it may be a copolymer. The preferred polymer is a co polymer of ethylene with up to 25 preferably 5 to 20 by weight of an unsaturated ester of a carboxylic acid, especially vinyl acetate or a methyl ethyl or butyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acids. Preferably the polymers have a melt flow index of from 0.5 to 50 especially 1 to 10 g 10 minutes as measured according to British Standard 2782, part 1 105C 1976 using a 2.16 Kg load and carried out at 1900C. The composition may also contain the usual fillers such as chalk, dolomite, barytes, talc, clay, wood flour and slate flour, and the usual stabilisers such as antioxidants or light stabilisers, processing aids such stearic acid, pigments and plasticisers such as dioctyl phthalate. EXAMPLE A composition of the following formulation was made up 95 by weight of a copolymer of ethylene with 18 by weight based on the copolymer of vinyl acetate and having a melt flow index of 2 g 10 minutes, 1.8 by weight of a crosslinking agent which was dicumyl peroxide, 1.7 by weight of a chemical foaming agent which was azod icarbonamide, 0.75 by weight of zinc oxide to promote a more uniform decomposition of the foaming agent, and 0.75 by weight of stearic acid as a processing aid. The composition was heated to 1150C and injected into the mould having closed components which is hereinafter described with reference to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the drawings. The mould was hot and was allowed to heat the composition to about 1800C in order to activate the crosslinking agent and to decompose the chemical foaming agent liberating its nitrogen to 1800C. The closed components of the mould resisted expansion of the liberated nitrogen. After the composition had reached tut 180 C, the components of the mould were opened enabling te liberated nitrogen to expand and cause the composition to expand with it. It was discovered that the expanding composition moved away from and cleared the undercutting surface of the mould so permitting easy removal of the foamed crosslinked moulding from the mould. Examples of moulds suitable for use in the performance of rhis invention will now be described with reference to the drawings in which Figure 1 shows in section a mould used in making fishing floats. rigure 2 shows a section on the line A A of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows in section the mould of Figure 1 after L mld components have been opened. Pique 4 shows in section a mould used in making shoe eels. Figure 5 shows in section the mould of Figure 1 after the mould components have been opened. Figure 6 shows in section a mould used in making a bellows. Figure 7 shows in section the central component of the mould of Figure 6 after the other mould components have been opened and removed. Figure 1 shows a mould 1 composed of closed mould components 2 and 3 and central mould component 4 having undercutting surfaces 5 and 6. An annular inlet 7 in closed components 2 and 3 allows a molten crosslinkable tcambie polymer composition 8 to be injected into mould i. It will be understood that if composition 8 were to solidify, undercutting surfaces 5 and 6 would prevent its removal undamaged from the central component 4 of mould 1. On heating composition 8 and opening mould components and to potions shown in Figure 3 composition 8 expands and crosslinks to form solid moulding 9 shown inFigure 3. During expansion, composition 8 moves away from central component 4 so that it frees itself from and clears undercutting surfaces 5 and 6 with the result that moulding 9 can be easily removed from central component 4 of mould 1. Figure 4 shows a mould 10 for use in moulding shoe heels. Mould 10 is composed of closed mould components 11 and 12 and a threaded stud 13 having an expanded head 14.Stud 13 is screwed into component 11 and serves to define a recess 17 see Figure 5 in the moulded heel so that when subsequently the heel is glued onto a shoe the glue can key into the recess 17. A molten crosslinkable foamable polymer composition 15 is injected into mould 10 via an unshown inlet. It will be understood that if composition 15 were to solidify, undercutting head 14 would prevent its removal undamaged from mould 10. On heating composition 15 and opening mould components 11 and 12 to positions shown in Figure 5, composition 15 expands and crosslinks to form solid moulded shoe heel 16. During expansion, composition 15 moves away from stud 13 so that it frees itself from undercutting head 14 leaving head 14 making a loose engaqement with recess 17 in moulded heel 16. Pulling downwards on heel 16 causes a resilient deformation which permits heel 16 to be pulled off stud 13 undamaged. Figure 6 shows a mould 20 composed of closed mould components 21 and 22 and a central mould component 23 having undercutting peaks 24. A crosslinking foamable composition 25 is injected into mould 20 via an unshown inlet. On heating composition 25 and opening mould components 26, composition 25 expands and crosslinks to form solid bellows 26 which is well clear of central undercutting mould component 23.
