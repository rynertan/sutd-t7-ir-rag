# Socket retainer.

## Abstract
An elastic ring for maintaining a pin 26 in a hole formed in a socket and work drive shaft 10 of a rotary tool. The ring has integral fingers 24 which project into the ends of the hole so that the pin 26 cannot dislodge the ring by centrifugal force when the tool is operating at high speed. Several variations of the ring include weighted areas at portions of the ring midway between the fingers 24 , which areas counterbalance centrifugal force on the ring to supple ment holding force of the fingers upon the pin 26 .
