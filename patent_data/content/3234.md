## Description
PROCESS AND DEVICE FOR NONLINEAR EQUALIZATION ON SEQUENCES OF DIGITAL SIGNALS The present invention relates to digital transmission sy stems and is particularly concerned with a process and device for nonlinear equalization on sequences of digital signals, which can also be used for transmissions at rates faster than Nyquist s. It is well known that one of the greatest obstacles to the accomplishment of digital transmissions at a very high speed is given by the intersymbol interference. Due to this interference each pulse is overlapped and distorted by postcursors of preceding pulses or precursors of following pulses, so that at the receiving side the effects of said precursors and postcursors are to be compensated by the so called equalizers. In the case of high rate transmissions good results have been obtained for compensating the effects.of postcursors and pre cursors by using nonlinear structures, for instance of the decision feedback type. Yet, further investigations of the inventor have led to the consideration that still better results could be achieved by proces ses and devices operating on pulse sequences. This allows to realize equalizers without feedback loops. The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for equalizing digital signals, wherein for a nonlinear com pensation of the effects due both to postcursors and to precursors of the pulses to be equalized, said pulses are estimatedafirst time start ing from a pulse sequence from the estimated pulses or pulse se quence, signals are obtained compensating at least the effects of the precursors of the pulses of said sequence and said compensation signals are then combined with the pulses to be equalized, delayed by the time necessary for carrying out both the evaluation and the calculation of the compensation signals, so as to correct their effect. Another object of the present invention is the device performing the process. The invention will be best understood by referring to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of the invention Figs. 2 and 3 are two variants of the embodiment of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a second embodiment of the invention and Fig. 5 is a block diagram of a third embodiment of the invention, In Fig. 1, DS1 denotes a device able to carry out the eval uation of a sequence of digital signals transmitted over a line 1. More particularly, DSl may be a Viterbi receiver, i. e. a device accomplishing an evaluation on the ground of the Viterbi algorithm, as de scribed for instance by G. D. Forney in the paper The Viterbi Al gorithm in Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 61, no. 3, March 1973. Due to evaluation operation, a pulse sequence is obtained at the output of DS1, in which distorsions due to postcursors are compensated at least partly. PRl denotes a device for generating, on the ground of the pulses of the evaluated sequence, signals compensating precursor effects in particular, PR1 may be able to determine the values of the precursors. DL1 denotes a conventional delay line able to delay the sequence to be equalized, transmitted on line 1, by the time necessary for the evaluation operations in DSl and for the determination of pre cursors in PR1. OC1 denotes a device for correcting the precursor effects, able to combine the compensation signals delivered by PRl with the sequence to be equalized, outgoing from DL1. Therefore, at the output of OCl a sequence will appear in which the effects due to precursors have been compensated at least partly. DS1, PRl, dCl, DLl on the whole make up. a first cell, denoted by EQ1, of the equalizer according to the invention. DS2, PR2, OC2, DL2 denote units identical to DS1, PRl, OC1, DL1, forming a second equalization cell EQ2, wherein a second sequence evaluation and a second correction of precursor effects is carried out. Since the evaluation and determination of precursors are accomplished starting from the sequence already corrected in the first cell, the probabilities of errors of evaluation and determination of precursors are reduced with respect to the first cell consequent ly, the correction accomplished in OC2 on the distorted sequence, delayed in Dbl and Db2, will be obviously more effective than the one obtained in EQl. Further cells identical to EQ1, EQ2, could be foreseen to improve the correction. To obtain at the equalizer output a sequence, wherein also postcursor effects are compensated, the last equalizer cell, denoted by EQn and represented only partly, may have, after the correction unit OCn, a further sequence decision device DS n l which will execute the evaluation on a sequence where precursor effects have been eliminated and therefore will deliver at the output a sequence completely lacking in intersymbol interference effects. FS denotes a possible shaping filter for shaping the received pulses so that the first postcursor interfering sample of each pulse is near or equal to zero, and at least the second postcursor sample is positive and has possibly a modulus greater than the one of subsequent samples. Thus the influence of postcursor samples following the first one can be reduced notably or made negligible. An embodiment of the filter FS has been described by the inventor in the Italian patent application No. 67417 A 77 in the name of the applicant. A filter as FS makes less onerous the task of sequence decision devices, as these ones can operate on sequences in which the influence of postcursors is reduced. At the same time, at least in the case in which the equalization cells following FS include aViterbi receiver, the conditions necessary for making negligible the influence of postcursor samples following the first one must not be observed so strictly as when the decision on single pulses is taken, as the Viterbi receiver gives for itself an excellent estimate of the sequence, taking postcursors into account, In Fig. 2, in which the same symbols denote the same units of Fig. 1, filters PR and correction units OC of the different cells of the equalizer of Fig. 1 have been replaced by units denoted by SCl, SC2 ... and CC1, CC2 ... respectively. Units SC are arranged so as to obtain from the sequence evaluated in the decision devices DS signals for compensating the effects both of postcursors and precusaw units of this kind are known in the art and named channel simulators.Units CC1, CC2 ... are able to accomplish on the sequence to be equalized a combined correction of the effects both of precursors and postcursors. The use of devices SC instead of devices PR makes easier the operation of the devices deciding the sequence in the cells follow ing the first one furthermore, as each of said decision devices operates on sequences on which postcursors have been subjected to an additional correction, it is evident that the error probability will be reduced in a quicker manner, and therefore less cells can utilized. In Fig. 3 the correction of postcursor effects is performed only in the first cell and by using means different from the ones accomplishing the correction of precursor effects in this way a sequence can reach the subsequent decision devices having the postcursor corrected once for all. Therefore the units PRI, LOCI, already described with reference to Fig. 1, will be still present. In this figure the output of DS1 is also connected to a unit PS1 able to determine the values of postcursors, or in general signals compensating their effects, and a further correction unit CPI is foreseen, similar to OC1 and arranged to perform the correction of postcursors effects in the sequence outgoing from delay line DLla. It can be noted that the unit OCI corrects the sequence al ready purified of postcursors, which sequence is fed to OCl through a delay line DLlb. The second cell EQ2 is identical to the one of Fig. 1. For drawing simplicity, the filter FS and the cell EQn are not shown. In order to simplify the structure of the equalizer the sequence deciding units DS2 ... DSn could be replaced by devices taking the decision on the individual pulses. In this case the first decision unit DSl could also be realized by a device using a whole sequence for deciding the individual pulses. An example of device of this second type is the so called Ungerboeck receiver the principle on which a receiver of this type operates, is described by Ungerboeck in the paper Nonlinear equal ization of binary signals in Gaussian noise , IEEE Transactions onCommunication Technology, Vol. COM 19, No. 6, December 1971. The embodiment of the invention in which only the first decision takes into account a pulse sequence is shown in Fig. 4,wbete FS, DLla, DL2b, CP1, OC1 denote the same devices as in the previous Figures. DS 1 is a decision device operating on sequences of signals arriving on line 1, and providing either a whole estimated sequence if for instance a Viterbi receiver is used or the estimated individual pulses of a sequence if the Ungerboeck receiver is for instance used . PS 1 and PR 1 are devices having functions similar to devices PS1 and PR1 in Fig. 3 in case of a decision unit providing the estiSe of the individual pulses of the sequence, PS 1 and PR I will be arrant for operating on individual pulses. DBI denotes a conventional decision unit able to receive and to estimate individually the pulses outgoing from OC. The described blocks form a first equalization cell EQ 1. DL2, PR 2, OC2, DB2 denote units similar to DLlb, PR1, OC1, DBl these form a second equalization cell EQ 2 wherein asecont correction of precursor effects and a second individual decision of pulses are performed. As the precursor determination and the estimate are performed starting from the sequence already corrected in the first cell, the erro probabilities are reduced with respect to the first cell there fore, the correction performed in OC2 on the distorted sequence, delayed in DLlb and DL2, will be obviously more effective than that obtained in EQl. Further cells, structurally like EQ 2, will be in case able to improve the correction. The iteration of the decisions is very advantageous, since when the pulse has been exactly decided in a cell, it improves automatically the decision in the subsequent cells. Really, it can be said that, in case of ertor for instance of DBl, the pulses preceding the one on which the decision has been taken would be affected with an intersymbol interference more accen tuated in the part concerning the precursor, while the subsequent pulses would be affected with an inter symbol interference more accentuated in the part regarding postcursors. Consequently the decision unit DBZ would operate on more distorted signals owing to one interference or to the other or, in the worst case, to both. However, the probability that DB2 takes a correct decision can still be relatively high in that the effects of said interferences affect the pulse coming from CPl, which differs from the one decided in a wrong manner and outgoing from DBl.Yet, in case of error also in DB2, it can happen that a subsequent decision unit, on receiving a new cor rection signal obtained from the unit corresponding to PRZ and thepulse purified of the postcursor, furtherly delayed by a delay line, takes a correct decision. By increasing the number of equalization cells, the probability of compensating the errors of the preceding cell or cells will increase. Generally speaking a pulse, decided in a wrong manner inSle decision circuit DBl, can appear in the subsequent decision circuits82 with the precursor compensated, if also the subsequent pulse has not been decided wrongly. Should this unfavourable hypothesis occur and should the pulse outgoing from DB2 be also wrong, this pulse can be delivered to the decision circuit of the subsequent cell, where the interfering sample of the previous signal will be compensated most probably if the further signal decided by DBl is correct. This new signal decided correctly will then compensate the precursor interfering sample relevant to the previous pulse,wh will then be decided correctly by DB2 in the subsequent cell thecon sation of the precursor of the signal considered will then occur, andso on. In some conditions, the decision device DBn of the last cellEQ n can be followed by a further unit DSa operating on signal se quenchs DSa can be advantageously followed by a chain of decision devices such as DB1 ..., the chain possibly ending in a decisiondsmke of the same kind as DSa, and so on. Furthermore, when the intersymbol interference is not as an additional information on the correlation between the received signals, the first equalizer cell can be preceded by the shaping filterFS. The device operation comes clearly out from what said before, therefore it will not be described in further detail. What described is given only by way of example and not in a limiting sense, and variants are possible without exceeding thescope of the invention. For instance, it is evident that the postcursor correction methods adopted for the diagrams of Figs. 2 and 3 are interchangeable. Furthermore, in case of very short sequences for which the risk that postcursors of pulses of a sequence affect the pulses of the subsequent sequence, it is possible to teed back at the input ot the sequence. decision device DS1, the correction signal obtained in PS1 Fig. 3 even if this produces greater circuit complexities due to the necessity of inserting further delay lines. Still further the circuits of Figs. 1 to 4 are easily fit for a generalization, which is very useful for increasing the performance of transmission systems via satellite. The generalized diagram is shown in Fig. 5, wherein Lt, NLEZ ... denote nonlinear devices which can be sequence deciding devices, symbol deciding devices taking a sequence into account or decision devices for single symbols. PRCl, PRC2 ... denote devices for signal processing, each connected to the output of a decision device NLE units PRC have the function of correction units and give at the output signals with reduced intersymbol interference in the most complex cases devices PRC can be true processors Ri, R2 ... denote delay lines, which deliver to correction units PRC the signals to be corrected, delayed by the time required for perfor ming the estimate operations. Device NLF can be all identical, therefore the equalizer is of the iterative type. The correction iteration allows the error probability in the transmission system to be gradually reduced to an asymptotic value, next to the value occurring when intersymbol interference is absent. As an alternative, the different equalizers NLE could be of a different type iterative mixed equalizer by choosing the different types so that each one gives an excellent protection against a given kind of interference, the combination of a different equalizers enables the attainment of a better equalization. It may also be useful that the different decision units NLE and the various correction units PRC exchange information to each other the term information exchange denotes the possibility that the signals processed in one of the devices NLE and PRC are delivered to the devices NLE and PRC preceding them or following them inside the chain. These would employ for their operations the informa tion provided by the redundancy, interference a. s.o. of pulses or pulse sequences already partly corrected consequently, the system performance would be still improved. The means for the information exchange are denoted in the diagram by wires al a2 bl b2 cl c2 dl d2 converging towards a common connection 2 or getting away from it. Equalizers of this kind can be defined of the iterative integrated type if the units NLE are alike, and of iterative mixed integrated type if the units NEE differ from cell to cell.
