# Molecular model for chemistry.

## Abstract
Molecular model building members for the formation of models of molecules and compounds primarily in the field of organic chemistry. Model building members 10, 60 are dimensionally accurate, can be interconnected and or inter locked, when they are rotatable about their axes, and can thus be used to form specific molecular models. Model building members depicting a double molecular bond 80 and a triple molecular bond 90 can be interconnected and or inter locked with the model building members 10, 60 . All of the aforementioned model building members 10, 60, 80 and 90 are formed from a polypropylene copolymer material result ing in the members being inherently flexible while retaining sufficient rigidity to depict strain in molecular bonding. Because of this flexibility, the rotatability of the members, and the manner in which the members can be interconnected and or interlocked, models of all known molecules and com pounds in the field of organic chemistry can be formed.
