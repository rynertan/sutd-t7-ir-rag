# Freewheel devices.

## Abstract
A freewheel device for connecting a power input 16 to a selected one of a plurality of outputs 19, 25 so as to transmit rotary motion in one direction of rotation and to over run when the speed of the selected one of the outputs exceeds that of the input, includes a neutral condition in which the input is rotationally disengaged from any of the outputs. In a described embodiment, the freewheel device comprises a plurality of rollers 50 retained circumferentially adjacent one end of an axially movable shaft 17 in operative association with a plurality of wedge shaped portions formed on the shaft, axial movement of the shaft serving to engage the rollers between the wedge shaped portions and, selectively, axially spaced apart internal cylindrical surfaces formed on each of the outputs and on a rotatable support 41 . The freewheel device finds particular application in the transmission system of multi engined helicopters.
