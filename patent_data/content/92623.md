# Precipitation hardening austenitic superalloys.

## Abstract
Precipitation hardening, austenitic type super alloys containing 0.5 to 1.5 weight per cent silicon in combination with from 0.05 to 0.5 weight per cent of a post irradiation ductility enhancing agent selected from hafnium, yttrium, lanthanum and scandium, alone or in combination with each other. In addition, when hafnium or yttrium are selected, reductions in irradiation induced swelling have been noted.
