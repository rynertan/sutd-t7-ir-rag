# In line electron gun structure for a colour cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
In line electron gun structure for colour cathode ray tubes in which the final focussing and accelerating electrodes each employ three in line tapered, partially overlapping apertures in facing relationship, and at least one pair of electron beam spot shaping inserts associated with the central aperture of the focussing electrode.
