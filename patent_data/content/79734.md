## Description
Additive for fertilisers The invention relates to an additive for fertilisers, especially fertiliser solutions for the inhibition of nitrification. In addition to other nitrification inhibiting substances, it has recently become increasingly common to add dicyandiamide to nitrogen fertilisers for the better exploitation of the nitrogen content.The use of dicyandiamide in liquid fertilisers fertiliser solutions is of particular interest. However, because of the physical properties of dicyandiamide, there are a number of difficulties, for example the difficulty of incorporating the dicyandiamide, which is relatively only sparingly soluble, in such solutions.In many cases the solubility of dicyandiamide is in fact too low to obtain the concentration desired for practical purposes. For example, DE OS 27 02 284 discloses dicyandiamide containing nutrient solutions and, in particular, NP and NPK fertiliser solutions, but the solubility of dicyandiamide therein is very low. In addition, fluctuations in temperature of the solutions result in coarse crystalline dicyandiamide precipitates which settle, so that, at least to some extent, the product is incapable of fulfilling its task of inhibiting nitrification. Furthermore, when the solutions containing dicyandiamide are stored for a relatively long period, even with slight temperature differences, large dicyandiamide crystals may separate out and these prevent uniform spraying of the solution.A further disadvantage is the low rate of dissolution of the dicyandiamide which is a result of its moderate solubility. We have now found that use of an inorganic component, and in particular a water insoluble inorganic compound having a large specific surface area, is advantageous in ensuring that the dicyandiamide remains dispersed even at low temperatures and there is no appreciable change as a result of separation or crystallisation effects. Accordingly, the present invention provides a nitrogen fertiliser comprising the fertiliser, an inorganic dispersion forming agent and dicyandiamide. The fertiliser is preferably a fertiliser solution and the inorganic dispersion forming agent and the dicyandiamide may, for example, be added together to the fertiliser and for this purpose may be formulated as a mixture. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a nitrification inhibiting additive for fertilisers comprising dicyandiamide and an inorganic dispersionforming agent. The inorganic dispersion forming agent is generally finely ground and may comprise, for example, i a water insoluble inorganic compound having a large specific surface area or ii a water insoluble inorganic compound having a large specific surface area and a dispersing or wetting agent. Generally, the inorganic compound is substantially insoluble in water at normal temperatures ca. 20 C and has a specific surface area of at least 10 m2 g as measured by the BET method see Rmpp s ChemieLexikon, 7 Aufl., Vol. 1, page 355 . Suitable water insoluble inorganic substances are, for example, various types of silica, such as, for example, aerosil, kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth, furnace dusts resulting from the manufacture of silicon or ferrosilicon, aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, kaolin, bentonite and montmorrillonite. Attapulgite, a needle like magnesium aluminium hydrosilicate, is preferably used The effective surface area of such inorganic compound, as determined by the BET method, preferably is at least 10 m2 g, preferably up to 300 m2 g, more especially at least 15 m2 g and more especially up to 250 m2 g. Combining these oxides or silicates with dicyandiamide compensates for the disadvantage of the low solubility of dicyandiamide and low rate of dissolution.The dicyandiamide particles are maintained in suspension until the fertiliser solution is applied. Surprisingly, in addition, the dicyandiamide is reliably prevented from crystallising out when stored for a relatively long period or when cooled. Such dispersions are therefore extremely stable and can be applied using conventional spraying apparatus since there is no danger of recrystallisation. The dicyandiamide used may be of any quality, provided it is substantially free from phytotoxic impurities. A dicyandiamide having a degree of purity of at least 98.5 is preferably used. Generally, finely ground dicyandiamide is used.Preferably, the grain size should not exceed 0.5 mm.Thus, for example, substantially all particles may be 4 0.5 mm, more especially 4 0.2 mm. Dicyandiamide of average particle size X 0.3 mum, for example 4 0.2 mm, and commercial dicyandiamide in which 60 to 70 of the particles are 4 0.075 mm may also be used. The preparation of an additive of the invention may be carried out by mixing an appropriate quantity of the inorganic component with finely ground dicyandiamide. The operation may be carried out, for example, in a concrete mixer, DRAIS mixer or double cone mixer. The content of the inorganic component should preferably not greatly exceed 50 by weight. Dispersion in the fertiliser solution may then be carried out by sprinkling in an appropriate quantity of additive and then pumping round or stirring round. In a different embodiment, the additive is advantageously added to the fertiliser solution as a highly concentrated aqueous suspension. For this purpose, a quantity of the inorganic component sufficient to form a viscous slurry that is still capable of being poured is first mixed with water and the desired quantity of dicyandiamide added subsequently. In this case too, the proportion of the inorganic component preferably does not greatly exceed 50 by weight of the total additive. The advantage of an aqueous suspension of this type is the simple and rapid dispersion of the additive in the fertiliser solution even without special mixing apparatus. This, for example, may be advantageous for the farmer who wishes to add the agent immediately before applying the fertiliser solution. A further variant of the process is, for example, to mix the inorganic component homogeneously with the dicyandiamide which is still moist from the manufacturing process and which has a water content of, for example, up to 25 by weight, and then, optionally, to dry them together. Such premixed additives are distinguished by particularly good flowability and ready dispersibility in fertiliser solutions. Because of their excellent flowability, these additives can also be accurately metered into solid fertilisers. The additive is preferably made up of from 1 to 50, more especially 2 to 30, parts by weight of the inorganic component together with from 50 to 99, more especially 70 to 98, parts by weight of dicyandiamide. When using the additive in highly concentrated aqueous form, the solids content of the dispersion is preferably at least 30 , preferably up to 95 , more especially 30 to 70 , by weight. Certain types of silicic acid readily ascertained by those skilled in the art are preferably used with the addition of a dispersing agent whereby they are more readily suspensed in the fertiliser solution.Examples of such dispersing agents are, for example, lignin sulphonates or sulphite modified amino striazine formaldehyde condensation products. Preferably such dispersing agents are added in an amount of from 0.1 to 5 by weight, more especially 1 to 3 by weight, calculated on the total additive. The additive may be added as a nitrification inhibitor to nitrogen fertilisers, especially aqueous nitrogen fetiliser solutions. Suitable fertilisers are, for example, those mentioned in DE OS 27 02 284. More especially, the present invention provides a liquid nitrogen fertiliser solution containing a composition comprising from 50 to 99 by weight of dicyandiamide and from 1 to 50 by weight of magnesium aluminium hydrosilicate capable of forming an aqueous suspension. The following Examples illustrate the invention.In the Examples the Attagel 40 and Attagel 150 used have a surface area of 210 m2 g determined by BET.Example 1 Dicyandiamide having a grain size of 0.2 mm was mixed in a tumbling barrel with a finely disperse pyrogenic silica BET surface area 18 m2 g formed in the manufacture of ferrosilicon in an electric furnace. Three different batches of additive, containing respectively 10, 30 and 50 by weight of silica, were manufactured. The resulting products were incorporated by means of a slow speed stirring apparatus into an ammonium nitrate urea fertiliser solution having a 28 nitrogen content and consisting of 39.5 by weight of ammonium nitrate, 30.5 by weight of urea and 30 by weight of water. The quantity of additive introduced was in each case 7 by weight of dicyandiamide calculated on the fertiliser solution.This quantity was above the saturation limit of dicyandiamide in this solution, which, at 200C is only 5.5 t. The stirring time required for the complete dispersion of the additive after introduction into the fertiliser solution and the degree of deposition after a stirring time of 10 minutes at a stirring speed of 140 rev min were ascertained. The results are given below.Table 1EMI6.1 tb Proportion SEP of SEP silica SEP in tb additive SEP SEP by SEP weght SEP 10 SEP 30 SEP 50 tb Stirring SEP time SEP in SEP minutes tb until SEP complete SEP dispersion SEP ca.0.5 SEP ca.l.O SEP a.1.0 tb Proportion SEP of SEP the SEP disper tb sion SEP remaining SEP in SEP suspen tb sion SEP t SEP by SEP volume SEP after tb SEP 1 SEP hour SEP 35 SEP 78 SEP 93 tb SEP 2 SEP hours SEP 27 SEP 54 SEP 77 tb SEP 4 SEP hours SEP 22 SEP 40 SEP 70 tb The pulverulent additives had a good flowability and could be metered without difficulty. The dispersion was carried out in each case within 1 minute by slight mechanical agitation, such as slow stirring, shaking or pumping round.As long as the movement continued, the homogeneous suspension did not settle.Similar results were obtained using bentonite and montmoril lonite. In contrast, the inorporation of dicyandiamide alone into fertiliser solutions of the same composition presented considerable difficulties in powder form it did not flow freely and agglomerated in the fertiliser solution to form relatively large lumps which stuck to the wall and base.Example 2 Dicyandiamide having a grain size of 0.2 mm was mixed by roller burnishing in a mill containing rods and balls with a needle like type of attapulgite Attagel 40, Engelhard having an average particle size of 0.00014 mm. Three batches of additive, containing respectively 10, 30 and 50 by weight of attapulgite, were manufactured. The pulverulent free flowing additive was stirred under the same conditions as in Example 1 into the same ammonium nitrate urea fertiliser solution. The stirring time in which the additive was completely dispersed and also the relationship of its suspendability to the standing time were ascertained and the results given below.Table 2EMI7.1 tb Proportion SEP of SEP attapulgite SEP in tb the SEP additive SEP in SEP SEP by SEP weight SEP 10 SEP 30 SEP 50 tb Stirring SEP time SEP in SEP minutes tb until SEP complete SEP dispersion tb 140 SEP rev min SEP ca.O.5 SEP ca.5.0 SEP ca.7.0 tb Proportion SEP of SEP the SEP disper tb sion SEP remaining SEP in SEP suspen tb sion SEP in SEP SEP by SEP volume SEP after tb SEP 1 SEP hour SEP 49 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 2 SEP hours SEP 33 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 4 SEP hours SEP 28 SEP 99 SEP SEP 100 tb The powders, which gave a very good flowabiiity, could be metered rapidly and without difficulty and could be dispersed rapidly.

Dispersion was then carried out by means of a heavy duty mixer Turrax at 2000 rev min. Two solutions were prepared as follows i by adding 4.7 by weight, calculated on the fertiliser solution, of additive consisting of 90 by weight of dicyandiamide and 10 by weight of attapulgite, ii by adding 6.2 by weight, calculated on the fertiliser solution, of additive consisting of 67 by weight of dicyandiamide and 33 by weight of attapulgite.The relationship of suspendability to standing time of the solutions was as follows Table 3EMI8.1 tb SEP Proportion SEP of SEP the SEP disper tb SEP sion SEP remaining SEP in SEP suspen tb SEP sion SEP in SEP SEP by SEP volume SEP after tb SEP 1 SEP day SEP 7 SEP days SEP 14 SEP days tb Addition SEP according SEP to SEP i SEP 100 SEP 40 SEP 30 tb Addition SEP according SEP to SEP ii SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb Even after 10 weeks storage at 50C, the fertiliser solution according to addition ii did not precipitate any dicyandiamide crystals larger than 0.2 mm.Example 4 Mixtures of dicyandiamide grain size 0.2 mm and attapulgite Attagel 150 manufactured by rollerburnishing were mixed with water. These liquid mixtures were added to the ammonium nitrate urea fertiliser solution described in Example 1. After a stirring time of 10 minutes with a slow speed stirrer 140 rev min , the suspendability was assessed. The quantity of dicyandiamide added was in each case 7 , calculated on the fertiliser solution.

The amount of dicyandiamide added was greater than its solubility at 200C nevertheless, no precipitation of dicyandiamide crystals was observed.In addition, the crystal growth of the dicyandiamide was so greatly retarded that, even after many weeks storage, no crystals over 0.2 mm were formed. Without the addition of attapulgite, a fertiliser solution of this type shows dicyandiamide crystals of over 1 mm and crystal intergrowth after only a few days. When the fertiliser solution containing additive d was cooled to 0 C, no appreciable crystal growth was observed even after several weeks, so that dispersions of this type can be applied without restriction using commercial spraying apparatusExample 5 The additive consisting of dicyandiamide 66 grain size 0.2 mm attapulgite Attagel 150 32 calcium lignin sulphonate 2 was mixed with water dispersion with 40 water and stirred by hand into the same nitrogen fertiliser solution as in Example 1.The amount of additive dispersion added to the fertiliser solution was such that that solution contained 7 dicyandiamide.The additive dispersed very rapidly and homogeneously in the fertiliser solution even though added by hand.After 3 minutes continuous stirring round by hand the solution was left no deposits were observed after 7 days. The solution was subjected to a 3 week varying temperature test in which it was stored in succession for 1 day at 200C, 1 day at 100C, 1 day at 200C, 1 day at 50C etc.. No dicyandiamide deposits larger than 0.2 mm were observed.Example 6 Moist dicyandiamide water content approximately 10 average grain size 300 p was mixed with attapulgite Attagel 40 in a paddle mixer at approximately 500C for 10 minutes. The additive manufactured in this manner and containing 5 by weight attapulgite was stirred in an amount of 4.9 by weight into the 70 ammonium nitrate urea fertiliser solution 28 N of Example 1 using a slowly rotating stirring apparatus 140 rev min . The mixture was completely dispersed after only approximately 1 minute after its introduciton. An additive manufactured in the same manner and containing 10 by weight of attapulgite was homogeneously dispersed within only approximately 30 seconds after the addition of 5.2 by weight of additive. Example 7 The additive was manufactured by first mixing the attapulgite Attagel 150 in water and then dispersing the dicyandiamide 1 0.5 mm, remainder 0.076 mm in this suspension. When the additive was added to the fertiliser solution of Example 1 by hand, particularly rapid mixing took place and the suspendability was also especially good. If, for example, 13.8 by weight of a liquid dispersion of this type which had a 55 water content and in which the weight ratio of dicyandiamide to attapulgite was 67 33, was added to the ammonium nitrate urea fertiliser solution, after shaking round vigorously once no crystal precipitates were observed even after 14 days. Example 8 1.65 by weight of an additive consisting of 90 by weight of dicyandiamide grain size 0.2 mm and 10 by weight of attapulgite Attagel 40 were stirred into a nitrogen phosphorus fertiliser solution, which contained 10 nitrogen and 34 P205 and which had a density of 1.4 g cm3, and were then dispersed with a heavy duty stirring apparatus at 2000 rev min.The dispersion was so stable that, even after 3 weeks storage at 0 C, there were still no deposits whatever.
