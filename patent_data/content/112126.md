# COMMUNICATION NETWORK AND METHOD FOR ITS USE

## Abstract
A local communication network for interconnecting data transmitting and receiving stations, such as computers. A number of stations are connected for transmission of data onto an outbound unidirectional bus and are connected to receive data from an inbound bus in series with the outbound one. A locomotive generator transmits locomo tives onto the outbound bus, and each station, if ready to transmit, adds a packet of data to the next passing train led by a locomotive. The resulting efficiency is relatively high and the network delay is relatively low, these figures being even further improved by the use of multiple locomotive generators or a regular interval locomotive generator. Other embodiments employ an open ring configuration, and a star coupler to minimize inbound losses.
