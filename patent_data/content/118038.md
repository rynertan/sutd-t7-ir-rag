# Fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
In a fuel injection pump wherein fuel is filled on both sides of a shuttle 10 intermediately disposed in a high pressure chamber for determining the injected amount and the injection timing of fuel, the fuel on one side of the shuttle 10 is used to determine the injection timing, and at the same time the fuel on the other side of the shuttle 10 is used to determine the injected amount, an injected amount determining high pressure chamber 8, 11 for determining the injected amount of fuel and an injection timing determining high pressure chamber 14 for determining the injection timing of fuel are provided independently of each other, a shuttle 10 is disposed in at least the injected amount determining high pressure chamber to form an injection fuel chamber and a pressurization chamber, the injection timing determining high pressure chamber is disconnected from said pressurization chamber in the supply process of fuel for determining the injected amount and fuel for determining the injection timing, and the injection timing determining high pressure chamber 14 is communicated with the pressurization chamber in the fuel injection process. Thus, the shuttle 18 for determining the injection timing will not be influenced by the fuel for determining the injected amount at the time when the fuel for determining the injected amount is supplied.
