# Method of preventing toner from scattering in an electrostatic copying machine.

## Abstract
A mass of residual toner which is charged is blocked by a blade member 17 held in slidable engagement with a photosensitive member 2 against movement therewith to ward a development roller 14 when an image is being formed on the photosensitive member 2. When no image is being formed thereon, the blade member 17 is lifted off the photosensitive member 2 to allow the mass of residual toner to move therewith toward the development roller 14. During this time, a bias potential having the same polarity of the toner is applied to members of an electrostatic or electro photograonic copying machine, located between the blade member 17 and the development roller 14 for repelling the mass of toner toward the photosensitive member 2 against being scattered off the latter and hance smearing surround ing pans.
