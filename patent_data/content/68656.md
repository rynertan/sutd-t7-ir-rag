# Electrical terminal with cavity compensator.

## Abstract
A terminal 11 for use in electrical connector housings 51 and the like which is press fitted into position and is retained in the connector housing 51 , printed circuit board or the like by means of a friction fit. The terminal 11 includes a rigid post 21 at one end and a resilient spring contact structure 23 at the other end thereof. The contact structure 23 and the post 21 are joined by an intermediate section 31 having an aperture 37 therethrough and a lance 43 extending outwardly from the bottom of the aperture 37 , the lance 43 being fittable into the aperture 37 but being of smaller dimenson. The intermediate sec tion 31 is a spring member having tapered sides 33, 35 with the narrow portion of the taper extending to ward the post 21 . The intermediate section 31 can move inwardly from both sides by spring type action to occupy a portion of the aperture 37 , thereby de creasing the dimension across the intermediate section 31 . Upon insertion into a housing 51 or the like, the lance 43 will push against a housing wall 47 and move the terminal against an opposite wall 49 as the terminal 11 enters an appropriate housing cavity 53 . As the terminal 11 moves farther into the cavity 53 , the tapered portion will move against the other pair of opposing cavity wall 55, 57 and force the sides of the intermediate section 31 together, thereby prevent ing the lance 43 from moving into the aperture 37 and providing a friction fit within the housing cavity 53 at the lance 43 as well as both sides of the inter mediate section 31 .
