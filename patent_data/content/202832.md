# Electronic null seeking goniometer for ADF.

## Abstract
In an electronic null seeking goniometer for use in automatic direction finding equipment a microprocessor is used to generate sine and cosine information in response to the detected phase of the bearing signal. The microprocessor iteratively locates the transmitter in the null of the cardioid response pattern of orthogonal loop and sense antennas 115 and 116 , without rotating either the loop and sense antenna set or the goniometer. This eliminates the require ment for moving antenna and goniometer components. The goniometer is entirely devoid of any rotating machinery. A loop feedback signal 127 functionally related to the de tected null angle provides a stable null location method, without audio distortion, at relatively high feedback signal ratios. The microprocessor generates sine and cosine angle signals 113 and 114 which are supplied respectively to multipliers 110, 111 to multiply the loop antenna signals. The outputs of the multipliers 110, 111 are subtracted 117 and the resultant difference signal 117 is zero when the null is found. The difference signal 117 is phase shifted 110 , modulated 119 , and added 122 to a sense antenna output 121 , and the result is detected 123 , phase detected 125 and filtered 129 to provide an error signal 130 which drives the iterative process of the microprocessor.
