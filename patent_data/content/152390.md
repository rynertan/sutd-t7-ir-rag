# Suction device.

## Abstract
A suction nozzle which when being stopped up automatically delimits the suction force in tne suction opening 2 to a certain predetermined value independently of the negative pressure in the suction conduit 11, 12 . The suction nozzle comprises a sleeve member 3 arranged at the front end of the suction conduit 1, 12 and which forms the suction opening 2 of the device. The sleeve member 3 is by a resilient member 4 held in a first position, suction position, in which it covers side passages 5,6 15 to the suction conduit 1 and in which suction is performed through the suction opening 2 . If the pressure difference immediately inside and outside the suction opening 2 exceeds a certain value, e.g. if the suction opening is stopped up, the sleeve member 3 is against the action of the resilient member 4 automatically displaced to a second position in which said side passages 5,6 15 to the suction conduit are opened, thereby reducing the suction force in the suction opening 2 .

## Description
SUCTION DEVICEBackground of the inventionThe present invention refers to a suction device comprising a suction conduit and a suction source connected thereto and further comprising a sleeve member arranged at the front end of the suction conduit and forming the suction opening of the device, said sleeve member is limitedly displaceable in axial direction from a first position, in which it covers side passages to the suction conduit to a second position in which said side passages are exposed.Suction devices of various kinds connected to a vacuum pump are used in for example surgery and dental care. One problem arising in this connection is that the nozzle opening may touch body tissues so that these will adhere to the nozzle by suction. Since upon such an occasion the vacuum pump continues to evacuate air out of the suction cordult, the pressure will be further reduced and the nozzle will adhere even more firmly. The result will be on one hand, that tissues may beInjured and, on the other hand, that the nozzle opening will be stopped up by loose objects.This problem can be solved in different ways. One way is to provide the suction conduit with a valve, or another member.which when the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the suction conduit exceeds a certain value. will open a flow connection between the suction conduit and the atmosphere. In this way the pressure in the suction conduit is never allowed to reach below this value, so that the risk of the nozzle adhering by suction will be considerably reduced. One drawback is however, that the valve also oens whe said pressure difference gets below this value due to tie fact that large liquid amounts are sucked up through the suction conduit.The problem of stopping up of the suction nozzle also occurs in many other connections, e.g. in vacuum cleaners which can adhere to rugs and carpets and the like.In US A 3, 913,577 is disclosed an aspirator for dental and surgical applications and rtaving a tip comprising g a tubular inner core with radial openings and a sleeve member telescoped over the core. The sleeve member also has radial openings and by displacing and rotating the sleeve with respect to the core, the openings are exposed or closed in order to provide a manual selection between greater suction or less suction in the aspirator tip. No automatic reduction of the suction force an tie aspirator tip is however provided if the tip would adhere by suction to the tissues.Lummary of the inventionThe object of the present invention is to provide a suction no2zle which, when being stopped up, e.g. adhered by suction, automatically reduces the suction force in the suction opening to a certain predeterminea value independently of the negative pressure in the suction conduit.This has according to the invention been achieved by the fact that a resilient niember is arranged to hold the sleeve member in said first pesition, in which suction is performed through the suction opening and that the sleeve member against the action of the resilient member due to a pressure difference immediately inside and outside the suction opening is arranged to automatically be displaced to said second position. in which the side passages to the suction conduit are opened. at which the suction force in the suction opening is reduced. Descriution of the drawangsThe invention will nuw be closer described with reference to ome embodiments shown in ine accompanging drawings.Figures 1 and 2 show sections through a first ernbodiment of the suction nozzle according to the invention in suction position and in a position where the suction opening has been stopped up. Figures 3 and 4 show sections through a second embodiment in suction position and stopped up position respectively.Figures 5 and 6 show sections through d third embodiment in suction position and stopped up position respectively.Figures 7 and 8 show sections through a fourth embodiment in suction position and stopped up position respectively,Figure 9 is a section according to the line ly ix in figure 2Figure 10 sows in detail a groove provided in a portion of the suction conduit. Descriotion of the embodimentsThe suction conduit is denoted wit the numeral 1 and is connected to a suctio source not shown. At rie front end of the suction conduit on the outside thereof a sleeve member 3Is arranged, which at its front end, the suction opening 2.possibly can be provided with a lattice or the like. The sleeve member 3 according to the embodiment shown in figure 1 and 2 is by a spring 4 held in the position shown in figure 1 and can against the action of said spring 4 be pushed backwards to the position shown Ir figure 2. The suction son duit 1 as well as the sleeve member 3 is provided with radial passages 5 and 6 respectively. which in the suction position shown in figure 1 are closed. at which the device only sucks through the suction opening 2.If, however, the suction opening 2 would be stopped up of a loose object or adhere by suction the sleeve member 3 will. due to the pressure diffeience inside and outside the suction opening 2. be pushed backwards against the action oi the spring i to the position shown in figure 2, in which the radial passages 5 and 6 will be located j just opposite each other and open a side passage t C. the suction conduit. The suction force in the suction openiriy 2 is by that reduced or completely leased, so that the adhere object is released. The device an, however. continue to su through the side passages 5 and 6.It is important to notice that the sleeve member 3 is not actuated by the negative pressure in the vacuum system, which also is dependent on the flow speed in the suction conduit ana thus increases upon suction of large liouid amounts. for enample. The sleeve member 1 is actuated firstly when the pressure difference immediately outside and inside the suction opening due to a stop, up rises above g certain value corres ponding to the spring force of the resilient element 4.According to the embodiment shown iri. figure 3 and 4 the resilient member 4 consists qf a disk of rubber, or another lesilient material, which is attached about a, pan 7 fixedly ectec to the sl sleeve member 3 at the lattice provided at the suction opening thereof.In the suction position shown in figure 3 the suction conduit communicates with the environment only th ough the suction opening 2, while in the position where it has been stopped up fig. 4 and the sleeve member 3 has beer. pushed backwards against the action of the resilient c 4, loe passages 8 and 9 between the suction conduit arid the sleeve member 3 are exposed and admit communicationDetween the suction conduit 1 and the environment.The embeciment shown in figure 5 and 6 differs from the one according to figure 3 and 4 by the fact that the resilient member 1 consists of a co called bistable spring. which in the suction position of the device fig. 5 takes one of its stable positions and in the position in which the suction opens ng has been stopped up arid the sleeve member 3 pushed ackwarcs takes its opposite stable position fig. 6 . Th etorn to suction position is made manually by means of a pin 10 exten g out through an opening in the suction conduit 1. In both previous embodiments the returrl to suction position takes place automatically when the pressure action upon the sleeve member 3 is below the spring force.n order te prevent unnecessary opening of the sleeve membe and in order tu keep a high flow speed through the suction opening the edge surface thereof can be wavy or toothed so that air is permitted to pass, as is shown in fig. 7 and 8. In this embodiment is further permitted a rnanual adjustment of the prestressing of the spring 4 and by that the opening pressure of the sleeve member 3. When sucking in sensitive parts of the, body. e.g. the brawn, it, is desired that the opening pressure is relatively low while in other cases considerably higher opening pressures can be tolerated.The suction conduit 1 is tn the shown embodiment provided with a number qf external bosses 11 on a certain axial distance from each other, while a tubular piece 12 arranged outside the suction conduit 1 and forming an extension thereof is provided with an internal groove 13 having the design shown in fig. 10.The groove 13 is designed to cooperate with the bosses 11, so that the tubular piece 12 can be locked in a number of different positions with respect to the suction conduit 1. Of course the tubular piece 12 can on its inside be provided with bosses 11. which can be locked in a groove 13 on the outside of the suction conduit 1. When displacing the tubular piece 12 with respect to the suction conduit 1 the prestressing of the spring 2. is changed. The tubular piece 12 is further provided with a number of external cams 14 forming a grip when manipulating the tubular piece. The prestressing of the spring 4 can of course be adgustable in many other ways than is shown here. The sleeve member 3 is tapered at its front end, i.e. the suction end at which openings 15 are formed between the suction conduit t. in this case the front edge of the tubular piece 12, and the sleeve member 3 in stopped up position when the sleeve member has been pressed backwards according to figure 8. The nozzle can then suck beside the stopped up tip.The radial passages 5 and 6 can possibly in this case be eliminated.The invention is of course not limited to the embodiments shown but can be varied within the scope of the claims. The device is not limited to suction devices for use in medical care but can be applied at e.g. vacuum cleaners and in all connections with suction devices where stopping up of the uc tion nozzle is a problem.
