# REMOTE METER DISPLAY UNIT

## Abstract
A remote meter display unit is connected to a meter index through a magnetically actuated single pole double throw switch cooperating with a magnet mounted on an index pointer shaft. The remote display unit is configured to increment a counter whenever the switch toggles. If the switch or any of the wires connected thereto are discon nected or shorted, the display is reset and maintained at zero. A portable reset preset unit mates with the remote display unit and includes switches for resetting the remote unit and entering any desired number into the display.
