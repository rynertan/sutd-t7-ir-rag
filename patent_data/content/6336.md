# Aqueous emulsion coating composition comprising self emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixtures.

## Abstract
A nongelled hydroxy ester copolymer composition substantially free of oxirane functionality comprising an acidic copolymer epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction pro duct, the epoxy resin being a mixture containing at least 5 by weight of aromatic polyether which is difunctional in oxirane functionality which is consumed by reaction with the acidic copolymer and the acidic copolymer being a solution copoiymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising at least about 20 of monoethyl enically unsaturated carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of monomers, the epoxy resin mixture constituting at least about 40 of the total resin solids content and providing oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric defi ciency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the acidic copoymer of from 1 2 to 1 20, at least a portion of the carboxyl functionality in the copolymer epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction product being reacted with a base to render the reaction product self emulsifiable in water.
