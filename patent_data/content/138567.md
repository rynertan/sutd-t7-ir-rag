# SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE LASERS

## Abstract
A semiconductor diode laser of the kind in which laser ra diation occurs in an active region in a layer 3 of semiconductor material wherein optical confinement of the radiation to a por tion 19 of said layer so as to direct light from said region to a light waveguide is obtained by virtue of differences in the re fractive index of different parts of said layer arising from me chanical stresses in said layer, produced, for example, by dif ferential thermal contracting during fabrication of the laser of different parts 96, 11b and 13, 15 or 21 and 5 or 23 and 3 of the laser structure.
