# Distillation process for separating silver and copper chlorides.

## Abstract
Purification of cuprous chloride is accomplished by distillation wherein cuprous chloride is recovered as the overhead product, and substantially all of the silver chloride and other impurities present report to the bottoms. Typical impurities in copper ore leach liquors include chlorides of silver, calcium, arsenic, bismuth, iron, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, tellurium, silicon, mercury, manganese, tin, alumi nium, magnesium, chromium, cobalt, cadmium, molybde num, zinc and titanium, most of which may be excluded in large part by crystallization of cuprous chloride. Measurable amounts of these impurities, however, report to the crystals, and silver tends to co precipitate with the copper in major amounts. Distillation accomplishes a high degree of copper silver separation and substantial elimination of other impuri ties from the copper.
