# Linear multilamp photoflash unit.

## Abstract
A photoflash unit 10 comprising a linear array of flash lamps 11 13 and 14 16 mounted on a printed circuit strip 18 disposed within the longitudinal channel 30 of an elongated housing member 26 . A light transmitting cover panel 28 is attached to the housing member for enclosing the flashlamps, and the circuit strip extends beyond the cover panel to expose connecting terminals. The lamps have tubular envelopes and are positioned with their longitudinal axes substantially paral lel to the printed circuit strip and arranged in substantially coaxial alignment. The housing member includes ledges 44 and 46 within the channel for spacing the printed circuit strip from the rear wall 40 , and the sidewalls of the channel have guide ribs 54 and 56 for engaging notches 50 and 52 in the circuit strip for facilitating assembly and location and avoid ing longitudinal shifting of the strip. The housing member further includes reflector cavities 11, 11 . etc. adjacent to the lamps, and a continuous coating of electrically conductive reflective material 42 covers the surfaces of the channel and reflector cavities for providing both reflective surfaces for flashing lamps and a shield to reduce the likelihood of acci dental flashing of lamps of electrostatic charges. In a prefer red embodiment, the unit has connector terminals at opposite ends, and the linear array of flashlamps is divided into two groups disposed in opposite halves of the unit, each group of lamps being operated by the connector terminals 20, 22 and 20 , 22 at the remote end so as to reduce the red eye photo graphic effect.
