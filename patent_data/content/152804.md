# Furnace system.

## Abstract
A furnace system connected to a burner 640 including a furnace 860 for burning a fuel and air ejected from the burner 640 into the furnace to produce a flame 650 therein, and a combustion condition determining device 660, 670, 680, 690, 710, 720, 730 for determining the conditions of combustion of the fuel in a zone of the flame extending along different strata thereof by collecting light in the flame at one point in the flame by moving such point. Signals outputted by the combustion condition determin ing device are utilized for monitoring or controlling the flame and controlling exhaust emission control devices 780, 790, 810, 820 for controlling exhaust emissions produced by the combustion of the fuel. Control of the conditions of combus tion of the flame can be effected quickly with a high degree of precision by monitoring the flame.
