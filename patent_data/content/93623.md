# Transceiver multiplexor.

## Abstract
A transceiver multiplexor 22 is adapted to receive data signals transmitted from a plurality of clustered local stations 14 and transmit the signals to a local area network com munication medium 16 via a transceiver 20 coupled to the multiplexor or transmit them to any one of the local stations. The multiplexor includes transfer means to perform this func tion. Collision detecting means is also provided in the multi plexor in order to determine the simultaneous occurrence of transmission between two or more local stations and provide collision signal to interrupt transmission from the involved stations. This collision detection supplements conventional collision detection at the transceiver capable of detecting transmission collisions when two or more transceivers are attempting communication on the medium but would not be capable of detecting collisions of transmitted data signals among two or more such clustered local stations. A collision among clustered stations connected to the multiplexor is determined from differences in data signals transmitted by two or more stations.
