# Glasses, methods for making them, and optical fibres containing them.

## Abstract
A glass suitable for use in optical fibre cores has a refractive index of 1.540 1.610, Na₂O and B₂O₃ in a molar ratio of 1.05 2 1, 2 12 mole per cent BaO, 40 63 mole per cent SiO₂, and 1.5 15 mole per cent ZrO₂, the proportion of SiO₂ and ZrO₂ together not exceeding 65 mole per cent. The glass can be prepared in a highly reduced state by the use of CO and a redox buffering agent. The glass is especially suitable for the production of high numerical aperture wide cored fibres.
