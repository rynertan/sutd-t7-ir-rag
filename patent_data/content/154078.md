# PLASMA TREATMENT APPARATUS

## Abstract
A plasma treatment apparatus is disclosed in which a sample 100 is placed on a cathode 24 held in an etching chamber 34 which is filled with CF₄ gas with a pressure of about 10 ² torr. A high frequency voltage is applied between the cathode 24 and anode 20 to produce a plasma. A magnetic field having a component perpendicularly in tersecting an electric field is generated above the cathode 24 by a magnetic field generator 60 . A magnetic core 62 involved in the magnetic field generator has a combed cross section and is comprised of a plurality of coils 70 . Every third coil is connected together to form three groups of coils. The three groups 72, 74, 76 of coils are respectively connected to the terminals of a 3 phase AC power source 82 having different phases. A high density plasma region is produced by a magnetic field. The electrons constituting the plasma are made to present a cycloid movement by the magnetic field, and generate a large number of ions upon collision with the molecules of CF₄ gas. Since the magnetic field is shifted along the surface of the cathode 24 , the sample 100 set on the cathode is uniformly etched by being evenly affected by a high density plasma region.
