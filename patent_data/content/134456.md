# Pinch rectifier.

## Abstract
A high speed semiconductor pinch rectifier attains low forward voltage drop and low reverse leakage current by utilizing depletion region pinch off of conduction channels in a high resistivity region. In a preferred form, the pinch rectifier additionally utilizes a Schottky barrier contact so as to facilitate device fabrication.
