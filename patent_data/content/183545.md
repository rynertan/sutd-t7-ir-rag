# Hydroformylation of olefins.

## Abstract
The higher alcohol yield of a hydroformylation process comprising catalytic hydroformylation of olefinic feedstock and hydrogenation of the crude product is improved by separating light materials and desired alcohols from the hydrogenated product, and then subjecting the remaining heavy materials to catalytic steam cracking at 260 380 C. The fraction of the cracked product which is rich in alcohol aldehyde is then separated and recycled, preferably to the hydrogenations stage.
