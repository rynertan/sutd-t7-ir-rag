# Latch mechanism.

## Abstract
For latching a tilt cab to a vehicle chassis 10 through an air spring 18 a pair of pivoted latch hooks 38 engage an annular catch 48 . They are locked in engagement by the head 52 of a plunger 34 biassed to the locking position by spring 62 . The plunger 34 can be released by hydraulic pressure applied at 60 and the latch hooks can then swing under the action of the spring 46 to the unlatched position. An annular actuating skirt 64 engages the tails 66 of the latch hooks to swing them into engagement as the cab descends onto the chassis.
