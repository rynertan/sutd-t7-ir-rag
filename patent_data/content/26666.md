# Method of producing sintered zirconia article.

## Abstract
A method of producing a sintered zirconia article which comprises mixing a 10 50 weight percent of partially stabilized zirconia powder obtained by sintering an admixture of zirconia powder and stabilizing agent therefor and pulverizing the sintered mixture, and b 90 50 weight percent of zirconia powder and stabilizing agent therefor, shaping the resulting mixture, sintering the shaped mixture, and then heat treating the sintered mixture at a temperature from 1200 to 1500 C. to obtain a sintered zirconia article not more than 70 weight percent of which is of cubic phase crystal structure and which is constituted by 5 40 weight percent of particles of 1 to 30 µ diameter and correspondingly 95 60 weight of particles of 30 300 µ diameter. The sintered article can have sufficiently high density and thermal shock resistance for use as an oxygen sensor.
