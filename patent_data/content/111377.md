# Photomultiplier tube assembly.

## Abstract
A photomultiplier tube assembly for use in high speed light testing apparatus for making a series of light measure ments in rapid succession. Electronic circuitry is described for removing noise from a light measurement signal gener ated by the photomultiplier tube. Other circuitry is described for switching the photomultiplier tube on and off and for sensing the presence or absence of a measured object in a testing apparatus.
