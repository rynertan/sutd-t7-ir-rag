# Operating theatre table light.

## Abstract
The light comprises a cluster of lamp units 100 , pivotally mounted at 6,7 , on respective chassis 8 running on a loop track. The lamp units are approximately equidis tant from a central axis and illuminate a common patch on the axis. Each chassis 8 is connected to a respective chain 35 which may be driven to move individual chassis 8 along the track, changing the configuration of the cluster. A linkage 26,27,31 enables the lamp unit inclination to be varied and a linkage 12,13,14,16,18 enables the relative positions of a bulb 1 and a concave reflector 10 to vary, thereby varying the beam width. The rollers 18 of each unit roll on a surface of a first common hoop and the rollers 31 on a surface of a second common hoop. The hoops are movable enabling the inclination of beamwidth of all the lamp units to be varied simultaneously, changing the patch range or size.
