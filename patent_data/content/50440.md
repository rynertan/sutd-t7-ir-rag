## Description
SULPHONIUM COMPOUNDS AND HERBICIDE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ThEM. This invention relates to products having herbicidal properties According to the invention there is provided a herbicidar composition comprising a compound of formula I Ph O CH2CH2S CH3 2X where Ph is phenyl and X is an equivalent of an anion, in admixture with an agronomically acceptable diluent or carrier. Many of the compounds of formula I are novel and the invention therefore includes compounds of formula I whereX has the meaning given above, except iodide. X is preferably a monovalent group and is preferably selected from halogen, e.g. chlorine, iodine or bromine, optionally substituted alkylsulphate, e.g. methylsulphate, optionally substituted alkylsulphonate e.g. methanesulphonate and trifluoromethanesulphonate arylsulphonate, e.g. benzenesulphonate and p toluenesulphonate and tetrafluoroborate. The compounds of the invention have herbicidal activity and in particular are active against yellow and purple nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus and Cyperus rotundus respectively . The latter weed has been classified as the world s worst weed in the book The Worlds Worst Weeds published in 1977 by the University Press of Hawaii. The compounds of the invention are generally active as post emergent herbicides and have little or no adverse effect at normal herbicidal rates on many crops in which nutsedges are a problem, e.g. maize, cotton, sugar cane, rice, soybeans, peanuts and turf. Because of the highly selective post emergent activity, the compounds need only be applied when the weeds can be seen to be a problem and hence unnecessary application is avoided, which can be the case with a pre emergent herbicide. The diluent or carrier for the compositions of the invention can be a solid or a liquid, an3 may comprise a surface active agent. The active compound can be employed in a wide variety of formulations, for example, a solution, a dispersion, a soluble powder, a dispersible powder or a granule. Preferred formulations are solutions and soluble powders. Solutions, preferably in water, can be of an appropriate concentration for direct application to the crop or they can be in the form of a concentrated primary composition, for example, a concentrated aqueous solution which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application. A concentrated aqueous solution can also contain a small quantity of a suitable agent to prevent foaming. Such concentrated primary compositions are a convenient way of supplying the consumer, and a further example is a soluble powder formulation which comprises the active compound in powder form optionally together with a humectant or flow agent, for example silica. As a dispersion, the composition of the invention comprises an active compound dispersed in a liquid medium together with a dispersing agent. The dispersant may be a high boiling hydrocarbon usually in association with a suitable wetting agent. A granular solid comprises an active compound associated with a solid powdery diluent, for example kaolin, the mixture being granulated by known methods. The concentration of the active compound in the composition of the invention can vary widely. In the case of a concentrated primary composition it is preferably from 15 to 99 per cent by weight. For example a concentrated aqueous solution may contain from 10 to 50 per cent by weight the concentration depending on the solubility of the compound, and a soluble powder will preferably contain 50 to 95 per cent by weight. The concentration of active compound in a composition intended for direct application preferably comprises from 0.001 to 10 per cent, more especially from 0.005 to 6 per cent by weight, although when aerial spraying of a crop is contemplated compositions having a higher concentration, for instance, up to 30 per cent by weight may be chosen in preference. The compounds of the invention may be used in admixture or in combination with other herbicides and especially post emergent herbicides used to control broad leaved and or grassy weeds. Examples of suitable herbicides include phenoxyalkanoic acids, e.g. 2,4 D, 2,4 DB, dichlorprop, MCPA, mecoprop and MCPB phenoxyphenoxyalkanoic acids, e.g. diclofop methyl and difenopenten pyridyloxyphenoxyalkanic acids, e.g.fluometuron and chloroxuron triazines, e.g. atrazine cyanazine and prometryne benzoic acids, e.g. dicamba ethers, e.g. bifenox and acifluorofen phophorus compounds, e.g. glyphosate and compounds of the type described in EPO specificatin 30424 and especially salts of 4 hydroxymethylphosphinyl 2 oxobutanoic acid bipyridyl compounds e.g. paraquat, dinitrophenols, e.g.dinoseb and its acetate picodinic acids, e.g.3,6 dichloropicolinic acid methylarsonic acid MSMA mefluidide bentazone methazole norflurazon alloxydim sodium sethoxydim and DPX 4189. We have also found that the activity of compounds of the invention can often be enhanced by the addition of surface active agents in amounts which are usually higher than are normally present in commercial pesticidal compositions. The surface active agent is generally non ironic although a blend of surface active agents may be used in which case at least one of the blend is preferably non ionic. The weight ratio of surface active agent to the compound of formula I is preferably in the range 10 1 to 1 10 e.g. 1 1 to 1 5. The novel compounds of the invention can be prepared by a reacting methyl 2 phenoxyethyl sulphide with an alkylating agent of formula, MeY, where Y is one equivalent of the anion of a strong acid except iodide , e.g. sulphate or p toluenesulphonate, or b treating dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium iodide to a double decomposition reaction to replace the iodide by another anion. If it is desired, salts produced by the above processes can be converted to other salts except to the iodide by a double decomposition reaction. The double decomposition reaction may be a precipitation reaction in which for example, a concentrated aqueous solution of the sulphonium methyl sulphate is reacted with a concentrated aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt or for example, in the case of the preparation of the chloride, with an aqueous suspension of silver chloride.The first reaction can be carried out in the presence of an. organic solvent, for example nitrobenzene, although this can be dispensed with when the alkylating agent is itself a solvent.Preferably the reactions are performed at a temperature of from 100 to 12000. The invention is illustrated in the followingExamples. Structures of novel compounds were confirmed by elementary and other appropriate analyses.Examples 1 3 Methyl 2 phenoxyethyl sulphide 5.04 g was mixed with methyl p toluenesulphonate 6.0 g and allowed to stand for 6 days. The mixture was triturated with ether and the product recrystallised from ethanol to give d imethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium p toluenesulphonate, m.p. 45 1470C. In a similar manner dimethyl sulphate gave dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium methyl sulphate, m.p. 94 960C, Example 2 and methyl trifluoromethane sulphonate in ether gave dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium trifluoromethanesulphonate, m.p. 1030r Example 33.Example 4 A solution of the product of Example 2 7.4 g in water 7.4 ml. was mixed with a solution of sodium tetrafluoroborate 7.4 g. in water. The product was filtered, washed with ice water and recrystallised from isopropanol to give dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium tetrafluoroborate, m.p. 72 760C. Example 5 A solution of dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium iodide J.C.S. 1947, 766 20 g. in water 400 ml. was mixed with silver chloride freshly prepared from silver nitrate 34 g. and sodium chloride 11.7 g. . The mixture was stirred for 23 hours and filtered whilst washing with water. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness at 20 30 C and the residue dried in vacuo to give dimethyl 2 phenoxyethylsulphonium chloride, obtained as crystalline solid which was too deliquescent for a melting point determination.Example 6 Tubers of purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus were planted in John Innes potting compost in 9 cm plastic pots and allowed to grow in in the glasshouse. When the young plants had 3 4 leaves and were 5 7 cm tall they were selected for uniformity and sprayed with aqueous solutions of the compound under study at various rates. There were three replicates per treatment. Damage to the plant was assessed after three weeks using a scale of O to 4 where 0 is no effect and 4 is complete kill. At a rate equivalent to 8 kg hectare the product of Example 5 gave a score of 2, the products ofExamples 2 and 4 gave a score of 3 and the products ofExamples 1 and 3 gave a score of 4. Dimethyl 2 phenoxyethyl sulphonium iodide the starting material ofExample 5 also gave a score of 3.Example 7 A powder formulation was made as follows. w wCompound of Example 1 95Sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate 0.1Silica to 100Example 8 The formulation of Example 7 was diluted with water and applied to purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus and yellow nutsedge Cyperus esculentus grown as in Example 6. Product was applied at the 2 3 leaf stage. Four replicates were used for each treatment. Three weeks after applying to yellow nutsedge a rate of 8 kg hectare gave 100 control. The same rate gave 98 control of the purple nutsedge after four weeks. Example 9 Example 8 was repeated in a similar manner. Tests were carried out in which 0.58 by volume of further surfactants were added to the formulaton. The results are shown below.Yellow nutsedge 6 weeks after sprayingEMI9.1 tb SEP SEP Control tb kg SEP of SEP compound. SEP .
