# Metal driving belt.

## Abstract
A driving belt having a trapezoidal cross sectional configuration and suitable to transmit a torque between expanding pulleys formed of pairs of conical discs defining a V shaped space between them for receiving the driving belt, which driving belt comprises a carrier in the form of one or a number of endless metal belts having a continuous series of transverse members 6 freely slidable with respect to the carrier thereon. In such a driving belt there may be a lateral vibration of the transverse members under certain conditions. This vibration, during which the transverse members 6 strike the carrier, results in wear, which can be considerably reduced by providing the parallel surfaces with which the transverse members contact each other with friction increasing means, such as a grooved surface.
