# Elastic suspension of sectionalized implements for tilling the soil.

## Abstract
A sectionalized implement for tilling soil comprises a main frame 1 on which the tools 2 are suspended in pivotal implement links 3 . Between the implement links 3 and the main frame 1 a spring mechanism 4 is inserted, which makes an elastic tension of the implements 3 pos sible in both upwards and downwards direction in relation to the surface of the ground. In this manner, the working depth of the implement can be adjusted to be either greater or less than the working depth that appears by means of the weight of the implement links. In transport position the leaf spring 5 operates as support member for the individual sections, and in this way the formerly used chains or locking mechanisms are ren dered superfluous.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A sectionalized implement used for the tilling of soil comprising a main frame 1 on which the tools are suspended in pivotal implement links 3 c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that a spring mechanism 4 is in serted be tween the implement links 3 and the main frame 1 , which mechanism makes it possible to exert an elastic tension of the implement links 3 in upwards and downwards direction in relation to the surface of the ground. 2 An implement according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the spring mechanism 4 consists of a leaf spring 5 extending backwards at right angles to the main frame, said spring being arranged to coact with a stepped rail 6 placed at the rear part of the implement link 3 .

## Description
ELASTIC SUSPENSION OF SECTIONALIZED IMPLEMENTS FORTILLING THE SOIL.TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a sectionalized tool for tilling the soil of the type which comprises a main frame on which the implements are suspended in pivotal tool links.BACKGROUND ARTFormerly, it was a problem to guide the working depth of tilling implements of a light construction.In order to counteract dissimilar working depth, stones and other heavy objects were formerly placed on the links to increase the self weight of the individual links.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe object of this invention is to provide a construction in which weight is transferred in a controlled gu ided manner from the frbnt frame of the implement to the implement link.According to the invention, the above object is achieved using an implement of the type mentioned in the introduction and characterized in that a spring mechanism is inserted between the main frame and the implement links, thus making it possible to exert an elastic tensioning on the implement links in upwards and downwards direction in relation to the surface of the ground. The working depth is primarily adjusted by changing the main frame through adjustment of the three point suspension of the tractor using the control handle. The finer adjustment is done by adjusting the spring tension. In case of heavy tilling equipment the tensioning may prevent too large working depth by deflecting the spring in a direction away from the surface of the ground.In a preferred embodiment of the invention the spring mechanism is formed as a leaf spring extending at right angles to the main frame and arranged for coaction at its free end with a stepped rail at the rear part of the implement link.In this manner, the spring tensioning can be adjusted in an extremely simple way, for instance, by placing bolts or the like in holes indicated by numbers. In transport position the spring acts as a support member for the individual sections. For this purpose it was formerly common to use chains or special welded locking mechanisms.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe invention will be described more in detail in the following with reference to the drawing, in whichFig. 1 shows an implement designed in accordance with the invention, viewed from the side, partly in section, andFig. 2 is a top view of the same. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTThe implement shown in figure 1 consists of a main frame 1 having an implement link 3 secured thereto in a manner known per se. The implement 3 is pivotal in re lation to the main frame by means 9f a pivot joint 7.When operating in the field, a support wheel 8 supports the implement link 3,and mainly S shaped harrow tines 2 are mounted in the implement links.A leaf spring 5 is attached to the main frame 1, said spring extending rearwards at right angles to the main frame 1 in relation to the direction of travel. The free end of said leaf spring 5 is arranged so that it can be placed between two bolts or pins led through corresponding holes in two rails provided with holes and placed at the rear end of the implement link.As it appears from figure 2, the leaf spring 5, in a preferred embodiment, may be tapered towards its free end.
