# Cross linked polyacrylate absorbent composition, method of manufacture therefor and absorbent articles containing same.

## Abstract
An absorbent composition is provided that comprises a copolymer of acrylic acid cross linked with a first cross linking component comprising a manomer having at least two vinyl groups and a second cross linking component comprising an ionic divalent cation. Optionally a fourth component may also be included comprising a monomeric species selected from certain methacrylic derivatives and acrylamide. This composition is preferably mixed with cellulose fibers to enhance wicking in absorbent articles, and is especially useful when incorporated as a powder between two plies of paper to make a two ply paper towel.
