# Recirculating automatic document feed device for a copying machine.

## Abstract
An automatic document feed arrangement employs top feeding and bottom stacking. A stack support platform is divided into two sections 38 and 39. Feeding is effected by feed wheel 40 and through guides 63 and 64 to the document glass. From the document glass, documents are fed back to the platform through guides 60 and 61. In order to allow bottom stacking, stack elevating rods in two groups 36 and 37 move along paths 56 and 57 in the directions shown. The rods pass up between the platform sections and under the stack to raise the stack to the position shown. Thereafter, when a sheet has been returned to the platform the rods continue along their path outside of the platform and the document thereon to lower the stack on to that document.
