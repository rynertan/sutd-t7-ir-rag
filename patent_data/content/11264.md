# Method and monitoring system for automatically monitoring the occurrence of a plurality of events in a cyclical process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a monitor system and method for monitoring the occurrence of events in a cyclical process. Whether the successive events occur at their proper positions within the process, position meaning, for example, a physical location and or a position in time, is accurately monitored, and the process is stopped and a warning issued when an event is missed. Monitoring can be restarted at a point of interruption with resumption of correct checking for succes sive events. Moreover, if an event is missed, the process and monitoring may be restarted and the missed event selectively automatically deleted from the list of sequential events for which the monitor system looks. The invention is employed, for example, in connection with a conveyor belt system to detect rips in the belt.
