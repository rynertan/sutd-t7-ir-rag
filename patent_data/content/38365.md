# METHOD OF CONTROLLING THE THICKNESS OF ROLLED SHEET IN A STRIP MILL.

## Abstract
Method of equalizing the thickness of a rolled sheet in a rolling mill for rolling a steel strip. In accordance with the method, a draft positioning control unit and or a tension adjusting unit in a rolling mill meysures, in order to memorize, the variations in the thickness of a steel band at the entrance portion of the rolling mill, by conducting sampling at a given interval Δt which is less than 1 5 the period of the response cut off frequency in each unit, and then computes control signals from two or more values among the memorized val ues at the interval Δt, the calculated value being utilized for draft positioning control and or tension adjustement.
