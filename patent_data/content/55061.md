## Description
MALE Sk .ETOCIDE METHOD IN SMALL GRAIN PLANTS, COMPOUND,COMPOSITION AND HYBRIDIZATION METHOD This invention relates generally to a method of producing a male gametocide effect in small grain plants, and, more specifically to a method of applying a 2 substituted cinchoninic acid compound to the plant at a time when the inflorescence primordium is present in the plant. The male gametocide effect of 2 substituted cinchoninic acid compounds in certain small grains is known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 4,009,020 discloses a method of producing male sterility in wheat by applying 2 trifluoromethyl 4 quinoline carboxylic acid to wheat, where the timing of application of the compound is based upon the leaf stage or joint stage development of the wheat. The use of leaf stage or joint stage measurement, as disclosed in the above mentioned patent, suffers from the limitation that such plant stage development is highly dependent upon environmental factors such as soil condition, soil moisture, climate, and the like. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a new method of applying such compounds that is minimally dependent upon such environmental factors. Small grain plants generally do not cross fertilize, but rather self fertilize. A highly effective male gametocide method is particularly desirable for such small grain plants, since efficient cross pollination and fertilization to produce new hydrids of small grain plants is encouraged by the prevention of self pollination and fertilization. It is an object of the present invention to produce a highly effective male gametocide method for use in small grain plants that is minimally dependent upon environmental factors such as soil conditions, climate, and the like. This and other objects of the invention will be apparent upon a reading of the following detailed specification. This invention provides a method for producing a male gametocide effect in a small grain plant. The method comprises applying to said plant, in an effective amount, at a time when the inflorescence primordium is present with respect to the plant being treated, of a compound selected from A a compound of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is selected from halogen and alkyl, aryl and alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, n is an integer having a value of from 0 to 2, and R2 is selected from a. chlorine and b. trifluoromethyl and B agriculturally acceptable functional derivatives of A selected from a. alkaline earth metal salts, b. mono , di or tri alkylamine salts of 1 to 2 carbon atoms, c. mono , di or tri alkanolamine salts of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, d.C l to C 4 alkyl esters, and e. amides, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or two C l to C 4 alkyl groups. The present invention also relates to the compounds per se and their compositions for use in the present method, as well as to a hybridization method using such a male gametocide effect. The 2 substituted cinchoninic acid compounds of the present invention are known compounds. Such compounds can be prepared in accordance with the methods given in U.S. Patent 4,009,020, incorporated herein by reference, or they can be prepared in accordance with the procedure disclosed by B. M. Pinder and A. Burger J. Med. Chem., ll,pp. 267 269 1968 , condensation of aniline, or a substituted aniline, with ethyl 4, 4, 4 trifluoracetoacetate in the presence of polyphosphoric acid to produce 2 trifluoromethyl 4 hydroxyquinoline from which the desired 2 trifluoromethyl cinchoninic acid can be obtained. The preferred cinchoninic acid used in the present invention is 2 trifluoromethyl cinchoninic acid, preferably.in the form of its ethanolamine salt. The method of the present invention is useful in treating any small grain plant, such as, for example, wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, and the like. The cinchoninic acid compound useful in the present invention is applied to the small grain plant at a time when the primordium inflorescence is present in the plant. This time is after flower initiation but before the flower primordia are differentiated in the plant. The initiation of the inflorescence primordium is primarily a function of the photo period the length of the night time and is minimally influenced by other environmental factors. Preferably, the inflorescence primordium is of a length between about 0.2 and 2 cm., more preferably between about 0.5 and about 1.5 cm., most preferably between about 0.6 and about 0.8 cm., wherein such length is measured from the first constricted area below the base of the inflorescence primordium. The 2 substituted cinchonicic acid compound useful in the present invention is generally employed at a rate of about 0.1 to about 10 lbs. per acre. When the 2 substitutFd cinchoninic acid compound is a 2chloro cinchoninic acid compound, an application rate of from about 1 to about 2 lbs. per acre is preferred.When the 2 substituted cinchoninic acid compound is a 2 trifluoromethyl cinchoninic acid compound, an application rate of about 1 4 to about 1 lbs. per acre is preferred more preferably 1 2 to 3 4 Ibs. per acre . The method of the present invention is not subject to any narrow temperature criticality. Rather, the method is useful at any ambient temperature at which the small grain plant crops can be grown. Although the active compounds used in the method of this invention may, in some instances, be applied directly in undiluted form to the plant to be treated, it is much more usual for the active compounds to be formed into a composition with a suitable carrier. By the term suitable is meant that the carrier is chosen having regard to the active compound employed and the plant being treated, so that it will not have any deleterious effect upon the method of the invention or the results obtained thereby. Depending on how the carpositicn is to be applied, the carrier could be a solid such as talc or vermiculite or a liquid such as water or other solvent and it is believed to be within the competence of one skilled in the art to choose the appropriate carrier for a particular compound and a particular application. It is frequently most convenient and economic if the carrier used is water, and the composition is in the form of an aqueous solution. The compounds used in the method of the present invention are, however, soluble to varying degrees in water. Therefore, as appropriate, they can be formed into aqueous solutions composed wholly or partially of water. Preferred solutions include those formed with water and, for example, acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, although practically any liquid solvent may be used, providing an effective growth regulating mixture can be formed. Where any particular compound of the invention has a limited solubility, it may be solubilized by the use of cc solvents and the like. When applied in the form of an aqueous solution, the total volume of solution applied will generally range from about 1 to about 150 preferably from about 1 to about 50 gal. acre. Although the preferred method of application of compounds used in the present invention is to apply it directly to the foliage and stems of the plant, it has been found that the compounds may also be applied to the soil in which the plants are growing and that when applied indirectly in that manner the compound will be root absorbed to a sufficient extent to result in plant responses in accordance with this invention. Example 1 Greenhouse Test A greenhouse test was conducted to determine the relationship between the inflorescence primordium length in Olaf spring wheat at the time of application of a solution of trifluoromethylcinchoninic acid and the.resulting percent male sterility of the wheat.,The trifluoromethylcinchoninic acid was applied as the ethanolamine salt to wheat planted in pots of sterilized soil by spraying at a rate of 0.5 Ibs. per acre in an aqueous .solution containing 0.1Z v. v of polyethylene glycol n onoolee surfactant. Five replications were made using one plant per pot and untreated check plants were used as a basis for comparison. The percent male sterility of the wheat plants was measured after treating the plants at inflorescence primordium lengths of 0.4 cm., 0.5 cm., or 1.3 cm., providing percent sterility responses of 65 percent, 100 percent and 81 percent, respectively. Thus, plant treatment at an i.nflorescenceprimordium length of 0.5 cm. provided maximum percent sterility in the greenhouse. A repeat test was conducted using.d.75 lbs. acre of trifluoromethylcinchoninic acid as the ethanolamine salt on Olaft spring water wheat to provide sterility of 100 percent of an inflorescence primordium length of 0.6 cm. Example 2 Field Test A field test was conducted to show the superiority of using the inflorescence primordium length measurement as opposed to the prior art method of leaf stage measurement to determine the tiring of applying of trifluoromethylcinhoninic acid as the ethanolamine salt Arthur winter wheat in the field by spraving at 0.5 Ibs. per acre of said acid. The results, as presented in Table I which follows, indicate that at a given leaf stage of development 5 leaf , the inflorescence primordium length can vary in the wheat fran 0.4 cm. to 1.4 cm. Measurement of the inflorescence primordium length provided a basis for maximizing the percent male sterility in the plant 100 percent sterility at 0.8 cm. length , whereas leaf stage development provided no such basis.
