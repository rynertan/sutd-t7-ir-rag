# Boresight tester for laser designators.

## Abstract
A testing device is disclosed for enabling the boresight alignment of a laser designator to be quickly and readily checked. The device includes a tubular housing 30 having a closed end 32 and an open end 34 adapted to be attached to the designator. A target disk 38 and a converging meniscus lens 42 provided with a reflective coating 44 on its surface facing the target disk are snugly disposed within the housing adjacent to its closed and open ends, respectively, with a tubular spacer 46 member interposed between and abutting the target disk and the lens. A portion of the laser light emitted from the designator is directed by the lens toward the target disk such that after a predetermined number of reflections from the target disk and the coating on the lens this laser light is focused to a small area on the target disk. The target disk emits visible light which travels back into the designator to provide an indication of the location of the spot impingement of the laser light on the target disk.
