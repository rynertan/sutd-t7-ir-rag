# Steering locking mechanisms.

## Abstract
A steering locking mechanism includes a housing containing a key operated device arranged to rotate with a cam 30 that serves to retract a spring loaded bolt upon insertion of a key and rotation thereof relative to the housing. The cam 30 is formed with a track 35 in which a slide element 31 is located, the slide element 31 being arranged to interact with the bolt and being slidable within a channel 36 in the housing. The mode of operation is such that the movements required to effect withdrawal of the key and displacement of the bolt into its locking position comprises rotation of the key and cam 30 from the ON position into the AUXILIARIES position, axial movement in the direction of key withdrawal to disengage the slide element 31 from the bolt, return axial movement of the cam 30 but not of the slide element 31 , and continued rotary movement of the cam 30 into the OFF position in which key withdrawal can be effected.

## Description
iris irivt ition rc ites to steering locking necharj z for motor ve ,icles and is concerned with that kind of mechanism which includes a housing containing a key operated device arranged to rotate with a cam which, in use, serves to effect retraction of a bolt against the action of a spring upon insertion of a correct key into the device and rotation of the key relative to the housing.It is an object of the invention to provide an improved steering locking mechanism of the kind specified.According to the invention there is provided a steering locking mechanism of the kind specified in which means are provided whereby, when the bolt is in its retracted position and the key is rotated in the direction corresponding to release of the bolt, rotation of the cam and device serves to bring the mechanism into an intermediate blocking condition beyond which further rotation of the device into a position in which withdrawal of the key can be effected is prevented, said blocking being releaseable by axial movement of the cam and device in the direction opposite to that in which the key is withdrawn.The cam preferably has a track in which a slide element is located, said slide element being slideable in a channel in the housing and axially displaceable, on rotation of the cam, between a position in which it acts to prevent movement of the bolt under the action of its spring loading and a position in which its does not so act.Tne construction is preferably such that, on insertion of the key and rotation of the cam, the cam acts to withdraw the bolt, whereafter the cam is moved into a position in which it arts to hold off the bolt against movement under the action of its spring, the mode of interaction between the track in the cam and the slide element being such as to move the slide element into a position in which it acts to prevent movement of the bolt and to stop return rotary movement of the cam in said intermediate blocking condition.Preferably, the arrangement is such that, prior to movement of the cam and device in the direction opposite to that in which the key is withdrawn, it is necessary to effect movement of the cam and slide element in the direction of key withdrawal. The movements required to effect withdrawal of the key and displacement of the bolt into its locking position thus preferably comprise rotÅatícyl of the key arjd cz. from the ON position into the AUt ILI An Its position, axial movement in the direction of key withdrawal to disengage the slide element from the bolt, return axial movement of the cam but not of the slide element, and continued rotary movement of the cam into the OFF position in which key withdrawal can be effected.The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a steering locking mechanism, Figure 2 is a sectional view of the mechanism along the lineA A of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a sectional view of the mechanism along the lineB B of Figure 1, Figure 4 is a sectional view of the mechanism housing along the lineC C of Figure 1, Figure 5 is an end view of a cam forming part of the mechanism, Figure 6 is a plan view of the cam, Figure 7 shows the other end of the cam, Figure 8 is a side view of the cam, Figure 9 illustrates the form of a track in the cam and its interaction with a slide element, Figure 10 is a side view of the slide element, and Figure 11 is a sectional view illustrating engagement of the slide element in a channel in the housing.The steering locking mechanism has a housing 10 which is formed as a diecasting frrm a zinebased alloy, housing 10 including a main body portion 11 of stepped cylindrical form and a tubular portion 12 within which a cam 30 and a key operated device are located. The axis of the tubular portion 12 is at right angles to and offset from the axis of the main body portion 11 which is fixedly attached to the vehicle steering column 14 by means of fasteners 15. Within the main body portion 11 there is an annular wall 16 which is provided, at its inner periphery, with a cylindrical lip 17 which affords a seating for a flanged bearing 18 that fits around and supports the vehicle steering shaft 19.As shcwn in Figures 1 to 3, the main body portion 11 includes a chamber within which an annular externally toothed element 20 is located by means of a fixing ring 21 fitted into the end of the chamber so as to abut against an internal shoulder 22 of the mzirj UDay portion 11 and against a collar 23 of the annular element 20. Keying mesle not shown act between the annular element 20 and the steering shaft 19 to prevent relative rotation therebetween, which keying means may take the form of a flat on the shaft and a complementary formation on the element 20.A bolt 24 acted on by a spring 25 is located within a bore 26, the spring 25 acting between a closure plate 27 and the bolt 24 to urge the bolt 2I1 towards the annular element 20 so that, when the orientation of the steering shaft 19 is such that a nose portion 28 of the bolt 24 is aligned with the space between two adjacent teeth on the annular element 20, said nose portion 28 will enter this space and a locking action will be obtained. The bolt 211 is of rectangular cross section but includes a shoulder 29 intermediate its ends such that the end of the bolt 24 acted on by the spring 25 is larger than the other end thereof.The shoulder 29 co operates with a cam 30 and with a slide element 31 in the manner described below in detail.In the locked condition of the mechanism, the cam 30 is in the position shown in Figure 3 and the spring 25 urges the bolt 24 into engagement with the toothed element 20. When, however, the key not shown is inserted and turned, the cam 30 is rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow 34 in Figure 3 and a lifting face 32 on the cam 30 engages the shoulder 29 to displace the bolt 24 against the action of the spring 25, the bolt 24 then being held in this position by a part cylindrical portion 33 of the cam profile.The mode of intersection of the bore 26 in which the bolt 211 is located and the chamber containing the toothed annular element 20 is such that a rebate is afforded in the cylindrical wall of said chamber to receive the nose portion 28 of the bolt 24. The bolt 24 is moved by the spring 23 in a direction parallel to the axis of the steering shaft 19 and the angle between two adjacent tooth faces is 920, i.e. 900 plus a clearance factor. The nose portion of the bolt 24 is thus located, in the locked condition, in a rebate of rectangular cross section with one corner thereof disposed between the two tooth faces and with the opposite corner thereof disposed between two wall surfaces of the main body portion which extend at substantially 90 to one another. Thus, if a torque is applied to the steering shaft 19 when the nose portion 28 of the bolt 24 is in its engaged or locked position, this torque will be transmitted via the annular element 20 of the nose portion 28 to effect compression of the nose portion 28 between one or other of said two tooth faces and the opposite wall surface of t ie main body portion 11. Since the nose portion is substantially solely in compression, it is able to withstand considerably greater loads than would be the case if it were subjected to shear loads or tensile loads. In addition, the point of engagement between the bolt 24 and the annular element 20 is at a greater spacing from the axis of the steering shaft 19 than the point of engagement between a bolt and a sleeve of a conventional steering column lock, thereby enabling an inherently stronger structure to be obtained.As shown in Figure 1, there are eighteen teeth on the element 20 at an angular spacing of 20 so that, if the bolt 24 is not initially aligned with the space between two adjacent teeth when the locking device is operated to return the cam 30 to the position shown in Figure 3, the spring 25 will act to urge the nose portion 28 of the bolt 24 continuously against the annular element 20 and engagement of the bolt 24 will be effected when the steering wheel is turned through, at most, 200. This is in contrast with conventional steering column locks in which the sleeve fixed to the steering shaft has a single hole such that locking can only be obtained when the front wheels of the vehicle are in a straight ahead position.Referring now to Figure 9, which shows the form of a track 35 in which the slide element 31 is located, the slide element 31 is disposed initially, i.e when the bolt 24 is in its extended position, in a position indicated at A at one end of a channel 36 formed in the wall of the tubular portion 12. When the key is inserted and the cam 30 is rotated, relative movement is effected between the cam 30 and slide element 31 with the cam 30 moving in the direction indicated in Figure 9 by the arrow r 7.During rotation of the cam 30 to effect withdrawal of the bolt 24, an inclined surface 37 of the cam 30 initially produces movement of the slide element 31 towards the bolt into the position indicated at C. Py the time that position C is reached, the lifting face 32 will have acted on the shoulder 29 to effect complete retraction of the bolt 24 which will then be held off, against return movement under the action of the spring 25, by its engagement with the cylindrical surface portion 33 of the cam 30.With continued rotation of the cam 30, the slide element 31 is engaged by a second inclined surface 38 of the cam 30 and the slide element 31 is moved into the position indicated at D in which it also then acts on the shoulder 29 to hold off the bolt 2 . athe cam 30 can then be turned to bring the vehicle electrical system into the ltON or START position, the cam 30 having a coupling portion 39 by which it is connected to a switch actuator and the cam 30 being located within the tubular portion 12 of the housing 10 by means of a retaining element 148. Throughout the above movements, the slide element 31 is retained in the channel 36 so that the movements of the slide element 31 relative to the housing 10 are purely linear movements. When the key is turned from the ON position towards the OFF position, the cam 30 moves relative to slide element 31 such that in the 11AUXILIARIES position, the slide element 31 abuts a shoulder 30 within the cam track 35 and further rotary movement of the cam 30 is prevented. To obtain continued rotary movement of the cam 30, the slide element 31 must be disengaged from the shoulders 29 and 40, the bolt being illustrated diagrammatically at B in Figure 9.The cam 30 must thus be moved first in the direction of key withdrawal, in the direction indicated by the arrow 141, to disengage from the shoulder 29 on bolt B and then in the opposite direction to disengage from the shoulder 40. During movement of the cam 30 in the direction of the arrow 141, a wall 42 of the track 35 physically displaces element 31 along the channel 36 in the housing.On the other hand, when the cam 30 is moved axially in the opposite direction, the slide element 31 remains stationary.In order to ensure that the slide element 31 does, in fact, remain stationary, the coefficient of sliding friction between the slide element 31 and the channel 36 must be considerably greater than the coefficient of sliding friction between the slide element 31 and the cam 30. This is ensured by making the slide element 31 of U shape in plan with two legs 43 and 44 which are resiliently biassed away from each other into gripping engagement with the side walls of the channel 36. In addition, a small protuberance may be provided at the end of arm 43 to increase the frictional grip that is obtained.When the cam 30 is displaced axially in the direction of key withdrawal, a projection within the housing enters a rebate 45 of the cam 30 to prevent rotation of the cam 30 relative to the housing in this axial position. Then, when the cam 30 is subsequently pressed in by means of the key this projection is disengaged from the rebate 45 and the slide element 31 is returned to the position indicated at C. When the cam 30 is rotated further, an inclined surface 46 of the cam 30 acts on the slide element 31 to return it to its original position indicated at A. This is the OFF or LOCK position in which the key can be withdrawn.As described, manual effort is required to effect outward axial movement of the cam 30 when the iey is turned into the intermediate blocking position described above. If desired, however, a s pring may be arranged to act on the cam 30 with the rating of the spring just sufficient to effect said outward axial movement of the cam. The load on the ward springs of the locking device is thus reduced.
