# Process for mixing and extruding ceramic materials.

## Abstract
Ceramic articles are made through extrusion utilizing a self cleaning intermeshing, co rotating, twin screw extrusion apparatus. Extrusion of honeycomb structures wherein the batch consists of cordierite or cordierite mullite composi tions with water and a hydroxy propyl cellulose binder plasticizer having a viscosity at 20 C in a 2 aqueous solution between 25,000 100,000 centipoises is a particular aspect of the invention. The viscosity of the hydroxypropyl cellulose is preferably at least 50,000 centipoises so as to permit a working temperature during operation of the extrusion apparatus of at least 40 C.
