# A process for producing coloured shaped articles.

## Abstract
A uniformly coloured shaped article which is resistant to discolouration and fading can be produced by immersing a shaped article, particularly a contact lens, consisting of a polymer of at least one monomer which is an acrylate and or methacrylate in a dyeing solution prepared by dissolving a water soluble dye in a solvent capable of swelling said polymer, to swell and colour the shaped article, and then drying the swollen shaped article.
