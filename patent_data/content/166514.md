# Terminal arrangement for a solenoid switch, solenoid for electrical starting apparatus and method of manufacturing the solenoid.

## Abstract
A starter solenoid 10 for electric starting apparatus and its method of manufacture. The solenoid has hold in and pull in coils 12, 14 and a cover 46 formed of insulating material that carries a start switch terminal 20 and a motor terminal 26 . Both terminals have axially extending internal bores 26A, 26B and when the cover is moved into engagement with the case 48 of the solenoid to secure it thereto end lead wires 28 of the coils are inserted into the bores of the terminals. The terminals are radially crimped into engagement with the wires and the crimped portions are then welded to the wires. The ground connection for one end of the hold in coil is made by in serting an end lead wire of the hold in coil into the bore of a hollow metallic terminal that is carried by a metallic plate mem ber 68 , crimping the terminal to the wire and then welding the crimped portion to the wire.
