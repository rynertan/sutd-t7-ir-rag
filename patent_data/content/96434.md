# Electric arc furnace electrodes.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a water cooled arc furance electrode comprising a double walled tubular metal column the two walls being electrically insulated from one another and defining an annular channel between them. The inner wall 2 is electrically connected to a conductive screw threaded member 10 from which graphite sections 18 depend, and this inner tube defines a central channel constituting a water flow path connected in series with the annular channel via a spider 14 in the aforesaid member. In accordance with this design the volume of water con tained within the electrode column approaches the max imum, ensuring adequate cooling during electrode changes which hitherto has presented problems in other designs of this component.
