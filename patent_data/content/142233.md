# RHOMBIC AERIALS

## Abstract
A rhombic aerial has two rigid conductive arms 10, 12 bent to form a rhombus. At one end the arms 10, 12 are connected together by a rigid interconnection 16, 18, 20 whilst conductive extensions 10c, 12c extend from the other ends of the arms 10, 12 . A co axial cable 28 enters one extension 12c and extends within that extension 12c to a point at which its outer conductor is connected to one arm 12 and its inner conductor is connected to the other arm 10 . The extensions 10c, 12c are electrically connected by a movable slide 34 so that they form a balun. This enables the reactance of the aerial to be tuned to match the feed cable. Preferably the position of the slide 34 is adjustable so that the aerial may be tuned to a particular frequency band. The extensions may extend outwardly of the rhombus or may extend inwardly e.g. from one end of an arm to the other.
