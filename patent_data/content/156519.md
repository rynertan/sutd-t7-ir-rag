# Profiled sheet material.

## Abstract
The profiled sheet material is formed into side panels and floor or deck panels for use for example in the manu facture of high sided lorries, trailers and containers. The profiled sheet material 10 has a plurality of parallel deformations 11 which in cross section are substantially triangular with the base 12 of each deformation spaced from the body of the sheet. The apex of each deformation is formed by closely abutting curved faces of the sheet material 10 where the body of the sheet material is bent into the defor mation. Floor or deck plates incorporate strips of timber 50 whose longitudinal faces are tapered. These are located be tween adjacent pairs of deformations 11 with the tapered faces abutting the respective sides 42, 43 of the deforma tions. A series of indents 41 are also formed along the length of the web 12 of the U formation. The U formation is then deformed by pressing the tops of both limbs 42, 43 inwardly towards each other to form a triangular formation.
