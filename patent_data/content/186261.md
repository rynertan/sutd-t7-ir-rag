# Friction material and carrier plate assembly.

## Abstract
A friction material and carrier plate assembly 2 which may be used in the construction of a driven plate for a friction clutch comprises a metal carrrier plate 4 having integral, planar, radial spokes 12 adhesively bonded and or riveted to the bases of recesses 26 in one radial friction face 22 in a one piece annulus 20 of friction material, the face 22 being proud of the spokes. The assembly is centered on axis X and the annulus 20 and spokes 12 can flex axially.
