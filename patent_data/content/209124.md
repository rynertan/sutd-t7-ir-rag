## Description
This invention relates to a plastic lens as claimed in Claim 1, having a high refractive index of not less than 1.55 and excellent properties in visible light transmission, processability, impact resistance, and dyeability. Plastic lenses have become widely used in optical instruments, since they are lighter in weight, less fragile and more readily colored in comparison with inorganic glass lenses. Especially, in the case of eyeglass lenses, light weight lenses are desirable, because the total weight of a pair of lenses is important from both physiologic and optical viewpoints. This is one of the main reasons for the recent widespreading tendency of plastic lenses. The leading resin used for eyeglass lenses is a polymer of diethylene glycol bis allylcarbonate commonly called CR 39, Trademark for PPG Industries Co. . Since the specific gravity of the above polymer 1.32 is smaller than that of inorganic glass lenses 2.54 , it is possible to reduce to a great extent the weight of lenses when this polymer is used. The above polymer, however, has a refractive index of 1.49 to 1.50 which is smaller than that n Polycarbonate n The proposed methods for providing three dimensionally crosslinked plastic lens materials having high refractive indices include those which employ as major constituents 1 diacrylate or dimethacrylate derived from bisphenol A Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open No. 13,747 80 , 2 diacrylate or dimethacrylate derived from halogenated bisphenol A Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open No. 104,901 82 , 3 a combination of a halogenated styrene monomer and a polyfunctional methacrylate Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open Nos. 104,101 82, 28,118 82, and 28,116 82 , and 4 a diallyl phthalate monomer Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open Nos. 212,401 82 and 15,513 83 . However, the method 1 provides with difficulty three dimensionally crosslinked plastics having a refractive index of not less than 1.55. The methods 2 , 3 and 4 provide three dimensionally crosslinked plastics having a high refractive index of not less than 1.60, but these plastics have faults of their easy discoloration and unsatisfactory weatherability. The plastics obtained by the method 4 have not only the fault of discoloration but also a low transmittance. In general, methods using compounds containing a meth acryloyl group and styrene monomers are disadvantageous in that said compounds contain polymerization inhibitors and are difficult to alleviate discoloration of the cured products caused by said inhibitors during the cast polymerization. The purpose of the present invention is to provide three dimensionally crosslinked plastic lenses having a high refractive index without any aforementioned defects. The problems mentioned hereinafter can be solved by using a polymer comprising as major component at least one radical polymerizable biphenyl compound represented by the general formula I wherein each R represents a hydrogen atom or methyl group, has a high refractive index and is satisfactory in visible light transmission, grinding processability, and impact resistance. On the basis of this finding, the present invention has been accomplished. Concrete examples of the radical polymerizable biphenyl compound of the general formula I used in this invention include biphenyl 2,2 diallyl ester, biphenyl 2,2 dimethallyl ester, biphenyl 3,3 diallyl ester, biphenyl 3,3 dimethallyl ester, biphenyl 4,4 diallyl ester, biphenyl 4,4 dimethallyl ester. These monomers can be used alone or as a mixture thereof. Said monomers have a number of features. First, they can be purified by distillation and can be stored for a long term without addition of a polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone or the like. Second, their polymerization shrinkage is 7.8 which is considerably smaller than that about 14 of diethylene glycol Bis allylcarbonate hereinafter referred to as CR 39 . Third, the specific gravity of their cured products is 1.24 which is considerably smaller than that 1.32 of cured product of CR 39. These features are very advantageous for production of optical lenses. The first feature enables the monomers to provide lens materials excellent in visible light transmission and free of discoloration. The second feature makes it possible to provide more precisely molded articles by cast polymerization than the case with CR 39, namely, to produce lenses of complicated shape in high production yield. The third feature enable the monomers to give lenses lighter in weight than those produced from CR 39. The plastic lenses according to the present invention can be produced by polymerizing one of or a mixture of the biphenyl diallyl esters and or biphenyl dimethallyl esters represented by the above general formula I , in a mold. It is also possible to copolymerize the above mentioned monomers with other monomers in order to further improve the performance characteristics. Concrete examples of the comonomers include diethylene glycol bis allylcarbonate ,diallyl o phthalate, diallyl isophthalate, diallyl terephthalate, dimethallyl o phthalate, dimethallyl isophthalate, dimethallyl terephthalate, phenyl meth acrylate, benzyl meth acrylate, phenoxyethyl meth acrylate, styrene, vinyltoluene, halogenated styrene, etc. Among them, monomers selected from the group II consisting of diethylene glycol bis allylcarbonate and dimethallyl phthalate are especially suitable for improving the characteristics of the lens materials. When diethylene glycol bis allylcarbonate is copolymerized, the resulting lens has further improved impact resistance and dyeability though it has a somewhat lowered refractive index. When dimethallyl phthalate is copolymerized, the dyeability becomes excellent, generation of heat of polymerization can be depressed, the moldability is improved, and a lens excellent in optical properties can be obtained. The term dimethallyl phthalate as herein used, means dimethallyl o phthalate, dimethallyl isophthalate, or dimethallyl terephthalate. When these monomers are copolymerized, it is desirable to mix 60 to 90 by weight of at least one biphenyl compound represented by the above general formula I and 40 to 10 by weight of at least one monomer selected from the group II , and subject the resulting mixture to cast polymerization. When the comonomer is used in an amount of more than 40 by weight, the resulting lens has a lowered refractive index, and in the case, when the comonomer is dimethallyl phthalate, the impact resistance is also lowered. When the amount of the comonomer is less than 10 by weight, the dyeability of the lens is lowered and thus the copolymerization does not have the effect described above. The radical polymerization initiator used in practicing this invention is not critical and there can be used well known organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, tert butyl peroxyisobutyrate, 1,1 di tert butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane, bis 4 tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate and the like and azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile and the like. The radical polymerization initiator is used preferably in an amount in the range of from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the radical polymerizable biphenyl compound or the sum of said biphenyl compound and the comonomer. This invention is concretely illustrated with reference to the following examples, in which all parts are by weight. In 100 parts of biphenyl 2,2 diallyl ester having a refractive index of 1.5678 at 20 C synthesized from allyl chloride and potassium biphenyl 2,2 dicarboxylate was dissolved 3 parts of diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate. The resulting mixture was poured into a mold composed of glass members for molding a lens of 65 mm in diameter and a polyethylene gasket. The filled mold was held in a hot blast stove at 40 C for 20 hours, then at 80 C for 4 hours, and finally at 100 C for 4 hours. Then, the polymer thus obtained was taken out of the mold and its refractive index, visible light transmission, pencil hardness, grinding processability, and dyeability were measured. The results obtained were as shown in Table 1. The polymer obtained was in the form of colorless, transparent lens having a refractive index of 1.603.
