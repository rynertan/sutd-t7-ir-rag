# SPIN TEXTURE PROCESS

## Abstract
A spin texture process for producing crimped synthetic filaments is described in which freshly extruded filaments are passed over a 20 180 C roll before they are completely solidified and fully drawn as they leave the roll. In the case of polyamide filaments, spontaneous crimp as well as latent crimp is observed.
