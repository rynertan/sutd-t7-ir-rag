# Plasmid pOA15.

## Abstract
A plasmid pOA15 in isolated form having the property of conferring pock forming ability on Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137 and a molecular length of about 10 kb, and showing such sensitivity that a it has one restriction site recognized by BamHI, b it has one restriction site recognized by EcoRi, c it has 7 restriction sites recognized by SaII, and d it is not cleaved by BgIII, HindIII, KpnI, PstI and XbaI, and a biologically pure culture of a microorganism containing the above plasmid.
