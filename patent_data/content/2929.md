# Use of plain low carbon steels for electrical applications.

## Abstract
Molten steel is deoxidized while it is being tapped into a receiving vessel by sequentially adding at least three separate deoxidizing agents such as manganese, silicon and aluminum in order of increasing deoxidizing strength. The additions are suitably spaced to allow each to mix and react before the next addition is made. The resulting steel has superior magnetic properties.
