# PIPE CUTTER DEVICE

## Abstract
The pipe milling or cutter device comprises spindle frame 8 restrained from rotating with respect and associated to a rod 1 which is locked onto a pipe T being machined, the cutting tool 37 being carried on the spindle 17 with the interposition of a carriage 33 operative to provide automatic radial feed features. Thus, the cutting reaction couple generated on the spindle frame 8 is balanced without resorting to outside actions, thereby the possibility is afforded of cutting large thickness pipes.
