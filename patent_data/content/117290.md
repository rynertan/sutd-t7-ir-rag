# Fuel cell catalysts.

## Abstract
Fuel cell catalysts which are efficient, long lived, and refurbishable in situ include gold carrying a UPD under potential deposited deposit of another element. UPD Ag, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, or Tl, Pb, Bi is formed on Au crystallites which are carried on and bonded to the surfaces of substrate carbon particles. The crystallites cause dissociative adsorption of the oxygen molecules so that four electrons are produced per molecule during the reduction reaction which is invol ved. In an alkaline electrolyte, the catalyst metals such as Pd, Ir, Ag, Rh and Pt show no tendency to poison the counter electrode counter relative to the other electrode since each of those metals is a good catalyst for both electrodes. Suitable fuels include methanol CH‚ÇÉOH , formaldehyde HCHO , and formic acid HCOOH .
