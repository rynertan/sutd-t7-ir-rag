# Burner for reduced NOx emission and control of flame length and spread.

## Abstract
A burner for reduced NOx emission and also for the control of the shape of the flame as regards its length and spread, comprises a first combustion zone 20 , which is contained within a cylindrical chamber 22 lined with refractory material 24 . A burner tube 36 is inserted through an opening 28 in the upstream end of the first combustion zone 20 , the burner including means for providing and burning liquid and gaseous fuel. A first air plenum 14 is provided upstream of the first combustion zone 20 with means for supplying less than stoichiome tric combustion air in a tangential swirling manner, prior to entering the first combustion zone. A second air ple num 16 is provided coaxial with and surrounding the first combustion zone and tertiary air 72 is supplied tan gentially to this air plenum so that the tertiary air will flow in a helical swirling motion along the outside of the first combustion chamber 20 , around the downstream end of the combustion chamber and will meet and mix with the hot products of combustion from the first com bustion chamber. Control of the shape of the flame is provided by controlling the relative directions of tangen tial flow of air in the two plena.
