# Process for loading platinum into zeolite L .

## Abstract
A process is provided for loading and uniformly distri buting platinum onto a Zeolite L. The Zeolite L is contacted with an aqueous solution containing a platinum salt and a non platinum metal salt, wherein the non platinum metal salt is present in solution in an amount which is critical to preventing the formation of acid sites as well as avoiding an excess of metal ions in the form of a salt which could block the pores of the Zeolite L. The Zeolite L is then aged to allow the platinum to migrate and uniformly distribute throughout the Zeolite.
