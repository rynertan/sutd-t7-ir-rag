# GRINDING WHEEL

## Abstract
A grinding wheel including an abrasive portion of diamond abrasive grits, or cubic boron nitride grits bonded in a metal matrix, said matrix consisting of a metallic phase and optionally up to 50 by volume of a dispersed particulate lubricant filler, said metal phase consisting essentially of a hot pressed mixture of finely particulate 5 to 30 by volume aluminum, 10 to 35 by volume zinc, 20 to 70 by volume copper, and 5 to 30 by volume tin. The abrasive elements produced are particularly useful to form cup wheels for the dry grinding of carbide and tool steel.
