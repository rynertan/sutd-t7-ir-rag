# Method of generating energy.

## Abstract
A method of generating energy in which working fluid fractions of differing compositions are generated, are subjected to heating in a first evaporator stage 68 , are combined, the combined stream is then evaporated 70 and is expanded 50.1 to convert its energy into usable form. Thereafter the combined stream is processed to regenerate the differing working fluid fractions for reuse.
