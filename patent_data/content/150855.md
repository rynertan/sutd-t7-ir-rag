## Description
Ionizing lightning conductor The present invention relates to lightning conductors for the effective protection of buildings, and makes use of the phenomenon of atmospheric electric field atmospheric corona and its subsequent effects, where this phenomenon appears in suitably insulated conductive bodies when storm conditions prevail to obtain increased ionization at the space surrounding the lightning point. It is well known from the theory and practice of electricity that the atmosphere shows a small conductivity due to the existence of ions within it. This ionization is caused by either the ultra violet radiation of the sun, or by cosmic radiation or by electritrical phenomena or because of the existence of underground radioactive substances. Thereby, an atmospheric electric field is produced, the intensity of which measured on the ground is of the order of 100 V m. with a dovaiw ds direction, provided tbe ether is good.In cloud weathert the clouds other ed at a height of I000 I500 m above the ground tend to de velop a negative electric. charge on their bottom sur face , thereby charging positively the opposing 6round of the earth. Thus a strong electric field of the order of 9 KVPm up to 20 KV m is produced between the earth and the cloud in a storm situation. The discharge of the lightning bolt is the natural consequency of the increase of field intensity to the above values. The process of discharge starts when a tracer comes out of the cloud advancing in a direction towards the earth. This first tracer stops after having run a small distance of the order of I0 I00 m and it is followed by a new charge, which following the path of the first tracer advances towards the earth at the same speed and stops after having run a similar further distance.The above phenomenon continues and the tracer moves towards the earth at an average speed of I000 iL SEC. When the initial tracer, which is also called leader tracer,reaches a certain distance from the ground, another tracer, preferably produced by a natural or artifici cause, leaves the ground with an upwards direction to meet the first tracer. Then the main discharge occurs during thi ch the electric charge of the ground tends to neutralise the charge of the cloud. Morn technology uses the lightning conductors as points of preferemce for the fall of lightning bolts, which by seizing the lightning bolts offer an effective protection to the surrounding space. An object of the present invention is to provide an Ionizing lightning conductor, which will make use of the atmospheric electric field its elf and of no other additional source of energy for the creation of ioniza t ion. Another object of the invention is the creation of electric voltages by means of special arrangements of accumulation of atmospheric electric charge at the top of the lightning conductor, this resulting in a further increase of ionization. Another final object of tile invention is to provide a lightning conductor with the above advantages , which will be of simple and economic construction with a hi gh strength and functional effectiveness. These and other objects, chamoteristics and advan tae of te present invention will be made clear and obvious in the following analytical description of one preferred embodiment of the invention. before doing tis a review of the prior art relating to lightning conductors has to be made. The usage of lieRtnin conductors begins with the Franklin rod which ends onto a point and.it is mounted on the highest point of the building under p rotection. This rod causes de fonnation of the equipotential parallel horizontal lines of te atmospheric electric field and their packing around the top point of the rod. This leads into a local increase in the value of the electric field and this makes the rod a point of prefeience for the discharge of the lightning bolt.Since this first attempt, many efforts have been made to increase ionization around the highest point of the lightning conductor, this resulting in a reduction of the air resistance acd in an increase of te lightning conductors effectiveness probabilities of seizure of the lightning bolt as well as in an increase of its zone of protection . ihis attempt to increase ionization with the subsequent beneficial results has up to de found many applications , being realised in different ways. Thus a method o increasing ionization is to use an arti ficial radiation source , such as for example alpha , r gamma ra dioactive particles, etc. The ionization obtained in thais way is higher compared to that obtained using a Franklin rod . Bevertheless the usage of radioactive . elements causes dangers and therefore a high cost of taking the ne cessary precaution measures which are in many cases enforced by law. Another method of increase of ionization is the usage of the corona phenomenon by applying a voltage of 20 KV or higher at the top of the lightning conducto r. Based on this phenomenon many 4 lightning conductors have been produced , which use an additional power supply to raise the voltage . tis, however, leads to an operational energy cost ana to an increased installation cost.moreover, there is always a danger that this additional power supply is not activated at the right moment because of possible mlfunction of the signalling and acti sating mechanism. These and other disadvantage and shortconiings of the prior art are effectively overcome with te present invention. An illustrative preferred embodiment of the invention is analytically described below The invention will be described by reference to the accompanying drawing which slows a view of an illustrative, preferred esubotiment of the invention, which airs to aid a better understanding of the proposed product of hhe invention by those skilled in the art. The present invention makes use of a conductive body T of any form such as for example disc, ring, cy linder , sphere , sharp point , etc., which aan be made from any suitable , desired conductive material, where the said conductive body I is mounted at the upper part of the lightning rod at a suitable position onto an insulator 2.The insulator 2 is made from any desired and suitable insula ting material , such as for example porcelain, epoxy resin, etc., where the selected m zrial must have a high dielectric strength so that it may withstand the high atmospheric voltaxes without producing an ercinb leakage. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention onto one of the sides of the insulator 2 , and according t another prefered embodiment of the invention onto both sides of the insulator 2, there are mounted earthed, conductive surfaces 3 which can be made from any suitable m erial and can have any desired shape similar or different to the shape of the conductive surfaces I.A gap 4 is left in between each pair of conductive surfaces I and 3 . the gap 4 can be adgusted during the installation of the lightning condoctor and it is obvious that when the height of the ar rangements of the lightning conductor is increased.,, this incr easing also the height at which corona phenomenon ta , es place, the gap has to be larger. The gap 4 is adjusted in a manner such as to allow the development of cn electric arc between the conductive surfaces I and 3 as the voltage is increased, this leadin.. to a further increase of ioniza tion by collision. it has already been mentioned that the operation of the lightning conductor of the present invention is based in the exploitation of the atzospheric electric field. If we assume tat the intensity of the atmospheric electric field is 8 KV m3 and that the top of te lightning conductor is situated at a height of 3 m above any earthed pon struction, then the potential difference applied between the two above conductive surfaces is 24 KV and thus the corona phenomenon appears.It must hereby be noted that in order to obtainEMI7.1 increase of ionization any additional, artificial or na tural ionization source can be used, such as for example electrical source, radiation source , etc. Due to the increase of ionization obtained from the exploitation of the atmospheric electric field, the air re sistarce is reduced and this brings about an increase of the speed of the tracer leaving the earth to meet te initial tracer . eventually a rise of the point of meeting of the two tracers is obtained, which obviously provides an increased zone of protection of the lightning conductor. The invented lightning conductor can have one or more seizure points 5 or none, where inthe latter case the seizure of the lightning, bolt is performed by means of the auxiliary ionization parts, i.e. te insulated or earthed surfaces. It must hereby be noted that the present invention has been described by reference to a merely illustrative example , to which the invention is not limited. Thus any change or amendment relating to the form and number of the arrangements of the lightning conductor, the shape, size , materials, and accessories used in its construction, where such change or amendinent can affect the performance parameters of the invented lightning conductor, must be considered as being contained in the scope and the aim of the present invention provided that it does not entail a ne inventive step and does not comprise a development of the state Oi the art.
