# Nonlinearity correction circuit for bandgap reference.

## Abstract
A curvature correction circuit for generating an output current of the general form TlnT. When applied as a curvature correcton circuit to bandgap reference, the circuit precisely offsets the inherent parabolic non linearity of such circuits.
