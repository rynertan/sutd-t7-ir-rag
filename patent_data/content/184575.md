# Transformed yeasts producing lysozyme, plasmids used for this transformation, and uses thereof.

## Abstract
Transformed yeasts are disclosed, such that the DNA thereof comprises at least one copy of a fragment coding for a 1,4 Î² N acetylmuramidase and that said fragment is ex pressed therein as the corresponding active protein. A process for preparing lysozyme by growing said transformed yeasts is also disclosed.
