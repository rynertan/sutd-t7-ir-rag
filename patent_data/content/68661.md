# MICROENCAPSULATED CHOLESTERIC LIQUID CRYSTAL TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICE FOR DETERMINING THE TEMPERATURE OF NON PLANAR OR PLANAR SURFACES

## Abstract
A temperature measuring device engageable with a surface of any contour to determine the temperature of each of the several portions of the surface by pro viding a thermal map of the portions of the surface engaged. The surface engaged by the device may be a portion of a person or a portion of an object or the like. The map is observable and may be photographed if a record thereof is desired. The temperature measuring device has a flexible portion 20 engageable with the surface and conform able to the surface. The portion 20 which engages the surface includes a coating 24 of cholesteric material, such as microencapsulated liquid crystal material which is temperature sensitive and light reflecting. The device also includes a transparent fill material 30 therewithin to transmit the thermal image or map therethrough. Thus, a thermal map or image of the surface is provided which is observable and or recordable through a trans parent portion 28 of the device.
