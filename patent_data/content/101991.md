## Description
The present invention concerns intermediates for the product ion of new insecticide and acaricides belonging to the class of pyrethroids.These new compounds have the general formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 F, C1, Br, CH3, CF3 2R F Cl, Br, CF3 R6 H1 F, Cl, Br R7 and R81 equal to or different from each other, alkyl or haloalkyl with C1 C4, or R7 and R8 together constitute aEMI1.2 group or aEMI1.3 group, provided that when R1 t CH3, R will be different from C1.The new compounds may be prepared by the following reactions 1 to 8EMI1.4 EMI2.1 In the above reported reaction R1, Rr R6, R7 and RB, if notj otherwise indicated, have the meanings reported for formulaI X stands for chlorine or bromine while NBS indicates N bromo succinimide. Reactions from 1 to 4 represent examples of methods for the preparation of the corn pounds of formula I wherein R6 H. The compounds whereinR6 halogen, may be prepared in a similar way starting from suitable 2 alkenyl halides, or they may be prepared from the compounds of formula I wherein R H, by the methods illustrated by reactions from 5 to 8. All starting compounds of reaction 1 to 4 are known compounds or they can be easily prepared according to known methods. Reaction 5 concerns a standard halogenation in allylic position, carried out with N bromo succinimide. Reactions 6 to 8 represent an alternative to reaction 5, also useful for preparing compounds in which R6 Cl.The addition of halogen X2 to compounds I wherein R6 N reaction 6 is carried out according to techniques that are standard in organic chemistry, using halogens or halogenating agents such as SO2Cl2. The dehydrohalogenation of adduct III reaction7 may be carried out either in the presence of inorganic bases or of organic bases such as secondary or tertiary amines. The reaction of the re arrangement of adducts IV reaction 8 is a new one and as such forms a further object of this invention. Said reaction accours quantitatively at a temperature comprised between 200 and 1500C, in the presence of catalytic quantities of a bivalent copper halide, by simple stirring of the mixture consisting of the adduct IV and of cupric halide. In case X Cl, a suitable catalyst is cupric chloride in the commonly used form of dihydrate.The new intermediates are.useful in the preparation of valuable insecticides and acaricides of the pyrethroid series.The new insecticides have the general formula A EMI4.1 wherein R1 F, C1, Br, CH3, CF3, R2 F, C1, Br, CF3, R6 H, F, Cl, Br,EMI4.2 in which R5 H, CN, C CH. The new insecticides A were prepared starting from the new intermediates by reacting in the presence of a strong base a 2 alkene phosphonate of the above mentioned formula IEMI4.3 wherein the residues R1, R3, R6, R7 and R8 are defined as above, with a lower alkylester of caronic aldehyde V 2,2 dimethyl 3 formyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid of the formula EMI4.4 wherein R O alkyl C1 c, The above process, is illustrated by reaction 9 EMI5.1 The compounds of formula I have been indicated as phosphonates, thereby using this term in its more general meaning, that is, referred to organic compounds of the pentavalent phosphorus in which there is present a carbon phosphorus bond.It must, however, be pointed out that the correct nomenclature for the compounds of formula I in which substi tuents R7 and R8 tuents R and R together represent either a EMI5.2 or aEMI5.3 group and thus form with theEMI5.4 group either a pentastomic or hexaatomic ring foresees for these compounds the term 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphospholane and respectively 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxa phosphorinane. In this context, the compounds of formula I will in the following be indicated by the term phosphonates , also comprising thereby the compounds of formula I in which there occurs either a penta or hexatomic ring. As far as we know, only one example of a reaction between a 2 alken phosphonate and an aldehyde was known from the literature. Said example concerns the reaction between methyl 3 chloro 2 butene phosphonate and benzaldehyde tG. Lavielle, C.R.Acad. Sci., Ser. C, 86 1970 5. The above cited reaction leads to the formation of three products, only one of them having a dienic structure EMI6.1 It had thus to be expected that also from reaction9 there would form compounds of little interest for the purpo ses of the desired structure. On the contrary, we surprisingly found that reaction 9 affords compounds of formula A with high yields and allows to separate isolate the desired product quite easily and with a high degree of purity. Reaction 9 is carried out using substantially equimolar quantities of phcsphonate I and of the ester of caronic aldehyde V , in the presence of substantially eaiiro1 lar amounts of a strong base, in an inert solvent or diluent and at temperatures comprised between 50 C and 1000C, but preferably comprised betwecn 30 C and room temperature, Suitable strong bases may be hydrides or hydroxides of alkaline metals such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. In case that as a base there is used sodium hydride, it is preferable to operate in the presence of catalytic amounts of suitable activators such as for instance ethyl alcohol or imidazole. As a reaction medium there may be used an ether such as for instance dimethoxy ethane or tetrahydrofurane, an aprotic polar solvent such asN,N dimethyl formamide or a pair of protic aprotic solvents such as e.g.water and an aromatic hydrocarbon in this latter case, as a base there must be used an alkaline hydroxide . In a practical embodiment, the reaction 9 may be conducted by preparing a mixture of phosphonate I and of the ester of caronic aldehyde V j in a molar ratio of about 1 l and by then admixing slowly this mixture to a solution or a suspension of the base in a suitable inert solvent. In another practical form of embodiment, reaction 9 is conducted by slowly admixing a solution of phosphonate I in an inert solvent to a mixture consisting of the base, of the ester of caronic aldehyde V and of an inert solvent. Reaction 9 , in general, iscarried out in an anhydrous medium and under an atmosphere of an inert gas when a base there is used an alkaline metal hydride. The lower alkyl esters of caronic aldehyde U are known compounds that are separable in two isomeric forms, cis and trans isomerism on the cyclopropane ring . The possibility to use in reaction 9 also only just one of the two cis or trans forms, allows to obtain cyclopropanecarboxylic esters q having the corresponding isomerism. As far as is known to us, the only 2 alkene phosphonate of formula I known previously, is methyl 3 chloro 2 butene phosphonate reaction 10 . .The thus obtained esters A are then converted into the corresponding acyl halides, and the obtained acyl halides are reacted with alcohols of the general formula VI EMI8.1 wherein R5 has the above meaning.The preparation is carried out by methods known in the art, e.g by saponification of the ester into the free acid and reacting the acid with thionyl chloride Also the esterification of the acid halides with the alcohols VI is carried out by usual methods. The compounds of general formula A, in general, are obtained as mixtures of geometrical and configurational isomers due to the particular structure of the molecule which contains asymmetric carbon atoms and double bonds. The separation of the various mixtures in the various diastereoisomers may be achieved following the techniques usually applied in the normal practice of organic chemistry such as for instance chromatographic methods.In oder to even further illustrate this invention, in the following are given a number of examples.
