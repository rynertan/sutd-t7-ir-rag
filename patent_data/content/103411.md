# OPTICAL FIBER COMMUNICATION CABLES AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ASSEMBLING SAME

## Abstract
An individually armoured fiber optic core assembly 10 having a diameter not greater than 0.050 1.72 mm is provided as well as a process for making same. A fiber optic core 11 comprising a fiber optic element 12 and a surrounding protec tive layer 13 is encased within a drawn metal sheath 14 having a generally longitudinally extending seam 15 . The ratio of the outside diameter of the fiber optic core 11 to the inside diameter of the metal sheath 14 is at least about 0.6 1. The fiber is formed by drawing metal strip 32 through a die 36 and simultaneously laying the core into the sheath as it is formed by the die. Optionally the sheath can be sealed by a line of solder applied along the length of the seam. Fiber optic cables comprising a plurality of individual fibers according to the invention are also described.
