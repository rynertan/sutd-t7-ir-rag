## Description
ACTIVE COMPOUNDSThe present invention relates to novel compounds useful in the treatment and or prophylaxis of disorders relating to the gastro intestinal function, to a process for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.U.S. Patent No. 3912743 discloses 3 substituted l alkyl 4 phenylpiperidine derivatives and U.S. Patent No. 4007196 discloses further derivatives including the compound, t trans 4 4 fluorophenyl 3 324 methylenedioxy phenoxymethyl piperidine, commonly known as paroxetine , and processes by which they can be prepared. The compounds are described in the patents as inhibitors of 5 hydroxytryptamine uptake and, therefore, are of use in the treatment of depression.The patents also mention that the compounds are useful in the treatment of Parkinson s disease.A group of novel piperidine derivatives has now been discovered and these compounds have activity against disorders relating to damaged gastro intestinal tissue and to impaired gastro intestinal motility. Examples of disorders relating to damaged gastro intestinal tissue include peptic ulcers, such as gastric and duodenal ulcers. Examples of disorders relating to impaired gastro intestinal motility include retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux and peptic ulcer. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 are both hydrogen or together are a bond R3 and R4 are independently optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl groups R5 is a group CH2 nR6 wherein n is 1 or 2 and R6 is an optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl group.R1 and R2 are preferably both hydrogen.Suitable optional phenyl or naphthyl substituents inR3, R4 and R6 include one, two or three groups independently selected from halogen, CF3, C16 alkoxy, C16 alkylthio, C16 alkyl, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, hydroxy, C16 alkoxycarbonyl, C1 10 carboxylic acyl, and amino optionally substituted by one or two C1 6 alkyl groups, disubstituted by C36 polymethylene optionally containing oxygen, sulphur or NR7 wherein R7 is hydrogen or C16 alkyl, or monosubstituted by C14 alkanoyl or R3, R4 and or R6 is are disubstituted on adjacent carbon atoms by methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, C35 polymethylene or CH CH CH2 2 . Examples of the above substituents include fluoro, chloro, bromo, CF3, methoxy, ethoxy, n and iso propoxy, methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, hydroxy, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, n and iso propoxycarbonyl, formyl, acetyl, propionyl, amino optionally substituted by one or two methyl groups, disubstituted by C4 or C5 polymethylene or substituted by acetyl.Favourably R3 is phenyl monosubstituted by halogen, preferably 4 fluoro, or methoxy, such as 2 methoxy.Favourably R4 is phenyl 3,4 disubstituted by methylenedioxy, or R4 is 2 methoxyphenyl.Favourably R5 is CH2R6 and R6 is unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl monosubstituted by nitro or halo, preferably 4 substituted, in particular 4 fluorophenyl.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I include acid addition salts with acids, such as the conventional pharmaceutically acceptable acids, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, maleic, phosphoric, acetic, fumaric, malonic, salicylic, citric, lactic, mandelic, tartaric and methanesulphonic internal salts such as N oxides and quaternary ammonium salts with alkyl, phenylalkyl and cycloalkyl halides. Examples of quaternising agents include methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, benzyl, phenethyl chlorides, bromides and iodides. The compounds of formula I have at least one asymmetric centre indicated by in formula I and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different isomeric forms may be separated one from the other by conventional techniques or any given isomer may be obtained by a stereospecific synthesis.The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I which process comprises reacting a compound of formula II EMI4.1 wherein L is a leaving group or OR4 R8 is hydrogen when L is OR4 or CH2 nR6 when L is a leaving group and RI, R2 and R3 are as defined in formula I with i R6 CH2 nQ wherein Q is a leaving group when R8 is hydrogen or ii R4 OH or an alkali metal salt thereof when L is a leaving group and thereafter optionally converting substituents inR3, R4 and or R6 to other substituents in R3, R4 and orR6 and or forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.The group Q in R6 CH2 nQ is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Suitable values for Q include halogen, preferably chloro.The reaction may take place under conventional conditions for nucleophilic displacements using amines. Suitable conditions include using an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or acetone together with a base such as potassium carbonate at a temperature of 0 to 500C, preferably at ambient temperature.Preferably the alkali metal salt of R4OH is the sodium salt.The group L in formula II when a leaving group is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile.Examples of such groups are hydroxy, halogen such as chloro and bromo or a sulphonate, such as methyl sulphonate, ethyl sulphonate or p toluenesulphonate or benzenesulphonate.If the leaving group is a halide or sulphonate, then the reaction is preferably carried out at a non extreme temperature in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, dimethylformamide, toluene or diethyl ether.It may also be carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as the solvent. Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate.The leaving group L may also be an activated phosphate formed by the reaction of diethylazidodicarboxylate and triphenyl phosphine with the corresponding compound wherein L is OH. The reaction preferably takes place in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature from ambient to reflux.Alternatively the reaction may take place in the presence of a condensation promoting agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, when L is hydroxy, optionally in the presence of a mineral acid or a metal ion, such as copper it . The reaction may take place under conventional conditions. The skilled man will appreciate that the choice or necessity of conversion of groups R3, R4 and or R6 to other groups R3, R4 and or R6 will be dictated by the nature and position of substituents on R3, R4 and R6.It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an R3, R4 or R6 group which is convertible to another R3, R4 or R6 group are useful novel intermediates. A number of such conversions is possible not only for the end compounds of formula I but also for their intermediates as follows a an hydrogen substituent is convertible to a nitro substituent by nitration b a nitro substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by reduction c a C14 alkanoylamino substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by deacylation d an amino substituent is convertible to a C14 alkanoylamino substituent by acylation and e a hydrogen substituent is convertible to a halogen substituent by halogenation.Conversions a to e , are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities.In reagard to a , nitration is carried out in accordance with known procedures.In regard to b , the reduction is carried out with a reagent suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole.In regard to c , deacylation is carried out by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide.In regard to d , the acylation is carried out with an acylating agent, such as the corresponding acid or acid chloride or acid anhydride. Formylation is carried out with the free acid or its mixed anhydride.In regard to e , halogenation is carried out with conventional halogenating agents. The invention further provides novel intermediates within formula II , of formula III , and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof EMI8.1 wherein Rg is 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl and R10 is 4 fluorophenyl or Rg is 4 fluorophenyl and R10 is phenyl, 4 fluorophenyl, 2 methoxyphenyl, 4 methylphenyl, 3 trifluoromethylphenyl or Rg is phenyl, 2 methoxyphenyl or 2 methylphenyl and R10 is 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl R1 and R2 are as defined in formula I .Intermediates of the formulae II and III may be prepared as described in the aforementioned U.S.Patents or by analogous methods thereto.Alternatively, intermediates of formulae II and III may be prepared according to one of the following a to Alk is a simple alkyl group such as ethyl .EMI9.1 W.H.

An oral composition may also be in the form of a liquid, such as an aqueous or oily suspension, a solution, emulsion, syrup or elixir, or it may be in the form of a dry product for reconstitution with water or any other pharmaceutically acceptable liquid vehicle. Such liquid compositions generally contain conventional additives where appropriate, such as a suspending agent, emulsifying agent, preservative or flavouring agent.Examples of parenteral compositions include suspensions and solutions which generally contain a surfactant or wetting agent and one or more adjuvants, such as a local anaesthetic, preservative or buffering agent. A parenteral solution may be prepared by dissolving the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an aqueous or non aqueous vehicle and filter sterilizing it prior to filling into a vial or ampoule and sealing. A parenteral suspension may be prepared in much the same manner except that the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is suspended, rather than dissolved, in the vehicle and that sterilization is carried out prior to suspension by exposure of the compound or salt to ethylene oxide. Alternative composition types include suppositories.A unit dose composition, preferably, contains from 0.1 to 1000 mg, such as 0.5 to 500 mg of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Such unit dose compositions may be administered several times a day, such as one, two or three times a day such that the total daily dose is in the range mentioned hereinafter for effective treatment or prophylaxis.The invention also provides a method for the treatment and or prophylaxis of disorders relating to damaged gastro intestinal tissue or to impaired gastro intestinal motility in mammals, such as humans, which comprises the administration to the mammal of an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.The administration to the mammal may be by way of oral administration or parenteral administration.An effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be determined in accordance with the usual factors, such as the nature and severity of the disorder and the weight of the mammal requiring treatment. However, it is believed that an amount from 0.01 to 30 mg kg per day should be sufficient for effective treatment or prophylaxis.No toxicological effects are indicated at the aforementioned dosage range. The invention also provides a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use as an active therapeutic substance and in particular for use in the treatment of disorders relating to damaged gastro intestinal tissue and to impaired gastro intestinal motility.The following Examples illustrate the invention and the following descriptions illustrate the preparation of intermediates.

Cold restraint stress induced gastric erosionsMale Wistar rats, 175 225g bodyweight are used. Forty eight hours prior to testing, animals are placed in mesh bottomed cages with 10 12 animals per cage.Twenty four hours prior to testing, animals are placed in the dark at a temperature of 170C. Sixteen hours prior to testing, food is removed from the cages. Drugs are made up in 0.5 methylcellulose, and adminstered at a volume of 1.0m1 100g bodyweight.Eight rats per group are used, with usually 1 control group and 2 test groups. Animals are placed in Bollman type restraining cages and arranged in a vertical position. Thirty minutes after dosing the animals are placed in an ambient temperature of 40C for 2.5 hours. At the end of this time the rats are sacrificed, the stomachs removed, cut open and pinned out on cork boards. Mucosal damage is assessed visually and scored on a subjective scale. Statistical differences between control and test groups are assessed using a Wilcoxon Ranking Test. The results are shown in Table 1.

Inhibition of ethanol induced gastric mucosal erosive damage in the ratThe object of the experiment was to test the ability of drugs to inhibit a state of gastric submucosal haemorrhage induced by absolute ethanol in the conscious rat. Inhibition of this mucosal damage by drugs may be of use in the development of anti ulcer agents.The procedure used was as follows. Male rats, preferably Wistars, were fasted overnight in wire mesh bottom cages, so as to prevent copraphagy. Water was allowed ad. libitum. Six or seven rats per cage were regarded as suitable, and the weight range of the rats used was between 175 and 300g. Water was removed one hour prior to treatment. The rats were then randomly allocated to their respective treatment groups, so that there were no less than five rats per group. One control group was always included. Each rat was pre dosed with lml lOOg of control or test drug, dissolved or suspended in 0.5 methyl cellulose or 1 Tween 80 in water, via an oral dosing needle.Ninety minutes later each rat was dosed with lml rat p.o. of absolute ethanol. Ten minutes after the absolute ethanol, the rats were killed by an intracardiac injection of Expiral . The stomachs were excised, cut open along the greater curvature to expose the mucosal surface, washed in tap water to remove debris, then stretched on a cork board for examination.A subjective macroscopic examination of the stomach was carried out with a damage score being allocated to each stomach. Two observers were usually used, one of whom scored the results in a blinded manner. The results were then analysed by the Mann Whitney U test, with p 0.O5 being regarded as statistically significant.The results as shown in Table 2. sodium pentobarbitone solution 200mg ml Table 2 EMI84.1 tb SEP Oral SEP Dose SEP SEP Inhibition tb SEP Compound SEP pmol kg SEP mg kg SEP of SEP gastric tb SEP free SEP erosions tb SEP base tb Example SEP 1 SEP 25 SEP 10.47 tb Example SEP 2 SEP 25 SEP 10.75 SEP 47.7 tb Example SEP 5 SEP 25 SEP 10.47 SEP 30 tb Example SEP 7 SEP 25 SEP 10.47 SEP 63.l SEP tb Example SEP 8 SEP 25 SEP 10.47 SEP 46.8 tb Example SEP 9 SEP 25 SEP 10.
