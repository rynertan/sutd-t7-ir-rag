# SHAPED BEAM ANTENNA

## Abstract
A shaped beam antenna comprises an array antenna having a planar surface on which a plurality of radiating elements are arranged, and a main reflector disposed behind with respect to the radiating direction of the array antenna. The main reflector comprises a plurality of partial cylindrical or planar reflector segments. Where Cartesian coordinates is assumed having an origin in the center of the planar surface of the array antenna, an X axis extending in a vertical center axis of the array antenna, a Z axis extending in a direction perpendicular to the planar surface through the origin, and a Y axis, extending in a direction perpendicular to the X and Z axes through the origin, the shaped beam antenna is characterized in that the longitudinal axis of each reflector segments is in parallel with the X axis, the main reflector is symmetrical with respect to the X Z plane and formed convex in a negative direction of the Z axis, and each radiating element is disposed so that its excitation amplitude is symmetrical with respect to the Y Z plane and its excitation phase is antisymmetrical with respect to the Y Z plane, whereby a radiation beam formed by the main reflector is symmetrical with respect to the Z axis on the Y Z plane and is asymmetrical with respect to the Z axis on said X Z plane. Thus, with this antenna, a good beam shaping performance and an excellent cross polarization discrimination can be obtained.
