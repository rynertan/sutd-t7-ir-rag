# Method of producing zirconium having a cross section of low neutron absorption.

## Abstract
The absorption of neutrons of a nuclear reactor without producing fissions is reduced by providing selected isotopes of zirconium for fabrication of parts such as cladding, thimble tubes and grids. Specifically, the zirconium is enriched in ⁹⁰Zr or is depleted in ⁹¹Zr. The selected isotopes are produced by irradiating Zr OC₄H₉ t 4, Zr OC₅H₁₁ t 4 and or Zr OC₃H₇ t 4, with radiation from a CO₂ laser tuned to the vibrations of the CO ⁹⁰Zr , CO ⁹¹Zr , O ⁹¹Zr bond.
