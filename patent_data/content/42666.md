# Time division multiplex telecommunication digital switching module.

## Abstract
The digital switching module DSM is arranged as an LSI device providing digital p.c.m. switching for 256 channels in a space time space format. It is unidirectional in operation and is capable of switching data digitally encoded speech from any incoming channel to any outgoing chan nel. It is arranged to act as a building block in constructing larger digital switching networks. The DSM can be program med to permit combinations of parallel or serial operation at its input and output data interfaces, the mode being selected by the size of the pulse width of the frame start reference signal. The switching configuration of input channels to output channels is held within the DSM and can be amended by messages sent along a serial control interface. Interroga tion of the switching state and of the data passing through the switch is provided by messages applied to an output control interface. The DSM can be arranged into square arrays to provide full availability switching for a greater number of channels. Three programming pins are provided which influence the control logic of the DSM to route the control information incoming to a square array to the appropriate control store. The array may be grown from 8 8 to 16 16 and to 32 32.
