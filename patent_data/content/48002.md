## Description
The present invention relates to a method of preparing N 4 2,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid methotrexate .Methotrexate has been extensively used for over 30 years in cancer chemotherapy as an antineoplastic agent useful in the treatment of acute leukemia and other cancerous diseases. In the past, methotrexate has been accepted in a rather impure state and with unspecified optical rotation cf. U.S.P. XIX 1973 74, p. 315 and B.P. 73, p.300 . The recent development of high dose therapy prompted search for new methods of producing high purity methotrexate.We have now developed an efficient and easy synthesis by whichD , L or D,L methotrexate of very high quality can be produced.The method of the invention comprises alkylating diethyl N 4 methyl amino benzoyl glutamate 11 with 2,4 diamino 6 chloromethylpteridine hydrochloride I in the presence of potassium iodide and hydrolyzing the resulting diethyl N 4 2 ,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methyl amino benzoyl glutamate III to yield N 4 2 ,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid methotrexate of formula VEMI1.1 The hydrolysis is suitably performed by means of sodium hydroxide in aqueous ethanol.In the method of the invention, tedious purification procedures like column chromatography are not necessary simple techniques like precipitation, centrifugation, and washing are sufficient to produce methotrexate of very high purity.One major advantage of the process of the present invention is that no racemisation of the glutamic acid moiety takes place during the reactions. In this manner, the methotrexate obtained as the end product has the same optical configuration at the glutamic acid moiety as the starting material. That is, if the glutamic acid moiety in the compound II is in the L form, L methotrexate is obtained, which constitutes one of the preferred features of the present invention.The starting material I, 2 ,4 diamino 6 chloromethylpteridine hydrochloride, is prepared in a very advantageous way by reacting 2,4diamino 6 hydroxymethylpteridine IV with thionyl chloride at room temperature. When this reaction is performed in the absence of a solvent and in the absence of a catalyst, virtually pure 2,4 diamino6 chloromethylpteridine hydrochloride I is obtained. The hydrochloride is much more soluble than the free base and is, hence, more suitable for the further synthesis.One aspect of the invention is constituted by a method for preparing diethyl N 4 2,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamate III by alkylating diethyl N 4 methylamino benzoyl glutamate II with 2,4 diamino 6 chloromethylp teridine, hydrochloride I in the presence of potassium iodide. Compound III constitutes a valuable known intermediate in the production of methotrexate, and its further conversion into methotrexate by hydrolysis is, in principle, known per se.The reaction between II and 2,4 diamino 6 chloromethylpteridine hydrochloride I is suitably performed in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide or, preferably, dimethylsulphoxide at 10 800 C, preferably at ambient temperature, and the amount of potassium iodide is suitably 1 5 moles, calculated on I. The potassium iodide is preferably used in an amount of 4 moles, calculated on I, and the reaction is preferably performed at room temperature, as these conditions ensure the highest yield and purity of the reaction product.The resulting hydroiodide of the compound III which hydroiodide is novel per se and constitutes an aspect of the present invention may be purified by recrystallization from methanol or neutralized with sodium hydroxide and the free base recrystallized. Both of these working up procedures lead to pure methotrexate after hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide in aqueous ethanol.2,4 Diamino 6 hydroxymethylpteridine IV may be prepared from 5 acetoxymethyl 2 amino 3 cyanopyrazine according to the procedure of E.C. Taylor, J. Org. Chem. 40, 2347 1975 . The complete reaction sequence starting from 5 acetoxymethyl 2 amino 3 cyanopyrazine is shown in the below reaction scheme EMI3.1 The advantages of the principles of the present invention are, inter alia 1 Methotrexate and intermediates are obtained in virtually pure form.2 None or very simple purification procedures are required.3 High yields are obtained in all steps of the synthesis.4 No deterioration of stored intermediates is observed.5 Only common reagents of technical grade need be used throughout the synthesis.6 No racemisation takes place during the synthesis.2,4 Diamino 6 chloromethylpteridine has previously been used in the synthesis of methotrexate cf. British patent No. 1,414,752 EMI4.1 According to the patent, the reaction IV Ia was carried out in an inert medium like chloroform or methylene chloride under reflux in the presence of a basic catalyst, and Ia was obtained as the free base of unspecified purity. It appears from a study of the patent that the condensation of Ia with N 4 methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid gave methotrexate in a very low yield and of poor quality.This is in contrast to the present invention where the hydrochloride of Ia compound I was prepared in high yield and in high purity by a very simple process and was reacted, under special conditions, to form methotrexate of high purity.The utilization of 2,4 diamino 6 halomethylpteridine in the production of methotrexate is also known from other publications and patents J.R. Piper et al., J. Heterocycl. Chem. 11 1974 279, J.R. Piper et al., J. Org. Chem. 42 1977 208, J.R. Piper et al., U.S.4,079,056 and U.S. 4,077,957, J.A. Ellard, U.S. 4,080,325, E. Catalucci, Ger. Offen. 2,741,383 . These authors utilize 2,4 diamino 6bromomethylpteridine hydrobromide Ib as the alkylation agent under carefully selected reaction conditions. Three step synthesis of Ib from 2,4,5,6 tetraaminopyrimidine is described in detail in the above references. The main disadvantage of this procedure is the formation of by product pteridines. Careful monitoring of the reaction conditions is necessary to minimize the amount of contaminates.Example 1. 2, 4 Diamino 6 chloromethylpteridine hydrochloride I . 2 ,4 t iamino 6 hydroxymethylpteridine IV 29.2 g, 0.151 mol was added in one portion to thionyl chloride 290 ml at room temperature.
