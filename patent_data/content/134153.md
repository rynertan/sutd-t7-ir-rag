Test example 1In the compounds synthsized by the method as described above, 9 0 methano A6 9 PGIl, for example, has a biological activity as mentioned below. When the rabbit serum was employed, it depressd a cohesion of platelets to be induced by adenosine diphosphate ADP at a potency of 1 10 to that of PGI2, and it showed a potency of 1 2 to that of PGI2 when the human blood was employed. As for the effects to the blood pressure, when rat was examined, it showed the same effect as that of PGI2 and showed blood pressure depressing action at a dosage of 0.1 Vg kg. An effect to the heart stroke frequencies thereof are almost the same as that of PGI2, and increasing of the heart stroke frequencies were obserbed at a dosage of 1 Vg kg thereof in an experiment by using rats.As for an anti fester action, it showed an activity at a low concentration of 10 6M in an experiment by using rabbit stomach, and it was the same strength as that of PGE2. Cytotoxicity thereof are extremely weak and IC50 5 Vg ml Test example 2 3 4 Carboxybutyl 6 S 3 S hydroxy 3 cyclopentyl 1 trans propenyl 7 R hydroxy 1S,5S cisbicyclo 3.3.0 oct 2 ene has biological activities as shown below. By using rabbit stomach epithelial cells, an experiment according to the method of Murota et. al. K. Matsuoka, Y. Mitsui, and S. Murota, J. Pharm. Dyn., 5, 991 1982 1 was carried out to obtain the result that it showed a remarkable anti fester action at a low concentration of 0.5 x 10 6 M. This effect is the same as that of PGE2 which is representative prostaglandin having anti fester action. The above carbacyclin derivatives has no diarrhea inductive effect whereas thePGE2 inducesheavy diarrhea.
