# Method and apparatus for creating fonts for an electronic character generator.

## Abstract
A system for creating font memory banks to be used as look up tables in a character generator of a dot matrix printer. This system involves the combination of memory and operator input whereby memory banks of individualized fonts may be designed. The print characteristics of the type of printer to be used are simulated to facilitate the font creating process.
