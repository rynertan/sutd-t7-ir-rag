## Description
Thiazolidin.edione Derivatives, Their Production and Use This invention relates to novel thiazolidinedione derivatives, a method of preparing them and antidiabetic agents containing same, which is utilized in the field of medicines. A variety of biguanide and sulfonylurea derivatives have been used clinically as antidiabetic agents. However, the biguanides are now scarecely used, because they t.end.to cause lactic acidosis, and use of the sulfonylureas, though they have strong hypoglycemic activities, requires sufficient precaution, because they cause serious hypoglycemia frequently. Therefore, a new type of antidiabetic agent free from these defects has been desired. On the other hand, in Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication Nos 22636 1980 and 64586 1980, Chemical BR Pharmaceutical Bul.letin, 30, p. 3563 1982 , ibid, 30, p. 3580 1982 , and ibid, 32, p. 2267 1984 , reference is made to Åa variety of thiazolidinediones having blood glucose and lipid lowering actions. Antidiabetic activity of ciglitazone was also reported in Diabetes, 32, p. 804 1983 . Those compounds, however, have not yet been put to practical use. As the reasons, 1 insufficient activities or and 2 serious toxicities may be mentioned. The present inventors synthesized various compounds which are not concretely described in the above mentioned publications of unexamined patent applications and have made studies on them to find compounds exhibiting potent pharmacological effects with lower toxicity. The present invention is to provide compounds which can be used practically as antidiabetic agents having a broad safety margin between pharmacological effect and toxicity or unfavorable side reactions. The present invention relates to 1. A compound of the formula EMI2.1 or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, 2. an antidiabetic agent, which contains as the effective component a compound of the formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, and 3. a method of preparing a compound of the formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises hydrolyzing a compound of the formula EMI2.2 The compounds representable by the above formula I include, specifically stating, the following ones. 5 4 2 3 ethyl 2 pyridyl ethoxylbenzyll 2,4 thiazolidinedione, 5 4 2 4 ethyl 2 pyridyl ethoxy benzyl 2,4 thiazolidinedione, 5 4 2 4 ethyl 2 pyridyl ethoxy benzyl 2,4 thiazolidinedione, 5 4 2 6 ethyl 2 pyridyl ethoxy benzyll 2,4 thiazolidinedione. The compound I of this invention contains both basic nitrogen and acid nitrogen in its molecule, and it can be led.to a pharmacologically acceptable salt, when desired, by using a suitable acid or base. Such acid.salts are exemplified by mineral salts e.g. hydroch.loride, hydrobromide, sulfate, etc. , organic acid salts e.g. succinate, maleate, fumarate, malate, tartrate, etc. and sulfonates e.g. methanol sulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, etc. .Such basic salts are. exemplified by alkali metal salts e.g. sodium salt, potassium salt, alkaline earth metal salts,e.g. calcium salt, etc. All of these salts can be prepared by per se known means. The compound I of this invention or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof exhibits bloodglucose and blood lipid lowering action with lower toxicity, which can be used as it is or in admixture with á per se known pharmacologically acceptable carrier, excipient or filler as an antidiabetic agent for mammals including man. The antidiabetic agent is usually administered orally as tablets, capsules including soft capsules and microcapsules , powders, granules, etc. and depending on the caset , parenterally as injections, suppositories, pellets, etc. Oral administration to an adult patient is desirably 0.05 10 mg kg body weight day, and parenterally 0.01 10 mg kg body weight day, once daily or divided into 2 4 times a week. The compound represented by the above mentioned general formula I and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as Compound I can be prepared by subjecting a compound represented by the general formula 11 to hydrolysis.This reaction proceeds advantageously in a proper solvent by employing a mineral acid. The solvent is exemplified by alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, 2 methoxyethanol, etc. , dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, etc., and the mineral acid is exemplified by hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, etc. The reaction temperature ranges from 200C to 1500C The reaction time is 0.5 20 hours. The compound I or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof produced as mentioned above can be isolated and purified by conventional means such as concentration extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound represented by the above mentioned general formula II can be produced by the following reactions EMI4.1 EMI5.1 wherein R stands for hydrogen or lower alkyl . The lower alkyl group represented by R is exemplified by C14 ones such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and butyl. The reaction.for producing compound V from compound III and compound IV is conducted in the presence of, for example, sodium hydride. This reaction can be carried out in a solvent e.g. dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from lO0C to 300C. The reaction from compound V to compound VI can easily be conducted by conventional catalytic reduction employing,for example, palladium carbon as the catalyst. Compound VI may be isolated as the pure product or can be subjected to the subsequent reaction step without isolation and purification.Compound VIII can be produced by subjecting compound VI to diazotization in the presence of an aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid, then allowing the resultant to react with acrylic acid or its lower alkyl ester VII in the presence of a copper catalyst e.g. cuprous oxide, cupric oxide, cuprous chloride, cupric chloride, cuprous bromide, cupric bromide, etc. Meerwein arylation . Compound VIII canbepurified by e.g. chromatography, and subjected to the subsequent reaction without isolation or purification. Compound VIII is then allowed to react with thiourea to give compound II . This reaction is carried out usually in alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, 2 methoxyethanol, etc. , dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, etc. The reaction temperature is usually 20 1800C,preferably 60 1500C. The amount of thiourea to be employed is 1 2 moles relative to one mole of compound VIII . In this reaction, as the reaction proceeds, hydrogen bromide is produced as a by product, and, for capturing. this by product, the reaction may be conducted in the presence of sodium acetate potassium acetate, etc., in an amount of usually 1 1.5 mole relative to 1 mole of compound VIII . The resultant compound II can be isolated, but may be led to the hydrolysis step directly without isolation The compound I of the present invention has an excellent blood glucose and lipid lowering activity and is remarkably low in toxicity, which is supported by the following experimental data.Experimental Examples 1.
