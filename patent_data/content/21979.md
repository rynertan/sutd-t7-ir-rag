# Polyarylate blends with copolyesters.

## Abstract
The invention deals with polyarylate blends with copolyesters. The blends according to the invention comprise polyarylates derived from a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a copolyester derived from a cyclohexane dimethanol, an alkylene glycol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid. These blends have improved processability, weatherability and impact properties.
