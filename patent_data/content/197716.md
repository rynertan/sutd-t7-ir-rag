# PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF SOLIDS FROM AN OIL AND MIXTURE USEFUL THEREFOR

## Abstract
A process for removing suspended solids, particularly difficultly filterable inorganic solids, from hydrocarbon oils such as those obtained as a refinery process bottom fraction from both steam and catalytic cracking units or from coal conversion processes e.g., coal tar by adding to the oil an agglomerating agent comprising a mixture of a water soluble polyelectrolyte and a water soluble demulsifier such as an oxyalkylated phenol formaldehyde resin glycol ester whereby said solids are clustered together into readily filterable agglomerates.
