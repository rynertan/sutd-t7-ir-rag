## Abstract
A method and a device for feeding electric and or electronic elements 200 to positions in which the elements can be picked up by transfer members 205 . The device comprises feed channels 202 in which the elements can be arranged between guides in parallel rows with equal dis tances between the elements in each row. Means are provided for simultaneously advancing all the rows of elements in a step wise manner through a distance at each step which is equal to the distance between the centres of the elements in each row, the ends of the feed channels comprising openings 203 which are accessible to transfer members 205 .
