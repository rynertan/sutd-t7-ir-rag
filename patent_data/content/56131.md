# Needle selection device in a circular knitting machine, in particular a hose knitting machine.

## Abstract
For needle selection in a circular knitting machine, a device is disclosed which comprises a plurality of superimposed selecting levers 4 , individually pivoted to a common structure 3 and selectively movable between a position where they do not interfere with the pattern jack butts 8 and a position where they interfere therewith, to urge them toward the needle cylinder 2 . The selective movement is accomplished by means of electromagnets 16 , one for each selecting lever 4 , which are energized in accordance with the machine knitting program and move intermediate, preferably rod like, drive elements 17 the axial displacement whereof results in a pivotal movement of the respective selecting levers 4 between the cited positions. The engagement of the intermediate elements 17 with the selecting levers 4 is accomplished through geometrical soupling. A minimal force is sufficient for the actuation, so that the size of the electromagnets 16 can be minimized, while a prompt response is ensured.
