# Method of displaying image.

## Abstract
A method of displaying graphic image surface informa tion data of an object 4 lying within a three dimensional space on a two dimensional display screen 5 when seen from a predetermined observing point 3 is disclosed. A patch of the surface 4A of an object 4 is separated into plural triangular units UA1, UA2 , and image information data luminance, visible nonvisible, and distance are all represented at the three apexes PX of each triangular unit area UA1, UA2 which includes a number of display pixels. The positional data at the three apexes PX are transformed from three to two dimensional space. The other image information data are calculated in accordance with interpola tion calculation. Prior to the interpolation calculation a display area is determined and a triangular area including pixels to be processed is determined to reduce the proces sing time. This process is repeated for the entire surface 4A to be displayed.
