# Displacement measuring transducers and their use for sensing vehicle suspension displacements.

## Abstract
An induction displacement transducer is described in which the magnitude of the phase difference bet ween A.C. current and voltage in a coil 1 is dependent upon the axial displacement of a monitored object 7. The phase difference depends upon the axial position relative to the coil of a short circuit turn 9 which moves with the monitored object. A magnetic flux concentrator 5, which may be com bined with the short circuit turn, enhances the flux linking between the short circuit turn and the coil. In order to sense the height of a vehicle suspension strut, the coil 1 is mounted on a plastics dirt shield 13, the short circuit turn is provided by a sleeve 10 plated with an electrically conductive metal and secured to the strut cylinder 6 . Various circuits are described for monitoring the height signals produced by the different suspension struts of a vehicle.
