# Optical fibre splicing.

## Abstract
In apparatus comprising optical fibre aligning equip ment and optical fibre fusion splicing equipment 1 , the means for effecting operation of the optical fibre aligning equipment and the means for effecting operation of the optical fibre fusion splicing equipment are mounted in a hand held control unit 3 connected to the equipment by a flexible electric ribbon cable 2 . Since the operating means of the apparatus is remote from the vicinity of the fusion splice, any risk that handling or touching of the apparatus by an operator and or movement of an operator in the vicinity of the fusion splice may result in sufficient vibration to cause dis alignment of the optical fibres is substantially eliminated.

## Description
EMI1.1 OPTICAL FIBRE SPLICING This invention relates to end to end fusion splicing of optical fibres and especially, but not exclusively, to end to end fusion splicing of single mode optical fibres. Many techniques differing from one another have been proposed for effecting an end to end fusion splice between optical fibres and, in all of these fusion splicing techniques, apparatus is employed which includes equipment for aligning the optical fibres to be spliced and equipment for effecting the fusion spliceFor a satisfactory fusion splice to be obtained, it is imperative that throughout the splicing operation the optical fibres are held with their axes co linear. We have found, especially where the optical fibres to be spliced are single mode optical fibres, that any slight vibration to which the aligned optical fibres may be subjected prior to and or during effecting the fusion splice may result in slight movement of one or both optical fibres so that their axes are no longer co linear. It is an object of the present invention to provide, for effecting an end to end fusion splice between optical fibres, improved apparatus which substantialy reduces the risk that dis alignment of the optical fibres may occur during the fusion splicing operation as a result of vibration and which is especially suitable for use in the field. According to the invention, in the improved apparatus comprising optical fibre aligning equipment and optical fibre fusion splicing equipment, at least the means for effecting operation of the optical fibre fusion splicing equipment is of such a form that it can be actuated at a position remote from the vicinity of the fusion splice. Preferably, the means for effecting operation of the optical fibre aligning equipment and the means for effecting operation of the optical fibre fusion splicng equipment are of such a form that they can be activated at a position remote from the vicinity of the fusion splice. The operating means of the optical fibre fusion splicing equipment, or the operating means of the optical fibre aligning and fusion splicing equipment, preferably is or are mounted in a hand held control unit and is or are connected to the equipment by at least one length of electric cable or is or are of such a form that the equipment can be activated by infra red raditaion or other remotely controlled means. Since the operating means of the apparatus can be remote from the vicinity of the fusion splice, any risk that handling or touching of the apparatus by an operator and or movement of an operator in the vicinity of the fusion splice may result in sufficient vibration to cause dis alignment of the optical fibres is substantially eliminated. The invention is further illustrated by a description, by way of example, of a preferred hand held control unit for use in improved apparatus for effecting an end to end fusion splice between optical fibres with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the improved apparatus, and Figure 2 is a perspective view of the preferred hand held control unit. Referring to the drawing, the improved apparatus comprises optical fibre aligning equipment and optical fibre fusion splicing equipment indicated by the block 1 and, connected to the equipment by a flexible electric ribbon cable 2, a hand held control unit 3. The control unit 3 comprises a housing 4 of electrically insulating material in which is mounted a switch 5 for selecting any one of ten programmes for automatically aligning and subsequently fusion splicing two optical fibres, each of the programmes being specific to optical fibres of a particular size and of a particular material and type. A monitor 6 provides a digital indication when the alignment of the two optical fibres is at an optimum and light emissive devices 7 provide visual indications of the various stages reached in the optical fibre aligning and fusion splicing processes. When a programme appropriate to the optical fibres to be spliced has been selected by use of the switch 5, the hand held control unit is activated by a control switch 8.
