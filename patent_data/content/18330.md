## Description
h winn hinging crevice, designed especially for metal lockers containin electrical and electronic equipment This invention refers to a wing hinging device, designed especially for metal lockers containing electric ann electronic equipment. hs far as electric and electronic equipment lockers are concerned, the current tendency is to provide their wings with outside rabbet edges, so that the matching line between said wings and the body of the lockers is arranged laterally, in line with the side walls of the lockers. 8 number of defects, however, are to be noted in currently adopted hinging systems, one of them being the fact that it is necessary to arrange for some open areas in the wings, near the hinges, in order to allow the opening and closing of the wings themselves, thus leading to possible infiltrations whenever the locker is exposed to the atmo spheric agents.In some other cases, once again in order to allow the wings to open and close, one proceeded to eliminate the top and bottom bent edges of said wings, but again the results were rather unsatisfactory from the aesthetic and operational point of view.The main purpose of this invention is to eliminate the aforementioned defects exhibited by currently adopted systems, supplying a wing hing ing device capable of ensuring the perfect movement of same, without however rcquirinr the rer oval of components near the hinges or the e elimination of the top and bettor bent edges of the wings, thus produc ins continuous structures both the frontally ant laterally, with consid erable functional advantages. pother important object of this invention is to realize a hinging device which may allow the manufacture of staunch lockers for electrical and electronic equipment all along the contour of their wings, accord ing to a particularly rational arrangement.A further important object of this invention is to work out a hinting device of the aforementioned type, which may be easy to realize and quick to install.The above as well as other objects still, which may possibly arise in the course of the following description, are attained by the wing hinging device, designed especially for metal lockers containing electrical and electronic equipment, in accordance with this invention, said lockers being equipped with at least one wing having an edge with a 900 bend in respect of its lie, so that the matching line between the above wing and the body of the locker is arranged laterally, in line with the side walls of the locker, said device being characterized by the fact that the aforementioned edge is to be continuous along all sides of said wing and that two hinges are arranged relative to one side of the latter, each hinge comprising a first bush which is fixed, e.g. welded, inside said edge of the wing and a second bush which is integral by means of a distance piece with a plate that can be secured, by means of litte bolts or similar accessories, to a recessed edge defining the opening of the body of the locker, said recessed edge being basically parallel to the sides of the locker.Such arrangement allows one to open the wing up to 90 , without having to provide flutes or similar accessories opposite the edge of same thus, when the locker is closed, the aforementioned hinges cannot be seen from any angle whatever, while, when the locker is open, there is no annoying protrusion of the hinges, as occurs with some known types of locker.Further features and advantages of the invention will uproar in the course of the following detailed description of a hinting Cevice, LL cording to the present invention, designed for a metal locker win containinn electrical and electronic equipement, which is supplied by way of example with reference to the enclosed drawiny, in which Figure 1 is a horizontal section of a locker designed for electrical and electronic equipment, endowed with the device drawn in accordance with the invention figure 2 is a vertical cross section, executed along path 11 11 of figure 1 Figure 3 shows detail lil of figure 1 on an enlarged scale Figure 4 is e section executed alone path IV IV of figure 3 Figure 5 gives a perspective view of a hinge of the device in accor dance with the invention. Heferring to said figures, 1 has been adopted in order to indicate the body of a locker for electrical and electronic equipment, paralle lepipedon in shape, and 2 in order to indicate its corresponding wing, which is endowed on all of its sides with an edge 3 with a 900 bend in respect of the wings lie, so that the matching line between wing 2 and body 1 is arranged laterally, in line with the side walls of the locker.Figure 2 shows also the base of the locker, 4 .The opening of body 1 is defined by a recessed edge 5, which is parallel to the body sides of the locker, and is present along all the sides of the abovementioned opening. 1ore precisely, such recessed edge is connected to the sides of body 1 by means of a spacer Se fis. 3 set at 900 relative to said edge 5, while a fold Sb, with a 900 angle too, is arranged outwardly, and defines a rabbet facing the inside surface of wing 2.Two hinges are provided on the hinging sice, each of which comprises two bushes 5, 7 and a pin 8, E.y means of a distance piece a, bush is integral with a plate 5b, which is equipped with two holes c fi i. O for the passage of respective locking bolts 9. dilate Fib is secured, by means of the aforementioned little bolts Lj, to the recessed edge 5 of body 1, as shown clearly in figures 3 and 4, so that bush ri may be facing outwardly. The corresponding bush 7, on the other hand, is fixed to the inside surface of edge 3 of wing 2, by means of a welding 10 produced near the hinging axis.After the above explanation, the assembly and employment of the device according to the invention appear to be obvious.Two bushes 7 are secured to wing 1 by welding them, as mentioned hereabove, onto the inside surface of edge 3, where the hinging is to be effected, according to a mutual alignment. baid edge 3 is therefore unimpaired on all the four sides of wing 2.Two bushes u will be secured correspondingly, in the abovementioned fashion, by means of the respective plates 5b to the recessed edge 5 of the opening of body 1, by mutual alignment.The design requires that, after assembly, bush 7 in the upper hinge be above bush, while in the lower hinge bush 7 must be placed below bush as as shown clearly in figure 4. The connection between the abovementioned bushes is to be executed by means of pins 8, in accordance with a known method. In the closed position, wing 2 is resting on rabbet edge Sb in order to achieve a good seal, a gasket dotted as 11 in fig. 3 may be interposed between said edge and wing 2 such gasket may be secured e.g. to the inside surface of wing 2 or to edge 5b. Such gasket is supplied on the whole contour of the opening of body 1. ith such an arrangement, wing 2 can open normally, as shown by the dotted lines in figures 1 and 3, until it reaches 900 in respect of the matching line. The hinges are always outside the adit of the lock er, thus eliminating any protrusion which might hinder the use of the locker, the only internal protrusions being the extremely small nuts and bolts 9 and the ends of the latter. s may be noted, the device according to this invention ensures a highly rational structuring of all lockers generally speaking, and of metal lockers designed for alec trical and electronic equipment in particular, thanks to the fact that it provides hinges without protrusions and makes for the continuity of the side walls, a feature which is of great advantage frorn the aesthetic point of view and in view of the realization of perfectly staunch conditions.
