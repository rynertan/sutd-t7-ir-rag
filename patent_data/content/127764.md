## Description
SENSITIZATION OF GLYOXYLATE PHOTOINITIATORSBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the sensitization of glyoxylate photoinitiators. Description of the Prior Art Glyoxylate photoinitiators are known compounds and possess the glyoxylate group C O C O O attached to suitable moieties which confer photoinitiator utility on the resulting compound. Compounds of this type are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,038,164 to F. A. Via, which is incorporated herein by reference. That patent describes compounds of the formulaEMI1.1 where R can be a straight or branched hydrocarbon e.g.,C1 C10alkyl of from one to ten carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl, or mono di, or trisilyl and R is an aromatic heterocycle, aryl of from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or mono , di or polysubstituted phenyl with such substituents as alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio and halogen. Preferably R is alkyl and R is phenyl.A commercial product of this type is sold under the trademark VICURE 55 by Stauffer Chemical Company and contains methyl phenyl glyoxylate as the photoinitiator. Summary of the Present Invention It has now been found that benzophenone compounds can function as effective sensitizers for the abovedescribed glyoxylate photoinitiators.Detailed Description of the Present Invention The compositions curable by actinic radiation according to the invention can contain a polymerizable polymer in a reactive ethylenically unsaturated monomeric medium, a reactive polymer alone, a reactive monomer alone, or any of these combined with an inert solvent. Additionally, the polymerizable composition can contain any of the pigments commonly used in photopolymerization techniques. The process can be carried out by mixing a quantity of photoinitiating compound of the present invention with a photopolymerizable composition and exposing the resultant mixture to actinic radiation. Alternatively, a one component system comprising the photopolymerizable composition, the photoinitiator of the invention, and if desired, pigmentation, can be formed. The photoinitiating compounds of the invention are suitable in the actinic light curing of unsaturated monomeric compounds either alone or as copolymerizable constituents of unsaturated polymer monomer systems.Such systems are composed of mixtures of conventional unsaturated polymers and unsaturated monomers. Monomers which are useful in practicing the invention are acrylic, alkacrylic and chioroacrylic acid compounds such as esters, amides and nitriles. Examples of such compounds are acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methacrylamide and methyl chloroacrylate. Also useful, although not preferred due to their slower rates of reactivity, are vinyl and vinylidene esters, ethers and ketones. Additionally, compounds having more than one terminal unsaturation can be used.Examples of these include diallyl phthalate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl phosphate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, glycerol trimethylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, methacrylic anhydride, and allyl ethers of monohydroxy or polyhydroxy compounds, such as ethylene glycol diallyl ether, pentaerythritol, tetraallyl ether, and the like. Nonterminally unsaturated compounds such as diethyl fumarate can similarly be used. The acrylic acid derivatives are particularly well suited to the practice of the invention and are consequently preferred components as monomers in monomercontaining polymerizable systems and as reactive centers in polymerizable polymers. While monomeric styrene can be used in the practice of the invention, it is not a preferred constituent of systems polymerizable thereby due to its slow rate of reaction. A preferred manner of practicing the invention is by the use of photopolymerizable molding and coating compositions which comprise mixtures of unsaturated polymeric compounds and monomeric compounds copolymerizable therewith. The polymeric compounds can be conventional polyesters prepared from unsaturated polycarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaconic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid and the like, and polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,4 butanediol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane and the like. The carboxylic acid content can also contain saturated components. The inclusion of a monobasic fatty acid content, either as such or in the form of a triglyceride or oil, in the photopolymerizable polyester composition to comprise an alkyd resin is also acceptable.These resins can, in turn, be modified by silicones, epoxides, isocyanates, etc., by known techniques. In accordance with the present invention the glyoxylate containing photopolymerizable composition contains an effective amount e.g., from about 0.1 to about 10 , by weight of the photopolymerizable composition of a benzophenone compound to sensitize the photoinitiator to photopolymerization. Preferably, the benzophenone compounds are of the formulaEMI4.1 where R and R can independently be hydrogen, alkoxy, halogen, amino, or alkyl substituted amino. Preferably the alkyl moiety, if present, is lower alkyl e.g., C1 C8 alkyl . Thus it is seen that the constitution of photopolymerizable compositions which can be used in the practice of the invention is widely variable. However, the compounds enumerated above are purely illustrative. Materials subject to polymerization by actinic radiation as well as permissible variations and substitutions of equivalent components within particular types of compositions are well know to those skilled in the art. The glyoxylate photoinitiators can be utilized in amounts ranging from 0.01 to about 30 by weight based on the photopolymerizable composition. However, preferable amounts of the compounds are from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent with optimal results being achieved with amounts in the range of from about 1.0 to about 16 weight percent. An acceptable source of actinic light radiation is any apparatus which emits light radiation in the approximate region of from about 2000 Angstroms to about 8000Angstroms and preferably from about 2400 Angstroms to about 5400 Angstroms. One such apparatus is PPG ModelQC 1202, a W processor, manufactured by PPG Industries,Inc. The present invention is illustrated by the Examples which follow. TEST PROCEDURE USED IN THE EXAMPLES The induced rate of photopolymerization of a standard test solution of acrylate alkyd resin was measured for each of the compounds tested. This standard test solution consisted of 42 , by weight, trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA , 17 by weight, of ethylhexyl acrylate EHA , and 41 , by weight of an unsaturated long chain linseed oil alkyd resin ACTQMER X 80 Resin fromUnion Carbide . The test solution was exposed to light radiation from a light source PPG Model QC 1202 which contained two high intensity, medium pressure quartz mercury lamps, 12 inches in length, with each operating at a linear power density of about 200 watts per inch or 2400 watts per lamp. The lamps were housed in an elliptical reflector above a variable speed conveyor belt so that each lamp provided a 2 inch band of high flux actinic radiation on the conveyor. This 2 inch exposure area was bordered on both sides by an additional 2 inch area of medium flux energy for a total radiation area of 6 inches for each lamp. In the curing data presented herein, the cure rate of the polymerizable compositions is presented in feet per minute per lamp ft. min lamp . Thus, a conveyor belt speed of one foot min. will, with a 12 inch exposure area for the two lamps, provide 60 seconds of exposure or a cure rate of 0.5 ft. min. lamp. Similarly, a belt speed of 10 ft. min.will provide 6 seconds of exposure or a rate of 5.0 ft. min. lamp, while a speed of 20.0 ft. min. will give 3 seconds exposure or a rate of 10 ft. min. lamp. The extent of curing was determined by a standard pencil hardness test with all samples being coated on aluminum plate to a thickness of 2 mils and polymerized to achieve standard pencil hardness of from 4H to 6H where this was attainable. EXAMPLES 1 5 In the following Examples the standard test solution was used with methyl phenyl glyoxylate being used as the photoinitiator at 4 wt. percent in each case. The benzophenone compound was used at 1 wt. percent in all cases and the substituents R and R in accordance with the formula for such compound given earlier being in the meta position on both rings Sensitizer Cure Rate R and R ft. min. lamp None Used Control 14 H 25 OCH3 20 C1 18 N CH2CH3 2 20 yellowing was noticed upon curing The foregoing Examples should not be construed in a limiting sense since they merely illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention. The scope of protection sought is set forth in the claims which follow.
