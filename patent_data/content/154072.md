# Production of high purity white phosphorus.

## Abstract
A process for the production of high purity phosphorus characterised in that it comprises A heating high purity red phosphorus in vacuo to cause it to vaporize and B condensing liquid white phosphorus in vacuo is disclosed. Referring to the accompanying illustrative diagram, red phosphorus may be heated in bulb A and condensed in collective bulb G. The present invention provides advances over the prior art. For example, the clear, colourless phosphorus produced may be utilized as a source of P4 species for chemical vapour deposition, sputtering, vacuum deposition and molecular beam deposition of phosphorus, polyphosphide and other phosphorus compound films for semiconductor and other applications including insulation and passivation.
