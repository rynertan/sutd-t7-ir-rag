A process for the preparation of a catalyst which contains a metal of Group VIII and a metal of Group VI B as well as a carrier material, by impregnating shaped particles containing transition alumina with an ammoniacal solution which contains these metals, thereafter evaporating to dryness, calcining and sulphiding, characterized in that shaped particles are impregnated with an ammoniacal metal solution which has an initial pH between 10.5 and 13, preferably between 11.0 and 12.5.

## Description
The application relates to a catalyst for hydrotreatment of mineral oil and fractions thereof so that the oil is dehydro sulphurized HDS , dehydro nitrogenized HDN and or hydrogenated HYD , i.e. that organic sulphur compounds are converted into hydrogen sulphide, organic nitrogen compounds are converted into ammonia and unsaturated compounds are converted into saturated compounds. Such catalysts are also useful for removing oxygen and or metals HDO and HDM, respectively and for hydrocracking. Also, such catalysts are used in the processing of synthetic, crude oil syncrudes and liquefied coal. Depending on the desired improvement in the mineral oil fraction one or more of the hydrotreatment reactions as mentioned above is desirable e.g. only HDS or HDS and HDN . This desired selectivity in the hydrotreatment process can be obtained to some extent by choosing the appropriate process conditions and by choosing a suitable catalyst. These catalytic conversions are large scale industrial operations in the upgrading and refining of mineral oil fractions and, consequently, there is a need of suitable catalysts of varying selectivities and high activity. Generally, for this purpose combinations of metal sulphides of Group VI B and Group VIII are used on a carrier. As a rule, these catalysts are sulphidated Under a transition alumina is to be understood the intermediate forms which are obtained by thermal decomposition of aluminium hydroxide. These transition aluminas contain less than 0.5 mole of water per mole of Al₂O₃, depending on the temperature up to which they have been treated. Well known transition aluminas are gamma, eta and chi partly crystallized , as well as kappa, theta and delta, the last three being better crystallized than the first three. Preferred are aluminas having a pore volume of 0.4 1.0 ml g. Sometimes for special applications it is advantageous to incorporate also some up to 25 , preferably less than 10 amorphous and or crystalline aluminium silicate in the carrier material. As a rule, the carrier material is applied as pre formed particles, i.e. as extrudate, globules, rods and such like. More particularly, often combinations of cobalt or nickel, on one hand, and molybdenum or tungsten, on the other hand, are used on shaped carrier material predominantly consisting of transition alumina. Catalysts of this type and their preparation are known from prior art. Thus US A 4399058 Gulf Research mentions catalysts, in which alumina is impregnated with an ammoniacal solution of nickel sulphate and a molybdenum salt. According to column 9, lines 14 32, impregnation is carried out with an ammoniacal solution having pH 8.4 in the absence of the molybdate the pH would have been about 10. . Also GB A 1368795 Pechiney Saint Gobain discloses similar catalysts based on an aluminous support which are impregnated with ammoniacal nickel nitrate solutions. Likewise, GB A 1408760 Shell Int. Research Min. discloses such catalysts, prepared from a range of support materials, with e.g. diluted ammoniacal solutions of molybate and nickel cobalt chloride, carbonate or acetate. Nitrates are disclosed in ammoniacal 2 3 solutions which show a pH between 6 and 7.5. There is also NL A 8303538 Nippon Oil , in which it is disclosed that an ammoniacal solution of a metal carbonate, together with an organic acid, such as tartaric acid or malic acid at a pH between 8.5 and 10.0. Finally there is US A 3810830 J. van Klinken et al, assigned to Shell Int. Res. Mij disclosing catalysts based on a silica alumina hydrogel which is impregnated with metal combinations such as nickel and molybdenum, preferably as carboxylates and amine complexes. It has now appeared that the cobalt molybdenum catalyst is active for HDS but barely active for HDN, while the cheaper nickel molybdenum catalyst is active for HDN but less active for HDS when compared with the cobalt molybdenum catalyst. The nickel tungsten catalyst is especially active for the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and further moderately active for HDS and HDN. The nickel molybdenum catalyst is also used for this application. Consequently, there is need for a catalyst, preferably on the basis of the cheaper nickel, which combines a high HDS with a high HDN and high activity for the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds. In particular there is in this connection need for catalysts with a low metal content, or possibly normal metal content, having improved catalytic properties. It has now been found that catalysts having an excellent selectivity and activity can be prepared by impregnating shaped alumina particles with an ammoniacal metallic solution having a particularly high pH value, namely between 10.5 and 13, preferably between 11.0 and 12.5, and subsequently evaporating the impregnated alumina particles to dryness, calcining and sulphiding. The impression exists that the better properties are connected with a very fine dispersion of the active phase and a decreased formation of a metal of Group VIII,in particular nickel, aluminate, which metal aluminates are catalytically inactive. Moreover, at the higher pH value polymeric molybdate could form to a lesser degree, thus resulting in a lower tendency for nickel to segregate from the molybdenum. During the evaporation of the impregnated carrier material to dryness, ammonia gas escapes, as a result of which the pH drops. On theoretical grounds, however, it is to be expected that, with the process according to the present invention, this seldom drops to values below 8.5 9.0. If, in the ammoniacal metal solution, considerable amounts of anions of stronger acids occur, particularly of strong mineral acids, such as sulphuric acid and nitric acid, it can then be expected that these will bring about an important reduction of the pH, not only during the evaporation but already in the starting pH. It is therefore recommendable that the impregnation liquid in the present case the ammoniacal metal solution be completely or substantially free of anions which are derived from acids stronger than carbonic acid and particularly be free, or substantially free, of anions of strong mineral acids and free of amions strongly binding to transition metals such as anions of organic acids. Therefore an ammoniacal metal solution can be prepared by dissolving finely divided metal of Group VIII in a solution of ammonium carbonate in ammonia and passing through oxygen. The solution of ammonium carbonate in ammonia is prepared conveniently by passing carbon dioxide through a solution of ammonia. The ammoniacal metal solution then contains substantially carbonate and or hydroxyl ions as anions. This includes hydroxy carbonate ions. Alternatively, the ammoniacal metal solution can also be prepared by dissolving group VIII metal, more in particular nickel cobalt carbonate in concentrated ammonia whilst refluxing and subsequent addition of ammonium carbonate and or carbamate. The ammonium molybdate tungstate or another group VI compound is then added, and a solution with a pH between 10.5 and 13.0 results. The present invention provides a novel, highly active catalyst with a well dispersed active phase. These catalysts are very active for hydrodesulphurization and hydrodenitrogenation, even when the catalysts contain low percentages of metal s . The catalysts contain 0.5 20, preferably 1 10 by weight, calculated on the catalyst, of the metal of Group VIII, and 2.5 60, preferably 10 25 by weight of the metal of Group VI, while their ratio lies between 40 1 and 1 5, preferably between 1 1 and 1 3 Group VIII to Group VI . The high activity is related to the well dispersed active phase which is reflected by oxygen chemisorption values of above 185 micromoles oxygen per gram catalyst measured in the sulphided state according to Applied Catalysis 17 1985 , 273 308, Elsevier Science Publ. . Preferably the oxygen chemisorption values range between 200 and 300 and values between 240 and 270 are typical. The reference catalyst is promoted with P₂O₅ to boost HDN activity, whereas catalysts of Examples 3 and 8 do not contain P₂O₅. Tested here with a light cycle oil LCO which was different from that used in the test of the activities of catalysts below. The high degree of dispersion is also reflected by the BET surface area data of the catalysts in the oxidic state. From surface areas determined for the carrier and the finished catalyst the surface area retention factor RF was calculated according to The surface area retention factors RF of the catalysts according to the present invention are between 105 and 120 unless the catalyst is P₂O₅ promoted which indicates that the precursor of the active phase is well dispersed. It is assumed that anions of mineral acids or anions strongly binding to transition metal such as organic acids when present in the catalyst precursor affect the dispersion of the active phase. It will be clear that in this way a catalyst according to the invention will be obtained which is substantially free of anions which are derived from stronger acids, in particular free of mineral acids. After the carrier has been impregnated at least once with the above mentioned ammoniacal solution, it is dried and calcined. The drying generally takes place at temperatures between 50 and 150 C, whereafter calcining is carried out at a temperature which usually lies between 150 and 650 C. The catalyst, in the form thus obtained of the phase consisting of oxides, is ready to be marketed. It is self evident that the original form and the properties of the carrier material remain for the greater part the same, but processing can, for example, influence the porosity. During the impregnation with solutions of salts of metals of Group VI and Group VIII in ammonia, but also thereafter or beforehand, one or more promoters can be incorporated in the catalyst. Suitable promoters 1 10 w.w. are for example calcium oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide and P₂O₅. Before the catalyst is used, it should first be sulphided. This sulphiding can take place by bringing the catalyst into contact with a sulphur containing compound, for example hydrogen mixed with hydrogen sulphide, carbon disulphide or a mercaptan. This can be carried out conveniently The hydrotreatment according to the invention takes place with a catalyst such as described above, depending on the mineral oil fraction and the catalyst, as well as on the desired conversions HDS, HDN, HDO, HYD, HDM carried out under very diverse conditions. The total pressure mainly the hydrogen pressure can vary between 10.10⁵Pa and 300.10⁵Pa hydrogen oil fraction ratio between 1 2500 m³ m³ the reaction temperature varies between 100 and 500 C. The properties of the catalyst are determined in the present application according to standard test procedures which are described below. The hydrogenating activity of catalysts is determined on the basis of the catalysed hydrogenation of cyclohexene. The test is carried out in a heated tubular reactor having an internal diameter of 12 mm, provided with a thermocouple well with 5 temperature read outs, of which 3 are utilized to measure the temperature at the top, in the middle and at the bottom of the catalyst bed. A synthetic feed consisting of 5 thiophene, 1.6 pyridine, optionally 5 cyclohexene and toluene balance up to 100 is circulated at a constant speed, passes a pre heating coil, with which the temperature is raised to the indicated reaction temperature, and is subsequently led together with hydrogen over the catalyst bed. Alternatively, a mineral oil fraction can be used as feedstock. The catalyst bed consists of 3 g ground and sieved catalyst particles having a particle diameter between 0.25 and 1.0 mm, onto which a bed of 6 g silicon carbide has been applied. The silicon carbide having a particle size distribution which is identical with that of the catalyst serves as pre heating zone and provides for good mixing of the feed with hydrogen. The catalyst is sulphided with 10 H₂S in H₂ before the reaction is started. The sulphided and test conditions are given in Table 2. By GLC techniques, the reaction product is analysed continuously on line. The catalytic activity of a catalyst is determined 12 hours after starting the test on the basis of the hydrodesulphurization of thiophene at 325 C and expressed according to The activity of a catalyst in the hydrodenitrogenization of pyridine was determined 20 hours after starting of the experiment at 375 C and expressed according to The hydrogenating activity on cyclohexene is expressed in a manner identical with that described above for the hydrogenolytic activity on thiophene and pyridine. For hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation the relative activity is expressed with respect to a reference catalyst according to When hydrotreating mineral oil fractions, e.g. light cycle oil and or light gas oil , the RWA is calculated, assuming pseudo higher order kinetics n is at least 1 using the following equation An analogous equation applies for calculation of RWA for HDN. RVA s can be calculated as follows The sulphiding procedure for the catalysts when hydrotreating realistic feedstocks is the same as described in Table I.
