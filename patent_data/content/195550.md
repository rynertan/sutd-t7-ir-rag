# Water absorbing polymers.

## Abstract
A slurry or cake is converted to a crumbly state by admixture, in the absence of a polymeric binder, with water swellable, cross linked, non sticky, wholly synthetic polymer particles formed of a polymer of acrylic acid as free acid or water soluble salt with cross linking agent and, optionally, acrylamide and or other monomers.
