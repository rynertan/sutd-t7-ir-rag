# Novel isolates of trichoderma, fungicidal compositions containing said isolates and use thereof.

## Abstract
A biological control agent comprising the mycoparasite Trichoderma harzianum T 315 ATCC No. 20671 , which is characterized by fungicidal activity against fungi of the genera Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium and Fusarium. This strain is useful for controlling damping off, root rot, crown rot and neck rot in seedling corps. This strain is also resistent to chemical pesticides and soil sterilants and useful for integrated biological and chemical control of soil borne pathogens. A biological control agent comprising the mycoparasite Trichoderma harzianum T 35 ATCC No. 20691 , which is characterized by fungicidal activity against fungi of the genus Fusarium. This strain is useful for protecting most crops affected by the fungus Fusarium spp. and is more active than other previously disclosed strains. Biocontrol compositions containing either or both of the T. harzianum strains of this invention provide antifugal protection to a broad spectrum of plants.
