While there are ports at about 6.3X, most of the voidage in the zeolite is available only to molecules smaller than about 5.92. The Applicants believe therefore that zeolite Nu 23 will be useful for separating cyclic molecules having a size in the range 5 to 6.3A from each other and from larger molecules. Having ports of this size range, the zeolite is also likely to be useful as a component of a catalyst, for example in alkylbenzene lsomerisation. Within the above definition of chemical composition, the number of moles of YO2 is typically in the range 5 to 5,000 and zeolite Nu 23 appears to be most readily formed in a state of high purity when the number of moles of Y02 is in the range 25 to 100. This definition includes both freshly prepared zeolite Nu 23 freshly prepared means the product of synthesis and washing, with optional drying, as hereinbefore described and also forms of it resulting from dehydration, and or calcination, and or ion exchange.In freshly prepared zeolite Nu 23, M may include an alkali metal cation, especially sodium, and or ammonium, and always includes nitrogen containing organic bases, such as cyclohexane derivatives or cationic degradation products thereof, or precursors thereof, or mixtures of such compounds. These bases are hereinafter referred to as Q. Thus a zeolite Nu 23 as made typically has the following molar composition 0.5 to 1.5 H2 nO 0.2 to 130 Q 203 10 to 5,000 Y02 O to 20,000 H2 The H20 content of freshly prepared zeolite Nu 23 depends on the conditions in which it has been dried after synthesis. In calcined forms of zeolite Nu 23, M may be alkali metal or alkaline earth metal but includes less or no base containing organic compounds, since these are burnt out in the presence of air, leaving hydrogen as the other balancing cation. Among the ion exchanged forms of zeolite Nu 23 the ammonium no4 form is of importance since it can be readily converted to the hydrogen form by calcination. The hydrogen form can also be prepared directly by exchange with an acid. This. invention also comprises a method of making zeolite Nu23 which comprises reacting an aqueous mixture containing at least one oxide Y02, at least one oxide X203, and at least one organic compound selected from cyclohexylamine and derivatives thereof, the organic compound s having the formulaEMI4.1 where R1 to K5 which can be the same or different are selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, C1 to C4 alkyl, and are preferably hydrogen or methyl and R6 is selected from hydrogen and C1 to C4 alkyl, and is preferably hydrogen or methyl. The reaction mixtures preferably have the following molar composition Y02 X203 10, preferably in the range 10 to 10,000, more preferably in the range 25 to 100 H20 Y02 ,10, preferably in the range 10 to 200, more preferably in the range 15 to 50 Q O2 ,O.l0, preferably in the range 0.01 to 1.5, more preferably in the range 0.20 to 1.0 2 n A YO2 0.2, preferably in the range 0.4 to 0.8 where A is a chloride or sulphate anion 0E Y02 0.05, preferably in the range 0.05 to 0.5, more preferably in the range 0.05 to 0.3 1120 oR ,100, preferably in the range 100 to 1,000, more preferably in the range 120 to 700 where Y is silicon and or germanium, and or phosphorus andX is aluminium, and or gallium and or boron. OH includes free alkali. The preferred alkali metal M is sodium. The preferred oxide Y02 is silica SiO2 and the preferred oxide X203 is alumina Al203 . The preferred organic compound is cyclohexylamine. The silica source can be any of those commonly considered for use in synthesising zeolites, for example powdered solid silica, silicic acid, colloidal silica or dissolved silica. Among the powdered silicas usable are precipiated silicas, especially those made by precipitation from an alkali metal silicate solution, such as the type known as KS 300 made by AKZO, and similar products, aerosil silicas, fume silicas and silica gels suitable in grades for use in reinforcing pigments for rubber or silicone rubber. Colloidal silicas of various particle sizes may be used, for example 10 to 15 or 40 to 50 microns, as sold under the Registered Trade Marks LUDOX , NALCOAG and SYTON .The usable dissolved silicas include commercially available waterglass silicates containing 0.5 to 6.0, especially 2.0 to 4.0 mols, of SiO2 per mol of alkali metal oxide, active alkali metal silicates as defined in UK Patent 1,193,254, and silicates made by dissolving silica in alkali metal hydroxide or quaternary ammonium hydroxide or a mixture thereof. The alumina source is most conveniently sodium aluminate, but can be or include an aluminium or aluminium salt for example the chloride, nitrate or sulphate or alumina itself, which should preferably be in a hydrated or hydratable form such as colloidal alumina, pseudoboehmite, boehmite, gamma alumina or the alpha or beta hydrate. The reaction mixture is reacted under autogeneous pressure or with added nitrogen pressure if desired, at temperatures between85 to 250 C until crystals of zeolite Nu 23 form, which can be from 1 hour to many months depending on the reactant composition and the operating temperature. Agitation is optional, but preferable since it reduces the reaction time. At the end of the reaction, the solid phase is collected on a filter and washed and is then ready for further steps such as drying, dehydration and ion exchange. If the product of the reaction contains alkali metal ions, these have to be at least partly removed in order to prepare the hydrogen form of Nu 23 and this can be done by ion exchange with an acid, especially a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or by way of the ammonium compound, made by ion exchange with a solution of an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride. Such ion exchange can be carried out by slurrying once or several times with the solution.The zeolite is usually calcined after ion exchange and may be calcined before or between stages. In general, the cation s of zeolite Nu 23 can be replaced by any cation s of metals, and particularly those in Groups IA, IB,IIA, IIB, III including rare earths VIII including noble metals and by lead, tin and bismuth. The Periodic Table is as in Abridgments of Specifications published by the U.K. Patent Office .Exchange is carried out using any water soluble salts containing the appropriate cation. In order to prepare a catalyst, zeolite Nu 23 can be incorporated in an inorganic matrix, with other materials which can be either inert or catalytically active. The matrix may be present simply as a binding agent to hold the small zeolite particles 0.005 to 10 microns together, or it may be added as a diluent to control the amount of conversion in a process which may otherwise proceed at too high a rate, leading to catalyst fouling as a result of excessive coke formation.Typical inorganic diluents include catalyst support materials such as alumina, silica and kaolinic clays, bentonites, montmorillonites, seplolite, attapulgite, Fullers earth, synthetic porous materials such as SiO2 A1203, SiO2 ZrO2, SiO2 Th02, SiO2 3eO, SiO2 TiO2 or any combination of these oxides. An effective way of mixing zeolite Nu Z3 with such diluents is to mlx appropriate aqueous slurries in a mixing nozzle and then to spray dry the slurry.Other ways of mixing can be used. Zeolite Nu 23 may be used in the separation of organic compounds for example mixtures of hydrocarbons, for example mixtures of xylene isomers and it may be used as a catalyst, for example in processes for the production or conversion of hydrocarbons, for example in the alkylation or disproportionation of aromatic hydrocarbons.Processes in which the zeolite may be used include the methylation of toluene, the disproportionation of toluene to form benzene and xylenes, the conversion of methanol and or dimethyl ether to hydrocarbons, and the isomerisation of alkylbenzenes, for example xylenes. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Zeolite Nu 23 was prepared from a reaction mixture having the following molar composition. 2.74Na20 21.lQ A1203 26.2six 659H20 15.6NaCl 73g KS 300 silica 5.09Na20 At263 728six2 24.8E20 were dispersed in 450g water containing 38g sodium chloride. Next 8g sodium aluminate 1.22 Na2O A1203 1.18H20 and 4.6g sodium hydroxide in 42g water were stirred into the silica suspension. Finally 88g cyclohexylamine were stirred in and the mixture was reacted at 1500C for 4 days in a stirred stainless steel autoclave.The slurry product was filtered and washed three times, each time with one litre of distilled water, and then dried overnight at 1200C. The product was highly crystalline sodium cyclohexylamine Nu 23 having the characteristic X ray data shown in Table L columns 1 and 2 and a molar composition of 0.67 Na20 0.54 cyclohexylamina A1203 22Si02 11.2H20 EXAMPlE 2 The product of example 1 was calcined in air saturated with water at .250C for 48 hours at 450eC. The resulting sodium hydrogenNu 23 had the X ray data shown in Table 1 columns 3 and 4. While this data shows that only minor changes occur on calcination, these do result in some significant intensity changes and in shifts in peak positions.The calcined Nu 23 was slurry exchanged with 5ml N hydro chloric acid per g of zeolite for I hour at 600C, and then washed with distilled water twice using 10ml water per g of zeolite. Finally the hydrogen Nu 23 was dried overnight at 1200C and then calcined for 3 hours at 4500C in moist air. This product had X ray data identical with that of sodium hydrogen Nu 23 and had the following molar composition ignoring hydrogen and O.lZw carbon.0.01 Na2O 1203 24Si02. Table 2 gives sorption results obtained at 250C on hydrogenNu 23. These results show that H Nu 23 has a dual port system, one b set of ports of aperture about 6.3A and the other ports having o apertures less than 5.9A.
