# A BALANCED ENHANCEMENT DEPLETION MODE GALLIUM ARSENIDE BUFFER COMPARATOR CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A complementary depletion enhancement mode CDEM Gallium Arsenide circuit utilizes switching pull up pull down circuits to achieve low power consumption, and makes use of gallium arsenide field effect transistors to achieve high speed. High yield depletion mode field effect transistors are used to implement the sometimes complex complementary logic function in a pass gate configuration. Low yield enhancement mode FETs are used in the closely coupled and spaced tracking circuit. Closely spaced enhancement mode FETs are used because of the likelihood of their having closely matched thresholds.
