# Apparatus and method for adjusting the receivers of data transmission channels.

## Abstract
Filters are provided at the outputs of data transmission links to overcome attenuation distortion and phase distortion but such filters tend to increase the noise content of received signals. In the present invention a filter 17 coupled to a linear baseband channel 10 is constrained to be an all pass network, thus avoiding any noise enhancement at its output. The filter 17 is adjusted by means of a channel estimator 19 and an adjustment system 20 to give the channel plus the filter an impulse response that rises rapidly to its peak, thus simplify ing the detection process needed for a satisfactory tolerance to noise. The required response is obtained by finding those roots zeros of the z transform of the sampled impulse response of the channel, which have a modulus greater than some given value which is not less than unity, and adjusting the said filter such that, in the z transform of the sampled impulse response of the channel and filter, the said roots are replaced by the complex conjugates of their reciprocals, the remaining roots of the channel z transform being left unchanged.
