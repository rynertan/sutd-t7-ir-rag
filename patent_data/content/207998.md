## Description
DESCRIPTION NC DATA CREATION METHODTechnical Field This invention relates to a method of creating NC data. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of creating NC data in which macros for deciding auxiliary machining data such as a tool, spindle rotational speed, cutting velocity and cutting conditions are prepared separately of a processing program for NC data creation.Background Art Automatic programming systems have come into practical use and are utilized to create an NC tape NC program data from a design drawing through a simple operation by entering data in a conversational mode using a graphic display screen. If final part dimensions written on the design drawing, workpiece material, auxiliary machining data and the like are specified, the automatic programming system will automatically create an NC tape for performing machining in accordance with the final part profile.Further, with such an automatic programming system, referential information is graphically displayed on the screen from time to time and prompts are made in ordinary language, so that dimensions and various data can be entered in simple fashion in response to the prompts. Conventionally, the auxiliary machining data such as the tool number of the tool used, the rotational speed of the spindle, cutting velocity and cutting conditions, which are necessary for creating the NC data, are entered by an operator using a keyboard or decided automatically under the control of a processing program. In the case where the operator determines the data, however, considerable skill is required and programming is troublesome. Accordingly, systems having a function for deciding the auxiliary machining data automatically are increasing in number. There are occasions when there is a need for NC program data created by a method suited to the machine tool of a particular user s company, or for NC data program that reflects the know how possessed by a user with regard to use of a machine tool. For this reason, there are cases where the maker of the system is requested to alter the method of deciding the auxiliary machining data, such as the tool number of the tool used, the rotational speed of the spindle, cutting velocity and cutting conditions necessary for creating the NC program data, so that method will conform to a particular machine tool or to the needs of the user. In an automatic programming system that creates NC data by automatically deciding the auxiliary machining data, such a request is dealt with by remaking the entirety of the processing program for NC data creation in such a manner that the auxiliary machining data will be decided in accordance with the method requested. However, creating the entirety of a processing program anew is a complicated operation and results in higher costs. In addition, a considerable period of time is needed to create the program, thus making it difficult to comply with the user s request promptly. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an NC data creation method which does not require that a processing program be revised in its entirety when there is a change in the method of deciding auxiliary machining data.Disclosure of the Invention Among data necessary for creating NC data, at least shape date are entered in a conversational mode.A processing program for creating NC data automatically using the shape data and the like, and macros for deciding auxiliary machining data necessary for NC data creation are stored in advance in an internal memory of an automatic programming apparatus. The auxiliary machining data are, by way of example, the tool used, spindle rotational speed, cutting velocity and cutting conditions. The macros stored in the memory for each item of auxiliary machining data include a macro for deciding the tool used, a macro for deciding the rotational speed of the spindle, a macro for deciding the cutting velocity, and a macro for deciding the cutting conditions amount of clearance, depth of cut, finishing margin, amount of relief, etc. . At a step of deciding prescribed auxiliary data following entry of the shape data and other necessary data, a macro corresponding to the auxiliary data is read out of the memory under the control of the processing program. Thereafter, the macro decides the auxiliary data by using data entered previously or data previously decided. When the shape data and all the necessary auxiliary machining data have been decided through the foregoing processing, the processing program uses these shape data and auxiliary data to create NC data for performing machining in accordance with the inputted shape.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an automatic programming apparatus for practicing the NC data creation method according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an external view of the automatic programming apparatus Fig. 3 is a view for describing the shape of a hole Fig. 4 is a flowchart of processing Fig. 5 is a view for describing what is stored in a RAM within the automatic programming apparatus Fig. 6 is a view for describing a tooling file Fig. 7 is a view showing the shapes of drilling and center drilling tools registered in the tooling file Fig. 8 is a flowchart of a tool determining macro Fig. 9 is a view for describing a spindle rotational speed file and Fig. 10 is a flowchart of a spindle determining macro.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an automatic programming apparatus for practicing the NC data creation method according to the present invention, andFig. 2 is an external view of the automatic programming apparatus. A main frame 1 Fig. 2 has a top side provided with a printer 2 and a front side provided with a CRT display unit 3. Disposed in front of the CRT display unit 3 is a keyboard 4 on which there are provided an array of keys 4a such as character keys, numeric keys and function keys. Disposed at the side of the CRT display unit 3 is a floppy disc unit 5. Numeral 2a denotes a recording paper on which printing is performed by the printer 2. FD1, FD2 represent floppy discs. The main frame 1 is provided with a processor 11 Fig. 1 , a ROM 12 and a RAM 13, which are interconnected by a bus line 14. The floppy disc FD1 stores a processing program for NC data creation, and a macro processing program.The floppy disc FD2 stores various macros and various files. It should be noted that a macro is a program having the nature of a subroutine or subprogram for deciding auxiliary machining data such as the tool used, spindle rotational speed, cutting velocity and cutting conditions. There are macros for deciding the tool used, the rotational speed of the spindle, the cutting velocity and the cutting conditions. Files include a tooling file, materials file, spindle rotational speed file and the like. A materials file is composed of a plurality of records.Each record is prepared for a particular material aluminum, stainless steel, etc. and contains several items of cutting condition data amount of clearance, finishing margin, depth of cut, etc. . A tooling file e.g. a tooling file for drilling a hole is composed of a plurality of records, each of which is prepared for a tool. Each record contains data specifying 1 tool type center boring tool, drilling tool, countersinking tool, tapping tool , 2 data specifying tool diameter, 3 data specifying tool length, 4 data particular to each type of tool, and data specifying tool number T code and the like. Let us now describe a method of creating NC data for a case where a hole HL is cut at a predetermined point on a workpiece WK in Fig. 3 by means of a drilling tool. Fig. 3 a is a perspective view, b a plan view and c a sectional view. Though Fig. 3 illustrates a very simple example, the present invention can also be applied to the cutting of a large number of holes and holes of different types. Fig. 4 is a processing flowchart, and Fig. 5 is a view for describing what is stored in the RAM. 1 In executing automatic programming, the floppy disc FDl Fig. 1 is set in the floppy disc unit 5. The floppy disc FDl stores a processing programMNDP see Fig. 5 for creating hole drilling NC data, and a macro processing program MACP hereafter, both processing programs will be referred to collectively as a system program . Next, a loading program stored in the ROM 12 is started to store the system program is a system program storage area 13a Fig. 1 of the RAM 13.The processing program MNDP for NC data creation contains a table TB Fig. 5 indicating the correlation between the name of each item of auxiliary machining data tool number, spindle rotational speed, cutting velocity, cutting conditions and the name of a macro. 2 Next, the floppy disc FD2 is set in the flopply disc unit 5 and each macro is stored in a macro storage area 13b Fig. 1 of RAM 13 under the control of the system program. As shown in Fig. 5, each macro is composed of a macro name e.g. MACRO A, MACRO B,MACRO C ... , a macro body and a code MEND signifying the end of the macro. In parallel with the processing for storing each macro in the storage area 13b, corresponding relationships between macro names and the leading addresses of the storage area storing the macros designated by the macro names are stored in a point section 13c. In other words, if we let Al1 A2,A3... represent the leading addresses of the macros MACRO A, MACRO B, MACRO C ..., then corresponding relationships will be stored in the point section 13c in the manner shown in Fig. 5. The foregoing makes it possible to execute processing for the creation of NC program data. It is followed by specifying hole shape hole depth D and diameter , hole position, hole type and the like in a conversational mode under the control of the system program. The necessary auxiliary machining data are decided automatically. Let us now describe this processing for a case where drilling is performed. 3 First, the type of hole HL see Fig. 3 is inputted. Since the type of hole in this case is a drilled hole, this fact is inputted. 4 Next, the processor 11 causes a prompt regarding the diameter of the hole HL to appear on the display screen. The operator responds by referring to the design drawing and inputting the diameter from the keyboard. When the processing for specifying hole diameter is completed, the processor then causes a prompt D calling for the depth D of the hole HL to appear on the display screen. The operator responds by referring to the design drawing and inputting the depthD from the keyboard. These steps constitute a hole dimensions input step. 5 Thereafter, the processor ila causes a prompt X calling for the X coordinate of the hole HL to appear on the display screen. If the operator responds by inputting a hole coordinate x0 along the X axis using the keyboard 4, then a prompt Y t calling for the Y coordinate of the hole will appear on the display screen. Thereafter, and in similar fashion, the Y coordinate y0 and Z coordinate z0 of the hole are inputted from the keyboard 4. 6 Next, the processor causes the display screen to display an inquiry as to whether there is a hole of the same type and same dimensions as the hole HL. If there is, the position of the hole is inputted if not, the program proceeds to the next step. 7 When processing for specifying hole positions and hole dimensions has been completed for all holes of the same type and dimensions, the processor 11 causes a prompt requesting the material of the workpiece WK to appear on the display screen. The operator responds by inputting the workpiece material. For example, the names of the materials are displayed on the display screen along with menu numbers and a workpiece material is specified by inputting the prescribed menu number from the keyboard 4. 8 When the processing for specifying the material ends, the processor causes a prompt T regarding the tool used to appear on the display screen. 9 In response to the prompt, the operator determines whether the tool is to be decided automatically. 10 If the tool used is not to be decided automatically, then the tool number t a numerical value of the tool used is inputted from the keyboard.This will end the processing for specifying the tool. 11 If the tool used is to be decided automatically, the operator presses an automatic decision key on the keyboard. 12 In response to pressing of the automatic decision key, the processing program MNDP Fig. 5 forNC data creation retrieves the macro name e.g. MACROA that decides the tool from the table TB MACRO A NAME and thereafter turns over control to the macro processing program MACP. 13 Next, the macro processing program MACP checks whether the macro having the macro name NAME has been stored in the storage area 13b. This is to take into account the fact that if the storage area 13b has a small capacity, not all of the macros may have been read out to the storage area 13b. 14 If the macro is not stored in the storage area 13b, the unnecessary macros are removed and, in their place, the macro designated by NAME is read in from the floppy disc FD2. 15 Thereafter, the leading address A1 of the storage area storing the macro given by NAME is retrieved from the pointer section 13c 16 From this point onward, processing for deciding the tool used is performed by successively reading out the instructions constituting the macro starting from address A1 until the code indicating the macro end MEND is sensed. When the macro end MEND is sensed, processing for deciding the tool used ends and the macro processing program MACP returns control to the processing program MNDP for NC data creation. The macro will be described later. 17 When the tool used has been decided, the processor causes a prompt S regarding the rotational speed of the spindle to appear on the display screen. Spindle rotational speed S is then decided through processing similar to that of step 9 16 . 18 When the spindle rotational speed S has been decided, the processor causes a prompt F regarding the cutting velocity to appear on the display screen. Cutting velocity is then decided through processing similar to that of step 9 16 . 19 When the auxiliary machining data have been decided in the foregoing manner, the processor uses the hole position data and auxiliary machining data to perform well known NC data creation processing in order to create NC program data for hole cutting by successively positioning the prescribed tool at the hole positions. Each macro for deciding the auxiliary machining data will now be described. Figs. 6 through 8 are views useful in describing a macro for deciding the tool used. Fig. 6 is a view for describing a tooling file, Fig. 7 is a view for describing each of the drilling tools registered in the tooling file, and Fig. 8 is a flowchart of a macro for deciding the tool used. As shown in Fig. 6, the tooling file is composed of a T code tool number code , a tool type drilling, center drilling ... , a tool diameter DT , a tool length LT and data specifying an applicable workpiece material, all for each tool. The tools indicated by tool numbers 1 5 have the shapes illustrated in Figs. 7 a e , respectively. If a hole having a hole diameter 10 and a hole depth D 12 is to be cut in the workpiece of material b by a drilling tool, then the tool used is decided in the following manner, with reference being had to the flowchart of Fig. 8 1 Inftialization is performed by the operation 1 i, and a flag F is set to O . 2 Next, data indicative of an i th tool is read out of the tooling file and it is checked whether the i th tool is a drilling tool. If the i th tool is not for drilling, the program skips to a step 10 so that processing from that point onward is executed. 3 If the i th tool is a drilling tool, then it is checked whether DT ç holds. When DT d holds, the program skips to step 10 so that processing from that point onward is executed. 4 If DT holds, however, then it is checked whether LT D holds. If LT D holds, the program skips to a step 10 so that processing from that point onward is executed. 5 When LT D holds, it is checked whether the material of the workpiece to which the i th tool is to be applied is b. If the material is not b, then the program skips to a step 10 so that processing from that point onward is executed. 6 If the workpiece is b, then it is checked whether the flag F is 0 . 7 If the flag is 0 , then the T code of the i th tool is stored in memory, the tool diameter DT of the tool is stored as DTminr the flag F is set to 1 , and processing is executed from step 10 onward. 8 If the flag is 1 , on the other hand, the tool diameter DT of the. i th tool and the stored DTmin are compared in magnitude. 9 If DT DTmin is found to hold in the abovementioned comparison operation, then no action is taken and processing is executed from step 10 onward.If DT DTmin is found to hold, the tool diameter of the i th tool is construed to be closest to the diameter the T code thereof is used to update the previously stored T code, and the operation DT H DTmin is performed. 10 Next, i is incremented by the operation i l i. all Thereafter, it is checked whether i n holds, where n is the number of tools registered in the tool file. If i n holds, processing is executed from step 2 onward if i n holds, the tool decided upon as the tool used is that designated by the stored T code. Among the tool diameters equal to or smaller than the hole diameter, the tool having the diameter closest to the hole diameter is selected through the foregoing processing. Figs. 9 and 10 are views for describing a macro that decides spindle rotational speed. Fig. 9 is a view for describing a spindle rotational speed file and illustrates the correlation among workpiece materials, tools and spindle rotational speeds. Fig. 10 is a flowchart of a macro for deciding spindle rotational speed. When the workpiece material and tool have been decided, a spindle rotational speed Si is found automatically from the spindle rotational speed file.Accordingly, the spindle rotational speed Sij is obtained from the file by using the material number inputted from the keyboard and the tool number decided by the tool decision macro as keys. Assuming that the cutting velocity F is given as a function of the tool T, material M and spindle rotational speed S, the macro for deciding the cutting velocity F is given as F f T, M, S For instance, if the macro is given by F f S 2 S in a simple example, then the macro for deciding cutting velocity need only obtain F from the above equation using the spindle speed S. According to the present invention as described above, it is arranged to input at least shape data in a conversational mode among data necessary for creatingNC data, store a processing program for automatically creating NC data using the shape data and the like, as well as macros for deciding auxiliary machining data necessary for NC data creation, in a memory beforehand, call a macro corresponding to prescribed auxiliary machining data when the auxiliary machining data are to be decided, decide the auxiliary machining data by using the macro, and create NC data to perform machining in accordance with a desired shape by using the shape data and auxiliary machining data. Accordingly, when a user requests that auxiliary machining data be decided by a special method suited to a machine tool, or when it is requested that the auxiliary machining data be decided based on the user s own know how, these requests can be complied with by modifying solely the macro that decides these auxiliary machining data. It is unnecessary to alter the main processing program. This enables a higher performance cost ratio to be obtained and makes it possible to rapidly provide the automatic programming apparatus requested by the user. According to the present invention, macros corresponding to auxiliary data are stored in memory, thus making it possible to comply with a user s request by modifying only the prescribed macro.
