# Insecticidal synergistic mixtures of 0,0 diethyl 0 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridinyl phosphorothioate and 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid cyano 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl ester and method of killing and controlling insects.

## Abstract
Insecticidal compositions containing a mixture of 0,0 diethyl 0 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridinyl phosphoro thioate and 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid cyano 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl ester are disclosed. Such compositions are useful in the kill and control of insects, particularly insects of the Lepidoptera order and especially of the genus Heliothis.
