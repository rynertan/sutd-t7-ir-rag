## Description
COMPOUNDS AND USE The present invention relates to guanoxabenz and its use in the treatment of diarrhoea and scours. European Patent Application No. 25 269 describes the use in the treatment of diarrhoea and scours of a class of compounds having agonist and vasoconstrictor activity. Surprisingly guanoxabenz, which has agonist and vasoconstrictor activity and falls within that class of compounds, has particular advantages in such treatment. Accordingly the present invention provides, in one aspect a method for treating diarrhoea and scours, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of guanoxabenz or an acid addition salt thereof, to a human or non humananimal in need of such treatment. Alternatively the present invention provides a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition for use in treating diarrhoea or scours, which composition comprises guanoxabenz or an acid addition salt thereof and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier therefor. Guanoxabenz l 2,6 dichlorobenzylideneamino 3hydroxyguanidine is a known compound which is disclosed, together with processes for its production, in UK Patents Nos. 1 253 248 and 1 253 249. Suitable acid addition salts are formed from pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable inorganic and organic acids and include the salts of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, maleic, pamoic and tartaric acids. It is believed that a suitable dose of guanoxabenz, or a salt thereof, for use in the present treatment, would be in the range 0.005 to 100 mg kg, which dose may be repeated as and when required. Particularly suitable ranges include 0.001 to 10 mg kg and 0.05 to l0 mg kg and especially 0.02 to 0.2 and most preferably about 0.05 mg kg. Nevertheless it will be appreciated that the dose used in practice will depend on the species to which the dose is administered and on the route of administration. Pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions of guanoxabenz and acid addition salts thereof hereinafter referred to as the Wdrug will, of course, be adapted for administration to the humans or animals to be treated. Thus, for example, the composition may be a shaped composition, such as a bolus, tablet or capsule. In such cases the pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like. When these shaped compositions are for administration to cattle and pigs often they may for instance weigh at least 1 g,.on occasions at least 2 g. For administration to humans, especially children, the drug may suitably be presented as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers. For veterinary use the composition may also be a dispersion or a solution of the drug in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser this is a well known item of farm equipment, basically comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animals mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected from the reservoir through the mouthpiece . Conveniently the drug may be administered from an oral doser as an aqueous solution.Alternatively, the vehicle will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered. The invention, therefore, also provides an oral doser containing a multi dose of the drug in a veterinarily acceptable vehicle. The drugs of the invention may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. Thus the invention also provides animal feed or animal drinking water containing a compound of formula I . It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions with a multi dose of the drug so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the drug along with its diet. It will also be convenient to present the composition of the invention as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water. With human babies or young animals, a particularly useful technique is to blend the drug with the milk provided for them. The compositions of the invention may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the drug chosen is suitably dissolved in water for injection. Alternatively the drug may be administered in a solution used for parenteral fluid replacement therapy. Treatment of diarrhoea and scours using the druq may be supplemented by oral rehydration therapy such as those described in U.K. Patent No. 1,581,826 and GermanOffenlegungsschrift No. 28 54 281, UK PatentApplication No. 2 012 163A, US Patent No. 3 898 328,Nalin, D.R. and Cash, R.A., Bull. World Health Org., 43, 361 1970 , French Patent No. 2 467 599, UK PatentNo. 1 465 308 and as described in wSecrefory Diarrhoea , Ed M. Field, J.S. Fordtran and S,G,Schultz, American Physiological Society, Maryland, 1980 pp 179 185 and Lancet, 1975 pp 79 and 80.Conveniently the drug may be administered with the oral rehydration formulation. Accordingly the present invention provides, in a particular aspect, a formulation for treating diarrhoea which comprises an effective non toxic amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an oral rehydration composition comprising a pharmacologically acceptable aqueous solution containing at least 0.5 w v of an actively absorbed monosaccharide, at least 25 mM sodium ions and having an osmolarity less than 500 m Osmolar. Preferably the oral rehydration composition further comprises actively absorbed amino acids and electrolytes. The drug may be presented as a formulation containing one or more components of the oral rehydration composition for admixture with the remaining components. Alternatively the drug may be provided separately and administered simultaneously or sequentially with the oral rehydration formulation. Often it will be appropriate to include in the compositions a further medicine such as an antibacterial agent for example an antibiotic such as amoxycillin or neomycin or a sulphonamide such as sulfadoxin, an agent to alter intestinal motility such as loperamide or a material such as pectin. The amount of drug administered must, of course, be sufficient to bring about the desired effect and will also depend on the body weight of the recipient and the chosen route of administration. Useful dosage units based on such dosage would contain from 0.1 mg to 500 mg of the drug, more suitably 0.2 mg to 500 mg. Of course, it will be appreciated that many preferred compositions of the invention are in multi dose form as, for the therapy of animals, it is often most desirable to be able rapidly to treat a number of animals. Such multi dose compositions will contain, by way of example, at least 1 mg of the drug. Depending on the exact nature of the said multi dose composition, often it will contain at least 50 mg of the drug, and on occasions as much as 5 g. Doses may.be administered once or several times daily. The following Formulations illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit the invention in any way. As used in the Formulations the term wDrugw refers to guanoxabenz or an acid addition salt thereof, in particular the hydrochloride salt.

The gel was stirred at 1300C for 15 minutes and then allowed to cool without stirring to room temperature. The milled drug was dispersed in the cooled gel base and then passed through a colloid mill to produce a fine, homogenous dispersion. The dispersion was filled into plastic bottles fitted with a dosing pump.

The Bentone was dispersed in the soya bean oil, and when thoroughly distributed, the propylene carbonate was added with high speed mixing, followed by colloid milling to produce the base. Into this base was first mixed the phosphoric acid, and then the pharmasorb, the penicillin, and the drug and the resultant suspension was then passed through a colloid mill once more.
