# Aminocyclohexanol derivatives having an expectorant activity, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
New esters of N 2 amino 3,5 dibromobenzyl trans 4 aminocyclohexanol, along with certain phenolic derivatives, present interesting expectorant activity, associated with an acute toxicity which is very low. They are, therefore, useful as active principles in pharmaceutical compositions, for oral, topical, injection and rectal use, and are especially indicated for the treatment of bronchial affections.
