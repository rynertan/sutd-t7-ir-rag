## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the production of alkyl trifluoroacetates. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the production of trifluoroacetates with an alkyl group having a low number of carbon atoms, by starting from trifluoroacetyl chloride. The preparation of esters of trifluoroacetic acid starting from trifluoroacetyl chloride is known. In particular, G.D.R. Pat. No. 29, 513 to L. Heinrich discloses the preparation of trifluoroacetic acid alkyl esters. The process disclosed in this patent comprises flowing a mixture of CF₃COF or CF₃COCl, SO₂ and Br₂, in the gaseous state, through alcohol at a purity of 99 , and at temperatures of between 20 C and the boiling temperature of the alcohol, preferably at room temperature. The esterification is carried out in the absence of acid acceptor agents, and the ester produced is separated by pouring the alcoholic solution into a water ice mixture, containing a water insoluble solvent for the ester having a specific gravity higher than 1 kg dm³, and having a boiling point higher by at least 30 C than the ester boiling point. The ester produced is submitted to some purification treatments, e.g, washing with water, neutralization with an aqueous solution of NaHCO₃, drying over CaCl₂, before being sent to the distillation to separate it from the other reaction products. This process suffers from considerable technological drawbacks, which make it not much attractive from the viewpoint of its application on full industrial scale. It has been now surprisingly found by the Applicant, and is the object of the present invention, that the technological drawbacks above mentioned can be eliminated by carrying out the reaction between trifluoroacetyl chloride and an alkyl alcohol of general formula R OH, wherein R is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with a trifluoroacetyl chloride alkyl alcohol molar ratio greater than 1, and recovering the ester formed by condensation at temperatures lower than 30 C. According to a preferred embodiment, the reaction can be carried out with a trifluoroacetyl chloride alkyl alcohol molar ratio comprised within a range of from 1.1 to 2, and preferably of from 1.2 to 1.4. In the process of the present invention, any temperature can be used, although temperatures of from 50 C to 130 C are preferred. In particular, if R is an ethyl group, the temperature is comprised within the range of from 90 C to 100 C, and if R is a methyl group, the temperature is comprised within the range of from 75 C to 85 C. The time of reaction between the reactants is generally very short, and can range from 3 to 60 seconds, preferably from 5 to 10 seconds. The reaction can be carried out indifferently as a continuous, batch, or semi continuous process. In case of a batch process, trifluoroacetyl chloride is fed in gas phase into the alcohol in the liquid state, charged inside a reactor kept at reaction temperature. To the contrary, in case of a continuous process, trifluoroacetyl chloride and the alcohol are fed together, in the vapour phase, to a tubular reactor. The process of the present invention allows the alkyl trifluoroacetate to be obtained at a purity higher than 90 , and of up to 99 , increasing such purity to an end value very close to 100 by rectification being possible. The reaction products leaving the reactor are fed to a partial condensation column kept at temperatures lower than 30 C, wherein the alkyl ester of trifluoroacetic acid condenses. Said alkyl ester is collected in a vessel and is heated to a temperature of from 30 C to 100 C, for the purpose of removing possible residues of hydrogen chloride formed during the reaction, and of unreacted trifluoroacetyl chloride. If the ester produced is the ethyl ester, such a temperature is preferably comprised within the range of from 55 to 60 C, if the ester is methyl ester, such a temperature is preferably comprised within the range of from 35 C to 40 C. The stream of hydrogen chloride formed, and the excess of trifluoroacetyl chloride are sent to a second partial condensation step, at temperatures lower than 50 C, wherein only trifluoroacetyl chloride condenses and is recycled to the esterification reactor. According to an alternative route, unreacted trifluoroacetyl chloride can be recovered also by chemical way, by esterification with a molar excess of the same alkyl alcohol, to obtain the highest possible conversion of trifluoroacetyl chloride. In such an esterification, the alkyl alcohol unreacted trifluoroacetyl chloride molar ratio is comprised within the range of from 1.1 to 1.5, and preferably of from 1.15 to 1.3. The ester produced in such a reaction, containing unreacted alcohol, is condensed and recycled to the esterification reactor. Whether the first or the second recovery method is used, the ester produced has a purity of from 97 to 99 , and can be further purified by rectification, to reach a purity very close to 100 . For a more detailed description of the process of the present invention, reference is made to the diagrams of Figs. 1 and 2. Referring to Fig. 1, to the mixer 4 the alcohol, by the metering pump 1 , and trifluoroacetyl chloride contained in tank 2 are fed the pressure of gas outflowing from 2 is controlled by the pressure regulator 3 . The reactants are fed in vapour phase to reactor 6 , the temperature of which is checked by the temperature indicator 5 . The reaction products are discharged from the reactor bottom, and are sent to the partial condenser 7 for the recovery of the alkyl ester. Condensed ester is collected inside tank 8 , and from there it is sent to the rectification column 10 from which, by a side draw , the product is recovered at a purity level higher than 99.8 . Low boiling and high boiling side products are discharged as the overhead and the bottom fraction respectively. From the head of partial condenser 7 , hydrogen chloride produced during the esterification reaction, and the excess of trifluoroacetyl chloride are sent to a second partial condenser 9 , wherein the condensation occurs of trifluoroacetyl chloride only. This latter is recycled to reactor 6 , after a preliminary vapourization in 4 , whilst hydrogen chloride, still in the gas phase, is discharged to undergo further treatments. Should it be desired to recover the excess of trifluoroacetyl chloride by chemical way rather than by physical way, the products from the esterification reaction are treated by operating according to the diagram shown in Fig. 2. The products outflowing from the top of partial condenser 7 , and constituted of hydrogen chloride and trifluoroacetyl chloride are reacted, after a preliminary vapourization in 14 , with the same alcohol, fed by a second metering pump 11 , inside a secondary esterification reactor 12 . In this case, the alcohol trifluoroacetyl chloride ratio is greater than 1, so to have an as high as possible conversion of trifluoroacetyl chloride. The reaction products and unreacted materials are sent to the partial condenser 9 , at the bottom of which a mixture of ester, alcohol and possibly traces of unreacted trifluoroacetyl chloride are collected and recycled by the pump 13 to the esterification reactor 6 .
