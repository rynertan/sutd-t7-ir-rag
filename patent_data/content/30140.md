These compounds are useful as herbicides and also as intermediates for preparing herbicides. U.S. Patent 4,169,719 reports certainN alkoxyheterocyclic aminocarbonyl aromatic sulfonamides as herbicides,. This patent teaches a method or preparing these herbicides involving the reaction of an arylsulfonyl isocyanate with an alkoxyheterocyclic amine ArSO2NCO H2N alkoxyheterocycle ArS02NHCONH alkoxyheterocycle Due to the increasing need for inexpensive and effective herbicides, there is a definite need for new and efficient processes for preparing these herbicides. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing a herbicidal compound of formulaEMI2.1 wherein A is an optionally substituted homocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic group X is H C1 Br C1 C2 alkyl CF3 CH30 methoxymethyl or CH2CH2OCH3 Y is C1 or Br and Z is CH, N, C C1 or C CH3 characterised in that an aromatic sulfonamideA S02NH2 wherein A is as defined above is contacted with an isocyanate of formulaEMI2.2 wherein Xq Y and are as defined above This process may be illustrated by the following equation EMI2.3 where A, X, Y and Z are as previously defined. The product N haloheterocyclicaminocarbonyl aromatic sulfonamides IV may be further reacted with selected nucleophiles to yield other herbicidal N substituted heterocyclicaminocarbonyl aromatic sulfonamides of the formulae EMI3.1 andEMI3.2 wherein A is an optionally substituted homocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic group X is H, Cl, Br, C1 C2 alkyl, CF3, C.t33, methods methyl or CH2CH20CH3 X is C1 C2 alkyl, CF3, methoxymethyl,CH30 or CH2CH20CH3 E is NR2R3 or Cl C6 alkylthio R is methyl, ethyl,EMI3.3 or CH2C02CH3 R1 is methyl or ethyl and R3 are independently C1 C4 alkyl andZ is CH, N, C Cl or C CH3. The processes for preparing compounds ofFormulas I, II and III may be illustrated bv the following three equations EMI4.1 where A, X, X , E, R, R1, and Z are as previously defined X is Cl or Br and Y is Cl or Br. Detailed Description of the Invention In Formulas I, II, III and IV above, A is an optionally substituted homocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic group. Homocyclic aromatic groups include substituted phenyl and naphthyl. Heterocyclic aromatic groups include furanyl, thienyl and pyridyl. A may be any of, but is not limited to, the following groups EMI5.1 Preferred definitions of A, due to the high herbicidal activity of the product compounds, are the following ortho substituted phenyl naphthyl 2 furanyl 2 thienyl 3 thienyl 2 substituted 3 thienyl 4 substituted 3 thienyl pyridyl ,2 substituted 3 pyridyl The aromatic substituents represented by A may optionally be substituted at any position with any substituent unreactive with isocyanate. Examples of possible bsituents are those shown in the figures above.Compounds of Formulas I,II, III and IV, in whichA is phenyl substituted at the ortho position with carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid amide, more preferably with the latter and most preferably with pyrrolidine carboxamide show impressive herbicidal activity.Reaction Step 1 In the reaction illustrated in Equation 1 , an aromatic sulfonamide is contacted with a heterocyclic isocyanate to yield an N haloheterocyclic aminocarbonylaromatic sulfonamide of Formula IV. The aromatic sulfonamides used in this reaction may be prepared by one or more methods known in the art. The preparation of aromatic sulfonamides from ammonium hydroxide and arylsulfonyl chloride is widely reported in the literature, e.g., Crossley et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60, 2223 1938 . The preparation of furansulfonamides is described inJ. Org. Chem. 18, 894 1953 . Pyridine sulfonamides are described by H. L. Tale in Pyridine and ItsDerivatives Supplement, Part 4 1975 . Thiophenesulfonamides are prepared according to the references cited in Thiophene and Its Derivatives ,H. D. Hartough, Interscience, New York 1952 andA. H. Blatt et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79, 1693 1957 . All of these articles are herein incorporated by reference. The preparation of other homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic suflonamides is also reported in the literature and would be known to one skilled in the art. The heterocyclic isocyanates used in this process may be prepared according to methods described in Swiss Patent 579,062, U.S. Patent 3,919,228, U.S. Patent 3,732,223, and Anew. Chef.Int. Ed. 10, 402 1976 , the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The aromatic sulfonamide and the heterocyclic isocyanate are contacted in the presence of an inert organic solvent, for example, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran THF , toluene, acetone or butanone. Optionally, a catalytic amount of a base, such as 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octae DABCO , potassium carbonate, sodium hydride or potassium tert butoxide, may be added to the reaction mixture. The quantity of base constituting a catalytic amount would be obvious to one skilled in the art. The reaction mixture is preferably maintained at a temperature of about 25 to 1100C, and the product can generally be recovered by cooling and filtering the reaction mixture. For reasons of efficiency and economy, the preferred solvents are acetonitrile and THF, and the preferred temperature range is about 60 to 850C. For reasons of ease of synthesis an or lower cost, the preferred products of the claimed process are those compounds of Formula IV where, independently, X is C1 or Br, Y is C1 and Z is CH or N. More preferred for the same reasons are those com ounds where X and Y are simultaneously C1. Reaction Steps 2 and 3 In Reaction Steps 2 and 3 , one or two of the halogen atoms on the heterocyclic ring of the compound of Formula IV is displaced by a nucleophilic species. Generally, this may be done by contacting the compound of Formula IV with alkoxide, OR, where R is as defined above. It is preferred to contact the compound of Formula IV with at least two equivalents of alkoxie, OR. The alkoxide can be provided in number of ways a The compound of Formula IVcan be suspended or dissolved in an alkanol solvent, ROH, in the presence of at least two equivalents of alkoxide, OR. The alkoxide can be added directly as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxide or can be generated by the addition to the alkanol solvent of at least two equivalents of a base capable of generating alkoxide from the solvent. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, the alkali and alkaline earth metals, their hydrides and tert butoxides. For example, when R is methyl, the compound of Formula IV could be suspended or dissolved in methanol in the presence of two equivalents of sodium methoxide.Alternatively, two equivalents of sodium hydride could be used in place of the sodium methoxide. b The compound of Formula IV can be suspended or dissolved in an inert solvent in the presence of at least two equivalents of alkoxide, OR. Suitable inert solvents include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile, THF and dimethylformamide. The alkoxide may be added directly as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxide or may be generated from alkanol and a base as described in a above. For example, when R is methyl, the compound of Formula IV could be suspended or dissolved in THF in the presence of two equivalents of sodium methoxide. Alternatively, two equivalents each of methanol and sodium hydride could be used instead of sodium methoxide.For reasons of economy and efficiency, procedure a is the more preferred method. It should be noted that two equivalents of alkoxide are required for Reaction Step 2 . This is due to the reaction which is believed to occur between the alkoxide and the sulfonyl nitrogen of the sulfonamide of Formula IV. When alkoxide is used, the first equivalent of alkoxide removes a proton from the sulfonyl nitrogen, and it is only the second equivalent which effects displacement of the halogen. As a result, two equivalents of alkoxide are required. The resulting salt must be acidified, e.g., with sulfuric, hydrochloric or acetic acid, to yield a compound of Formula I.Applicant, of course, does not intend to be bound by the mechanism described above. In Reaction Step 3 a compound of Formula I a, substituted with at least one displaceable group, is contacted with two equivalents of alkoxide, OR1, whereR1 is as described above. The compound of Formula I a is prepared according to Reaction Step 2 from a compound of Formula IV where X is C1 or Br. The alkoxide, OR1, may be provided in either of the methods described above in connection with Reaction Step 3 , and the resulting salt can be acidified to yield a compound ofFormula II. When R R1, Reaction Steps 2 and 3 may be combined. Thus, a compound of Formula IV may be contacted with at least three equivalents of alkoxide, OR. When a compound of Formula IV contains two displadeable groups, e.g., both X and Y are C1 or Br, certain reaction conditions will favor displacement of only one of the group. These conditions are the use of low temperatures and the slow addition of the stoichiometric amount of alkoxide or alkoxide generating base to the medium containing the compound of Formula IV. Both reaction Steps 2 and 3 are preferably run at temperatures within the range of about 10 to 800C, the range of about 0 to 500C being more preferred. Due to ease of synthesis and or lower cost, the preferred products of Reaction Steps 2 and 3 are those compounds of Formula I and Formula II where Z isCH or N. More preferred are those preferred compounds of Formulas I and II where X is C1 C2 alkyl and R is methyl or ethyl. Most preferred are those more preferred compounds where R R1.Reaction Step 4 Reaction Step 4 involves the displacement of the halogen atom in a compound of Formula IV a by dialkylamino or alkylthio nucleophiles. The starting material, a compound of Formula IV a, is prepared as in Equation 1 , and X is limited to C1 C2 alkyl, CF3, CH30, 2 methoxyethyl and methoxymethyl. For this reaction, the compound of Formula IV a is suspended or dissolved in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile or THF. At least one equivalent of the nucleophilic species and at least two equivalents of a base are then contacted with the starting material. The first equivalent of base is believed to neutralize the sulfonamido proton. The second equivalent of base generates mercaptide or NR2R3 from the mercaptan or the dialkylamine. Suitable bases include sodium hydride, sodium methoxide and sodium hydroxide. Suitable reaction temperatures are within the range of about 10 to 800C, with a range of about 0 to 500 being preferred. The product may be isolated by dilution of the reaction mixture with water, mild acidification and filtration. Due to ease of synthesis and or lower cost, the preferred products of Reaction Step 4 are those compounds of Formula III where X is methyl or ethyl,E is CH3S, CH3CH2S, CH3 2 or CH3CH2 2N, and Z is CH or N.
