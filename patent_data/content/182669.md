Chloride, methyl sulfate and ethyl sulfate are particularly preferred anions. The alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds are prepared by quaternization of an alkoxylated tertiary amine of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are as herein above described, with an alkylating agent designated herein as R6A wherein R6 and AO are as hereinabove described. A general postulated equation for the reaction to prepare the alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds of the present invention may be represented as follows with R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, X and A as above described.EMI4.2 alkoxylated tertiary alkylating quaternary ammonium amine agent compoundA wide variety of alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds can be prepared according to the invention. The reaction may be carried out at temperatures in the range of from about 25C to 1500C, preferably from 600C to lO0 C with temperatures of approximately 700C more preferred, and pressures of from about l atmosphere to 200 psig, preferably 50 to 100 psig with 60 psig most preferred.The ratio of total amine whether pure alkoxylated tertiary amine or a tertiary amine containing some alkoxylated secondary amineEMI4.3 and alkoxylated primary amineEMI4.4 impurities to alkylating agent R6A is 1 3 preferably 1 1. When the alkoxylated tertiary amine to be quaternized does contain secondary and or primary amine impurities the quaternization reaction is generally carried out in the presence of from 1 to 50, preferably from 2 to 5 wt. 8 based on the total reaction mixture of an organic base material such as an alkaline earth metal or alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, etc. which acts as a scavenger for the acid produced during the reaction and helps force the reaction to completion. If desired, the quaternization reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent, such as water, alcohols, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc, ethers, for examole diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene etc., as well as the alkanes, for example, hexane, heptane, pentane, etc. The alkoxylated tertiary amines employed to prepare the alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds of the present invention may be obtained by amination of an oxyalkylated alcohol with a secondary amine in the presence of an amination catalyst as is described in the above noted co pending application. The oxyalkylation reaction is conducted by methods well known in the art by reacting an appropriate alcohol such as, for example, methanol, etc. or the short chain plasticizer range linear Ziegler type alcohols containing various mixtures of C6 through C10 alcohols with an alkylene oxide, such as propylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal or alkaline earth catalyst as taught, for example inU. S. Patent Nos. 2,508,035 2,617,830 2,671,115 and 3,382,285 and incorporated herein by reference. Typical of such Ziegler alcohols, which are also employed in the instant invention, are the EPAL 810 or 610 and ALGOL 810 or 610 types which are mixtures of predominately C8 andC10 straight chain alcohols sold commercially, for example, by the Ethyl Corporation and the Continental Oil Company respectively. The alcohols which may be reacted with the alkylene oxides to prepare the oxyalkylated alcohols for further processing include any aliphatic or branched monohydric alcohol containing from 1 to 11 carbon atoms, cyclic alcohols, aryl alcohols as well as aralkyl and alkaryl alcohols as defined by R in the above formula. Representative alcohols include, for example, methyl, ethyl, n ,iso , sec , and tert butyl, amyl, hexyl, octyl, nonyl, n and isopropyl, decyl, and benzyl alcohols, cyclohexanol, 2ethyl hexanol, methyl cyclohexanol, 3 methyl butanol, 1heptanol and the like or mixtures thereof. The alkylene oxides which may be employed to prepare the oxyalkylated alcohols include, for example, ethylene and propylene oxide and the higher alkylene oxides, i.e., one containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred among the oxides is propylene oxide. Illustrative higher alkylene oxides include, for example, 1,2 epoxybutane, 1,2 epoxypentane, 5 methyl 1,2 epoxyheptane, 1,2 epoxyoctane, 2,4,4 trimethyl 2,3 ePoxypentane, 1,2 epoxynonane, 1,2 epoxydecane, 1,2 epoxydodecane, and the like or mixtures thereof. In general, the oxyalkylated alcohol formation with, for example propylene oxide, is carried out at temperatures in the range of from about 700C to 1500C preferably 900C to 100C under moderately elevated pressures of from about atmospheric to 500 psig, preferably from 50 to 100 psig, and in the presence of between about 0.01 to 1, preferably Q.2 to 0.3 weight of total reactants of an alkalinereacting material or catalyst such as sodium, potassium, calcium, barium and strontium hydroxides. In general a controlled amount of an alkylene oxide or admixture thereof is slowly contacted with the alcohol reactant for a period ranging up to about 20 hours in an amount sufficient to prepare the desired oxyalkylated reaction product mixture.On completion of the oxyalkylation reaction, the crude reaction product containing the catalyst is normally treated with an inorganic acid or acid forming material to neutralize the reaction product after which is filtered to produce a finished oxyalkylated product. If desired the oxyalkylation of the alcohol may be carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent such as toluene, benzene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, heptane, hexane, pentane, octane, etc. which are free of water. Preparation of the alkoxylated tertiary amine involves the novel process of aminating the oxyalkylated alcohol with a secondary amine in the presence of from about 0.5 to 20 weight , preferably 2.5 to 10 weight of amination catalyst based on the total reaction mixture.Any amination catalyst known in the art may be employed, such as, for example, Raney Nickel, supported nobel metals, and catalysts containing Cu, Cr and promoters such as nickel, however, catalysis containing CuO and Cr203 in various ratios, Cu Cr supported on magnesium aluminate spinel and ruthenium on activated carbon are preferred catalysts. The secondary amines which may be used to aminate the oxyalkylated alcohol include, for example, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di n propylamine, di ipropylamine, di n butylamine, di n amylamine, di n hexylamine, di n octylamine, di n nonylamine, di n decylamine, di i octylamine, di benzylamine, di methylbenzyl amine, di ethylbenzyl amine, dicyclohexylamine, dicyclopentylamine, and diallylamine. The amination reaction of oxyalkylated alcohols employing second amines is conducted at a temperature within the range of from about 1500C to 3250C with a preferred range being from 1750C to 2750C. The pressure may be varied from about 50 psig to 3000 psig with the preferred range being 100 psig to 250 psig. Although not required, solvents, if desired, which are chemically inert to the components of the reaction system may be employed in the reductive amination reaction.Suitable solvents include, for example, heptane, pentane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. The following Examples are provided to illustrate the present invention in accordance with the principles of this invention but are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way except as indicated by the appended claims.
