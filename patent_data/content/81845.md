# Escape slide system and method of operation.

## Abstract
A packboard assembly 10 has a shell 12 in which the escape slide is packed and held in place by releasably fastened covers 28, 29 . The shell 12 is mounted on a door and supported by latches 52 having latch pins 62 which when removed cause the assembly 10 to drop. The latch pins 62 are removed in response to opening of the door after the escape slide system is actuated by an operator. Then after the packboard assembly 10 is dropped a predetermined distance a packing release lanyard 68 is tensioned to release the covers 28, 29 and permit the shell 12 to fall away from the slide. A firing lanyard 78 then actuates the inflation of the slide.
