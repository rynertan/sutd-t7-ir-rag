# A device for indicating the position of a printer carriage.

## Abstract
In a printer comprising a printing head which is sup ported by a carriage 5 the carriage position along a re cord carrier is sensed at two occasions. A belonging micro processor 12 calculates an actual carriage speed on ba sis of the position values which are obtained. The actual carriage speed and an optimal carriage speed which is stored, are compared and on basis of this comparison and a compensation factor is calculated for a reference signal Ref which determines the carriage speed. This compen sation factor is checked at each carriage movement by measuring the carriage speed, and thereby a permanently optimal carriage speed is secured and the need of an ac curate trimming of the carriage speed is eliminated at the manufacture as well as at later service actions.
