# A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device has the steps of forming a first thin single crystal semicon ductor layer 102 on a semiconductor substrate 101 of one conductivity type which contains oxygen, the first thin sing le crystal semiconductor layer 102 having a higher resis tivity than that of the semiconductor substrate 101 and having the same conductivity type as that of the semicon ductor substrate 101 ion implanting an electrically inac tive impurity in the first thin single crystal semiconductor layer 102 forming a second thin single crystal semicon ductor layer 104 on the first thin single crystal semicon ductor layer 102 , the second thin single crystal semicon ductor layer 104 having the same conductivity type as that of the semiconductor substrate 101 and having a higher resistivity than that of the semiconductor substrate 101 performing annealing for not less than four hours at a tem perature of 550 C to 900 C after the electrically inactive impurity is ion implanted and forming a cell of a dynamic random access memory in the second thin single crystal semiconductor layer 104 , the cell having one transistor and one capacitor.
