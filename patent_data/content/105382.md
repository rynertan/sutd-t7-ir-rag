# IMAGE FORMING PHOTO SENSITIVE MATERIAL.

## Abstract
An image forming photo sensitive material utilizing changes in adherence due to light, wherein an alloxazine derivative represented by the following formula I , wherein R s may be the same or different from each other and each represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a phenylalkyl group represented by the formula II , wherein n represents an integer of 1 or above is used as a photopolymerization initiator. In order to enable the photo sensitive material to reproduce intermediate gradation of an image, the photo sensitive material is provided with a composite structure wherein a photo sensitive layer addi tionally containing a tertiary amine as a sensitizer is provided on a hardened layer formed by hardening a photo sensitive composition. This photo sensitive material can be used as a copying material for recording and reproducing a picture image from a cathode ray tube or a fiber tube.
