# A method of retrieving character symbol data elements for a display and apparatus therefore.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for addressing a character generator memory 23 containing symbols com mon to two or more languages in a common area of the character generator memory. Symbols which are special to the particular language being displayed are stored in one of a plurality of special symbol areas of the character generator memory 23 . One of the special symbol areas contiguous with the common area is identified as a default symbol area. The proper special symbol area of the character generator memory is selected by comparing the high order bits of a display character code with compare bits to determine whether a different special symbol area of the character generator memory is to be substituted for the default area contiguous with the common area. If the compare bits indicate that a different special area of the character generator is to be substituted, the high order bits of the dis play character code are not directly used to address the character generator memory but are replaced by substitution bits to access that special symbol area unique to the language being displayed.
