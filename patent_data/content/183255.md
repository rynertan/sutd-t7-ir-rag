# PASSIVE MOLD COOLING AND HEATING METHOD AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mold 11 for molding articles of plastic or other like materials, having a plurality of vertically extending internal passages 19 , is connected by inlet and return conduits 32, 35 into a closed loop that includes a heat exchanger 20 partially filled with a liquid supply of a cooling fluid or a heating fluid. For cooling the heat exchanger 20 is posi tioned with its liquid level above the top of the mold, the inlet conduit 32 connects the lower part of the heat exchanger 20 , below the liquid level, to the lower ends of the mold passages 19 , and the return conduit 35 connects the upper ends of the mold passages 19 to the upper part of the heat exchanger 20 for heating these relationships are reversed. In operation the fluid changes its physical state at critical points in the mold passages 19 , going from liquid to vapor for cooling and from vapor to liquid for heating circulation in the closed loop is in response to the effect of gravity. Operation of the heat exchanger 20 is controlled to maintain a controlled pressure in the closed loop.
