## Description
Clutch Control Apparatus This invention relates to clutch control apparatus for the automatic control of friction clutches between the engine and transmission of motor vehicles on take up from standing start. In its broadest aspect the present invention provides an automatic clutch control system in which there is provided means for generating a constant, varying, or variable reference signal for comparison with an engine speed signal and clutch position control means. Accordingly, there is provided a vehicle transmission clutch control system comprising an electrical engine speed sensor and signal means, an electrical reference signal generator that produces a reference signal, a comparator which receives the reference and engine speed signals and produces an error signal which is utilised for controlling an actuator that operates the clutch to vary the state of engagement of the clutch to alter the engine speed with subsequent variation of the engine speed signal to approach equivalence with the reference signal so as to equalise said signals thus maintaining a substantially constant engine speed until the clutch is fully engaged. Preferably, means are provided to adjust the reference signal depending upon the torque demand upon the engine of the vehicle so that as the vehicle torque demand increases the reference signal is caused to correspond with a higher engine speed. The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of one embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a schematic drawing of the preferred embodiment of the invention Fig. 3 is a detailed circuit of the engine speed sensor in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a detailed circuit of the limiter and switching circuit as utilised in Fig. 2 shown in their relationships to the difference amplifier 13i and comparator 113. Fig. 5 is a detailed circuit of the phase gain shaping network in Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is a detailed circuit of the oscillator in Fig. 2 Fig. 7 is a detailed circuit of the mark space ratio modulator of Fig. 2 and Fig. 8 is an output as used in Fig. 2. With reference to Fig. 1 of the drawings a conventional motor car has the usual engine 11, clutch 13, gearbox 14, gearshift lever 15, throttle 16 and an inlet manifold 17. The engine speed is sensed by a transducer not shown which produces a signal S1 representative of engine speed and a sensor 21 receives this signal signal and produces a voltage1 proportional to the engine speed. The voltage signal V1 is fed to a comparator 23 which measures the difference between the voltage V and a voltage signal VR which is obtained from a reference signal generator 34, which is for example a potentiometer across the vehicle battery. The reference signal VR can be set to be the same value as a signal obtained via the sensor 21 at a particular engine speed for example 1000 r.p.m. An error signal E is derived from the comparator 23 and is fed into a clutch position control 22 which controls the operation of an actuator 27. The actuator 27 operates the vehicle clutch 13 and is powered by means which may be pneumatic, hydraulic or electrical. The clutch position control 22 comprises an actuator control 25, a clutch position transducer 42, and a comparator 45. The position transducer 42 is coupled to the actuator output and produces a voltage signal 43 representative of the position of the clutch. This signal 43 is fed into the comparator 45 for comparison with a command signal constituted by the error signal E. The difference signal 24 from the comparator 45 is fed into the actuator control. Taking a pneumatic actuator 27 by way of example, the actuator 27 may be connected to a vacuum source, for example, the inlet manifold 17 of an internal combustion engine 11, via solenoid valve 30, and non return valve 40, causing the actuator 27 to move to engage the clutch. Alternatively the actuator 27 may be connected to atmosphere through solenoid valve 29 causing the actuator to move to release the clutch under the influence of an internal spring located in the actuator. The actuator control 25 causes either valve 29 or 30, depending upon the polarity of the difference signal 24, to be switched on and off rapidly at a fixed rate. The open time of these valves 29 and 30 is dependent on the amplitude of the difference signal 24. The Open time for either valve 29 or 30 determines the velocity of the actuator 27 in the appropriate direction so that the actuator velocity is proportional to the difference signal 24. The actuator 27 operates so as to equalise the position signal 43 and the error signal E and reduce the difference signal 24 to zero. Consequently the actuator takes up a position dictated by the error signal E. The error signal E determines the degree of engagement of the clutch. The clutch position control 22 operates the actuator 27 so as to vary the state of engagement of the clutch 13 with the engine 11 and thereby alter the engine speed to cause the engine to speed signal V1i approach equivalence with the reference signal VR and make the error signal E approach zero. When the engine speed signal V1 is lower than the reference signal VR the clutch is disengaged. When V1 is equal to VR the clutch is part engaged and when V1 is greater than VR the clutch is fully engaged. The range of engine speed over which engagement takes place is determined by the overall system amplification. The degree of exactitude with which the error signal E approaches zero is determined by the gain in the system, i.e.the higher the gain the greater the exactitude.In addition, engagement of the clutch will load the engine, resulting in a reduction of speed and consequently more gradual clutch engagement. The operation of the clutch control apparatus is as follows From a standing start, the clutch position control 22 causes the clutch actuator 27 to disengage the clutch by venting the actuator to atmosphere through valve 29. If the driver places the gearshift lever into first, or possibly second gear then, as the driver operates the throttle control 33 to increase the engine speed, once the engine speed increases so that the voltage V1 approaches the reference voltageVR the actuator 27 will begin to engage the clutch 13. The error signal E activates the clutch position control 22 which in turn operates the actuator 27 so as to move the clutch 13 into engagement with the engine 11 to increase the torque load upon the engine through the friction clutch. This has the effect of reducing the engine speed and bringing V1 close to VR. The driver will recognise the fall in engine speed and further open the throttle, hence increasingV1 which in turn causes the clutch to further engage.This process of increasing the throttle opening and holding the engine speed steady by engagement of the clutch will continue until the clutch is fully engaged. The slow increase in the rate of engagement of the clutch ensures a smooth take up of the clutch, and hence a smooth starting by the vehicle. When the vehicle is moving and the clutch fully engaged the engine speed will rise as the driver increases the throttle opening. When the engine speed exceeds some threshold speed, for example, 2000 r.p.m., the position control 22 causes the disengagement speed to be reduced to a value lower than the original engagement speed so that engine speeds lower than the original engagement speeds are permissible when in higher gears. In order to make the control system responsive to varying torque demands from the engine, for example, start on a hill or towing a caravan it is necessary to make the reference signal vary accordingly, so that as the torque demand for a standing start increases i.e. so that the engine does not stall , then the reference signal becomes equivalent to a higher engine speed. One simple method of doing this is to utilise a variable potentiometer 34 fitted to the vehicle throttle control 33 as the reference generator, so that as the throttle opening increases the reference signal also increases and becomes equivalent to a higher engine speed. The connection between the throttle control 33 and the reference signal potentiometer 34 is shown by dotted lines in the drawing. The reference signal to throttle opening curve is not necessarily linear, and is shaped to give a maximum value at 50 of throttle opening. In Fig. 2 is illustrated a preferred control system that causes the reference signal to vary. Further the system operates so that once the clutch has engaged and the vehicle starts to move off then should the engine speed fall, say for example, because the vehicle is going up an incline, then the clutch will not be caused to disengage to equalise the ref r i cc and engine si ed signals but will. ret engaged below the reference until a predetermined minimum engine speed is reached. The comparator 113 is equivalent to the comparator 23 in Fig. 1 and receives an engine speed signal V1 and an input signal and measures the difference between the two signals V1 and V5 to produce an error signal E. The error signal E is positive when V1 is less than V5 and becomes negative when V1 exceeds Vs. The crror signal E from the comparator 113 is fed into a clutch position control which operates in a manner as previously described for Fig. 1. The vehicle engine speed is sensed by a sensor 111 that produces a voltage V1 proportional to engine speed. The electrical circuit of the sensor is illustrated in detail in Fig. 3 but is basically a magnetic probe sensing the teeth on the engine flywheel and a transistor pump circuit. The input signal Vs is derived from a difference amplifier 131 which adds together signals representing throttle opening and a fixed reference, VT and VR respectively. The throttle position is sensed by a transducer 127 which is a variable potentiometer that produces a signal VT proportional to the throttle opening. The signal VT can be a positive signal which has a value proportional to throttle opening i.e. small value at light throttle and large value at full throttle. Alternatively, as utilised in the preferred embodiment, the signal VT can be proportional to throttle closure i.e. at light throttle opening the signal is at a maximum and at full throttle opening the signal has a minimum value. This relationship can be written as signal VT k l throttle opening . The inverse relationship between the signal VT and the throttle opening is utilised because the signal VT is required in this form to control other functions in the vehicle gearbox. The throttle position transducer 127 is connected to a limiter 128 the action of which is to allow the throttle signal VT to vary only over a limited range say 10 to 50 of the throttle opening. The limiter 28 is disclosed in detail in Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings. The signal VT is fed into an inverting input of a difference amplifier 131. The difference amplifier 131 also receives a reference signal voltage VR from a reference signal generator 114. As in Fig. 1 the reference signal generator 114 is a potentiometer across the vehicle battery. Because the throttle transducer 127 is connected in the reverse sense, producing maximum voltage for closed throttle conditions, the difference amplifier 131 acts as a summing junction to add the signalsVT and VR together and produce a resultant input signal Vs which is fed into the comparator 113. The throttle transducer signal VT is utilised to modify the speed of the engine at which the error signal E changes from positive to negative. At a moment of high torque demand e.g. on a hill start when VT is at a high value because the throttle is part open , since V5 VT VR then V1 must correspond to a high value of engine speed e.g.1500 r.p.m. before the error signal is changed from positive to negative and therefore, the engine speed must be increased before the clutch is operated. A switching circuit 123 is connected between the error signal E and the throttle signal VT. When the negative value of error signal exceeds a predetermined amount the switching circuit is actuated. The switching circuit is shown in detail in Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings. The switching circuit 123 changes the throttle signal VT at a value corresponding to a light throttle opening. When in the unenergised state the switching circuit has no loading effect on the signal VT. Once the switching circuit has operated and the reference clamped to the light throttle value, the error signal increases, and consequently ensures that the reference remains clamped until the engine speed is reduced to that corresponding to the light throttle take up value. The effect of this is that on vehicle take off on a hill when the clutch engages V1 VR VT at say 1500 r.p.m. as the engine speed increases and theE becomes negative, then if for some subsequent reason the engine speed drops the clutch will not disengage until the engine speed falls below 1000 r.p.m. A choke position indicator 129 produces a signal Vc, preferably but not necessarily proportional to the degree of choke. The signal Vc is combined with the reference signal VR prior to the reference signal being combined with the throttle position signal VT. Hence if a degree of choke is required for starting the vehicle then the input signal Vs is increased by the signal Vc and the engagement speed for the clutch is increased to accommodate the higher idling speed of the engine. The clutch position control comprises a comparator 130 equivalent to comparator 45 in Fig. 1, that receives the error signal E and a signal from a travel transducer 132 responsive to the clutch position control. The signal from the comparator 130 is then fed into a phase gain shaping network 133, introduced to ensure the system stability, a mark space ratio modulator and oscillator, 134 and 135 respectively, and then utilised via an output 138 to control a solenoid operated hydraulic valve 136. The hydraulic valve 136 controls the hydraulic pressure in a hydraulic actuator 137. The markispace ratio of the signal fed into the solenoid valve 136 determines the hydraulic pressure in the actuator and hence the state of engagement of the clutch. The shaping network 133 oscillator 135, mark space ratio network 134 and.output are shown in detail in Figs. 6 to 8 respectively. For the ease of understanding Figs. 3 to 8, the electrical terminals on each component are numbered according to component to which they are connected, e.g. in Fig. 3 the terminal 113 connects the engine speed sensor 111 to the comparator 113.
