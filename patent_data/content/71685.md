# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDLING NUCLEAR FUEL ELEMENTS

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for transferring nuclear fuel elements between a fluid filled storage pool 11 and a cask 5 is disclosed. The cask 5 is supported within and is restrained by a tank 2 which is transported between terminal locations 6, 13 of a nuclear facility. Transfer of fuel elements between the storage pool 11 and the cask 5 is accomplished by coupling the tank 2 to a port 7 of the pool 11 . The transporter 1 accurately positions and restrains the tank 2 during transfer, in a preferred embodiment, the cask tank 2 is unweighted from the trans porter 1 during transfer and is advanced into a fluid sealed engagement with a port surface of the pool 11 . In an alternative arrangement, the cask tank 202 remains sup ported on the transporter 201 during its transfer and lifting means mutually engaging the transporter 201 and tank 202 advance the tank 202 toward the port surface for establishing a coupling between the port and the cask 205 . The method and apparatus substantially reduce fluid con tact with an exterior surface of the cask 5 or 205 during transfer and potential nuclear contamination they enhance the protection of the transfer apparatus against seismic disturbances and, they accomodate casks of different sizes.
