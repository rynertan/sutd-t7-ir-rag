# FUNGICIDAL COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a water based fungicidal com position containing at least three components which are a a metal ammonium complex of a C₁ C₁₀ carboxylic acid in which the metal is copper or zinc, b a salt of a tertiary alkyl primary amine with a C₁ C₄ monocarboxylic acid, and c a quaternary ammonium salt of a tertiary amine. The com position may be used i for protection of crops such as vines, coffee, tea, tobacco, peanuts, potatoes, apples, pears, cereals and hops against fungal diseases, ii as paint biocides, iii as wood preservatives, iv for sterilisation of masonry or fungus infected interior walls, v in damp proof and fire retardant compositions, vi to prevent mildew on fabrics and vii to counteract growth of algae and marine fouling.
