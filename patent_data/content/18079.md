## Description
DIGITAL TYPE ULTRASONIC HOLOGRAPHIC APPARATUS The present invention relates to an ultrasonic holographic apparatus for detecting the sizes, shapes and positions of foreign matters present in an object by means of a digital type ultrasonic hologram, and more specifically to an ultrasonic holographic apparatus which is useful for detecting the presence of cracks in such objects as the piping installation of a nuclear reactor. Examples foi probing cracks in the metals are mentioned below. According to the conventional ultrasonic holographic apparatus, transmitted ultrasonic pulses of sinusoidal waveforms are radiated from a probe onto an object that may contain cracks, reflected waves hereinafter referred to as object modified waves reflected by the cracks present in the object being examined are received, the thus received waves are permitted to interfere with respect to a reference wave having a predetermined phase difference relative to the transmitted waves, and the amplification of the resulting interferance waves is luminance modified to prepare an ultrasonic hologram of the cracks.With the above conventional apparatus, electric signals of sinusoidal waves are used as reception waves and reference waves, and the phase difference between the transmitted wave and the reference wave is controlled py an analog electric circuit. Furthermore, the amplitude of the interference waves is obtained by the multiplication of the transmitted signals and the reference wave signals. Ultrasonic holographic apparatus which employs such analog signals has the following defects. 1 The reflected signals must have a width of from several microseconds to several tens of micro seconds so that they are interfered by the reference signals. 2 A large oscillator and a large power amplifier are required in order to transmit pulses of sinusoidal wave form from the probe. 3 Limitation is imposed on the distance of inter ference fringes of the hologram which is obtained depending upon the ultrasonic frequency being employed. In order to eliminate the above mentioned defects, a digital type ultrasonic holographic flaw detector has been proposed in our British Patent Application No. 27,559 78 published under Serial No. 2,000,291. According to the digital type ultrasonic holographic flaw detector disclosed in British Specification No.2,000,291, clock pulses are produced after an interval of a predetermined period, ultrasonic pulses are generated in synchronism with pulses which are produced by dividing the frequency of the clock pulses, coincidence in time between the reflected signals in the ultrasonic pulses received during a predetermined gate period and the clock pulses is examined, and coincidence pulses are produced when they are in agreement in order to prepare a hologram by the coincidence pulses, so that the state of cracks can be detected from the positions and shapes of the thus prepared hologram of a fringed pattern. It is an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasonic holographic apparatus which is free from the defects referred to above, and which is more simply constructed than the known apparatus. According to the present invention there is provided an ultrasonic holographic apparatus for detecting the sizes, shapes and positions of foreign matters present in an object 5 by means of a digital type ultrasonic hologram, said apparatus having a probe 1 a scanner 11 for moving the probe in relation to the object a scan controller 10 for controlling the movement of the scanner spike pulse generation means 14,1 for initiating the transmission of ultrasonic trigger pulses from said probe amplifier means 17 for receiving the reflected ultrasonic signals from the object a clock pulse generator 12 for generating clock pulses maintaining a predetermined time interval signal detection means 13 for detecting coincidence between reflected signals and clock pulses and a display means 19 characterized in that means X8 are provided for generating a gating signal delayed in relation to an ultrasonic trigger pulse and in that means 463 are provided within the signal detection means for counting the clock pulses from an instant when the ultrasonic pulses are transmitted from the probe to the instant when a selected reflected signal is received within said predetermined gating signal, in order to produce the counted value in a divide by n manner, wherein nis a positive integer, wherein the output from the counting means is displayed on the display means. Thus instead of using time coincidence detection means as disclosed in British Specification No. 2,000,291, a binary counter is preferably provided to count the reference signals from a predetermined instant until object modified signals are received.

Fig. 15 is a block circuit diagram of a second embodiment of an ultrasonic holographic apparatus and Fig. 16 is a block circuit diagram showing an example of the sectional coordinates arithmetic unit 20 of Fig. 5. The principle of the present invention is discussed below in comparison with the principle of the conventional analog type ultrasonic holographic apparatus. Figs. 1 to 4 are diagrams illustrating the principles of a conventional apparatus and the apparatus of the present invention when the waves reflected by the cracks in the object being examined are observed using a probe having a resonance frequency of 1 MHz. Fig. 1 shows the case when the surface of the object being examined is in parallel with the scanning lines of the probe. In this case, the distance between the probe 1 and the surface of an object 5 being examined is twice that of an ultrasonic wave length 7 which travels in a medium 7.The probe 1 scans along a scanning line 2. When the probe 1 is located at an origin X 0 and at a position X x1 on the scanning line 2, an ultrasonic beam 3 emitted from the probe 1 is reflected by points Ag and A1 of a crack 6 and enters into the probe 1. In this case, let it be assumed that distances of waves which propagate through the object 5 being reflected by the points Ag and A1 are 4 times and 6 times that of the ultrasonic wave length A5 in the object 5 being examined.A reference wave 4 enters into the probe 1 at an angle of 0 When the flaw as shown in Fig. 1 is to be detected by the conventional holographic apparatus, the reflected wave and the reference wave are in phase at the points Ao andA1, whereby the amplitudes of interference waves become maximum at the scanning positions X 0 and X x1, making it possible to display interference fringes. In other words if the scanning position X is represented by the abscissa and the amplitude S of interference waves is represented by the ordinate, signals of a waveform as shown in Fig. 2 are obtained.The scanning is effected by the probe 1 fromX O to X x1 while displaying the interference fringes when the amplitude S of the interference waves if of a positive value, and an ultrasonic hologram of the crack 6 consisting of three interference fringes is displayed. In this case, the interference fringe is exhibited for each change of the propagation distance of ultrasonic waves by a quantity equal to the ultrasonic wave length 5, the ultrasonic waves being transmitted from the probe 1, reflected by the surface of the crack 6 and returning again to the probe 1.Therefore, the interference fringes of the ultrasonic hologram of the crack 6 correspond to contour lines the distance between the contour lines is one half of the ultrasonic wave length X5 in the direction of depth of the ob3ect 5 being examined. From the number of interference fringes, therefore, it is found that the depth of crack 6 from the point Ag to the point A1 is X5. When the flaw is to be examined in the manner shown in Fig. 3, the distance between the surface of the object 5 being examined and the probe 1 is 2X7 at the scanning position X 0 and 1.5A7 at the scanning position X X1. Further, the surface of the object 5 being examined is tilted with respect to the scanning line 2. In this case, the relation between the amplitude S of the interference waves and the scanning position X is as shown in Fig. 4.The ordinate and abscissa of Fig. 4 have the same meaning as the ordinate and abscissa of Fig. 2. As will be obvious from Fig. 4, when the surface of the obJect 5 being examined is tilted relative to the scanning line 2, the interference fringes in the ultrasonic hologram of the crack 6 do not represent contour lines in the direction of depth of the object 5 being examined. Therefore, it becomes difficult to find the distribution of the depth of cracks by simply relying upon the number of interference fringes. The principle on which the present invention is based is as follows. When the flaws or crack are to be detected as shown in Fig. 1, the number of clock pulses is counted from the instant the ultr,asonic pulses are transmitted to the instant the reflected waves are received. In this case, at the scanning position X 0, the propagation time of ultrasonic waves if 2X7 V7 4X5 V5 second, and at the scanning position X xl, the propagation time is 2 7 V7 6X5 V5 second. Symbols v7 and V5 denote propagation speeds of ultrasonic waves in the medium 7 and in the object 5.If the clock pulses of a period T are counted according to the binary notation, the counted values at the scanning positionsX 0 and X x1 will be 4X7 V7 4X5 V5 T and 4X7 V7 6 4 V5 T, respectively. In order for the bit 1 which is a second bit as counted from the minimum bit in the above counted values to assume values 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 while the scanning position changes from X O to X x1, the period of the clock pulses should be selected to beT A5 2v5.Likewise, if clock pulses of a periodT 5 v5 8 are used, the value of bit 3 which is a fourth bit as counted from the smallest bit in the counted values of clock pulses, changes in a manner of 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 while the scamping position changes from X O to X x1. By utilizing the values 0, 1 of bits of clock pulses which are counted according to the binary notation, it is possible to prepare an ultrasonic hologram of the crack 6. When the cracks are to be detected under the conditions as shown in Fig. 3, the clock pulses of a periodT X5 2v5 are counted from the instant when the wave reflected by the surface of the object 5 to be examined is received to the instant when the waves reflected by the crack 6 are received. The binary counted values at the scanning positions X 0 and X x1 are 4ss5 v5 T and 6X5 v5 T, respectively.The values of bit 1 which is the second bit as counted from the minimum bit in the binary counted values changes in a manner of 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 as the scanning position changes from X O to X x1. If the interference fringes are displayed when the value is 1, an ultrasonic hologram consisting of three interference fringes can be prepared. The ultrasonic hologram is substantially the same as the hologram obtained under the flaw detacting conditions of Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 5, the ultrasonic holographic apparatus is applied to a pulse echo system in which the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves are performed by a probe 1. The probe 1 effects the scanning along a scanning path 2 on a plane X Y being driven by a scanner 11. A scan controller 10 produces X drive pulsesXD and Y drive pulses YD to control the scanner 11, and further sends and X coordinate signal XC and a Y coordinate signal YC to a display 19 to indicate the position of the probe 1. Further, the scan controller 10 feeds a reset signal C Fig. 9 to a hologram signal detector 13 and to a trigger pulse generator 14. A clock pulse generator 12 produces clock pulses B Fig. 7 of N Hz which are supplied to the hologram signal detector 13. The trigger pulse generator 14 generates trigger pulses F Fig. 9 of a narrow width maintaining a predetermined interval of time, which are fed to a spike pulse generator 15, to a waveform shaping circuit 18 and to the signal detector 13. The spike pulse generator 15 generates spike pulses in synchronism with the trigger pulses F from the trigger pulse generator 14. An isolator 16 feeds high voltage spike pulses S from the generator 15 to the probe 1, and also feeds reflected wave signals F Fig. 11 to an amplifier 17, the reflected wave signals G being reflected by the front surface and back surface of the object 5 that is to be examined and reflected by the cracks 6, and further being received by the probe 1. The amplifier 17 amplifies the reflected wave signalsG from the probe 1 and feeds them to the waveform shaping circuit 18. The waveform shaping circuit 18 detects the signals amplified by the amplifier 17 and converts the signals having voltages which are greater than a predetermined level into pulses in digital notation. The waveform shaping circuit 18 further extracts only those digital pulses that are produced within a predetermined period of time after the trigger pulses have been produced, and further extracts as n th digital pulse K Fig. 11 only, and feeds them to the hologram signal detector 13 together with the gate pulses J Fig. 11 . The hologram signal detector 13 counts the number of clock pulses produced by the clock pulse generator from an instant when the trigger pulse F from the trigger pulse generator 14 is received, i.e., from an instant when the ultrasonic wave pulse is transmitted to an instant when a pulse from the waveform shaping circuit 18 is received, and feeds the value of an i th i is a positive integer bit which serves as a hologram signal to the display 19. In the case where no pulse is received within a period in which a gate pulse is being produced i.e., when no wave is reflected by the crack 6, the i th bit has a value O . The display 19 uses the X and Y coordinate signals fed from the scan controller 10 as deflection signals and hologram signals from the hologram signal detector 13 as luminance signals, thereby to display a hologram of the crack 6. Although the display employed is a generally used display of cathode ray tube, it may also be a display of liquid crystals. The circuits and their operation of some of the clocks shown in Fig. 5 will now be described in greater detail.The remaining blocks are similar to those used in conventional analog type ultrasonic holographic apparatus. Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram of the clock pulse generator 12, which comprises a quartz oscillator 101 which oscillates at 32 MHz, a comparator 102, an inverter 404, a zener diode 103 rated at 12 volts, and resistors 110, 111, 112, and 113,Fig. 7 is a waveform of signals A and B of Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 7, the clock pulse generator 12 produces clock pulses B of 31.25 iz. The sinusoidal signals A of Fig. 7 are produced by the quartz oscillator 101, and have a frequency of 31.25 MHz.Clock pulses B are converted from the signals A in a digital tanner, and acquire a TTL level 1 only when the signals A have exceeded a level indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 7 . The trigger pulse generator 14 or Fig. 5 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 8. The generator comprises two monostable multi vibrators 412, an AND gate 432, a resistor 114, capacitors 130 and 131, and A variable resistor 120. Referring to Fig. 9, the signal C represents a reset pulse from the scan controller 10 Fig. 5 . The trigger pulse generator 14.initiates the operation after the reset pulse C has been received. Signals D and E are produced by the monostable multi vibrators 412 of the first and second stages, and signals F serve as trigger pulses.A repetative period tw of trigger pulses is determined by the time constant of the circuit comprising the variable resistor 120 and the capacitor 130. The pulse width Atw is determined by the time constant of the circuit comprising the resistor 114 and the capacitor 131. The waveform shaping circuit 18 of Fig. 5 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 10. The circuit comprises resistors 114 to 119, 150 and 153, zener diodes 106 and 107, an operation amplifier 105, a buffer amplifier 104, a comparator 102, monostable multivibrators 412, a 4 bit up down counter 416, a NAND gate 400, an inverter 404 and an AND gate 408, capacitors 161, 162 and 163, variable resistors 151, 152 and 154 and a switch 170. Referring to Fig. 11, signals F are trigger pulses produced by the trigger pulse generator 14 Fig. 5 . The waveform shaping circuit 18 produces gate pulses of a width tg, which lag behind the trigger pulses F by td.The delay time td and the pulse width tg are determined by the time constant of the circuit comprising the variable resistor 151 and the capacitor 161 and by the time constant of the circuit comprising the variable resistor 152 and the capacitor 162. Signs 18 G are the reflected signals. The signals G are rectified and converted into signals H by the waveform shaping circuit 18.Then, the signals H which exceed a level indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 11 are digitally converted into pulses to prepare signals I. The level indicated by the dotted line can be set by the variable resistor 154 of Fig. 10.Digital pulses are extracted from the signals I within the periods in which the gate pulse signals J are being produced. Further, due to the presence of the switch 170 shown in Fig. 10, pulses which are received in the second place only are produced as received pulses K. The hologram signal detector 13 of Fig. 5 is shown in greater detail in Figs. 12 and 13. The detector comprises resistors 180 and 181, a capacitor 190, a NAND gate 400, a NOR gate 402, an inverter 404, an AND gate 408, an OR gate 432, a J K flip flop 473, hexa edge trigger flip flops 475, 4 bit binary counters 463, 3 bit data selectors 451, and switches 171, 172 and 173. Referring to Fig. 14, signals B are clock pulses produced by the clock pulse generator 12 Fig. 5 , signalsF are trigger pulses produced by the trigger pulse generator 14, and signals K and J are gate pulses and received signals produced by the.waveform shaping circuit 18. The counted value of clock pulses at JO is indicated at 1101, and the counted value of clock pulses at J1 is indicated as 1011 in the binary notation. With the switch 173 being set as shown in Fig. 13, the second bit from the smallest side in the counted value is produced as a hologram signal. Therefore, the hologram signal 0 is O at the received pulse JO and 1 at the received pulse J1. The level 1 is maintained until the gate pulse K breaks when there is no received pulse, or until the second bit from the smallest side in the counted value is O when there is a received pulse. When the switch 171 is opened in Fig. 12, a frequencydivided counted value of X drive pulses XD in counting the clock pulses B is stored in the counter when the operation for counting the clock pulses is initiated. Therefore, the instant when the ultrasonic wave pulse is transmitted and the instant when the operation for counting the clock pulses is started, deviate in proporation to the scanning positionX. This operation makes it possible to realize the flaw detection, which is substantially similar to the case when the reference waves are tilted using the conventional ultrasonic holographic flaw detector, i.e., which is substantially similar to the holographic flaw detection of the Leith type. Referring now to the second embodiment as applied to the flaw detector, which is shown in Fig. 15, an alternative circuit section to the waveform shaping circuit 18 of. Fig. 10, as surrounded by a dotted line, is provided. In this case, a received pulse produced with the switch 170 being set to a small value, is fed as a trigger pulse KT to the hologram signal detector 13A. The hologram detector 13 is constructed in the same manner as the circuit shown in Fig. 12. In this case, however, the above mentioned trigger pulse KT is employed instead of the trigger pulse F produced by the trigger pulse generator 14 Fig. 5 . A sectional coordinates arithmetic unit 20 calculates sectional coordinates of the object 5 in accordance with the number of clock pulses counted by the hologram signal detector 13A and X coordinate signals XC from the scan controller 10, to produce a signal which indicates the position of the reflecting body such as crack 6, front and back surfaces of the object 5 . A display 21 displays a cross sectional image of the object 5 relying upon the signals from the sectional coordinates arithmetic unit 20, which work as X deflection signals and Y deflection signals, and relying upon the hologram signals from the hologram signal detector 13, which work as luminance signals. The display 21 which displays a cross sectional image is constructed substantially the same as the display 19. The sectional coordinates arithmetic unit 20 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 16. The circuit comprises a digital to analog converter 489, a buffer amplifier 104 and an operational amplifier 105, inverters 404, variable resistors 190, 191 and 192 and resistors 185, 186, 187, 188 and 189. Referring to. the circuit of Fig. 15, a signal T which represents the number of clock pulses from the hologram signal detector 13 is converted into an analog value At by the digital to analog converter to prepareX deflection and Y deflection signals for displaying the cross sectional image according to the following equations, and the thus prepared signals are fed to the display 21 which displays the cross sectional image. XA At 2v sin commat XAO 1 YA At 2v cos g 2 z In the above equations, symbol XAO represents a voltage of an X coordinote signal from the scan controller 10, v represents the speed of sound, and g represents an incident angle of the ultrasonic waves which fall on the object 5 being examined. The values of 1 2v sin e and 1 2v cos Q can be set by the variable resistors 191 and 192. The display 21 displays the cross sectional image of the object 5 being examined relying upon the voltages XA and YA which are obtained according to the above mentioned equations and which serve as coordinate deflection signals, and relying upon the hologram signals 0 from the hologram signal detector 13, wHich serve as luminance signals. The following advantageous effects arise from the first embodiment described above. a The interference gaps on the hologram can be controlled irrespective of the frequency of the ultrasonic waves being employed, so as to increase the resolving power, as required. For example, the switch 173 of Fig. 13 may be set to a small value in order to prepare a detailed hologram having. small interference gaps. The following advantageous effects additionally arise from the second embodiment described in Figs. 15 and 16. b An ultrasonic hologram of cracks can be prepared without being affected by the uneven surfaces of the object being examined. Referring to Fig. 12, for example, if reception pulses by the waves reflected by the surfaces of the object are used instead of trigger pulses, an accurate hologram of cracks can be displayed without being affected by uneven surfaces of the object that is to be examined. c Use of a counted value of clock pulses makes it possible to display the cross sectiopal image simultaneously with the display of the hologram.
