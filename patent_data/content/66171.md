# Fire retardant epoxy resins containing 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxides.

## Abstract
Epoxy resins are rendered fire retardant by the addition thereto of a 3 hydroxyalkylphosphine oxide. Other halogen containing flame retardants may or may not be present in the composition. Mixtures containing a brominated epoxide and or a halogenated phosphine oxide provide a high level of flame retardance at low levels of the additive. The epoxy resins may be heat cured in the presence of an acid anhydride or amine to form a polymer having the phosphine oxide incorporated in the polymer molecule.
