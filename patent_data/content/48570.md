# High strength insulation materials.

## Abstract
Novel perlite silicate type insulation materials are pro vided having improved physical strength qualities. More particularly, such materials are provided having high flexural or transverse strength as measured by A.S.T.M. standard C 203. According to a preferred embodiment, amounts of phosphate within a limited proportioned range are added to insulation mixtures to yield shaped insulating bodies having a flexural strength in excess of about 60 lb. inÂ². Addition of clay is made according to another preferred embodiment, whereby substantial reduction in shrinkage is accomplished.
