# Ethylene dimerization.

## Abstract
A novel ethylene dimerization catalyst is provided con sisting essentially of a nickel compound, a phosphine com pound, and an acidic compound. In addition, an improved ethylene dimerization process is provided which comprises contacting ethylene with the novel catalyst composition pres ent, in an effective solvent, at a temperature from about 0 C to about 200 C. As a result of the inventive process, high catalyst productivity and good selectivity to the desired dimerized product, 1 butene, is obtained.
