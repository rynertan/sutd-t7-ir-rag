## Description
PHOTOSENSITIVE COMPOSITION This invention relates to a photosensitive composition suitable for producing photosensitive lithographic printing plates. More particularly, the invention relates to a photosensitive composition containing an o quinonediazide compound as a photosensitive component. It is known that when an o quinonediazide compound is exposed to actinic radiation, the compound is decomposed to form a carboxylic acid of a 5 membered ring, whereby the compound is converted into an alkali soluble material. Therefore, a photosensitive composition containing such an o quinonediazide compound has been widely used for photosensitive lithographic printing plates, photoresists, etc., as a photosensitive composition obtaining posi posi type images. Such a diazo compound is generally used for photosensitive lithographic printing plates, etc., as the form of the sulfonic acid ester obtained by chemically condensing an o quinonediazide compound having a halogenosulfonyl group such as sulfonyl chloride, etc., and a mono or poly hydroxyphenyl compound. Examples of the hydroxyphenyl compound to be condensed with the o quinone diazide compound are 2,2 dihydroxydiphenyl, 2,2 ,4,4 tetrahydroxydiphenyl, 2,3 dihydroxynaphthalene, p t butylphenol, etc. In these diazo compounds relatively high molecular weight o quinonediazide compounds such as the o naphthoquinonediazidosulfonic acid esters of a phenolformaldehyde resin or an o cresol formaldehyde resin described in U.S. Patent No. 3,046,120 are excellent with respect to matters such as good film forming property, etc., and have been widely used. Also, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 1045 81 corresponding to U S. Patent 4,306,011 and 1044 181 corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,306,010 ,Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 28,403 68 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,635,709 and 24,361 s74, etc., disclose o quinonediazidosulfonic acid esters of the condensation products of polyhydric phenols and aldehydes or ketones.Such o quinonediazidosulfonic acid esters of the condensation products of polyhydric phenols and aldehydes or ketones have an advantage that they can be developed by a relatively weak alkaline developer as compared to the o quinonediazidosulfonic acid esters of a phenol formaldehyde resin or a cresol formaldehyde resin but have a disadvantage that when the photosensitive composition composed of such an ester is formed on an anodically oxidized aluminum support, a small amount of the photosensitive composition is liable remain on the non image areas as patches after development. Such patches provide an undesirable appearance and when the developed photosensitive lithographic printing plate having such patches is used as a lithographic printing plate, stains form on the prints. An object of this invention is, therefore, to provide a photosensitive composition which can be developed by a weak alkaline developer and which is not likely to remain partially on the non image areas after developing a photosensitive lithographic printing plate precursor having the photosensitive composition as the photosensitive layer. Another object of this invention is to provide a photosensitive composition having a good film fo ming property. Still another object of this invention is to provide a photosensitive composition which can give clean prints without having stains when the photosensitive composition is used for a lithographie printing plate. As the result of various investigations for attaining the foregoing objects of this invention, the inventors have discovered that these objects can be attained by a photosensitive composition containing a condensation product of the sulfonyl halide e.g. , chloride, bromide etc., more preferably chloride of o quinonediazide and a high molecular compound having the structure shown by following general formula I or II EMI4.1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms and R2 and R3 each represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. It is astonishing that when the photosensitive composition of this invention is used for a photosensitive lithographic printing plate, the photosensitive composition scarecely remains on the non image areas after developing the lithographic printing plate precursor. Such results are quite different from using photosensitive compositions described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos.1045 81, l044 8l, etc. The reason for the difference has not yet been clarified but it is believed that the high molecular compound of this invention shown in general formula I or II contains a catechol derivative or a hydroquinone derivative respectively, while those disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 1045 81, 1044 81, etc., contain resorcin derivatives. Japanese Patent Publication No. 24,36l 74 discloses a photosensitive composition containing the condensation product of the sulfonyl halide of o quinonediazide and a resin prepared from a dihydric phenol having a hydrocarbon group and a monohydric phenol. However, since the condensation product has a long chain 10 to 20 carbon atoms hydrocarbon group and contains a monohydric phenol in the molecule, the photosensitive composition is reluctant to dissolve in a weak alkaline developer and is fundamentally different from the photosensitive composition of this invention. In general formulae I and II, R1 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms as described above but is preferably an ethyl group, a n propyl group, a n butyl group, a t butyl group, or a n hexyl group. Also, R2 and R3 each is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and in a preferred embodiment,R2 is a hydrogen atom and R3 is a methyl group or an ethyl group Furthermore, the molecular weight of the high molecular compounds shown by general formulae I and II effectively used in this invention is about 500 to 10,000, preferably about 800 to 4,000. The high molecular compounds shown by general formulae I and II used in this invention are prepared as follows. That is, each of the desired high molecular compounds can be obtained by condensing a polyhydric phenol as a catechol when preparing the compound shown by general formula I such as catechol, 4 ethylcatechol, 4t butylcatechol, etc., or a hydroquinone when preparing the compound shown by general formula II such as hydroquinone, 2 n propylhydroquinone, etc., with an aldehyde or a ketone such as formaldehyde, acetoaldehyde, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc., which are solely or in the state of the solution thereof in a solvent such as an alcohol, dioxane, etc., in an amount of 0.85 to 1.0 mol per mol of the polyhydric phenol using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid, etc., or an alkali such as sodium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia, etc., as a catalyst.In this case any desired combination of a polyhydric phenol and an aldehyde or a ketone may be used and further, two or more kinds of the polyhydric phenols or the aldehydes or ketones may be used. Examples of the sulfonyl chloride compound of o quinonediazide used in this invention are 1,2 benzoquinone 2 diazido 4 sulfonyl chloride, l,2 naphthoquinone 2 diazido 4 sulfonyl chloride, 1,2 naphthoquinone 2diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride, etc. of the above sulfonyl chloride compounds, more preferable examples are 1,2naphthoquinone 2 diazido 4 sulfonyl chloride and 1,2naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride and most preferable example is 1,2 naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5sulfonyl chloride. The condensation product of the sulfonyl chloride of o quinonediazide and the high molecular compound shown by general formula I or II is prepared as follows. That is, the sulfonyl chloride of o quinonediazide and the high molecular compound are dissolved in a solvent such as dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, etc., and an alkali such as sodium carbonate, etc., is added to the solution with stirring at room temperature or at a temperature of 40 to 500C to easily cause the esterification. The reaction ratio of the sulfonyl chloride to the high molecular compound shown by general formula I or II employed in the aforesaid esterification is 1 0.1 to 1 3, preferably 1 0.3 to 1 1. Typical synthesis examples of the condensation products of the sulfonyl chloride of o quinonediazide and the high molecular compounds shown by general formula I orII are shown hereinafter.

It is preferred to use the o quinonediazide compound in this invention only in the photosensitive composition of this invention as a photosensitive component but the o quinonediazide compound may be used together with a known o naphthoquinonediazide compound. As the o naphthoquinonediazide compound, the ester of 1,2 naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride and a pyrogallol acetone resin is most preferred. Examples of other suitable known o naphthoquinonediazide compounds are the esters of l,2 naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride and phenol formaldehyde resins described in U.S Patent Nos. 3,046,120 and 3,188,210. Other known onaphthoquinonediazide compounds used in this invention are described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos.5303 72 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,644,118 63,802 73 63,803 73 96,575 73 corresponding toCanadian Patent 1,008,593 38,701 74 and 13,354 73 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,711,285 JapanesePatent Publication Nos. 11,222 66 9610 l70 and 17,481 74 U.S. Patent Nos. 2,797,213 3,454,400 3,544,323 3,573,917 3,674,495 and 3,785,825 BritishPatent Nos. 1,227,602 1,251,345 1,267,005 1,329,888 and 1,330,932 and German Patent No. 854,890. The total amount of the o quinonediazide compound of the present invention and the prior art contained in the photosensitive composition is 5 to 0 by weight, preferably 20 to 402 by weight. The amount of the o quinonediazide compound of the present invention contained in the total o quinonediazide compound is 20 to 100 by weight. The photosensitive composition of this invention may further contain a known alkali soluble high molecular compound such as a phenol formaldehyde resin, a cresol formaldehyde resin, a phenol modified xylene resin, po lyhydroxystyrene, halogenated polyhydroxystyrene, etc.The proportion of such an alkali soluble high molecular compound is less than 70 by weight of the total amount of the photosensitive composition. The photosensitive compositions of this invention may further contain a cyclic acid anhydride for increasing the sensitivity, a printing out agent for obtaining a visible image directly after exposure, a dye as an image coloring agent, and other fillers.

As the printing out agent for obtaining a visible image directly after light exposure, there is a combination of a photosensitive compound capable of releasing an acid by light exposure and an organic dye capable of forming a salt.Practical examples are the combination of o n,aphthoquinonediazido 4 sulfonic acid halogenide and Åa salt forming organic dye described inJapanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 36,209 75 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,969,118 and 8128 78 and a combination of a trihalomethyl compound and a salt forming organic dye described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 36,223 78 corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,160,671 and 74,728 79 corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,212,970 . As the coloring agent, other dyes than the foregoing salt forming organic dyes can be also used. As the preferred dyes including the salt forming organic dyes, there are illustrated oil soluble dyes and basic dyes.Practical examples of these dyes are Oil Yellow 101, OilYellow 130, Oil Pink 312, Oil Green BG, Oil Blue BOS,Oil Blue 603, Oil Black BY, Oil Black BS, Oil BlackT 505 the above dyes are trade names, made by OrientKagaku Kogyo K.X. , Crys L Violet CI 42555 , MethylViolet CI 42535 , Rhodamine B CI 45170B , MalachiteGreen CI 42000 , Methylene Blue CI 52015 , etc. The photosensitive composition of this invention is coated on a support as a solution in a solvent dissolving the foregoing components. Solvents used for this purpose include ethylene dichloride, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 2 methoxyethyl acetate, toluene and ethyl acetate. These solvents may be used solely or as a mixture of them. Also, the concentration as solid content of the foregoing components in the solution of the photosensitive composition of this invention is 2 to 50 by weight.The coating amount coverage of the coating liquid depends upon the use of the photosensitive 2 composition but generally is preferably 0.5 to 3.0 g m as solid content in the case of using the composition for, for example, a photosensitive lithographic printing plate.With the decrease of the coating amount of the photosensitive composition, the light sensitivity of the photosensitive lithographic printing plate is increased butthe mechanical property of the photosensitive layer is reduced. When producing a photosensitive lithographic printing plate using the photosensitive composition of this invention, the photosensitive composition is coated on a support such as an aluminum plate subjected to a hydrophilic treatment, e.g., an aluminum plate subjected to a silicate treatment, an anodically oxidized aluminum plate, a grained aluminum plate, a silicate electrodeposited aluminum plate, a zinc plate, a stainless steel plate, a chromed steel plate, a plastic film or paper subjected to a hydrophilic treatment, etc. As a suitable developer for the photosensitive composition of this invention, there is an aqueous solution of an inorganic alkalifying agent such as sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium tertiary phosphate, sodium secondary phosphate, ammonium tertiary phosphate, ammonium secondary phosphate, sodium metasilicate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, ammoni a aqueous ammonia , etc. The concentration of the alkalifying agent is generally 0.1 to 10 by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5 by weight. The alkaline aqueous solution may contain, if necessary, a surface active agent and an organic solvent such as an alcohol. The invention will now be explained in more detail by the following examples. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to these examples. In addition, all percentages in the following examples are, unless otherwise indicated, by weight. EXAMPLE 1 A 2S aluminum plate of 0.24 mm in thickness was immersed in an aqueous solution of 10 sodium tertiary phosphate maintained at 800C for 3 minutes to perform degreasing, after graining with a nylon brush, is etched in sodium aluminate for about 10 seconds, and is subjected to a desmut treatment with an aqueous solution of 3 sodium hydrogensulfate. The aluminum plate was anodically oxidized in 208 sulfuric acid at a current density of 2 amperes dm2 for 2 minutes to provide an aluminum plate 1 The aluminum plate 1 was coated with a photosensitive liquid A having the following composition and dried for 2 minutes at 100 C to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate A of this invention.

The coverage of the photosensitive liquid after drying was 2.5 g m2. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 An aluminum plate as above described was coated with a photosensitive liquid C using a condensation product of 1,2 naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride and a reaction product of 2 methylresorcin and acetaldehyde the compound described in Example 1 of Japanese PatentApplication OPI No. 1045 81 in place of the compound obtained in Synthesis Example 1 in the photosensitive liquid A by the same manner as when coating the photosensitive liquid A to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate C .The coverage of the photo 2 sensitive liquid after drying was 2.5 g m On the photosensitive layer of each of the photosensitive lithographic printing plates A , B , and C was closely placed a positive transparency having a line image and a dot image and the photosensitive layer was exposed to a carbon arc lamp of 30 amperes at a distance of 70 cm. Each of the exposed photosensitive lithographic printing plates A , B , and C was rubbed for development by a sponge impregnated with an aqueous solution of 1 sodium metasilicate 9 hydrate . In this case the photosensitive lithographic printing plate A of this invention was quickly developed to provide a clean lithographic printing plate leaving almost no photosensitive composition at the non image portions. On the other hand, the comparison photosensitive lithographic printing plate B could not be developed since the photosensitive composition at the exposed non image portions was not dissolved in the developer.Also, the comparison photosensitive lithographic printing plate C could be quickly developed but a part of the photosensitive composition remained on the non image portions as patches and the patches once formed could not be removed even by applying the development again. Each of the developed lithographic printing plates A and C was printed on an offset printing machine. Clean impressions having no stains were obtained in the case of the lithographic printing plate A by the invention but the impressions obtained using the comparison lithographic printing plate C were partially stained.

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 An aluminum plate as above described was coated with a photosensitive liquid F using a condensation product of a m cresol formaldehyde resin and 1,2naphthoquinone 2 diazido 5 sulfonyl chloride in place of the compound obtained in Synthesis Example 3 in the photosensitive liquid D in the same manner as when coating the photosensitive liquid A to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate F . The coating amount coverage of the photo 2 sensitive liquid after drying was 2.0 g m in the photo sensitive lithographic printing plates D , E , and F . On the photosensitive layer of each of the photosensitive lithographic printing plates D , E , and F was closely placed a positive transparency having a line image and a dot image and the photosensitive layer was exposed to a carbon arc lamp of 30 amperes at a distance of 70 go . Each of the exposed photosensitive lithographic printing plates D , E , and F was rubbed for development by a sponge impregnated with an aqueous solution of 1 sodium silicate 9 hydrate . In this case the photosensitive lithographic printing plate D of this invention was quickly developed to provide a clean printing plate leaving almost no photosensitive composition at the nonimage portions. The comparison photosensitive lithographic printing plate E could be quickly developed but a part of the photosensitive composition remained on the non image portions as patches and the patches could not be removed by applying the development again. Also, the comparison photosensitive lithographic printing plate F could not be developed since the photosensitive composition at the exposed non image portions was not dissolved in the developer and could scarecely be developed by increasing the concentration of sodium metasilicate in the developer to 3 . Each of the developed lithographic printing plates D and E was printed on an offset printing machine. Clean impressions having no stains were obtained when using the lithographic printing plate D of this invention but the impressions obtained using the comparison lithographic printing plate E were partially stained.
