# Adsorption separation cycle.

## Abstract
An efficient fixed bed vapor phase adsorption cycle for bulk separations wherein the heat front generated by the exothermic heat of adsorption is maintained in the bed either in or behind the mass transfer zone, and is subsequently used in the desorption regeneration step. The cycle is especially useful in drying mixtures of water and compounds which form azeotropes with water as well as the azeotropes themselves, such as 190 proof ethanol.
