The compounds of this invention may be prepared by dehydration of a compound of formula V EMI10.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined with respect to formula II above and Rx representshydrogen, or a carboxyl blocking group, and thereafter if necessary carrying out one or more of the following steps i removal of any carboxyl blocking group Rx ii converting the product to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester group. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group Co2RX in formulae IV and V include salts, ester, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. The salts may not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable salts include inorganic salts, for example metal salts such silver or mercuric salt, or alkali metal salts such as the lithium or sodium salt, tertiary amine salts, such as thos with tri lower alkylamines, N ethylpiperadine, dimethylpiperazine. A preferred salt is with triethylamine. Suitable ester forming carboxyl protecting groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions. Such groups for Rx include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, allyl, acetonyl, t butyl, t amyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, adamantyl, 2 benzyl oxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, tetrahydrofur 2 yl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, pentachlorophenyl, p toluene sulphonylethyl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, an oxime radical of formula N CHRo where RO is aryl or heterocyclic, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester radical such as defined above. The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Rx group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. When it is desired to produce a compound of formula IlY in the form of a free acid or salt by the process of this invention, a compound of formula V is generally employed wherein RX is a carboxyl blocking group. For the preparation of a compound of formula II in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, it is convenient to employ a compound of formula V wherein Rx represents the desired ester group. The dehydration process of this invention may be carried out by treating a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI R802C N N COzR9 VI wherein R8 and R9 are independently aryl, or C16 alkyl optionally substituted with aryl and a compound of formula VII EMI12.1 wherein a, b and c are independently 0 or 1, and R10, Rll and R12 are independently aryl or C1 6 alkyl optionally substituted with aryl. In the compounds of the formula VI R8 and R9 are preferably selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, and benzyl, the ethyl and t butyl groups being preferred. Thus a preferred compound of formula VI is diethyl azodicarboxylate. It is often convenient that R8 and R9 represent the same group. Preferred compounds of the formula VII include triarylphosphines and trialkylphosphites. Preferred groups R10, Rll and R12 include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, benzyl, phenyl and methoxyphenyl.Conveniently, R10, R11 and R12 represent the same group. A particularly preferred compound of the formula VII is triphenylphosphine. Generally, approximately two equivalents of the compounds of the formulae VI and VII are used per mole of compound V . The elimination reaction is generally carried out at non extreme temperature, such as 200C to 100oC. We have found it convenient to begin the reaction at a depressed temperature, such as 0 C, and then to allow the temperature to rise to about room temperature. The reaction is performed in an inert aprotic organic solvent. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, benzene, dichloromethane and the like. Alternatively, the dehydration process of this invention may be carried out by converting compound V into a compound of formula VIII EMI14.1 and eliminating the elements of a compound of formulaH X therefrom, wherein R1, R2, R3 and Rx are as defined with respect to formula V above, and X is a leaving group. Suitable groups for the leaving group X include halogen a group of formula O SO2 O n R13 or O CO O n R13 wherein n is zero or 1 and R13 is aryl or C16 alkyl optionally substituted with aryl and a group of formula OPO 0R14 2 wherein R14 is C16 alkyl or aryl. Preferred groups of formula OCO O nRl3 are those wherein n is zero and R13 is C16 alkyl, in particular acetoxy. The elimination of the elements of a compound of the formula H X is most conveniently brought about by treatment of a compound of the formula VIII with a base in an aprotic medium. Suitable bases include powdered inorganic bases such as alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates or hydroxides, for example powdered potassium carbonate, or alkali metal hydrides. Also suitable are organic bases of low nucleophilicity, for example, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene. Suitable solvents for use in this reaction include dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and the like. The elimination may be effected at a low temperature such as 70 to 700C, for example 40 toOoC. The compounds of formula VIII may be prepared from the compounds of formula V by replacing the hydroxy group by a group X. Alternatively the group X can be introduced into the molecule at an earlier stage in the synthesis of the penem nucleus. In particular the groups OSO2 O nR13 and OCO O nR13 can be introduced at the beginning of, or at any stage during, the synthesis of the penem. In each case, the group X is introduced by replacing a hydroxyl group.One particular intermediate useful for the synthesis of compound of formula VIII is the compound of formula IX EMI15.1 wherein Rl and R2 are as defined with respect to formula II above, R15 represents C1 6 alkyl, aryl or aryl C1 6 alkyl, and R16 represents hydrogen or anN protecting group, and X is as hereinbefore defined. Suitably R15 is triphenyl methyl. Suitable mild oxidising agents include perbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide or sodium metaperiodate. Suitable perbenzoic acids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid are most preferred. The compounds of formula II where R3 representsSRa may also be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a sulphoxide of formula X EMI16.1 wherein R1, R2 and Rx are as defined above and R18 represents an organic radical different to the groupRa with a thiol of formula XI or a reactive derivative thereof Ra SH XI and thereafter carrying out one or more of the following steps i removal of any carboxyl blocking group RX ii converting the product to pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester group.Suitable organic radicals for R18 include those described above for R3. The process may be carried out in any inert solvent such as acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide DMF , tetrahydrofuran THF , dioxane, hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA or glyme. The solventDMF is preferred. A low temperature is preferred, suitably below 0 C, preferably below 200C especially from about 300C to about 700C. Alternatively we have found it useful to use a phase transfer catalyst. Particularly suitable phase transfer catalysts include tetra n butyl ammonium bromide, cetyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and cetyltriethyl ammonium chloride. Suitable solvents include halogenated water immiscible solvents such as chloroform or dichloromethane in the presence of water. When using a phase transfer catalyst, it is preferable to conduct the reaction between OOC and ambient temperature. When the thiol compound of formula XI itself is employed, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base, although this is not essential.Examples of suitable bases include sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, sodium amide, potassium amide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide, soduim methoxide, potassium butoxide, triethylamine, tripropylamine and diisopropylethylamine.Advantageously, the base is used in an amount of at least 0.9 equivalent, preferably 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents, per mole of the thiol compound. Instead of using the base in the reaction, a reactive derivative of the thiol compound of formula XI may be used. Preferably the reactive derivative is a salt of the thiol XI , in particular a salt with an alkali metal, preferably sodium or potassium. The amount of the thiol compound of formula XI or its reactive derivative is not critical. Generally, however, it is used in an amount of at least 1.0 mole, preferably from 1 to 3, per mole of the compound of formula X . Compounds of formula X may be prepared byS oxidation of a compound of formula XII EMI18.1 wherein R1, R2, R18 and Rx are as defined with respect to formula X above with a mild oxidising agent. Suitable mild oxidising agents include perbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide or sodium metaperiodate.
