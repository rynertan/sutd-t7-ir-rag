# Local area networks.

## Abstract
A Local Area Network LAN is disclosed which enables a generalized data communication facility to be established over ordinary telephone wiring. The disclosed technique provides a completely general LAN architecture with any excess protocol and is well suited to CSMA CD carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection . The invention consists of architec tural and circuit techniques which enable the construction of a local area network s LAN over ordinary wiring within a build ing or beween buildings within a short distance of each other often called a campus . The LAN is implemented without dis turbing the normal voice function of the telephone circuits and without the need to string additional wiring. Implementing a LAN in accordance with this invention requires only three types of hardware functional elements in the appropriate quantities for the application a a Node Unit NU , b Repeater Unit RU , and c depending on the size of the network, possibly a Pulse Regenerator Unit PRU .
