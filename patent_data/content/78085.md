## Description
Travelling trolley The invention relates to a travelling trolley mainly comprising one or more track wheels, a load carrier and a connecting body between wheel and carrier. The invention has for its object to improve a travelling trolley of the kind set forth in a sense such that it can be manufactured from very few component parts in an efficient manner at low cost and that, moreover, it is adjustable so that the travelling trolley can be readily adapted to different guide rails, that is to say, to the different kinds of profiles such as INP or UNP. The travelling trolley according to the invention is distinguished in that the connecting body is made from sheet material which is profiled by a pressing process into the desired shape. Thanks to this profiling comparatively thin sheet material may be used, which is nevertheless suitable for transferring heavy forces, whilst at the same time the connecting body is pressed into the desired shape so that the lines of force caused by the load pass most advantageously to the wheels. Moreover, the connecting body can be at once shaped in a form such that the wheels are protected and guided in the optimum manner. In order to reduce the bending moment in the axle stubs of the wheels it is preferred to provide the connecting body with a cup shaped bulging part, to which the axle stub can be secured. Thanks to this cup shaped bulging part not only field or force is passed through a larger part into the web of the connecting body, but also the rigidity of the connecting body is enhanced. It necessary, one or more bulging parts opposite to the cup shaped bulging part may be provided in the sheet shaped connecting body Preferably the bulging part have an elongate shape, the main dimension of the bulging parts lying at a lower level than the axle stubs, being directly substantially vertically, whilst the main dimension of the bulging parts lying above the stubs is substantially horizontal. In a preferred embodiment having at least two opposite track wheels with the associated, sheet shaped connecting bodies the load carrier has a U shaped design, the web thereof exending between and substantially parallel to the connecting bodies and the flanges of the carrier being connected with the sheet shaped connecting bodies. This design has the advantage that the web of the load carrier extends below the guide rail, which ensures a uniform load distribution among the connecting sheets. Such a disposition provides, moreover, the possibility of providing elongate holes in the flanges for passing bolts connected with the sheet shaped body. In this way the travelling trolley can be adapted to different widths of the track profiled used. According to a further embodiment the travelling trolley is distinguished in that the load carrier is provided with at least one shaft extending parallel to the wheel axles, along which shaft each connecting body can be slid and fixed in position. Owing to the use of a shaft, which can be simply manufactured, a cheap, adjustable travelling trolley can be obtained, whilst in addition an optimum position of the shaft with respect to the track wheels can be easily maintained in order to ensure an optimum transfer of forces so that the connecting bodies are loaded at a minimum In order to obtain a minimum overall weight the or each shaft is slidably arranged in a sleeve secured to a profiled, sheet shaped connecting body. The sheet shaped, profiled body can withstand comparatively high bending forces, whilst the sleeve ensures an effective parallel guide for the two opposite connecting bodies. In order to achieve easy fixation each sleeve has a chamber accomodating an element that can be clamped around the shaft. This clamping element is preferably designed in the form of a clamping spring and the shaft may have circumferential grooves for creating predetermined locations of the connecting bodies with respect to the shaft. The aforesaid and further advantages will be described more fully with reference to four embodiments shown in the Figures. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a perspective view of a first embodiment of the travelling trolley in accordance with the invention, Fig. 2 a perspective view like fig. 1 pf a second embodiment, Fig. 3 a sectional view taken on the line 111 111 in fig. 2, Fig. 4 a detail of the lower part of a travelling trolley in a third embodiment, Fig. 5 a fourth embddiment provided with a single track wheel. Fig. 6 a perspective view of a fifth embodiment of a travelling trolley, Fig. 7 is a sectional view of the shaft of the load carrier in the travelling trolley shown in fig. 6, Fig. 8 a sectional view taken on the lineVIII VIII in fig. 7, Fig. 9 a perspective view of a sixth embodiment. The travelling trolleys shown mainly comprise track wheels 2 adapted ro run along a profile 1, a load carrier 3 and a body 4 interconnecting said track wheels 2 and the load carrier 3. According to the invention the connecting body 4 is made from relatively thin sheet material, which is bulging at 5 in the direction of the profile 1, whilst in addition opposite bulging parts 6, 7 may be provided see fig. 1 . To the bulging parts 5 are fastened the axle stubs 8 of the track wheels 2 so that the axle stub may be shorter, as a result of which the bending moment in the axle stub see fig. 5 can be appreciably reduced. Moreover, owing to the cup shaped bulging part 5 the load transferred in the plate 4 passes through a larger region in said plate, which region corresponds to the transitional rim between the bulging part and the sheet material. The bulging parts 6, 7 of fig 1 or 6 in fig.2 have mainly an elongate shape, it being noted that the main dimension of the bulging part 6 lying in a region below the axle stubs 8 is substantially vertical, whereas that of the bulging part 7 above the bulging parts 5 is horizontal. In this way the plate shaped connecting body 4 is stiffened to an extent such that on the top side the pressure load can be effectively absorbed by the bulging part 7, whereas the tensile and bending loads are withstood by the bulging parts 6. The load carrier shown in fig. 1 has substantially the shape of a H, the web 9 of which extends between and substantially parallel to the two plate shaped connecting bodies 4 on both sides of the guide profile 1. The flanges 10 of the H shaped load carrier are secured by means of bolts 11 to the bent over flanges 21 of the plate shaped bodies 4. By providing sufficient lenghts of the flanges 10 and by providing, in addition, elongate holes 12 wherein the distance between the plate shaped connecting bodies 4 can be adapted in the desired manner to the width of the track flange 13 of the profile 1. By means of comparatively few component parts a strong and universally usable travelling trolley is thus obtained. It should be noted that a buffer 14 can be arranged in the bent over flanges 12 of the plate shaped connecting body 4. In order to improve the passage of forces between the connecting body 4 and the flange 10 of the H shaped carrier the flange 12 is bulging at 15, the bulging part fitting in a depressed channel 16 of the flange 10. The end rims 20 of the flanges 21 ensure true tracking so that the wheel cannot creep up. By the broad part 22 the flange 21 constitute an efficaceous support in wheel rupture. Fig. 2 shows an embodiment in which the connecting body has no counter bulging parts. By a correct proportioning a see Fig. 3 on both sides of the neutral lineI I the material of the connecting body is the same. Thereto inter alia an incision 18 is made in the bent over flange 21, whilst the rim 20 ensures tracking. The rims of the connecting body are bent over so that, for example, the bulging part 7 in fig. 1 can be dispensed with. The lower rim of flange 17 has a width increasing towards the middle. The connection with the H shaped load carrier is established with the aid of one bolt 11, one elongate hole 12 and two inwardly directed depressions 15 with the appropriate channels 16. Fig. 4 shows am embodiment in which the load carrier is formed by a bridge portion 3 which is directly arranged between the plate shaped connecting bodies and fastened by means of bolts 18. The plate shaped connecting body 4 is suitably formed and profiled by means of the bulging parts 6. Fig. 5 shows am embodiment of a travelling trolley having only one track wheel 2 adapted to roll in aU shaped profile 1. The axle stub 8 of the track wheel 2 is fastened, like in fig. 1, to a bulging part 5, whilst the connecting body 4 is also provided with an opposite bulging part 6, 7. In this case the load carrier 3 is part of the same sheet from which the connecting body 4 is made, the sheet being deformed in a manner swch that the eye of the load carrier is located substantially beneath the vertical line going through the track wheel 2. In this way a particularly simple, single travelling trolley is obtained. The travelling trolley shown in fig. 6 comprises track wheels 31, four of which are arranged pairwise side by side. Each track wheel is rotatable about an axle stub 32, which is non rotatably secured in one side 33 in a plate shaped connecting body 34. The plate shaped connecting body 34 is suitably profiled in order to withstand the bending and tractive forces involved. For example, a depressed part 35 is provided in the connecting body 34 leading to a sleeve 36, which is secured to the connecting body in a sense opposite the axle stub 32. The sleeve 35 accomodates a shaft 37, which forms part of a load carrier 38. The load carrier is formed by a plate 39 extending parallel to the connecting bodies 34 having at the ends a continuous hole for receiving the shaft with close fit. The bore of the sleeve 36 is such that a slidable fit is obtained for the shaft 37 so that an accurate parallel guide is ensured when the connecting body 34 and hence the sleeves 36 slide along the shafts 37 of fig. 6. For fixing the sleeves 36 in position with respect to the shaft 37 a resilient clamping body 40 is arranged in a chamber 41 of the sleeve. The resilient body 40 can be released from the shaft 37 by means of the ends 33 protuding out of the sleeve and being moved towards one another so that the spring 40 can be displaced along the shaft. The depth of the chamber 41 decreases towards the middle of the travelling trolley so that the sleeve automatically clamps tight to the resilient body 40 in the right hand direction in fig. 7 indicated by the arrow P1 Upon a reverse movement the spring 40 gets into the wider part of the chamber 41 so that it can be released in the manner described above, as a result of which the whole assembly is displaceable along the shaft 37. The shaft preferably has shallow grooves 42 receiving the clamping body 40 so that a given distance between the connecting bodies 34 can be set in a simple manner, said distance corresponding, for example, to the standard size of the profiles along which the travelling trolley is movable. Fig. 9 shows an embodiment in which each of the connecting bodies 34 is provided with two stubs 32 for the wheels ans a single sleeve 36 for the shaft 37. Two bulging parts 35 converge to the sleeve 36 and join eachother there. The adjustment of the sleeve 36 over the shaft corresponds with the above described manner. As a matter of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. The plate shaped connecting body 34 may have any desired form owing to the simple pressing process by which the sheet can be stiffened by bulging parts and can be shaped into the desired form by setting to be fastened to the carrier or the axle stubs of the track wheels respectively. Moreover, any other guard means than a spring 40 may be used for the adjustment of the sleeve with respect to the shaft.
