# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYVALENT VIRUS VACCINES IN A SINGLE CELL SYSTEM, SUCH POLYVALENT VACCINES AND THEIR APPLICATION

## Abstract
A polyvalent virus vaccine comprising a rabies virus and a canine distemper virus, and substantially free from tissue material, is prepared by propagating the viruses in a single cell system. Preferably the rabies strain no. 675, deposited with the Czechoslovak National Collection of Type Cultures of the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Prague under CNCTC no. A 04 77, is used for this purpose. The preparation process is preferably carried out by first infecting a suitable single cell system with a rabies virus strain, propagating the rabies virus and then infecting the cell system with at least a canine distemper virus, propa gating the viruses and preparing from the propagation product the polyvalent vaccine. The so abtained polyvalent virus vaccine may be used for a method for immunisation of warm blooded animals comprising inocculation of the animal with such vaccine.
