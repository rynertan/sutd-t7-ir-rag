# Natural occurring thermoplastic resins as a substitute for various petroleum derived compounds in rubber stocks.

## Abstract
Natural occurring thermoplastic resins are used as a substitute for process oils and or hydrocarbon resins, as well as for tackifiers, softeners, extenders, processing aids, and cure retarders, in rubber stocks, as for example, a rubber skim stock used in making a tire. The resins, which are derived from crude wood rosin, are high melting thermo plastic resins having carboxylic acid groups and are insolu ble in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The source of the natural occurring resins is in ample supply as they are obtained from pine trees grown in North America.
