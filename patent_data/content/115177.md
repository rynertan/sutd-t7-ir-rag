## Description
REACTION SINTERED MULTIPHASE CERAMIC BODY AND USE THEREOF IN ELECTROLYTIC CELL IN ALUMINUM PRODUCTION The invention relates to ceramic bodies which have one or more of nitride phases of Al and or Si plus one or more of phases of boride, carbide, silicide and or sulfide of Groups 3b, 4b, 5b and 6b elements. A combination of the latter compounds can be either two discrete phases e.g. a boride and a carbide or a single complex phase e.g. a borocarbide . This invention also relates to cells and components thereof employed in the electrolytic production of aluminum from a fused bath, both by electrowinning and electrorefining processes, and to the aluminum production processes employing such cells and components. Most commonly heretofore, these ceramic bodies have been of the type physically formed of ingredients corresponding to the crystalline phases in the ceramic bodies. By way of exemplary illustration, reference is made to the following prior art documents. U.S. Patent 3,108,887 discloses hot pressed particulate mixtures ofAlN with other compounds, among which are mentioned the compounds MX where M is different from X and is selected from aluminum, boron, silicon, rare earth metals, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, thorium, vanadium, columbium niobium , tantalum, protactinium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and uranium although no example is given of any of these Mx compounds . U.K.PatentSpecification 954,272 discloses bodies, either sintered or hot pressed, of particulate mixtures of A1N with a boride of titanium, zirconium, chromium or molybdenum.U.S. Patents 3,251,700 and 3,328,280 disclose hot pressed or sintered particulate mixtures of TiB2 andA1N. Generally those hot pressed or sintered physical mixtures require heating to relatively high temperatures of 1800 20000C or so. Moreover, such ceramic bodies have properties which are dependent upon and limited by the inherent effects of the physical nature of their ingredients which are physically combined. The distribution and sizing of the phases are generally directly related to the particle sizing and mixing of ingredient powders. The powders are not always easily available in uniformly fine sizes for obtaining homogeneous distribution of phases and superior properties. Milling of powders to improve their sizing can lead to undesirable situations. In fact, some powders such as TiB2 in sizes of about 5 um or finer present fire and explosion hazard during milling due to their rapid reaction with oxygen in air under conditions of frictional heating. Amongst numerous reactions for forming other types of multiphase bodies by an unusual reaction hot pressing process involving passage of electric current through the reaction mixture during the process, U.S.Patent 3,143,413 discloses reaction hot pressed ceramics with phases of ZrN and either ThS, VaC or ZrC, but no details are given about the properties of such bodies made from 60 mesh reactant powders heated up to 1800 23000C. There has been a continuing need for multiphase ceramics with easily controlled and predictable composition, crystal structure including uniform phase distribution and fine grain size and related physical properties, and which can be easily and economically fabricated in a variety of shapes by heating at lower temperatures. Most aluminum is made by the Hall Heroult process comprising electrolysis of alumina in a molten cryolite bath using carbon anodes and cathodes. The aluminum settles under the cryolite bath on the carbon cathode.However, the aluminum does not wet the carbon cathode and electromagnetic forces in the cell produce waves in and the humping of the molten aluminum. To ensure that the carbon cathode floor of the cell is always completely covered with aluminum, a relatively thick cathode layer, pad or pool of aluminum is maintained, which continues to be subject to waving and humping movement. The latter factor necessitates substantial anode cathode spacing or gap to avoid shorting between the anode and the moving aluminum cathode pool. It is that spacing or gap that causes considerable electrical energy loss in the resistance heating of the cryolite aluminum cell bath therein. Various cell designs of drained cathodes and of cathode pool packing, baffles or weirs have been proposed to alleviate the aluminum movement and energy problem. Also, various aluminum wettable materials and bodies have been proposed without much success for economically accommodating cell designs that can alleviate those problems. There remains the basic need for cathodes and cathode pool structures of aluminum wettable, durable bodies which can be readily and economically fabricated.Summary of the Invention This invention substantially overcomes the aforesaid limitations of the prior art and enables the practical attainment of greater technical and economic ease and flexibility by providing ceramic bodies of Al and or Si nitride and certain boride, carbide, silicide and or sulfide phases with specially tailored and improved properties as noted herein, and by providing certain components of an electrolytic aluminum production cell, which in use are normally in contact with molten aluminum or in electrical contact with other components which are normally in contact with molten aluminum, with surface and or inner portions of the components made of reaction sintered multiphase ceramic as defined herein, which is wettable by and durable in molten aluminum and cryolite as well as being electrically conductive.The invention involves not only the new components, but also the cells for and methods of producing aluminum by electrolysis, including both electrowinning and electrorefining aluminum. . The invention is characterized by the discovery of a novel reaction sintered ceramic body and the method of forming it, which body is characterized by uniformly fine grained and intimately interdispersed phases of certain nitride and other nonoxide compound easily obtained from reactants generally having substantially larger particle sizing than the grain size of the phases in the ceramic body, viz. usually one order of magnitude larger. The reaction hot pressed body of this invention is noted for virtual absence of open porosity, toughness and hardness for wear resistance, corrosion erosion resistance to molten aluminum and cryolite with the other nonoxide phase of Groups 4b to 6b metals , low electrical resistivity, thermal shock and oxidation resistance.It is also notable that these valuable properties can be attained by heating and mixture of reactants to temperature not greater than 16500C and without need for any grain growth inhibitor or sintering aid. The xÃanvention is a reaction sintered multiphase ceramic body or cell component consisting essentially of a fine grained, homogeneous, intimate interdispersion of a 5 95 preferably 45 95 mole percent of nitride phase or phases having a maximum grain size substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 10 um and being nitride of one or both ofAl and Si, and b 5 95 preferably 5 55 mole percent of second phase or phases having a maximum grain size substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 10 um and being boride, carbide, silicide, sulfide or combination thereof of one or more of the elements of Groups 3b including lanthanide and actinide series elements, 4b, 5b and 6b which body contains 0 to 4 weight percent oxygen and is prepared by the process comprising c admixing particulate reactants of maximum particle size substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 150 um and being elements, compounds, intermetalloa compounds, alloys sor combination thereof in stoichiometric proportions to substantially form the nitride and second phases, and d shaping and heating the admixture to form the reactive sintered body, the heating being done in nonreactive atmosphere and at temperature at which the reaction and sintering occurs between the reactants to substantially form the nitride and second phases. Reaction sintering involves the dual effects of reaction between and sintering together of the admixed reactants at temperature causing the reaction to occur and be substantially completed. It may be effected at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressure. The latter condition involves the substantially simultaneous shaping and heating steps of hot pressing to produce a body of the invention with very little or no open porosity and highest strength properties, although some preliminary separate pressing or heating of the reactant admixture may be advantageously done. there open porosity is desired in an otherwise tough and hard body of the invention, the separate heating step at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressure may be employed sequentially following the shaping step. Of course, reaction temperature is governed by the particular reactants and their identified reaction temperature at whatever pressure is selected for performing the heating step. The body of the invention may contain, as part of the nitride and or second phases, diluent which is a nonreacted portion of the reactant admixture as a stoichiometric excess amount of a reactant and or as a nitride or second phase according to the aforesaid invention definition but different than the reactants. Brief Description of the Drawing The sole figure is a schematic, vertical cross sectional view of an aluminum electrowinning cell incorporating components comprising the composite body in accordance with the invention.Detailed Description Part of the invention will be illustrated by reference to one exemplary type of production cell and process, but it is capable of being adapted to other types of electrolytic aluminum production cells and processes, including electrorefining, The sole figure schematically shows a cell comprising a carbon liner and cathode base 1 in a heat insulating shell 2 and with a cathode current collector or bar 3 embedded in the liner 1. Within the liner 1 is a shallow or thin cathodic layer or film 4 of molten aluminum and an alumina containing molten cryolite electrolyte 5 at a temperature of 940 10000C.This electrolyte commonly consists of sodium cryolite Na3AlF6 as the major component plus about 4 10 wt. calcium fluoride, about 2 10 wt. aluminum fluoride and about 2 8 wt. alumina. However, as desired, the electrolyte may be of other alumina containing compositions. The aluminum layer 4 and molten electrolyte 5 are surrounded by a crust or frozen layer or freeze 6 of the solidified electrolyte. Anodes consisting of prebaked blocks of carbon 7, which are suspended by anode current feeders 8, dip into the molten electrolyte 5 above the shallow aluminum layer or film 4, with a spacing d being maintained between the bottom of blocks 7 and the top of the thin layer or gilm 4. Commonly commercial cells have several rows of pairs of anodes 7. Blocks 7 are generally of the same size in each cell.Such size can range from about 60x40x40 cm for small cells to about 150x100x70 cm for large cells. Operating anode current density is usually between 6 and 10 kA m2. The carbon cathode base 1 has its upper surface, which faces anode blocks 7, covered by a cathode layer 9 of slabs, segments or plates positioned either closely together or in spaced relation to allow the molten aluminum formed as film 4 on layer 9 to drain continuously off of the top of layer 9 into suitable reservoir or collection basin not shown . The segments of s layer 9 can be either fastened to the carbon base 1 e.g. by pegs of carbon or the material of layer 9 or merely placed thereon, with mating surfaces providing good electrical contact as needed.These segments of layer 9 or surface portion thereof are one of the components desirably formed of reaction sintered multiphase ceramic according to the invention.Such segments, plates or slabs of the reaction sintered ceramic can be about 0.5 5 cm thick e.g. approximately 2.5 cm. They can be of any suitable length, width and geometric shape. For convenience of manufacture and installation, the slabs can be made with length and width dimensions in the range of about 5 15 cm, e.g.about 10 cm., for square or hexagonal shapes. By using this layer 9 of the ceramic plates of the invention as an operative aluminum wettable surface in contact with the cathodically collected molten aluminum, layer 4 of such molten aluminum can be easily maintained thin enough to avoid significant waving or humping therein, e.g. as a thin film typically less than about 1 mm or as a shallow layer of desired constant thickness, e.g. up to about 1 cm, if appropriate weirs or restraining means not shown are used at edges of layer 9 which may also be formed of the ceramic according to this invention . In either case, no significant waving or humping occurs in the thin aluminum layer 4 and the distance d can be greatly and reliably minimized, e.g. to about 2 4 cm, to reduce electrical energy loss. Further electrical energy savings may be achieved when even further portions of cell lining 1 are also constructed of the ceramic components of the invention.Even the cathode current collector 3 or inner portion thereof may be formed of those ceramic components. If carbon anodes 7 are employed, their position with respect to the desired spacing d can be adjusted as the blocks 7 wear away, with computer controlled anode feed devices maintaining the gap d relatively constant. Alternatively, the carbon anode 7 can be replaced with oxygen evolving anodes that remain relatively dimensionally stable, in which case the cell may be operated at higher current densities up to 20 50 kA mÃª. Optionally these anodes 7 may have a protective and or reinforcing casing 10, e.g. of alumina, to reduce the rate of wear and loss of carbon blocks 7. In producing aluminum in the cell shown in the drawing, additional alumina is fed into the electrolyte 5 as it becomes depleted of alumina by its electrolytic reduction to aluminum which settles onto and drains off of layer 9 in conventional manner.Body or Component Preparation It is believed that reaction sintering relies on the reaction having a substantial negative heat of formation as the driving force for the reaction. The products or bodies formed must have lower free energy of formation than the reactants from which they were prepared. The elements of the groups of the PeriodicTable as recited in the description of the invention are selected for the invention body so as to conform to these principles. Reaction sintering is initiated by heating the shaped mixture. At the reaction initiation temperature, the reactants begin to react and liberate a substantial amount of heat. This exotherm causes a sharp temperatur rise in the reactant powder mixture.It is believedthat this rapid temperature rise permits rapid diffusion of the reactants within the mixture, which causes either hot pressing compaction or sintering shrinkage under atmospheric or subatmospheric pressure as well as further chemical reaction to occur quickly. The reaction initiating temperature is generally much lower than the temperature necessary to attain a dense body by conventional hot pressing or separate pressing and sintering of preformed phase ingredients where no reaction occurs. Several processing parameters may be adjusted to optimize the conduction of the reaction sintering and the properties of the resultant ceramic body. Some of these parameters are type, purity and surface area of the particulate reactants stoichiometry of the reactant mixture pretreatment of the reactants, rate of heating magnitude of applied pressure before and or during heating post heating treatments and geometry of the body or product. Reaction sintering of admixtures according to this invention produces artsclÃ¨s or bodies with the nitride and second phases having very small grain size, generally about one order of magnitude smaller than the particle size of the starting reactant powders. The reaction sintered ceramic bodies can be easily prepared with maximum grain sizes of the nitride and second phases being substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 5 um preferably not greater that 1 um or even with mean grain sizes of such phases being substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 6 um preferably 2 um .These very fine grain sizes can be attained by using reactants with maximum particle sizes substantially e.g. at least 95 volume percent not greater than 44 um or with mean particle sizes less than about 25 um. Grain growth is usually not experienced because the products or bodies can be made at significantly lower temperatures with shorter hold times at heating temperature than by conventional nonreactive manufacturing techniques. Achieving such small grain sizes is often difficult if not impractical to accomplish using conventional nonreactive techniques because either preformed phase powders are not readily available in such small particle size of less than 5 um for the reasons noted above or irregular grain growth occurs at the higher processing temperatures in the absence of effective grain growth inhibitor. Generally the particulate reactants are mixed in the stoichiometric proportions to form the desired product phases. For example, the following molar proportion formula describes exemplary reaction mixture and product phases AlB2 TiN TiB2 AlN However, nonstoichiometric proportions e.g. of TiN may be used in order to vary the properties of the product or to control the reaction process. Powdered diluent material may also be added to the reactant mixture. The diluent may be or contain one of the elements of the reactants or may be or contain one of the elements of the reactants or may be the same as one of the reaction produced phases in the products or may be other suitable material, any of which may be used to control the reaction sintering or properties of the resultant product.The amount of diluent or diluents must be less than that amount which would prevent the reaction sintaring from taking place. The reactants can be mixed or blended in any suitable manner known to those skilled in ceramic technology for yielding an intimate, homogeneous mixture of reactant particles, e.g. by ball milling in dry or wet condition. For very dense products, the hot pressing procedure, including hot isostatic pressing, is employed. The mixed reactants are charged into a mold.If desired, those reactants may be given pretreatments such as dehydration, degassing or burn out of binder, provided the pretreatment temperature is kept below the reaction initiation temperature. It is advantageous to precompact the reactant mixture at room temperature and at 50 100 hot pressing pressure to ensure a uniformly compacted product after hot pressing. This was routinely done in making samples of the invention. For common hot pressing with a mold comprising an annular die with upper and lower plungers, the mold for precompaction and even pretreatment is preferably the same one used in subsequent hot pressing. The mold can be of any material not adversely reactive with the reaction mixture and that can withstand desired pressures up to 15,000 psi about 1055 kg cm or more.Graphite molds have been found very suitable for pressure up to 10,000 psi about 700 kg cm 2 and were exclusively used in making the samples of the invention. At least the precompactian pressure is usually applied to the charged mold and a suitable atmosphere is provided to completely contact the charged mold before heating is begun to effect reaction hot pressing. A moderate vacuum e.g. about 1 x 10 Torr was satisfactorily employed in making the samples of the invention however, inert gas atmosphere may alloyed for the same purpose of protecting the reactants and the mold from adverse air oxidation. As necessary, the pressure is increased to the full load during heating to or at the maximum hot pressing temperature. To assure good body density, full pressure should be at least 2000 psi about 140 kg cmÃª . Heating can be done in any suitable hot pressing furnace, such as an induction heating furnace or electric resistance heating furnace used to make samples of the invention, which provides very rapid heat up. Heating rates satisfactorily employed ranged between 9 and 25 C minute, the slower rates being used with reactant mixtures evolving hydrogen that is drawn off by the vacuum system. Heating progresses to a temperature at which the reaction sintering is initiated. That event is marked by a rapid temperature rise in the mold due to exothermic heat evolution from the reaction.When the maximum temperature and pressure for the reaction hot pressing are attained, they are usually held for at least some short period to assure complete reaction sintering, e.g. about 1 2 hours for products ranging between 1.5 4 inches about 3.8 7.6 cm in diameter and about 0.2 0.5 inch about 0.5 1.3 cm thick as in the cases of the samples made of the invention. Of course, larger plates of greater.thickness e.g. I inch or 2.5 cm may need to be held slightly longer in hot pressing, perhaps up to 5 6 hours. Thereafter, the molds containing the samples are cooled in the furnace under protective atmosphere at furnace cooling rate and the pressure is held on the samples until they were cooled to about room temperature. Then the molds are removed from the furnace and the samples are pressed out of the annular mold body. For bodies of lesser density, the reactant mixture can be fully compacted or shaped at room temperature generally at pressures up to 60,000 psi about 4.2 tons cm or more, but preferably between 10 50 x 10 psi about 0.7 3.5 tons cm , to yield a green i.e.unfired body, which is subsequently sintered at atmospheric pressure. Preforming of the green body can be done by a suitable ceramic fabrication process, e.g.dry or wet pressing, isostatic pressing, slip casting, extrusion, injection molding, doctor blading, etc. The multiphase ceramic bodies of this invention can be specially designed to have selected useful properties from a variety of choices depending upon their composition and processing. Generally they are very refractory and thermal shock resistant. They are also generally electroconductive. Many have low electrical resistivity and can function as electrodes or electrical conductors in a variety of applications.With resistance to chemical attack, such electrode and conductor applications can be in industrial electrochemical processes including electrolytic metal production electrowinning and electrorefining cells, batteries and fuel cells. Some bodies can have adequate electrical resistance to function as electrical resistance elements such as heating elements. Most of them are wear resistant and hard.They can also exhibit good strength and toughness.Consequently, those bodies can also useful serve as cutting tool tips, grinding media, high temperature bearings, engine components and other structural parts.In their more porous form, they may serve, for example, as filters tfor molten metal, as diaphragms or other components of electrolytic metal production cells, or as high surface area or catalytic devices. The above described reaction sintered ceramic body, preferably in hot pressed form, can be used for components of an electrolytic aluminum production electrowinning and electrorefining cell in contact with the liquid contents thereof when the second phase is or phases are boride, carbide, silicide and or sulfide of one or more of the elements selected fromGroups 4b, Sb and 6b. Especially desirable is the body of diboride of metal selected from Group 4b particularly titanium and aluminum nitride.Bodies A B The following two bodies are an exemplary comparison of a reaction hot pressed ceramic body and a conventionally nonreaction hot pressed ceramic body.Both had batch mixtures formulated to give 1 1 molar ratio of TiB2 and A1N phases in those bodies. Body A of the invention was formed according to the molar formula previously stated. The reactant mixture consisted of 44 wt. AlB2 of 9.2 um mps and 56 wt. TiN of 7.4 um mps. The AlB2 powder contained 1.9 wt. oxygen and 0.22 wt. carbon. The TiN powder contained 0.76 wt. oxygen and 0.19 wt. carbon. These reactants were dry mixed without binder in a revolving plastic jar with alumina balls. That mixture was hot pressed in a graphite mold and in a vacuum at a maximum reaction sintering temperature of 1600 C and 4000 psi 281.2 kg cm2 for 2 hours. This reaction is particularly interesting because TiN was thought to be thermodynamically more stable than TiB2.However, TiN and A1B2 do react to form TiB2 and A1N and that reaction is complete at 16000C. Body B not of the invention was formed from a batch mixture consisting of 62.9 wt. TiB2 of 3.2 um mps and 37.1 wt. A1N of 8.8 um mps. The TiB2 powder contained 0.36 wt. oxygen and 0.26 wt. carbon. TheA1N powder contained 2.22 wt. oxygen and 0.17 wt. Carbon. These nonreactive components were wet mixed with trichlorethane in a revolving plastic jar with alumina balls. The nonreactive mixture was hot pressed in the same manner as for Body A except that hot pressing was at 16500C and 5000 psi. The comparative properties of Bodies A and B are set forth in Table 1. The lower resistivity values ofBody A are believed related to a more uniform interdispersion distribution of small TiB2 grains therein in comparison with the microstructure of BodyB, the latter exhibiting larger and more nonuniform grain sizing. Samples of Body A were tested for suitability for use as a component, e.g. cathode or cathode current collector, in an electrolytic aluminum production cell. In a cathode pool test, a sample of Body A was merely placed submerged but not connected at the cathode in the molten aluminum cathode pool of a laboratory test cell operated at about 10000C for 10 hours with anode 2 and cathode current density of about 0.5 A cm . In a hanging cathode test, a sample of Body A was suspended and connected as the cathode extending into the representative molten cryolite aluminum batch of the laboratory test cell operated as noted above. The samples wer wetted by aluminum in both tests. The cathode pool test showed only very slight surface erosion and one small surface crack, but otherwise the sample had original sharp edges and surface. No visible corrosion erosion occurred in the hanging cathode test.

Both of these bodies were made in accordance with the following molar formula TiN Al 2B TiB2 AlN from a reaction mixture consisting of 56.02 wt. TiN powder, 24.45 wt. Al powder and 19.53 wt.

However, both of these bodies will be wet by molten aluminum and will be durable in molten aluminum and cryolite. Body C is particularly suitable for functioning as a cathode or cathode pool packing element. Samples of Body C were formed into two cutting tips of cutting tools with the standard diamond shaped profile and tested in a customary metal cutting test.The test involved a standard procedure of cutting a 2 inch 5.08 cm diameter bar or workpiece of Viscount 44 high nickel alloy steel for each test cycle with the experimental cutting tips bonded to a cutting tool base so as to have 0 rake angle and 40 clearance angle from the workpiece. Depth of cut was 0.032 inch 0.81 mm .The workpiece was rotated at 450 rpm to provide a cutting rate of 220 surface feet rinute 5.59 m min .The lateral feed rate axially along the workpiece was 0.005 inch revolution 0.127 mm revolution and the lateral length of the workpiece cut was 2 inches 5.08 cm . Cutting was done with and without spraying of customary cutting oil lubricant onto the cutting tip at the point of contact with the workpiece. The chips of metal removed from the workpiece during this test were classified as follows, with the best cutting performance being Class 1 and the poorest cutting performance being Class 3 Class l a single long continuous chip. Class 2 two or more moderately long continuous chips. Class 3 short segmented or discontinuous chips.The results of testing the cutting tip samples of BodyC in a first cycle of the above described test were as follows Sample 1 Sample 2 Lubrication No Yes Class of chips 2 1 Tip edge condition Slight crater No visible wear Metal build up on tip edge Slight NoneSample 1 satisfactorily performed cutting for 15 cycles before failure, at which time the edge of the tip broke and no longer cut the workpiece. Body E This body of the invention was made according to the molar formula TiAl BN B TiB AlN 2 by dry mix ing a reactant mixture consisting of 67.76 wt. TiAl powder of 33 um mps, 22.46 wt. BN powder of 10 um mps and 9.78 wt. B powder of 94 um mps. This mixture was hot pressed in the usual manner at 1600 C and 600 psi 421.8 kg cmÃª . The resultant body had the phases TiB2 M and AlN m , boride and nitride grain sizes of 1 um, 23.3 wt. Al, 41.1 wt.
