# Cold radiation detector assembly.

## Abstract
A cold detector assembly comprises a coldwell 10 having a detector 14 mounted at one end, and attached at the outer end to a housing 15, the housing being evacuated. The hous ing comprises an outer container, and has a detachable cap 20 with a window 24 through which radiation can reach the detec tor. A flexible connection means 36 couples the detector to a connector means 38, 40. The element 40 comprises 3 layers of insulation through which the electrical connections pass crook edly each connection comprises two aligned sections in the outer two layers and an offset section in the middle layer. This feeds a bias resistor board 42 and a connector extension de vice 44. A stress relief disc 46 is attached to the housing 16 by stand offs 76 and has recessed wells for the connector 40.
