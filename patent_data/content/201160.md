# MALLEABLE FORCE FULCRUM RETRACTOR

## Abstract
A Taylor type force fulcrum retractor 10 has a broad malleable band 12 which is readily shaped by hand to fit any situation and yet holds that shape against forces that may be applied to pull the muscles away from the centre of an incision. The force fulcrum retractor is particularly use ful in spinal surgery and may have a claw like spike or spikes 14 which penetrate the surface of a bone within the incision to establish an extraordinarily secure fulcrum.
