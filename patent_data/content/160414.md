# CONTAINERS AND METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING SAME

## Abstract
A combined sealed container eye bath device 20 speci fically comprises a sealed main container 22 for eye lotion and or cleaning liquid 24 and an eye bath 26 conjoined at 28 . The whole device 20 will be made and supplied as a sterile pack intended for disposable use, i.e. the contents 24 of the main container being adequate for a single application of fluid, normally to one eye but possibly to both eyes of the user. A thinned or otherwise weakened fracture formation 30 enables the eye bath 26 to be twisted or otherwise broken off the main container 22 to leave the latter upon at its top and the former readily handled by way of the part 28 then constituting a stem. Production of such a container is by adaptation of blow moulding techniques.
