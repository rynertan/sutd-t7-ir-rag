# Frequency discrimination circuit.

## Abstract
This frequency discrimination circuit includes a mono stable circuit 2 into which an input signal P is fed and a D flip flop 3 connected to the output side of the monostable circuit 2 for generating a frequency discriminated signal F . The circuit further includes a time constant modifying circuit 5 for modifying a time constant of the monostable circuit 2 according to the frequency discriminated signal F from the D flip flop 2 .
