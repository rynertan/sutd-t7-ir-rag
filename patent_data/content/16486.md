# Roof structure for a building.

## Abstract
A series of segments consisting of an elongated U section ceiling element, and two U section, elongated roof elements, form a combined sloping roof and ceiling unit. The roof elements are attached close to the ends of the upstanding flanges of the ceiling elements, and are of near enough the same breadth as these. When assembled the roof elements are clamped by the ridge beam. Pref. both elements are open upwards. Where the flanges of the U form roof sections contact those of an adjacent section, they are held by a clamping profile. Arrangement provides prefabricated roof ceiling elements which can be quickly assembled irrespective of the dimensions of the infra structure, so as to form a stable whole.

## Description
COMBINED ROOF CEILING The invention relates to a combined sloping roof ceiling, built up of pre fabricated elements.From the Netherlands patent application No. 7314092 there is known a roof ceiling system which is also built up of pre fabricated elements.The drawback of this system is that the dimensions of that ceiling and therefore also of the roof are entirely determined by the dimensions of the substructure, while, moreover, mounting of the ceiling, which is placed between the side walls of the dwelling, requires correct spacing of the side walls. Although the whole is built up of prefabricated elements, mounting is laborious owing to the large dimensions, takes much time, and, in addition, requires trained craftsmen. The purpose of the invention is to provide a roof ceiling combination built up of prefabricated roof ceiling segments placed side by side and coupled to each other, which can be mounted independently of the dimensions of the substructure in a very short time, and which form a very stable whole. The dimensions of the elements are less large, which makes transport and mounting easier and, moreover, permits of unlimited expansion of the dwelling in two directions. Mounting is very simple, moreover, and no additional roofing like tiles or slates etc. is needed. According to the invention, this is achieved due to the combined roof ceiling being built up of roof ceiling segments coupled to each other side by side, which segments consist of an oblong section, as ceiling element, of a substantially L or U shaped profile, and two oblong roof elements of practically the same width as the ceiling element, also of a substantially L or U shaped profile as roof elements, which near the two ends are attached to the flange or to both flanges of the ceiling element and which roof elements are rigidly coupled to each other at the ridge when mounted. By the term oblong is meant that, for instance, the ratio of the length to the width is 4 1 to 8 1.By the flange of the L shaped element is understood the short leg of the L shape. Preferably, flange or flanges of the ceiling elements are turned upward.Covering of the flanges of the roof elements, which are placed against each other, is preferably done by means of a cover profile, placed over the edges to prevent penetration of rain water.For the same purpose, the adjacent edges of the roof elements of several elements, when mounted, are preferably covered at the ridge by a ridge profile. In the system according to the invention, the overhang of the roof elements, and thereby also the roof pitch, can be easily varied. The oeiling and roof elements may have been made of a variety of materials, such as steel, aluminium, plastic, or glassfibrereinforced plastic and in particular fibre reinforced cement, in which preferably has also been taken up a resin dispersion of a polymer which contains acid radicals and has an average particle size between 0,05 and 5 microns, the setting mass having a water cement ratio between 0.2 and 0.5, while the resin cement weight ratio, is between 0.02 and 0.4. The width of the roof and ceiling elements may vary between wide limits, e.g. from 15 to 240 cm, the height of the upright edges being 5 to 60 cm. Preferably, the width is 30 120 cm and the height of the flanges 10 40 cm.Preferably, the bodies of the roof elements have a step shaped profile, for reasons of strength as well as aesthetics.At the ridge side, the roof elements may advantageously be provided with a raised edge, which is in particular higher than the upright flange or flanges.The length of the ceiling elements may vary from 2 to 12 m, in particular from 3 8 m. In attaching the roof elements to the ends of the ceiling elements, it is possible to leave a clearance between the bodies of the two elements. Ventilation air can flow in through this clearance, leaving the roof again at the ridge. To that effect, the ridge profile is mounted with a clearance over the slightly spaced end edges of the roof elements. In this way, continuous ventilation between roof and ceiling is obtained. The combined roof ceiling according to the invention is mounted very simply, is very stable and is independent of the substructure. Positioning of the interior walls of the substructure is completely free as regards the positioning of the outer walls, there is a high degree of freedom.The ceiling is rigid and can be walked on, so that the room above the ceiling can be made fit to live in. The roof ceiling is cheap and, moreover, wood substituting. This is of particular importance for countries where wood as a construction material is scarce. With reference to a drawing, the invention will be further elucidated. In this drawing Fig. 1 is a U shaped ceiling element in perspective Fig. 2 is a U shaped roof element, the body having a step shaped profile Fig. 3 is a combined roof ceiling segment Fig. 4 shows two adjacent, coupled roof ceiling segments. Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of a U shaped ceiling element of fibre reinforced cement to which has been added a resin dispersion consisting of a dispersion of a polymer which contains acid radicals and has an average particle size between 0.05 and 5 microns, the water setting mass having a water cement ratio between 0.2 and 0.5, while the resin cement weight ratio is between 0.02 and 0.4. The processability of the mortars used is excellent, in spite of the lower water cement factor and the presence of the acid radicals. In particular, preference is given to polymer resins prepared from monomers containing vinyl radicals. The polymer resins should contain acid radicals such as phosphoric acid or sulphoric acid radicals.These carboxylic radicals may come from built in mono unsaturated acids, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid or semi esters of maleic acid, fumaric acid or itaconic acid they may also have been grafted onto the polymer. Further, they may have been formed through modification, in particular through oxidation or saponification, of certain polymers. Preference, however, is given to carboxylic acids from monomers with one free valency, containing one or more carboxylic radicals and polymerized into the polymeric resin,For optimum results, these monomers are preferably present in a quantity of 2.5 to 30 0 by wt. relative to the polymer.Very good results are obtained if the quantity of unsaturated monomer containing carboxylic acids amounts to 5 to 25 by wt., in particular from 10 to 20 by wt. For the rest, the polymers consist of vinyl monomers, styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl chloride, cyclohexyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl versatate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl, butyl and hexylacrylate, dibutyl fumarate, or dibutyl maleate, methyl vinyl ether, ethylene and propylene. To reach optimum properties, it is desirable to choose the water cement. factor between 0.2 and 0.4. A ceiling element of a U shaped cross section consists of the body 1 and the flanges 2 and 3, the ends of which have been provided with holes 4, through which pivoting pins can be stuck.Fig. 2 represents Åa roof element of a U shaped cross section with a step shaped profile. In this figure, 5 indicates the body and 6 and 7 the flanges. At the ridge side of the roof, the element has a raised edge 8. Fig. 3 shows a combined roof ceiling segment. Ceiling elements of a U shaped cross section are attached to the substructure not shown .The roof segments 5, 6, 7 are pivoted to the ceiling elements by means of pins 10 which pass through the holes 4 and 12 of the ceiling elements and the roof elements, respectively. Subsequently, the roof segments are swung up till the upright edges 8 meet. These edges 8 are coupled to each other by means of pins 11. A ridge profile 9 is placed over the upright edges 8 to prevent penetration of rain water. By changing the position of the holes 12 in the roof elements, their overhang is changed and thereby the roof pitch. Fig. 4 shows two coupled roof ceiling segments, one behind the other.Over the abutting flanges 6, 7 of the roof elements of U shaped crosssection, a cover profile 13 has been placed for the same purpose as the ridge profile 9. As shown by the figures 3 and 4, there is a clearance 14 between the body 1 of the ceiling element and the body 5 of the roof element, when mounted. Through this clearance, air can flow in between roof and ceiling, which air leaves the roof again at the ridge. Continuous ventilation under the roof is thus provided.
