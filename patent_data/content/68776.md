# Radiation absorbing surfaces.

## Abstract
A substantially radiation absorbing layer of metal having a microstructured surface characterized by a plurality of ran domly positioned discrete protuberances of varying heights and shapes, which protuberances have a height of not less than 20 nanometers nor more than 1500 nm, and the bases of which contact the bases of substantially all adjacent protuber ances is disclosed. The metal layer, which may be a coating on a variety of substrates, and which may be overcoated with a thin film of a metal, is useful as a radiation absorber particular ly solar . A method is disclosed for producing such layers.
