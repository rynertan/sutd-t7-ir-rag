# BASE FOR A GRAFT POLYMER, NOVEL GRAFT POLYMER COMPOSITIONS, SOLVENT AND WATER REDUCIBLE COATINGS INCORPORATING THE NOVEL POLYMERS, AND PROCESSES FOR MAKING THEM

## Abstract
An aqueous dispersion is formed of a fluent resinous composition of a. a mixture in an organic solvent of i an ionizable graft polymer of an epoxy resin and an addition polymerized resin, the addition polymerized resin being bonded to aliphatic backbone carbon atoms of the epoxy resin by carbon to carbon bonds, and ii an extender resin b. an aqueous vehicle, and c. an ionizing agent the ionization present from said combined components being sufficient to establish the components as a dispersion in the aqueous vehicle, and a quantity of addition polymerizable monomer is polymerized in said aqueous dispersion, the aqueous dispersion serving as a vehicle for the polymeriza tion. A grafting base may be produced by advancing an aroma tic epoxy resin in the presence of at least one extender resin and a sufficient amount of an organic solvent to render the initial mixture and grafting base product fluent. The aqueous dispersion and the grafting base are formed into water reducible coating compositions.
