# An arrangement in liquid dispensers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a diaphragm pump for dispens ing or metering purposes, for example for use in liquid soap dispensers. The pressure chamber 7 of the pump is defined by a fixed wall 6 and the diaphragm 1 . A check valve on the inlet side towards a storage vessel 11 forms a cylindrical flange 4 movable in a groove 5 and sealing against the outer surface thereof. Arranged in a spout 2 passing through the diaphragm is an oblique wall 3 , which is slotted through a short distance around its periphery, thereby to form a seal against the suction of air into the pressure chamber 7 . The diaphragm 1 is arranged to be compressed by a pressure body 9 provided on a lever 8 .
