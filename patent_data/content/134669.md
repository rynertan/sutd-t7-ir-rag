# Photoelectric conversion device and its manufacturing method.

## Abstract
A plurality of first electrodes are sequentially arranged on a substrate and covered with a non single crystal semi conductor laminate member. On the semiconductor lamin ate member are formed second electrodes respectively corresponding to the first electrodes. Each first electrode and each second electrode and the region of the semiconductor laminate member sandwiched therebetween constitute one semiconductor photoelectric transducer. The transducer is connected to another transducer adjacent thereto so that the second electrode of the latter is connected to the first electrode of the former through a contact portion extending thereto from the second electrode of the latter into a contact groove cut in the semiconductor laminate member. In this case, the contact groove and the contact portion are not exposed in the side walls of the semiconductor laminate member. The side walls of the first and or second electrode are retained inside the side walls of the substrate. The first electrodes, the second electrodes and the contact grooves are defined by a laser beam.
