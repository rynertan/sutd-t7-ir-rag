# Method for separating the lanthanide marker form a lanthanide marked immunochemical component.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for separating the lanthanide marker from an immunochemical component marked with a lanthanide marker. The marked component has been bound to a solid phase via an immunochemical counterpart in an immunoreaction. According to the inven tion a solution of acidic pH is added to separate the marker.
