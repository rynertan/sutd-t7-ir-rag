## Description
PROGRAMMABLE TESTERThis invention relates to the field of test equipment, and more particularly to a programmable tester capable of testing automatically a variety of electronic units.With the introduction into the marketplace of sophisticated electronic equipment consisting of analog, digital and hybrid circuitry, there has developed a growing need for a portable tester capable of testing automatically this equipment. This need for a portable tester is further enhanced when one recognizes that much of the electronic equipment to be tested is itself portable, i.e., it is quite frequently moved and situated at different locations, or is part of an operating environment which is portable, such as an aircraft.A number of systems to measure the response of a unit under test UUT to preselected applied stimuli are known in the art. A primary purpose of the known systems has been to determine whether the unit under test is operating, or is operable, in accordance with predefined performance specifications. One of the significant disadvantages of the known systems of this type is that to a large extent they have been hard wired and specially configured to test only one or at most a few similar functional UUT s. Accordingly, it has been necessary to maintain a relatively large inventory of such expensive systems where large numbers of unrelated UUT s are to be tested. One approach which attempts to solve the problems inherent in some of the known systems is described inUnited States Patent No. 3,764,995. However, the disclosed system has several limitations and drawbacks associated therewith. in particular, its cust and size precludes cost effective application in many areas of interest. Moreover, it also requires a large, very complex and costly interface device to adapt the unit under test to the tester.An optimal automatic tester would have several important attributes. In particular, it should be capable of simple, low cost, rapid GO NO GO identification of analog hybrid digital modules, present a simple interface to the unit under test, be programmable in a high level language, such as ATLAS, and provide for on line modification of test parameters.It is accordingly a general object of the present invention to overcome the aforementioned limitations and drawbacks associated with the known test systems and to fulfill the needs mentioned by providing a programmable tester having characteristics more nearly approaching the optimal attributes noted above.It is a specific object of the present invention to provide a programmable tester which is compatible with a large number of dissimilar electronic units to be tested.Other objects will be apparent in the following detailed description of the invention.The foregoing and other objects and advantages which will be apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment, or in the practice of the invention, are achieved by the invention disclosed herein, which generally may be characterized as programmable test apparatus comprising connecting means for receiving interface means configured to adapt a unit under test to said test apparatus, said interface means including means for non volatilely storing a test program for testing the operation of said unit under test system bus means microcomputer means operatively connected to said system bus means and including means for executing said test program memory means associated with said microcomputer means operatively connected to said system bus means, microprocessor control means operatively connected to said system bus means and including means for loading said stored test program into said microcomputer memory means programmable stimulus generating means operatively connected via said system bus means to said microprocessor control means and said microcomputer means programmable response measuring means operatively connected via said system bus means to said microprocessor control means and microcomputer means programmable switching means for selectively connecting said stimulus generating means and said response measuring means via said interface means to said unit under test, said switching means responsive to and operatively connected via a switching control bus means to said microprocessor control means alphanumeric display means operatively connected via a first dedicated bus to said microprocessor control means and keyboard means operatively connected via a second dedicated bus to said microprocessor control means and including means for initiating execution of said test program.

As shown therein, the tester consists of a number of functional units, each of which is described below.The non volatile memory 1 which may consist, for example, of an Intel iSBC 464, holds up to 64K bytes ofEPROM ROM which contain an interpreter and instrument drivers. The interpreter interprets the interpretive code IC program which is loaded into the RAM located on microcomputer 2, which may consist, for example, of an Intel iSBC 86 12 single board computer, and passes to the instrument drivers the parameters and commands that they require. Microcomputer 2 contains 32K bytes of RAM and can hold up to 16K bytes of EPROM ROM. The RAM is divided into two functional areas wherein 16K bytes of RAM are reserved for holding the IC form of the test program when it is read from the Interface Device ID not shown . The remaining portion of the RAM is used for scratchpad, interrupt addresses, stack, etc. TheEPROM ROM contains a monitor, an executive, a self test program, interrupt handling routines, and a program for reading the IC test program from the ID, or software station not shown , into the RAM, r a program for controlling the alphanumeric A N display 12, and a program for reading and writing to the keyboard 13.The instrument drivers accept parameters and commands trom the interpreter and send parameters and commands to the instruments. The instrument drivers can also read information back from the instruments and pass the information back to microcomputer 2 for use by the test program.

The microprocessor control subsystem performs several functions. In particular, it provides an interface between a software station not shown and the system bus 25. This enables loading test programs which are under delevopment directly from the software station into the RAM on the microcomputer 2 without the need for non volatile memory in the ID which is the normal source of the test program. It provides an interface between the keyboard 13 and microcomputer 2 allowing the operator to communicate with and control the tester via the keyboard. The microprocessor control subsystem also provides an interface between microcomputer 2 and theIC test program in the ID.This provides the electrical path and buffering necessary to load the IC test program from the non volatile memory in the ID into theRAM on microcomputer 2. Furthermore, the microprocessor control subsystem provides the interface between microprocessor 2 and the A N display 12. And finally, the microprocessor control subsystem contains the microprocessor and program necessary to determine the proper relay paths in the programmable switching subsystem to close in order to connect an instrument to the proper I O pin from the parameter information passed to it by the switching circuit instrument driver.

When operated under control of the ATLAS programmer, the programmer can use display 12 as he chooses to aid the operator in running the specific test program. The programmer can, for example, display the value of a digital multimeter reading or he can inform the operator that an adjustment must be made on the UUT.When operated under control of the executive program, the executive program uses display 12 to pass information to the operator concerning matters other than a specific ATLAS test program. For example, the operator is informed of the results of Self Test and is given cues to install the ID and UUT prior to beginning an ATLAS test program.The interface which enables communication between the microcomputer 2 and the display 12 is located in the programmable microprocessor control subsystem 3. Data is passed between microcomputer 2 and microprocessor control subsystem 3 via the system bus 25. Data is passed between microprocessor control subsystem 3 and display 12 via a dedicated bus.The keyboard 13 is a conventional model, such as, for example, the Burr Brown MT 25. Keyboard 13 contains the hexidecimal numbers 0 through F, a decimal, a dash, clear CL . Input IN , and seven special function keys ST, SS, EW, FLT, a comma, LOAD, GO .

Data is passed between microcomputer 2 and microprocessor control subsystem 3 via the system bus 25. Data is passed between microprocessor control subsystem 3 and keyboard 13 via a dedicated bus. A conventional pushbutton 14 is used to reset the tester A block diagram of the programmable digital signal generator 15 is illustrated in Figure 10. The programmable digital signal generator contains 32 digital signal lines arranged in four qroups of eight lines each. Eacq group can be independently programmed as an output group or an input group. Commands and data pass between the programmable digital signal generator and its instrument driver via the system bus 25. The input and outputs of the programmable digital signal generator are TTL compatible. As configured, the programmable tester includes five separate adjustable DC power supplies 16 which are used to provide power to the UUT. The power supplies 16 are stock commercial parts available from, for example,ACOPIAN. These power supplies are adjusted manually.Front panel knobs 17 are used to manually set the voltages of power supplies 16.A block diagram of the power supply control network 18 is illustrated in Figure 11. As shown therein, it has the following circuits mounted on it. a 12V P.S. b UUT P.S. Monitor When each UUT power supply is adjusted this circuit connects the output of the power supply to the programmable digital multimeter 8 which provides a digital representation of the power supply output voltage to microcomputer 2 which in turn causes the voltage to be displayed on the alphanumeric display 12. In addition, the information from this circuit is used to prevent power supply voltages from being applied to the UUT until all are within tolerance. c Internal P.S. Monitor This circuit monitors the DC voltages required for operation of the programmable tester. The status of the monitor is checked during Self Test d Transfer Relay Drivers These, are programmable relay drivers associated with the relays that are used to switch AC and DC power to the ID interface connector 26. e Interface Circuit This circuit interfaces the system bus 25 to the remainder of the circuits of this network so that commands and data can be exchanged with microcomputer 2 over the system bus 25.A standard power supply 19 such as, for example, the LHResearch Style MML 47 Power Supply is used to provideD.C. power for the tester circuits and to circuits in the ID, IF necessary. The power supply has seven output voltages 15, 15, 24, 24, 24, 5, 12 VDC. Transfer relays 20, such as, for example MS27401 l, switch the AC and DC power to the UUT. AC power is switched under programm control. DC power is also under pronrom bn butt Cannot be switched until all UUT supply voltages are within tolerance. If required, a DC fan 21 may be used for cooling.A block diagram of the optional IEEE 488 interface network 22 is Illustrated in Figure 12. It provides the electrical interface and protocol requirements necessary to allow the user to connect an instrument of his own to the tester if the user s instrument isIEEE 488 1975 bus compatible.A standard filter 23 may be used to decrease the coupling of noise between the tester and the user s AC input power line. A standard combination circuit breaker on off switch 24 is provided on the front panel of the tester.Most of the circuits in the programmable tester are mounted on standard 6 3 4 x 12 circuit cards. The cards plug into a standard INTEL SBC 604 or SBC 614 modular backplane and cardcage. These devices serve as a cardcage and provide system bus 25 connections to all of the cards. The tester uses 5 SBC 614 1 SBC 604 which provides room for 24 cards. As configured, the programmable tester uses 13 cards leaving 11 spare card positions for future expansion.The ID interface 26 consists of a well on the horizontal surface of the tester front panel and 3 low insertion force connectors at the bottom of the well. Each connector has 256 contacts. A typical ID would plug into the connectors at the bottom of the well. TheID utilizes 1, 2 or 3 mating connectors depending on the particular signals to which it must connect.The Interface Device ID is a plug in adapter that holds the firmware and provides the electrical mechanical interface via connectors, wiring, and in addition provides room for locating circuitry for modification of signals if necessary. The ID is not part of the programmable tester but does plug into it.An ID is prepared in the following manner 1 obtain schematic diagram of particular UUT and specifications on UUT connectors 2 mount mating connectors for UUT on ID 3 obtain tester interface drawings 4 analyze UUT to determine test requirements and need for special interface circuits if required 5 design ID providing enough room to hold the non volatile semiconductor memories that will contain the test program 6 write the test program for the UUT in the DOD standard test language ATLAS 7 use software station which contains conversion program to convert the ATLAS test program into a different form this new form of the ATLAS test program is called an Interpretive Code IC program. The tester is not required for this step. 8 the IC program is now loaded into one or more non volatile memories. Many types of non volatile memory can be used. EPROM is preferred but PROM, ROM, can be used. These forms of non volatile memory are quite suitable for most test programs but in the case of very large test programs the tester can be modified to use bubble, CCD, floppy disc, hard disc or tape memories. The floppy disc, hard disc and tape memories are capable of storing very large programs but are not easily located within te ID, 9 the non volatile memory containing the IC program is now mounted in the ID. If a floppy disc, hard disc or tape are used they probably would not be located in the ID, they would be mounted in a separate enclosure adjacent to the tester.The operation of the programmable tester illustrated inFigure 1 is as follows. Immediately following turn on of the tester the operation of the tester is under control of microcomputer 2. Turning the tester on causes microcomputer 2 to begin executing an executive program which is stored in a non volatile memory located on the microcomputer 2 card . This executive program will cause initialization of the tester hardware and will automatically perform a confidence test of the tester to insure that it is operating properly.The executive program is written to that the operator will be notified via alphanumeric display 12 if failure within the tester exists and the suspect cards will be listed. If the tester is operating properly the executive program will cause the alphanumeric display 12 to indicate to the operator that he should insert the proper ID Interface Device UUT Unit Under Test and then actuate the keyboard Load command. Upon actuation of the keyboard Load command, the executive program will cause microcomputer 2 to read the IC form of the test program from the non volatile memory stored in the ID and load it into the RAM memory on the computer. The non volatile memory containing the IC form of the test program is in the memory gap of the microcomputer 2. Upon completion of the load operation the executive program will cause alphanumeric display 12 to display the name of the UUT using data supplied from the test program.The executive proqram will then cause alphanumeric display 12 to prompt the operator to actuate the keyboard 13 GO command. Upon actuation of GO, the ATLAS test program in IC form directs the microcomputer 2 to perform the test. The first step in most tests will be the adjusting of the DC voltages required to power up the UUT. The alphanumeric display 12 prompts the operator to adjust each power supply 16 as required. The alphanumeric display 12 Indicates the power supply designation ti.e., num 1, 2, 831 4, 5 , the present output voltage of the power supply, and the desired output of the power supply. The power supplies are adjusted manually by the operator via front panel thumb wheel controls 17. The tester itself is essentially automatic in operation except for the adjustment of these power supplies. When all supplies are within tolerance alphanumeric display 12 prompts the operator to actuate keyboard 13 GO. Unless the UUT requires manual intervention the test will now run automatically to completion.The test can either be GO NO GO or FaultIsolation.The Atlas test program, now in IC form and having just been read from the permanent memory in the ID into theRAM on microcomputer 2, causes the tester to perform tests in a manner similar to that of the CAT testers marketed by the assignee of the present invention except for the manual adjustment of the power supplies. The IC form test program, when interpreted by the interpreter resident on the iSBC 464 non volatile memory 1, will cause the stimuli instruments through the instrument driver programs also resident on the iSBC 464 to be set to the desired output, and the response instruments to be set to the desired output, and the response instruments to be set to the desired range, and the switching circuit to connect the instruments as required. Instruments of the type shown in Figs. 6, 7 are listed in Hewlett Packard Measurement Computation Electronic Instruments and Systems Catalog for 1980 on the page indicated Counter Timer C T 5328A Page 310 andDigital Multimeter DMM 3438A Page 62. Both instruments would have to be repackaged for use in the present invention. In addition, an interface circuit, shown as part of each instrument, would also be required to convert the signals on the microprocessor type bus to signals compatible with the HP IB bus. The design of the interface circuit is within the skill of a person having ordinary skill in the art. HP IB is a bus standard established by the Hewlett Packard Corp.It is clear that the above description of the preferred embodiment in no way limits the scope of the present invention which is defined by the following claims.
