# Card operated copying machine.

## Abstract
A card operated copying machine allows copying opera tion in response to insertion of one, at a time, of key checking cards CA for supervising copy counts for a plurality of sections. The card operated copying machine includes a key checking cards CA assigned respectively to the sections, b a processor for issuing a signal capable of copying operation, the processor 100 having a random access memory RAM2 for storing total copy counts respectively for the sections with flags indicative of permission and inhibition of copying operation, c a copy count display 56 for reading the data stored in the random access memory RAM2 and displaying the total copy count for each section, and d an inhibition card recording thereon in formation for setting the flags to an inhibition state. The copying operation is permitted and inhibited in response to the flag conditions.
