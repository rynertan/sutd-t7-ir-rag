# Method for coating and drying paper.

## Abstract
In the production of a coated paper, the paper is initially coated with an aqueous coating composition. The paper is then dried and calendered. Drying the paper at temperatures below the minimum filmforming temperature of the binder employed in the coating composition is ineffi cient due to the excessive time required in the dryer. Drying at conventional higher drying temperatures does not yield the desired degree of gloss in the final product. It has now been found that drying efficiency can be improved and a coated paper having high bulk, excellent gloss and low surface mottle can be prepared if the paper is initially dried at a temperature of up to about 20 F 11.1 C above the minimum filforming temperature of the binder until the moisture content of the paper is from about 8 to about 18 by weight and then the drying temperature is increased to further dry the paper.
