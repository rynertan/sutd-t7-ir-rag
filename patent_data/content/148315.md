# Method of controlling the output characteristic of a welding power source, apparatus for arc welding and electrical circuit to be used for such apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for arc welding particularly involves a pulse arc welding machine comprising a welding power source and a wire feeding unit, which consists of an output characteristic control circuit, an over load protection circuit, a driving circuit and a power main circuit for the former and a wire feeding control circuit, a motor driving circuit and a wire feed motor for the latter. A welding arc adaptive control system which can make the power source possess a multi segmental and moving output characteristic with varying slope, is used for the machine. Furthermore, an auto transfer circuit for connecting arbitrary number of segments with arbitrary or varying slope and a scanning circuit for obtaining the segment with varying slope have been put foreward. Particularly a self adaptive controlled GMA welding machine with one knob control of wire feed rate without necessity of adjusting other welding parame ters is easy to operate.
