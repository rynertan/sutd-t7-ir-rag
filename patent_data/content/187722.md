# Antibiotics called chloropolysporins B and C , a process for their preparation, and their therapeutic and veterinary use.

## Abstract
Novel compounds, called chloropolysporins B and C, and salts thereof have antibiotic properties and would appear to be members of the class of glycopeptide antibiot ics containing chlorine. They may be produced by cultivating a suitable strain of microorganism of the genus Micropoly spora, especially Micropolyspora sp. SANK 60983 FERM BP 538 . They may be combined with conventional phar maceutically acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use or incorporated into edible excipients, such as feed or water, for use as a growth promoting agent, especially for farm animals.
