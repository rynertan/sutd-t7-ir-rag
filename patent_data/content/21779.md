# Process for removal of sulfur and ash from coal.

## Abstract
The sulfur and ash content of coal particles is reduced by treating the coal particles in an aqueous slurry with a minor amount of hydrocarbon oil to form coal oil aggregates, incorporating a gas into or on the aggregates to modify their apparent density and then separating the aggregates from ash and mineral matter in the slurry by gravitational means. Optionally, the coal particles may be treated, prior to the aggregation step, with a conditioning agent which modifies or alters the existing surface characteristics of the ash and pyritic sulfur mineral matter. Recovered coal particles comprise a substantial part of the feed carbon values.
