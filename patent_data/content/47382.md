# ADAPTIVE COMPRESSION ENCODING OF A BINARY SOURCE SYMBOL STRING

## Abstract
This invention relates to a technique for appending prefixed code words to a code word stream conditioned by each least probable symbol in a binary source symbol string. The generation of the prefixed code word from a bounded code word space is managed dynamically by a memory 9 requiring only space availability measures 47, 51 at the start and end of the encoding cycle as input thereto. The memory delivers the prefixed code word of an appropriate derived length to output devices 7 for further processing. The encoder 2 , responsive to each input triplet of symbol, symbol estimate, and probability of occurrence measure, generates the space availability measures PC i and PG i l , and modifies the memory contents so as to reduce the remaining code space. This reduction reflects the fact that the particular code word delivered has been used up and cannot be the prefix of any future delivered code word. The length of each code word requested is composed of two components. The first is the run of most probable symbols component, and the second is the terminating least probable symbol com ponent. When the code word length requested exceeds the capacity of the memory to deliver, then the code word length is decreased to the maximum permissible. When the code word space is used up, the memory is considered overflowed and results in a reset in which the code capac ity is reinitialized.
