# Process for forming cushion articles.

## Abstract
A process for forming cloth covered cushion articles. A mold is provided having the shape of the desired cushion article. In one form, a cloth covering is drawn into the mold. Foamable material is poured into the mold and cured to form the cushion article. The covered, cured article is removed from the mold and heated to at least the heat fixable fiber set temperature of the cloth, as the cured foam acts as a male mold to hold the cloth in contour during heat setting. In another form, the foam is poured directly into the mold and cured. The cloth covering then is placed over the cured cushion and set.
