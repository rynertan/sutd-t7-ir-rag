# Rotary apparatus for advancing a web.

## Abstract
For use with a thermoforming press adapted to form individual articles in the body of a thermoplastic web 30 which has a degree of inherent stiffness, a trimming station 20 for trimming the formed articles 38 from the web subsequent to their formation characterized by a web transport 60 that comprises at least a pair of rotary advancing devices 62, 62 , 63, 63 directly engaged with the web at spaced apart locations across the width of the web, a drive 66, 68 for periodically rotating the advancing devices to produce indexing movement to the trimming press and means 69, 124 to periodically release the drive engagement of the rotary advancing devices with the web to enable relaxation of stress developed in the thermoplastic web and to allow the interaction of the web with the guides 20, 24 to realign the web in the absence of constraint by the rotary advancing devices, and the method of operation thereof. In the embodiment shown the rotary advancing devices positively engage the web, the drive is accurately controlled to move the web a predetermined dis tance after a sensor 90 senses the approach of the formed article 38 toward the trimming position, and the release of the advancing means occurs after the trim die 80, 82 has engaged the web, during selected trim cycles.
