# Schottky gate field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A Schottky gate field effect transistor comprises a semi insulative semiconductor substrate 10 , an active layer 12 formed on one surface of the substrate, a source electrode 16 and a drain electrode 14 on the active layer in ohmic contact thereto, respectively, a first Schottky gate electrode 18 on the active layer between the source and drain electrodes, and a second Schottky gate electrode 20 on the active layer between the drain electrode and the first gate electrode. A portion of the active layer underneath the second gate electrode has a sheet resistance smaller than that of the active layer portion underneath the first gate electrode. The source electrode and the second gate elec trode are electrically interconnected by connection means 22 formed on the substrate.
