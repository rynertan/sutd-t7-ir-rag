## Description
STABILISED MONOLITHIUM ACETYLIDE AND THE ETHYNYLATION OF STEROIDS This invention relates to stabilised monolithium acetylide and the ethynylation of steroids. The ethynylation of 17 keto steroids, to give commercially important 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy steroids, is well known and described in, for example,US A 2272131, US A 2843609, US A 2723280, US A 2877240,US A 3275666, US A 3470217, US A 4041055, Steroids , byFieser and Fieser, Reinhold Publishing Co., New York 1959 557 591, and J.A.C.S. 78 1956 2477. One known method of ethynylation comprises reacting the 17 keto steroid with dipotassium acetylide. An 4 advantage of this method is that A 3 keto steroids can be ethynylated, without there being any need to protect the 3 keto group. However, it is well known that this method cannot be used to ethynylate 16a methyl 17 keto, 16ss methyl 17 keto or 16 methylene 17 keto steroids these are reactions of importance because the corresponding 17a ethynyl steroids can be transformed to dexamethasone, betamethasone and melengestrol acetate. Metal acetylides other than dipotassium acetylide are known. Monosodium acetylide is disclosed inUS A 3470217 and by Tedeschi et al., J. Org. Chem. 34 1969 435. Mono and bis magnesium acetylides are disclosed by Skattebol et al., J.A.C.S. 1956 4765 US A 3704253 discloses their use for 17a ethynyl introduction, but there is substantial dimer formation. In many cases,lithioacetylide reagents exhibit substantially different reactivity from other metal acetylides. This fact, and the ready availability of n butyllithium, have resulted in the extensive use of these reagents in syntheses. The covalent nature of the carbon lithium bond has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations see, for example, Moffat, J. Mol. Structure 42 1977 251, andStreitwieser et al., J.A.C.S. 98 1976 4778. Midland, J. Org. Chem. 40 1975 2250, reacted n butyllithium with acetylene in THF at low temperature 70 and in dilute solution to produce monolithium acetylide. Monolithium acetylide is a valuable reagent for the preparation of ethynyl carbinols and terminal acetylenes, see Fieser and Fieser, Reagents forOrganic Synthesis, Vol. 1, Wiley, New York, 1967, p 573. Midland found that warming or attempting to generate a more concentrated solution resulted in disproportionation to the insoluble dilithium acetylide and acetylene. This disproportionation is an important disadvantage and occurs in the absence of a complexing agent, seeCorbellini et al., Chem. Ind. Milan 42, 251 1960 and Chem Abstr.54, 19250 1960 . To reduce or prevent the disproportionation the monolithium acetylide is usually prepared in liquid ammonia, which presumably serves as an appropriate complexing agent. An amine such as ethylenediamine can also be used to stabilize monolithium acetylide. Ethylenediamine so greatly stabilizes monolithium acetylide that monolithium acetylide is sold commercially as an ethylenediamine complex. Ethylenediamine while stabilizing monolithium acetylide to the point it can be sold commercially actually reduces the reactivity to the point it is not useful for many ethynylation procedures. The addition of a lithiated acetylene species to a 166 methyl 17 ketone in 92 yield was reported by G. Neef, et al., inJ. Org. Chem. 43, 4679 1978 without giving any experimental data but stating, The ethynylations were performed according to the procedure of Phillips... The procedure of Phillips is set forth in J. Med.Chem. 11, 924 1968 . The results reported by Neef could not be reproduced the Phillips procedure consistently gave large amounts greater than 20 of irreversible enolization. Neef also reported the addition of a lithiated acetylene species to a 16 methyl 17 keto steroid. The yield Neef reported 72 is more in keeping with the observed irreversible enolization. US Patent 4,055,562 used monolithium acetylide to ethynylate 17keto steroids unsubstituted in the C16 position. The monolithium acetylide was prepared by bubbling acetylene into THF held at 700 under anhydrous conditions followed by addition of butyllithium. The 17 keto steroid was added to the unstabilized monolithium acetylide and the mixture stirred for 3 hr at 700 to produce the 17a ethynyl176 hydroxy steroid product. EP A 0104054 discloses and claims the reaction of aC3 protected 16 methylene 17 keto steroid with an excess of monolithium acetylide cooled to 20 C or below. US A 4320236 discloses the use of a monolithium acetylide ammonia complex to ethynylate unsaturated acyclic ketones at below 30 C temperatures of 50 to 10C are reported in the Examples. The unsaturated acyclic ketones are very reactive 16 methyl 17 keto steroids, being highly substituted sterically hindered cyclopentanones, are much less reactive. It would be desirable to provide a stabilised monolithium acetylide which can be prepared, and react, at up to 0 C, with 16a and 16ss methyl and 16 methylene 17 keto steroids to produce 16 substituted 17a ethynyl 17B hydroxy steroids, preferably in high yield and with little or no epimerisation or destruction of the 16 methylene group. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a two pot process for preparing monolithium acetylide comprises 1 dissolving acetylene in a dry or anhydrous solvent 2 contacting a stabilising amine with an organo lithium compound at or below 0 C and 3 contacting the product of step 2 with the solution of step 1 at or below 0 C. According to a second aspect of the present invention, a one pot process for preparing monolithium comprises 1 dissolving acetylene in a dry or anhydrous solvent 2 contacting a stabilising amine with the solution of step 1 and 3 contacting an organolithium compound with the mixture of step 2 at or belowO C. According to a third aspect of the present invention, an in situ process for preparing monolithium acetylide comprises 1 dissolving acetylene in a dry or anhydrous solvent 2 contacting a 17 keto steroid with the mixture of step 1 3 contacting a stabilising amine with an organo lithium compound at about O or less and 4 contacting the mixture of step 3 with the carbonyl acetylene mixture of step 2 at about 0 or less. Disclosed is a process for the preparation of a C3 protected form of a 17a ethynyl 17i3 hydroxy 16 methyi steroid II A,C which comprises 1 contacting a C3 protected form of a 17 keto 16 methyl steroid I A,C with monolithium acetylide in a dry solvent at a temperature of about 0 or less 2 maintaining the reaction temperature at about 0 or less and 3 quenching with a quenching agent. Further disclosed is a process for the preparation of a 17 ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16 methyl steroid II B which comprises 1 contacting a 17 keto 16 methyl steroid I B with monolithium acetylide in a dry solvent at a temperature of about 200 or less 2 maintaining the reaction temperature at about 20 or less and 3 quenching with a quenching agent. Also disclosed are 17a ethynyl 3Xl7g dihydroxy l6ss methylandrosta 3,5 diene 3 methyl ether, 17a ethynyl 3,17ss dihydroxy 166 methylandrost 5 ene 3 THP ether, 17a ethynyl 3,17B di hydroxy 168 methylandrosta 3,5,9 11 triene 3 methyl ether, 17a ethynyl 176 hydroxy 16B methylandrost 4 en 3 one, 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16ss methylandrosta 4,9 11 dien 3 one, and 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16ss methylandrosta 1,4,9 11 trien 3 one. Disclosed is a process for the preparation of a C3 protected 17a ethynyl 11ss hydroxy 16 methylene steroid IV A,C which comprises 1 contacting a C3 protected 17 keto 16 methylene steroid III A,C with stabilized monolithium acetylide in a dry solvent at a temperature of about O or less 2 maintaining the reaction temperature at about 0 or less and 3 quenching with a quenching agent. Further disclosed is a process for the preparation of a 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16 methylene steroid IV B which comprises 1 contacting a 17 keto 16 methylene steroid III B with stabilized monolithium acetylide in a dry solvent at a temperature of about 20 or less 2 maintaining the reaction temperature at about 20 or less and 3 quenching with a quenching agent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The 16 methylene 17 keto steroid III starting materials are well known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known compounds by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, 16 methylene 17 keto steroids III where R6 is methyl, a fluoro and methylene are known, see U.S. Patents 3,166,551, 2,838,942 and 3,980,778 respectively. 16 Methylene 17 Keto steroids I with C ring substitution are known, for example, 9a hydroxy U.S.Patent 3,065,146 , a9 1 U.S. Patent 4,127,596 , 11ss hydroxy and 11 keto U.S. Patent 2,867,630 . Further, these steroids are known in the C3 protected forms, for example, the enol ether U.S. Patent 3,516,991 and the 3 enamine U.S. Patent 4,216,159 . The 16 methylene 17 keto steroid III starting materials are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, U.S.Patents 3,275,666, 3,300,521 and 3,641,069, Gazz. Chim. Ital. 91, 672 1961 , Hungarian Patent 019,495 and U.S. Patent 4,416,821. It is preferred that the 16 methylene 17 keto III starting materials be prepared by the process of US Patent 4,416,821. The 16 methylene 17 keto steroids IIIA C starting materials may have variable substituents at positions 1, 6, 9, 10 and 11, as is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 4,416,821 discloses 16 methylene 17 keto steroids with Al, 6 fluoro, 6 methyl, 11ss hydroxy, 11 keto, 11a hydroxy, a9 ll , 98,llg epoxy, and 9a fluoro substitution as well as combinations thereof. It is preferred in the 4 3 keto series A that R6 be a hydrogen atom, methyl or methylene group but in the al 4 3 keto series B that R6 be a hydrogen or fluorine atom. The 16a and 168 methyl 17 keto steroids I are well known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art from known compounds. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,010,958, 3.039,528 and 3,704,253. For the 168 methyl 17 keto steroids I P. deRuggieri, et al., Gazz. Chim.Ital. 91, 672 1961 on page 678 disclosed a 3 step process for the transformation of a 17 keto steroid to the corresponding 16ss methyl 17 keto steroid I in about 40 yield. The yield of that reaction can be greatly increased, and it is preferred to prepare the 16ss methyl 17 keto steroids from 17 keto steroids by the process of USPatent 4,451,404. The 17 keto steroids I starting materials are well known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known compounds by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, 17 keto steroids I where R6 is methyl, a fluoro and methylene are known, see U.S. Patents 3,166,551, 2,838,942 and 3,980,778 respectively. 17 Keto steroids I with C ring substitution are known, for example, 9 hydroxy U.S. Patent 3,065,146 , A3 L1 U.S.Patent 4,127,596 , 11ffi hydroxy and 11 keto U.S. Patent 2,867,630 .Further, these steroids are known in the C3 protected forms, for example, the enol ether U.S. Patent 3,516,991 and the 3 enamine U.S. Patent 4,216,159 . The 17 keto steroids IA IC may or may not have to have the functionality at C3 protected during the ethynylation reaction depending on the nature of the steroid A ring A C, see Chart B andC . For the d4 3 keto steroids A , the C3 ketone is protected as the enol ether Aa , ketal Ab , or enamine Ac as is well known in the art, see Chart C. The preferred enol ether Aa is the methyl or ethyl ether. The preferred ketal Ab is the ethylene ketal. The preferred enamines Ac are selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidine, morpholine and di ethyl ami no amines. The enol ethers a are prepared by methods well known in the art, see J. Org. Chem. 26, 3925 1961 , Steroid Reactions, Edited by Carl Djerassi, Holden Day,San Francisco 1963, page 42 45, and U.S. Patent 3,516,991 Preparation 1 .The ketals b are also prepared by well known methods, seeSteroid Reactions, supra, page 11 14. The 3 enamines c are also prepared by methods well known in the art, see U.S. Patents 3,629,298 and 4,216,159 and Steroid Reactions, supra, page 49 53. The t 4 3 keto steroids B do not have to have the C3 ketone protected. The 3 hydroxy steroid C should have the 3 hydroxyl group protected as the ether Ca , see Chart C. The preferred blocking groups are the methyl, ethyl, tetrahydropyranyl THP and trimethylsilyl ethers. Monolithium acetylide is known, see M. M. Midland, J. Org. Chem.40, 2250 1975 and US Patents 4,055,562 and 4,320,236. The monolithium acetylide can be prepared in different ways which is of importance because the temperature used in preparation is dependent on the method of preparation. The monolithium acetylide can be prepared by bubbling acetylene through an etheral solvent such as THF at about 20 250 until no further weight gain occurs about 0.6M in acetylene . An aliquot of this solution is cooled to about 600 and 4 equivalents per equivalent of steroid of an organo lithium reagent such as n butyllithium, methyllithium or phenyllithium are added with vigorous stirring to give a mixture which is about 0.57M in monolithium acetylide. Temperatures above about 100 and concentrations above about 0.8M in monolithium acetylide cause disproportionation to the insoluble dilithium acetylide.Therefore, slow addition of pre cooled 200 or less organo lithium reagent to very cold solution of acetylene in a dry solvent such as THF, dimethyl ether, dioxane, andDME is preferred. It is preferred the temperature be kept at 80 to 25 , more preferably at 80 to 400. If the organic solvent is at a temperature of 400 or warmer, the organo lithium solution should be added slower using a higher stirring rate to facilitate heat transfer.The monolithium acetylide solution should be used immediately after preparing as letting it stand even at 780 for 6 hours may lower the yield 10 . A stabilized monolithium acetylide is preferably used. It permits preparation of the monolithium acetylide at higher temperatures which is commercially advantageous. The stabilized monolithium acetylide is prepared in 3 alternative ways, two pot preferred , one pot or in situ. In the two pot process, a sufficient quantity of acetylene is first dissolved in a suitable dry organic solvent. The temperature at which the acetylene can be dissolved in the dry organic solvent is not critical. The temperature affects the solubility and therefore the concentration of the acetylene. However, before the acetylene solution is contacted with the lithium complex it must be cooled to 0 or less. The nature of the organic solvent is not critical so long as it does not react with acetylene, organolithium compounds or amines. Suitable dry organic solvents include THF, dioxane, dimethyl ether, tbutyl methyl ether and dimethoxyethane. The preferred solvent is THF.It is convenient for the organic solvent to be saturated with acetylene. Second, an organo lithium compound is contacted with a stabilizing amine at 0 or less in a suitable dry organic solvent.Organo lithium compounds include n butyllithium, phenyllithium, and methyl lithium, preferred is n butyllithium. A stabilizing amine is an amine primary, secondary or tertiary which when reacted with an organo lithium compound to form a lithium complex and or corresponding lithium amide subsequently reacted with acetylene forms a stabilized monolithium acetylide which will not significantly disproportionate at 0 and below which is reactive towards 17 keto steroids. Stabilizing amines include N,N diisopropyl ethyl amine, triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, t butyl amine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, hexamethyl disilazane, and pyrrolidine. Some amines such as pyrrolidine are only useful with some steroids such as 16ss methylandrosta 1,4,9 11 triene 3,17 dione. Amines which are not operable include ethylenediamine and pyridine.Preferred is diisopropylamine or triethylamine. The same dry organic solvents useful to dissolve the acetylene in are also useful here. It is preferred that the same solvent or mixture of solvents be used for dissolving the acetylene in as for the reaction of the organo lithium compound with the stabilizing amine. The reaction of the organo lithium compound with a primary or secondary amine produces a lithium amide. A tertiary amine cannot produce a lithium amide and forms a complex, the nature of which is not known.Therefore, the reaction of an organo lithium compound and a stabilizing amine will be considered to have produced a lithium complex. When the organo lithium compound is added to the stabilizing amine it must be added slowly maintaining the temperature at about 250 or less. The reaction is complete in less than 30 min. The third step of the two pot process is contacting the lithium complex of step 2 with the acetylene solution of step 1 at 0 or less.It is preferred that the method of contacting be a slow addition of the lithium complex to the acetylene solution keeping the temperature at 0 or less. The reaction forming monolithium acetylide is complete in about 30 min. In the two pot process, the first two steps which are independent of each other can be performed in the reverse order. The organolithium compound can be reacted with the stabilizing amine prior to the dissolving of the acetylene in the dry organic solvent. All that is necessary is that both steps be independently performed and the temperature of both mixtures be O or less before they are combined in the third step. The stabilized monolithium acetylide produced by the process of the present invention is reactive with aldehydes and ketones. It is preferred that the reactant be a 17 keto steroid. Commercially one of the most important uses of the ethynylation process is the transformation of 17 keto steroids to the corresponding 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy steroid. For example, androstenedione, a 17 keto steroid protected as the 3 enol ether is ethynylated to ethisterone Example 1 . Ethisterone by the process of US Patent 4,041,055 Examples 1, 5, 9 and 13 is converted to 17a hydroxyprogesterone. Androstenedione is a a4 3 keto steroid and can be ethynylated with di potassium acetylide preferably or monolithium acetylide.In Preparation 1 of US Patent 4,041,055 monolithium acetylide ethylene diamine was used, it is sufficiently reactive to react with androstenedione which has no substitution at Cl6 but is not sufficiently reactive to react with 16substituted 17 keto steroids such as 16a methyl , 16 3 methyl or 16methylene 17 keto steroids without serious side reactions. The monolithium acetylide produced by the process of the present invention is sufficiently stable at up to about 0 and is reactive with 16a methyl , 16methyl and 16 methylene 17 keto steroids. 16amethyl and 168 methyl 17 keto steroids are well known to those skilled in the art. 16 Methylene 17 keto steroids are also known, see for example US Patent 4,416,821. The 16 methyl 17 keto or 16 methylene steroids I or III to be ethynylated are added to the monolithium acetylide at 0 or less. The ethynylation reaction is complete in about 30 minutes. The 16 methyl17 keto I or 16 methylene 17 keto steroid III can be added as a solid, a slurry or as a solution. For convenience it is preferred that it be added as a solution. It should be added slowly as is known to those skilled in the art. Again, the same organic solvents used for steps 1 and 2 are useful for adding the material to be ethynylated to the monolithium acetylide. Again, it is preferable to use the same organic solvent as was used in steps 1 and 2. The ethynylated product is recovered by means well known to those skilled in the art. In the one pot process, the first step of dissolving the acetylene in a suitable dry organic solvent is the same as for the two pot process. Second, the stabilizing amine is added to the acetylene solution at 0 or less. Third, the organo lithium compound is added slowly to the mixture of the acetylene solution and the stabilizing amine again at 0 or less. With the in situ process, the first step again is the same.Second, the 16 methyl 17 keto I or 16 methylene steroid III to be ethynylated is added to the acetylene solution at 0 or less. Third, the organo lithium compound and the stabilizing amine are reacted to form the lithium complex as in the second step of the two pot process.Finally, the lithium complex is added slowly to the mixture of the acetylene solution containing the 16 methyl 17 keto I or 16 methylene steroid III to be ethynylated at 0 or less and the monolithium acetylide is generated in situ. While the above steps to prepare monolithium acetylide can be performed at 0 it is preferable to perform them at less than 200, more preferable in a temperature range of about 20 to about 400. Reducing the temperature reduces the amount of disproportionation, thereby increasing the amount of monolithium acetylide available for ethynylation. Regardless of how the monolithium acetylide is prepared two pot, one pot or in situ when it is contacted with the C3 protected 17keto 16 methyl I A,C or 16 methylene steroids III A,C at about 0 or less or the unprotected Al 4 3 keto 17 keto 16 methyl IB or 17keto 16 methylene IIIB steroids at about 200 or less, the reaction time is very short, in the range of 5 60 min usually about 10 15 min. The above discussion involves the temperatures at which the monolithium acetylide is prepared. The main advantage of using stabilized monolithium acetylide over non stabilized monolithium acetylide is that it can be prepared and reacted at warmer temperatures. The reaction temperature of the monolithium acetylide with the 16a and 166 methyl 17 keto I or 16 methylene 17 keto steroids III is usually about the same as the preparation temperature. If the reaction is performed above the decomposition temperature of the reagent, the yield will decrease.In the al,4 3 keto series B the reaction temperature must be lower than in the protected A4 3 keto A or 3 hydroxy C series because one must have selectivity for the monolithium acetylide with the C17 ketone over the unprotected C3 ketone. With the 16 methyl A4 3 keto IA and 3hydroxy IC steroids in their C3 protected form the ethynylation reaction is performed at about 10 or less, preferably at about 200 or less, more preferably at about 40 or less. With the 16 methyl Al,4 3 keto steroids IB the ethynylation reaction is performed at about 10 or less, preferably at about 400 or less, more preferably at about 700 or less. With the 16 methylene A4 3 keto IIIA and 3hydroxy IIIC steroids in their C3 protected form the ethynylation reaction is performed at about 0 or less, preferably at about 200 or less, more preferably at about 40 or less.With the 16 methylene A1,4 3 keto steroids IIIB the ethynylation reaction is performed at about 200 or less, preferably at about 40 or less, more preferably at about 50 or less. With the A1,4 3 keto 16 methyl 17 keto IB and al,4 3 keto 16 methylene steroids IIIB no C3 protecting group is necessary.However, it is preferable to add at least one equivalent of lithium ion prior to contacting the 17 keto steroid I with the monolithium acetylide. The lithium ion helps keep the selectivity for the 17 ketone over the 3 ketone. The lithium ion is added as a lithium salt, for example, lithium chloride, lithium sulfate, etc. Preferred is lithium bromide or lithium perchlorate. Using the lithium ion with A ,4 3 keto 16 methyl 17 keto IB and A1,4 3 keto 16 methylene steroids IIIB steroids permits the same yield and selectivity at 400 as was obtained without the lithium ion at 780. Generally, slightly more than one equivalent of monolithium acetylide per equivalent of 16 methyl 17 keto I or 16 methylene 17keto steroid III is used. With the 16a methyl , 16ss methyl and 16methylene 17 keto steroids I and III the more monolithium acetylide used up to 4 equivalents the better. Two equivalents are preferred and about four equivalents are more preferred. When the acetylene addition is complete the excess acetylide is quenched or destroyed by reaction with a quenching agent which is any system such as water, saline or aqueous buffers depending on what final pH is desired. The quenching agent can be any system which protonates the acetylide, e.g. water, saline, buffers or non aqueous systems containing protonating compounds, e.g. acetic acid, formic acid or other acid. Other quenching agents which are operable are those which will react with the acetylide such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or other ketones. The preferred quenching agent is acetone followed by aqueous acid. The 17a ethynyl 178 hydroxy 16 methyl II and 17a ethynyl 178 hydroxy 16 methylene steroids IV are obtained or isolated from the reaction mixture by means well known to those skilled in the art.In the case of the b4 3 keto steroids A and 3 hydroxy steroid C the 17a ethynyl 17B hydroxy steroids IIA,IIC, IVA and IVC are isolated as the C3 protected form. The C3 protecting group is removed by means well known to those skilled in the art or the C3 protecting group may be left on for further chemical modification. Before the 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy steroid 11 or IV is isolated the C3 protecting group can be hydrolyzed in situ so as to obtain the unprotected or free 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy steroid by reaction with a proton source such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid at 20 250. The acid is added until the pH is less than 2.For example, if the steroid IA or IIIA is protected as the enol ether a the protecting group can be removed by acid so that the 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy steroid II or IV will be isolated in the free t4 3 keto form A . The al 4 3 keto steroids B are not protected and therefore the 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy product II or IV will be in the free or unprotected form. The C3 protecting group is removed from the 3 hydroxy steroids C by reaction with a means for hydrolyzing the C3 protecting group which in the case of the ethers Ca includes acids with a pKa of less than 4.0. The reaction mixture is worked up by adding saline to the hydrolysis mixture which results in 2 phases. The organic phase is separated, washed, dried and concentrated to give the desired product.Alternatively the product may be knocked out by water addition and recovered by known procedures. The 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy l6 methyl steroids II are useful as intermediates in the preparation of 16 methyl 17a hydroxyprogesterones and 16 methyl corticoids, see U.S. Patent 4,041,055. For example, 17 alpha ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16ss methylandrosta 1,4,9 11 trien 3 one Examples 2 and 14 is transformed to 17a,21 di hydroxy 168 methyl pregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione by the process of U.S. Patent 4,041,055. This d9 ll corticoid is transformed by known methods to the bromohydrin, 9ss,11ss epoxide and finally to the corresponding 9a fluoro 11ss hydroxy compound which is betamethasone US Patent 3,485,854 . The 17 alpha ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16 methylene steroids IV are useful intermediates in the preparation of 17a hydroxy 16 methylene proges terones, see Chart D. The 17 alpha ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 16 methylene steroid IV is transformed to the corresponding 17ss hydroxy steroid V by reaction with a mercuric agent. Oxymercuration of ethisterone derivatives is old, see Helv. Chim. Acta. 26, 680 1943 . However, the present D ring is not a simple ethisterone derivative. Here the 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy substituents are allylic to a 16 methylene group.Surprisingly and unexpectedly quantitative yields of the 17ss hydroxy steroids V are obtained indicating that its allylic alcohol system did not compete with the propargyl alcohol system in the oxymercuration. The mercuric agent can be produced by reaction of mercuric oxide with a strong acid such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, or nitric acid.The mercuric salts, mercuric sulfate, mercuric chloride or mercuric nitrate can be used directly in acid medium. Mercuric sulfate or this salt made from mercuric oxide and sulfuric acid is preferred. A catalytic amount of a mercuric agent and the 17a ethynyl l7ss hydroxy 16 methylene steroid IV are contacted at 20 650 for 2 24 hr in an aqueous polar solvent. When the oxymercuration reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is filtered thru Celite to remove insoluble mercuric salt solids and the 17 3 hydroxy steroid V is recovered from the filtrate by means well known to those skilled in the art.Alternatively the oxymercuration reaction can be performed using the mercuric agent affixed to a resin. See M.S. Newman, J. Am. Chem.Soc., 75, 4740 1953 . The 17 3 hydroxy steroids V are next converted to the corresponding sulfoxides VI by reaction with a sulfenylating agent of the formula R22 S M VII . It is preferred that M is a chlorine or bromine atom, more preferred that M be a chlorine atom. It is preferred that R22 be methyl, phenyl, p chlorophenyl, p methoxyphenyl or p methylphenyl. It is more preferred that R22 be phenyl. The appropriately substituted sulfenylating agents VII are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, sulfuryl chloride is added to a thiol previously dissolved in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride. See Chem. Reviews, 39, 269 1946 at page 279 and U.S. patent 2,929,820. The sulfenylation reaction is carried out in a non polar aprotic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, di ethyl ether, or methylene chloride, THF, and dioxane or mixtures thereof. It is preferred that the solvent be methylene chloride. The reaction is carried out in the presence of at least an equal molar amount of a tertiary amine base, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine or pyridine. Trimethylamine is preferred. Any excess base serves as additional solvent for the reaction. The reaction is preferably carried out under an inert dry gas such as nitrogen, argon, or carbon dioxide.The substituted sulfenyl halide VII is added dropwise to the reaction mixture at a temperature of 200 to 400. Following addition of the substituted sulfenylating agent VII to the reaction mixture, the excess substituted sulfenylating agent is quenched with an appropriate quenching agent such as water, cyclohexene, various alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, or acetone. The sulfoxide VI may be obtained by standard work up. The sulfoxide VI exists as 2 double bond isomers the compound of formula VI and where the unsaturation is between Cl6 and the carbon atom attached to the sulfur atom. The endocyclic isomer VI usually predominates with only small amounts of the exocyclic isomer.However, the ratio of the isomeric sulfoxides is unimportant as both isomers are converted to the same product in the next step. The sulfoxides VI are converted to the corresponding 16 methylene 17a hydroxyprogesterones VIII by reaction with a thiophile with heat. The sulfoxides VI are placed in an appropriate solvent or mixture of solvents such as toluene, methanol, ethylene dichloride or acetone. Some thiophiles such as hydroxide, alkoxide, etc. produce undesirable side reactions others such as trimethylphosphite and diethylamine and mixtures thereof are more suitable. The preferred thiophile is trimethylphosphite. Trimethylphosphite is known as a thiophile, see D.A. Evans G.C. Andrews, Acct. of Chem. Res. 7, 147 1974 at p. 150. The sulfoxide VI and thiophile are contacted and heated from about 50 100 depending on solvent s , sulfoxide VI , thiophile, and whether or not the reaction is conducted under pressure.It is preferred to heat the reaction mixture from 60 90 in a sealed reacting container for 4 24 hr. When the reaction is complete the 16 methylene 17a hydroxyprogesterone VIII is isolated and purified by means well known to those skilled in the art. The 16 methylene 17a hydroxyprogesterones VIII are useful as intermediates in the production of commercial pharmaceutical agents in two ways. First, 16 methylene steroids are intermediates in the manufacture of certain progestational agents such as melengestrol acetate, and second where the 16 methylene group is reduced to 16a methyl or 16ss methyl to give intermediates useful in the production of antiinflammatory corticoids. For example, androstenedione can be converted to melengestrol acetate, a 16 methylene steroid in the following manner 1 androstenedione is converted to 6 methyleneandrost 4 ene 3,17 dione by the process of U.S.Patent 3,642,840, Example 18 2 6 methyl eneandrost 4 ene 3,17 di one is converted to 6 methyl an drosta 4,6 diene 3,17 dione by the process of U.S. Patent 3,117,966,Example 16 3 6 methylandrosta 4,6 diene 3,17 dione is converted to 6 methyl 16 methyleneandrosta 4,6 diene 3,17 dione III by the process of Hungarian Patent 019,495, Gazz. Chim. Ital. 91, 672 1961 or the above described process for transformation of a 17 keto steroid to the corresponding 16 methylene 17 keto steroid U.S.Patent 4,416,821 4 6 methyl 16 methyleneandrosta 4,6 diene 3,17 dione IIIA is converted to 17a ethynyl 17 3 hydroxy 6 methyl 16 methyleneandrosta 4,6 dien 3 one IVA by the process of the present invention, which is converted to 17a hydroxy 6 methyl 16 methylenepregna 4,6 diene 3,20 dione VIII as described above and 5 acylation of the 17a hydroxy 6 methyl 16 methylenepregna 4,6 diene 3,20 dione VIII to 17 acetyloxy 6 methyl 16 methylenepregna4,6 diene 3,20 dione melengestrol acetate by the process of U.S.Patent 4,154,748, Example 12. Alternatively, and preferably, the following sequence can be used 1 16 methyleneandrostenedione IIIA, Hungarian Patent 019,495, Example 3 is converted to 17a ethynyl 3,17 3 dihydroxy 16 methyleneandrosta 3,5 diene 3 methyl ether by the process of the present invention, then 2 the 17a ethynyl 3,17 3 dihydroxy 16 methyleneandrosta 3,5 diene 3 methyl ether is converted to 17a ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 6,16 dimethyleneandrost 4 en 3 one by the process of U.S.Patent 3,642,840, 3 the 17a ethynyl 175 hydroxy 6,16 dimethyleneandrost 4 en 3 one is then converted to the corresponding 17 3 hydroxy steroid V , sulfoxide VI and ultimately to 17a hydroxy 6,16 dimethylenepregn 4 ene 3,20 dione VIII , which upon reaction with acetic anhydride and p TSA forms 17 acetyloxy 6 methyl 16 methylenepregna 4,6 diene 3,20 dione, melengestrol acetate. The 16 methylene 17a hydroxyprogesterones VIII can readily be transformed into a 16 methylene corticoid by reaction with iodine, an excess of calcium oxide, an aqueous sodium hydroxide and potassium acetate in acetone as is well known, see for example H.J. Ringold, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80, 250 1958 , 0. Halpern, et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc. 81, 439 1959 and J. Org. Chem. 25, 1060 1966 . The 16methylene corticoid can then be readily transformed to a 166 methyl corticoid by the process of U.S. Patent 3,115,508 or to a 16a meth corticoid by the process of U.S. Patent 3,130,209. For example, betamethasone 9a fluoro 11 3,17a,21 trihydroxy 16 3 methylpregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione can be prepared from 17ss hydroxy 16 methylenepregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione VIII by first transforming it to 17 alpha ,21 dihydroxy 16 methylenepregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate by the process of J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80, 250 1958 , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 439 1959 and J. Org. Chem. 25, 1966 1960 and next transforming it to 17a,21 dihydroxy 16B methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate by the process of U.S. Patent 3,115,508. The transformation of 17 ,21 dihydroxy 16ss methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate to betamethasone is described in U.S.Patent 3,104,246, Examples I and II. Dexamethasone 9a fluoro 11 3,17a,21 trihydroxy 16a methylpregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione can also be prepared from 17ss hydroxy 16 methyl enepregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione VIII by first transforming it to 17 alpha ,21 dihydroxy 16 methylenepregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21acetate as described above and next transforming it to 17a,21 dihy droxy 16a methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate by the process of U.S. Patent 3,130,209. 17a,21 Dihydroxy 16a methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate is then epoxidized by means well known to those skilled in the art, see for example U.S.Patent 3,980,778, Examples 2 and 7 to produce 98,11B epoxy 17a,21 dihydroxy 16a methylpregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione which is transformed to dexamethasone 21 acetate by the process of U.S. Patent 3,007,932, Example 2. Likewise diflorasone diacetate 6a,9a difluoro 11 3,17a,21 tri hydroxy 16ss methylpregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17,21 diacetate can be produced using the process of the present invention. First, 6cx fluoro 11ss hydroxyandrosta 1,4 diene 3,17 dione U.S. Patent 2,867,630 is dehydrated to 6G fluoroandrost 1,4,9 11 triene 3,17 dione by means well known to those skilled in the art, see SteroidReactions, C. Djerassi, Holden Day, San Francisco, 1963 p. 238 239. The 16 methylene group is then added by the process of U.S. Patent 4,416,821 to produce 6a fluoro 16 methyleneandrosta 1,4,9 11 triene 3,17 dione IIIB which is converted to 6a fIuoro 17 hydroxy 16 methylenepregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione VIII . The 21 hydroxy function of the corticoids is next introduced as described above followed by transformation of the 16 methylene group to a 16ss methyl group also described above to give 6a fluoro 17a,21 dihydroxy 16 3 methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 21 acetate which is acylated according to the procedure described in U.S.Patent 4,154,748 Examples 6 and 7 to produce 6a fluoro 17a,21 dShydroxy 16ss methylpregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 17,21 diacetate U.S. Patent 3,980,778, Example 6 . 6a Fluoro 17a,21 di hydroxy 168 methylp regn a 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione 17,21 diacetate is then converted to diflorasone acetate by the process of U.S. Patent 3,980,778 Examples 7 and 8 .
