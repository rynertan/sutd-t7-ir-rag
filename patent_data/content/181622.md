# Algae cultivating device.

## Abstract
The plant comprises a structure made of cylinders 11 and constructed by vertically setting up cylinders in water and connecting the respective cylinders with each other by use of horizontal cylinders 12 , a solar ray collecting device 20 installed on the water surface above the structure, and a culture device 30 for cultivating algae or the like installed in water. Solar rays collected by the solar ray collecting device being transmitted to the culture device for cultivating the algae or the like through an optical conductor cable 40 and employed as a photo synthesis light source for the algae or the like. The culture device cultivating the algae or the like by utilizing carbon dioxide CO₂, phosphor, nitrogen, nutritious salt, etc. contained in water, and algae or the like created by cultivation and carbon dioxide CO₂ being discharged into water.
