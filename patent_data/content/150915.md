# Machine tool shaft drive system.

## Abstract
A machine tool 10 with one or more axially movable tool carrying spindles 40 is provided with a drive system for trans ferring drive to the spindle s from a driving shaft parallel to the spindle s . The driving shaft, e.g. a motor shaft, carries a plain cylindrical pulley 38 and driven pulley s are provided on the driven spindle s . A poly vee belt 42 is entrained around the pulleys and the or each driven pulley is formed with an outer surface shaped to enter at least one of the grooves of the poly vee belt. In use the driven spindle s may be moved axially rela tive to the driving shaft the belt is retained by the driven pul ley s and rides axially along the surface of the driving pulley. The drive system allows rapid axial movement without vibra tion or overshoot and provides high traction. It has particular utility in high speed drilling and routing machines and the like.
