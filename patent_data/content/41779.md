## Description
This invention relates to a colouration process in which dyestuffs are fixed on an aromatic polyester substrate through the action of c.ertain electromagnetic radiation. Aromatic polyester is conventionally coloured by dyeing, padding or printing processes using disperse dyestuffs. In the case of dyeing1 the polyester in the form of yarn or tow, or of woven or knitted textile material, is immersed in an aqueous dyebath containing one or more disperse dyestuffs and fixation is achieved either at a temperature of about 10000 in the presence of a carrier, or in the absence of a carrier at a temperature in the region of 13000 by conducting the dyeing process at superatmospheric pressure. In either case the process may take up to one hour or even longer.In the case of padding or printing methods1 a padding liquor or printing paste containing the disperse dyestuff is applied to an aromatic polyester textile material, which is then preferably dried and subjected to a heat treatment to fix the dyestuff on the material. This heat treatment can, for example, comprise treatment with superheated steam or in steam either at atmosphc ic pressure or under superatmospheric pressure tr a baking treatment in hot air at temperatures in the region of 1500 to 2300 , or by passing the material over a heated surface, for example, over a calendar at 1500 to 23000. At the conclusion of the dyeing, padding or printing operation the coloured polyester is usually given a reduction clear treatment in warm aqueous alkaline sodium hydrosulphite solution, followed by one or more further rinses in warm aqueous detergent solution, warm water and finally cold water in order to ensure complete removal of any unfixed dyestuff and any additives which ere present in the dyebath, padding liquor or printing paste. After the rinsing sequence the coloured material then has to be dried. All of these conventional colouration processes are energy intensive because of the considerable heat input at the fixation, rinsing and drying stages, and therefore costly. They are also time consuming and use large quantities of water. A colouration process for aromatic polyester fibre or textile material has now been developed in which substantial reductions in energy and water usage, and in time of operation, may be achieved compared with the conventional processes. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the colouration of a substrate of aromatic polyester fibre, alone or blended with other fibres, and textile materials fabricated therefrom, which comprises applying to the substrate a disperse dyestuff and at least one organic liquid having a high dielectric loss factor, a minimum boiling point of at least 120 C and a maximum boiling point below the melting point of aromatic polyester or other fibres, the substrate then being exposed to a radiofrequency or microwave field, thereby to heat the organic liquid and to fix the dyestuff on the substrate. The radiofrequency band for heating purposes covers the 2MHz to 100MHz range while microwave frequencies are in the range 400 MRz to 3000 tiz. It is not possible to use all the frequencies within these bands for industrial purposes as this would cause interference with communications systems, and by international agreement it has been decided that only specific frequencies can be used. It the radiofrequency range these are 15.56 fez7 27.12MHz and 40.68MHz, and in the microwave range they are 896MHz and 24500iHz. The substrate may be in the form of yarn, loose stock or tow, or of woven or knitted textile material.In the latter case the process is particularly well adapted to continuous operation. The disperse dyestuff which is used in the abovc process may be any of those disperse dyestuffs which are known from the art or used in practice for the colouration of aromatic polyester, for example those disperse dyestuffs which are disclosed in the 3rd Edition of theColour Index, published 1971 b1 the Society of Dyers andColourists. Mixtures of such dyestuffs may be used. The term dielectric loss factor in the above definition is defined as the product of the dielectric constant of the material under consideration and tan b, where √è is the angle by which the current in the material being irradiated lags behind the current in a perfect capacitor. The value of the loss factor varies with frequency and temperature, but in the present instance it is required that it maintains a high value over the temperature range and irradiating frequency of the process. The organic liquids having a high dielectric loss factor for use in the process must have a boiling point of at least 1200C and below the melting point of aromatic polyester. This upper boiling point limit is effectively approximately 2500C, and suitable organic liquids are, for example, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether1 ethylene glycol monoisobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monohexyl ether1 ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol monoacetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, ethylene glycol dibutyrate, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, diethylene glycol diacetate and diethylene glycol diisobutyrate. The preferred organic liquids are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol propaiie 1,2 diol and dipropylene glycol because of their ready availability, cheapness and compatibility as components of dyestuff formulations. Mixtures of organic liquids as hereinbefore defined may be used. The organic liquid can be applied alone or as part of a dyestuff formulation. The disperse dyestuff and the organic liquid will generally be applied to the substrate in the form of a composition containing, in addition to the above mentioned ingredients, a dispersing agent for the dyestuff, in such proportions as to cause the dyestuff to be efficiently heated under the influence of radiofrequency or microwave radiation to a temperature below the melting point of the aromatic polyester substrate to which the composition is applied. The organic liquid can be used in admixture with water1 and will be used in this way in most cases since disperse liquid dyestuffs are mostly prepared in the form of aqueous dispersions. The organic liquid when part of the total dyestuff formulation then usually acts as a humectant, preventing drying out of the composition. The dispersing agent is chosen so that it is not an efficient absorber of radiation at temperatures above the melting point of the aromatic polyester substrate, or so that the quantity of dispersing agent present on the substrate is so small that its thermal capacity is too low to contribute significantly to the temperature of the substrate with which it is in contact. These dyestuff compositions constitute a further feature of the invention. The composition comprising the disperse dyestuff and the organic liquid may be applied to the aromatic polyester substrate by conventional dyeing or printing techniques, for example, by padding, or by roller or screen printing methods in the case of textile materials, and also by low add on techniques such as from a foam applicator or by a fine droplet spray on to the substrate1 or by a lick roll application. These latter methods are particularly useful for application to textile materials having an easily distortable construction. After impregnation, partial drying may be necessary by conventional means for example, infra red pre drying to remove excess water from the substrate, but complete drying is avoided so that a substantial proportion of the organic liquid remains on the substrate after pre drying. When the dyestuff and the organic liquid are applied by low liquor add on techniques to the substrate then little or no pre drying is required. The substrate, to which the disperse dyestuff composition has been applied, then passes through a radiofrequency or microwave field in which the presence of the organic liquid with its high loss factor causes efficient heating of the substrate to a temperature at which rapid diffusion of the dyestuff into the substrate occurs. The maximum temperature to which the substrate is heated is largely controlled by the rate of evaporation of the organic liquid i.e. its boiling point and by the fact that the aromatic polyester substrate is an inefficient absorber of the incident radiation. High levels of dyestuff fixation can be achieved witii this process, thus enabling the washing off operation or other subsequent scouring treatments to be omitted in some instances without significantly affecting the fastness properties of the coloured substrate. The process is particularly suitable for polyester because of the low absorption of radiofrequency or microwave radiation by the substrate, but the process is also applicable to blends of aromatic polyester with other fibres, for example, polyester wool, polyester cellulose and polyester cellulose triacetate. The preferred form of the polyester substrate used in the present process are piece, yarn and tow, but the process is not limited to these forms. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which percentages are by weight.Example 1 Texturised aromatic polyester fabric was padded at 110 liquor pick up through a dyebath containing 120 g l of a disperse dyestuff formulation comprising 12.5 dyestuff CI Disperse Blue 79.1 , 65 dipropylene glycol, 6.25 of an anionic dispersing agent and water to 100 . The padded fabric was subjected to radiofrequency radiation at 27.12MHz for a total dwell time of 5 minutes and an output current of 350 milliamperes. The fabric was coloured in a blue shade having good fastness properties.Example 2 Texturised aromatic polyester fabric was padded at 11CK liquor pick up through a dyebath containing 10 g l of a disperse dyestuff formulation comprising 18 dyestuff CI Disperse Violet 33 , 7.2A of an anionic dispersing agent, 25A propylene glycol and water to 10C . A further 200 g l of propylene glycol may be included in the padding liquor to improve fixation. The padded fabric was dried for approximately 3 minutes at 110 C to give about 20D moisture retention, and subsequently subjected to radiofrequency radiation at 27.12MHz for a total dwell time of 2 minutes and an output current of 350 milliamperes. The fabric was coloured in a violet shade having good fastness properties. Example 3 The procedure described in Example 1 is repe ted except that the dipropylene glycol is replaced by ethylene glycol. A similar result is obtained.
