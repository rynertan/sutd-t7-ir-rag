# Optical memory apparatus.

## Abstract
In an optical memory apparatus wherein predetermined information is optically recorded on a recording medium 10 along guide grooves 13 previously formed and then played back an optial memory apparatus wherein, using a tracking signal 52 and a signal 51 indicating the quantity of reflected light at the time at which a projected light beam passes through the guide groove 13 , the directions in which the light beam passes through the guide grooves and the number of the guide grooves to be passed are detected, a seek control is performed by adding and substracting the numbers of the guide grooves to be passed, depending upon the directions of pas sage, and fine positioning is thereafter performed by the use of the tracking signal 52 .
