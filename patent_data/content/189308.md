# Directly printable tape with novel release coating.

## Abstract
This invention relates to directly printable tapes, inks for printing upon said tapes, and a method for printing upon said tapes. Adhesive tapes with printing indicia on the back side, i.e., the side opposite that bearing adhesive are useful for advertising and identification functions. As a practical mat ter, the adhesive is generally a pressure sensitive adhesive. Inasmuch as pressure sensitive adhesive tapes are those in which the adhesive has sufficient adhesion and tack to adhere to adherend surfaces with light finger pressure, the tapes are generally coated on the back side with a release agent. Such a coating permits the tape to be unwound easily in roll form without transfer of the adhesive to the back side of the tape. Thus, with printable pressure sensitive adhesive tapes, the ink must adhere to the release coating, which is often called a ,,backsize , and not be removed by the adhe sive in contact therewith. This invention involves a directly printable tape com prising a polymeric film backing having a low adhesion back size coating on one major surface thereof and a pressure sensitive adhesive on the other major surface thereof. The low adhesion backsize coating comprises a mixture of a low adhesion backsize compound and an ink adhesion promoter. The disclosure further involves a method of printing on the low adhesion backsize coating and an ink composition. The ink comprises a conventional flexographic ink composition containing and ink adhesion promoter.
