## Description
VERTICAL SYNCHRONISATION PULSE SEPARATOR FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to digital pulse separator for separating pulses of a predetermined logic value from a composite signal and relates particularly but not exclusively to a vertical synchronisation pulse separator for separating field synchronisation pulses from a composite synchronisation signal in a television signal. BACKGROUND ART As is well known, television signals are transmitted as separate lines of information, a complete picture, containing 625 or 525 lines depending upon the particular television standard. Each line which is transmitted contains a line synchronisation pulse together with analogue video information. At the end of every field in which a vertical scan of the picutre is made, field synchronisation is effected usually by means of a group of five longer field synchronisation pulses. In order for satisfactory operation of a television receiver the field and line synchronisation pulses need to be separated from one another, This is accomplished firstly by removing the video information from the received signal to provide a composite synchronisation signal containing both line and field synchronisation pulses. The composite synchronisation signal has formerly been applied to an integrator T he integrator does not respond significantly to the line syncrcnisation pulses hich are singular and relatively short, but during the d field synchronistion period the output of the integrator rises significantly in response to the five longer pulses.Detection of the field synchronisation pulses is affirmed when the output level of the integrator has risen above a predetermined voltage level. A problem with this known sync separation method is that an integrating capacitor is required. This does not easily facilitate forming the sync separator circuit as part of a monolithic integrated circuit since the capacitor would need to be an off chip component. The present invention seeks to provide a verticl sync separator which is suitable for manufacturing as part of an integrated circuit and in which the above mentioned disadvantage is mitigated BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a digital pulse separator for separating pulses of a predetermined logic value from a composite signal the circuit comprising a counter responsive to the composite signal and means responsive to the state of the counter for indicating the reception of the said pulses when the count of the counter exceeds a predetermined value. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a vertical synchronisation pluse separator comprises a counter responsive to synchronisation pulses present in a composite synchronisation input signal and means responsive to the state of the counter for indicating the reception of field synchronisation pulses when the count of the counter exceeds a predetermThed value. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompany single figure drawing which illustrates schematically a preferred embodiment of a vertical sync separator in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPION OF THE INVENTION Referring to the Drawing, an up down counter 1 is clocked at a rate of 1MHz by means of a clock signal applied at a terminal 2 and counts either up or down in dependence upon the logical state of a composite synchronisation signal applied to the input terminal 3 of the counter. The state of the counter is sampled by a decoder4 which has an output connected to output terminal 5. When the terminal 3 is at a logical 0 state the counter is clocked up by the clock signal applied to the terminal 3 whilst when the terminal 3 is at a logical 1 level the counter counts down. The counter stops counting when its count reaches either an all 1 or an all O state but recommences counting when the input at the terminal 3 changes state. The count of the counter is sampled and decoded by the decoder 4 and when the count exceeds a predetermined value a logical 1 appears at the output 5 of the circuit. The decoder is typically implemented by gates which gate together the outputs of the counter to provide a logic 1 output for any predetermined set of outputs of the counter. When a synchronisation pulse, which may be either a short line synchronisation pulse or a longer field synchronisation pulse, appears at the terminal 3 the logical level at that terminal will go low and the counter 1 will start to count up. During each line synchronisation pulse the counter 1 will only count up to a relatively low value eg four, before the end of the sync pulse at which time the logical level at the terminal 3 will change and the counter will commence counting down.During the long field synchronisation pulses the counter will count up to a much higher value, for example 40 before it is reversed. The stages of the counter are monitored by the decoder 4 and when the decoded count exceeds a predetermined value typically a count of 12, a logical 1 output appears at the output terminal 5 indicating the reception of a field synchronisation pulse. Although the invention is particularly applicable to a television receiver it is equally applicable to a video recorder. The invention is particularly applicable to fabrication as an integrated circuit as part of a single chip television signal processing system. Also the invention may be used to separate digital signals of a predetermined logic value from a composite signal including logic l s and O s or from a signal which may include noise. The invention is applicable for use in a data slicer for a teletext receiver.
