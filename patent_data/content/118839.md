# METHOD OF MAKING A BEARING

## Abstract
The method of making a non metallic bearing assembly by initially molding a flat longitudinally extending sheet of rubber containing a ply or plies of fiberglass reinforced fabric therein, thence cutting such sheet into a plurality of strips. The flat strips are then located around the periphery of a mandrel that is then wound with fabric which is impregnated with epoxy resin, thence cured and machined to a cylindrical bearing.
