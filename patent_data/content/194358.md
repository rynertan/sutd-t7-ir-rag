Therefore, special interest has been attracted toward cubic system boron nitride as the material for a working tool.

On the other side, Slack predicted in J. Phys. Chem.Solids, Vol. 34 1972 page 321 that pure single crystal cBN would have heat conductivity as high as approximately 13 W cm. C at room temperature and suggested the possibility of using it as the material of a radiation substrate. However, large sized cBN single crystal has not been obtained yet and accordingly, the heat conductivity of 13 W cm C has not been confirmed. In addition, the largest value reported up to the present as the heat conductivity of a cBN sintered body containing a binding phase is only 2 W cm C. The reason for this is supposed to be that the binding phase acts as an important factor of phonon scattering, causing the heat conductivity to be lowered excessively. Furthermore, as a method for manufacturing a high heat conductivity cBN sintered body not containing a binding phase, U.S. Patent No. 4,188,194 issued onFebruary 12, 1980 for example discloses a method in which a high density cBN sintered body having high heat conductivity is manufactured by a direct conversion process using pyrolysis type boron nitride pBN as the starting raw material. However, in the method of the U.S. Patent No.4,188,194, very high pressure and high temperature conditions of 7GPa and 20000C or more respectively are required to manufacture a sintered body having heat conductivity of 4 W cm0C or more and there is also a problem in reproducibility. In addition, pBN is a very expensive material. On the other hand, a method for manufacturing a cBN sintered body not containing a binding phase under relatively mild conditions and at low cost is disclosed for example in the paper by Wakatsuki et al. in Mat. Res. Bull, Vol. 7 1972 page 999, in which a cBN sintered body is obtained by a direct conversion process using hexagonal system boron nitride of low degree of crystallization. However, the hBN of low degree of crystallization used as the starting raw material lacks chemical stability and is liable to react with the oxygen in the air, which makes it difficult to obtain a homogenous body uniformly and sufficiently sintered overall. The inventors of the present application conducted experiments on synthetic materials using various methods in order to manufacture a sintered body of high heat conductivity at low cost and with good reproductivity. As a result, they found it most suitable to use methods as disclosed in USP 4,469,802 issued toEndo et al on September 4, 1984 where boron nitride of an alkaline earth metal or alkali metal is mixed or diffused and held in hBN and then the material is subjected to a high temperature of 13500C or above under a thermodynamically stabilized pressure condition of cBN.Although the method in this prior art intends primarily to provide a sintered body having good light transmitting property, not to provide a sintered body having good heat conductivity, a part or all of the added boro nitride is diffused and removed out of the system in the above stated method at the time of sintering under a high pressure and in consequence, a sintered body comprised of substantially 100 cBN can be easily obtained. As a result of measuring the heat conductivity of a sintered body obtained as described above, it was made clear that the heat conductivity of such a sintered body was a relatively high value of 2 to 3 W cm C on the average compared with other sintered bodies using binding materials. However, it was also made clear that the heat conductivity of such a sintered body was in some cases as low as 1.7 W cm C and thus the measured values were scattered in a rather wide range.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a sintered body of cBN having good heat conductivity which can be manufactured stably at low cost. The inventors of the present application conducted many experiments under various conditions and as a result, they discovered that the heat conductivity of a sintered body depends not on the conditions of sintering but considerably on the composition of the material before it undergoes the sintering treatment, that is, the amount of addition of alkaline earth metal or alkali metal boron nitride to hBN. In addition, it wa also made clear that it is necessary to control the amount of addition of alkaline earth metal or alkali metal boron nitride within a range of from 0.6 mol to 1.2 mol . Accordingly, the present invention intends to provide a sintered body of high heat conductivity comprised of substantially 100 cubic system boron nitride and a method of manufacturing thereof, the above described sintered body of high heat conductivity being obtained by uniformly diffusing boron nitride of an alkaline earth metal or alkali metal in an amount of from 0.6 to 1.2 mol into hexagonal system boron nitride and then sintering the material at a temperature of 13500C and above under a high pressure under a thermodynamically stabilized condition of the cubic system boron nitride.

First, an amount of adding Mg3B2N4 was added to the hBN with the temperature condition being changed and thus, a relation as shown in Fig. 1 was established between the treatment temperature and the added amount to Mg3B2N4. Then, based on the result shown in Fig. 1, several materials containing different amounts of addition ofMg3B2N4 were prepared and were subjected respectively to a treatment under prescribed temperature and pressure conditions, whereby sintered bodies were obtained respectively. The heat conductivity of each of the thus obtained sintered bodies was measured and a relation thereof with the added amount of Mg3B2N4 to the material was examined. Fig. 2 shows the results. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that in the case of the added amount of Mg3B2N4 less than approximately 0.8 mol , the heat conductivity becomes high according to the increase of the added amount of Mg3B2N4. This is suppose to be due to the fact that as the added amount of Mg3B2N4 increase, the unit particle diameter of cBN becomes large to decrease phonon scattering in the particle boundary, which results in the heat conductivity being high. Fig. 3 shows a relation between the added amount of Mg3B2N4 and an average unit particle diameter of an obtained sintered body. From Fig. 3, it can be understood that the particle diameter becomes large according to the increase of the added amount of Mg3 B 2N4. However, from Fig. 2, it can be seen that the heat conductivity has the maximum value 6.2 W cm C with the added amount of Mg3B2N4 being about 0.9 mol and it is lowered reversely with the added amount of Mg3B2 N4 being more than 0.9 mol . If Mg3B2N4 is added in an amount of more than 0.9 mol , the obtained sintered body contains Mg or more than 0.5 by weight. This remainingMg is considered to act as a determing cause of phonon scattering, causing the heat conductivity to be lowered. Fig. 4 shows a relation between the heat conductivity of the respective sintered bodies synthesized with the added amount of Mg3BçN4 being changed and the Vickers hardness thereof. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that a sintered body having heat conductivity in a rage from 2 to 3 W cm C has hardness partially lowered and the sintered state thereof is not uniform. It is supposed that in the portion where the sintered state is not good, that is, in the portion where the hardness is lowered, phonon scattering in the particle boundary develops conspicuously on account of insufficient bonding of particles and as a result, the sintered body as a whole has a relatively low value of heat conductivity.On the other hand, a sintered body having uniform hardness of 5000 kg mm2 or more possesses heat conductivity 4 W cm C or above. From the relation between the added amount of Mg N and the heat conductivity shown in Fig. 2, it is understood that a sintered body having high heat conductivity of 4 W cm C or above can be stably obtained with the added amount ofMg3B2N4 being in a range from 0.6 mol to 1.2 mol . Furthermore, the inventors of the present application also discovered that in a cBN sintered body, a the volume ratio of the cubic system boron nitride in the sintered body, b the lattice constant of the boron nitride in the sintered body and c the proportion of substantial continuity with the adjoining particle of the cubic system boron nitride particle surface contribute to the heat conductivity. More specifically, as a result of measuring heat conductivity with the volume ratio of the cubic system boron nitride in a sintered body being changed from 60 to 100 , it was found that the heat conductivity of a sintered body having a volume ratio of 95 or more becomes remarkably high and any sintered body having a volume ratio of 98 or more has heat conductivity of 4 W cm OC of above. Accordingly, the volume ratio of the CBN in the CBN sintered body is preferably 98 or more. In addition, the sintering conditions were selected so that the lattice constant of the cubic system boron nitride may be changed from 3.608 to 3.630 , and under those conditions, the heat conductivity was measured. As the result, the maximum value of the heat conductivity was exhibited in the vicinity of 3.615 A and high values of heat conductivity of 4.0 W cm C and above were shown in a range from 3.610 to 3.625 . Accordingly, the lattice constant of the cBN in the cBN sintered body is preferable in a range from 3.610 to 3.625 , This is because a deviation from the stoichiometrical BN would increase lattice defects to cause phonon scattering. In such case, if the amount of nitrogen is small, the lattice constant would be increased. The inventors of the present application manufactured sintered bodies with the sintered conditions being changed and the binding state of the cubic system boron nitride particle was observed by wrapping the sintered bodies thus obtained Then, the heat conductivity values of those sintered bodies were measured and it was made clear that a sintered body having substantial continuity of 60 or more with the adjoining particles has a high value of heat conductivity of 4.0 W cmzOC or above. The reason for this is considered to be that the influence of phonon scattering in the particle boundary contributes to the heat conductivity. According to the present invention, a cBN sintered body obtained as described above exhibits heat conductivity as high as 4.0 W cm C and above and consequently, it becomes possible to provide a heat sink of an excellent quality for use in an electronic device. A sintered body having heat conductivity of 4 W cm0C or above has a particle diameter of 5 XLm or more, aVickers hardness of 5000 kg mm2 or more and a content ofMg of 0.5 by weight or less. This means that from the hardness and the impurity content, to the contrary, the heat conductivity of the sintered body can be known. Embodiments Example 1 As raw materials were used hBN bodies obtained by forming hBN powder with hot press method or CIP cold isostatic pressurizing . The hBN bodies obtained were held in N2gas at 2000 21000C for 4 hours to highly purify them. Impurities containted in the hBN bodies were not more than 0.05 by weight of 02, not more than 0.02 by weight of carbon and not more than 200 ppm of metal imprurities such as Fe, Ca or the like, and the density of the hBN bodies were in a range of 1.75 1.85 g cm3. Under the normal pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere at various temperature in a range from 1160 to 11750C, Mg3N2 was diffused and contained in the hBN of high purity described above and eight specimens having different amounts of Mg3B2N4 in a range from 0.4 to 1.3 mol were obtained as a result of reaction in the hBN body. These specimens were respectively put in recipients an subjected to the conditions of 5.5 GPa and 1450 C for 30 minutes using a belt type device. The obtained sintered bodies were monophase high density sintered bodies each having a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm. In the sintered body of specimen 1, the hBN not converted were remaining paritially, while the other specimens appeared to be in a homogenously and strongly sintered state over the whole surface. In consequence, it is understood that for 100 conversion to cBN, the amount of Mg3B2N4 added to the raw material hBN body is required to be approximately 0.45 mol or more. From the sintered bodies of speciments 2 to 8, pieces of 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 mm were extracted respectively and the heat conductivity of each piece was measured at room temperature by a direct measuring method using an InSb infrared radiation microscope.

The particle diameter was measured by a scanning type electronic microscope SEM after the surface of each specimen was etched with KOH to make clear the particle boundaries. The hardness was examined by using a Vicker s penetrator under the load of 10 kg for 15 seconds. The content of impurity, that is the content of Mg was measured by using an ion microanalyzer.

From. the example 1 and the results shown in Table 3, it is understood that a sintered body having heat conductivity of 4W cm C or above has a unit particle diameter of 5 4m or more, Vickers hardness of 5000 kg mm2 or more and the Mg content of 0.5 by weight or less.Example 3 Instead of the Mg3B2N4 in the example 1, Li3BN2, Ca3B2N4 and Sr3 B 2N4 were respectively diffused and contained in an amount of from 0.6 to 1.2 mol in the hBN and sintered bodies were obtained in the same manner as in the example 1. In all of the sintered bodies thus obtained, the heat conductivity was 4W cm C or above and the particle diameter, the hardness and the impurity contend were almost the same as the results of the example 2.Example 4 hBN bodies containing 0.8 0,9 mol of Mg3B2N4 were obtained in the same manner as in the Example 1.After that , the body was put in a recipient and using a belt type device, six sintered bodies were formed under the conditions of 55 kw and 1400 C, with the holding time being changed. The proportions of transformation to cubic system boron nitride in the obtained sintered bodies were respectively 60 , 80 , 90 , 95 , 98 and 100 . The remaining portions were compounds of the hexagonal system boron nitride not transformed and the catalyst. The heat conductivity of each of the above stated sintered bodies was measured and the results are shown inTable 4 below. From Table 4, it is understood that a sintered body having a volume ratio of cubic system boron nitride of 98 or more has heat conductivity as high as 4.0 W cm. C or above.

Then, it was subjected to treatment under the conditions of 57 kb and 14500C with the temperature being raised by two steps and sintered bodies were obtained. By changing the holding time in the first step, the lattice constants of the cubic system boron nitride of the sintered bodies were made different. Table 5 shows the results of measurement of the heat conductivity values of the these sintered bodies. From Table 5, it is understood that a high value of heat condudtivity of 4.0 W cm C or above was exhibited with the lattice constant of the cubic system boron nitride being in a range from 3.610 to 3.625 .

The sintered bodies thus obtained were wrapped with fine power of diamond and then, particle boundary was checked by using a scanning type electronic microscope. As a result, it was ascertained that the hexagonal system boron nitride particles were substantially continuous with the surrounding adjacent particles and no particle boundary was observed. In addition, a relation between an average value of the surface proportion of continuity and the heat conductivity was examined and the result is shown inTable 6 below.

However, such coating film has disadvantages that the adhesion to the cubic system boron nitride sintered body is insufficient and accordingly, they are liable to be detached at the time of inserting the heat sink in a cooper substrate.By contrast, in a heat sink using a CBN sintered body of the present invention, the above stated disadvantages have been dissolved and coating films having an excellent adhesion property can be provided. More specifically, a sintered body of the present invention may be provided with on its surface, coating layers of one or more transition metals of the groups IVa, Va and VIa of the periodic table or the alloys thereof. In this case, boride, nitride or boron nitride of such metals is formed in the interface, which makes it possible to remarkable increase the adhesion intensity of the coating films. In addition, in the present invention, one or more coating layers of metals not oxidized at a temperature of 3000C or alloys thereof may be provided for purpose of preventing oxidation of the metal of the coating films.As the metals not oxidized at a temperature of 3000C, Au,Ag, Cu, Pt, Al, Ni, Co and the like are preferred. The temperature of 3000C is based on the fact that the maximum temperature necessary for adhesion between a semiconductor device and lead wires, between the semiconductor device and the sink, and between the heat sink and the substrate is approximately 3000C. Example 7 The sintered body of specimen 4 in the example 5 was cut into 20 pieces each having a size of 1 mm2 and 0.4 mm thickness. After that, those pieces were heated to a high temperature and Ti was coated to a thickness of 500 A on the surface of each piece. Subsequently, was further coated to a thickness of lm m on the Ti coating layer. Then, a semiconductor laser device was soldered on each sintered body thus formed and leads were connected. For comparison, a BeO body was cut into 20 pieces each having the same size as described above and in the same manner, coating was applied and semiconductor laser devices of the same kind were placed. When electric current of 150 mA was made to flow, the surface temperature of each device was measured. As a result, it was observed that the temperature of the devices each provided with a heat sink comprising a cubic system boron nitride sintered body in accordance with the present invention was lowered by approximately 150C. In addition, in a scratching test using a sapphire needle, some of the coating films of the heat sinks of BeO were detached, while the coating films on the sintered bodies, in accordance with the present invention were not detached. Furthermore, the face of contact between cBN sintered body and a coating film was examined by a TEM and there was found titanium borid.Example 8 The sintered body of specimen 5 in the example 5 was cut into four pieces each having a size of 100 mm2 and 0,5 mm in thickness. Then, those pieces were heated andCr was coated on the surface of each piece and Ni and Ag were further coated thereon. Each of the sintered bodies containing the coating films thus formed was attached to an IC substrate. As a result, it was observed that the IC operated more stably and the lifetime of the IC became remarkably long. Now, in the following, a concrete structure of a heat sink for an IC using a sintered body in accordance with the present invention will be described. In the below described case, for the purpose of improving the heat radiation property, a sintered body is shaped such that the area of the outer surface of the sintered body may be relatively larger than the surface thereof facing the semiconductor device. For the shaping, the following three manners are considered. a The surface area of the heat sink on the side of an envelope is made larger than the area of the portion of the heat sink contacting the IC device so that the heat content per unit area is lowered on the side of the envelope. Thus, the temperature of the heat sink material can be made close to the temperature of the external atmosphere and accordingly, the temperature of the IC device can be lowered effectively. b the surface area of the heat sink in the portion contacting the external gas or liquid is made large so that the heat conduction to the exterior is improved. c Radiation fins are provided in the portion of the heat sink contacting the external gas or liquid so that the heat radiation property is further improved. The above described heat sink uses a cBN sintered body having excellent heat conductivity and is shaped such that the area of the outer surface thereof is relatively large compared with the surface thereof on the side facing the semiconductor device and in consequence, heat can be emitted efficiently from the inside of the device to the exterior not only because of the good heat conductivity of the material itself but also because of its structure. Figs. 5A and 5B are respectively plane and side sectional views of the first example of a heat sink in accordance with the present invention. Referring to Figs. 5A and 5B, a Si device or a compound semiconductor 2 as anIC devie is disposed in an envelope 1 and input and output pins 4 are provided through leads 3 connected to the Si device 2. On the other hand, in the envelope 1 on the side of the Si device 2, a tapered opening is formed, the diameter thereof being small on the inner side and being increased toward the outer surface of the envelope 1. In the opening, a heat sink 5 for IC device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is placed. As is clear from Fig. 5B, the heat sink 5 has a form corresponding to the tapered opening and accordingly the surface area thereof on the side of the Si device 2 as the semiconductor device is small and the surface of area thereof on the outer side of the envelope 1, that is on the side contacting the external atmosphere is increased. Thusr as described previously, the heat content per unit area of the heat sink is smaller on the outer side than on the side of the Si device 2 and radiation of heat can be made more efficiently. Figs. 6A and 6B are respectively plane and side sectional views of an IC device where the second example of a heat sink in accordance with the present invention is applied In this example, the envelope 1 and the heat sink 5 are formed in the direction in which the input and output pins 4 extend. The other portions are the same as in the example shown in Figs. 5A and 5B. Accordingly, it is understood that heat is radiated efficiently also in the heat sink 5 of this example. Figs 7A and 7B are respectively plane and side sectional views of an IC device where the third example of a heat sink in accordance with the the present invention is applied. In this third example, a through hole not tapered is formed in the envelope and the heat sink 5 for IC is placed in the through hole. However, the heat sink 5 in this example extends on the outer side of the envelope 1 over a range wider than the diameter of the through hole. More specifically, the heat sink 5 is provided over an area larger than the opening area so as to be in contact with the outer surface of the envelope 1. Accordingly, also in this example, in the same manner as in the example shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, the surface area of the heat sink 5 on the external side is made larger than that on the side of the Si device 2 and the same radiation effect can be obtained. Figs. 8A and 8B are respectively plane and side sectional views of a device where the fourth example of a heat sink in accordance with the present invention is applied. In this fourth example, in the same manner as in the heat sink 5 of the example shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, the envelope 1 and the heat sink 5 for IC are provided in the direction in which the input and output pins 4 extend. The structure of the envelope 1 and heat sink 5 are the same as those in the third example shown in Figs. 7A and 7B and therefore, the same effect can be obtained. Figs. 9A and 9B are plane and side sectional views of a device where the fifth example of a heat sink in accordance with the present invention is applied. In this fifth example, radiation fins 6 are formed on the external side of the heat sink 5. The other portions are the same as in the example shown in Figs. 7A and 7B. It is understood that the example shown in Figs. 9A and 9B has more excellent radiation characteristic compared with the third example since the radiation fins 6 are provided in this fifth example The form of the radiation fins 6 is not limited to that shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, They may have any suitable form as shown in the sixth to eighth examples in Figs.1OA 1OB, llA llB and 12A 12B. In any of the forms, the area of the fins 6 can be made larger than the outer surface area of the heat sink 5 and accordingly, the heat radiation characteristic can be further improved. Now, an example of a method of manufacturing a heat sink for IC in accordance with the present invention will be described with reference to the partial from sectional views of Fig 13. As shown in Fig. 13, in a girdle type extra high pressure generating apparatus, cBN bodies 11 containing diffused mangnesium boron nitride are disposed respectively between the ultra hard alloy plates 12 and the Mo plates 13 of 0.1 mm in thickness shaped according to the form of the radiation fins so that a multilayer structure is formed. The thus formed multilayer structure is placed in a recipient 14 of Mo. Then, under the pressure of 55 kb, the Mo recipient 14 is heated at a temperature of 1450 C for 30 minutes. After that, the sintered bodies 11 are taken out from the Mo recipient 14.In advance, the respective surfaces of the Mo plates 13 disposed between the respective sintered bodies 11 have been coated with a peeling agent so that the multi layer sintered bodies 11 may be easily separated from one another. Therefore, the sintered bodies 11 thus taken out are separated with the Mo plates 13 being attached thereto. The Mo plate 13 attached to the surface of each sintered body 11 is removed for example by treatment using acid such as nitric acid, whereby the same form as that of the radiation fins 6 of the heat sink 5 in the example shown in Figs. 12A and 12B can be obtained. On the face portion of contact between the thus obtained sintered body 11 and the IC device, a multilayer coating film of Ti and Ni and Au is formed and this coating film is soldered by Au Sn to the IC logic device, so that the structure thus formed is fixed to the envelope. Thus, the IC device shown in Figs. 12A and 12B can be obtained. For comparison, an IC device as shown inFigs 12A and 12B was manufactured using a heat sink of BeO and the performances of the heat sinks of both IC devices were tested. In this test, the same electric power and the same electric current were applied and the temperatures on the surface of the envelopes of both IC devices were measured. As a result, it was ascertained that the device using the heat sink of the present invention had a lower temperature and exhibited a more excellent characteristic when it was operated. Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.
