# Lifting harness for lifting a load of two or more objects.

## Abstract
A lifting harness for lifting of a load comprising two or more essentially cylindrical objects 1 , e.g. rolls of paper, which are in an upright position. The lifting harness is formed by two lifting slings 3 , the ends of which are fashioned into eyes 4 , and two endless lifting loops 5 , each of which is joined to a different one of the lifting slings 3 and threaded through the eyes 4 of the other lifting sling 3 . The lifting slings 3 are applied around the load 1 from opposite sides so that the lifting loops 5 extend above the load and this section of the lifting loops is attached to a lifting hook 2 . On lifting, the lifting slings 3 are tightened around the load. Such a harness simplifies the loading and unloading of the load onto and off a vessel. The side of the lifting slings that will face towards the load may be fitted with a friction increasing covering or treated with a friction increasing material.
