# A rock drilling rig.

## Abstract
In a rock drilling rig for tunnel driving the boom or booms 41, 42 that carry the rock drills 55, 56 are pivotably mounted on rotatable discs 32. The discs 32 are parts of mountings 29, 30 that are mounted on support plates 21, 22 . The support plates 21, 22 are pivotable so that the centre axes 45, 46 of the discs 32 can be swung along part circular paths. The rig permits driving of larger tunnel areas than prior art rigs of comparable size and cost.

## Description
A rock drilling rigThis invention relates to a rock drilling rig for tunnel driving.It is an object of the invention to provide a rock drilling rig by which larger tunnel areas can be drilled than can be drilled by means of prior art rigs of comparable size and costs.The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a side view of a drilling rig according to the invention.Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the rig shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 3 is a front view seen as indicated by arrows 3 3 in Fig. 1, but two rock drill boom structures that are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are not shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 4 is a section taken along line 4 4 in Fig. 1.Fig. 5 is a section taken along line 5 5 in Fig. 4.Fig. 6 shows an alternative central mounting arrangement for a rock drill boom structure.In Figs 1 3, a rock drilling rig for tunnel driving is shown. It comprises a chassis 11 on wheels 12. The chassis 11 carries a console 13 with an operator s panel, a bracket 14, and two removable power units 15,16. Two support units 17,18 are screwed to the bracket 14 and they comprise pivots 19,20 on which two rigid support plates 21,22 are pivot ably mounted. The axes 23,24 of the pivots 19,20 are horizontal and extend in the longitudinal direction of the chassis 11 and of the tunnel being driven. Two double acting hydraulic cylinders 25,26 are coupled to swing the support plates 21,22 about the axes 23,24.Two rock drill boom structures 27,28 are mounted on the support plates 21,22. They comprise mountings 29,30. Each one of these mountings 29,30 comprises a housing 31 in which a disc 32 is rotatably supported at its periphery by four supports 33 36, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The disc 32 can be turned in both directions by means of a double acting hydraulic cylinder 37 and a hydraulically controlled gripping unit 38, and it can be firmly arrested in its position by means of clamping bolts 73 that are carried by the supports 33 36. The clamping bolts 73 are biassed by springs 74 Fig. 5 to clamp the disc 32 axially against the supports 33 36 and they can be hydraulically released. The gripping unit 38 comprises four hydraulically activated gripper pistons 75 that grip when subject to hydraulic pressure.The clamping bolts 73, the gripper pistons 75 and the hydraulic cylinder 37 are coupled in parallel to a common control valve as described in Applicant s European patent publicationNo. 0 003 006 which is incorporated herein by way of reference and which describes a mounting of this kind in more detail. The discs 32 carry two pairs of lugs 39,40 on which two booms 41,42 are pivotably mounted to pivot about pivots that form axes 43,44 that are perpendicular to the axes 45,46 of the discs 31. The rotation axes 45,46 of the discs 32, i.et the control axes of the discs, are perpendicular to the axes 23,24 of the pivots 19,20. The booms 41,42 are swingable about the axes 43,44 by means of hydraulic cylinders 47,48 that are pivotably coupled between lugs 49,50 on the discs 32 and supports 51,52 on the booms 41,42.Feed beams 53,54 for rock drills, e.g. hydraulic, percussive rock drills 55,56, are axially slidably mounted in holders 76,77 and the holders 76,77 are pivotably mounted on pivots 57,58 on the outer ends of the booms 41,42. The holders 76,77 and thereby the feed beams 53,54 are pivotable about the axes of the pivots 57,58 by means of hydraulic cylinders 59,60.mounted on the pivots 57,58. Then the feed beams 53,54 are axially slidably mounted in the holders 76,77. The feed beams 53,54 and the holders are are not illustrated in detail, but reference is made to Applicant s German patent publication DEOS 28 20325 which describes the feed beams and which is incorporated herein by way of reference. Bundles 70,71 of hydraulic power lines for the feed beams 53,54 and for the rock drills 55,56 extend from the power units 15,16 through apertures 72 in the discs 32.In Fig. 3 the rig is shown without the boom structures, and a possible tunnel profile is shown by lines 61 and the largest possible area tp be drilled is shown by dotted lines 62.When drilling the tunnel face, the operator preferably starts with the support plates 21,22 in their illustrated vertical positions, and drills most of the holes without swinging the support plates. Instead, he swings the booms 40,41 about the axes 43,44 and he rotates the discs 32 about the axes 45,46. Then he rotates the discs 32 until the axes 43,44 are horizontal. The operator proceeds now by indexing the support plates 21,22 about the axes 23,24 instead of turning the discs 31 in order to reach the places for the contour holes. The axes 45,46 of the discs 32 and the circular line about which the axes 45,46 move are indicated in Fig. 3. The support plates 21,22 can be swung through 110 degrees by means of the hydraulic cylinder 25,26. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the support plates.21,22 can be swung into positions in which they extend obliquely downwardly outwardly. They can aIso be swung past their vertical positions so that they are directed somewhat inwardly in order to reduce the overall width of the rig during transport.
