# Variable displacement pump system.

## Abstract
A variable displacement, axial piston pump has workports 10 and 12 and a swashplate 14 controlled by two pis ton actuators 16, 18 for selecting the displacement, and pumping direction of the pump. Control is effected by way of a control valve 24 with a manually positionable spool 26 and a sleeve 28 connected to a follow up linkage 30 from the swashplate. The outputs 40, 42 of this valve are connected to the piston actuators 16, 18 by way of an override valve 50 which normally assumes the illustrated position under the action of a bias spring 66 . Whichever port 10, 12 is the high pressure port is connected by a shuttle valve 36 not only to the control valve 24 but also to a pilot 68 for shifting the override valve 50 to its alternative position in which the work ports 10, 12 are connected to the piston acutators 16, 18 to drive the swashplate rapidly back towards neutral, should the pump pressure become too high.
