# A device for supplying a pair of wires to a rotating wire guide in a coil winding machine.

## Abstract
A device for supplying two separate wires 11, 18 to a wire guide 1 in a coil winding machine of the kind compris ing a stationary coil support, a rotating wire guide 1 and two spools 7, 16 for supplying said wires 11, 18 . A first statio nary spool 7 is mounted on a support 7A, 7B at least partly disposed coaxially to the wire guide axis and the first wire 11 unwound therefrom is guided along said axis, means being provided for guiding the second wire 18 unwound from the second spool 16 , disposed upstream of the first spool 7 along a path which runs astride of the first spool and is rotated around it in time with the rotation of the wire guide 1 .
