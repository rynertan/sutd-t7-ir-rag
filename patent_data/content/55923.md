# Assay for creatine kinase isoenzymes.

## Abstract
Two forms of creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme CK in animal tissue indicate damage to skeletal muscle MM form or cardiac damage MB form . The invention provides a simpler and cheaper assay than used previously, arising from the discovery that certain metal ions inhibit MB form while inhibiting MM form less or even activating it. For human serum aluminium ions are preferred. From CK activity without the selective ion inhibitor total CK MB MM form can be determined and a comparison of CK activity in the presence and absence of the selective ion inhibitor yields MB form activity. Creatine phosphate and ADP are normally added to determine CK activity.

## Description
ASSAY FOR CREATINE KINASE ISOENZYMES is is invention relates to an assay for determination of creatine kinase CK isoenzymes. Creatine kinase CK , or creatine phosphokinase as it is more properly termed, is an enzyme which catalyses the transfer of phosphate from ATP to creatine, being associated with various animal tissues. In mammals CK exists as three different isoenzymes, each associated with a particular type of tissue in the body the MM form alternatively known as CK 3 associated with skeletal muscle and other tissues, the BB form alternatively known as CK 1 mainly with brain tissue but also with stomach and intestinal tissue, and the MB hybrid form alternatively known as CK 2 with heart tissue. Each such form of enzyme is a dimer composed of M and or B sub units. In certain circumstances serum levels of CK isoenzymes become elevated, in particular when the associated tissues are damaged causing release of the corresponding isoenzymes, and increases in the serum concentrations of particular CK isoenzymes have been used to diagnose and confirm damage to the corresponding tissues. Thus a rise in the serum levels of the MM isoenzyme usually indicates damage to skeletal muscle. Increases in the serum levels of the MB isoenzyme confirm suspected cardiac damage after clinical observation of heart attack symptoms. Hereinafter the generic term creatine kinase isoenzyme is abbreviated to CK, the three forms thereof merely to MM, BB and MB, and the sub units thereof merely to M and B. At present two main methods are used to determine the serum levels of CK 1 a method which depends upon a slow laborious electrophoretic or chromatographic separation of the isoenzymes, and 2 a method which employs an antibody to MM as an inhibitor thereof. In this second method the CK activity of the serum is determined in the presence of the anti MM antibody inhibitor, the residual activity being that due to B. It is assumed that the BB isoenzyme will not be present in serum unless brain damage has occurred. Therefore MB is determined by doubling the value found for B activity. This method is disadvantageous because the MM antibody is difficult and costly to prepare. One commercial kit includes sodium azide, a dangerous reagent, as a storage preservative. The present invention provides a method for determination of the concentration of MB form or MM form CK isoenzymes present in a sample of animal tissue, especially human serum, in which the CK activity of the sample is determined in the absence as well as the presence of a concentration of a metal ion which selectively inhibits the activity of the MB form of the enzyme in preference to that of the MM form of the enzyme, and in which the CK activities of the sample in the absence and presence of the inhibiting metal ion are compared. Any metal ion which for tissue of a particular species of animal selectively inhibits the activity of MB in preference toMM can be used in the method of the invention at an inhibiting concentration and for assay of a sample taken from tissue of that species. The nost preferred metal ion for use in assay of human serum is aluminium it inhibits MB strongly while activating MM. The effect of introducing a metal ion varies according to the species of animal from which the tissue is derived. Nevertheless, tests on rabbit isoenzymes are considered to be a reaonsable general guide to performance on human serum. The following ions were tested on MM and BB isoenzymes isolated from rabbits divalent ions calcium, strontium, barium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, indium, tin and lead trivalent ions aluminium, scandium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, dysprosium, erbium and ytterbium. The ions which inhibited BB more strongly than MM were aluminium, ytterbium, iron, lanthanum, lead, iridium, dysprosium and erbium. Aluminium was the only ion to activate MM while inhibiting BB. Magnesium ions are a well known additive in CK assays and are used in order to complex the ATP and assist in expressing OK activity. They are not, of course, usable as the selective ions in the method of the invention, but are preferably added together with the aluminium or other selective ions. The following description refers to assay of samples of human serum using aluminium as the selective ions. The invention is, of course, applicable to other kinds of sample of human or non human animal tissue in which the presence of 3B is not expected and other selective ions are usable mutatis mutandis. The CK activity may be determined by any suitable method and means, including those previously used. Thus the CK activity may be determined by incubation of the sample together with a creatine substrate for a given period of time after which the extent of reaction is determined and the CK activity calculated. For example, the extent of the reaction EMI3.1 tb Creatine SEP CK SEP iso SEP enzyme tb SEP SEP ADP SEP SEP ATP SEP SEP Creatine tb phosphate tb can be monitored colorimetrically. Thus creatine can be determined using a diacetyl alpha naphthol reagent to produce a pink coloration, or phosphate determined by the phosphomolybdate method. In principle, the creatine creatine phosphate reaction may be monitored continuously.The well known hexokinase glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase method, which produces NADPH, the appearance of which may be monitored by optical density measurements, is not suitable without modification, at least in the preferred embodiment of this invention, since aluminium ion inhibits hexokinase. The concentration of the B present in the sample is estimated by comparison of the results obtained for CK activity in the presence and absence of the aluminium ions. The results obtained may be compared with results previously obtained from solutions having known concentrations of MM and MB. Preferably the conditions for assay of CK activity are chosen as hereinafter explained so that MB and therefore B activity is substantially completely inhibited and only M activity is measured in the presence of the aluminium ions. In this latter case the decrease in activity in the presence of the aluminium ions is a measure of the B of the MB, the residual activity being due to the M of the NB and MM. As in prior assays, it is assumed that the sample does not contain any BB unless brain damage has occurred. The aluminium cations can be used in association with any non interfering anions and can be added, for example, as the nitrate, chloride or sulphate. The selective effect of the aluminium ions depends upon their concentration in the final assay mixture the CK reaction mixture . In human serum samples, MB is inhibited significantly and the MM forum is activated at aluminium ion concentrations of above 2mM, especially above 2.5mM. At too high a concentration of aluminium ions, however, the MM form also becomes inhibited and a preferred upper limit is 5mM. Also, when the ADP concentra tion is relatively low to aluminium ion concentration, aluminium ions precipitate as the hydroxide. At lOmM ADP, the aluminium ion concentration is best not more than 4mM. then, as is preferred, the assay is carried out in the pfesence of magnesium ions, the concentration thereof should be suffitient to inhibit MB significantly at the chosen aluminium ion concentration. When both aluminium and magnesium concentrations are low, the nB is insufficiently inhibited, but at low aluminium concentration the MB can be inhibited if the magnesium ion concen traction is high enough. The range 6 to 15mM, preferably 8 to 15mM, of magnesium ion concentration in the final assay mixture is generally best. The pH of the CK reaction mixture before adding the aluminiun ions is normally from 7.0 to 7.5, preferably from 7.1 to 7.4. At too low a pH around 7.0 non enzyme catalysed reaction of creatine phosphate with ADP occurs to a significant extent. This means that blank assays performed for comparison have high background levels of CK activity, making changes in CK activity more difficult to detect. Inhibition of MB decreases with increasing pH at too high a pH around 7.5 the degree of inhibition of MB becomes too low. A pH of 7.2 to 7.4 is the most preferred range. High blank values are also obtained if the concentration of creatine phosphate CP in the assay mixture is excessive. It is preferred to keep it at less than 14mM. However, the CK enzyme has only limited affinity for the CP substrate, expressed by the Michaelis constant K . It is only 2mM for human MB but 3.5my for Th human MM. In order to use the assay method for human SI the lowest tolerable CP concentration in the CK reaction mixture final assay mixture is normally about 7mM and at least 8mM is preferred. To keep the creatine phosphate concentration fairly low and thereby avoid high blanks, it is preferable to keep the concentration of ADP in the final assay mixture a little higher, for example at lOmM if the CP concentration is 8mM. Too high an ADP concentration is uneconomic and might cause undesirably high inhibition of CK. Generally it will be in the range 8 to 12mM depending on the concentration of aluminium ions and other factors. The final assay mixture can contain other usual additives, for example a reagent for maintaining the creatine kinase isoenzyme in reduced form. A preferred such agent is a thiol group containing agent, e.g. glutathione. The assay can be carried out at any conventional temperature appropriate to expression of CK, preferably around 370C when the creatine phosphate ADP reaction is used to monitor CK. Reagents for use in the method of the invention can be supplied in the form of multi component kits. A kit can comprise 1 a substrate for CK, preferably creatine phosphate, and if necessary a co reagent for reaction of the CK substrate to be catalysed by the CK, for example ADP when the substrate is creatine phosphate, and 2 the selective ions, preferably aluminium ions when human serum is to be assayed. The first component preferably comprises magnesium ion, creatine phosphate and ADP and optionally other compatible additives, e.g. glutathione. Buffer can be provided separately for making up a solution of the first component.Preferably the kit includes an inhibitor of CK activity and a colour indicating agent. The colour indicating agent can comprise two or more reagents and preferably at least part of the colourindicating agent is present as a third, separate component. For example, the diacetyl alpha naphthol colour indicating agent can be used. The preferred kit then contains the alkaline alphanaphthol reagent and an inhibitor of total CK activity as a third component and diacetyl as a separate fourth component or as part of the first component. A suitable inhibitor of total CK activity is p hydroxymercuribenzoate which can be added in the form of p chloromercuribenzoate. The proportions of magnesium ions, creatine phosphate andADP in the preferred first component will conveniently be such that on addition of the aluminium ion component and after any necessary dilution, the final assay mixture contains the preferred proportions of the various reagents as set out above. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Example 1 The MB CK isoenzyme activity of human serum samples was determined as follows. 20 100 microlitres of serum were added to 2 ml of 0.1M Tris acetate buffer pH 7.4 containing 8mM MgCl2, 10mM creatine 0 phosphate, 3mM glutathione and 4mM ADP and incubated at 37 C for 20 minutes. At completion of incubation the CK reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 ml, 0.05M p chloromercuribenzoate pCMB , 1 ml alpha naphthol 20 mg ml in alkaline solution, 30 g NaOH, 80 g Na CO in 500 ml of water. The pCMB solution was made by dissolving the solid in sodium hydroxide and adding dilute hydrochloric acid until the pCMB is only just in solution.1 ml Diacetyl solution 0.05 w v and 6 ml distilled water were 0 then added to each tube. The tubes were incubated at 37 C for 20. minutes and the resultant pink solution was measured colorimetrically using a Unicam SP 600 spectrophotometer, reading the extinction at 520 nm. The above procedure was repeated for a sample of the same serum, but using 0.8 ml of 1OmM aluminium nitrate in the reaction mixture in place of 0.8 ml of water when making up the 2 ml of buffer solution. The concentration of aluminium ions in the react ion mixture was therefore about 4mM. Similarly the CK activity of the serum in the presence of the aluminium ions was determined. The two results obtained, one in the absence and the other in the presence of the aluminium ions, were compared, the difference between them indicating MB concentration in the serum. This method was used to determine the MB present in the serum of 10 human patients, some of whom had been independently diagnosed as having suffered heart damage. The results are tabulated below. Total CK was determined independently by a standard method and MB was determined by the method of the invention as percentage inhibition of total CK . The independently diagnosed condition for each patient is also reported.Patient Day MB Total CK Diagnosis wage inhibition gg l A 1 0 213 suspected myocardial infarction A 3 0 171 B 2 0 216 suspected myocardial infarction B 3 0 51 C 1 0 283 chest pains after cardiac catheter D 1 47 1610 D 2 23 687 myocardial infarction D 3 0 414 E 1 25 1055 query of myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolus F 1 27 224 dermatomyocitis Continued ContinuedPatient Day MB Total CK Diagnosis age inhibition pug 1 G 1 13 738 myocardial infarction H 1 0 223 cardiovascular accident I 1 46 1520 I 2 0 579 myocardial infarction I 3 0 172 J 1 0 315 pneumonia K 1 9 478 myocardial infarction The results obtained were in complete agreement with the clinical diagnosis. Patient F was diagnosed as suffering from dermatomyocitis for which elevated MB levels were expected. Example 2 A test kit for assay of human serum was prepared, having the following 3 separate components Solution A 10 ml of a 80mM solution of magnesium acetate in buffer total volume 10 ml of a 30mM solution of glutathione in buffer 55 ml 10 ml of a 100my solution of ADP in distilled water adjusted to pH 7.2 10 ml of a 80mM solution of phosphocreatine creatine phosphate in buffer 15 ml of additional buffer, which was a 0.1M aqueous solution of Tris acetate containing 0.1 w v bovine serum albumin.Solution B 6g NaOH 16g Sodium carbonate Na2CO3.1OH2O 2g Alpha naphthol 20 ml of a 0.05M solution of pCMB made up as in Example 1 Distilled water to make 100 ml. Solution C 0.007 w v Diacetyl in distilled water.The method of assay was as follows. Up to 100 microlitres of human plasma, diluted as necessary with 0.9 w v NaCl solution, was added to 1.1 ml of solution A, 0.8 ml of distilled water H20 or 0.8 ml, lOmM aluminium nitrate and the reaction mixture was incubated at 370C for 20 minutes. The concentrations of the various components in the reaction mixture were therefore approximately 4mM aluminium ions, 8mM magnesium ions, 10mM ADP, 8mM creatine phosphate and 3mM glutathione. The CK reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of solution B, and 7 ml of solution C. For colour development the mixture was incubated for 25 minutes 0 at 37 C, and the pink coloration determined at 520 nm as in Example 1. This method was used to determine MB as described in Example 1.Total CK was also determined from the activity of the sample in the absence of aluminium ions. A pH of 7.2 in the final assay mixture, before addition of aluminium ions, was used in Example 2.
