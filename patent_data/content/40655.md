# Method and means for automatically setting timepieces in a time zone.

## Abstract
A timepiece is set by transmission of a time related signal which is received by the timepiece and converted into digital form. The circuit developing signals represent ing the time displayed by the timepiece is stepped more rap idly than normal and simultaneously compared with the time related signal until they compare at which time the rapid stepping of the timepiece is abruptly terminated and normal stepping of the timepiece is resumed. The carrier may be any supersonic frequency. Setting of the timepiece may be enabled only after operating a time check switch. The above technique may be employed to produce an alarm at a requested time to serve as a memory or wake up aid, for example.

## Description
METHOD AND MEANS FOR AUTOMATICALLY SETTING TIMEPIECES IN A TIME ZONE BACKGROUND OF HE INVENTION International and even national travellers frequently cross from one time zone into another as a routine part of their travel. It thus becomes important for a person to remember to change a watch setting to conform to the new zone. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ThE INVENTION The present invention is characterized by comprising a transmitting device and a timepiece adapted to receive a time change or time check signal developed by the transmitter and, upon demand, which is typically initiated by operation of a switch, to compare the received signal with the time signals constantly developed by the timepiece with the local standard. During the comparison operation, the timepiece is also caused to rapidly step the time signal generatidn means more rapidly than usual to more rapidly effect the comparison. Alarm means may be provided to indicate the need for a time change to the wearer or to serve as a warning or wake up or other reminder to the timepiece holder. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for automatically causing a change in the time displayed by a timepiece to bring the time of the timepiece into conformity with the local time zone. Still another object of the invention is to bring the time displayed by a timepiece into conformity with the time zone in which the timepiece is located by receiving a time zone standard signal, rapidly changing the time stepping rate of the.timepiece, comparing the time displayed by the timepiece against the time zone signal and returning the timepiece to its normal time stepping rate when the signals compare. Still another object of the invention is to provide a timepiece with means for informing the holder of the timepiece of a need for a time change without automatically performing the time change. Another object of the present invention is to provide for the development of an alarm to indicate the need for a time zone change or as a wake up or memory aid. The above, as well as other objects of the invention will become apparent when reading the accompanying description and drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram.of a timepiece adjustment system embodying the principles of the present invention. Figures 2 and 4 are block diagrams showing the electronics of timepieces adapted to incorporate the adjustment circuit of the present invention. Figures 3 and 5 through 8 and 9A show block I diagrams of other embodiments of the invention. Figure 9 shows a circuit arrangement which provides a timepiece with an alarm capability. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTtON Figure 1 shows a system 10 for automatically setting or correcting electronic timepieces in accordance with the time zone in which the timepiece is located. The system 10 includes a time code generator 11 which includes clock means for generating sequential codes representative of time, such as the hours of the day and, in certain instances, minutes of each your in a particular time zone. Generator 11 may also be located in a vehicle such as an aircraft, boat or train traveling from time zone to time zone and may include means for generating code signals which correctly indicate the local time as the vehicle passes from one time zone to another by means which will be described. The output 12 of generator il is connected to a short wave transmitter 13 for transmitting radio waves or ultrasonic waves modulated with the coded time signals generated by output 11. A clock or watch, shown generally as numeral 14, contains a microminiature electronic circuit including a short wave radio.or ultrasonic receiver 15, having an output 16 which is connected through a manually operated or signal responsive switch 17, operated by push button 17A or sonic relay 17B, for example to a line 18 which is connected directly or through OR circuits to circuitry for correcting the time computing and driving circuits of the watch in accordance with the signals generated by time code generator 11 and intercepted by receiver 15.Switches 17 and 26 serve to locally actuate the time zone resetting circuitry by coupling.xeceiver circuit 15 to circuit 17 and coupling battery terminal B to 17. The electronic watch 14 contains hour time generating and display driving circuitry which may be electrically corrected or changed by pulses applied thereto to cause the display driving circuits 33 thereof to activate the hour display units 36 of the time display 35 to display the correct hour of the day for the particular time zone in which the timepiece is located. This correction may be obtained by means of electrical tone or code signals generated on the output 16 of receiver 15 and passed to a first code or tone responsive relay 20 which generates a signal at its output 21. The output 21 of code Cor tone responsive relay 20 is connected to a serial to parallel converter 22 and a trigger switching input 27 of a bi stable flip flop switch 26 which changes state when code responsive relay 20 generates an output and passes energizing electrical energy from battery B to energize a pulse generator 29 which generates a train of pulses and applies these pulses to the hour reset circuitry 30 for the timepiece 14.An output 30A of reset circuit 30 is applied to energize an electronic circuit 32 which generates coded signals a serial fashion, said codes being representative of the time in hours indicated by the output of an hour of day computer and display. driver 33 having an output 32A on which is generated series codes indicative of the hour displayed and such series code signals are applied to a series to parallel converter 24, the outputs of which are connected to respedtive inputs 23B of a code matching relay 23 having its other set of parallel code inputs 23A connected to the outputs of series to parallel converter 22. The device 23 preferably includes a comparator circuit, comprised of exclusiveOR gates, coupled to an AND gate. When the parallel code applied to inputs 23B of the code matching relay 23 compare with or is otherwise equivalent to th.e parallel code of circuit 22 applied to inputs 23A and which represents the correct time for that particular zone, a signal is generated by theAND gates not shown of the comparator and appears at output 25 which is applied to a reset input 28 of flip flop switch 26 causing the flip flop to reset and de energi2e pulse generator 29 so that it ceases to develop pulses at its output, thereby retaining the hour indicating computing circuit 33 in a condition whereby its output 33A, when connected to the hour indicating display 35, will drive said display through driver circuits 34 to indicate the correct hourly time which has now been reset to the time zone in which the timepiece is located by application of the correct number of pulses developed by the pulse generator 29 before its deenergization, as described. The minute display may be reset in the same fashion wherein coded relay 40 sets the signal representing the minutes reading to be displayed into encoder 42 to create a binary Output code at 42A for connection with one set of inputs of comparator 43. The pulse generator is energized by the setting of flip flop 46 under control of relay 40, causing minutes reset circuit 50 to generate pulses representative of the minutes setting in the local time zone. These signals are converted into parallel form by converter 44 for application to comparator 43. The output of circuit 53 applies signals through driver circuitry 54 to the minutes display positions of display 36. Delay line 48D is provided to delay the signal employed to activate pulse generator 49 End being passed to flip flop switch 46. until switch 46 has been closed by the signal transmitted on the output 41 of coded relay 4Q, Figure 2 illustrates a scheme which may be employed in the timepiece of Figure 1 whereby a stable oscillator frequency output is converted into binary coded decimal outputs, corresponding to timekeeping or accumulation of time, for application to an external device requiring such a code. Crystal 61, fixed capacitor 62, trimmer capacitor 63, and amplifier 64 form a crystal oscillator.circuit whose basic frequency is determined by crystal 61 and, dver a limited range, capacitor 63. Divider circuit 65 reduces the oscillator frequency to a pulse rate appropriate for the operation of B.C.D. binary coded decimal divider chain 66,67,68,69,70 and 71, which rate is typically one cycle per second. Divider circuit 66 provides the units of seconds function and its B.C.D.output may be applied, as shown, to decoder driver circuit 74 for subsequent application to visual display unit 80. The operation and circuitry is basically the same for the remainer of the divider chain circuits 67 71, inclusive, according to the following arrangement Circuit 67 is the tens of seconds counter. 75 and 81 comprise the tens of seconds display means. Circuit 68 is the units of minutes counter.76 and 82 comprise its display means. Circuit 69 is the tens of minutes counter.77 and 83 comprise its display means. Circuit 70 is the units of hours counter. 78 and 84 comprise its display means. Circuit 71 is the tens of hours counter.79 and 85 comprise its display means. With regard to circuits 67 and 69, only 3 bits of B.C.D. information 2 , 2 , 22 are required as circuits 67 and 69 need only be provided with a count to 6 capability for timekeeping functions.For clock type operation, circuit 70 need only count to decimal 2, for i2 hour operation, or decimal 4 for 24 hour operation, and therefore need only have 2 binary bits 20, 21 of information or 3 bits 20, zl, 22 of information, respectively, for its output Circuit 79 need only output. a decimal 1 bit 20 or 2 decimal bits 20, 21 of information for 12 or 24 hour operation, respectively. AND gate 73 and time delay means 72 comprise a circuit which resets all counters, with the exception of the units of seconds counter, at a count of 12 59 59 plus 1 count and, at the end of the reset cycle, enter a 1 in the units of hours counter, for 12 hour clock operation. For a 24 hour display capability, AND gate 73 need only be coupled the units of hours clock input, bit 2 , bit 21, and tens of hours bit 21. Delay means 72 is not necessary in this mode as it, is not necessary to preload any counters after bein g reset. The circuits 72 and 73 may be omitted completely if only accumulated timekeeping is required and the tens of hours bits 23 and 22, ones of hours bit 2 , tens of minutes bit 23, and tens of seconds bit 23 now become significant. This would be desirable if the circuit in Figure 1 were, for example, used as a stop watch or running time indicator. The circuit in Figure 3 illustrates a possible means by which a counter, which may be one of a bank of counters, such as are employed in a timekeeping circuit for use An Figure 1, may be brought into identity with a transmitted master time signal. Coded time signals, incoming at receiver 90 originate from master clock and transmitter system comprising a master clock 87 and means 88 for modulating the carrier of a transmitter. The aforesaid signals are applied to decoder 91, which converts the received signals to a usable time code format and applies the information in the converted form to latch circuit 92, which stores the time code until counter 93 is reset. Counter 93 develops an output which is coded, and may for example, be in binary coded decimal format. The output may also be applied to decoder circuit 94 for subsequent application to the driver circuit not shown of a digital display means 95 to visually display the present count in counter 93.The counter 93 ouput is also applied to one or multiplicity of OR gates, represented at 96, 97, 98 and 99, the other input of each gate being connected to the output terminals of time latch circuit 92. If the binary levels of any of the time code lines from counter 93 are found to be out of identity with the codes available from latch 92, one of the outputs 96, 97, 98 or 99 will change state to apply an input to AND gate 100 for resetting counter 93 to zero via reset input 93A.The second input to AND gate 100 is derived from oscillator 101, whose feedback means is represented by 102, which oscillator may already exist elsewhere in the timekeeping circuit, or which may be a part of this circuit. The final input to AND gate 100 is an indication from receiver 90 that a signal, of sufficient strength to decode reliably, has been received. This signal is applied to.set latch circui 103 and is applied to the associated input of AND gate 100 to enable gate 100 until OR gates 96 99 inclusive, indicate that all time code lines are in identity, causing latch 103 to reset via pulse shaping circuit 104. When all of the inputs of AND gate 100 are true, the output developed by gate 100 enables the oscillator signal from oscillator 101 to be passed to manual disable switch 105, which is activated when the user does not wish the timekeeping device to be automatically reset, to apply pulses to counter clock input 93B, thus applying high speed clock pulses to advance counter 93 at a rate which is much faster than the normal rate. This continues until identity exists between the output of counter 93 and latch 92 at which time OR gates 96 99,inclusive, no longer provide a true input to AND circuit 100 thereby abruptly halting the passage of clock pulses through gate 100. The OR gate identity signal also resets latch 103, latch 106, and all the time code latches 92 via pulse shaper circuit 104. AND gate 107 and flip flop 106 are provided to show how an up down counter may be used at 93.The operations are identical to those described above except that AND gate 107 senses when the counter has reached a count of 9, to set latch 106 and cause count down input 93C of counter 93 to be activated.Counter 93 ill now count down until time identity is achieved at which time it is reset by the comparator as previously stated. The counter now responds t o pulses at. its normal clock input 9 3B for continuation of the time keeping .function. The above function might be found desirable tf only one digit is to be reset and it is necessary to prevent erroneous carry output signals from counter output 93D to crate errors in the count of subsequent devices connected to counter 93.This may also be accomplished by automatically disconnecting the counter carry output at 93D for the duration of time identity setting function. Figure 4 presents a format by which any multiplexed 7 segment L.E.D. campatible signal, in this example a watch circuit, may be demultiplexed into a binary coded decimal format. Watch circuit 110, which is crystal controlled by an oscillator circuit comprised of capacitors 111 and 112 and crystal 113, is energized by battery 114, and may have options such as time and set functions 115,. 116, 117. automatic brightness control sensor unit 118, etc., develops a 7 segment signal by 4 digit multiplexed signals for application to segment drivers 119 and digit drivers at 120 which may be an integral part of watch circuit 110. These signals are then applied to a display means such as anL.E.D. display for visual presentation of the time by the 7 segment display devices 121 124. The segment signals are applied via current limiting resistors, to protect the display. The segment signals are also applied to programmable read only memory CROM 125 for decoding to a 4 bit 3.C.D. format. It is not necessary to use all of the 7 segment signals to reliabily distinguish between the digits 0 9. One of several possible segment choices might be the A, B, E, F, and G segments.This choice will provide an unambiguous code and minimize the memory space needed in memory. If desired, the B.C.D. format may be developed in serial fashion at the output of ROM 125 marked bits 20, 21, 22, 23 and clocked at the number of digits times the mux rate of the watch chip 110. Latch circuits. 127 145, inclusive, provide sample and hold functions for the B.. C. D. information produced at the output of ROM 125 and allow that information, to be presented at all outputs at all times. The latch circuits 127 145, inclusive, have their respective inputs coupled to bit 20 or 21 or 22 or 23 outputs of ROM 125 and are selectively enabled by signals derived from the digit drive signal of circuit 110, such that the information gathered and presented will represent the proper digit, be it hours, minutes or seconds. The arrangement of circuits 127 145 in Figure 4 and the separation into hours, minutes and seconds divisions are exemplary of the use of these circuits as a clock circuit decoder, but the basic principle may be applied to any multiplexed output which is desired to be converted to a B.C.D. format. AUTOMATIC TIME ACCURACY AND TIME ZONE CORRECTIONS FORELECTRONEC CLOCKS AND WATCHES An alternative embodiment will now be described of a system which is capable of automatically resetting an electronic watch or clock by one or several master clock s which transmit s coded time signals corrected for time accuracy and or a time zone change. With regard to Figures 5 and 6, the time signal originating means is represented by ,a master clock A1 which is characterized by a high degree of accuracy and which may be derived from presently maintained standard Time Broadcasts or other sources. A time coding means B1 which processes master clock time signals of master clock A1 and conditions them for subsequent application to transmitting means C1, to be transmitted to a receiver incorporated in a timepiece for the purpose of automatic time correction. Figures 5 and 6 and their accompanying explanatory comments show different means by which automatic time correction may be achieved. AUTOMATIC TIME CORRECTION USING PRE EXISTING WATCHCIRCUITRY OR WHERE ONLY MULTIPLEXED SIGNALS AREAVAILABLE The following system, through a simple modification, enables a timekeeping device, which may have as it outputs only a multiplexed signal, and as its only input an oscillator signal, employed to perform a time zone correction. The signal generated by oscillator 150 has a feedback circuit 151 which is preferably a crystal, coupled via AND circuit 152 and oscillating input correcting means 153, has an output multiplexed signal representing the time and which may be applied to visual display means 154. OR circuits 155 159 compare the codes for time output from waitch circuits 110 see Figure 4 with those present at multiplexingAND gate matrix 160 and develop a change of output state if these codes they may be B.C.D. or 7 segment or some other code format are not identical. Receiver circuit 161 derives its input signal via master clock encoder and time transmitting meansA1, B1 and C1 and demodulates it for application to decoder circuit 162 which decodes the master time signals for application to time holding latch circuits 162A and for subsequent application to input multi plexing AND gates 160. The other inputs to gates 160 are derived from the multiplex generator of watch circuit 110, in this case, and as one example, the digit drive signals of watch circuit 110.Gates 160 apply the proper digit information toOR gates 155 159 inclusive to coincide with the same digit information from watch circuit 110. If identity is not present on any one or more of the coded time lines of circuits 11Q and 160, one or more of OR gates 155 159 change their output state to activate an input of AND gates 163 . 166.The remaining inputs of gates 163 166 are derived from, in this example, the digit drive signals of watch circuit 110. When any one of gates 155 159 respond to a lack of comparison, one of the AND circuits 163 166 changes output state to set a corresponding latch circuit 167 170 and create a low input to AND gate 171 which then activates AND gate 172, via inverter 173, and simultaneously deactivates circuit 152, AND gate 172 receives a higher frequency input from oscillator 174, having feedback means 175 The higher frequency is then applied to oscillator input line 153 in place of the output developed by oscillator 150.This rill cause latch circuit 110 to run at an accelerated pace until OR gates 155 159 show a comparison at each bit position. The outputs of AND gates 163 166 then resume their reset states to cause reset circuits. 176 179 comprised of AN gates 176A 179A and inverters 176B 179B to reset latches 167 170 when a corresponding digit drive in this example signal is also inputted thereto. The circuitry of reset circuit 176 is exemplary of one possible construction of such a reset circuit. AND gate 1.71 also has one input derived from a sufficient signal strength output indication originating from receiver 1.6i via lead 180 and manual disconnect switch 181, which enables them user to disconnect the automatic time resetting function. This input indicates a signal of sufficient strength, and an appropriate code capable of being reliably decoded, has been received. This circuit is reset when the watch circuit output time code is identical with that of the master clock circuit A1. DIRECTLY P RESENT ABLE COUNTER TECHNIQUE Tn Figure 6, transmitted coded time signals from circuits A1, B1 and C1 are received by receiver 182, which may respond to transmission by way of a radio frequency carrier, ultrasonic, infrared or other means. After processing, receiver 182 feeds demodulated coded time signals to decoder means 183.Decoded time signals are then applied to presettable counter circuit 184 which may be one of a plurality of counters represented by 184a, 184b, etc. and when an appropriately strong signal is received by receiver 182 and successfully decoded by decoder 183 a preset indication is conveyed via line 185a of circuit 185 to counter 184, which then adopts this time signal and proceeds to count from that time indication and obliterates its ouni previous count. The count, which may be in binary coded dedimal format may further be applied to decoder circuit 186 for subsequent application to display means 187 which may be an LED, LCD, or other means to provide a visual indication of the present count of counter 184. TIME CORRECTION TRANSNITTfl FOR STATIONARY USE Figure 7 is representative of a time correction device which may be employed at a stationary location, such as within a signpost along a road, or at the entrance to or exit from an airport, bus terminal, boat dock, etc. for the automatic resetting of timepieces.such a watches which are appropriately equipped with responsive circuitry. It is intended to deliver to a transmitting means, such as a ratio transmitter, infrared emitter, ultrasonic transducer, or other convenient means, a coded time signal representative of the accurate local time, which may be derived from internal or external timing sources. An accurate time signal may be received by a standard time broadcast radio recetver 190, or a satellite radio receiver 191, whose respective antennae are represented at 192 and 193. This received signal may be an actual coded time signal, or it may be an accurate standard frequency from which the time may be derived in an internal clock circuit 194 referenced to that standard frequency.In either case the time may be in universal time, local time or any other time zone notatron, Alternatively, the signals mentioned above may be derived from a telephone 195 or other hard wired means from a remote location , the local power lines 196, whose frequency over a long period of time is generally very stable, or an integral oscillator 197 of high stability and accuracy, such as a crystal oscillator. A clock circuit has been included in circuit 194 for use. in the case where no stable accurate frequency standard is available from one or more of the above mentioned sources, or any other similar sources. In this case where the actual coded time signals are readily available, such as from sources 190, 191 or 195, the clock circuit 194 is not necessary, unless a standard frequency is concurrently in use, and may be omitted with the coded time signals now being introduced directly to modulator circuit 198 via connection means 191a, 190a, 195a, 196a, and 197c respectively, Modulator circuit 198 may have as an input either coded time signals derived externally, as mentioned above, or coded time signals from the internal clock inlcuded in circuit 194. Sts purpose is to further process the time signals and condition them for subsequent application to transrnitting means 199, which may be any of several convenient means of tranmission such as a radio transmitter, an infrared generator, an ultrasonic transducer, a modulated light source, etc. AUTOMATTC TIME CORRECTION FOR MOB IZ OPERATION Figure 8 is intended to represent a possible structure for a time correction means which may be incorporated in a moving vehicle in which there may be passengers, instrumentation or cargo equipped with timepieces which are capable of being automatically calibrated, by an external source, for actual time and or time zone, date etc., such as a bus, boat or aircraft. An application to an aircraft will be covered in the greatest depth in the following description as one such exemplary system. A standard time code generator 200, which may be similar in construction to that in Figure 7, and a navigational signal generator 203, present their respective information to modulator circuit 201 which applies their coded signals to transmitter 202 for application to antenna 204 for broadcasting to any aircraft within its range. Circuits 201 204 may be pre existing equipment or may be newly installed and adapted to the additional function of time signal broadcasting.Also, circuits 202 and 203 need not necessarily be a navigational beam transmitter, but may be any conventional means available for transmission, such as loran transmitters for boats one or two way voice or other code information channels, which may be more convenient to use for this purpose, or radio, television or satellite stations, for the direct transmission of these time signals, or any other suitable means. On board the vehicle, signals received by antenna 205 are processed by receiver circuit 206 and applied to signal separator 207. Separator 207 removes the navigational or other signals, received by antenna 205 and receiver 206 from the time signals which are of primary interest in the present system. Navigational or other signals from 207 are applied to their instruments in a conventional manner at 208. The time signals from 207 are applied to decoder circuit 209 which may take the time signals directly and conditions them for subsequent application to the remainder of the circuit, or it may respond, in this case, to the unique code broadcast with a navigational or other signal.In the latter case, 208 is preferably provided with a memory of ali the unique codes and their plus or minus quantitative hour relationship to a single time zone such as that for Universal Time, or any other. For each time zone as determined by the pre existing navigational code, circuit 209 would derive an individual code indicative of the number of hours to be added to or subtracted from the standard time U. T., GMT, etc . In the event that the system mentioned immediately above is employed it would be unnecessary to modify the pre existing navigational equipment, except for connection to its output. This would be de s irable for application to aircraft navigational receiver s. Latch circuit 210 accepts the coded signals, which may only be present for a short period of time, and applies them to read only memory tE 213 as a partial set of inputs. Alternatively, manually operated coded time switch 211 may be entered into ROM 213 an lieu of, or in combination with the contents of latch circuit 210, or any other time signal source, represented by circuit 212, which may be an accurate tape recording with time zones stored therein, as well as flight path information from some other source, a navigational satellite, directly or indirectly, etc. The remainder of the inputs to ROM 213 which may alternatively be an adder circuit to combine the hour correction with the standard time signal, is from an adjacent clock circuit 214 which keeps track of time in the chosen zone as mentioned previously UT., GMT or other . This time code may be converted to provide a visual display of the time by decoder and visual display means 215. The output of circuit 213 is a coded version of the present time in the chosen time zone corrected for the present location of the timepiece, and is presented to modulator means 217 which conditions it for subsequent application to transmitting means 218, which may be an infrared transmitter, radio waves, ultrasonic or any other convenient means, This transmission will be short range and is intended for the automatic resetting of timekeeping devices, for example spec ially adapted watches which may be carried by passengers in the vehicle. The present time may also be displayed by decoder and display means 216 for a visual check of the time setting, or simply to display the time as a courtesy to passengers. As an additional alternative it should be noted that it may not be necessary to actually transmit the resetting signals via 217 and 218, but it may be desirable to directly, or indirectly, connect the correction signals to the timekeeping device at the users discretion. Figure 9 shows a circuit arrangement which provides a timepiece with an alarm capability. An alarm code generator 225, energized by power source 226, generates a coded signal which, is applied to transmitter 227 adapted for a small localized transmission range. The timepiece contains a watch receiver 228 which receives and decodes the coded alarm signal and applies it to code responsive relay device 22, When the coded signal unique to the relay device is received, alarm 230 is enabled to provide an audible and or visually observable alarm.

In operation, each room of a hotel may be provided with an antenna having a very short transmitting range. In response to the wakeup request of a motel guest, the antenna in the guest s room is coupled to receive the coded alarm signal. The watch receiver, when energized, picks up and decodes the coded signal and applies it to relay device 229. In one highly simplified embodiment, the signal, which may be of a discrete frequency, is passed through a narrow band pass filter 229A Figure 9A to set a bistable flip flop 229B in the presence of the coded signal. The flip flop output applies an enabling signal to the alarm switch transistor Q1 Opening switch 232 or 233 deactivates transistor Q1, and hence the alarm..A delay circuit 229C may be provided to limit the time that the alarm remains energized, by resetting the flip flop when the delay circuit times out. Switch 233 or 232 is preferably provided with a momentary contact connection 232A with the reset input of the flip flop to reset the flip flop at the same time that the alarm 230 is deenergized. The alarm may also be activated during a time setting operation or may be employed to indicate the need for a time setting operation.

As another alternative arrangement, and considering Figure 2, one output of the counter 65 is coupled to one input of gate G1, which is enabled to couple a pulse of higher frequency to the hours counter unit 70 through OR gate G2.As is well known, the oscillator circuit has a relatively high operating frequency which is divided down by counter 65 to provide a one pulse per second signal rate output 65a. The oscillator may have an operating frequency of 32,768 H . A signal of much higer frequency than one pulse per second may be derived from an intermediate stage of counter 65 to perform the time setting operation at a rapid rate without the need for providing a separate oscillator source.

Alternative forms of the contemplated are within the above teachings as follows I. An alarm such as a solid state or otherwise operated electrical to sound transducer may be employed in one or more of the housings for the personal timepieces which are subject to time correction as described and may be utilized for a number of purposes including indicating when a preset time exists in the time keeping circuitry of the watch. The alarm may also become activated and generate a sound in response to the receipt of an externally generated code signal or radiation received by the receiver of the timepiece or watch either when such code signal is generated or wh.en the watch is brought within range of the radiation so generated as to activate a sensor for sensing such radiation and located within the same housing as the timepiece.For example, a short wave generator of a specific tone or code may be disposed in the vicinity of a hazardous condition in cases where It is desired to warn persons. The code or tone map be generated continuously or intermittently and when so generated, tf a person wearing or holding such time pieces has such an alarm and code or tone sensor in its circuit, the warning signal operates to activate said sensor and alarm. The alarm may also be employed to indicate to the holder of the watch to take a certain action upon activation thereof by a local or remotely generated code signal. II. The timepiece housing may also contain a plurality of different alarms, such as electricalto sound generators which, generate sounds of different pitch or tone or a single, generator which generates a different number of intermittent sounds in response to the activation of different tone or code relays connected to the output of the short wave receiver for the timepiece. Thus the owner or wearer of the timepiece may receive and discriminate between different warnings or indications as defined by the different tones or code signals received by the receiver.III. The timepiece subsystem which enables the holder of the timepiece to receive an audible indication of an environmental condition, may also be used to locally indicate by audible or feel sensor means the time of day in response to locally generated tone or code signals generated by the described clock transmitting means. For example, the sound tranducer may be activated to, gene.rate a nwtibe r of beeps or tones, the number of which, is an indtcation of the local time.Such indication may also be effected by the timekeeping and display driving cirucits of the watch intermittently energizing the. sound transducer.IV. The code signal generator which generates short wave codes for activating the sound transducers of the watches adapted to be so activated, may be timer controlled or computer controlled or controlled in response to movement of a person or object into a sensed field or to otherwise activate a switch or sensor, so as to, generate such short wave signal or signals to effect operation of selected alarms or all alarms in a given range thereof. V. Satellite communication means such as earth satellites or earthbound relay stations may be employed to transmit the described codes to the alarm activating sensors. It should be understood with respect tQ all of the embodiments described above that power supplies having the correct polarities and magnitudes are provided where not indicated in the drawings, to supply proper electrical energy for appropriately operating the various illustrated components and circuits as described in the specification.
