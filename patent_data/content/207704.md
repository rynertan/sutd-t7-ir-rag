# A moist chewing gum composition and a process for making the composition.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a moist chewing gum composition comprising gum base, solid sweetener and liquid sweetener, about 10 to about 35 sucrose fondant and about 0.05 to about 1.5 D.C.L. units sucrose inverting enzyme dissolved in a mobile carrier per 100 g of the composition. The composition has an initially firm texture convenient for processing and packaging, and develops and retains a soft moist texture as a result of inversion of sucrose dissolved in the liquid phase of the fondant to produce the humectant sugars glucose and fructose.
