# Airflow sensor of the vane type.

## Abstract
Airflow sensor of the vane type for indicating the airflow through a cylindrical air induction bore 16 , comprising a rectangularly shaped vane 12 which is pivotally mounted in a cylindrical bore 26 which is normal to the air induction bore 16 and of a greater diameter than the induction bore 16 , the vane 12 being mechanically coupled to an air motor 14 rotating it to maintain a substantially constant differential pressure across said vane 12 , whereby making nonlinear the changes in angular position of the vane 12 in relation to changes in airflow through the induction bore 16 . A gas filled bellows 54 may be provided to modify the positioning of the vane 12 by the air motor 14 to compensate for temperature and pressure variations.
