# Shock and vibration sensitive switch.

## Abstract
A shock and vibration sensitive switch for detecting the presence of an intruder comprises two E shaped electrodes 13 mounted on opposite sides of a cavity 15 . Two inertia weights 16 are supported by the electrodes and are in an electrical parallel arrangement, whereby the inertia weights provide redundant current paths allowing proper switch operation in the event of failure of one of said current paths. The switch is hermetically sealed 18 to prevent moisture and the contaminants outgassed by the switch lead wires 21 from entering the interior of the switch.
