# CONSTRUCTION AND OR APPLICATION IN RELATION TO THE GENERATION OR THE USE OF PRESSURES, FORCES, FLOWS AND MOVEMENTS IN AND BY MEANS OF HYDRAULIC OR HYDRO PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS

## Abstract
The main object of this invention is the generation of pressures, forces, flows and motion and several methods are given in principle concerning the application of the hydraulic scheme as well as the constructions which are especially suitable for the generation. Characteristic for these hydraulic schemes are the consis tent pressure or volume controlled schemes and the flexible adjustment between the motion of the piston and the motion of the hydraulic flow. With this a universal rotating control valve is important characteristic of it is the adjustabiliiy of the relative opening times in different phases. Further a mass motion reactor which transforms kinetic energy into pressure. The applications are mainly related to transport under influ ence of shock, asymmetric vibrations, dynamic effects by asymmetric vibrations and effects on the frictional resistance by vibrations and savings in and simplification of construc tions by replacement of static forces which require a frame through dynamic forces where the reaction is supplied by the inertia of a mass, where this is useful for the speed, and the simplicity is the pneumatic drive combined with the hydraulic drive.
