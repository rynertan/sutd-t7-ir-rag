# Single Chip Microprocessor having means for selectively outputting instruction decoder control signals.

## Abstract
An improved architecture for a single chip microproces sor CPU includes provision for directly observing at its ter minals the control signals from its instruction decoder to facilitate functional testing of the chip. The CPU, upon receiv ing a command signal transfers the signals on the control lines 209, 409, 509 of its instruction decoder to its output terminals. In one embodiment of the invention the command signal is applied to the CPU chip at a designated input termi nal. In another embodiment, the command signal is applied through a special instruction. The improvements permit increased functional test fault coverage and shorter test programs.
