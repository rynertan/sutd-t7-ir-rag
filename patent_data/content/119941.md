# A COLOR PRINTING CONTROL SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
The color printing control system has a color printer 58 and a microprocessor 14 . The output of photocells 52a, 52b, 52c which read color negatives is applied to the micro processor 14 enabling it to calculate print time signals. These signals are applied to paddles 32, 34, 36 and move them into the light path of terminate light exposure. A print test probe 59 coupled to the microprocessor 14 reads the density of the prints and forms a feedback loop which allows the microprocessor to adjust its internal values. Color bal ancing is performed without knowledge of paper characteris tics and without operator setup calculations. This is achieved using the difference in density between a reference print and prints made by the system as a basis for calculating correc tion factors which are applied to such values as slope to cause subsequent print time signals to result in correct den sity.
