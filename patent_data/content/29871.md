## Description
PENICILLINS This invention relates to a class of penicillins which have antibacterial activity and are of value in the treatment of infections in animals, including man and poultry, caused by a wide range of Gram negative organisms. In particular the invention relates to a class of 6 methoxy a carboxy penicillins. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. British Patent Specification No. 1,339,007 discloses inter alia a class of 6 substituted acylamino penicillins of general formula A EMI1.1 where RA represents an acyl group, RB is a hydroxy or mercapto radical, a substituted or unsubstituted methoxy, ethoxy, methyl, ethyl, methylthio, or ethylthio radical, a carbamoyloxy, carbamoylthio, C1 6 alkanoyloxy, C1 6 alkanoylthio, cyano or carboxy radical or a derivative of a carboxy radical such as carbamoyl and RC is a hydrogen atom or a pharmaceutically acceptable esterifying radical or cation. In that specification the only a carboxy substituted acyl group RA which is specifically disclosed is 2carboxyphenylacetamido and specific examples of such a side chain are exemplified with the following RB groups methyl, cyano, aminomethyl and 2 carboxy 2aminoethoxy. There is no disclosure of a 6 methoxy substituted penicillin having an a carboxy substituted acyl side chain. In abstract No. 368 of the Program and Abstracts of the 14th Interscience conference on AntimicrobialAgents and Chemotherapy held on 11th 13th September, 1974 in San Francisco, California, U.S.A., a report is made of a single 6 methoxy penicillin within formula A above, namely 6a methoxy 66 2 carboxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid. That compound, although active against a number of Gram negative organisms, is not effective against infections caused by pseudomonas organisms. British Patent No. 1425571 discloses certain esters of penicillanic acid derivatives having an organic acylamino side chain and an alkoxy substituent at the 6 position. We have now found a small class of 6 methoxy acarboxy penicillins, which have activity against Gramnegative organisms including pseudomonas.

Preferred silylating agents are silyl chlorides, particularly trimethylchlorosilane. The term N phosphorylated derivative of compound III is intended to include compounds wherein the 6 amino group of formula III is substituted with a group of formula P.R Rb wherein Ra is an alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy or dialkylamino group,Rb is the same as Ra or is halogen or Ra and Rb together form a ring. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the groups C02RX and CO2 V in formula III and IV include salts, ester, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction.

Suitable ester groups of formula CO 2Rx and CO2 RY include the following i COOCRcRdRe wherein at least one of Rc, Rd and R is an electron donor e.g. p methoxyphenyl, e 2,4, 6 trimethylphenyl, 9 anthryl, methoxy, acetoxy, methoxymethyl, benzyl or fur 2 yl. The remaining Rc, Rd and Re groups may be hydrogen or organic substituting groups. Suitable ester groups of this type include p methoxybenzyloxy carbonyl, 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyloxy carbonyl, bis E methoxyphenyl methoxycarbonyl, 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyloxycarbonyl, methoxymethoxy carbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl. ii COOCRcRdRe wherein at least one of Rc, Rd and Re is an electron attracting group e.g. benzoyl, p nitrophenyl, 4 pyridyl, trichloromethyl, tri bromomethyl, iodomethyl, cyanomethyl, ethoxy carbonylmethyl, arylsulphonylmethyl, 2 dimethyl sulphoniumethyl, o nitrophenyl or cyano.

The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis. Alternative methods of cleavage include reaction with Lewis acids, such as trifluoroactic acid, formic acid, hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, zinc bromide in benzene and aqueous solutions or suspensions of mercuric compounds. The reaction with the Lewis acid may be facilitated by addition of a nucleophile such as anisole reduction with agents such as zinc acetic acid, zinc formic acid, zinc Cl 6 alcohol, zinc pyridine, palladised charcoal and hydrogen, and sodium and liquid ammonia attack by nucleophiles, such as those containing a nucleophilic oxygen or sulphur atom for example alcohols, mercaptans and water oxidative methods, for example, those which involve the use of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid and irradiation. Suitable hydroxyl protecting groups RZ include acyl groups such as acetyl and benzoyl, and aralkyl groups such as benzyl. A reactive N acylating derivative of the acid IV is employed in the above process. The choice of reactive derivative will of course be influenced by the chemical nature of the substituents of the acid. Suitable N acylating derivatives include an acid halide, preferably the acid chloride or bromide. Acylation with an acid halide may be effected in the presence of an acid binding agent for example tertiary amine such as triethylamine or dimethylaniline , an inorganic base such as calcium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate or an oxirane, which binds hydrogen halide liberated in the acylation reaction. The oxirane is preferably a C2 6 1,2 alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.The acylation reaction using an acid halide may be carried out at a temperature in the range 50 to 500C, preferably 200 to 30 0C, in aqueous or nonaqueous media such as aqueous acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, l,2 dichloroethane, or mixtures thereof.Alternatively, the reaction may be carried out in an unstable emulsion of water mmiscible solvent, especially an aliphatic ester or ketone, such as methyl isobutyl ketone or butyl acetate. The acid halide may be prepared by reacting the acid IV or a salt thereof with a halogenating e.g. chlorinating or brominating agent such as phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Alternatively, the N acylating derivative of the acid IV may be a symmetrical or mixed anhydride.Suitable mixed anhydrides are alkoxyformic anhydrides, or anhydrides with, for example carbonic acid monoesters, trimethyl acetic acid, thioacetic acid, diphenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, phosphorus acids such as phosphoric or phosphor acids , sulphuric acid or aliphatic or aromatic sulphonic acids such as p toluenesulphonic acid .The mixed or symmetrical anhydrides may be generated in situ. For example, a mixed anhydride may be generated using N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy l , 2 dihydroquinoline. When a symmetrical anhydride is employed, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of 2,4 lutidine as catalyst. Alternative N acylating derivatives of acid IV are the acid azide, or activated esters such as esters with cyanomethanol, E nitrophenol, 2,4 dinitrophenol, thiophenol, halophenol, including pentachlorophenol, monomethoxyphenol or 8 hydroxyquinoline or amides such as N acylsaccharins or N acylphthalimies or an alkylidene irainoester prepared by reaction of the acid IV with an oxime. Some activated esters, for example the ester formed with l hydroxybenztriazole or N hydroxysuccinimide, may be prepared in situ by the reaction of the acid with the appropriate hydroxy compound in the presence of a carbodiimide, preferably dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Other reactive N acylating derivatives of the acid IV include the reactive intermediate formed by reaction in situ with a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, for example N,N diethyl , dipropyl or diisopropylcarbodiimide, N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or N ethyl Nl a dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide a suitable carbonyl compound, for example N,N carbonyldiimidazole or N,N carbonylditriazole an isoxazolinium salt, for example N ethyl 5 phenylisoxazolinium 3 sulphonate or N t butyl 5 methylisoxazolinium perchlorate or an N alkoxycarbonyl 2 alkoxy l,2 dihydroquinoline, such as N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1, 2 dihydroquinoline. Other condensing agents include Lewis acids for example BBr3C6H6 or a phosphoric acid condensing agent such as diethylphosphorylcyanide.The condensation reaction is preferably carried out in an organic reaction medium, for example, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, alcohol, benzene, dioxan, or tetrahydrofuran. The compounds III may be prepared for example by the method described by Jen et al J. Org. Chem. 1973, 38, 2857 from an ester of a compound of formula EMI13.1 which compound may in turn be prepared from the corresponding 6 isocyano compound as described in ourW. German Offenlegungsschrift number 2,407,000. Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VI EMI14.1 wherein Rx is as defined above with respect to formula III above with an acid of formula IV or a carbanion of formula IV A EMI14.2 and thereafter if necessary carrying out one or more of the following steps i removal of any hydroxyl or carboxyl blocking group ii converting the product to a salt or ester thereof. This reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range 100 to 5O0C in an inert organic solvent, such as methylene dichloride, in the presence of a basic catalyst such as triethylamine, pyridine or a nitrogen containing aromatic mono or bi cyclic compound such as 4 methoxy dimethylamino pyridine, l methyl benz imidazole or imidazo l,2 a pyridine. A third method of preparation of the compounds of formula I comprises a protecting the 3 carboxylic acid group of a 6 a methoxy 6 B acylaminopenicillanic acid with a carboxyl blocking group b reacting the protected penicillanic acid to form an imino bond on the 6 amido nitrogen atom c reacting the resulting compound to introduce a group QRf on the imino carbon atom, wherein Q is oxygen, sulphur or imino and Rf is an alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group of from 7 to 14 carbon atoms, to form an iminoether, iminothioether or amidine when Q is 0, S or N respectively d reacting with an acylating derivative of an acid of formula IV above e treating with water or an alcohol and f thereafter if necessary carrying out one or more of the following steps i removal of any hydroxyl or carboxyl blocking groups ii converting the product to a salt or ester thereof. In the above process, after protection of the 3 carboxylic acid group, the protected penicillanic acid is reacted with an agent to form an imino bond on the 6 amino nitrogen atom. Preferably an imino halide is formed of formula VII EMI16.1 wherein R0 is the residue of an organic acylamino sidechain of a penicillin, Rx is a carboxyl blocking group and Hal represents a halogen atom. A suitable agent for preparing an imino halide is an acid halide in the presence of an acid binding agent such as a tertiary amine, e.g. pyridine, triethylamine, or N,N, dimethylaniline.Examples of suitable acid halides are phosphorus pentachloride, phosgene, phosphorous pentabromide, phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride and p toluene sulphonic acid chloride. Phosphorus pentachloride and phosphorus oxychloride are preferred. The reaction may be conducted under cooling, preferably at temperatures from 0 0C to 3O0C when phosphorus pentachloride is employed. The amount of the tertiary amine is preferably 3 5 mois per mol of phosphorus pentachloride. It is also preferable to use the phosphorus halide in an amount slightly in excess of that of the starting material. The resulting imino compounds are then treated to introduce a QRf grouping, onto the imino carbon atom, to produce a compound of formula VIII EMI17.1 wherein R , Q, Rf and RX are as defined above with respect to formula VII . This is preferably effected by reacting an imino halide with a corresponding alcohol. Examples of suitable alcohols for reaction with the imino halide are aliphatic alcohols containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, amyl alcohol and butyl alcohol, and aralkyl alcohols such as benzyl alcohol and 2 phenyl ethanol. The reaction of the alcohol with the imino halide is preferably effected in the presence of an acid biNding agent, such as a tertiary amine, preferably pyridine, and the reaction is usually carried out without isolating the imino halide from the reaction mixture. Thereafter the compound VIII is caused to react with an N acylating derivative of an acid of formula IV . The comments made above concerning such N acylating derivative, and the conditions for carrying out acylations also apply in this case. In particular the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine or N,N dimethylaniline in the reaction system is preferred. The product from such an acylation has formula IX EMI18.1 Finally, the addition compound IX is treated with water or alcohol. The water treatment may be conducted together with the isolation of the desired material. That is, water or a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride is added to the compound IX and then the aqueous layer formed is separated from the organic solvent layer. Alternatively a compound of formula IX A EMI18.2 wherein RO, RX, Ry and RZ are as defined with respect to formulae IV or VII and V is the residue of anN acylating derivative of the acid IV , e.g. hydroxy, halogen, acyloxy, aryloxy, amino, cyano, azido may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding N acylating derivative of IV with the Schiff s base formed by reacting 6a methoxy 66 amino penicillanic acid or a carboxyl protected derivative thereof with an aldehyde RO.CHO. The compound IXA may be hydrolysed to a compound I with water optionally in the presence of acid or base. A further method for the preparation of compounds of formula I is by hydrolysis of an 6 a methoxy N acylbenzyl penicillin of formula X EMI19.1 wherein RX, RY and RZ are as defined with respect to formulae IV or VII . The hydrolysis may be an acid or base catalysed chemical hydrolysis or may be an enzymic hydrolysis with the aid of penicillin acylase.The compound X may be prepared either from an iminohalide compound of formula VII where RO is benzyl by reaction with a salt of the acid IV or by the action of an acid halide of the acid IV with a 6 Nalkali metal derivative of 6a methoxy benzylpenicillin or with its 6 N trimethylsilyl derivative. The compounds of formula I wherein R1 is an ester group may also be prepared by esterification of a compound of formula XI or a reactive esterifying derivative thereof EMI20.1 wherein RZ and Rx are as defined with respect to formulae III or IV with an esterifying derivative of an acid of formula R1OH, wherein R1 is as defined in formula I and thereafter if necessary carrying out one or more of the following steps i removal of any hydroxyl or carboxyl blocking groups ii converting the product to a salt or ester thereof. Many methods of esterification using several different combinations of reactive esterifying derivatives are known from the literature. For example, the esterification reaction defined above may be achieved by reacting a compound of formula XI A EMI20.2 wherein RZ, Rx are as defined with respect to formulae III or IV with a compound of formula XII R1 V XII wherein R1 is as defined in formula I , under conditions which cause the elimination of the elements of compoundU V with the consequent formation of an ester of formula I the symbols U and V in formula XI A and XII being such that either U represents hydrogen or a saltforming ion and V represents a hydroxy group, an alkylsulphonyloxy group, an arylsulphonyloxy group or a halogen atom or U represents an organic acyl group and V represents a hydroxy group. Usually it will be found satisfactory to react compound XI A wherein U is a sodium or potassium ion with compound XII wherein V is a halogen atom, especially bromine or chlorine. In the case where the group U in reagent XI A is an organic acyl group, it will be clear that XI A is simply a mixed anhydride. The acyl group may be one of a wide variety of aliphatic or aromatic acyl groups but generally the alkoxy carbonyl groups e.g. C2H50CO group are satisfactory. Another reactive esterifying derivative of compound XI above is the acid halide, particularly the acid chloride. This compound may be reacted with the hydroxy compound R1OH in the presence of an acid binding agent to prepare the desired ester of this invention. A further method for the preparation of compounds of formula I comprises reacting a compound of formula XIII EMI22.1 wherein RZ and RY are as defined with respect to formulae III or IV , R2 is defined with respect to formula I and R3 is lower alkyl or benzyl A with chlorine or bromine at 250 to 800C and subsequently decomposing the resultant halosul phonium halide with methanol and a base or B with methanol in the presence of a metal ion, such as a tellurium III , lead IV bismuth V mercury, lead, cadmium or thallium salt. Preferably this reaction is carried out at 500 to 25 0C in a solvent. Compounds I may also be prepared by reducing a compound of formula XV EMI22.2 wherein Rx is as defined with respect to formula IV and simultaneously or subsequently acylating with anN acylating derivative of an acid of formula IV above and thereafter if necessary i removing any hydroxyl or carboxyl blocking group ii converting the product to a salt or ester thereof. Suitable N acylating derivatives of the acid IV are as described above. Various methods of carrying out the reduction of the azido group may be used, but a preferred method is by catalytic hydrogenation using a noble metal catalyst such as platinum, palladium or oxides thereof. The intermediate of formula XV may be prepared as described in British Patent number 1,339,007. The antibiotic compounds according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics, and the invention therefore includes within its scope a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I above together with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compositions may be formulated for administration by any route, although an oral adn iinistration is preferred.The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maizestarch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica disintegrants, for example potato starch or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl hydroxy benzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired convention flavouring or colouring agents. Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, e.g. cocoa butter or other glyceride. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection is supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use.Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene exide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. The compositions may contain from 0.1 to 99 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50 500 mg. of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 to 3000 mg.per day, for instance 1500 mg. per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. It will be clear that the side chain of the penicillins of formula I contains a potentially asymmetric carbon atom.

Palladium on carbon 10 0.40gm was added and the mixture hydrogenated for 1 hour. The mixture was filtered through Celite Registered Trade Mark , the residue being washed with distilled ethanol 5ml . Further catalyst 0.40gm was added and hydrogenation continued until removal of benzyl ester was complete as shown by T.L.c.on silica gel in Chloroform acetone acetic acid in 50 50 7. Water 25ml was added and the ethanol removed in vacuo. The mixture was made just alkaline with sodium bicarbonate solution, washed with diethyl ether and acidified with 5N hydrochloric acid. Extraction with diethyl ether 2 x lOml , drying and evaporation in vacuo gave a mixture of 6,a methoxy 6, D,L 2 carboxy 2 4 benzyloxyphenyl acetamidoapenicillanic acid and the required 4 hydroxyphenyl product. The disodium salt of the two dicarboxylic acids was prepared by treating the mixture dissolved in dry acetone with two equivalents of sodium 2 ethylhexoate as a 2M solution in 4 methylpentan 2 one . The solid was filtered, washed with dry acetone and dried.This solid was dissolved in distilled water and hydrogenated as described above omitting the use of ethanol at any stage , and the aqueous solution was acidified to pH 2.0 using dilute hydrochloric acid.
