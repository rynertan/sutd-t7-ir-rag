# Tape of drinking straws.

## Abstract
A tape of drinking straws in which each straw 1 is enclosed between two sheets 2 of paper joined together using a known cold or hot method. The tape is equipped with two biadhesive strips 3 along its edges which allow each straw to be easily placed on a box container 4 . In this way, the tape of drinking straws is prepared in a single processing phase and in a very economical manner. At the same time, the disadvantages of placing the straws on the containers using liquid glues are eliminated.

## Claims
Claims 1. Tape for drinking straws able to feed an automatic machine for applying the straws to the outside of box containers made of cardboard or the like, characterized in that said tape is prepared in one single processing phase incorporating the straws 1 between two strips of paper 2 joined together along the sides of each straw using a known hot or cold procedure the straws are inserted transversely along the tape parallel to one another and a constant distance apart. 2. Tape for drinking straws according to claim 1, characterized in that the adhesive incorporated in the tape for applying the straws to box containers made of cardboard or the like consists of a biadhesive strip 3 , that is one adhesive on both sides, along each of the edges of the tape for straws said strip 3 allows each straw to be applied directly to its respective container 4 . 3. Tape for drinking straws according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that two transverse notches 5 are provided in correspondence with the narrow strip joining the straws together said notches 5 may hook up with drag cogs in the automatic machine for applying the straws 1 to the containers 4 .

## Description
Tape of drinking strawsThis invention conccrns a new strip package for drinking straws capable of feeding an automatic machine designed to place the straws onthe outside of cardboard box containers.As is known, drinks, mineral water, milk, etc. are currently sold in box containers of cardboard or the like.In the particular case of drinks, the container is provided with a point easily penetrated under pressure in order to allow a common straw to be introduced and used.This straw is usually glued to the outside of the box to form an integral part of the package.Automatic machines are currently used for this gluing operation which are fed by a tape of straws made up of a series of individually wrapped straws kept the appropriate distance apart by two thin adhesive strips parallel to one another near the opposite ends of each straw.This tape of drinking straws is thus prepared in two quite distinct packaging operations that is, the wrapping of each individual straw in its hygienic protection paper and the union of all the suitably positioned straws by means of the two above mentioned strips running along the edges of the tape.It is obvious that the nozzles for dripping the fast dry ing glue tend to be blocked up quite easily, given the nature of the glue, with obvious negative consequences.The aim of this invention is thus to propose a new method of packaging the tape of straws in question, in order to make this packaging more simple, rapid and economical while at the same time ensuring that they are perfectly parallel, that is, that the distance between one straw and another remains constant.A further aim of this invention is to provide the tape of straws with an already incorporated adhesive or placing the straws on the cardboard box containers, or the like, with no necessity that complicated gluing systems be installed on the above mentioned automatic machines.This invention achieves these pre established goals by preparing a tape of straws in a single processing phase.The straws are incorporated between two strips of paper joined together along the sides of each straw by means of a known hot, or cold, procedure and are inserted perpendicular to the tape parallel to one another and a constant distance apart. The invention also provides that the adhesive incorporated in the tape for placing the straws on box containers of cardboard, or the like, is made up of a biadhesive tape, that is one with adhesive on both sides. This tape runs along each edge of the tape according to the invention, and allows the direct application of each straw to its respective container. For the sake of greater clarity, the invention is described below in more detail with reference to the attached exemplifying but non limiting drawings of a preferred form. The figures show figure 1 an axonometric view of a section of the tape according to this invention figure 2 an axonometric view of a cardboard container on which has been placed a straw taken from the tape according to this invention.In the tape according to this invention, each straw 1 is completely enclosed between two sheets 2 of paper which are joined together using a known hot or cold method, depending on the properties of the paper used.Said tape may easily be packaged with an automatic machine consisting essentially of two rollers with suitable external longitudinal grooves parallel to one another with a wheelbase such that said two strips of paper may be joined together. These strips are advanced by these same rollers. As is evident, the straws are positioned one after the other at regular intervals between the strips of paper just before the latter pass between the rollers and are joined together along the sides of the pre inserted straw. Such a machine is not however the object of the present invention. Anyone operating in this area could manufacture such a machine, obviously if provided with elementary and common technical knowledge of this specific area. Preparation of the tape according to this invention no longer requires the previously necessary two quite distinct and successive packaging processing phases that of the straw and that of the tape. Instead only one single phase is required since the tape is formed at the same time as each individual straws wrapped.Moreover, it is evident that this procedure for preparing the tape ensures in itself that the straws are perfectly parallel and at a constant distance from one another.Again in reference to figure 1, the tape according to this invention is provided with two thin strips 3 adhesive on both sides attached along the edges of said tape, on the outside of all the straws 1 enclosed between the two sheets of paper. Said strips 3 allow each straw to be placed on its container with no complications, as shown in figure 2. In fact, it is sufficient that the automatic machine for applying the straws be equipped with mechanical arms to fold and press the biadhesive strips 3 against the walls of the container 4 . Finally, the tape according to this invention is provided with two small notches 5 corresponding to the narrow transverse strip joining the straws together. These notches may hook up with any drag cogs in the abovementioned automatic machine for applying the straws to the containers, so that said tape advances constantly and uniformly.As a variation, each straw may be applied to the container by using an appropriate hot or cold gluing system of a known type or by means of ultrasonic or infrared rays.
