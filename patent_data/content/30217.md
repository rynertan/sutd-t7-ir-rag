# Air guiding device in burners.

## Abstract
Burners, for example oil burners, with a feed tube 12 and a burner retainer 13, 15 inserted into the same. The air stream in the feed tube is made to be affected by a retarding shield 20 positioned ahead of the burner retainer 13, 15 and having a central aperture for the flame and a substan tially circularly surrounding gap 18 between the retarding shield 20 and the inner periphery of the feed tube, and by a flange 19 extending rectangularly inwards from said inner periphery and which is positioned in spaced relation to the retarding shield in the direction of flow of the air. The spac ing between the retarding shield 20 and the flange 19 is adjustable.
