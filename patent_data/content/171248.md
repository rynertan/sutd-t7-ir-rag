# Process for the preparation of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol.

## Abstract
A continuous process is disclosed for preparing 2,2,2 tri fluoroethanol from 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethane, preferably 2 chloro 1,1,1 trifluoroethane. In the process, 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethane, a carboxylic acid salt and a hydroxylated com pound such as water are continuously provided to a reaction mixture in a reactor. The 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethane, the car boxylic acid salt and the hydroxylated compound are reacted therein at a reaction pressure at or above the autogenously de veloped pressure and at a reaction temperature of from about 223 C to about the critical temperature of the hydroxylated compound. At least a portion of the reaction product mixture is continuously withdrawn from the reactor and unreacted 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethane is separated therefrom. The sepa rated unreacted 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethanne is recycled as part of the 2 halo 1,1,1 trifluoroethane provided to the reac tion mixture. The 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol is recovered from the reaction product mixture.
