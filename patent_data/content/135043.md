# A continuous decontamination decomposition process for treating halogenated organic compounds and toxid substances.

## Abstract
A device is described which comprises a column or a cartridge containing a carbonate, bicarbonate or alumina supported reagent composed of a polyethylene glycol or a condensation polymer of various types of alkene oxides, a base and an oxidizing agent. The device is capable of decontaminating fluids contaminated with polyhalogenated organic compounds, such as PCB, DDT, dioxins, etc., in a continuous manner, and is suitable for use in association with, and during operation of, conventional electrical appar atus containing said contaminated fluids
