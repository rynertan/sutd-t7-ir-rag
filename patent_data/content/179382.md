# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium comprising a substrate, a ferromagnetic thin film formed on the substrate, and a protective film formed directly on the ferromagnetic thin film, and a process for producing such magnetic recording medium. The expression formed directly refers to the technique for forming the protective film on the ferromagne tic thin film so that the interface therebetween is free from contamination by, for instance, conducting the protective film formation under the vacuum used when forming the ferromagnetic thin film.
