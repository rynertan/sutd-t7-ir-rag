# Gripper mechanism for feeding elongate strips.

## Abstract
A gripper mechanism 10 for feeding a pair of elongate strips such as a pair of slide fastener stringers 13, 14 has a pair of gripper holders 15, 16 supporting a pair of grippers 17, 17 for gripping the slide fastener stringers 13, 14 , re spectively, and a pair of sliders 23, 28 joined to the gripper holders 15, 16 , respectively, and slidably disposed in a hous ing 26 for independent movement therein. In response to en gagement with a cam 37 or 38 on a feed path, the grippers 17, 17 are opened to grip or release the slide fastener string ers 13, 14 . The grippers 17, 17 are normally urged by a spring 39 to clamp the slide fastener stringers 13, 14 . A pin ion 43 is angularly movably supported on a slide block 42 in the housing 26 and held in mesh with a pair of racks 40, 41 respectively, of the sliders 23, 28 . A spring 39 acts between the housing 26 and the slide block 42 for normally urging the slide block 42 in a direction to move the gripper holders 15, 16 into abutment against the housing 26 . The gripper holders 15, 16 can be moved relatively to each other toward and away from the housing 26 .
