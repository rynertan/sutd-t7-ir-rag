# Anode for use in the evolution of oxygen from alkaline electrolytes and a process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
An electrode for use in the evolution of gas from alkaline electrolytes comprises an electrically conductive support surface, a porous metal layer adhered to at least part of the support surface and a deposit of Ni OH ₂ on the surface of, and within the pores of. the porous metal layer. The surface density of the deposit must not exceed 10 mg cm². Prefer ably the deposit is produced by cathodically treating the support with its porous metal layer in an aqueous solution containing nickel ions.
