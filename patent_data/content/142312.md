# Laminating transparent film to a base.

## Abstract
Clear film is laminated to a base such as paper, paper like materials, plastics and board through the medium of an adhesive which is curable by ultra violet or electron beam radiation. The adhesive is irradiated through the clear film to cure it in the absence of oxygen excluded by the act of bringing the film and base together. High solids adhesives with low viscosity and a high flash point are preferred such as methacrylates and dimethacrylates.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A process for laminating film transparent to ultra violet radiation and high energy electron beams to a base such as paper, paper like materials, plastics and board characterised in that the adhesive selected for use is one which is slow curing by said radiation or beams in the presence of oxygen but faster curing in the absence of oxygen to give a non yellowing cured product, and the curing takes place by radiation through the film in the absence of oxygen excluded by the act of bringing the film and base together. 2. A process as claimed in claim 1 in which the adhesive has 95 100 solids. 3. A process as claimed in claim 2 in which the adhesives 0 are of low viscosity such as 2.5 cps at 21 C. 4. A process as claimed in claim 3 in which the adhesives are methacrylates or dimethacrylates having a flash point in excess of 950C.

## Description
LAMINATING TRANSPARENT FILM TO A BASE This invention relates to laminate adhesives and is concerned with adhesives for laminating film transparent to ultra violet radiation and high energy electron beam to a base such as paper, paper like materials, plastics and board. It is known in the packaging and book cover manufacturing fields, to laminate clear plastics film suc as orientated poly propylene or polyester to printed paper or board to give a bright, durable and clear product.The known process involves using a solvent or water based adhesive 3h 50 solids which is applied to the film and then subjected to infra red heating to evaporate the solvent or water base and initiate curing. The film is then applied to the paper or board and curing is allowed to become complete. This process involves the dispersal or recovery of solvents which may be environmentally troublesome, or hazardous, or costly or water a relatively high consumption of energy per unit area of laminate and relatively slow 15 30 metres min production rate. The process according to the invention, on the other hand, can use adhesives having high solids approaching 100 and hence no solvent problems is curable by radiation such as ultra violet or electron beam and hence involves a lower power consumption and has a relatively high 50 100 metres min production rate dependent on the number of radiation sources employed. The invention is based on the appreciation that, whilst U.V. curable adhesives are well known they tend to be slow in curing as atmospheric oxygen acts as an inhibitor, nevertheless, when used in the limited context of laminating film to a base it is now appreciated that they are fast in curing because the curing can be arranged to take place in a substantially oxygen free environment merely by the simple act of bringing the film and base together. The invention accordingly resides in a process for laminating film transparent to ultra violet radiation and high energy electron beams to paper, paper like materials, plastics, or board characterised in that the adhesive selected for use is one which is slow curing by said radiation or beams in the presence of oxygen but faster curing in the absence of oxygen to give a non yellowing cured product, and the curing takes place by radiation through the film in the absence of oxygen excluded by the act of bringing the film and base together. Preferred adhesives have very high solids even 100 and they are of low viscosity such as 2.5 cps at 21Or Typical adhesives are methacrylates and dimethacrylates incorporating non yellowing photo initiators and flow additives and supplementary acrylates such as unsaturated urethane, polyester and epoxy acrylates . Such adhesives have the added advantage of a high flash point typically in excess of 950C . Adhesives having substantially lower than 100 solids can be used but may require a preheating such as by infra red. The adhesives proposed are currently recommended for use in rubber compounding and as improvers such as in PVC plastisols, cast acrylic sheet and the dental industry. In one way of carrying the invention into effect for making book cover material, orientated poly propylene clear film having a thickness of 13 p is brought into contact at a roller having a peripheral speed of 30 100 metres min with a printed board having a thickness of 300 600 y and a coating of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate incorporating l hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone as photo initiator, and unsaturated urethane acrylate, polyester acrylates and epoxy acrylates. After the laminating process at the roller the laminate is passed below two medium pressure mercury ultra violet lamps so that radiation passes through the film and effects curing of the adhesive. The invention, when used with high solids typically 95 100 , provides a process which is faster than any known process, avoids waste, avoids volatiles, avoids flash problems, and is non toxic. Equipment used can be compact as no long infra red furnaces are required and the product is of high brightness, durability and clarity.
