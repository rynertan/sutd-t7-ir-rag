# Catalyst compositions for curing polythiopolymercaptan polymers.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition, for mouth temperature curing of liquid polythiopolymercaptan polymers to produce elas tomeric dental impression materials, comprises acid treated submicron zinc oxide, the treating acid preferably being propionic acid, and purified benzothiazyl disulphide 2,2 dithiobis benzothiazole . The composition contains at least 20 by weight of the acid treated submicron zinc oxide, not more than 20 and preferably 5 to 20 by weight of substantially pure benzothiazyl disulphide and 20 to 50 by weight of plasticizer.
