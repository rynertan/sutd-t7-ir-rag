# Electrostatic spraying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic spraying system comprises a spray re servoir, with spraylines leading to a sprayhead 11 at which spray liquid is electrostatically charged and atomised. The sys tem incorporates an ion pump comprising an insulating con duit 25 leading to the sprayhead 11 , a sharp or pointed ion injection electrode 29 mounted in the conduit, an ion dis charge electrode 30 in the conduit downstream of the ion in jection electrode, and means 31 for applying a potential diffe rence of the order of kilovolts between the two.
