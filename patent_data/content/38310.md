# Ballistic projectile with extendable fins.

## Abstract
A ballistic artillery projectile has extensible fins 1 for stabilizing the trajectory in the terminal phase, after an initial spin being imposed on firing. The fins 1 are attached to the projectile 2 by means of torsion bar pivots 3 designed to be twisted on extension of the fins 1 by centrifugal forces, so as to undergo plastic defor mation. The fin attachment is intended to render harmless impact forces when the fins 1 hit a stop and locking device in their extended position.
