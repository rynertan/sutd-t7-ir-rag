## Description
A JOINT IN PREFABRICATED INSULATED PANELS. This invention is concerned with a joint between prefabricated insulated panels of the kind made up of two sheets made generally of metal, and between which there is inserted a filler material possessing heat and sound proofing qualities. The intention is to achieve a tight, rigid and positive joint between either identical or non identical panels, and accordingly the joint is either symmetrical or non symmetrical. The joint whose novelty is claimed under the present invention is characterized by the fact that on one surface of each of the panels, there is a tongue and a groove lying alongside one another at a point very close to the edge, while the opposite surface possesses a groove whose posit ion may vary with respect to said tongue. Grooves on the same surface may be at the same distance from the edge of the panels or not. The invention is also characterized by the fact that in each one of said grooves facing towards the same side there is inserted a seal piece which is self locked therein upon being compressed towards the panels, and by the fact also that in the two grooves on one same side, there is also inserted a fastening piece which is superimposed upon the seal piece on that same side, while the assembly thus formed is pierced by securing arrangements to fasten it to a structure. It is furtherllere ctijractri,cd by the fact that on the outside there is a joint cover on one face of the joint which is press fitted onto sect ions on the panels so as to conceal the tongues and the joint. It is characterized moreover by the fact that each of said grooves is an elongated cavity which takes up the whole or part of the width of the panel, and possesses a U cross section, one of whose arms is sloped negatively away from the web. It is also characterized because one of the seal pieces at least possesses a U shape with short arms sloping negatively away from the web, so that when such seal pieces are proffered up to the joint between panels, their arms are housed inside the grooves and lock a protru ding portion which originates from the negative slope of one of its arms to seal the joint. It is moreover characterized because at least one but preferably a plurality of curved, inclined, sloping or any other kind of curved confi gurations are formed on one of the sheets by stamping or pressing which reduce its overall length L2 as measured along a tangential line to the portions that protrude most from its outline with respect to the overall length L1 of the other sheet as measured in an identical manner, so that in the panel construction, the ends thereof are offset from one another by an angle a which is in proportion to the difference in lengths, d L1 L2. Figure 1 depicts an elevational section view of the general arran gement of the panels. In this particular case, the joint between panels is symmetrical on the left hand joint, but it remains clearly understood that it could be asymmetrical as explained elsewhere, while the right hand joint lacks joining means for the lower sheets lb . Figure 1 also depicts the tongue A whose chief purpose is to give the assembly a feeling of continuity, because from the outside, tongue A might be mistaken for the joint cover 5 , although the assembly may also lack said tongue A . Figure 2 shows an enlarged elevational view of a joint between insulated panels in Figure 1. Figure 3 depicts an elevational view of a joint between insulated panels in Figure 1, but without the asymmetrical joint. Figure 4 is a diagramatic view of a panel with an offset angle obtained by means of a curve from two straight end pieces and shapes 110 in sheel lb . The joint between prefabricated insulated panels is applicable to panels 1 of the kind made up from two plates lea and Ib upper and lower respectively as shown in the figures between which there is sandwiched a filler material lc which has heat and sound proofing properties. This fill material is held at the side by a gasket seal 6 . Sheets la and lb possess a tight bend 100 and 101 on their edge intended for the joint between panels. This bend 100 on sheet la that is, the upper sheet in the drawings clasps the edge 61 of the gasket seal 6 , whilst the other edge 62 rests upon the bend 101 in sheet lb . The gasket seal 6 possesses a central area 63 which cushions the joint between the two panels. The joining edges of the panels shown in Figure 2 are symmetrical in shape, and as may be seen from that figure, each one defines a groove 12b on its lower sheet lib , a groove 12a on the opposite surface, and in direct opposition to the above groove, a tongue 11 adjacent to groove 12a which protrudes from the upper sheet lea on each panel 1 , a section 13 for assembling other parts of the joint explained elsewhe re . The joint shown in Figure 3 is asymmetrical, and here it may be seen that the groove 12b on the lower sheet Ib is offset with respect to the groove 12 on the upper sheet Ic . The joint being dealt with here also comprises seal pieces 2 , fastening piece 3 , securing arrangements 4 , and a joint cover 5 . Grooves 12a and 12b are identical to one another, and each possesses a U shaped cross section where one of the arms 121 is negatively sloped from the web. Tongues 11 protrude with respect to the upper sheet la of panel 1 and one of their walls 111 is common to one of the arms 122 of the groove lea on the upper sheet la . Section 13 , which is preferably half round in section, is provided on the very sheet la of panel 1 which defines the tongue 11 , and may be located upon the panel 1 itself, on the tongue 11 or, preferably where the two meet together as is shown on the drawings. Tongue 11 possesses protrusions or indentations lla which afford it improved stiffness. At least one of the sealing pieces is a single piece body 2 in a U section having a very wide web and not very long arms 21 . These arms 21 are curved in a convex concave fashion in the form of two successive and facing curved lengths. Both sealing pieces may be identical to one another Figure 3 . Optionally, and in accordance with Figure 2, one of the sealing pieces may be a single piece body 2 in a U section having a very wide web and not very long arms 21 . These arms 21 define three successive lengths as follows a first length 211 that is parallel or substantially parallel to the web a second or intermediate length 213 , and a third length in a slope 212 facing inwards. In this case, the outer face of the sealing piece 2 protrudes from the outside face of the lower panel lib As a further option, lower plate lb may, in the event of embodying a sealing piece 2 , define undercuts 14 see Figure 1 in which is seated portion 211 of the sealing piece 2 , where the web of this latter lies in the same plane as the lower sheet lb . All these options are interchangeable with one another. Fastening piece 3 is a single piece body possessing a U section with a wide web and short arms. Said arms are accommodated in grooves 12a on the upper sheet la . The joint cover 5 is a single piece body possessing a U section whose arms 50 may lie at right angles to the web 52 or, prefera bly, diverge slightly away from one another. The tips 51 of the arms 50 are curved in shape and bent about themselves. The invention is completed with the securing arrangements 4 , which preferably comprise bolts that may lie In one row Figure 3 or in two rows where the bolts are staggered Figures 1 and 2 , or in other similar arrangements. With the make up as described above, assembly is carried out as follows panels 1 are placed in abutment to one another sealing pieces 2 , 2 are applied to either side and engaged by pressing. Their arms 21 are accommodated in grooves 12a , 12b and embrace the sloping arm 121 thus forcing the panels 1 towards each otter fastening piece 3 is inserted in a superimposed position upon one of the sealing parts 2 , and its arms too are accommodated in the grooves on that side a structure not illustrated is attached to the assembly by means of securing arrangements 4 , which in this case are bolts which are inserted through the fastening piece 3 , the sealing pieces 2 , 2 and the panels 1 which are previously drilled with holes the outside assembly is insulated by inserting the joint cover 5 , for which purpose its sections 51 are housed in slots 13 provided on the upper sheets la . The invention also provides for the possibility of obviating the need for the joining means on the lower sheet ib , in which case there would be no grooves 12b or lower sealing pieces 2 , and a total continuity could exist between the lower sheets lb of the two panels to be joined See Figure 1, right hand joint . The tongue A in the area where same engages with the panel assembly possesses an indentation 51 bis which prevents the filler material lc from becoming detached from the upper panel la .
