# Cement burning plant.

## Abstract
Apparatus for burning cement clinker and including a preheater 1,2,3 a suspension calciner 8,9 a sintering furnace 13 and a cooler 18 . The sintering furnace comprises an inclined rotatable sintering drum 4 and a suspension inlet duct 15 which is fed with waste cooling air to entrain calcined material and which discharges the material with a rotary flow into the upper end of the drum so that the material is deposited on the wall of, and slides down, the drum to an outlet. The material is brought to sintering temperature by the burning of fuel supplied through an inlet 16 leading into the duct 15 and or through an inlet 19 leading into the drum.
