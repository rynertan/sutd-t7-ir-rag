# Method and apparatus for executing object code instructions compiled from a high level language source.

## Abstract
A high level language processor is utilized in a system with a conventional host computer for executing object code instructions compiled from a high level language source. Object code instructions specifying low level operations e.g., input output, interrupt, and scheduling are executed in the host computer in accordance with a stored emulator program. Upon identification by the emulator program of an object code instruction specifying a high level operation, the language processor is activated. The central processing unit CPU in the language processor reads object code context section information from the host computer memory into a local memory. Using an instruction pointer in the context section, the language processor CPU reads the next high level language object code instruction from the procedure section in the host computer memory and performs a required complex operation. Execution of the object prog ram by the language processor continues until an input output command is encountered, whereupon the informa tion in the context section is written back into the host computer memory and an interrupt is issued to re activate the emulator program. The emulator program then runs executing the input output command and continues until the next high level language object code instruction is encoun tered. Object code context section information is switched back and forth in the foregoing manner between the host computer memory and the language processor local mem ory until the entire object program has been executed.

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EXECUTING OBJECT CODE INSTRUCTIONS COMPILED FROM A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE SOURCE The present invention relates to processing of highlevel language commands in a computer system and more particularly, it relates to a hardware high level language processor for use in a system with a conventional host computer. Heretofore, when running a high level language e.g.,COBOL, PASCAL, FORTRAN, BASIC computer program, it has been necessary to use a compiler program to convert the program commands to object code or machine language. The objectcode is then executed by an emulator program in the computer system. Run times of such execution are lengthy because each high level language object code command can require several hundred system memory cycles to execute.Improvements in computer system performance have been achieved by increases in memory size and memory access speed. Also, there have been improvements in the central processing unit CPU . Along with these improvements, high level language processing performance has correspondingly been improved, but the approach has remained the same. In accordance with the present invention, a language processor is utilized in a system with a conventional host computer to execute object code instructions compiled from a high level language source. In accordance with the present invention, high level language operations are performed in the language processor, and the low level operations including input output, interrupt, and scheduling operations are performed in the host computer. Apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises a host computer having a memory containing the compiled object code instructions. The host computer executes in accordance with a stored emulator program only object code instructions specifying low level operations.A language processor is coupled to the host computer and activated thereby upon identification by the emulator program of an object code instruction specifying a highlevel operation. The language processor accesses the host computer memory and executes the high level instruction. Before executing a program, the object code consisting of a procedure section, a data section, and a context section is placed in the host computer memory in the same manner as if the program were to be executed by the software emulator program. The emulator program executes only those object code commands that specify a low level operation. Upon encountering an object code command in the program that requires a complex operation, the emulator program provides the address of the context section of the program to the language processor. The emulator program then ceases operation, although the host computer may continue to attend to other ongoing input output operations. The language processor is activated by the setting of a pointer to the context section and reads the information from the context section of the object code.Using an instruction pointer in the context section, the language processor reads the next object code command from the host computer memory and performs the required complex operations. Execution by the language processor of the object code program continues until a low level operation object code command is encountered, whereupon the language processor writes the context section information back into the host computer memory and issues an interrupt to the host computer to re activate the emulator program. The operation of the system continues under the direction of the emulator program until the next complex object code command is encountered. Object code context section information is switched back and forth between the language processor in the host computer memory until the entire program has been executed. The language processor may be coupled to the host computer over a system bus. The language processor includes a central processing unit CPU , a control memory storing microcode commands for execution by the CPU and a local data memory. As indicated in the discussion of the method of the present invention for processing object code commands, the CPU of the language processor is activated upon identification by the emulator program in the host computer of an object code instruction specifying a highlevel operation. Upon activation, the CPU accesses the host computer memory to read information from the context section of the object code and store it in the local data memory of the language processor.Thereafter, the CPU accesses the host computer memory using an instruction pointer in the stored context section information to read the next command from the procedure section of the object code and execute the specified high level operation. A written description setting forth the best mode presently known for carrying out the present invention, and of the manner of implementing and using it, is provided by the following detailed description of preferred embodiments which are illustrated in the attached drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a diagram of the operation of a system in accordance with the present invention for processing high level language commands Fig. 2 is a diagram of the system concept illustrating the arrangement of system elements Fig. 3 is a diagram of object code context section switch operation Fig. 4 is a diagram of language processor functional elezaents and Fig. 5 is a schematic of circuitry for implementing the test and status logic block indicated in Fig. 4.Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment A. Structure of High Level Language Object Code Languages are compiled into object programs that all have the same basic structure, regardless of language.There are three classes of data generated by a compiler to define an executable object program a procedure section, a data section, and a pseudo machine context section. The procedure section contains codes specifying which highlevel language operations are to be performed and in what order. The data section contains data to be acted upon and a place to put results. The pseudo machine context section contains information that completes the meaning of the codes in the procedure section and storage for temporary results. In the Context Section, the Instruction Pointer is a value which points to the command in the Procedure Section which is to be executed next. The Accumulator s and or a Stack are storage locations reserved for intermediate results left between commands. The Data Section pointers are values which indicate where in the Data Section various data items are located. The Status Flags are values which temporarily hold control information between commands. They along with the Instruction Pointer determine which commands are to be executed next. In the conventional implementation of High Level Languagess, an emulator program is run which performs, in software, the operations that need to be done to execute the program specified in the Procedure Section, above.Using the Instruction Pointer from the Context Section the emulator references a command in the Procedure Section. The command code is then decoded by emulator software to determine what action to perform on the Data and Context Sections. The emulator program then operates on the Data and Context Sections to perform the specified operation. When that is done, the sequence is repeated for the next command in the Procedure Section until the entire High Level Language object program is completed.Examples are Language Compiled Source Oblect Cod Executed BY Emulator COBOL POPS Commands POPS Interpreter PASCAL P Codes NP Code Machine Emulators B. System Concept Referring now to Figs. 1 3, the system concept andoperation thereof in accordance with the present invention for processing higholevel language commands is diagramed. In Fig. 1, the operationindicated shows that source program statements are compiled using a compiler programinto object code stored inthe memory of a host computer. Low level operations including input output, interrupt, and schduling operations are executed using a software emulator program, and the results are stored in the host computer memory.The complex or high level operations in the program are specified by the object code in the host computer memory, and are executed by the hardware language processor. Fig. 2 shows that the host central processing unit CPU , the host computer memory, the language processor and the input output interfaces coupling to peripheral devices are all coupled to a common system by memory bus.The bus may be, for example, in accordance with the UNIBUS used in computer systems made by the Digital EquipmentCorporation. Alternately, the system memory bus may be aTILINE bus system as utilized in the computer systems ofTexas Instruments Inc. In Fig. 3, there is diagramed the host computer memory contents and the language processor central processing unit CPU and local data memory. Fig. 3 is illustrative of the switching operation between the host computer memory and the language processor local data memory involving object code context section information.When the emulator program in the host computerfencounters an object code command in the data section which requires complex high level language operations i.e., the operations do not involve input out, interrupt or scheduling operations , the emulator program places the address of the context section of the program in an interface register to the language processor. The emulator program then ceases operation, while allowing the host computer to attend to other ongoing input output operations. The language processor CPU which is activated by the setting of a pointer to context reads the information from the context section of the host computer memory and places it into a local data memory in the language processor.Using the instruction pointer in the context section, the language processor CPU reads the next object code command from the procedure section of the object code and performs the required complex operations. The language processor continues to execute object code program commands until a low level command is encountered. Upon identification of a low level operation, the language processor CPU writes the context section information back into the host computer memory and issues an interrupt to the host computer to re activate the emulator program. The emulator program then resumes operation and continues until another complex high level language command is encountered in the object code program. Context section information is then switched back to the language processor.Switching of the context section back and forth between the host computer memory and the language processor local data memory continues until the entire program has been executed. Operation in accordance with the present invention may include more than one language processor to provide even higher levels of performance and redundancy. This configuration is also illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 wherein a second language processor is shown coupled to a first language processor. Operation in such a configuration may be required where the Host computer is run in a multiprogramming mode. For operation with multiple language processors, the emulator program must be designed to assign an available language processor when a highlevel language instruction is bid to run. As used herein, the term Nmulti programmingn refers to the running of multiple programs using a single host computer. C. Language Processor Structure Referring now to Fig. 4, there is shown a functional diagram of the structure of the language processor. In general, the language processor comprises a CPU having control memory storing microcode commands that direct functional operations in the processing procedure. The microcode is initially loaded into the language processor by the host computer. Suitably, the microcode may be contained on a diskette and loaded into the language processor control memory from the diskette. The language processor may also be viewed as comprising two cooperative parts. These are a data path and a microcontroller. The data path includes those portions which perform operations on data, and the microcontroller includes those portions which provide the control commands to the data path portion. In the language processor 10 shown in Fig. 4, the microcontroller portion 12 is shown to include a microsequencer 14 providing an address to control memory 16.The microinstruction pointer selects the next microinstruction to be executed. The microsequencer also contains logic to select the next value to be placed into the microinstruction pointer which value may either be an incremented current value or a new value loaded from B bus 18 or from pipeline register 20. Control memory 16 stores the microcode which determines the overall operation of the language processor.Each word is one microinstruction of the microcode.Microcode is loaded into control memory 16 through load buffers 22 comprising bi directional data transfer logic.Preferably, control memory 16 is 8,192 words by 64 bits wide. Accordingly, load buffers 22 provide for the reading and writing of 64 bit wide words from the 16 bit host computer memory bus. Pipeline register 20 is a 64 bit register used to hold the micro command read from control memory 16. This register makes it possible for the language processor to overlap microinstruction fetch and execution. Outputs of pipeline register 20 are distributed as controls to other logic blocks within the language processor. Also, pipeline register 20 provides an address to local data memory 24. Local data memory 24 comprises 1,024 registers, each of which is 16 bits wide. Data can be written into memory 24 or read out of memory 24 over the A bus 26. Local data memory 24 functions to hold object code context section information which, of course, is switched between language processor 10 and the host computer. Data buffers 28 and address buffers 30 couple to the host computer memory bus. These bi directional drivers move data and memory address information respectively, between the host computer memory bus and the interface registers 32. The interface registers comprise four 16bit registers containing information to be exchanged with the host computer memory bus. These four registers include a read write data register, two memory address registers, and a status register. The interface registers 32 interconnect with load buffers 22 and data shifter 34. The data shifter allows data read from interface registers 32 to be shifted right or left and masked in order to select decimal digits from the 16 bit word. Bits implemented in the interface status register are accessible to both the Host computer and the language processor. They, along with an interrupt to the host, provide the control communication between the processor and programs in the host. The bits indicate conditions inside the processor to the host and allow the host to start and stop the processor. For example, an IDLE bit indicates to the host that the processor is not running.The processor FAULT bit provides the combination Host processor with redundant back up in case the processor fails. A self test microprogram in the processor is run before the processor is used. If it sets the FAULT bit, then the interpreter program in the host is run to execute all of the object program commands. Although execution is very slow, the system can still be used. The A bus 26 and the B bus 1B present data to a decimal binary arithmetic unit 36. Operations performed by the arithmetic unit are determined by commands from the microsequencer. The result of the operation is made available on the Y bus 38. Preferably, the arithmetic unit is 16 bits or 4 decimal digits wide. The operations which arithmetic unit 36 is capable of performing include the following binary or decimal addition or subtraction all combinational logic operations and left or right shifts. Register file 40 contains registers providing storage of 16 words of data. The width of the register is 16 bits or 4 decimal digits. Any one of two registers can be selected to the Abus or the B bus. A register selected to the B bus may be loaded with data available on the Y bus. Finally, language processor 10 includes test and status logic 42. Control of microinstruction branching is by means of the test and status logic. This logic functions under control of the current microinstruction in pipeline register 20 to select some condition in the data path to be used in a determination of whether a microinstruction branch would be performed. Referring to Fig. 5, a schematic diagram for test and status logic 42 is presented. This circuitry basically samples data signals using a set of flip flops contained in device 50 SN74LS174 device and flip flop 52. The direct inputs CO, OV, N and Z are from the arithmetic logic unit 36. Bit 15 of the Y B bus is applied to flipflop 52 and entered therein by an address logic clock controlled by bit 34 from the pipeline register 20. TheKey output of flip flop 52 is applied along with the compliment of bit 34 from a pipeline register 22 AND GATE 54. Bit 54 of the pipeline register and bit 15 of the Y B bus are applied as inputs to AND GATE 56. OR GATE 58 receives the outputs of GATES 54 AND 56 and generates an output for entry in flip flop device 50.The remaining input to flip flop device 50 is from OR GATE 60 which receives the signals CYC and RMW which are derived from bits 0, 1, and 2 of the pipeline register 20. Flip flop device 50 is clocked by the pipeline register clock. The Key outputs of flip flop device 50 are applied to various gates as shown to generate the indicated signals.These additional gates perform a re coding function to provide a more diverse set of microcode jump commands.For example, the combination of the EQ signal Y B bus 0 and the CO no carry signal in OR GATE 62 provides a re coded signal indicating the Y B bus is less than or equal to 0. The re coded signals are applied to selector circuits 64 and 66 SN74LS251 devices . Pipeline register bits 5, 6 and 7 determine which of the 16 inputs will be tested.The output signal CC is applied to microsequencer 14 to indicate whether or not a microcode jump is to be performed. D.
