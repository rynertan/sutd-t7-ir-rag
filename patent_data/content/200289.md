# Safety system for laser utilising facilities.

## Abstract
A safety system for a laser beam utilising facility incor porates a safety enclosure 24 and an infra red monitoring system 32 for detecting the development of hot spots at internal surfaces of the enclosure walls 24 and ceiling 26 which may occur as a result of stray laser radiation impinging on such surfaces. The development of a hot spot leads to shutting off the laser source 10 or interruption of the beam by means of a shutter 22 .
