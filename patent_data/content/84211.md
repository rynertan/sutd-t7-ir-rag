# Process for recovering animal hair grease.

## Abstract
Animal hair grease is recovered in a high yield from a scouring waste liquid obtained from a scouring process of a raw animal hair material with a hydrophobic organic solvent and containing a scouring extract derived from the raw animal hair material. The process for this comprises the steps of A converting the scouring waste liquid to a flock forming liquid by the following operations, which may be carried out in any sequence, a adding water to the scouring waste, b adjusting the content of the scouring extract in the flock forming liquid to 20 to 70 based on the entire weight of the flock forming liquid, c adjusting the content of water in the flock forming liquid to 2 to 110 based on the weight of the scouring extract, and d adjusting the temperature of the flock forming liquid to 80 C to 100 C, whereby flocks are formed in the flock forming liquid B removing the flock from the flock forming liquid, whereby a residual liquid containing therein purified animal hair grease is obtained and C recovering the animal hair grease from the residual liquid.
