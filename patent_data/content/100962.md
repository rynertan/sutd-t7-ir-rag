# Bill dispense control system.

## Abstract
In a bill issuing machine, a designated denomination and amount of bills can be dispensed from a plurality of bill cartridges 8 11 . All bills dispensed are fed to an issue gate 17 which is automatically opened to the operator when any denomination of bills is exhausted during the dispensing operation, the operation is continued through dispensing the other designated denominations of bills. Then, the issue gate is not automatically opened but kept closed to have the operator manually open it, thereby indicating to the operator that an insufficient number of bills was dispensed. Also, the missing amount can be displayed to the operator.
