## Description
This invention relates to a camera which can use lenses of varying focal lengths and, particularly, to a variable focus type camera employing a programmed shutter capable of changing an open aperture value of the lens when the focal length of the lens used with the camera is changed. In certain embodiments this invention relates to an exposure controlling means and an electronic flash controlling means each for the variable focus type camera improved so as to make a proper exposure and flash timing without needing a larger data storing capacity. Generally, a variable focus type camera is so constructed that the lens system thereof is moved or an auxiliary lens system is attached or detached with moving the main lens system, so that a focal length f of the lens system may be changed. However, as is well known, in a lens where the principal point coincides with the position of the exit pupil thereof, the following relation holds Generally in a variable focus type camera having a built in aperture unit, the abovementioned relation means that there is a difference in F number between a short focus lens f W and a long focus lens f T , even if their aperture diameters are the same. In other words, the exposure when using a short focus lens is different from that when using a long focus lens, even if the shutter speeds are the same. Figure 6 illustrates the above description, wherein it is indicated that the exposure with a short focus lens f W is different to that with a long focus lens f T when the exposures are made through an electromagnetic programmed shutter under the same shutter speed conditions, i.e. the same exposure times because F numbers are different from each other. In a camera having a conventional type variable focal lens, the exposure can be compensated by providing an aperture mechanism or the like in the front of the AE photoreceptor of the camera to allow the aperture values to be changed or switched using a filter, in accordance with the aperture values of the lens which varies with the focal length of the lens. However, such cameras have a complicated construction. Alternatively, a variable focus type camera using a programmed shutter, which makes automatic exposures in accordance with the memory of the shutter speeds corresponding to subject brightness, requires automatic exposures to be made in such a manner that individual tables corresponding to the focal lengths of f W or f T of the lens are memorized, and the appropriate table corresponding to the focal length of the lens used is called up. In a camera having an aperture shutter combination, an exposure amount for electronic flash photography may be controlled by variously changing the aperture size as indicated by the aperture size variation curve in such a process of opening a shutter as indicated by A in Figure 6. This is also well known. In the case that an exposure amount for electronic flash photography is controlled by the moment of starting a flash emission, as mentioned above, it may be considered to take the same means as mentioned above when using a variable focus type camera. However, in a variable focus type camera, it is necessary to prepare a time table of starting each electronic flash emission for every focal length, so that a large amount of memory is needed. It is an object of the invention to provide an exposure control means for variable focus cameras, whereby automatic exposures can be performed without any complicated mechanism and the need for a large number of memories. According to the present invention, there is provided an exposure control device for a camera in which the open aperture value of the camera lens changes as the focal length of the lens changes, the device comprising Another object of the invention is to provide a controlling means for controlling an electronic flash timing without requiring any complicated mechanism or needing a large number of memories. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention there is provided an exposure control device for a camera in which the open aperture value of the camera lens changes as the focal length of the lens changes, the device comprising The above aspects of the invention may be combined to provide an exposure control device for a camera in which the open aperture value of the camera lens changes as the focal length of the lens changes, comprising Thus with the invention, an exposure control means for a variable focus camera, in which an aperture value is varied according to the change of a focal length, is characterised in that a photometered value is shifted, according to the switch over of focal lengths, on a signal table of the exposure control means which has thereon the corresponding relation between the photometered values and shutter speeds. The invention will be more closely understood from the following description which is given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates a binary focus type camera which is an example of a variable focus camera Figure 1 a illustrates the arrangement where the focal length of a lens is shortened, to a short focal length f W , by pushing the lens barrel 11 into the camera body and Figure 1 b illustrates the arrangement where the focal length of a lens is lengthened, to f T , by pulling lens barrel 11 out from the camera, wherein 10 indicates the surface of film. A taking lens comprises a main lens system 12 and interposable auxiliary lens system 13 interposable into the main lens system 12 each attached to lens barrel 11. When the lens barrel 11 is pushed in, the auxiliary lens system 13 is removed from the optical path of the taking lens to form a short focus lens f W , and when the lens barrel 11 is pulled out, the auxiliary lens system 13 is moved into the optical path to form a long focus lens f T together with the main lens system 12. Further, a shutter means 14 capable of serving also as an aperture is arranged to the inside of the main lens system 12. Lens barrel 11 reciprocates along a guide member 15 on the optical path of the taking lens to switch from one focal length to the other. Micro switches S W and s T are provided to the guide member 15 so that the micro switch S W is switched to ON when the lens is in the position of a short focus lens f W , and to switch the micro switch S T over to ON when the lens is in the position of a long focus lens f T , respectively. F number of the lens at an aperture is F 3.3 in the case of the short focus lens f W and F 5.8 in the case of the long focus lens f T . There is a difference of 1 2 3 in terms of exposure values EV corresponding to an ISO 100 film. Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of the photometering circuits which may be used in the invention which is so designed as to detect a subject brightness in such a manner that a photoreceptor, CdS, is provided face to face with a subject and capacitor C1 is cleared, and then in a charging time TLS the cleared capacitor C1 can charge up to a prescribed voltage VC. Figure 3 illustrates the output voltage of each section shown in Figure 2. A time TLS, required for reversing a signal AEI, is measured in such a manner that a pulse signal is put out, by switching ON a first step switch S1 of a shutter release button, to AEO section to clear the capacitor C1, which then starts charging, and when the voltage at the point AEB has reached a prescribed voltage VC, the signal AEI is reversed by a comparator CP, so as to meausre the time photometered time between starting to charge capacitor C1 and reversing the signal AEI. Table 1 exhibits an example of the relations among photometered time TLS, a light value LV corresponding thereto at a film speed of ISO 100, and photometric zones AET segmenting the LV by a certain width, wherein ΔTLSs denoted by the differences in parentheses represent the respective ranges. Table 2 exhibits an example of shutter speeds TAE Time necessary for operating shutter blades in the opening director corresponding to photometric zones AET in the case of using short focus f W . In the table, the shutter speeds TAE shown therein represent those used when an ISO 100 speed film is used. Memory means 5 shown in Fig. 4 houses a table indicating the relations between photometric zones AET and shutter speeds TAE, which are shown in Table 2. As is obvious from the above table, the photometric zones AET are segmented in accordance with an APEX system additive system of photographic exposure , by every 1 3EV step. Generally, an exposure value Ev is related to a subject brightness Lv and an ISO film speed in terms of apex indexes, by the following equation Added thereto is the information Fv of the indexes, Fv W and Fv T , indicating the effective apertures of a lens of every focal length to provide the following apex equation with every step of 1 3Ev In this example, F number of a lens at open aperture is F 3.3 in the case of f W or F 5.8 in the case of f T , and there is a difference of 5 3EV between the above two lenses. Therefore, Fv T will be 5, provided that Fv W is zero. Accordingly, the following equations may be effected In this example, therefore, an automatic exposure AE can be performed with a variable focus type camera having a programmed shutter without needing a large number of memories therein in such a manner that a built in table of an exposure control means, registering the relations between photometric values and shutter speeds, is shifted 5 stepwise according to the switch over of a focal length. Fig. 4 is a basic block diagram illustrating this invention. The exposure control means is controlled by a controlling means 1 such as an IC or the like arranged on the inside of the camera. A subject brightness information given by the aforementioned photometric means 2 is fed into the controlling means 1. Information means 3 feeds the ISO speed information of a loaded film. In a camera compatible of using a DX system film, the ISO speed information thereof is automatically read from the loaded film cartridge thereof and is then fed into the controlling means 1. In shutter mechanism 4, a shutter which jointly serves as an aperture, is gradually opened up to full aperture from the closed position at a command given from the controlling means 1, and is then switched over to close the blades thereof by a shutter closing signal given by the controlling means 1. The controlling means 1 gives the shutter unit 4 an instruction of a shutter time from opening the shutter to closing it in accordance with a segmented subject brightness information given from photometric means 2, an ISO film speed information given from information means 3 and an information given from switch S W or S T instructing that a picture taking is to be made with the use of a lens in a focal length out of the aforementioned f W and f T . For this purpose, the controlling means 1 has a memory means 5 which memorized the table shown in Table 2. In this binary focus type of camera, the prior art would require the provision of both a table applicable to f W and a table applicable to f T . In the invention, however, it is sufficient for the memory to store only one of the tables respectively applicable to f W and f T . Table 3 exhibits shutter speeds in the form of a table, set on the basis of the ISO speeds and the brightness information with respect to a lens f W . The whole table covers EV8 to EV17, Table 3 shows only a part EV13 16 thereof. In Table 3, the figures in the parentheses indicate the above mentioned segmented zones in terms of every 1 3EV step, in the apex system. When a taking lens has the focal length f W , the shutter speeds are determined according to the contents of Table 2, and an exposure is to be made. When the taking lens is switched over to f T in this example, the lens is slowed down in keeping with 1 2 3EV. As shown in Table 3, the ISO speeds are provided into a built in program of a controlling means so that they may be shifted stepwise at every 1 3EV, it is, therefore, possible to make an exposure in such a manner that the ISO speed of a film which is to be practically used is shifted to 5 steps lower and the shutter speed corresponding to the lowered ISO speed is read. In the case that a picture was taken with an ISO 200 film by making use of a lens f W and the lens f W is then switched over to a lens f T , a proper shutter speed may be determined to take the next picture by shifting the ISO film speed to ISO 64. Reference to table 2 shows that it is also possible, rather than shifting the ISO speed, to use a value of photometric zone shifted upwards by five steps. The same may also be applicable to the case that an electronic flash photography using an electronic flash having a prescribed guide number is to be made according to a distance measurement information. A camera to subject distance measured by a distance measuring means 6 is segmented into 15 AF zones, for example. Table 4 exhibits a part corresponding to AF zones 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the table corresponding to ISO speed indexes, effective aperture indexes of a lens and distance measurement information indexes, similar to relation between the aforementioned photometeric zones and shutter speeds. The relation of ISO zones and AF zones to shutter speeds may be shifted in accordance with the built in program of the controlling means. This will be described later. According to Table 4, an electronic flash timing is selected to AF zones and ISO speeds, shutter unit 4 stays open after receiving a command to open the shutter until the shutter speed indicated in the table is completed and, at this moment, the electronic flash 7 fires and the shutter unit is to be closed. For example, when using a lens f W and an ISO 400 film and taking a picture of a subject positioned at a distance in AF zone 5, a flash emission and a photographing are performed in an electronic flash timing of 5.62ms. When switching the focal length of the taking lens over to f T to take a picture of the same subject, the electronic flash timing is switched over to 10.06ms, that is, 5 steps in the ISO zones are shifted to ISO speed of 125. In addition to the above, the invention can be embodied in electronic flash photography using a program capable of performing a daylight flash synchronization. In this case, the computation is carried out in accordance with Tables 3 and 4, however, a closer aperture priority system is adopted therein. To be more explicit this system is adopted in such a manner that the shutter speeds shown in Table 3 determined by photometric means 2 are compared with the electronic flash timing shown in Table 4 determined by distance measuring means 6 to find the shorter shutter speed, so that the shorter shutter speed has priority and both of an electronic flashing and a shutter closing may simultaneously be operated at this shutter speed. In this case too, a taking lens may be switched from F W over to f T by shifting the ISO speed zones of a film with the equivalent to the difference between the open aperture values, in accordance with Tables 3 and 4. The preceding description relates to a binary focus type camera. In a multi focus type camera of the invention, on the other hand, a proper exposure can be made, regardless of the changes in the focal distances of the taking lens thereof, by shifting an ISO speed table of the relations between photometric values and shutter speeds in accordance with the changes of the open aperture value of the lens. Fig. 5 shows an example of the exposure flow charts for the binary focus type cameras of the invention. Wherein, a RAM is cleared by switching the first stage switch S1 of a shutter release button ON so as to read at first the ISO speed of a loaded film. When the ISO speed of the film is ISO 100 or lower, a photometric value AET is set to MAX 34. Next, the controlling circuit switches the AEO shown in Fig. 1 OFF to start charging capacitor C1, so as to commence an integration. Now, a timing is set to 0.92ms by a photometric zone value AET1. When an AEI does not reverse after the timing is set to 0.92ms, the photometric zone value AET is added with 1, and further added with 0.13ms as a TLS, and after then, it is checked up whether the AEI is reversed or not. When the AEI is still not reversed, the photometric zone value AET is further added with 1, and this is to be repeated, if necessary. In photometric zone value RET 5, for example, the AEI is reversed, the AET 5 is resultantly set. If the AEI remains unreversed as it is, the photometric zone value AET is repeatedly added up to a maximum that is in this example, 27 when using a film of not higher than ISO 100 and 34 when using a film of higher than ISO 100. Next, an SL information. i.e., a focal length information, is fed. When a short focal point detecting switch S W is switched ON, there gives a flag of SL 0 with SL 0, and, when a long focal point detecting switch S T is switched ON, there gives a flag of SL 1 with SL 1 and, in this example, the photometric zone RAM AET is shifted by 5. The binary focus lens is switched over from one to the other by shifting the table and is processed with the same RAM table. Next, a film speed zone relative to ISO speed 100 as a standard is shifted in such a manner that the RAM ISO of the ISO speed zone see Fig. 3 of a loaded film after subtracting 6 therefrom is subtracted from the RAM AET of the photometric zone. When the RAM AET of this shifted photometric zone is not more than 0 , it is to be processed as 0 , because it goes outside the table. In the abovementioned process, a photometric zone AET containing an ISO speed information and a lens information in a natural light photography may be set. Successively, a POP information, i.e., an electronic flash photographic information, is processed. When an electronic flash switch is ON, that is, SPOP 1, so as to take picture with an electronic flash, the photographying mode is in an electronic flash photographying mode SPOP 1 so that a low luminance warning lamp may not be lit. LED 0 . In an AE photographying mode SPOP 0 and when a photometric zone RAM AET is not less than 27 or the equivalent thereof that is, a shutter speed at EV8 , there makes no further photometry but makes a low luminance warning. LED 1 . Even when the photometric zone RAM AET is 24 that is, a shutter speed at EV9 or higher, or the equivalent thereto, a low luminance warning will similarly be made, provided that a taking lens is in the state of f T and LED 1 . When the second stage switch S2 of the shutter release button is switched ON in such a state as mentioned above, a proper exposure can be performed at a shutter speed TAE selected in accordance with both of the photometric zone provided by the abovementioned steps and the built in table of memorizing means 5, which is shown in Table 2. If the switch S2 cannot be switched ON, the abovementioned flow is to be repeated. In this particular example, the difference in the open apertures between the f W lens and the f T lens was set at 1 2 3EV and the steps of the table were segmented by every 1 1 3EV. It is, however, suitable that the ISO speed zones and photometric zones in a table may be graduated stepwise so as to be shifted. Next, a further description will be made in more detail about the electronic flash controlling means for the variable focas type camera, with reference to another example of the invention. Fig. 7 is a block diagram illustrating an electronic flash controlling means of the invention applied to a variable focus type camera, wherein reference numeral 70 indicates a film speed reading circuit for reading an ISO speed information from a film cartridge for DX system film use 71 is a distance measuring unit for feeding an information corresponding to a distance from a camera to a subject 72 indicates the switches each for a focal length corresponding to the microswitch S W or S T shown in Fig. 1 b 73 indicates a photometering unit comprising CdS or the like for putting out a subject brightness information 74 indicates a controller comprising a microcomputer capable of computing both a shutter speed from a shutter opening command to a shutter closing command and the value of a flash timing from the shutter opening command to an electronic flash starting command, and also capable of giving both a shutter closing signal and an electronic flash emitting signal, in accordance with the aforementioned ISO speed information, a distance to subject information, a focal length information, and a subject brightness information 75 indicates a table memory stored the relations between ISO speeds and flash timings, in the form of a table 76 indicates an electronic flash circuit and 77 indicates a shutter driver for driving an electromagnetically driven shutter 78. A distance to be measured by distance measuring unit 71 from a lens to a subject is segmented into a plurality of AF zones, e.g., 15 AF zones. Accordingly, table memory 75 stores in advance a table showing the relations between the AF zones and the flash timing values denoted by ms for every ISO speed index, as shown in Table 5, that is another example of the tables to be stored, exhibiting the flash timing values for an f W lens, in which the EFISO zones in the left column are segmented stepwise by every 1 3EV. EV means an exposure value . The flash timing values each shown in this table are the values produced by controller 74. As for one of the examples, the controller 74 will count the time from the point of time when a shutter opening signal is given so that an electronic flashing command may be given with a timing shown in the table. When the ISO speed index of a film used is automatically read by a film speed reading circuit 70, a distance to a subject is measured by distance measuring unit 71, and a focal length information is given from a focal length information generating switch 72 on which lens is being used, a short focus lens f W or a long focus lens f T , controller 74 starts to read a corresponding flash timing value from the built in flash timing table of the table memory 75. For example, in the case that a short focus lens f W and a film of ISO speed 400 are used to take picture of a subject at a distance corresponding to AF zone 5, a flash timing value of 15.6ms is selected to send an electronic flash signal at that timing to electronic flash circuit 76, so that an electronic flash may be fired. When switching the taking lens over to a long focus lens f T to take picture of the same subject, a signal to that effect is given from the focal length information generating switch 72. The open aperture of the taking lens is F 3.3 in the case of the short focus lens f W and F 5.8 in the case of the long focus lens f T , and the taking lens is therefore darkened by 1 2 3EV in terms of EV value. Accordingly, controller 74 will shift an ISO speed index on the flash timing table shown in Table 5 to the direction of 5 steps lower in the EFISO zone. In the abovementioned example, 22.6ms of the flash timing value that corresponds to 125 of the ISO speed index is read and, at this timing, an electronic flash signal is sent. As mentioned above, when switching a taking lens over between a short focus lens f W and a long focal point f T , a proper exposure can be obtained by only shifting a flash timing value to the direction that an ISO speed is changed by the equivalent to the difference between the open aperture values. The above description is concerned with a camera capable of switching the two focal lengths thereof over from one to the other. Also, in a camera capable of switching between two or more focal lengths thereof, however, a proper exposure can be performed, regardless of the changes in the focal lengths of a taking lens, by shifting a film speed table of the corresponding relations to the changes of the open aperture of a taking lens between an ISO speed index and a electronic flash timing value. According to this invention, even in a variable focus type camera using a programmed shutter, the memorizing means thereof does not need to store a number of tables indiscriminately and, in addition, a proper exposure can be performed in any conditions of a selected long or short focal point lens, and a proper flash timing in electronic flash photography.
