# COMPRESSOR.

## Abstract
A compressor which comprises a rotor 16 in which vanes 14 are slidably provided, a cylinder 11 containing the rotor 16 and the vanes 14 , and side plates 21 se cured to both side surfaces of the cylinder 11 . In this compressor, a suction passage isolation zone 19 is advan tageously formed in a suction passage provided by vane chambers 26a, 26b to a coolant supply side. Thus, a rotary compressor is provided in which there is no loss of re frigerating capacity during low speed running, and which can effectively restrain the refrigerating capacity only during high speed running.
