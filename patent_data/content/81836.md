## Description
DescriptionUse of the compound 9 p N methylacetamido anilino 7 methyl 1H imidazo 4,5 f quinoline hydrochloride I as antitumor agent.This invention is concerned with the use of the compound 9 EP N methylacetamido anilino 7 methyl IH imidazo 4,5 f quinoline hydrochloride I for preparing parenterally injectable solutions for treating malignant tumors in a host afflicted therewith. That compound is described in U.S. patent No. 3,878,206 wherein its utility as an anti bacterial agent is disclosed.It has now been found that I possesses noteworthy antitumor activity. Such activity is evinced in those systems currently regarded and acknowledged by those skilled in the art to unearth candidates for successful use as antitumor agents and to be reasonable predictors of such use in a variety of species.Such systems comprise murine tumors such as P 388 lymphocytic leukemia, B 16 melanocarcinoma and L 1210 lymphoid leukemia Cancer Clinical Trials, 1979 2 195 216 Recent Results in Cancer Research, Vol. 70. It has been discovered that when I is administered parenterally as a solution in isotonic saline to a host harboring one of the aforecited tumors, a salutary effect is elicited. The results are depicted in the following table Antitumor Activitya L 1210 P 388 B 16 Limphoid Leukemiab Lymphocytic Leukemiab MelanocarcinomabDosec ILSd T Ce T Cf Dosec ILSd T Ce T Cf Dosec ILSd T Ce T Cf 50 43 143 2.3 50 46 146 3.0 50 49 149 0.7 12.5 25 125 1.9 25 43 143 1.0 25 98 198 0.4 12.5 34 134 0.8 50 84 184 2.3 6.25 26 126 0.8 a.
