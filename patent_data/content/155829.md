## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device in which an improvement is made in a decoder portion including spare decoders. Particularly, the present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device in which if a fault occurs in a memory cell connected to a normal decoder, the decoder connected with the faulty memory cell is separated to be in a non selective state and a spare decoder in place thereof is brought into a selective state to be substituted for the above stated normal decoder, using a laser program system. Description of the Prior Art A semiconductor memory device, integrated to a high degree according to the recent trend, is generally provided with spare memory cells and spare decoders connected to the spare memory cells, so that even if a fault is caused in a part of memory cells in the manufacturing process thereof, the device as a whole can be protected from malfunctioning due to such fault. More specifically stated, such a semiconductor memory device is in a so called redundancy structure in which if a fault is detected in a certain normal memory cell, a normal decoder connected therewith is separated to be in a non selective state and a spare decoder is brought into a selective state in place of the normal decoder. In a memory device of such a redundancy structure, a laser program system is often adopted as a method for operating a spare memory cell by separating the normal decoder concerned and bringing a spare decoder into a selective state in case where a fault is detected in a normal memory cell. In such a laser program system, a laser beam is applied to specified link elements, whereby the normal decoder associated is separated and a spare decoder is brought into a selective state. For example, in Laser Programmable Redundancy and Yield Improvement in a 64K DRAM by R.T. Smith et al. in IEEE J. Solid State Circuits, vol. SC 16, pp. 506 513, Oct. 1981, a semiconductor memory device of a redundancy structure to which a laser program system is applicable is described. This document indicates, as factors constituting obstacles to accurate application of a laser beam to link elements, the following three points In A Low Power Sub 100ns 256K Bit Dynamic RAM by S. Fujii et al. in IEEE J. Solid State Circuits, vol. SC 18, pp. 441 445, Oct. 1983, an example of a semiconductor memory device of a redundancy structure using a laser program system is disclosed. The device disclosed in this document does not comprise link elements for each word line so as to be adapted for a high degree of integration however, this device involves demerits such as slow speed of operation. In A 256K Dynamic RAM with Page Nibble Mode by K. Fujishima et al. in IEEE J. Solid State Circuits, vol. SC 18, pp. 470 478, Oct. 1983, the prior art of most interest to the present invention is disclosed. For the purpose of clarifying the essential feature of the present invention, the art described in this document will be described concretely and briefly with reference to Figs. 1 to 4. Fig. 1 is a plan view illustrating a typical structure of a semiconductor memory device. Referring to Fig. 1, a semiconductor memory device comprises memory cell array portions 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d and a decoder portion 2 associated with the memory cell array portions 1a to 1d. To the semiconductor memory device, an external reference signal The above stated specified circuit group is structured by, for example, an Fig. 2 is a detailed plan view illustrating the array portions 1a to 1d and the decoder portion 2. The array portions 1a to 1d include a plurality of word lines represented by the dotted lines extending horizontally and a plurality of bit lines represented by the solid lines extending vertically and intersecting orthogonally with the word lines. On the respective points of intersection between the word lines and the bit lines, memory cells not shown are disposed. The decoder portion 2 includes a plurality of column decoders aligned horizontally and a plurality of row decoders aligned vertically. The column decoders include j normal column decoders 1 to j and a spare column decoder S1 on the left in the drawing and a spare decoder S2 and j normal column decoders j 1 to 2j on the right, j being an integer number. From the respective column decoders, two pairs of bit lines BL The row decoders aligned vertically include k normal decoders 1 to k and a spare decoder S1 on the upper side and a spare decoder S2 and k normal decoders k 1 to 2k on the lower side, k being an integer number. From the respective row decoders, two word lines WL Referring to Fig. 2, description will be made by taking the right, upper array portion 1c as an example. Now, assuming that a fault is detected in one of the memory cells disposed on the word line WL In the following, a concrete circuit structure of a decoder will be described by taking an example of a row decoder. Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of a normal row decoder for selecting word lines WL Referring to Fig. 3, a row decoder circuit is structured by a combination of MOS transistors, so that a word line is selected according to a signal applied thereto. The reference characters 11a, 11b, 11c and 11d denote link elements inserted in the respective word lines and by melting these link elements, an electrically discontinuous state is established. If a fault is found in a memory cell selected by and one of the word lines WL Fig. 4 shows a spare row decoder circuit to be substituted for the normal row decoder in a non selective state in association with a faulty memory cell. Referring to Fig. 4, all the 2n address signals A₁, However, in such a redundancy structure as described above, link elements 11a to 11d provided in a normal row decoder circuit for separating a word line associated with a faulty memory cell bringing it into a non selective state are required for each word line. Accordingly, the distribution density of link elements becomes large and disadvantages are involved that the requirements for the positioning precision of a laser beam or the effective beam diameter at the time of melting link elements are too strict and sometimes it becomes practically impossible to melt link elements. EP A 2 0095721 discloses a semiconductor memory device comprising a plurality of memory cells for storing binary signals, a plurality of decoders connected to said memory cells for selecting said connected memory cells, said decoders including normal decoders and a spare decoder, precharge signal providing means connected respectively to said plurality of decoders for providing a precharge signal to each of said decoders, whereby said decoders are brought into a selective state, address signal providing means connected respectively to said decoders by a plurality of address signal lines for providing address signals for selecting specifically said decoders, and link elements adapted to be melted so as to permit selective disabling of said normal decoders. Furthermore DE 3028778 discloses a decoder system comprising a latch for clamping a wordline to a predetermined voltage level. The present invention aims to overcome such disadvantages as described above and aims to provide a semiconductor memory device of a redundancy structure suited for a high degree of integration, in which the requirements for the positioning precision of a laser beam and the effective beam diameter for melting link elements can be made less severe. In order to achieve the above aims, a redundancy structure is applied in which a link element is inserted in an input line for an According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device as defined by claim 1 hereinbelow. Consequently, if the signal level of an output line of an unselected decoder circuit is prevented from becoming high for any reason, the signal level is clamped at a prescribed value by the latching means. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device as defined by claim 5 hereinbelow. Therefore, in the present invention, the distribution density of the link elements to be melted by a laser beam is low compared with that of a conventional redundancy structure where link elements are provided for each word line or each bit line for selecting a memory cell. Accordingly, the requirements for the positioning precision of a laser beam or the effective beam diameter for melting link elements can be made less severe, and a redundancy structure of a laser program system is made applicable to a semiconductor memory device having large scale integration. In the semiconductor memory device of the present invention, the operational speed originally desired is maintained, since only the structure of link elements is different from that of a conventional device. In addition, since the distribution density of link elements is reduced, the link elements can be arranged more easily. These features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a normal decoder circuit provided in an embodiment of the Present invention and Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram showing a spare decoder circuit provided in an embodiment of the present invention. The decoder circuits shown in Figs. 5 and 6 correspond to the decoder circuits shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Accordingly, the same or like portions in Figs. 5 and 6 are denoted by the same reference characters as in Figs. 3 and 4. Referring to Fig. 5, in the normal row decoder circuit, a link element 11p which can be melted by a laser beam is connected in series with a transistor 13 for precharging an output line 12. More specifically, the link element 11p is inserted in a precharge bus 31 which connects the transistor 13 and the output line 12. In addition to transistors T₁ to T With such structure as described above, a normal row decoder in an embodiment of the present invention makes it possible to decrease the distribution density of link elements as compared with a conventional row decoder, circuit. More specifically, in the structure of a normal row decoder, only one link element is provided in a precharge bus instead of the link elements provided for each word line and, as a result, the distribution density of link elements can be reduced considerably from that of a conventional device. Accordingly, the distance between the respective link elements can be made large. Fig. 6 shows a spare row decoder circuit to be employed in an embodiment of the present invention. The spare row decoder circuit shown in Fig. 6 has a structure in which a link element 11p is provided in a precharge bus 31 instead of the link elements 11a to 11d provided for each word line in the conventional spare row decoder circuit shown in Fig. 4. The remaining structure is the same as conventional spare row decoder. For the purpose of facilitating the understanding of the operation of the circuits shown in Figs. 5 and 6 to be described below, a concrete circuit structure of the delay and inversion circuits 8 and 9 see Figs. 1 for providing the Fig. 8 is a circuit diagram showing a concrete structure of the delay and inversion circuit 8 see Fig. 1 . This delay and inversion circuit receives an Referring to Fig. 8, the reference numerals 41 to 55 denote MOS transistors and the reference numerals 56 and 57 denote capacitors. The reference numerals 201 to 207 denote node numbers. Generally, in a circuit of this kind, the ON resistance in the transistor 46 is set to a value ten times or more than ten times that of the transistor 47 and the ON resistance of the transistor 50 is set to a value ten times of more than ten times that of the transistor 51. Now, let us assume that the Then, when the RX signal attains the high level, the transistors 42 and 43 are turned into the ON state and the transistor 44 is turned into the OFF state. As a result, the node 202 attains the high level and the transistors 53 and 55 are turned into the ON state. At the same time, the potential in the node 207 is discharged and the transistor 54 is turned into the OFF state. Accordingly, the In other words, the delay time after the high level of the RX signal till the low level of the On the other hand, when the Subsequently, when the node 202 attains the low level and the transistor 47 is turned into the OFF state, the potential in the node 204 increases. This increase of potential is transmitted to the node 203 through the capacitor 56 and, by a so called bootstrap effect causing the potential of the node 203 to be higher than V Fig. 9 shows an example of a concrete circuit structure of the delay and inversion circuit 9 see Fig. 1 . This delay and inversion circuit 9 provides an RXDD signal which rises with a delay after the rise of the Referring to Fig. 9, the reference numerals 61 to 71 denote MOS transistors and the reference numerals 72 and 73 denote capacitors. The RAS signal is an inverted signal of the When the After that, when the Thus, the Now, the operation of the circuits shown in Figs. 5 and 6 will be described with reference to the waveform diagram of Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the broken lines represent waveforms of the operation after the link element 11p of a normal row decoder circuit associated with a faulty memory cell has been melted. Referring mainly to Figs. 5 and 7, the operation in the normal state of the memory cells selected by a word line connected to a normal row decoder circuit will be first described. In a period where the Now, assuming that a fault is detected in a memory cell selected by a word line of a normal row decoder circuit as shown in FIg. 5. In this case, the link element 11p is melted by a laser beam so that the On the other hand, also in a row decoder circuit connected with normal memory cells, the terminal 15 of the clamp circuit 14 is brought to the high level 95 from the low level 94 by the RXDD signal after decoding of the input address signals A In this case, the RXDD signal is provided by applying inversion and delay to the Substitution of the spare row decoder circuit shown in Fig. 7 for the normal row decoder circuit connected with a faulty memory cell is performed in the same manner as in the previously described conventional circuit and, therefore, the description thereof is omitted. Although in the foregoing embodiment, an example of a row decoder circuit was described, it goes without saying that the present invention can also be applied to the column decoder circuits. Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.
