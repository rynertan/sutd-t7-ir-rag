# Optical reader for bar coded labels.

## Abstract
A circular scan reader utilizes oscillating mirrors 34, 36 and associated optics 22, 24 to generate a circular scan pat tern of laser light focused to a small spot. The angle of the scan emanating from a point just inside the reader through a win dow 21 forms a conical shape which permits scanning inside a yarn tube 10 without inserting any portion of the reader into the tube. When the scan passes over a bar coded label 12 , the changes in reflection of light between the bars 12a and spaces 12b are detected by a photodetector 38 mounted on the face of the window 21 . These fluctuations in light which correspond in width to the bar and space width are con verted to an electrical signal that is amplified, and decoded. A driver circuit 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 34, 35 for the oscillating mir rors controls the scan rate and scan pattern. The scan rate is modulated to cause a variation in the sweep depth in the tube thus providing an area scan. The area scan reduces the need for accurate label placement in the tube core.
