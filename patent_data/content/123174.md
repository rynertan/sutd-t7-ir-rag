# Television system.

## Abstract
A television system employing the sequential scanning system wherein picture information obtained by sequential scanning at a scanning frequency twice that of the standard system is separated into the first field information consisting of odd numbered lines and the second field information con sisting of even numbered lines, and the separated field informations are stored in respective memory devices 32, 33 . The first and second field informations stored in the memory devices are transmitted separately by a transmitter 8 . The first and second field informations received by the reception system are stored in separate memory devices 41, 42 . The first and second field informations are read out from the memory devices in the order of the odd numbered line and then the even numbered line at a speed twice the writing speed, and the read out line information is displayed on a display device 19 which scans sequentially the screen at a scanning frequency twice that of the standard system.
