# Improved air separation process with turbine exhaust desuperheat.

## Abstract
An improved air separation process wherein a stream which is warmed to provide temperature control for a reversing heat exchanger and is expanded to generate plant refrigeration is desuperheated before being introduced to a low pressure distillation column. The process is particularly useful when argon is a desired product of the air separation.
