# AN ELECTROPLATED PLASTICS OBJECT AND A PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF

## Abstract
The present invention provides an electroplated plas tics object that will withstand severe conditions without the electrodeposit separating from the substrate. It comprises a substrate of directly plateable plastics material on top of which is electrodeposited successively i a nickel based alloy layer consisting of either 5 to 50 iron and 0 to 20 cobalt or 10 to 60 cobalt, the balance being nickel which must be at least 50 in the iron containing alloy, ii a layer of pure nickel or of nickel cobalt alloy, and iii a layer of chromium. Further intermediate layers may also be included.
