# A fluid operated pump.

## Abstract
A fluid operated reciprocating pump comprises a central housing 80 , a pair of chamber housings 40,60 attached to opposite sides of the central housing, and a pumping diaphragm 55,75 in each chamber housing that separates an inner pressure chamber 57,77 from an outer pressure chamber 56,76 . Each outer pressure chamber is connected to an inlet manifold 43,63 and a discharge manifold 44,64 , and one way check valves 25,26 control the flow of the material being pumped through the chambers. The pumping diaphragms 55,75 are connected together by a connecting rod 101 that extends through the central housing. The central housing defines inlet and outlet ports 85,86 for operating fluid, a reversing valve chamber 89 , a pilot valve chamber 95 , and passages 97,98,91,92,93,94 connecting the reversing valve chamber to the pilot valve chamber, the inlet port, the outlet port and the inner pressure chambers 57,77 . A reversing valve 90 is slidably mounted in the reversing valve chamber 89 to control the supply of operating fluid to alternate from one inner chamber to the other, and a pilot valve 96 is slidably mounted in the pilot valve chamber to control the movement of the reversing valve 90 . The pilot valve is controlled by a pair of pivotally mounted lever assemblies 110,120 engaged and pivoted by the connecting rod 101 and located within the central housing, each lever assembly 110,120 comprising one lever arm 114,124 which is engagable by means 118 on the connecting rod 101 and another arm 115,125 which is arranged to engage an end of the pilot valve 96 .
