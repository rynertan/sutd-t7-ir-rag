# Size reducible container.

## Abstract
A size reducible tear strip type rectangular column like container for contents such as icecream and margarine is formed from a pre patterned blank A of carton board. In the assembled state, a plurality of gripping portions 7a,b... use ful in tear stripping respective sections project from a corner. A plurality of tear lines formed by paired horizontally extend ing and closely adjacent external and internal straight score lines 1a,b,c..., 2a,b,c... formed to depths of about one half of the thickness of the blank define the sections of the container to be torn and stripped off progressively from the remaining sections. Oblique tear lines similarly formed by partial depth score lines 4a,b,c...,5a,b,c... facilitate the start of the removal of each section. This structure provides a container which is easily formed but which hinders leakage of material.
