## Description
The present invention relates to a current regulating circuit especially adaptable for integrated circuit manufacture, and more particularly, to a battery charging circuit that may be fabricated as a relatively small solid state component and incorporated directly in a cordless tool or appliance, thereby obviating the use of a cumbersome, bulky and expensive external charger utilizing a conventional transformer. While not restricted thereto, this invention finds immediate application in simple, inexpensive battery charging circuits which are especially useful for charging batteries used in portable battery operated devices such as soldering pencils, shavers, cordless telephones, calculators, computers, television sets, radios, recorders, electric garden tools, cordless hand tools including woodworking and metalworking tools, and the like. More particularly, the present invention finds direct application in battery charging circuits for cordless devices which are simple, inexpensive to make and may be readily incorporated directly into the cordless devices. Battery operated cordless devices, such as hand tools, have a considerable popularity because of the convenience afforded by these devices. Devices of this type are customarily provided with a small D.C. electric drive motor which is energized by one or more rechargeable batteries incorporated within the tool housing and operatively associated with the electric drive motor. When the device is a television set, radio, recorder or the like, the rechargeable batteries supply D.C. power to the circuits therein either exclusively or alternatively, in instances in which an A.C. power cord and plug are provided. The elimination of a conventional electric cord or its alternative use increases the freedom with which the user of the cordless device can move about, eliminating the inconveniences of clearing the power cord from obstacles with which it may otherwise become entangled and reducing the necessity of having electric wall outlets available at every place the device is to be used. It has become customary to provide cordless devices, such as cordless garden tools and woodworking tools with rechargeable batteries so as to avoid the necessity of frequent battery replacements, and to reduce the cost of operation. The present day rechargeable batteries, properly maintained with a special charge, have an extended life and greatly enhanced convenience with which the cordless device may be operated. Most cordless devices, such as cordless hand tools and the like, operate from a D.C. battery potential of only a few volts. The prior art has resorted to recharging the batteries from a conventional 117 volt, 60 Hz electrical outlet through voltage stepped down transformers which necessarily are of considerable size and consequently increase the size, cost and weight of the battery charger. Different outlet voltage levels and or supply frequencies are also encountered. The size and weight of the battery charger, and particularly the contribution to the weight by the step down transformer, has made it difficult to incorporate a charging circuit directly into cordless devices and to make such a charger inexpensively. Moreover, the handling, storage and packaging of battery chargers involving transformers result in serious shortcomings and limitation on their use, particularly if desired to be incorporated in the cordless device itself. Moreover, the customer and user of a variety of cordless tools, appliances or devices will accumulate an equal variety of separable chargers, and some confusion may result in determining which charger is to be used with a particular cordless device. It is known from U.S. Letters Patent no. 3,943,423 to Philip A. Hoffman entitled Battery Charging Circuit and issued on March 9, 1976 to provide a battery charging circuit which eliminates the need for a relatively bulky and heavy voltage step down transformer, and which, when recharging batteries in a hand tool or the like, needs simply to be connected to a conventional, 117 volt 60 Hz household outlet and to the battery cell or cells which are to be recharged. Here again, other outlet voltage levels and or supply frequencies can be used as well. The known charging circuit of the aforesaid Hoffman patent comprises a variable resistance switch preferably realized in the form of a NPN junction transistor and Darlington connected other transistors operatively associated with a feedback circuit. This known circuit has, in addition to the transistors and resistors, two rectifying diodes and two capacitors, resulting in a circuit which, particularly because of the need for the capacitors and a considerable number of passive components, becomes relatively more expensive to realize as an integrated circuit than the present invention and would be somewhat bulky and more expensive to miniaturize than the present invention using other techniques for incorporation into cordless devices. It is known from the further U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,970,912 issued on July 20, 1976 to Philip A. Hoffman and entitled Battery Charging Circuit to provide a battery charging circuit free of transformers and operatively arranged to produce current pulses which are supplied to the battery or batteries to be recharged via the inductance of an electric motor, which forms part of a cordless hand tool or the like. This circuit, while not requiring capacitors, does require at least two diodes and an inductance, albeit the inductance of an electric motor which is a portion of a powered hand tool or the like. As a result, this circuit has somewhat limited utility because of the requirement for an inductance, and, in particular, the inductance provided by a D.C. electric motor. A considerable number of battery chargers have been proposed and are known from the general prior art including U.S. letters Patents identified as follows It is also known from Mims III Engineer s Notebook A Handbook of Integrated Circuit Appications , First Edition, Second Printing, pg. 95, Radio Shack, A division of the Tandy Corporation, U.S.A. 1979 to use integrated circuits in battery charges.

Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a cordless, battery operated hand tool in the form of a grass clippers 10 for the purpose of illustration.

Figs. 2, 3, 4A and 4B, and 5A and 5B are respective detailed circuit diagrams of respective embodiments of battery charging circuit constructed according to the present invention and which are readily adapted to be incorporated into the housing 12 of the grass clippers 10 illustrated in Fig. 1. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the illustrative, first embodiment of a charging circuit constructed in accordance with the present invention is generally designated by the numeral 19 and includes a pair of terminals 20, 21 which are shown, for purposes of illustration, connected across a conventional, 117 volt 60 Hz voltage source 22. Also shown in Fig. 2 is an electric motor 23 and a motor energizing battery 24. The motor 23, may be for example, a small printed magnet electric motor having an armature 25 with inductive windings, shown generally by the numeral 26, to which electrical connections are established by motor brushes 27, 28. The battery 24 may be comprised of four conventional 1.3 volt nickle cadmium rechargeable battery cells in series to provide a battery voltage of approximately 5.2 volts when fully charged. The battery charging circuit designated generally by the numeral 19 is connectable to the battery 24 by a single pole, double throw, manually operated switch 29 having a movable contact 30 for selective engagement with a stationary contact 31 which, when brought into contact with the movable contact 30 as illustrated, places the battery 24 in a recharging position. When the movable contact 30 is moved to engage its associated stationary contact 32, the battery charging circuit 19 is taken out of circuit with the battery 24, which is then in its operate position, the battery 24 energizing the motor 24. The basic charging circuit 19, as illustrated in Fig. 2, can be used to charge, for example, both 2.6 volt and 5.2 volt nickle cadmium batteries from conventional 117 volt, and 234 volt 60 Hz power sources. It is to be appreciated, however, that the charging circuit illustrated in Fig. 2 can be utilized to charge rechargeable batteries of considerably different voltage levels from sources of different levels and or supply frequencies, the above mentioned levels and frequencies being set out by way of example only. The battery charging circuit 19 includes, a first resistor 33 resistance R₁ , a second resistor 34 resistance R₂ , a third resistor 35 resistance R₃ and a rectifying diode 36 connected between the stationary contact 31 of the switch 29 and the terminal 20 of the battery charging circuit. As illustrated, the rectifying diode 36 has its anode connected to the terminal 20 and its cathode connected to one end of the resistor 35. A fourth resistor 37 resistance R₄ is connected between the connection point of the second resistor 34 and the third resistor 35 and the collector of an NPN transistor 38, which has its emitter connected to the stationary contact 31 of the manually operated switch 29 and to one end of the first resistor 33. The other end of the first resistor 33 is connected to the base of the transistor 38, as well as to one end of the second resistor 34. The transistor 38 and resistors 33, 34 35 and 37 constitute the control stage of the battery charging circuit 19. The collector of the transistor 38 is connected, in turn, to a current amplifier which includes a Darlington connected series of NPN junction transistors 39 42. The Darlington connected transistors are selected so as to provide a relatively high current gain, for example, a current gain β₂ of approximately 200,000, while the control stage which includes the transistor 38 is selected to also have a current gain β₁ , for example, of about 100. The collectors of each of the transistors 39 42 are connected to the cathode of the rectifying diode 36. The base of the first of the transistors 39 42, that is the transistor 39 is connected to the collector of the switching transistor 38. The emitter of the final one of the Darlington connected transistors 39 42, that is the transistor 42, is connected to the stationary contact 31 of the manually operated switch 29 and to the emitter of the transistor 38, via a current limiting fifth resistor 43 R₅ . The current limiting fifth resistor 45 is a positive temperature coefficient PTC resistance, formed by metallization from materials which are selected so that this resistor will also function as a fuse, allowing circuit failure without change to the battery undergoing recharging and endangering the surroundings. The battery charging circuit 19 illustrated in Fig. 2, is not provided with external feedback between the output of the current amplifier constituted by the Darlington circuit configured transistors 39 42 and the switching transistor 38 however, internal feedback is provided by the third resistance 35 because of its coupling to the base of the transistor 38 via the second resistance 34 and the first resistance 33 connected as illustrated. By way of example only, typical values for circuit parameters of the battery charging circuit illustrated in Fig. 2, which would be used in an exemplary integrated circuit embodiment are It is to be appreciated that the individual values for the resistances R₁ R₄ can vary considerably, as a practical matter by about 20 percent, the exact values for resistances R₁ R₄ not being nearly as important as the ratios among them. The ratios of R₁ R₄, R₂ R₄ and R₃ R₄, in a practical case, should desirably be within the range of substantially 5 percent and preferably substantially 1 percent. These criteria make it possible to realize the charging circuit of Fig. 2 as an integrated circuit using diffusion techniques. It is conceived that the integrated circuit, in an exemplary practical realization can be contained within a small housing preferably of cylindrical shape and having a length of about 3 16 inch and a diameter of about 5 36 inch. Two concentric wire leads each of about one inch can be provided to extend from the housing. Accordingly, expressing the above mentioned ratios as constants K₁, K₂ and K₃, respectively, we have and or, as the preferred case is, The fifth resistance R₅ need not be in a particular ratio with respect to the other resistances and can readily be formed by metallization and be constituted by a metal contact to or between circuit points. The resistance R₅ is desirably a positive temperature coefficient PTC resistance, which increases in value as temperature increases, thus limiting current flow. The size of resistance R₅, relative to the sizes of resistance R₁ R₄, is very small. The resistance R₅ acts to stabilize the battery charging circuit which, in a practical case, operates at a temperature of about 125 C during battery charging when the chip is provided with a suitable thermal mounting. Charging current will decrease with an increase in ambient temperature of approximately forty five hundredths of one percent 0.45 per degree Centigrade, roughly matching the desired change in nickle cadmium cell charging current with temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 3, like reference numerals designating like circuit components, the illustrative, second embodiment of a charging circuit constructed in accordance with the present invention is generally designated by the numeral 47 and includes a pair of terminals 20, 21 which are shown, for purposes of illustration, connected across a conventional, 117 volt, 60 Hz voltage source 22. Also shown in Fig. 3 is an electric motor 23 and a motor energizing battery 24. The motor 23, may be, for example, a small permanent magnet electric motor having an armature 25 with inductive windings 26 to which electrical connections are established by motor brushes 27, 28. The battery 24 may be comprised of conventional rechargeable battery cells in series. The battery charging circuit designated generally by the numeral 47 is connectable to the battery 24 by a single pole, double throw, manually operated switch 29 having a movable contact 30 for selective engagement with a stationary contact 31 which, when brought into contact with the movable contact 30 as illustrated, places the battery 24 in a recharging position. When the movable contact 30 is moved to engage its associated stationary contact 32, the battery charging circuit 47 is taken out of circuit with the battery 24, which is then in its operate position, the battery 24 energizing the motor 24. The basic charging circuit 47, as illustrated in Fig. 3, can be used to charge both 2.6 volt and 5.2 volt nickle cadmium batteries from 117 volt, 60 Hz power supplies from 234 volt, 60Hz power supplies. It is to be appreciated, however, that the charging circuit illustrated in Fig. 3 can be utilized to charge rechargeable batteries of considerably different voltage levels and itself have different levels and or supply frequency, the above mentioned levels and frequency being set out by way of example only. The battery charging circuit 47 includes, a first resistor 48 resistance R ₁ , a second resistor 49 resistance R ₂ and a third resistor 50 resistance R ₃ , which is included to provide internal feedback, in series with a rectifying diode 36 connected between the stationary contact 31 of the switch 29, via a current limiting further resistor 52 resistance R ₅ and the terminal 20 of the battery charging circuit. As illustrated, the rectifying diode 36 has its anode connected to the terminal 20 and its cathode connected to one end of the third resistor 50. A fourth resistor 51 resistance R ₄ is connected between the connection of the second resistor 49 and the third resistor 50 and the collector of the NPN transistor 38, which has its emitter connected to the stationary contact 31 of the manually operated switch 29 and, via the fifth resistor 52, to one end of the first resistor 48, which has its other end connected to the base of the transistor 38, as well as to one end of the second resistor 49. The transistor 38 and the resistors 48 52 constitute the control stage of the battery charging circuit 47. The collector of the transistor 38 is connected, in turn, to a Darlington configured series of NPN junction transistors 39 42. The Darlington configured transistors 39 42 are selected so as to provide a relatively high current gain, for example, a current gain β₂ of approximately 200,000, while the transistor 38 of the control stage is selected to also have in circuit a relatively high current gain β₁ , for example, a gain of about 100. The collectors of each of the transistors 39 42 are connected to the cathode of the rectifying diode 36. The base of the first of the transistors 39 42, that is the transistor 39, is connected to the collector of the transistor 38. The emitter of the final one of the Darlington connected, current amplifying transistors 39 42, that is the transistor 42, is connected to the stationary contact 31 of the manually operated switch 29 and to the emitter of the control transistor 38, via the fifth resistor 52. The battery charging circuit 47 illustrated in Fig. 3, is provided with external feedback between the output of the amplifier constituted by the Darlington circuit configured transistors 39 42 and the switching transistor 38 via the fifth resistor 51 which has its end not connected to the stationary contact 31 connected to that end of the first resistor 48 which is not connected to the base of the transistor 38. Additional internal feedback is provided, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2, by virtue of the third resistor 50 resistor 35, Fig. 2 because of its coupling to the base of the transistor 38, as illustrated. Again, by way of example only, typical values for circuit parameters of the battery charging circuit illustrated in Fig. 3, which could be used in an integrated circuit embodiment are As in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2, the individual values for the resistances R ₁ R ₄ of the circuit illustrated in Fig. 3 can vary considerably, as a practical matter by about 20 percent, the exact values for resistances R ₁ R ₄ not being as important as the ratios among them. The ratios of R ₁ R ₄, R ₂ R ₄ and R ₃ R₄, in a practical case should desireably be within the range of substantially 5 percent and preferably substantially 1 percent. These criteria make it possible to realize the charging circuit of Fig. 3 as an integrated circuit using diffusion techniques, the same dimensional characteristics mentioned in conjunction with the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2 applying equally well to this embodiment. Accordingly, expressing the above mentioned ratios as constants K ₁, K ₂ and K ₃, respectively, we have and or, as the prefered case is The resistance R ₅ need not be in a particular ratio with respect to the other resistances and can easily be formed by metallization and be constituted by a metal contact to or between circuit points. As in the case of Fig. 2, the resistance R₅ is desirably, a positive temperature coeffecient PTC resistance, which increases in value as the temperature increases, thus limiting the current flow and serving to stabilize the circuit which in a practical integrated circuit version may operate at a chip temperature of about 125 C during battery charging when the chip is provided with a suitable thermal mounting. The PTC resistor 52 R ₅ is preferably formed by metallization with materials which are selected so that the resistor will also function as a fuse, allowing the circuit to fail without damaging the battery undergoing charging and endangering the surroundings. Charging current will decrease with an increase in ambient temperature of approximately 1 4 percent per degree Fahrenheit, roughly matching the desired change in nickle cadmium cell charging current with temperature. In operation, the respective circuit arrangements shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are placed in operation by connecting the charging circuit 19 Fig. 2 or charging circuit 47 Fig. 3 to the voltage source 22 which is shown as connected between the input terminals 20,21 of the charging circuit 19 or the charging circuit 47. The battery 24 to be charged is connected between the terminal 21 and the stationary contact 31 its voltage being illustrated in Figs. 6A and 6B as E Referring again to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the diode 36 provides a source of input current for the Darlington configured current amplifier defined by the transistors 39 42, as well as operating voltage for the switching transistor 38 of the control stage. Initially, relatively high current spikes are produced, causing the PTC resistor 43 Fig. 2 or the PTC resistor 52 Fig. 3 to increase in value, because of heating thereof resulting in the current spikes having lesser magnitudes as they approach the 5.0 ampere level and the chip achieves its stable operating temperature of about 125 C. Thereafter, when the A.C. voltage e₁ of the source 22 is positive and slightly greater, for example less than 2.6 volts with respect to the battery potential E It is to be appreciated that were a 234 Volt, 60 H In operation, the external feedback provided by the fifth resistor 52 Fig. 3 as connected and the internal feedback provided by the third resistor 50 Fig. 3 or the third resistor 35 Fig. 2 as connected can be considered, in effect, to vary the resistance of the control stage and cause the transistor 38 to limit current flow in the transistor 39 42 to periods when relatively low voltages are present and to, in effect, turn the transistors 39 42 off during times higher voltages are present. As illustrated in Figs. 4A and 4B, the illustrative, third embodiment of a charging circuit constructed in accordance with the present invention is very similar to the circuit of Fig. 2 and thus is also generally designated by the numeral 19 and includes a pair of terminals 20, 21 which are shown, for purposes of illustration, connected across a conventional, 117 volt 60 Hz voltage source 22. Also shown in Figs. 4A and 4B is an electric motor 23 and a motor energizing battery 24. The motor 23 and the battery 24 may be identical to the motor 23 and battery 24 of Figs. 2 and 3. The battery charging circuit designated generally by the numeral 19 is connectable to the battery 24 by a single pole, double throw, manually operated switch 29 having a movable contact 30 for selective engagement with a stationary contact 31 which, when brought into contact with the movable contact 30 is illustrated, places the battery 24 in a recharging position. When the movable contact 30 is moved to engage its associated stationary contact 32, the battery charging circuit 19 is taken out of circuit with the battery 24, which is then in its operate position, the battery 24 energizing the motor 24. The basic charging circuit 19, as illustrated in Figs. 4A and 4B, can be used to charge batteries from conventional 117 volt, and 234 volt 60 Hz power sources. It is to be appreciated, however, that the charging circuit illustrated in Figs. 4A and 4B can be utilized to charge rechargeable batteries of considerably different voltage levels from sources of different levels and or supply frequencies, the above mentioned levels and frequencies being set out by way of example only. The battery charging circuit 19 includes, a first resistor 33 By way of example only, typical values for circuit parameters of the battery charging circuit illustrated in Figs. 4A and 4B, which would be used in an exmplary integrated circuit embodiment are It is to be appreciated that the individual values for the resistances R₁ R₄ can vary considerably, as a practical matter by about 20 percent, the exact values for resistances R₁ R₄ not being nearly as important as the ratios among them. The ratios of R₁ R₄, R₂ R₄ and R₃ R₄, in a practical case, should desirably be within the range of substantially 5 percent and preferably substantially 1 percent. These criteria make it possible to realize the charging circuit of Figs. 4A and 4B as an integrated circuit using diffusion techniques. It is conceived that the integrated circuit, in an exemplary practical realization can be contained within a small housing preferably of cylindrical shape and having a length of about 3 16 inch and a diameter of about 5 36 inch. Two concentric wire leads each of about one inch can be provided to extend from the housing. Accordingly, expressing the above mentioned ratios as constants K₁, K₂ and K₃, respectively, we have and or, as the preferred case is, In some instances, a small capacitor 54 may be placed between the collector of the transistor 38 and the emitter of the transistor 42 and or a series circuit which includes a small capacitor 55 and a resistor 56 may be placed between the base of the transistor 38 and the emitter of the transistor 42 for the purpose of reducing the possibility that the circuit would oscillate, the capacitors 54, 55 and the resistor 56, being shown with their connections as dashed lined to indicate that they need not be present. The sixth resistance R₅ need not be in a particular ratio with respect to the other resistances and can readily be formed by metallization and be constitued by a metal contact to or between circuit points. The resistance R₅ is desirably a positive temperature coefficient PTC resistance, which increases in value as temperature increases, thus limiting current flow. The size of resistance R₅, relative to the sizes of resistances R₁ R₄, is very small. The resistance R₅ acts to stabilize the battery charging circuit which, in a practical case, operates at a temperature of about 125 C during battery charging when the chip is provided with a suitable thermal mounting. Charging current will decrease with an increase in ambient temperature of approximately forty five hundredths of one percent 0.45 per degree Centrigrade, roughly matching the desired change in nickle cadmium cell charging current with temperature. As illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B, like reference numerals designating like circuit components as those in Figs. 4A and 5B, the illustrative, fourth embodiment and a variant thereof of a charging circuit constructed in accordance with the present invention is generally designated by the numeral 57 and includes a pair of terminals 20, 21 which are shown, for purposes of illustration, connected across a conventional, 117 volt, 60 Hz voltage source 22. Also shown in Figs. 5A and 5B is an electric motor 23 and a motor energizing battery 24. The motor 23 and the battery 24 may be identical to the motor and battery of Figs. 2, 3, 4A and 4B. The battery charging circuit designated generally by the numeral 57 is connectable to the battery 24 by a single pole, double throw, manually operated switch 29 having a movably contact 30 for selective engagement with a stationary contact 31 which, when brought into contact with the movable contact 30 as illustrated, places the battery 24 in a recharging position. When the movable contact 30 is moved to engage its associated stationary contact 32, the battery charging circuit 50 is taken out of circuit with the battery 24, which is then in its operate position, the battery 24 energizing the motor 23. The basic charging circuit 57, as illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B, can be used to charge both 2.6 volt and 5.2 volt nickle cadmium batteries from 177 volt, 60 Hz power supplies from 234 volt, 60 Hz power supplies. It is to be appreciated, however, that the charging circuit illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B can be utilized to charge rechargeable batteries of considerably different voltage levels and itself have different levels and or supply frequency, the above mentioned levels and frequency being set out by way of example only. The battery charging circuit 57 includes a fifth resistor 61 resistance R ₅ , a first resistor 58 resistance R ₁ , a second resistor 59 resistance R ₂ and a third resistor 60 resistance R ₃ , which is included to provide internal feedback, connected in series with a rectifying diode 36 Fig. 5A , the terminal 20 and the contact 31 of the switch 29. The rectifying diode may be connected, as illustrated by rectifying diode 36 Fig. 5B , between a stationary contact 31 of a switch 29 Fig. 5B and the resistor 61, the resistor 60 being connected to the terminal 20. A further resistor 63 is connected between the emitter of the transistor 38 and the fixed contact 31 of the switch 29, as shown in Fig. 5A or to anode of the rectifying diode 36 , as shown in Fig. 5B. As illustrated, the rectifying diode 36 Fig. 5A has its anode connected to the terminal 20 and its cathode connected to one end of the third resistor 60. A fourth resistor 62 resistance R ₄ is connected between the connection of the second resistor 59 and the third resistor 60 and the collector of the NPN transistor 38, which has its emitter connected to the stationary contact 31 of the manually operated switch 29, via the further resistor 63, and, via the fifth resistor 61, to one end of the first resistor 58, which has its other end connected to the base of the transistor 38, as well as to one end of the second resistor 59. The transistor 38 and the resistors 58 63 constitute the control stage of the battery charging circuit 57. The collector of the transistor 38 is connected, in turn, to the gate electrode Again, by way of example only, typical values for circuit parameters of the battery charging circuit illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B, which could be used in an integrated circuit embodiment are As in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3, the individual values for the resistances R ₁ R ₄ can vary considerably, as a practical matter by about 20 percent, the exact values for resistances R ₁ R ₄ not being as important as the ratios among them. The ratios of R ₁ R ₄, R ₂ R ₄ and R ₃ R₄, in a practical case should desirably be within the range of substantially 5 percent and preferably substnatially 1 percent. These criteria make it possible to realize the charging circuits of Figs. 5A and 5B as an integrated circuits using diffusion techniques, the same dimensional characteristics mentioned in conjunction with the embodiments illustrated in the other figures applying equally well to this embodiment. Accordingly, expressing the above mentioned ratios as constants K ₁, K ₂ and K ₃, respectively, we have and or, as the preferred case is, The resistance R ₅ need not be in a particular ratio with respect to the other resistances and can easily be formed by metallization and be constituted by a metal contact to or between circuit points. As in the case of the other embodiments, the resistance R ₅ is desirably, a positive temperature coefficient PTC resistance, which increases in value as the temperature increases, thus limiting the current flow and serving to stabilize the circuit which in a practical integrated circuit version may operate at a chip temperature of about 125 C during battery charging when the chip is provided with a suitable thermal mounting. The PTC resistor 61 R ₅ is preferably formed by metallization with materials which are selected so that the resistor will also function as a fuse, allowing the circuit to fail without damaging the battery undergoing charging and endangering the surroundings. Charging current will decrease with an increase in ambient temperature of approximately 1 4 percent per degree Fahrenheit, roughly matching the desired change in nickle cadmium cell charging current with temperature. The resistor 63 which is connected in series with the emitter of the transistor 38 need not be in any particular ratio relationship to the resistances R ₁ R₄, its purposes being to provide an appropriate bias. A 1200 ρf capacitor 65 may be connected in parallel with the resistor 58 for the purpose of assuring that the circuit does not oscillate under some operating conditions. The circuit arrangements shown in Figs. 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B are placed in operation and function substantially in the same fashion as the circuits illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 consequently, the operational sequence need not be repeated in connection with Figs. 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B. In the case of the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5A and the variant shown in Fig. 5B, the MOSFET 64 allows charging current to flow to the battery 24 is in form of current pulses 45, 46 Fig. 6C , this transistor 64 being, in effect, turned ON and OFF at substantially the same voltage levels discussed above in relation to the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the waveforms shown in Figs. 6A and 6B applying with equal relevance to the circuits of Figs 5A and 5B, albeit the transistor 64 is a voltage operating device, while the transistors 39 42 are considered to be current operating devices. It is to be appreciated that in each illustrated case, a field effect transistor may be substituted for the Darlington configured transistors.
