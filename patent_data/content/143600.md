# A circuit for detecting signal charges transferred in a charge transfer device.

## Abstract
The signal charge detector includes a charge voltage con verter, a pre charge transistor pre charging the charge voltage converter to a first voltage, a first amplifier receiving the voltage at the charge voltage converter, a clamp circuit having a capacitor coupled with the output of the first amplifier at one end thereof and a gate for supplying a clamp voltage to the other end of the capacitor in response to a clamping pulse and a second amplifier for amplifying the output from said clamp circuit, and a means for producing an output signal in accord ance with the output from the second amplifier.
