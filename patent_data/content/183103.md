# Flat permeable membrane and method for manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A flat permeable polyolefin membrane 10 to 500 µm in thickness, which has in one surface thereof a compact layer formed of intimately bound fine polyolefin particles and possessed of fine pores and in the interior and the other surface thereof a layer formed of an aggregate of fine discrete polyolefin particles of an average diameter in the range of 0.01 to 5 µm so adjoined as to form fine labyrinthically continuing through pores and which, there fore, establishes communication between the opposite sur faces of said membrane.
