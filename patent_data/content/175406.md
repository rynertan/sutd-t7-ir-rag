# Process for the destruction of waste by thermal processing.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the destruction of waste, like biologically difficult to degrade halogen , nitrogen , sulphur , and or oxygen containing compounds by thermal hyd rogenolysis. The waste materials are heated together with an excess hydrogen and or hydrogen donor during 1 to 10 sec. To a temperature between 700 1220 C, followed by quenching the gaseous effluent of the reaction and separating it in a hydro carbon and hydrogen containing phase and a hydrogen halogenide s nitrogen , sulphur , and or oxygen containing compounds containing phase. Preferably the hydrogenolysis is performed in two steps, first during 1 10 sec. at 700 900 C and second during 1 10 sec. at 850 1200 C.
