# Improvements to the systems for bidirectional digital transmission with echo cancellation.

## Abstract
The improvements to the system for bidirectional digital transmission with echo cancellation allow the measurement of the received data signal 4 and the automatic adaptation of the attenuator SA and of the line equalizer EQ . They are implemented by using circuits already present in a conventional system, as well as auxiliary circuits SL, LC .
