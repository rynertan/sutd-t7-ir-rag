# Device for mixing two fluids.

## Abstract
A unique and novel mixing device to effect an intense and rapid mixing of two fluids which is comprised of a venturi tube 47 connected to the first fluid and a feed member 48 disposed around the venturi tube 47 through which the second fluid can flow. The feed member 48 has one or more channels 49 which connect with the venturi tube through which the second fluid can be admixed with the first fluid. A baffle 54 is positioned axially op posite the exit of the venturi tube 47 to promote additional mixing.
