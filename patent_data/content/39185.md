# An expanded snackfood and a process for preparing said expanded snackfood.

## Abstract
The invention provides cereal snackfoods of the expanded variety such as crisps and the like. The snackfoods of the invention comprise discrete cooked portions of a dough composition comprising gelatinised starch and added cereal bran other than rice bran, and contain at least about 5 by weight and preferably no more than about 30 by weight of oil or fat. The snackfoods may be produced from a half pro duct comprising at least some gelatinised starch and added cereal bran by frying or by immersion in a bed of hot particu late material followed by spraying with fat or oil. Even when fried the snackfoods have a lower energy value than compar able known products and the bran content provides a useful source of fibre in any diet.
