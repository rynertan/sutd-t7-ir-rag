## Description
This invention relates to aqueous alkaline cleaners.More particularly, this invention is concerned with a novel aqueous chlorinated highly alkaline cleaner which is especially useful in the food and beverage industry. Background of the Invention Aqueous alkaline solutions have been used for many years to clean glass and metal equipment, utensils, pipe lines and containers in the food and beverage industry.A chelating agent is generally included in the solution to promote cleaning. While there are many chelating agents, few of them are stable in highly alkaline solutions. Gluconic acid and heptagluconic acid are two of the few which are stable in highly caustic solution. Sodium tripolyphosphate, a widely used chelating agent, in highly caustic solution reverts to orthophosphate, which is ineffective as a chelating agent and is insoluble in concentrated caustic liquids. Even though aqueous highly alkaline cleaners are useful for the described purposes, it is desirable that they also be chlorinated so that a sanitizing effect and enhanced cleaning can be obtained simultaneously. The chelating agents commonly used, however, are unstable in aqueous highly alkaline chlorinated cleaners, especially concentrated 10 25 sodium hydroxide. Thus, nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, gluconic acid, heptagluconic acid and various phosphonic acids are not stable in such solutions.Such chelating agents react vith the hypochlorite and rapidly dissipate the available chlorine to ineffectively low concentrations. The salts of citric acid, well known as chelating agents, are only temporarily stable in aqueous highly alkaline chlorinated cleaners and soon citrates drop out of the solution. From the above it is clear that a need exists for a chelate containing aqueous highly alkaline chlorinated cleaner of improved stability, both as to its chlorine content and its chelating agent. Summary of the Invention According to the subject invention, there is provided a novel concentrated aqueous highly alkaline chlorinated cleaner comprising water, a highly alkaline material, a chlorine ion supplying agent, a citrate compound and a polyelectrolyte formed by reacting methyl vinyl ether with maleic anhydride. Detailed Description of the Invention Concentrated cleaners provided hy the invention desirably contain the above recited ingredients within the following ranges Ingredient Percent By Weight Highly alkaline material 10 65 Chlorine ion supplying agent 0.5 5 Citrate ion supplying compound 0.5 5 Polyelectrolyte 0.3 5 Water Balance Although a few highly alkaline materials can be used in producing the cleaner, sodium hydroxide is preferably employed because of its availability, low cost and good cleaning action. Potassium hydroxide is, however, suitable but it is more costly. The preferred range of sodium or potassium hydroxide is 20 to 40 percent by weight. The chlorine Ion supplying agent in the cleaner can be supplied by chlorine gas or by means of an aqueous solution of a chlorine containing compound which releases chlorine ions as, for example, sodium hypochlorite. The citrate ion supplying compound most suitably used is citric acid or sodium or potassium citrate. While other citrates can be employed, thy are likely to be more expensive and to add to the cost unnecessarily. The polyelectrolyte employed in the cleaner is formed by copolymerizing methyl vinyl ether with maleic anhydride using known conditions. The resulting products are commercially available and are sometimes generically referred to as poly methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydr.de . They are anionic, solid at room temperature, and available in low, medium and high molecular weights. The low molecular weight products are preferably used in the concentrate cleaners provided by this invention. Some commercial products available for use in the invention are Gantrez AN 119, C antrez AN139 and Gantrez AN 169. inclusion of a polyelectrolyte of the described composition is necessary for stability of the citrate ion. Production of the concentrated cleaner is readily achieved by first adding the powdered polyelectrolyte to the water with suitable stirring or agitation. Mixing is continued until a uniform milky white dispersion is obtained.The alkaline material is then added in the form of a solution or as a granular solid with suitable stirring. If necessary, the mixture is cooled to keep its temperature at about 1000F. The citrate ion supplying compound is then added. The temperature of the mixture may rise during such addition. The mixture is then cooled to about 900F. The chlorine supplying agent is then added. When chlorine gas is used, the gas is added well below solution level with slow agitation.When aqueous sodium hypochlorite is used, it can be poured in with suitable stirring to effect dispersion. A particularly suitable concentrate produced as described can have the following composition and properttes Percent By Weight eia2O 11 12 Available chlorine 2.7 3 Specific gravity 1.245 1.265 Appearance pale yellow clear liquid The concentrated cleaners provided by this invention are dilutable with water to form use solutions. About 0.5 to 2 ounces of concentrated cleaner can be diluted with water to make 1 gallon of use solution which is widely useful for cleaning. Preferred are use solutions containing about 1 of sodium or potassium hydroxide and 50 te 200 pprn of available chlorine. Such use solutions are particularly suitable in cleaning milking parlors, dairy equipment and milk transport tankers.The use solutions can be used at temperatures fron about 1100F to 1500F for such purposes with good cleaning and sanitizing results and no or low foaming during recirculation cleaning. The lack of phosphates and silicates in the products makes them exceptionally acceptable as does their good storage stability, good chelating auction and low temperature cleaning effectiveness. When the concentrates provided hy the invention are stored at 700F the chlorine loss can be expected to be no more than about 5 to 10 after three months and no more than about 30 to 35 after six months. Nevertheless, the concentrates will rapidly lose chlorine if stored at about 1200F which is, of course, an unnecessarily high storage temperature that can be easily avoided. The following example is presented to further illustrate the invention.
