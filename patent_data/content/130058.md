# Catalytic conversion of ethers to esters and alcohols.

## Abstract
A process for the conversion of dialkyl ethers to homologous carboxylic acid esters and alcohols comprises reacting a dialkyl ether having from two to twenty carbon atoms with hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a heterogeneous sulphided catalyst comprising nickel, optionally in admixture with a co catalyst selected from the elements of Group VIB of the Periodic Table, such as molyb denum.
