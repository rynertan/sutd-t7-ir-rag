# Strain transducers.

## Abstract
A strain transducer of the kind in which a plug is inset into a workpiece surface required an accurate interference fit with a drilled hole. One method proposes an oversize hole 12 which first receives an annular insert 14 in whose aperture 15 the transducer plug is a precision fit. The outer cylindrical surface of the insert has axially parallel serrations 16 which bite into the sides of the hole. Another method also has an oversize hole 22 whose mouth is constricted by a cylindrical punch 25 around a precision mandrel 24 which is then replaced by the transducer plug 28 . Serrations 35 may alternatively be provided directly on the transducer plug 32 , which can then be driven into a drilled hole 36 of only approximate accuracy.
