# Video game apparatus.

## Abstract
A video game apparatus is provided with a display de vice for displaying game progress picture images and an operation member manipulated for the game progress. The operation timing for the operation member is judged by a judgement unit as to whether the timing is within a time dura tion permissible in the game progress, and the success or failure of the game is determined. For a certain time period after the judgement unit starts to operate and check whether the operation member is actuated within the preset time duration or not, a mark is being displayed superposing upon the game progress picture images. The mark is for indicating the time during which the operation member is to be op erated. By actuating the operation member while the mark is being displayed, the game success is gained. The mark may be an arrow representation by which the operation direction for the operation member is also displayed.
