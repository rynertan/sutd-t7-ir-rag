## Description
Spike Connector Technical Field This invention concerns a spike connector that may be used in the medical field, particularly in conveying fluid from a fluid source to a patient. The spike connector of the present invention is a type having a main body portion and a hollowed spike extending therefrom for insertion into the stopper of the fluid source.Background Art Known in the art are integrally molded spike connectors for coupling a drip chamber to the stopper of a fluid source. An example of one type of spike connector, commonly referred to as an airway connector, is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. Des. 229,518, issued December 4, 1973. Other spike connectors, primarily for use with collapsible plastic containers, do not utilize a filtered airway. The configuration of certain prior art spike connectors has made it difficult for an operator to have access to the stopper once the spike of the spike connector has been inserted into the stopper. For example, while certain stoppers carry an injection site, and block the injection site from the operator once the spike of the spike connector is inserted into the stopper. Certain prior art spike connectors are configured to become relatively flush with the stopper once the spike is inserted into the stopper. This flush engagement may be deleterious because a leaking liquid may collect on the surface which engages the stopper. One prior art type of spike connector, licensed by American Hospital Supply Corporation in Italy, has a flat surface which engages the stopper with the flat surface forming the periphery of an open volume. This enables the collection of solution on the flat surface and in the open volume, and thereby increases chances of contamination.Disclosure of the Invention It is an object of the present invention to provide a spike connector in which the main body portion has only an extremely small amount of contact with the stopper so as to avoid surface area which may carry contaminants. Another object of the present invention is to provide a spike connector that enables relatively good access to an injection site on the stopper, after the spike of the spike connector is inserted into the stopper. A further object of the invention is to provide a spike connector that has a main body portion with a very small amount of contact with the stopper, enables relatively good access to an injection site carried by the stopper, yet is relatively efficient in its use of plastic. Another object of the present invention is to provide a spike connector that has a spike which enters easily into the stopper but maintains frictional compression with the stopper once the spike is fully inserted thereinto. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds. In accordance with the present invention, a spike connector is provided having a main body portion and a hollowed spike extending therefrom for insertion into the stopper of a fluid source and for conveyance of the fluid from the source through the spike and main body portion.The main body portion includes a pair of wings which extend upwardly in the direction of the spike but outwardly therefrom. The wings extend away from each other. The undersides of the wings are arcuately constructed to enable an operator to grasp the main body portion at the undersides. The tops of the wings serve to space other than the wing tops away from the fluid source stopper when the spike is inserted into the stopper. In the illustrative embodiment, the spike connector is molded in an integral, one piece construction, with each wing forming an included angle of about 450 between the wing and the axis of the spike. The main axis of both wings and the spike are coplanar. In the illustrative embodiment, the spike has a relatively polished surface adjacent its tip as compared to the surface adjacent the main body portion, in order to enable easy insertion of the spike into the stopper but good frictional engagement of the spike with the stopper once the spike is fully inserted into the stopper. A more detailed explanation of the invention is provided in the following description and claims, and is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of a spike connector constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Figure 2 is a top plan view thereof. Figure 3 is a cross sectional elevation thereof, taken along the plane of the line 3 3 of Figure 2. Figure 4 is a cross sectional elevation thereof, taken along the plane of the line 4 4 of Figure 2. Figure 5 is a front elevational view of an airway connector forming a modified embodiment of the present invention. Figure 6 is a side elevational view thereof. Detailed Description of t he Illustrative rnbod1ments Referring to Figures 1 4, a spike connector 10 is shown therein having a main body portion 12 and a hollowed spike 14 extending from the main body portion. The hollowed spike 14 is adapted for insertion into the stopper of a fluid source, such as a parenteral liquid container in the form of a collapsible plastic container. Main body portion 12 and spike 14 define a bore 16 which extends from an opening 18 adjacent spike tip 20 to outlet opening 22 at the distal end 24 of drip tube 26, for conveying the fluid from the container through opening 18, via bore 16 and through outlet opening 22, typically to a drip chamber that is connected to the bottom 28 of main body portion 12. Spike connector 10 is preferably molded of polypropylene in an integral, one piece construction. When the molding is completed, a surface area 30 from tip 20 downward to between about 1.0 centimeter and 1.5 centimeter, is polished. This provides surface 30 with a relatively polished, smooth surface finish in contrast to the surface finish of the remainder of the spike, thereby allowing relatively easy entry of the spike into the stopper but providing good retention of the spike within the stopper once it is inserted, by reason of the frictional compression provided by the less polished lower portion. Main body portion 12 includes a pair of wings 32, 34 each of which extends upwardly in the direction of the spike 14 but outwardly therefrom, preferably forming an included angle of about 450 between the respective wing and the spike axis. In the illustrative embodiment, the main axes of both wings 32 and 34, and the axis of spike 14 are coplanar. Main body portion 12 has four sides 36, 38, 40 and 42. Sides 36 and 38 form the undersides of wings 32 and 34, respectively, and are arcuate to provide an economically and functionally shaped comfortable finger guard.to sides 36 and 38 and the top portions thereof are narrow and generally planar while the bottom portions of sides 40 and 42 curve outwardly away from the spike. The bottom 28 of main body portion 12 has a generally circular cross sectional configuration perpendicular to the spike, and a slot 46 is provided to receive the top portion of the drip chamber. Drip tube 26 has an outlet opening 22 that provides a drop rate of about 20 drops per minute. The lower portion 50 of spike 14 has a greater external diameter, so that the spike may be utilized with containers having a larger than normal stopper opening.In the illustrative embodiment, spike 14 is provided with three equally spaced openings 18 about the spike tip and in communication with bore 16. Top surfaces 54 and 56 of wings 32 and 34, respectively, are smooth and curved to avoid dust and fluid collection. Wing tips 58 and 60 are spaced a relatively great distance from lower surface 62 and tips 58 and 60 will be the only contact points of the main body portion against the stopper when the spike is inserted into the stopper. This substantial lack of surface contact between the main portion and the stopper is useful in preventing the collection of leaking liquid on the main body portion. In addition, by utilizing extending wings 32 and 34, bottom 28 of the main body portion 12 is at a relatively far distance away from the stopper, without having to utilize a substantial amount of plastic, and enabling the operator to have relatively good access to an injection site carried by the stopper.By utilizing top portions of sides 40 and 42 that are relatively flat surfaces, the operator may write on such flat surface with a marking pen, if so desired, while the curved lower surface of sides 40 and 42 enable easy removal of the spike connector from the stopper. It can be seen that wings 32 and 34 in cooperation with the lower portion of the main body portion operate to provide a finger grip that is efficiently designed for easy insertion and removal of the spike connector from the stopper. At the same time, wings 32 and 34 are operable to prevent touch contamination of the stopper.Further, the relatively narrow sides 40 and 42 plus the distance of the bottom of the main body portion from the top thereof aid in enabling the operator to have good access to an injection site carried by the stopper for supplementary medication additions or use of a separate airway. Still further, the wings have very small contact points with the stopper when a spike is inserted into the stopper, and thus contamination by reason of the liquid pooling along the top of the main body portion is alleviated. An airway connector, constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention, is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. Identical reference numerals are used in Figures 5 and 6 for structural components which are identical to those utilized in the Figures 1 4 embodiment. However, the airway connector of Figures 5 and 6 utilizes a spike 14 which carries a separate fluid bore and airway bore, with the airway bore communicating with a filtered airway opening 70. Although airway opening 70 is illustrated at a right angle with respect to spike 14, it is to be understood that the airway opening may extend at other than a right angle with respect to spike 14. The airway opening 17 surrounds a hydrophobic airway filter 72, preferably formed of Porex filter material. A cap or plug may be utilized to close and seal airway 70 when the airway is not used, for example, when the connector is issued with a collapsible plastic container. All of the benefits and the results concomitant with the spike connector described in connection with Figures 1 4 are also concomitant with respect to the airway spike connector described in connection with Figures 5 and 6. Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that various modifications and substitutions may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the novel spirit and scope of the present invention.
