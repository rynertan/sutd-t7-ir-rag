# Method and apparatus for modifying a run length limited code.

## Abstract
Code modification circuitry 26 alters the end portion of each block in a sequence of code blocks, and also inserts additional bits at the junction between contiguous blocks. The codes to be processed are run length limited RLL codes having a DC component which is to be removed for certain applications such as magnetic recording. The modification circuitry retrains the RLL format. Charge or the integral of the waveform accumulated by the sequence of bits of one block is compensated by selecting the sense of charge accumulation in next block to be of opposite sense. This is accomplished by the code modification circuitry using a relatively small set of possible combinations of digital words at the junctions of the blocks.
