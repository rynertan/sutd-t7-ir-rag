# Method of manufacturing a semi conductor device comprising dielectric isolation regions.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of forming a mask material pattern 104a, 104b at least on a portion of a semiconductor layer 103 which corresponds to a prospective element formation region etching the semiconductor layer 103 , using the mask material pattern 104a, 104b , to form a first groove which is wide and shallow burying a first isolating material 105 in the first groove to a thickness substantially equal to the depth of the first groove etching a portion of the first isolating material film 105 which is located in the vicinity of the prospective element formation region to partially expose a bottom of the first groove, thereby forming a second groove which is narrower than said first groove, a position of the second groove being defined by the mask material pattern 104b forming a third groove which is deeper than said first and second grooves by etching a bottom of the second groove and burying a second isolating material 108 in the third groove.
