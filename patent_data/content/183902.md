# Method of attaching segments to cutting tool.

## Abstract
A method of attaching segments to the body of a cutting tool, such as a diamond saw blade, is initiated by inseparably coupling the segments to their respective interposed mem bers by sintering. The interposed members are made of iron, cobalt, or other metal. Then, the interposed members are rigidly coupled to the body by welding or other method.
