# Secondary arc extinction device.

## Abstract
In a three phase transmission line, a variable reactance is provided in parallel with the interphase capacitance so that, in the event of a phase to earth secondary arc occurring, the reactance and capacitance are caused to resonate thereby providing only a high impedance path between the phases and thus reducing interphase current flow to a low value at which the secondary arc can be extinguished.
