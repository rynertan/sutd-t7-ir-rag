# Authenticating the identity of a user of an information system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for authenticating the identity of a user of an information system. A data communication system operating in accordance with an embodiment of the invention includes one or more terminals operatively coupled to a host data processing system each having cryptographic apparatus for cryptographic data communications. In order to authenticate the identity of terminal users of the system, a host system initialization process is first performed to provide a table of test patterns for use during subsequent authentication processing. This is accomplished by providing terminal user identification numbers and passwords and a predetermined number at the host data processing system. A first initialization operation is performed at the host data processing system in accordance with the terminal user identification numbers and passwords to obtain terminal user authentication patterns. A second initialization operation is performed at the host data processing system in accordance with the predetermined number and the terminal user identification numbers to obtain terminal user first verification patterns. A third initialization operation is performed at the host data processing system in accordance with the terminal user authentication patterns and the terminal user first verification patterns to obtain the table of terminal user test
