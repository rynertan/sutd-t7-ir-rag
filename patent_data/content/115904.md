# Transaction terminal with simplified data entry.

## Abstract
In a transaction terminal, a credit card reader 2 is used not only to enter data from cards of customers, but a special card 20 is used to place the terminal in supervisory modes in at least one of which it will accept data from further special cards 24, 26, 28 which are used to input data used in the transac tion mode, particularly alphanumeric data for printing on trans action slips. The terminal has a customer accessible auxiliary keyboard 30, 32 which may be used for data entry, at a loca tion remote from the main unit, allowing for point of sale data entry, including private entry of a customer s Personal Identifi cation Number, either to validate a transaction or during selec tion of a PIN for encryption by the terminal.
