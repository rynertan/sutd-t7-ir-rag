# GAP CONTROL SYSTEM FOR LOCALIZED VACUUM PROCESSING

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the gap 42 between localized vacuum processing envelope apparatus and a workpiece 16 as the workpiece, typically a semiconductor wafer, is moved laterally with respect to the envelope apparatus. The en velope apparatus includes an envelope 12 which defines an internal vacuum processing zone and a generally planar tip 42 spaced from the workpiece during processing by the gap. The gap control apparatus includes a gap sensor 70 for measuring the gap, a control circuit 60 for comparing the measured gap with a required gap and generating an error signal, and an actuating means 26 30 for varying the gap in response to the error signal. The gap can be sensed by sensing the pressure level in the vacuum processing appar atus. The actuating means can include a plurality of piezoelectric actuators which can vary both the gap and the angle of the workpiece with respect to the tip of the vacuum processing apparatus. The disclosed apparatus is particular ly useful in connection with particle beam systems such as electron beam lithography systems. In another embodiment, the gap is controlled by an air gearing between the envelope apparatus and the workpiece.
