# Rebar splicing and anchoring.

## Abstract
Rebars to be embedded in a monolithic concrete struc ture are spliced together also deformed rebars are spliced together across an expansion joint or construction joint between two or more monolithic concrete pours in that one rebar is provided with a threaded receiver barrel, possibly having a flange, and into which is introduced the, preferably, expanded and threaded and of the other rebar no third splicing element is involved. Short rebars with a receiver at one end can also serve for defining anchor points in the outer surface of a concrete structure.
