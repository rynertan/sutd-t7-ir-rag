# A method for controlling magnification variation.

## Abstract
In a method for controlling magnification variation in which an original picture image is projected on a light receiving surface with a desired magnification, the project ed picture image is moved in the sub scanning direction which intersects the main scanning direction where the sensor is aligned, and the feeding speed V in the sub scan ning direction and the electric charge storage time are controlled.
