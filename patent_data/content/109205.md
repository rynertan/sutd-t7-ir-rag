# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for approximating x ray detector data from a malfunctioning computed tomography detector. A view of data is gathered for each of a plurality of detectors in a stationary detector scanner. Data from malfunctioning detectors is approximated by averaging the data from closely adjacent detectors after a preferred gradient is chosen to establish which detector data is to be averaged.
