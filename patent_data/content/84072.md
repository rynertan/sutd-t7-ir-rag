## Description
This invention relates to a method and apparatus used for the production of foundry molds from a granular material. More particularly the invention is directed to the production of foundry shell molds in a substantially automated fashion wherein the process of charging the mold box assembly and associated pattern sections, hardening the granular charge into a predetermined configuration and dimension, removal of the formed foundry product and unused granular portion and entire recycling of the set forth operation is accomplished. The original process for producing shell cores and molds was developed by Dr. Johannes Croning in Germany during World War II. Dr. Croning s process was directed to the use of thermal setting resins and producing a fluidized hardenable synthetic resin mixture. To date the Croning process is used but has serious drawbacks due to the fact that the resin utilized results in a hardening of the binder under the action of heat in the range of 4000F to 4800F 204.40 248.90C . To create such heat large amounts of natural gas or electricity are used in foundries employing the Croning process. In addition the priorCroning process necessitates the construction of core boxes of high heat resistance. Such core box structures are obviously subject to relatively short life cycles. Other disadvantages associated with the Croning process include undesirable working conditions as well as significantly long curing times. These long curing times result in low productivity. One example of such curing times are three minutes for a ten pound product. In order to overcome the obvious disadvantages associated with the Croning process other foundry processes have been developed for producing cores and or molds. One of such processes is known as the cold box process first generally demonstrated around 1968. This cold box process involved the coating of a sand with a binder and then curing the binder coated sand by passing a catalyst gas through the sand mixture once the sand is disposed into its predetermined configuration due to formation with a pattern structure. One major disadvantage associated with the cold box process involves the relatively greater weight of the produced core or mold caused by the entire volume defined within the pattern of the mold box being filled with sand and hardened by exposure to the catalyst gas. Such weight was generally in the range of three or four times heavier than comparably sized shell molds. This obviously resulted in waste of material, increased production costs and product handling problems. However, recently a method and apparatus for manufacturing shell cores utilizing some cold box principles was developed as disciosed in my U.S.Patent No. 4,232,726 of November 11, 1980. This patent generally discloses a process that is directed to providing a core box having a pattern formed of microporous material and investing bindercoatea granular material into a volume defined by the pattern. The core box and the pattern are then sealed so that the volume encloses a gas at rest, for instance, air at atmospheric pressure. Next, a catalyst gas is applied at a pressure greater than atmospheric through the pattern so that the catalyst gas exerts a uniform pressure from the entire interior surface of the pattern against the enclosed air volume. The catalyst gas, due to its being introduced at a higher pressure, will penetrate a distance through the granular material determined by equilibrium being achieved between the applied catalyst gas pressure and a resisting pressure developed by the enclosed air.During penetration of the catalyst gas through the granular material, hardening or curing is effectuated and a hollow core is produced with a thickness determined by the extent of catalyst gas penetration. This patent also discloses a core box assembly for use in the process as described above which includes a pair of core box sections each having a pattern section mounted thereon and spaced therefrom. This construction results in a core box having an air space which surrounds the pattern and provides an opening extending into the volume defined by the pattern. The opening made of nonporous material is necessary for investing granular material into the pattern prior to application of the catalyst gas and also serves as a discharge port after curing when the core box is rotated approximately 1800. While my aforesaid patent establishes the basic theory and operation for the improved heatless mass production of shell mold at high production rates, further experience has shown that the disclosed method and apparatus can be improved. For example, it would be desirable to provide a better method of disposing of the unused sand after completion of the molding operation. In my aforesaid patent this required the complete inversIon of the mold box assembly after curing which is not always desirable. It is the aim of this invention to provide an improved method and apparatus over that in my aforesaid patent in which among other changes, the need for complete inversion of the mold box assembly is avoided and wherein other improvements in the method and apparatus of my aforesaid patent are effected. More specifically, the present invention provides a method of forming foundry shell molds from a binder coated granular material, said method being characterized by the steps of disposing individual gas permeable cope and drag pattern sections together in a mold box assembly comprising separate, nonpermeable mold box sections forcing the binder coated granular material into a common cavty defined between the pattern sections when the pattern sections and associated mold box sections are in a closed position, positioning a layer of granular material contiguous a working surface of each pattern section, whereby the respective working surfaces substantially define the boundries of the common cavity, exhausting each mold box section to atmosphere simultaneously to initial introduction of catalyst gas thereto and ending said exhausting after a brief predetermined time period from said initial introduction of catalyst gas, thereby flushing air from each mold box section and allowing maintenance of substantially undiluted catalyst gas in exposure with the binder coated granular material for a predetermined period of time, forcing the catalyst gas into each mold box section for permeation through each pattern section under pressure, sealing the interior of the mold box section during exposure of catalyst gas to the granular material, finally exhausting the catalyst gas from each mold box section after a predetermined period of exposute of catalyst gas to the granular material, separating the pattern sections from one another by outward movement thereof in a single, common plane of each pattern section from a vertically oriented separating plane defined between the pattern sections when in a closed position, discharging the unhardened portion of the granular material from the separating pattern sections during the separating movement, and ejecting the mold halves from the pattern sections at the end of their outward movement. Further, the invention also relates to an apparatus for use in producing foundry shell molds made from a binder coated granular material, said apparatus including a frame, a mold box assembly mounted on said frame means and disposable between an open and closed position, said mold box assembly comprising at least two box sections pivotally attached to said frame and movable in d single plane into and out of sealing engagement with each other, the gaspermeable pattern means having a predetermined configuration mounted within said mold box assembly and including at least one pattern section mounted within each of said box sections, said pattern sections being disposed in spaced apart relation from said other box section to form a cavity on an interior portion of said pattern means, and being disposed in spaced apart relation from a base portion of said pivotally attached box sections, the boundary of said cavity being at least partially defined by a working surface of said pivotally attached box section when said mold box assembly is in its closed position investment means including an outlet having its axis disposed in said single plane of movement and further disposed in direct communication relative to said cavity whereby granular material is disposable within said cavity through said investment means so as to be disposable in direct contiguous relation with said in terior portion of said pattern section. Further features and advantages of the invention will be evident from the following description of preferred embodiments cf the invention taken together with the accompanying drawings wherein FIG. 1 is a front view of the supporting frame and mold box assembly of the present invention in its closed position wherein broken lines indicate mold box sections in their open separated position. FIG. 2 is a side view in partial cutaway of the embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a side view of the mold box assembly of the embodiment of FIG. 4 showing linkage system and ejection mechanism. FIG. 4 is a sectional view of the mold box assembly immediately prior to charging with the binder coated sand or granular material with details of the ejection assembly of the present invention. FIG. 5 is the interior of the mold box assembly in partial section showing the box and pattern sections with the charged granular mass in the interior portion between the pattern sections. FIG. 6 is the structural embodiment of FIGS.4 and 5 with the catalyst gas being exposed to the charged mass of granular material causing formation of the shell mold or core as shown. FIG. 7 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the pattern portion of the present invention. FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a porous metal insert use in the pattern embodiment of FIG.7. As best shown in Fig. 1 the subject invention relates to a method and apparatus for the production of foundry shell molds comprising a frame 10 disposed in supporting relation to a mold box assembly generally indicated as 12. The mold box assembly 12 comprises two mold box sections 14 and 16 attached to support plates 13 and 15 which are pivotally mounted as at 18 to the supporting frame 10 so as to rotatably or pivotally move about the pivot axis 19 disposed in the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 in a substantially horizontal plane. With reference to Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6 it is seen that the box sections 14 and 16 are disposed in their closed position in a substantially vertical orientation and separated by an imaginary vertical plane 20 defined by the engagement of the correspondingly disposed periphert of each box section 14 and 16. The sealing engagement between the box sections 14 and 16 as accomplished, will be described in greater detail hereinafter. Pattern means for drag and cope parts of the mold comprising pattern sections 22 and 24 are mounted within each box section 14 and 16 respectively so as to be disposed in spaced relation from a base portion 25 and 26 Fig. 5 and 6 respectively of the box sections 14 and 16. The pattern sections 22 and 24 define drag and cope parts of the mold and have a predetermined configuration intended to correspond to the resulting configuration of the drag or cope.Pattern sections are so disposed in facing engagement to one another, the separating plane 20 and an interior portion 30 defined between the pattern sections 22 and 24 when the mold box sections 14 and 16 are in their closed position as shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. With regard to the interior portion 30, a charge of binder coated sand or granular material is forced therein from investment means 32, for instance a conventional sand blower which also serves as a supply facility for maintenance of predetermined amounts of the sand or granular material therein. More specifically the Investment means 32 Is disposed in direct communication with the investment hole or aperture 34 formed on the top of mold box 12 for the passage of the sand or granular mass 33 therethrough.A seal means generally indicated Fig. 6 as 36 is positionable in sealing engagement with the investment aperture 34 so as to seal the interior of the box assembly 12 from atmosphere. This sealing prevents the catalyst gas from passing through the entire mass of sand 33 upon introduction of the catalyst gas into the mold box assembly. The sealing member of facility 36 may be mounted on the exterior of the investment means 32 and comprise a pivotally mounted sealing arm 38 hingedly attached at 39 so as to pivot upon actuation of fluid cylinder assembly 40 into covering relation relative to the investment aperture 34. More specifically a sealing pad 41 made from a flexible or like sealable material may be secured to the bottom portion of the sealing arm 38 so as to fit over the sealing aperture 34 as schematically represented in Fig. 6. Accordingly, pressure, of a predetermined degree is capable of being maintained on the interior of the mold box assembly 12. Gas is thereby prevented from passing through sand 33 and aperture 34 into atmosphere. As stated above in connection with my priorU.S. Patent 4,232,726, formation of the mold product is due to exposure of the binder coated sand or granular material 33 within the interior portion 30 with a predetermined catalyst gas. With reference to Figs.5 and 6 a catalyst gas is introduced from a supply not shown generally represented by directional arrow 37. The catalyst gas passes into a valving facility 39 through conduit or entrance 40 for direct fluid communication with and passage into the interior of each box section 14 and 16. With reference to Fig. 6, the valve assembly 39 is disposed to establish fluid communication between the supply 37 and the entrance aperture 41 through inlet 42. The investment of the catalyst gas occurs at a pressure greater than atmosphere while the mold box sections 14 and 16 are disposed in their closed and sealed relation to one another thereby effectively segregating the interior of the mold box assembly from atmosphere. It should be noted that each box section 14 and 16 is provided with a vent or exhaust means 47 disposed in spaced apart relation from inlet 42. This exhaust means 47 is maintained open some brief period of time immediately subsequent to introduction of the catalyst gas through inlets 42.This exhaust means 47 is maintained open some brief period of time immediately subsequent to introduction of the catalyst gas through inlets 42. This exhaust means 47 is left open only until the air within the box sections are flooded from the interiors thereof. The box sections 14 and 16 are then sealed as the exhaust means 47 is closed. Upon the introduction of the catalyst gas at a pressure greater than atmosphere through the pattern sections 22 and 24, a pressure is exerted against the enclosed air volume. The catalyst gas, due to its being introduced at a higher pressure will penetrate a distance through the sand or granular material 33 wherein such distance of penetration is determined by eguilibrium being achieved between the applied catalyst gas pressure and a resisting pressure developed by enclosed air. As best shown in Fig. 6 and indicated by toe plurality of pressure arrows 44 representing the penetrating catalyst gas, hardening or curing is effective and a shell mold 45 is produced with a thickness determined by the extent of the catalyst gas penetration. After formation of the mold product 45 has been established, the valve facilities 39 are closed.Exhausts 47 through valuing not shown are opened and sealing arm.38 is removed as to establish communi cation between the interior of the mold box assembly 12 and each mold box section 14 and 16 with atmosphere or a gas removal or waste facility. After formation of the core or mold product 45 and after evacuation of the catalyst gas as described, positioning means Figs. 1 and 2 generally as 48 serve to separate the box sections 14 and 16 away from the separating plane 20 and in a first and second open position as will be described in detail hereinafter. The opening or separating of the box section 14 and 16 causes the flow o the unused granular or sand material from the opposite portion of the mold box assembly generally indicated as 49 through the action of gravity. When in its open position, the mold box assembly open position represented in broken lines of Fig. 1 allows the unused granular material to fall into a collection hopper 50 defining a portion of the transfer means Fig.2 51. Such transfer means includes, in addition to the prepositioned hopper 50, a conveyor in the form of a mechanical delivery conveyor housed with conduit or casing 52 and extending between the collection hopper 50 and a point of delivery generally indicated as 53 into the interior of the supply or investment means 32. Accordingly, waste of material not used in the actual solidification or formation of the mold or core product 45 is eliminated through the recollection, transfer and reuse of the unused granular or sand particles through the provision of the mechanical conveyor housed within casing or conduit 52 and defining a major portion of the transfer means 51. Generally mechanical conveying is preferred since the type of binder used does not tolerate the airation of a pneumatic conveyor system. The positioning means, again to be described in greater detail hereinafter, is disposed to separate the box sections 14 and 16 from one another and outwardly from the vertically oriented separating plane 20. The open position is clearly defined by the broken line representation of box sections 14 and 16 in Fig. 1. The open position may be defined as a separated orientation or position of the box sections 14 and 16 from one another between their truly closed or sealed position as shown in solid lines in Fig. 1. More specifically the open position may be completed at generally a 850 900 separation or angular inclination from the separating plane 20.When the box sections are moving to their open position this angular inclination is such as to allow complete removal of the unused sand material into the hopper 50. The positioning means 48 comprises oppositely disposed piston and cylinder assemblies 52 and 53 having their distal end pivotally attached to the supporting frame 10 as at 54 and 55 respectively. Both of the piston and cylinder assemblies 52 and 54 are fluid activated wherein at least one of the assemblies such as 53 has predetermined greater fluid pressure than the oppositely disposed and cooperating assembly 52. In turn the other of the assemblies 52 has a longer stroke because of the dimensional differences between the piston and cylinder assembly 52 with that of the piston.and cylinder 53. These dimensional differences cooperate to effect a firm sealing engagement between the mold sections 14 and 16 specifically along the vertically oriented plane 20 as will be explained.Due to the fact that the assembly 53 has a greater fluid capacity, it is activated to extend outwardly to its greatest distance stroke which will position the associated mounted b z. shell 16 in the predetermined desired orientation relative to the intended closed position along the separating plane 20.Simultaneously, the assembly 52 is activated and serves to rotate the associated box section 14 downwardly into firm engagement with the position of box section 16. Due to the greater force being exerted on box section 16, the forced engagement of box 14 with box 16 will not cause a displacement or movement of box 16 from its predetermined position. The downward stroke of assembly 52 will continue until firm engagement of box 14 with box 16. Since box 16 will not move from its vertically oriented predetermined position, box 14 will accordingly be disposed in the desired sealed and closed mating position relative to box 16 and the vertical separating plane 20 since the downward stroke of the assembly 52 will occur until such mating engagement is ac compl ished. With regard to ejection means primary reference is made to Fig. 4 as well as Figs. 1 and 2. The ejection means comprises an ejection plate 60 mounted on the interior of each box section 14 and 16 and having ejection pins 61 extending outwardly therefrom into penetrating relative to the respective patterns 22 and 24 so as to pass therethrough Fig. 4 . Activation of the ejection means occurs through the movement of two pairs of rods 63 serving to pivot lever arms 64 against bIasIng springs 65 in a manner that will be readily apparent through review of Fig. 4.The downward forcement of rods 63 occurs upon each of the sections 14 and 16 moving upwardly to their open position as shown in Fig. 1. By virtue of being disposed in such positIon the roller elements 67 come into interruptive engagement with support arms 70 which may be in the form of adjustable fingers 69.The specific disposition of the fingers 69 may again be adjusted relative to support arms 70 of the frame 10 so as to precisely control the ejection mechanism through interruptive engagement of the member 69 with the rollers 67. For purposes of clarity, Fig.4 shows only a single ejection facility including rod 63 and roller 67 cooperating with the ejection facility mounted within box section 16. However, it should be noted that such an ejection facility cooperates with each of the box sections 14 and or 16 to effectively remove the products 45 formed Fig. 6 . Removal of the product once formed occurs through automatic actuation of a product removal means generally indicated as 78 in the form of conveyors or like apparatus or support tables pivotable about axis point 79 into receiving position indicated in broken lines as 80. Such broken line positioning is representative of the position which the conveyor or receiving facility 78 are positioned to receive the products, once ejected. When the ejection means is properly activated, the products 45 will fall or be forced from the working surface of each pattern section 22 and 24 and be delivered on the product removal means 78. Transfer, through proper activation of conveyor facilities to a supply or transfer table 82 is readily accomplished so as to dispose the various formed mold products 45 out of the path of travel of the remaining structural components of the assembly when it passes into its next operative cycle. For purposes of clarity, it should be noted that the preferred embodiment shows the arrangement of the mold box in a substantially vertical orientation wherein the box sections 14 and 16 are moved outwardly in separating relation from the vertically oriented separating plane 20. ifl such orIentation the pIvotal axis 19 is arranged In a substantially horizontal plane. However, it is within the concept of the present invention to reorient the entire mold box assembly so as to have it operate in a horizontally oriented plane such that the pivotal axis 19 about which the box sections 14 and 16 rotate is disposed in a substantIally vertical plane while the separating plane is also maintained in a vertical plane. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises the provision that the frame means includes plates 13 and 15 having attached thereto conventional shell mold sections of the type used in the aforementioned Croning process. These mold box sections will utilize heat for curing the binder coated sand and the provision of heating facilities will be included in the same way as it is used currently with the Croning process. Such heating facilities and conventional type mold box sections are well known and accordingly not shown or discussed in detail herein. As noted above, the pattern sections secured within the mold box assembly are permeable and are specifically disposed, configured and structured so that one of such pattern sections defines the cope of the produced mold while the other of such pattern sections defines the drag of such mold. The placement of the cope and drag portions of the pattern sections, as set forth above, are positionable to form a common cavity on the interior thereof such that cope and drag portions of the resuiting shell mold will be formed concurrently from the same mold box assembly rather than separately as is now done in the currently known or conventional process. Another feature of the present invention is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and comprises the placement of the ventilation or exhaust portion or outlet 47 in spaced apart relation from the inlet aperture 42. This structure is important in part so as to allow flushing or instantaneous removal of the normal, atmospheric air within the space between the base 25 and the pattern section of each mold box assembly upon entering of the catalyst gas therein. More specifically the vent or exhaust means 47 are left open for a certain brief, predetermined length of time upon and immediately concurrent to the entrance of the catalyst gas into the chamber through inlet 42. Such vents are allowed to remain open, such predetermined brief period of time, until all of the normally atmospheric air or gas is flushed out of this section as the catalyst gas enters therein. Due to the separated locations of the vent or exhaust means 47 and the inlet means 42, the slushing of the air thru the inlet allows the catalyst gas to be undiluted as it reaches the binder coated sand within the common cavity between the cope and drag pattern sections of the mold. In another modification, a continuous flow of gas is provided between the inlet and the exhaust 47 such that the flow of catalyst gas is thereby directed along the pattern section. This continuous flow allows molecular diffusion between the gas and the air inside of the sand mass and allowing action of the binder causing hardening of the layer of binder coated sand immediately contiguous the working surface of each pattern section. In addition a further step of the subject process includes maintaining the sand mixture in exposed relation to the catalyst gas for a predetermined extended period of time sufficient to insure curing of the binder layer contiguous to the working surface of the pattern.This extended exposure significantly adds to the tensile strength of the ultimately formed shell mold product.This additional strength is necessary so that the formed product can withstand the forces of ejection and handling after the molds leave the pattern. In general, such extended period of time is sufficient in the range between 25 and 30 seconds. Since the general thickness of the resulting shell mold is significantly less than normal resulting products using conventional processes and apparatus the above set forth additional tensile strength is required for the ejection and handling steps to follow formation of the formed product. Finally with regard to Figs. 7 and 8, a further embodiment of the present invention comprises the formation of the pattern represented herein as at least one of the pattern sections 22 from the plurality of porous metal ele .t r.ts 92 disposed within similarly configured apertures 90 formed in the pattern section 22 . The individual porous metal elements 92 may be formed from a bronze sintered powder metal material having a pore size of between 5 to 25 microns. In addition, each of the inserts or elements are disposed in spaced apart relation to one another a predetermined distance at least equal to twice the diameter of the elements themselves. Such spaced apart array or pattern is defined by the inserts and apertures 90 in which they are placed being disposed in an alternate substantially offset relation to one another as shown in Fig. 7. This allows substantially even and consistent exposure of the catalyst gas as it passes through the porous metal inserts to the binder coated sand disposed contiguous to the working surface of the pattern section.
