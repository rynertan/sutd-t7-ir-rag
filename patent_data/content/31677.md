# Class AB push pull FET amplifiers.

## Abstract
The output stage of a quasi linear amplifier employs a p channel and an n channel FET Ω1 with Ω2 with their sources connected to relatively positive B and relatively ne gative B operating voltage rails to drive a load LM from their drain to drain connection, so that despite their being en hancement types full rail to rail output voltage capability B , B can be obtained without need for bootstrapping. Input signal voltage and direct coupled feedback voltage are applied to the gate to gate connection of p channel and n channel sourcefollowers Ω3 Ω4 with their respective sources di rectcoupled to the gate of the p channel FET Ω1 in the out put stage and to the gate of the n channel FET Ω2 in the out put stage, respectively, and with their respective drains con nected to the relatively negative operating voltage rail B and to the relatively positive operating voltage rail B re spectively, in a representative driver stage Ω3, Ω4 .
