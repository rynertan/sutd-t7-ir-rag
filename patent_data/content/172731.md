# Classifier and controller for vertical mill.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a vertical mill, a classifier for the mill, and a controller for the classifier. The vertical mill includes a casing having a top plate, and the classifier is adjacent the top plate. Beneath the top plate, upon which impinges an upwardly moving gas and powdery material being supplied from the lower portion of the casing, are provided a plurality of rotary blades or rotary rods which have a vertical axis of rotation. A gap is provided between the rotary blades and the top plate, and an annular impinge ment member is suspended from the top of the casing to outwardly surround the plurality of rotary blades in such a way as to shield the gap. Further, an opening is provided adjacent the impingement member through which a portion of the gas and powdery material pass. The controller of the classifier includes means for adjusting the opening through which the powdery material passes. A collecting means is provided for collecting pow dery material from the classifier, including a detecting means for detecting the distribution of the particle sizes of the powdery material receified by the collecting means and giving an output related to the distribution. Means for adjusting the flow area of the opening in response to the output is also provided.
