## Description
Process for displacing dissolved gas from water THIS INVENTION is a process for displacing dissolved gas from water. For many industrial purposes, water is required to be as free as possible of dissolved gases, especially oxygen. For others, while dissolved oxygen cannot be tolerated, another dissolved gas, such as methane, nitrogen or carbon dioxide, is acceptable. For example, where water is required to be used as feed to a boiler, all dissolved gases are normally removed. Oxygen and carbon dioxide present in boiler feed water would give rise to corrosion and inert gases such as nitrogen are usually conveniently removed at the same time as the other dissolved gases. To give another example, where water is used for injection into oil bearing formations to enhance production of oil from wells, it is necessary that oxygen be absent from the water, as otherwise bacterial growth in the rock pores is encouraged and the pores may become blocked and oil displacement inhibited. However other gases, for example gaseous hydrocarbons, can be readily tolerated in the water. For all these purposes, oxygen and or other dissolved gases have to be removed. To achieve this removal, a range of designs of so called deaerators or degassifiers n have been developed. These devices are static devices in which either the water is exposed to reduced pressure or a displacing gas is passed through the water at atmospheric, reduced or elevated pressure. The large volumes of water which are treated in these ways entail large vessels and ancillary equipment and represent considerable investment of capital. There is therefore a great incentive to devise ways of reducing the size of the vessels involved.In addition, where the water treatment is to be carried out off shore, for example in operating boiler feed water for ships or in deaerating injection water for off shore wells, any way of reducing the volume and or weight of the treatment unit is a highly desirable end. We have now devised a process for displacing dissolved gas from water, which entails more compact equipment than has hitherto been use . Our process comprises carrying out the displacing of the gas, by exposing the water to reduced pressure and or by contacting it with a second gas, in a high surface area rotor rotating at such a speed as to subject the water to an acceleration, expressed in a direction radial with respect to the axis of rotation, which is greater than the acceleration due to gravity. The second gas, if used, may if desired be a vapour. The manner in which the process of the present invention is operated depends upon the specific requirement of each situation. Nore specifically, it depends upon the nature of the water available, the characteristics required of the water produced and the availability of a second gas to displace the dissolved gas. For example, if the product water is to be used to feed a boiler, especially a boiler operating at high pressure, then it is necessary to remove all gases down to very low concentrations. Thus, a typical water feed to a high pressure boiler might be required to have an oxygen concentration as low as 0.007 parts per million ppm . To achieve oxygen levels as low as this, while simultaneously displacing dissolved nitrogen and any dissolved carbon dioxide, a highly suitable displacing gas is steam. Since one effect of displacing dissolved gas from water with steam is to raise the temperature of the water, the use of steam as the deaerating vapour is of particular value for boiler feedstocks, as the water would in any case require to be heated for this latter purpose. As indicated, another way of implementing the process of the present invention is to expose the water in the rotor to reduced pressure. This method is of value where it is necessary to lower gas contents to very low levels in water which is not subsequently to be heated. However, operation at ambient pressure with a displacing gas is to be preferred where facilities and economics allow. In preparing water for injection into oil wells, the displacing of other gases than oxygen is not important. Thus it is possible and very convenient to employ as the displacing gas any gaseous product which is co produced with the oil. In practice, this may be a gaseous hydrocarbon such as methane andlor ethane, or in appropriate situations carbon dioxide or nitrogen. When the oil well is an on shore well, the feed water is likely to be raw river water or mains water from some similar fresh water source or possibly water produced from a well drilled specifically for the purpose. On shore, the displacing gas may be natural gas from the well itself, or coproduced nitrogen and or carbon dioxide, or nitrogen and or carbon dioxide produced or imported specifically for injection purposes.With an off shore well, the most convenient source of water for injection is sea water and the most convenient displacing gas will be a gaseous stream from the well, if available, especially Co produced natural hydrocarbon gas. If desired, the water after deaeration may be mixed with water co produced in the well before it is injected into the oil bearing formation although in general it is preferred not to inject co produced water since such water normally requires some form of treatment, e.g. fine filtration, before it is suitable for use in this way. With conventional deaeration of water, an oxygen scavenger is often added to the deaerated water or to the water during deaeration in order to remove as much as possible of the residual oxygen. Thus sea water which initially contained a few ppm of oxygen, say 10 ppm, and which has been conventionally deaerated to a value of say 0.5 ppm, may be treated with an oxygen scavenger in order to lower further the oxygen concentration. It is believed that, using the method of the present invention, it may well be economical to deaerate by physical methods to an oxygen concentration level which is already acceptable, thus avoiding the need of a chemical scavenger in many situations. The specific surface area of the high surface area rotor used in the process of the present invention may usefully be at least 30m2 m3, for example 100 to 500m2 m3, and may advantageously be greater than l,00Om2 m3, especially greater than 1,500m2 3. The rotor may take any of a variety of forms. For example, we have described such rotors in European Patent Specifications Nos.0,002,568, 0,020,055 and 0,023,745 and in numerous, as yet unpublished, pending UK patent specifications which we have filed. The rotor may consist of a plurality of axially spaced discs in generally parallel alignment, for example each lying at right angles to the axis of rotation of the rotor. The discs may be selfsupporting or supported. Conveniently the discs may be of a metal chosen taking into account the particular application envisaged. Typically, such discs may be of the order of 0.05 to 2.0 mm, especially 0.25 to 1.0 mm, thickness and may be spaced about 0.5 to 5 mm, especially 0.5 to 2 mm, apart. Another suitable form of rotor consists of a plurality of plates, generally radially disposed in planes parallel to the axis of rotation or disposed at an angle to such planes and or to the radius. Typically, such plates may be of the order of 0.05 to 2.0 mm, especially 0.25 to 1.0 mm, thickness and may be spaced apart by a distance of the order of 0.5 to 5 mm, especially 0.5 to 2 mm, at their nearest points, which distance may vary with distance from the axis of rotation. A further form of rotor comprises a permeable element, which may be of unitary construction or assembled, if desired in situ, from a plurality of parts or layers. Thus the element may be of knitted or woven cloth, for example metal cloth a crumpled mesh a random or ordered mat or other mass of fibres, for example metallic fibres, which may if desired be strengthened by sintering or adhesive bonding a sintered mass of metal particles or a reticulated foam. Specific examples of suitable materials include knitted metal cloth, for example that sold under the trade mark Knitmesh , which may for example be wound in layers about a support which surrounds or is located at the axis of rotation of the rotor, and metallic skeletal foams, for example the product sold under the trade mark Retimet , which may conveniently be assembled in layers to form the permeable element. The rotor is rotated at such a speed as to subject the water to an acceleration, expressed in a radial direction, which is greater than the acceleration due to gravity. Since the radial acceleration to which the solution is subjected varies with the distance from the axis of rotation, it is convenient to refer to the mean acceleration am , which is defined by the equation EMI4.1 where N is the rotational speed of the rotor in revolutions per minute, r0 is the distance from the axis of the radially innermost part of the high surface area rotor and rl is the distance from the axis of the radially outermost part of said rotor. The mean acceleration to which the water is subjected is preferably at least 300 m sex 2, especially at least 1,000 m sex 2, and may advantageously be as high as 10,000 m sex 2 or higher. Thus, in terms of the acceleration due to gravity g , the mean acceleration may amount to 30 g or 100 g or 1,000 g or more. The rotational speed at which it is necessary to rotate the rotor in order to achieve acceleration values which are a multiple of that due to gravity is, as is clear from the above equation, dependent only upon reactor dimensions and upon the degree of acceleration selected. Thus with a rotor having an inner radius of 0.15 m and an outer radius of 0.25 m, if it is desired to subject the water to a mean radial acceleration of 700 m sex 2, it is necessary to rotate the rotor at about 550 revs min. If the acceleration is to be about 1,000 m sex 2, then the rotational speed must be of the order of 650 revs min. In general, it is likely that the rotational speed of the rotor employed in the process of the present invention will lie between 50 and 10,000 revs min, for example between 100 and 5,000 revs min and preferably between 500 and 2,000 revs min. The rotor is constructed of any material which combines the characteristics of mechanical strength and corrosion resistance required by the intended conditions of use. Thus for treatment of fresh water, the required characteristics may be met by the use of one of the stainless steels conventionally used in static deaeration equipment. For sea water deaeration, one of the copper based marine alloys, for example an admiralty alloy or a cupro nickel alloy, may be used. Also for sea water, titanium metal is very suitable, as is an alloy of nickel and chromium. In some conditions of use, especially where long exposures to still sea water are not contemplated, some of the stainless steels, such as the 316 type containing chromium, nickel and molybdenum, are suitable. The invention will now be further described by reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates, in vertical section, one form of apparatus suitable for practising the process according to the present invention and Fig. 2 illustrates, also in vertical section, another form of suitable apparatus.In the two figures, the same reference numerals are used for corresponding parts, Full line arrows indicate liquid flow and broken line arrows indicate gas flow. Referring firstly to Fig. 1, a rotor 10 is mounted upon a shaft 11 by means of which it is rotated within a squat cylindrical chamber 12. The rotor 10 carries an annular permeable member 13, assembled from concentric layers of the metallic skeletal foam sold under the trade mark Retimet . The member 13 in the illustrated embodiment is of a nickel chromium alloy and has a specific surface area of 2,600m2 m3. Water containing 9 ppm of dissolved oxygen is introduced via water feed pipe 14 and in turn via apertures near the lower end of the pipe 14 to the inner cylindrical face of the permeable member L3, whence it permeates, under the centrifugal effect of the rotation of the rotor 10, through the pores of the member 13 towards its outer face. Within the member 13, the water is subjected to a mean centrifugal acceleration of approximately 50 times the acceleration due to gravity. A gas mixture containing 85 per cent by weight of methane and 15 per cent by weight of ethane is introduced to the chamber 12 via gas feed pipe 15 under sufficient pressure to cause it to enter the member 13 via its outer cylindrical face. The gas flows in a generally inward direction through the pores of the permeable member 13, countercurrent to the flow of water. Within the pores, the gas liquid contact takes place by means of which oxygen is transferred from the water to the gas phase. The gas emerges from the inner face of the member 13 and is removed via gas discharge pipe 16. wDeaerated water containing 0.1 ppm of oxygen leaves the member 13 via its outer face and is withdrawn from chamber 12 via liquid discharge pipe 17. In order to maintain the small positive gas pressure in the chamber 12, a liquid seal 18 surrounds the lower end of the pipe 16 and a liquid lute not shown is included in the liquid line from pipe 17. The apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2 differs from that ofFig 1 in that it has a rotor 19 in the form of a stack of axiallyspaced plates 20. In the drawing, for the sake of clarity, only a few plates are shown however the plates 20 in the illustrated embodiment are in fact 0.5 mm thick and spaced 1 mm apart. Thus in a stack of plates of, say 80 mm total axial length there are 54 plates. The specific surface area of the stack is therefore approximately 1,350m2 m3. The apparatus of Fig. 2 operates in substantially the same manner as that of Fig. 1, except that the gas water contact takes place upon the surfaces of the plates 20 and to some extent in the space between the plates.
