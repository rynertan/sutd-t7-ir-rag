# Reactive polymers for dermal and transdermal therapy.

## Abstract
Reactive polymers are described for the cure of skin affections, consisting of cross linkable polyuretanes having film building properties and suitable to be applied to skin wounds of any nature. The described formulations are generally constituted by two components to be mixed at the use moment, so that the cross linkage mostly happens by interaction with the proteic components of the treated skin parts. These formulations are also good carriers for transdermal action drugs.
