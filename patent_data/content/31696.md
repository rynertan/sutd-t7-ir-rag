# Process for the preparation of vanadium phosphorus catalysts, catalysts so prepared, use of these catalysts for the production of maleic anhydride and maleic anhydride so produced.

## Abstract
A problem which occurs in the production of an oxidation catalyst containing vanadium and phosphorus is recovery of the catalyst precursor prior to calcination. Such a catalyst is made by a process which involves a introducing pentavalent vanadium compound into an or ganic liquid capable of at least partially solubilizing and cap able of reducing vanadium to a valence state less than 5 to form a reaction medium b effecting reduction of at least a portion of said vanadium to a valence state of 4 c removing unsolubilized vanadium containing compounds having a particle size greater than about 0.1 mm diameter d adding a pentavalent phosphorus containing compound to the reaction medium resulting from step c to form a cata lyst precursor precipitate e recovering said catalyst precursor precipitate f drying said catalyst precursor precipitate g calcining said precipitate to form the active oxidation cata lyst. In this process the recovery of catalyst precursor is facili tated since it is obtained as a precipitate, and the catalyst precursor when made by the process is more readily tabletted than before calcination. The catalyst also has an improved yield and selectivity in the conversion of 4 atom hydrocarbons to maleic anhydride.
