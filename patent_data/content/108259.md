# Method for controlling vertically arranged heaters in a crystal pulling device.

## Abstract
In the pulling of a single crystal from a melt by the Czochralski method the temperature of the melt and the crystal is controlled by a plurality of heaters surrounding the crucible in vertically disposed relation relative to each other. The lowermost heater is controlled by an automatic tempera ture controller in response to the temperature of the bottom of the crucible and the remaining heaters are controlled by the selectring a specific ratio for the power supply of each of the remaining heaters with respect to the power supply of the lowermost heater.
