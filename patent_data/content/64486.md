# Method and apparatus for the hydrolysis of alpha chlorinated toluene compounds.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a continuous method and an apparatus for the hydrolysis of α chlorinated toluene com pounds, preferably benzyl chloride. The hydrolysis, which takes place in a hydrolysis zone 3 , is characterized by being conducted in countercurrent between the aqueous phase containing the hydrolyzing agent and the organic phase containing the α chlorinated toluene compound and an inert organic solvent, such as toluene. After the hydrolysis, the organic phase is washed with water in a washing zone 2 , while the aqueous phase is extracted with inert solvent in an extraction zone 4 . The resulting product of hydrolysis, preferably benzyl alcohol, is thereafter separated from the organic phase by distillation, suitably in two stages, by means of two distillation columns 17, 31 connected in series.
