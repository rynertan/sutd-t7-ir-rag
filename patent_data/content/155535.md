# AZETIDINE 2,4 DIONES AS CATALYSTS FOR CAPROLACTAM POLYMERIZATION

## Abstract
An improved process for the anionic polymerization of lactams is described. Particular azetidinedione compounds are employed as promoters and their use not only permits low polymerization temperatures but gives rise to faster polymerization reactions than prior art procedures allow. The rapid polymerisation of caprolactam in accordance with the present invention makes the process particularly suited to RIM procedures for preparing molded polyamides.
