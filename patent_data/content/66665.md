# ACTIVATED MAGNESIUM OXIDE CATALYSTS

## Abstract
Catalysts comprising magnesium oxide, sulfate ions and amorphous metal ions including titanium are improved in activity by undergoing a wet grinding step. The level of water in the wet grinding step is critical to achieve full activity. The water may subsequently be removed by calcining and is necessarily present only during the wet grinding step.
