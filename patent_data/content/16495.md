# Process for the preparation of methane and ethane and methane and or ethane so prepared.

## Abstract
A mixture of methane and ehtane is prepared from C₂ ₄ paraffins of which the average numbers of carbon atoms is at least 0.5 higher, by contacting the paraffins at a pressure above 10 bar with ZSM 5 having an Al₂O₃ SiO₂ molar ratio of at least 0.005.
