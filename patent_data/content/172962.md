## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to new prostaglandin D analogues, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Prostaglandins are derivatives of prostanoic acid having the following structure EMI1.1 Various types of prostaglandins are known, and their types depend on the structure of the alicyclic ring and the substituents. For example, the alicyclic rings of prostaglandins F PGF , E PGE and D PGD have the following structures, respectively EMI2.1 In the above structural formulae or in the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the dotted line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i.e. is of the a configuration, the bold line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in front of the ring plane, i.e. is of the B configuration, and the wavy line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is of the a configuration or the ss configuration or a mixture thereof. These compounds are sub classified according to the positions of the double bonds in the side chains attached to the alicyclic ring at the 8 position and the 12 position.The PG 1 compound has a trans double bond trans 13 between C13 Cl4 and PG 2 compound has a cis double bond between C5 C6 and a trans double bond between C13 C14 cis n 5 trans t13 For example, prostaglandin D1 PGD1 and prostaglandin D2 PGD2 may be expressed by the following structural formulae, respectively EMI3.1 Further, when one or more methylene groups are removed from the aliphatic group attached at the 12 position of the alicyclic ring of a prostaglandin, said compound is known as a nor prostaglandin according to the general rule of the organic nomenclature, and the number of the removed methylene groups is indicated by adding di , tri , etc. before the prefix nor . The prostaglandins generally have pharmacological properties. For example, they exert various effects, including the stimulation of contraction of smooth muscles, a hypotensive effect, a diuretic effect, a bronchial dilation effect, the inhibition of lipolysis, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, they are useful in treatments of hypertension, thrombosis, asthma and gastric and intestinal ulcers, in the induction of labour and abortion in pregnant mammals, in the prevention of arteriosclerosis and also as diuretics. They are liposoluble substances present in extremely small quantities in the tissues which secrete prostaglandins in vivo in animals. As a result of research and experimentation to discover novel compounds which have the pharmacological effects of the natural prostaglandins, or which have one or more of these properties to an enhanced degree, or which have properties which are not found in the natural prostaglandins, it has been discovered that certain novel PGD analogues which are obtained by the dimerization, by an optional combination, of PGD1 and PGD2, compounds in which the carboxyl group attached to the l position thereof is replaced by a carbamoyl group PGD amide compounds , compounds in which the hydroxy group attached to the 9 position of the said PGD compounds or PGD amide compounds is dehydrated to introduce a double bond between Cg C10 9 deoxy 9 PGD compounds , and further compounds in which the hydroxy group attached to the 15 position of the said 9 deoxy 9 PGD compounds is dehydrated to introduce double bonds between C12 C13 and C14 Cl5, have strong specific anti tumor effect. Heretofore, there have been filed several patent applications relating to PGD analogues see European PatentPublication Nos. 97023, 98141, 99672 and 99673 . However, the dimers of PGD analogues of the present invention are completely novel derivatives which are so far undiscovered and which are unexpected by the conventional techniques. Furthermore, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention have the effect of increasing the number of white blood cells in vivo and have a synchronization effect on the cell cycle of tumour cells.

According to the present invention, the PGD analogues of the general formula I , wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined can be prepared by reacting the PGD analogues of the general formula EMI11.6 whereinEMI11.7 is as hereinbefore defined with the compounds of the general formulae HO CH2 n OH VI H2N CH2 n OH VII or 2N CH2 n NH2 VIII wherein n is as hereinbefore defined to obtain a compound of the general formula EMI12.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined and then reacting the resulting compound of general formula IX with the PGD analogues of the general formula EMI12.2 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined . The reaction of the compounds of the general formula V with the compounds of the general formula VI , VII or VIII can be conducted by reacting the compounds of the general formula V with isobutyl chloroformate or trimethylacetyl chloride in an inert organic solvent, for example, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or NtN dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine, at a temperature of from OOC to room temperature, to form an anhydrous acid mixture of the compounds of the general formula V , and by reacting it with the compounds of the general formulae VI , VII or VII I at a temperature of from OOC to room temperature. This sequence of the reaction steps is hereinafter referred to as Reaction A . In this reaction, it is preferable that the compounds of the general formulae VI , VII or VIII exceed in quantity the compounds of the general formula V , preferably at the rate of 8 to 12 mols of the former to 1 mol of the latter. The compound of general formula IX is then reacted with the compounds of the general formula X under the conditions for Reaction A described hereiflbefore.In this case, it is advisable to use the compounds of the general formula x and compounds of the general formula IX at the rate of 1 mol of the former to 0.5 to 1.0 mols of the latter.
