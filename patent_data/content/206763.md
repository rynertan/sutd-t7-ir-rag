# DIGITAL ELECTRONIC MULTIPLIER CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A multiplier formed as a single integrated circuit chip generates in consecutive clock cycles the single precision partial products of multiple precision operands. Provision of an on chip temporary register and wrap back path avoids transmitting and externally storing intermediate results so that no clock cycles are used solely for data transfer or other overhead . Consecutive double precision multiplications can be performed concurrently so that complete quadruple pre cision products are generated every four cycles.
