# A method for stabilizing tissue plasminogen activator and a stable aqueous solution or powder containing the same.

## Abstract
A method for stabilizing a tissue plasminogen activator which involves adding to an aqueous solution or powder containing a tissue plasminogen activator an effective amount of a purified gelatin is disclosed. A stable aqueous solution or powder which contains a tissue plasminogen activator and an effective amount of a purified gelatin is also disclosed. The method and composition eliminate the prob lem of adsorption of tissue plasminogen activator to various laboratory equipment, and also prevent the conversion of the single chain tissue plasminogen activatgor into a double chain tissue plasminogen activator.
