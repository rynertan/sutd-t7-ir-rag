# FLEXIBLE BACKING MATERIAL FOR USE IN COATED ABRASIVES

## Abstract
A flexible sheet material characterised in that it com prises a a straight warp fabric comprising i an array of warp yarns that extend generally parallel to one another in a first plane ii an array of weft yarns that extend generally parallel to one another in a second plane adjacent and parallel to the first plane, the weft yarns extending generally transversely of the warp yarns and iii a stitching yarn network joining the array of warp yarns and the array of weft yarns to one another b a dipsize of flexible polymeric material that coats and at least partially impregnates all yarns of the straight warp fabric c an intermediate filling coat of phenol formaldehyde resin latex d an outer filling coat of phenol formaldehyde resin and e an adhesive coat overlying the outer filling coat securing abrasive grains the sheet material exhibiting not more than 6.0 percent elongation in the direction of the warp yarns when subjected to a load less than that required to rupture the fabric and not exceeding 170 pounds per inch 30 kg per cm of fabric width is disclosed. A flexible sheet material characterised in that it com prises a a straight warp fabric comprising a warp side and a weft side all yarns of the fabric comprising a penetrating dipsize of flexible polymeric material and the dipsized fabric being heat set b a backfill filling the interstices and encapsulating the yarns of the warp yarn array of the base coated fabric, the backfill comprising approximately equal parts, by weight, of finely divided calcium carbonate and finely divided magnesium carbonate dispersed in a flexible synthetic polymer resin c a backsizing applied to the warp side of the back filled fabric, the backsizing comprising a synthetic heat reac tive polymer latex and finely divided calcium carbonate filler in about 1 1 ratio on a dry weight basis d a facefilling applied to the weft yarn side of the fabric comprising a phenolic resin having a calcium carbonate filler dispersed therein is also disclosed. Such materials are particularly suitable flexible backing materials for use in coated abrasives and offer advantages over the prior art.
