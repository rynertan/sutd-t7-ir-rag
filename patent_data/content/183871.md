# Two way cable television system.

## Abstract
A tree type two way data communication system for use in a cable television system comprises a plurality of interface subsystems, each of them capable of receiving digital command signals, wherein each of said subsystems verifies data format and regenerates and forwards at least some of said digital commands as packet signals towards a head end subsystem, said head end subsystem receiving said packet signals and developing response signals.
