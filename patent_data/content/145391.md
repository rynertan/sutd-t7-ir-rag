# Adhesive resin composition.

## Abstract
An adhesive resin composition comprises 40 to 80 parts by weight of A a thermoplastic copolyester resin prepared from 1 a dicarboxylic acid component comprising from 40 to 100 mol of terephthalic acid and from 0 to 60 mol of another aromatic dicarboxylic acid e.g. isophthalic and 2 a low molecular weight glycol component comprising 40 to 100 mol of 1,4 butanediol and 0 to 60 mol of diethylene glycol or 1,6 hexanediol, and optionally 0 to 10 mol of the total carboxylic acid of polytetramethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 600 to 6,000, which has a melting point of 90 to 160 C and a reduced viscosity of at least 0.5 and B an ethylene copolymer having at least one epoxy, carboxylic acid or dicarboxylic anhydride functional group and optionally C a thermoplastic resin other than the resin A , and further optionally D a polyfunctional epoxy com pound. The composition contains by wt, 40 to 80 of A and 60 to 20 of B C and up to 20 parts of D per 100 of A , B and C . This composition exhibits excellent adhesion to syn thetic resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polyesters and polyolefins and also to metals such as aluminium and has excellent adhesive durability against moisture.
