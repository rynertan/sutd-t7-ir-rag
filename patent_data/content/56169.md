# Water tight seal between two concrete elements.

## Abstract
A watertight seal between two adjoining channel shaped concrete elements 2 has an elastic sealing strip 3 sandwiched between a socket 5 of one concrete element 2 and a wedge 4 of the other concrete element 2 enveloped by the socket 5 . The sealing strip 3 is recessed and has a transverse profile such, that when the socket 5 is slid over the wedge 4 , material 12 of the sealing strip 3 shifts in a direction contrary to movement of the socket 5 in order to prevent damage of the sealing strip 3 .
