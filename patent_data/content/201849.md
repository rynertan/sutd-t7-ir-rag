## Description
The present application relates to an apparatus and a method for dimensional analysis or continuously produced tubular object in a non contacting manner over a wide range of temperatures around room temperature to around 1600 C by means of penetrating radiation and computer processed modelling algorithms. US A 4,284,895 describes an apparatus for examining at least part of an object using penetrating radiation, said apparatus comprising The above mentioned US patent describes a method for examining at least part of an object using penetrating radiation, said method comprising the following steps US A 4,284,895 is mainly directed to a scintillator means which is self collimating, and to special embodiments of such a scintillator means. Due to the construction of the scintillator means, very accurate measurements of the wall thickness of a tubular object are possible. However, many measurements are necessary in case that such measurements are used to detect falls in the tube dimensions or flaws because each measurement only gives information of the tube properties along one single path of radiation. US A 4,393,305 describes an apparatus and a method using at least four distinct measuring points and at least five radiation beam points. The different measurements are intercorrelated with each other. Due to this intercorrelation, more information is gained from a measurement as when using a measurement only for determining the tube properties along the measurement paths. The number of measuring points and arrangements of beam paths are selected so that a set of simultaneous equations using the measured data can be solved. It is an objective of the present application to provide an apparatus and a method allowing to determine the cross sectional properties of a tubular or cylindrical object by only a few measurements. The apparatus of the present invention is comprising the features as listed above and is characterized in that for determining cross sectional properties of a tubular or cylindrical object , said processing means are arranged to compute, from the average density signals, values of parameters such as interior and exterior dimensions, excentricity, and weight per unit length of a model describing the cross sectional properties of said object. The method of the present invention comprises the steps a to d as listed above, and is characterized in that for determining cross sectional properties of a tubular or cylindrical object, values of parameters such as interior and exterior dimensions, excentricity, and weight per unit length of a model describing the cross sectional properties of said object are calculated from said density signals. The apparatus and the method of the present invention make use of the physical mathematical knowledge that, when having a mathematical model of a physical object, it is only necessary to provide as many measurements as the model contains parameters, to fully solve the mathematical equation of the model. In case of a tube, interior and exterior dimensions, excentricity and weight per unit length e.g. are sufficient to fully describe the cross sectional properties of the tube. In other words, seven parameters 2 diameters, 2x 2 center coordinates, and weight per unit lengths are sufficient to describe the model. With seven independent measurements, the values of all seven parameters can be determined. As soon as the parameters of the model are known, cross sectional properties of the tube can be calculated for each point of the cross section it is not necessary to provide a measurement for each point of which the cross sectional property should be known. When knowing of the cross sectional property of the tubular or cylindrical object, it is easily possible to detect dimensional faults or flaws. For such a purpose, it is only necessary to compare values calculated from the solved model equation with expected values. As soon as the differences between the calculated and expected values exeed a threshold, there is an unallowable dimensional fault or flaw. In the drawings FigS. 1 and 2 , the apparatus A for the dimensional analysis of and flaw detection in tubular products P, such as seamless or welded pipe, has at least two, and preferably three, coplanar gamma ray sources S mounted at regular intervals on a baseplate B about an opening in its center through which the tubular product P can continuously travel. Each of the sources S transmits a fan beam through the product P to a detector array R of closely packed detectors D also mounted on the baseplate B directly opposite the source S. A parallel plate collimator 1 is placed in front of the detector array R to define the thickness of the fan beam. The detector arrays R are oriented relative to the sources to maximize the detection of the portion of the gamma ray photons which have passed through the product P without being absorbed, reemitted or scattered at angles greater than a few degrees as a result of collisions with the atoms of the material forming the product P. These photons will hereinafter be described as primary photons 2. The portion of the penetrating radiation either absorbed or deflected from the original paths to travel in any direction from the point of deflection along secondary paths are hereinafter described as secondary photons 4. Reproducible beam optics for the apparatus A are provided by mounting the three sources S and their associated detector arrays R on a stiff support structure which can also function as a precision template for orienting the sources S and detector arrays R. A suitable support structure B is a 3.81 cm thick cast aluminum baseplate. The support structure B, in turn, may be mounted to an external structure, for example, by four 25.4 cm wide by 7.62 cm section aluminum channel beams not shown . The locations of the sources S and detectors D thus can be controlled to an accuracy of 0.00254 cm at 25 The detectors D detect individual primary photons 2 which have passed through the product P from the source S along a plurality of paths which are substantially perpendicular to the surface of the detectors D directed at the source S. The detectors, however, may also detect unwanted secondary photons 4 which have been deflected from other paths. Although the detector array R and detectors D are designed to maximize the detection of primary radiation and minimize the detection of such secondary photons, these secondary photons may still have sufficiently high energies although lower than the primary photon energies to reduce the effectiveness of prior self collimating detectors. This is primarily true when the dominant interaction process for generating secondary photons is Compton scattering rather than the photoelectric effect. The detectors D transmit an analog signal representative of the individual photons both primary and secondary detected to a discriminator subassembly E Fig. 3 which utilizes a novel discrimination technique to reject most of the remaining signals caused by detected secondary photons i.e. all signals below a threshold level . The discriminator subassemblies E for the detectors D packed in a particular array R may be placed on suitable electronic boards or cards and slotted into suitable enclosures B. The threshold level setting for each individual discriminator is controlled by means of a threshold signal generated in a digital to analog converter 26 based on data received from the computer C. The computer C selects the threshold level signal for each individual discriminator subassembly E so that the actual count rate is a constant fraction of the count rate at which individual primary photons enter the detector. This adjustment is made when there is no product present between the sources S and detector arrays R. The remaining primary photon signals from each discriminator subassembly E are counted and transmitted through a series of temporary storage buffers for temporary storage of the signals received from each of the detectors D during a predetermined sampling period, 10 milliseconds for example. After a very short time interval, 10 milliseconds for example, the signals are fed to the computer C for storage and processing. The computer C then processes the data from the detectors to determine the density of the product P along each of the various paths the photons traveled through the entire cross section of the product P. The computer C then utilizes a novel computer program which implements a novel modeling algorithm to generate high precision dimensional measurements of the product P with projections from only a few angles. In particular, the data is used to generate seven parameters, which parameters, in turn can be used to determine outside diameter, wall thickness, ovality, eccentricity and weight per unit length. The data then can be converted into various forms by conventional methods, such as numerical data, graphs or displays, for output on various types of output devices O. The design parameters typically utilized in medical applications and in most industrial applications are limited to low density objects and are unsuitable for the successful application of computed tomography to the nondestructive evaluation of dense tubular products, such as seamless or welded pipe, during the production of such product on a continuous basis. The most significant difference in the scanning of dense inanimate objects is the necessity of using high energy photons, typically from a few hundred kiloelectron volts Kev to several million electron volts Mev , in order to obtain sufficient penetration of the product P to yield a sufficiently high number of primary photon signals and thereby an adequate signal to noise ratio. The use of such high energy sources, in turn, cause beam hardening, when polychromatic sources such as X ray tubes are employed, and the creation of numerous secondary photons 4 through Compton scattering, which may lead to unwanted detection of secondary photons 4 by the detectors D. Methods currently used to reduce the amount of secondary photons 4 detected or to process detector signals to correct for the effects of such secondary radiation on the detectors, while satisfactory for low energy radiation, are inadequate for the examination of dense objects by high energy radiation sources. Historically, mechanical collimators have been placed in front of detectors to limit the amount of secondary radiation detected. In addition, signals representative of secondary radiation can be measured using certain electronic calibration techniques and subtracted from the initial group of detector signals to achieve a high degree of scatter rejection, as exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 3,937,965. Other more recent methods and apparatus are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,284,895 wherein certain types of materials, such as scintillating plastic, can be configured into special geometric shapes and lined with relatively thin dense materials, such as lead foil, to shield the scintillators from secondary radiation such that the scintillators also act as collimators. While each of these methods is adequate in many cases, each has substantial drawbacks or inadequacies in the discrimination of secondary photons in the high energy range where Compton scattering is the dominant interaction process. For example, the longer detector length required for efficient detection at these energies substantially increases the amount of scattered radiation potentially entering each detector. The larger amounts of shielding and or collimation required to suppress scatter detection in this high energy range also substantially reduce the total active detection area that can be exposed to the source. This loss in the percentage of the detection area available for detecting photons is especially severe for smaller apertures, since the shielding width needed is constant. Further, the presence of collimators and shielding of greater width than the detection area of the detectors prevents detector configurations in which at least one detector in a closely packed detector array in the plane receives primary photons from each portion of the cross section of the product under examination. Since such closely packed detector configurations are required for complete 100 inspection of an object for flaws in certain high speed inspection tasks, this limitation is a severe one. Correction of the detector signal by a value determined by calibration techniques also has substantial disadvantages in some cases. In addition to the extra processing time or circuitry involved, such correction always leaves a residue of extra noise even when the correct average value is subtracted. In cases such as a thick flat edge where the scattering from adjacent detectors into a detector produces a much larger signal than that resulting from direct transmission through the object, the residual noise can greatly diminish the accuracy with which the object s physical properties can be determined. A more recent approach to scatter rejection is exemplified by the discrimination technique disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 4,284,895. In that discrimination technique, a discriminator evaluates the signal generated and rejects signals below a certain threshold representative of secondary photons. A scaler following the discriminator counts those photons whose signal indicates that they came from primary photons. This last approach also appears at first to be unpromising at the photon energy levels at which the creation of secondary photons is predominantly caused by Compton scattering rather than by the photoelectric effect due to the following In summary, previous tomographic scanners are limited to the nondestructive evaluation of low density tubular products because Considering the present invention in more detail Figs. 1 and 2 , the problems discussed above have been solved by selecting the source S to meet specific energy and spectral characteristics optimized for the density of the material being inspected and by using a modified version of the photon counting, discrimination detector system disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,437,006. More specifically, it has been found that in order for the photon counting detector system to fully discriminate against scattered photons, the sources used must emit a group of photons with energies of at least several hundred Kev which fall within an energy range that varies by no more than 15 , and is at least 50 more energetic than any other significant group of photons emitted at lower energies. Two gamma ray sources, Co 60 50 at 1173 Kev, 50 at 1332 Kev and Cs 137 100 at 662 Kev , fit this description fully, whereas Ir 192, with three groups of photon energies emitted 67 at 310 Kev, 25 at 470 Kev and 8 at 605 Kev , does not. Thus sources S of Co 60 or Cs 137 are preferably used in sizes such that the required count rate of the detectors is no more than 10 megahertz MHz . High energy photons from such sources S lose substantial energy when they scatter at angles of more than 45 degrees. For instance, the 1332 Kev photons from Co 60 lose 754 Kev in a 60 degree scattering. The Preferably, the Source S is located in a source housing 6 having a suitable aperture through which the radiation is emitted. A fan collimator 8 of conventional design may be disposed about the source housing 6 to collimate the radiation to form a fan beam. The detector array R of detectors D of the present invention may be constructed with substantially the same materials and in substantially the same way as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,437,006, except as otherwise noted below. The detectors D are preferably formed of blocks of scintillating plastic 10, such as NE 102 manufactured by Nuclear Enterprises. Each block or strip of scintillating plastic is also preferably 150 mm long and 4 mm wide. The lead absorption lining previously placed between the blocks of scintillating plastic 10 are no longer necessary in most applications of the apparatus of the present invention. The elimination of the lining also allows the scintillators to be packed more closely together, thereby allowing the receipt of more information about the product per projection. If a lining is used, a tungsten rather than a lead absorption lining is perferably disposed between the lateral surfaces of adjacent blocks of scintillating plastic due to the high energy photons being used. Thus, these scintillators may be made suitable for use over a broad band of source energies from a few Kev to several Mev. Due to the rapid decay time of such fast scintillating plastic, the gamma ray photons detected by the scintillator will each generate a bundle of light photons. These bundles of light photons are then optically coupled to a photomultiplier 12 through a clear non scintillating light pipe 14. The photomultiplier, in turn, generates an analog signal having an intensity proportional to the intensity of the light photons detected. Hence, the photomultiplier 12 generates a signal of varying magnitude which has peaks associated with the bundles of light photons. The signal from the photomultiplier 12 is electrically coupled to a novel discriminator subassembly E Fig. 3 . The discriminator subassembly electronically measures the magnitudes of the electrical impulses from the photomultiplier 12 and generates output pulses when the intensity of the input pulses are above a threshold level and then counts the output pulses above the threshold level to determine the number of primary photons which interacted with the scintillator 10 during a predetermined sampling period, e.g. 10 milliseconds. The use of high energy sources needed for the scanning of dense tubular products presents several problems with existing discriminators. For example, scatter rejection comes at the expense of some efficiency loss because many primary photons will create signals from the photomultiplier smaller than the detection threshold of the discriminator. Thus, it may be desirable due to the limited number of projections obtained for a given product cross section to accept the detection of more scattered photons in order to detect a large percentage of the primary photons. Thus a variable discriminator level for each discriminator is desirable. Moreover, the variation in gain from detector to detector makes it necessary to have individually controlled threshold settings on the discriminators. Due to these problems, the discriminator subassembly E is preferably constructed of a novel pulse amplifier 16, which also functions as a current to voltage converter, in order to generate well formed pulses of the right magnitude within the fast response time required by a closed loop discriminator 18 for it to properly function without inducing oscillations in the discriminator 18 or amplifying noise in the input signal from the photomultiplier 12. The discriminator 18 generates digital signals in response to pulses from the pulse amplifier 16 that exceed an analog threshold level signal provided to the discriminator by a digital to analog converter DAC 26. The digital output pulses from the discriminator 18 are coupled to a suitable conventional scaler 19. The scaler 19 counts the pulses received from the discriminator 18 and temporarily stores a digital signal representative of the total count within the sampling period in an output buffer internal to the scaler 19. This scaler signal represents the number of primary photons detected by the detector D in a given sampling period. A LSI 7061 integrated circuit manufactured by LSI Computer Systems, Inc., of Melville, New York, may be adapted for use as a suitable scaler 19. The threshold signal is generated by the DAC, based upon a predetermined input reference voltage received at input 28 and an input value signal for the particular detector discriminator channel provided by the Computer C. An AD7528JM integrated circuit manufactured by Analog Devices of Norwood, Massachusetts, may be adapted for use as a suitable digital to analog convertor 26. The computer transmits this input value signal through a serial data bus 30 to an interface 32 which then converts the serial data signal to a parallel data signal for transmission to the DAC over parallel data bus 34. The DAC needs this input value signal in order to generate the threshold signal for the discriminator 18. The computer selects the input value signal for each individual detector so that the actual count rate is a constant fraction of the count rate at which individual primary photons enter the detector. This adjustment is made when there is no product present between the source and detector. Considering the discriminator subassembly E in more detail Fig. 4 , the analog pulse signals from each photomultiplier 12 are coupled to the pulse amplifier 16 through a low impedance output matching network 20 of conventional design electrically connected to an input matching network 22 through a co axial cable 24. To achieve the necessary response time, it is necessary to terminate the anode of the photomultiplier in a low resistance, typically 75 ohms. Accordingly, 75 ohms was selected as the impedance of the matching networks and the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cable. Since the pulse currents from the photomultiplier 12 are usually less than a milliampere, the voltage developed across the matching network 20 is usually less than 100 millivolts, with a significant proportion of the pulses being less than 10 millivolts. The inner conductor of the coaxial cable 24 is electrically connected to resistor 36 of the matching network 22. The other end of resistor 36 is connected to the summing node of a differential operational amplifier 44, which node forms a virtual ground. A resister 38 and capacitor 40 are connected in series between the amplifier side of resistor 26 and a local reference voltage buffer common 42 which is the common ground for all discriminator subassembly channels on the same board or module. This common 42 is also connected to the outer conductor 44 of the cable 24 from the photomultiplier 12. The resistor 38 and capacitor 40 provide temporary charge storage during the initial response lag of the amplifier 16. An HAI 2540 5 integrated circuit manufactured by The Analog Products Division of Harris Semiconducter located in Melbourne, Florida, may be adapted for use as a suitable differential amplifier 44. A resistor 46 and a diode 48 are connected in parallel between the summing node for the amplifier 44 and the amplifier output. Preferably the resistance of the resistor 46 is relatively large, 2K ohms for example. Initially a voltage builds up at the summing node until the amplifier 44 slews to a level at which an equal but opposite current flows through resistor 46 which exactly balances the input current through input resistor 36. For the duration of the remainder of the input current pulse, the summing node voltage is essentially zero. As an equal but opposite current to the input flows through resistor 46, a voltage proportional to the current multiplied by the resistance of resistor 46 is generated by the amplifier at its output. Since resistor 46 is relatively large, a large magnitude voltage pulse appears at the output, greater than four volts, for example. The diode 48 acts as a varactor, thereby providing rapid settling time to the baseline for the pulse tail. As the amplifier output rises at the pulse leading edge, the depletion region of the diode 48 increases, thereby reducing the capacitance and allowing the amplifier to slew faster. At the pulse tail of the signal, the original capacitance of the diode, 3 pF, for example, returns, thereby catching the slew rate and reducing undershoot. In summary, the scintillator generated signals from the photomultiplier 12 are transmitted as current signals to a pulse amplifier 16 with a low impedance input. The pulse amplifier then functions as a current to voltage converter by generating an output signal across a large resistance which is proportional to the current input. The actual output pulses from the amplifier 44, built within the design parameters disclosed herein, are approximately 4 volts with a half height width of 10 to 20 x 10 ⁹ seconds. It should be understood, however, that the preferred voltage output may vary depending upon the particular design of the discriminator 18 and scaler 19 and the count rate of the source S. There are numerous advantages obtained from using pulse amplifier 16 rather than a conventional voltage amplifier to amplify and shape the pulses necessary for the proper functioning of the discriminator 18. For example, to perform threshold discrimination on the pulses from the photomultiplier, it is necessary to employ an extremely fast response voltage comparator in the discriminator 18. A common problem with such comparators is that some of the edge energy from the digital logic output from the discriminator becomes coupled back to the analog inputs of the discriminator, resulting in oscillations. The most common practice to suppress such instability is to incorporate a hysteresis in the circuit design to avoid the condition of having the analog inputs near their linear transform region. To achieve a reasonable degree of system stability, the hysteresis loop magnitude at the discriminator 18 input must be above a minimum determined by the particular discriminator design, 10 millivolts for example. The voltage level from the photomultiplier falls below this minimum a significant portion of the time. Further, it is necessary to locate the discriminator very near the photomultiplier to avoid additional noise detection. This requires the discriminator to be located on the photomultiplier base assembly, an undesirable packaging situation. Additional noise associated difficulties arise in the incorporation of a variable threshold level discriminator design due to the low voltage levels which may occur at the comparator input. One possible solution is to increase the signal level at the input of the discriminator an order of magnitude by either increasing the value of the photomultiplier anode terminator resistance or by amplifying the voltage developed across the terminator. Increasing the terminator resistance to a value sufficient to achieve a photomultiplier output level of at least one volt results in unacceptable pulse tailing. Alternatively, a voltage amplifier for the terminator voltage will work but presents its own set of problems. This amplifier, however, must still be located at the photomultiplier base to avoid cable loss and noise pick up, and noise voltage will be amplified the same as signal voltage. Furthermore, any direct current DC instability in the amplifier output is amplified by the closed loop gain, presenting an offset voltage to the discriminator. In summary, the pulse amplifier 16 provides several advantages over previous systems. First, the pulse amplifier 16 functions as an electrometer, i.e., a current to voltage converter. Induced noise signals tend to be voltage signals. The electrometer configuration results in a maximum voltage gain of unity. Voltage noise is thereby not amplified. Likewise, error due to amplifier input offset voltage is not amplified. Secondarily, noise response is further reduced since noise pick up on the co axial transmission cable is received at the pulse amplifier as a common mode signal to the center conductor and the reference voltage common, which is to a large extent rejected by the differential amplifier 44. The remaining noise is not magnified due to the amplifier having a maximum voltage gain of unity. Finally, the amplifier functions as an active terminator to the transmisssion cable 24. Line termination characteristics are controllable by amplifier damping parameters. As the virtual ground from the summing node is propagated back to the anode of the photomultiplier, the amplifier 16 appears, to an extent, to be located near the photomultiplier anode. Considering the discriminator 18 in more detail Fig. 4 , the output of the pulse amplifier 16 is coupled through a resistor 50 to the noninverting input of a voltage comparator 52. The threshold level signal from the digital to analog converter 26 is coupled through resistor 54 of a voltage divider formed by resistor 54 and resistor 56 to the inverting input of the voltage comparator 52. A suitable voltage comparator may be designed using an AM686HC integrated circuit manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, California which has the circuit equivalent of a Schottky clamped NPN linear front end and a Schottky TTL output stage. If the input voltage level from the pulse amplifier 16 at the noninverting input of the comparator 52 exceeds the minimum threshold voltage signal at the inverting input, the comparator is turned on. A pulse is generated at the comparator true output after a short lag time, e.g. approximately 8 12 x 10 ⁹ seconds. A resistor 58 and capacitor 60 is coupled in series between the not true output and the inverting input in order to provide a positive feedback signal to the inverting input. This feedback signal ensures that the output pulse has the minimum pulse width required by the scaler 19 to count the pulse, 20 x 10 ⁹ seconds. A suitable DC hysteresis, 4 millivolts, is provided through a voltage divider formed by input resistor 50 and resistor 62 connected between the noninverting comparator input and the true output. A diode 64 connected between the noninverting comparator input and a power source, 5 volts for example, prevents the output signal from the pulse amplifier 16, as seen at the input to the comparator 52, from exceeding the power source of the voltage comparator. An input voltage is provided to the voltage comparator at input terminal 65 to inhibit its operation during specified time periods, thereby controlling the sampling period. The positive threshold level signal provided to the discriminator 18 from the DAC 26 has a magnitude determined in accordance with the following formula Thus, the computer C is capable of controlling each detector discriminator channel threshold signal individually. The reference voltage V The discriminator 18 provides for several advantages over prior discriminators. First, it provides closed loop control of the low limit threshold signal. As a result, the discriminator 18 allows for on line dynamic rejection of secondary photon signals, and for periodic automatic equalization of photomultiplier effective gain, without the necessity of varying any photomultiplier parameters, such as high voltage, dynode trim, etc. Another advantage of the discriminator 18 is that it eliminates any requirement for electronic alignment of discriminator threshold levels. This also means that maintenance of the apparatus is simplified since immediate interchange of plug in modules may be done without recalibration. In the preferred embodiment, the following resistors, capacitors and diodes may be used in the construction of the discriminator subassembly E Conventional tomographic reconstruction images of cross sections of objects are normally based on data obtained from several hundred projections of the cross section under examination at numerous angles. While many of the details of conventional CT reconstruction methods are employed in the method of the present invention, other aspects of the methods must be modified in order to generate high precision measurements of the dimensions and density of continuously produced tubular products due to the limited data that can be generated from a few projections of the product P from a limited number of angles as it passes through the scanning apparatus A. Fig. 6b illustrates the radial density profile of a cross section of a perfectly symmetrical tube shown in Fig. 6a, as observed from one angle. The profile will be identical for any other angular projection. For imperfect tube, some information about the imperfections will be contained in the profile at each projection with certain favored projections containing the most information. By choosing two or more regularly spaced projection angles, at least one profile will contain a highly visible anomaly due to the imperfection. For example, a projection profile made from eccentric tube is shown by the dotted line in Fig. 6b. The eccentricity of the tube is evidence from the variation of the peak width and peak height. A flaw in the eccentric tube is also clearly evident as a high frequency fluctuation in the central region of the density profile in Fig. 6b. Density data generated from scans from two or three angles is not enough to calculate a full tomographic reconstruction of high accuracy. In an object of uniform or known density and relatively simple geometry, such as a tubular product, the description of the object can be simplified so that the number of independent variables is reduced to fewer than the number of measurements. A simplified computer implementable model offers the fastest and most accurate method of estimating dimensions from projection measurements. The utility of the model depends on the extent to which the object to be examined can be described by a small number of parameters. A perfect tube could be described by five parameters the two diameters, the density, and the coordinates of the centers of the inside and outside circles forming the tubular product. However, one may also model specific defects. Eccentricity measurements the distance between the centers of the inside and outside circles can be accommodated by two more parameters in the model for a total of seven parameters. The seven parameters needed to describe an eccentric pipe are shown in Fig. 7. The computer program employed in the first embodiment of this invention employs these seven parameters. Considering the computer assisted process in more detail Figs. 3 and 5 , the scaler 19 in each discriminator subassembly E in an array R transmits a digital signal representative of the number of primary photons detected during an exposure through a parallel data bus 66 to an array buffer 68 in response to a control signal from a scanner control circuit 70. After a preselected time to allow each scaler in each array to transmit its data to its array buffer, for example 10 milliseconds, and in response to another control signal from the scanner control 70, all three array buffers transmit all of their data over another parallel data bus 72 to a temporary storage memory 74 where it can be temporarily stored until the computer C can receive it over a CPU data bus 76. Preferably, such signals are transmitted in parallel over both busses to decrease transmission time. Since the signals from each of the detectors D represent the intensity I of the primary radiation passing through a given cross section of the product P along a particular path, the average density or opacity of the product P along any particular path from the source S to a particular detector D in an array R may be represented in accordance with the following conventional formula Pre storage correction of this signal is then accomplished using correction factors experimentally developed for the particular apparatus during test runs without product P in place. These corrections eliminate non linearities in the signals and also eliminate errors resulting from minor misalignments of the sources S and detectors arrays R. Errors caused by the response function of the discriminator subassembly E can also be eliminated at this stage. The corrected signals are then placed into computer storage. If multiple projections are taken, the digital signals for each projection are stored until the end of the examination. After all data from the scanning of a cross section of the product P is stored, the computer C determines the measurements for the particular cross section of the tube in accordance with the steps of a computer program which implements a novel circle calculation algorithm. Considering the novel computer program in more detail, since µ and ρ are known values for the product, the chord length p Fig. 8b also illustrates that the outside curvature of the original density projection forms a graph which can be used to determine whether a chord p Given the data values of the chords p For each fan of measurements, To compute ϑ where with the summations over the N rays which intersect the circle under investigation such that the chord lengths p The three terms K₁, K₂, and K₃ are geometric terms whose values depend only on which rays are in the set of N rays. If a series of partial sums are precomputed for the trigonometric terms, each particular sum can be computed by a single subtraction for the continuous rays of the inner circle or by one addition and two subtractions for the two regions of outside rays . Thus, for example, if Once the value of ϑ With L and ϑ To use all the measurements p An equivalent form that improves computation speed is As described previously, all summations are over the N rays and precomputed partial sums are used to speed the computation. It should be noted that the circle calculation algorithm described above can be easily adapted for use with other types of CT scanning apparatus employing fan or parallel beam radiation sources which are capable of being adapted for measuring the dimensions of nominally circular objects. The processing of density values forming density projections with the use of this circle calculation algorithm provides for numerous advantages over previous methods of measuring the dimensions of tubular products. For example, the noniterative method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,187,425 computes less accurate on line dimensional measurements of continuously produced tubular pipe and is sensitive to movements in the position of the pipe. In addition, known iterative techniques, such as the method of least squares, are also too slow for on line dimensional analysis of continuously produced tubular pipe. In addition, existing circle fitting techniques used in nonrelated technologies are not suitable for determining the dimensions of tubular products. For example, circle fitting techniques have been used in particle physics research to determine the particle track curvature of a particle from specific coordinates of the interaction points of the particle in the surrounding medium, as disclosed in While it is mathematically very convenient to treat the ray measurements as resulting from effects along a single straight line, this is an oversimplification. Both source and detector apertures extend over a finite extent, so the actual path of the penetrating radiation that reaches a detector may have small displacements in position and angle from the average for that detector. This means that measurements cannot give exact dimensions on a particular geometrical line without further processing which would use additional information. This issue is particularly important when high speed examination is needed, because in such a case the source and detectors may be large in order to minimize statistical fluctuations. A method is also used in the invention to convert the measured values of the chords into ideal values the intersection lengths of the central source detector lines and the product under examination. The method makes use of the fact that the product is known to be nearly circular and that an estimate of diameter is available from the expected or nominal values or an earlier iteration. The correction function that converts a measured value into an ideal one is a polynomial in three variables the measured value p One or two iterations of this process alternated with the circle calculation algorithm to improve the estimates of D and L are enough to remove all significant aperture effects. In addition, the use of this algorithm makes the parameter computations insensitive to the exact registration of the product. These two algorithms are employed to compute the desired dimensions of each cross section of the tubular product P in accordance with the following steps For each projection, find the left and right maxima and the left and right extreme points at which the projected mass is significantly above zero. Then identify as outside rays those rays which have some of their components passing through the product but none through the inner cavity. Identify as inside rays those rays which pass through the inner cavity. The rays which pass sufficiently close to the maxima on each side so that only part of their components pass through the inner cavity are not counted in either group. The information required to determine the diameters and the eccentricity and thus the average and minimum wall thickness may be provided by two sets of sources and detector banks. For each fan of measurements provided by such a set, the direct circle calculation algorithm can be applied to give the angular position of the center as seen from the source. The intersection of two lines so determined gives the center locations of outer and inner circles. Combination of the values with the angular width of the projections and the known source positions gives the linear inner and outer diameters as seen from the direction of each source. When more than two source detector sets are used, the major effects are In addition to the estimation of dimensional parameters, the apparatus A can be used to detect pipe flaws such as internal scratches. Although the flaw detection analysis is simpler and faster than the procedure used for dimensional estimation, it is not as precise. Flaw detection consists mainly of detecting high frequency changes in the central portion of the residue of each projection. Since each point on the product is usually in the central 60 percent of at least one of the three projections and the relatively shallow product curvature in that section can be filtered out , this process will detect any flaw of sufficient contrast to its surroundings. The aperture function that describes the area of the device sensitive to the presence of the tube is about 1.27 cm long, along the direction of tube motion. At the maximum speed of 1.52 m per second, data scans are needed every 8 milliseconds plus the exposure time to have all of the pipe examined. In practice, it has been found that any flaws that are relatively long can be detected by less frequent sampling. With the present invention, a manufacturer can perform measurements on many products, including seamless, extruded, stretched or welded steel tube, moving up to five feet per second and vibrating at two to three cycles per second with an amplitude of 1.27 cm. The invention does not require exact positioning of the product P to give accurate measurements. Hollow steel products P of less than 5.1 cm wall thickness can be inspected. Products can be inspected hot, at 1093 In addition, the data also allows for the detection of flaws. For example, 0.254 cm wide flaws with depths of .00762 cm can be reliably detected. Narrower flaws of proportionally greater depth can also be seen.
