## Description
The invention relates to an image enhancement circuit. Such circuits are used to give an image a high quality, starting from a plurality of quasi stationary images of a low quality. For example, let it be assumed that a high quality TV image is desired of an object which is at a long distance from a TV camera. When the atmosphere is quiet as with light frost , this can generally be realised without any additional auxiliary means. However, if the atmosphere is very turbulent as on very hot days an image of a low quality is generally the result, with the desired image being highly degraded by noise. To obtain an image of high quality under such circumstances a plurality of low quality images of this object is processed in the image enhancement circuit. Similar situations occur in scanning electron microscopy, X ray fluoroscopy and in astronomy. A known method of obtaining an image of high quality, starting from a series of low quality images, is described on page 434 of reference 1. In this method the average value is calculated of the series of low quality images. This may lead to the desired result, which is evident as follows. For the i th low quality image there applies For a high value of M the noise term in the right hand member approximates to zero under normal circumstances, so that As a high quality image signal has to be produced within a finite time interval, the number M must be limited. This means that suppression of the noise component is also limit. In practice it turns out that the noise component in the high quality image signal is about 1 M times the original noise component. As described on page 686 of reference 2, a draw back of this image enhancement method is that the desired brightness of the image cannot be obtained until after all M weighted low quality image signals have been accumulated. A further drawback of this known method is that the optimum value for M is not always known in advance. In fact this value will be greatly dependent on the actual circumstances. Another image enhancement method is described in reference 3. To reduce the noise component, it is generally suggested therein that an enhanced image is reconstructed from a series of low quality images G₁, G₂, ... G Still another image enhancement method is described in reference 4. There it is suggested that a prediction image signal is subtracted from each of the successive low quality images signals and that the difference image signal be processed in the way disclosed in reference 1. This means that each difference image signal is multiplied by a weighting factor 1 K and that all weighted difference image signals are accumulated. The accumulated difference image signals constitute the prediction image signal and the desired output image signal. The output image signal will be of high quality only after M successive low quality image signals being processed. In this known method the weighting factor 1 K can have two values. The one value is 1 and is used when the amplitude of the difference image signal is above a predetermined threshold. The other value is some value smaller than 1 which is used when the amplitude of the difference image signal is below that threshold. The disadvantages of the image enhancement methods described in references 3 and 4 is that on the one hand the noise component present in the high quality image signal cannot be reduced to a level below N M wherein N is the noise component present in the original low quality image signal and M is the weighting factor which in the case of reference 3 is equal to two and which in the case of reference 4 is equal to 1 or K. On the other hand, with these image enhancement methods, the maximal noise reduction is obtained after M accumulations only. It is an object of the present invention to provide an image enhancement circuit, of the type disclosed in reference 4, which for converting a series of quasi stationary low quality image signals into a high quality image signal comprises a difference producing circuit receiving the successive low quality image signals of the series and the successive prediction image signals of a series of prediction image signals and producing a series of difference image signals a weighting network receiving the successive difference image signals of said series of difference image signals for multiplying each such difference image signal with a predetermined weighting factor to produce weighted difference image signals, an accumulator circuit for accumulating the weighted difference image signals and producing said series of prediction image signals, but which does not have the drawbacks of the above described circuits. To this end, in the image enhancement circuit according to a first embodiment of the present invention the weighting factor for multiplying the actual difference image signal applied thereto depends upon the ordinal number of that difference image signal in the series of difference image signals, and is equal to the reciprocal value of the ordinal number of that difference image signal. In other words when the ordinal number of the difference image signal is indicated i, the weighting factor of that difference image signal can be set to 1 i, so that the successive weighting factors form the series 1, 1 2,1 3, 1 4, 1 5, 1 6, ... In the image enhancement circuit according to a second embodiment of the present invention the weighting factors are chosen to be equal to integral negative powers of a two, particularly as follows In this equation RND represents a rounding off operation in other words RND ²log i is the rounded off value of ²log i. The weighting factors determined in this manner successively have the value Using such monotonically decreasing weighting factors for the successive difference image signals, the image signal stored in the accumulator will have the optimum brightness at any moment, and the noise component decreases continuously so that the accumulation process may be stopped as soon as the noise component is sufficiently suppressed. It is true that the image enhancement circuit according to the second embodiment theoretically does not yield the same image quality as in the case that k i 1 i, but in practice the difference in quality can hardly be ascertained, also because the accumulation process is not to be stopped after a given period, and the weighting circuit can then considerably be simplified. Fig. 1 shows a TV system. It comprises a TV camera 1 which converts a series of images G The analogue image signals g The time discrete image signals which are supplied by the circuit 2 are applied to the input 31 of the image enhancement circuit 3. The output 32 thereof is connected to the monitor 5 via a digital to analogue converter 4. The image enhancement circuit 3 has an accumulator 33 which in response to the i th image signal g and This weighting network has a weighting factor k i dependent on the ordinal number i of the low quality image signal and with the aid of a switch 36, which can be operated by the user, it can be set to a given starting position and can be maintained in this position if desired, by leaving this switch permanently operated. It will be assumed that the weighting factor in this starting position is equal to k 0 0. Due to the first synchronising pulse f When at a given moment the quality of the image H An embodiment of the weighting circuit 35 in the case where k i 1 i is shown in Fig. 2. It comprises a counter 3501 of, for example, 16 bits. The frame synchronising pulses f It is to be noted that the 2¹⁶ frame synchronising pulses that can be counted by this 16 bit counter correspond to 65536 images. Transmission thereof takes approximately 43 minutes. In this case the user must determine within approximately 43 minutes whether there is animage satisfying his wishes. In the weighting circuit shown in Fig. 2 the starting point is that k i 1 i and that it is therefore provided with a divider circuit 3503. Although divider circuits are generally known, they remain relatively complicated circuits. In addition it takes a relatively long time to carry out a division. A considerably simpler embodiment of the weighting circuit is obtained by choosing the weighting factors to correspond to equation 4 which leads to the series of weighting factors indicated in equation 5 . This choice of the weighting factors does not only considerably simplify the weighting circuit design, but in addition its rate may be considerably higher. An embodiment of the weighting circuit in which the weighting factors thus chosen are used is shown in Fig.3. In this embodiment it has been assumed for the sake of simplicity that both the difference signal samples, which are supplied by the difference producing circuit 34, and the weighted difference signal samples such as are applied by the weighting circuit are all represented in sign and magnitude and are located between 1 and 1. The weighting circuit shown in Fig. 3 again comprises the 16 bit counter 3501 which receives the frame synchronising pulses f It is to be noted that it has been assumed for the sake of simplicity in this embodiment that the different signal samples are represented with sign and magnitude, but that the two complement representation is generally used in practice. It is also to be noted that the element 334 see Fig. 1 which has been indicated as a delay circuit in the foregoing may be designed as a digital image memory.
