# Filter unit.

## Abstract
A filter unit for making coffee, tea or other beverages consists of a filter pouch 12 and a rod 30 for suspending the pouch in a cup or similar container. The pouch has a water permeable bag portion 20 in which ground coffee, tea or other beverage flavoring can be placed, and a mouth portion 19 into which liquid can be poured to filter through the flavoring and through the permeable bag portion into the cup. The mouth portion is stiffer than the bag portion, being reinforced by folding the water permeable material of the pouch onto itself, and holes 18 are pierced through the mouth portion to receive the rod. The rod passes through the holes midway between side edges of the pouch. The holes are slightly larger than the rod and the rod is smooth, and a pouch containing coffee or the like tends to open if the rod is jiggled. The side edges of the pouch diverge upwardly and can engage opposite sides of the cup to press the mouth portion to an open position as the pouch is lowered into the cup. The rod has a pair of smooth knobs 32, 38 which receive the rim 41 of the cup 40 between them to locate the rod transversely of the rim so that the rod supports the pouch in the cup. The pouch is easily dropped off the rod when the filter unit is removed from the cup.
