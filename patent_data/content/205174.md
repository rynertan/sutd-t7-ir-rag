# Dietary food of seaweed having ion exchange capability.

## Abstract
Described is a fibrous dietary food prepared mainly from brown algae by treating them with acids for removing the sodium ions originally contained therein and neutralizing the obtained material with a solution containing potassium, calcium, magnesium and or iron ions to substitute any of the ions for the removed sodium ions and recovering the obtained product in solid form. The obtained products exhibit a more favorable ion exchange capability than natural seaweed and when they are incorporated in the living body, they will decrease the sodium content in the living body and consequently they can be used for the prevention of hypertension and cerebral apoplexy. The obtained products can be used as dietary food either pure or together with other food. They can also be formulated e.g. as tablets, granules and powders in combination with conventional vehicles adopted in the art.
