# COMPOSITION SUITABLE FOR MAKING PLASTIC ARTICLES, METHOD FOR MAKING SAID COMPOSITION AND CURED ARTICLES THEREOF

## Abstract
A mixture of a carboxylic acid and an alkali metal carboxylate group containing rubber in a vinyl monomer is provided. The resulting composition has a relatively low viscosity and is particularly adapted for preparing a thermosettable composition suitable for preparing reinforced plastic articles by combining an unsaturated polyester, the alkali metal carboxylate containing rubber solution containing the carboxylic acid, a catalyst, and a reinforcing agent. The resulting composition when cured exhibits high impact strength and good surface finish.
