# Glass composition suitable for use in a fluorescent lamp.

## Abstract
A new type of glass, for example, for use as TL enve lope glass, which as regards phosphor poisoning and Hg penetration has better properties than the present TL enve lope glasses. Phosphor poisoning occurs in particular upon sealing of the electrodes and bending or severing and bridging, respectively, during the manufacture of SL and PL lamps. The composition of the glass is derived from a glass composition for use in optical glass fibres which is describ ed in European Patent Application 83 200 958. Phosphor poisoning is controlled by restricting the mo bility of sodium ions. This is achieved by choosing the quan tities of the alkali metal oxides within certain limits mixed alkali effect . Hg penetration is controlled by a large quantity of alka line earth metal oxides in the glass. The glass according to the invention has a good light transmission. A lamp comprising a lamp envelope manu factured from a glass according to the invention only shows a small decline of the luminous efficiency during operation of the lamp.

## Description
Glass composition suitable for use in a fluorescent lamp, tube and lamp envelope manufactured from said glass composition, and fluorescent lamp having a lamp envelope manufactured from said glass composition. The invention relates to a glass composition comprising silicon dioxide, at least one alkali metal oxide and at least one oxide selected from the group formed by zirconium dioxide and aluminium oxide, which glass composition furthermore comprises at least two oxides selected from the group formed by zinc oxide ad the alkaline earth metal oxides. The invention further relates to a tube manufactured from such a glass composition. The invention moreover relates to a lamp envelope manufactured from the above mentioned glass composition. The invention also relates to a fluorescent lamp comprising a vacuum tight sealed glass lamp envelope in which two electrodes connected to current supply wires are provided between which a discharge takes place during operation of the lamp, the lamp envelope being filled with a gas atmosphere and a metal which during operation of the lamp at least partly evaporates, a layer comprising at least one phosphor being provided on the inside of the wall of the lamp envelope. The invention relates more particularly to a fluorescent lamp in which the metal which evaporates at least partly during operation of the lamp is mercury. European Patent Application EP 83200958 discloses a glass composition according to the first paragraph of the present specification for use as a core glass in an optical glass fibre. Said core glass does not contain Awl 203 but may contain ZrO2, SrO and Y203. In the same EuropeanPatent Application glass compositions according to the first paragraph of the present specification are described for use as a cladding glass in an optical glass fibre. Said cladding glasses comprise no ZrO2 and no BaO but may comprise Al 203 and B203. Both in the core glass and in the cladding glass it is desired for the quantity of potassium oxide in not. to be less than half of the overall quantity of alkali metal oxides.The glass compositions which are disclosed in the above mentioned European PatentApplication have a number of properties which make them suitable for use in a lamp envelope for a fluorescent lamp.Favourable properties are, for example, a great light transmission, a good processibility and a large corrosion resistance. The glass compositions, to be suitable for use in lamp envelopes of fluorescent lamps, must satisfy a number of additional conditions, for example, as regards the interaction with a phosphor layer. Said conditions impose further restrictions on the quantities of a few components of the glass composition, without impairing the processing properties of the glass. During the manufacture of a lamp as described above, for example, upon sealing and further shaping, the temperature of the glass of the lamp envelope is locally considerably increased, for example, to above 6000C. The prior art glass compositions for use in lamp envelopes for fluorescent lamps comprise sodium oxide to obtain a glass which can readily be processed at not too high a temperature, see, for example United States PatentSpecification 3,094, 641. If such a lamp is provided with a phosphor layer on the inside of the wall of the lamp envelope, the phosphor is contaminated with sodium from the glass of the lamp envelope. As a result of this, the initial luminous efficiency of the phosphor is reduced. During operation of the lamp the luminous efficiency of the phosphor also decreases further in the course of time. It is an object of the invention to provide a fluorescent lamp and a glass composition suitable for use in a lamp envelope for such a lamp, in which the lamp has a high luminous efficiency which during operation of the lamp decreases only slightly with time. A further object of the invention is to provide a mercury vapour fluorescent lamp and a glass composition suitable for use in a lamp envelope of such a lamp, in which the lamp has a luminous efficiency which during operation of the lamp decreases slightly with time. In order to prevent decrease of the light transmission of the glass greying , it is desirable for the glass to withstand penetration of mercury. According to the invention both objects are achieved by a glass composition which consists of 57.5 65 mol. Si02 0 8 mop. Li20 1 6 mop. Na20 8 9 mol. K20 0 8 mop. CaO 0 10 mop, MgO 5.15 mop. BaO 0 6 mol. ZnO 0 0.5 mol. CeO2 0 3 mol. ZrO2 and 0.5 mol. Awl203, the sum of the quantitites of ZrO2 and Al2O3 being 2 6 mol. , the sum of the quantities of alkali metal oxides being 10 15 mol. and the sum of the quantities of ZnO and the total quantity of the alkaline earth metal oxides including MgO being 20 30 mol. . The invention is based on the experimentally found phenomenon that the mobility of alkali metal ions in the glass can be considerably restricted by choosing the quantities of the various alkali metal oxides to be within the above mentioned limits. In order to further restrict the influence of the sodium ions on the phosphor layer, the quantity of sodium oxide is at most 6 mol. . The mobility of the alkali metal ions in the glass is further restricted by choosing, within the glass compositions according to the above mentioned European Patent Application, the total quantity of the alkaline earth metal oxides, including zinc oxide, to be larger than 20 mol. . The penetration of Hg is prevented by the large content of alkaline earth metal oxides in the glass. If the refractory material of the furnace, in which the glass is melted, comprises ZrO2, it is efficacious to choose the quantity of BaO in the glass to be not too large and to use, for example, CaO and MgO to thus diminish wear of the refractory material of the furnace. In order to achieve a good light transmission of the glass, the quantity of iron oxide in the glass should be small, for eample, less than 250 ppm. Iron oxide is usually present in small quantitites in the starting materials from which the glass is prepared. By the addition of CeO2 for example 0.2 mop. to the glass any ferrous oxide present is oxidized to ferric oxide as a result of which the light absorption moves to wavelengths outside the visible range. The mobility of the sodium ions is restricted in particular when the quantity of potassium oxide is large with respect to the quantity of sodium oxide. In a preferred embodiment of the glass composition according to the invention, the glass composition contains 4 5 mol. Thi20 and 1 3 mol. Na2O. In a further embodiment of the glass composition according to the invention the glass composition comprises 0 2 mol. Li20 and 3 4 mop. Na2O. 2 The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to a few examples and a drawing, the sole figure of which is a longitudinal section of an embodiment of a lamp according to the invention, in this case a mercury vapour discharge lamp. The figure shows a lamp comprising a vacuum tight sealed lamp envelope 1. Current supply wires 2 are provided through the wall of the lamp envelope 1 and are connected to electrodes 3. In the embodiment shown, the electrodes 3 are coiled filaments but any further known construction of the electrodes is also suitable. A layer of a phosphor 4 is present on the inner wall of the lamp envelope 1. Some metallic mercury 5 which evaporates after ignition of the lamp is present within the lamp envelope 1. Before use such a lamp is filled, for example,with a gas mixture of 99 by volume of Ne and 1 ffi by volume of Ar at an overall pressure of 730 Pa. A few glass compositions were melted having compositions as recorded in the table hereinafter. The fusion of said glasses was carried out in a platinum crucible in an electric furnace. Starting materials were silica, aluminium oxide, zirconium dioxide, cerium oxide, zinc oxide and the carbonates of calcium, barium, magnesium, lithium, sodium and potassium in so far as these metals were present in the examples . No particular problems occurred during the fusion and further processing. Lamps having lamp envelopes manufactured from glasses having a composition according to the table have a good luminous efficiency and a long life. Measurements of the Hg content of the glass after 600 and 1600 hours operation of the lamp demonstrated that the Hg content was a factor of 2 to 3 times lower than after the same duration in prior art lamps. After 2000 hours in operation no discolouring of the glass of the lamp occurred. The sodium content of the phosphor is approximately a factor of 2 lower than in prior art lamps. After 5000 hours in operation the luminous efficiency of the phosphor of the lamp had not decreased to less than 98 of the initial value, while in prior art lamps this had decreased in the same period of time to 80 of the initial value.
