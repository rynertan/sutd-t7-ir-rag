# Liquid transfer device.

## Abstract
The liquid transfer device includes a hand held housing 12 having a plunger 18 mounted for sliding movement therein with a plurality of rods 20 on one end thereof. The plunger is located within a recess 16 in the housing with the rods normally protruding outside the recess when the plunger is located fully within the recess. A barrel assembly 52 is detachably connected to the housing and is provided with a plurality of through passages 60, 62 that are in equal number to the number of rods. An elastic diaphragm or membrane 24 is secured between the housing and the barrel assembly over the rods so that the membrane is stretched into the individual through passages by means of the rod so that the ends of the through passages adjacent the housing are sealed by the membrane. Upon depression of the plunger, the rods extend further into the through passages by stretching the elastic membrane and upon releasing the plunger the elastic membrane acts as a return spring for the plunger and rods to draw fluid into the passages from a suitable source for a subsequent deposit in individual test recepticles.
