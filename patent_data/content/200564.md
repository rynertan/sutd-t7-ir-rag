# Method for producing a hot fillable, collapse resistant polyester container without the need to utilize set process techniques and or non conventional container geometries.

## Abstract
A method of forming a thermal collapse resistance highly oriented polyester container for use in hot fill applications. In accordance with the method a polyester preform is reheated and then placed in a blow mold cavity whereat the preform is distended to match the blow mold cavity to form an intermediate article including a container having an oriented end unit receiving finish of a diameter materially greater than the diameter of the preform. The method is characterized in that in providing the preform the composition of the polyester, the draw ratio during distending of the preform and reheat conditions are all controlled to provide a container with a sidewall and finish density in the range of 1.250 to substantially but less than 1.370 grams cubic centimeter.
