# Method for stabilizing and selecting host cells containing recombinant DNA.

## Abstract
There is described a method for stabilizing and selecting host cells containing recombinant DNA which expresses a functional polypeptide and tne novel organisms and cloning vectors for the practice thereof. The method comprises a transforming the host cells with a recombinant DNA cloning vector which contains both a repressor gene and a gene which expresses a functional polypep tide and b lysogenizing the transformed host cells with a lysogenic organism containing a marker which is lethal or conditionally lethal in the host cells but which is repressed in the transformed host cells by the repressor gene contained in the recombinant DNA cloning vector subject to the limitation that the recombinant DNA cloning vector contains a replicon and a promoter which are not sensitive to the repressor, and subject to the further limitation, that when the transformed host cells are lysogenized with a lysogenic organism containing a gene which is conditionally lethal, the resulting host cells are cultured under restrictive conditions. A transformed host cell thus produced is also described.
