# A method for the preparation of silica aerogel and its use.

## Abstract
Silica aerogel in the form of a substantially crack free, preferably transparent block is described, together with a method for the preparaton of such aerogel and use thereof in solar panels. The preparation is effected by means of hydrolysis of a tetraalkoxysilane, preferably tetramethoxysilane, in an alcohol, preferably methanol, in the presence of a catalyst, preferably ammonia, for the formation of an alcogel which is aged for approximately 10 days and washed with alcohol for removing water. The alcogel is thereafter treated in an autoclave by means of a temperature increase to above the critical point of the alcohol, isothermic pressure drop by means of the release of alcohol vapor, and temperature drop. The temperature increase, the pressure drop and the temperature drop take place at such low mean rates that the aerogel does not crack. To this end, a total treatment time in the autoclave of at least 24 hours is required. After the autoclave treatment, a heat treatment at 500 to 750 C is possibly carried out for further improving the transparency of the aerogel.
