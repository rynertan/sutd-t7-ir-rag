## Description
MEASURING DEVICE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FLOWMETER This invention relates to a measuring device of an electromagnetic flowmeter which does not require a large amount of exciting power and can therefore operate with a relatively small amount of power cons0imp tion in spite of the fact that it has a relatively large diameter. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a measuring device of an electromagnetic flowmeter which can save the power consumption by effective utilization of the magnetic flux. The present invention takes notice of the mode of appearance of the induced voltage indicative of the flow rate of a fluid being measured by a measuring device of an electromagnetic flowmeter of internal excitation type and is featured by the fact that its magnetic poles are disposed within a predetermined circumference angle so as not to disturb the appearance of the induced output voltage, and the distance between the magnetic poles and an outer yoke disposed on the outer periphery of a flow rate measuring pipe is shortened so as to increase the permeance. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1A is a schematic cross sectional view showing the structure of a preferred embodiment of the measuring device of the electromagnetic flowmeter according to the present invention, the section being taken along the line IA IA in Fig. 1B Fig. 1B is a longitudinal sectional view taken along the line IB IB in Fig. lA Fig. 2 shows schematically the distribution of the magnetic field lines produced by the magnetic poles Fig. 3 shows schematically the distribution of the induced voltage in the embodiment shown in Fig. lA Fig. 4 is a schematic cross sectional view showing the structure of another preferred embodiment of the present invention which differs from that shown in Fig. 1A in both the cone support arrangement and the electrode arrangement Fig. 5 is a schematic enlarged view showing in detail the distribution of the magnetic potential and the lines of magnetic force produced by the magnetic poles and Fig. 6 is a schematic enlarged view showing in detail the distribution of the degree of voltage which is induced between electrodes in conjunction with magnetic flux and flowrate. Referring to Figs. IA and lB, a preferred embodiment of the measuring device includes a flow rate easuring pipe 1 though which a fluid whose flow rate is to be measured flows. This pipe 1 is made of a nonmagnetic material which is an electrical insulator in itself or which is provided with an electrical insulating coating on its inner wall. A fusiform or streamlined cone 2 having generally circular cross section is disposed inside of the pipe 1 and is fixedly supported in coaxial relation with the pipe 1 by two supporting members W. The cone 2 is made of a non magnetic material which is an electrical insulator in itself or which is provided with an electrical insulating coating on the surface making contact with the fluid.A pair of magnetic poles A and B are disposed opposite to each other in the diametrical direction of the cone 2 and extend along the outer peripery of the cone 2 over a suitable circumference angle of 2 a as shown in Fig. 1A. The magnetic poles A and B are coated with an electrical insulating coating on the surface making contact with the fluid. An inner yoke a core f having an exciting coil Q wound therearound for generating a magnetomotive force is disposed in the cone 2 between the magnetic poles A and B to be connected to the poles. A pair of electrodes G are provided on the outer periphery of the cone 2 at about the middle of the gap between the magnetic poles A and B. An outer yoke C made of a magnetic material and having a generally annular cross section is disposed around the pipe 1 in concentric relation with the pipe 1.The material of the inner yoke f generating the magnetomotive force may be any one of soft and hard ferromagnetic materials. When exciting current is supplied to the exciting coil Q, some of the lines of magnetic force flow out from the magnetic pole A to return to the magnetic pole B through the outer yoke C, and the remainder flow out from the magnetic pole A to return directly to the magnetic pole B, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 2. In the areas in which the magnetic poles A and B are opposed by the corresponding portions of the outer yokeC, the lines of magnetic force are directed mainly in the radial direction of the flow rate measuring pipe 1.In Fig. 2, the pipe 1 and the electrodes G are not shown to avoid confusion of the illustration. Voltages are generated in a direction orthogonal with respect to the flow rate direction which is orthogonal with respect to the drawing sheet surface and in a direction generally orthogonal with respect to the lines of magnetic force shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the mode of generation of the voltage which is described above.It will be seen from Fig. 3 that the induced voltage indicative of the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the pipe 1 appears along the magnetic equipotential lines shown in Fig. 2. The voltage thus generated is derived from the electrodes G and is applied to a flow rate calculating unit FC to appear as a flow rate signal. A flow rate calculating circuit as disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,227,408 may be used as this flow rate calculating unit FC. Fig. 4 shows another embodiment of the present invention which differs from the embodiment shown inFig. 1A in both the cone support arrangement and the electrode arrangement. Referring to Fig. 4, two supporting members W are aligned on the same diametrical line of a flow rate measuring pipe 1 for fixedly supporting a fusiform or streamlined cone 2 in the pipe 1. These supporting members W extend from the outer periphery of the cone 2 toward the flow rate measuring pipe 1 at about the middle of the gap between a pair of magnetic poles A and B and are fixed at the other end to the inner wall of the pipe 1. The pipe 1, cone 2 and supporting members W are made of a non magnetic material which is an electrical insulator in itself or which is provided with an electrical insulating coating on at least the surface making contact with the fluid. Similarly, the magnetic poles A and B are coated with an electrical insulating coating on at least the surface making contact with the fluid. A total of four electrodesG1, G2, G3 and G4 are disposed on the surfaces of the two supporting members W opposite to the inner circumference of the pipe 1 as shown. Induced voltages appearing across the electrodes G1, G2 and G3, 54 have the same level. As will be apparent from Fig. 3, the direction of the generated voltage changes most sharply at the disposed positions of the supporting members W, and an abrupt variation of the distribution of the velocity of the fluid in these areas results immediately in a corresponding abrupt variation of the output voltage.For the purpose of preventing such an abrupt variation of the output voltage, the supporting members W are disposed in the areas where the direction of the generated voltage changes most sharply, and the electrical leads provided in the cone 2 are passed through the interior of the supporting members W to be led to the exterior.It will be seen from the voltage distribution pattern shown in Fig. 3 that the direction of generation of the voltage changes sharply in the vicinity of the electrodesG. Actually, the electrodes G are disposed at the positions shown in Fig. 4, because the electrodes G are concealed by the supporting members W when the supporting members W are disposed at the positions shown in Fig. 3. The four electrodes G1, G2, G3 and are electrically insulated from one another. These electrodes may be connected in such a relation that the voltage across the electrodes G1 and G2 is in series with that across the electrodes G3 and G4 as shown inFig 4, or, in lieu of the series connection, such voltages are added in an external adder, thereby deriving an output signal voltage which is about two times as high as each voltage. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the calculated values of the magnetic potential and lines of magnetic force when the magnetic poles A and B extend over the circumference angle 2 a of 1600, and the outer diameter a of the cone 2 is selected to be 1 2 of the inner diameter b of the pipe 1. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the calculated value of the level of the generated voltage when the electrodes GA and GB are arranged as shown in Fig. 3 and extend over a circumference angle 2 ya of 60 , and the magnetic circuit has a shape as shown in Fig. 5.The arrangement shown in Fig. 6 is especially advantageous for the electromagnetic flowmeter of the residual magnetism type. It will be understood from the foregoing description that, in the measuring device according to the present invention, the magnetomotive force generating means is provided in the cone disposed inside of the flow rate measuring pipe to provide a magnetic circuit of the so called internal excitation type. The present invention is therefore advantageous in that the amount of leakage flux can be minimized, and the weight of the magnetic circuit can be reduced. Further, according to the present invention, the gap of the magnetic path, that is, the radial distance between the magnetic pole A or B and the outer yoke C can be shortened, hence, the diameter of the cone 2 or the diameter of the outer peripheral portion of the cone 2 carrying the magnetic poles A and B can be selected to be close to the inner diameter of the pipe 1. The present invention is therefore further advantageous in that the permeance of the gap can be increased for more effective utilization of the magnetic flux thereby correspondingly reducing the power consumption.
