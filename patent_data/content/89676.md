## Description
Novel DNA and Use Thereof This invention relates to a DNA containing a base sequence coding for the human immune interferon polypeptide, a host transformed therewith, and a method of producing human immune interferon using said host, and various interferon products. Background Art Interferons hereinafter sometimes abbreviated to IFs are proteins produced by cells of higher animals in response to the stimulation of a virus, nucleic acid, etc., and have antiviral, antitumor and other activities. At present it is known that human IFs include three types, namely alpha, beta and gamma types, which are different in properties. The alpha and beta types are induced by a virus or nucleic acid and the gamma type is usually induced by mitogens. Comparatively, the study of alpha type IF hereinafter referred to an IF a and beta type IF hereinafter referred to as IF ss has considerably advanced, and the mechanisms of their production have been elucidated to a considerable extent. Furthermore, advances in gene manipulation techniques have made it possible to produceIF a and IF ssl by growing Escherichia coli or to produce IF al by growing a yeast said IFs are thus obtainable in large amounts as physiologically active proteins See D. V.Goeddel et al., Nature, 287, 411 1980 E. Yelverton et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 731 1981 D. V. Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 8, 4057 1980 R. Hitzeman et al.,Nature, 293, 717 1981 . Furthermore, attempts have been made to produce such IFs in amounts sufficiently large to enable commercial clinical use thereof. Gamma type IF hereinafter sometimes referred to as 1,IF y is also called immune interferon hereinafter sometimes referred to as IFI because it is produced by immunocompetent cells under those conditions which may induce blast formation of lymphocytes or production of lymphokine. IFI has greater antiproliferative and antitumor activities than IF a and IF B, and therefore is more promising from the viewpoint of clinical application.However, no efficient production system therefor has been established because fresh lymphocytes are necessary.Furthermore, the possibility has been suggested that different cell species produce IFIs of different molecular species in different experimental systems. On the other hand, since IFs are highly speciesspecific, human derived IFs must be used in application to humans. However, mass production of human immune interferon has been so difficult that its application in clinical practice has thus far been impossible. Development of a technique capable of producing large amounts of highly pure human IFI in a simple manner and at low cost has been eagerly waited for. Making use of gene manipulation techniques, the present inventors have engaged in developing a technique which enables production n f the desired IFI by cloning the human IFI gene, incorporating the resulting recombinantDNA molecule into a host, thereby causing expression of the human IFI gene in said host and recovering the humanIFI. Disclosure of the Invention This invention provides a DNA containing a base sequence coding for the human immune interferon polypeptide, a host transformed with said DNA, a method of producing human immune interferon or a polypeptide equivalent thereto, which method comprises growing a host transformed. with saidDNA, and novel interferon products. Thus, the DNA provided by the present invention is aDNA having the base sequence represented by the formula 1 TGT TAC TGC CAG GAC CCA TAT GTA AAA GAA TGT GCA GAA AAC CTT AAG AAA TAT TTT AAT GCA GGT CAT TCA GAT GTA GCG GAT AAT GGA ACT CTT TTC TTA GGC ATT TTG AAG AAT TGG AAA GAG GAG AGT GAC AGA AAA ATA ATG CAG AGC CAA ATT GTC TCC TTT TAC TTC AAA CTT TTT AAA AAC TTT AAA GAT GAC CAG AGC ATC CAA AAG AGT GTG GAG ACC ATC AAG GAA GAC ATG AAT GTC AAG TTT TTC AAT AGC AAC AAA AAG AAA CGA GAT GAC TTC GAA AAG CTG ACT AAT TAT TCG GTA ACT GAC TTG AAT GTC CAA CGC AAA GCA ATA CAT GAA CTC ATC CAA GTG ATG GCT GAA CTG TCG CCA GCA GCT AAA ACA GGG 140 AAG CGA AAA AGG AGT CAG ATG CTG TTT CGA GGT CGA 146 AGA GCA TCC CAG X 3 I wherein X is TAA, TGA or TAG. The DNA of formula I codes for the polypeptide of the formula N Cys Tyr Cys Gln Asp Pro Tyr Val Lys Glu Ala Glu Asn Leu Lys Lys Tyr Phe Asn Ala Gly His Ser Asp Val Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Leu Phe Leu Gly Ile Leu Lys Asn Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys Ile Met Gln Ser Gln Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Phe Lys Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys Ser Val Glu Thr Ile Lys Glu Asp Met Asn Val Lys Phe Phe Asn Ser Asn Lys Lys Lys Arg Asp Asp Phe Glu Lys Leu Thr Asn Tyr Ser Val Thr Asp Leu Asn Val Gln Arg Lys Ala Ile His Glu Leu Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala Ala Lys Thr Gly Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Arig Arg Ala Ser Gln C 11 or a polypeptide equivalent thereto in immunological or biological activities. The above DNA I may have at the 5 end thereof 5 ATG AAA TAT ACA AGT TAT ATC TTG GCT TTT CAG CTC TGC ATCGTT TTG GGT TCT CTT GGC 3 III orATG IV . When the DNA I has the DNA of formula III at the 5 end, it codes not only for the polypeptide II but also for the polypeptide having Met Lys Tyr Thr Ser TyrIle Leu Ala Phe Gln Leu Cys Ile Val Leu Gly Ser Leu Gly added to the N terminus or a polypeptide equivalent thereto in activities. When the DNA I has the DNA of formula IV at the 5 end, it codes not only for the polypeptide II but also for the polypeptide having Met added to theN terminus or a polypeptide equivalent thereto in activities. The DNA I is preferably connected at the site of downstream from a promoter. Suitable promoters therefor include the tryptophan trp promoter, the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter or other known promoters such as the lactose lac promoter, and the protein chain elongation factor Tu tufB promoter. Preferable among them are the trp promoter and the PL promoter. The P11 promoter is a very strong promoter that can be efficiently and conveniently controlled by the X cI repressor. The gene encoding the repressor carries a mutation, cIts2 or cIts857, which renders the repressor temperature sensitive. At 300 the repressor functions normally, and from about 370C to about 420C it is inactivated. Thus the PL promoter is repressed turned off at 300C and derepressed turned on at 420C. This feature is desirable herein in that the gene product of interest may be toxic to the cell or that if present in large quantity it would be detrimental to cell growth. The ability to control the PL promoter allows one to grow the culture at about 300C to about 360C without expressing the gene product and at an optimum time, shift the temperature from about 370C to about 420C to produce the desired gene product. In general formula I , X, which is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide, is preferably TAA. The symbols as used herein in the specification, drawings and claims have the meanings shown in Table 1.

The human peripheral blood lymphocytes to be used in the practice of the invention may be either uninduced cells or induced cells. The IFI inducer to be used in practicing the invention may be any agent capable of inducing human lymphocytic cells to produce IFI and includes, among others, phytohemaggutinin PHA , Concanavalin A ConA , staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA , neuraminidase galactose oxidase NAGO , 12 0 tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA and combinations thereof. Induction of IFI can be effected by growing the cells in a per se known medium, such as RPMI 1640 or MEM medium, preferably in RPMI 1640 medium containing foetal bovine serum. The cultivation is carried out at a temperature of 35 390C, desirably 36 380, for 12 72 hours, desirably 22 26 hours. The cells are collected by a per se known method and, after addition, for example, of guanidine thiocyanide, bentonite, heparin, polyvinyl sulfate, aurintricarboxylic acid, vanadium complex, diethyl pyrocarbonate DPC or sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS as the RNase inhibitor, lysed for RNA extraction by adding sodium liiuroylsarcosinate, Tween 80 or Nonidet P 40, for example.After repeated extraction as necessary by adding phenol, phenol chloroform or the like to the RNA containing extract, RNAs are collected by precipitation with ethanol.Since many of mRNAs present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells are known to contain a poly A sequence at the 3 end, poly A RNAs are collected with the use of oligo dT cellulose, poly U sepharose or the like and fractionated by the sucrose density gradient centrifugation method. Aliquots of each fraction obtained are injected into oocytes of Xenopas laevis a frog species for translation. J. B. Gurdon, et al., Nature, 233, 177 1971 . The produced protein is assayed for antiviral activity. In this manner, the mRNA for IFI can be obtained.The mRNA can also be purified by formamide polyacrylamide gel electrohoresis or by agarose gel electrophoresis or by agarose gel electrophoresis using glyoxal. Using the thus obtained mRNA as the template, the single stranded complementary DNA cDNA chain is synthesized by a per se known method, for instance, with the use of a reverse transcriptase. The cDAN is then converted to the double stranded DNA T. Maniatis et al.,Cell, 8, 163 1976 . This DNA is inserted, for example, into the plasmid pBR322, e.g., at the PstI or SphI restriction endonuclease cleavage site, for example by the dG dC or dA dT homopolymer tailing method described in T. S. Nelson Methods in Enzymology, 68, 41 1979 , Academic Press Inc.,New York . The recombinant plasmid is then introduced, for example, into Escherichia coli X1776, by transformation.The transformants can be selected as the tetracycline resistant or ampicillin resistant colonies. Separately, a probe oligonucleotide having a base sequence supposedly corresponding to at least part of the amino acid sequence of the IFI polypeptide is synthesized chemically and labeled with 32p. Using the labeled oligonucleotide as the probe, the desired clones are secondarily screened out from among the already obtained tetracycline or ampicillin resistant transformants, for example by then per se known colony hybridization method M. Grunstein and D. S. Hogness,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 3961 1975 . For confirming the presence of the IFI gene, the base sequence of the clones showing the positive colony hydridization result is determined, for example, by theMaxam Gilbert method A. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 560 1977 or the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method using phageM13 J. Messing et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 309 1981 .The whole or part of the IFI gene may also be excised from the clones obtained and then connected downstream from an adequate promoter and SD Shine Delgarno sequence, for introduction into an adequate host. The promoter includes the above mentioned promotors and the host includes such bacteria as Es cherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, and other microorganisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Preferred as the host is Escherichia coli, such as E. coli strains 294 or W3110, especially E. coli 294. Escherichia coli 294 is a known bacterial strain K. Backman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 73, 4174 1976 and is also on deposit in the Institute forFermentation, Osaka Deposit No. IFO 14171 . The transformation of a host with the DNA of the invention is carried out, for example, by the known method of S. N. Cohen, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 69, 2110 1972 .The compound of the formula Y Cys Tyr Cys Gln Asp Pro Tyr Val Lys Glu Ala Glu Asn Leu Lys Lys Tyr Phe Asn Ala Gly His Ser Asp Val Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Leu Phe Leu Gly Ile Leu Lys Asn Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys Ile Met Gln Ser Gln Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Phe Lys Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys Ser Val Glu Thr Ile Lys Glu Asp Met Asn Val Lys Phe Phe Asn Ser Asn Lys Lys Lys Arg Asp Asp Phe Glu Lys Leu Thr Asn Tyr Ser Val Thr Asp Leu Asn Val Gln Arg Lys Ala Ile His Glu Leu Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala Ala Lys Thr Gly Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Arg Arg Ala Ser Gln 11 wherein Y is a hydrogen, b Met or c Met Lys Tyr Thr Ser Tyr Ile Ala Phe Gln Leu Cys Ile Val Leu Gly Ser LeuGly can be produced, for example, by growing thus obtained host, accumulating compound II in the culture broth and recovering the same. The host is grown in a per se known medium. The medium is, for example, M9 medium containing glucose and casamino acids J. Miller, Experiments inMolecular Genetics, 431 433, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,New York, 1972 . For efficient working of the promoter, a derepressing agent such as 8 indolylacrylic acid may be added as necessary. The incubation is carried out generally at 15 439C for 3 24 hours, if necessary with aeration and or stirring. When a transformant having a X cI repressor and an expression vector containing the PL promoter is used, lower temperatures are used for incubation, i.e., approximately 300 to about 360C and the X cI repressor may advantageously be inactivated under incubation at about 370 to 420C. After the incubation, the cells are collected by a known method and, after suspending in a buffer solution, for instance, lysed, for example, by ultrasonic treatment, by lysozyme, and or freezing and thawing, or other methods e.g., Gunsalus, Extraction of Enzymes from Microorganisms ,Methods in Enzymology I 51 1955 . The supernatant is recovered by centrifugation. The isolation of human IFI from said supernatant may be carried out by commonly known methods for protein purification. The IFI, or polypeptide equivalent thereto in immunological or biological activities, as produced in accordance with the invention has immunological and biological activities equivalent to those of the IFI species produced by previously known methods and can be used in the same manner and for the same purposes as the known IFI species. IFI has exhibited antiviral, antitumor, growth inhibition and immunosuppression activity. The compound can be mixed with a sterile pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sterile water, human serum albumin, HSA , normal saline solution, or other carriers well known in the art, and administered orally or topically. Daily dosages for intravenous treatment range from about 10 million units to about 100 million units per day for normal adults, preferably about 50 to 60 million units per day. The pharmaceutical product may contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, such as salts, diluents, adjuvants, other carriers, buffers, binders, surface active agents, preservatives, etc.Preparations for parenteral use could be provided as an ampoule of a sterile solution or suspension of the product with water or another pharmaceutically acceptable liquid as the carrier therefore, or an ampoule of sterile powder preferably obtained by lyophilization of a solution ofIFI for dilution withpharmaceutically acceptable liquid. Moreover, the product of the present invention may contain other pharmaceutically active components which are suitably administerable with IFI, including for example lymphocyte or fibroblast interferon, in amounts ranging from about 1 99 , based on the amount of IFI.

This series of reactions gave about 300 ng of a double stranded deoxycytidine chain containing DNA. v Cleavage of Escherichia coli plasmid and addition of dG tails Separately, 10 pg of Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322DNA was treated with restriction enzyme PstI in 50 pl of a reaction mixture containing 10 pg pBR322 DNA, 50 mMNaCl, 6 mM MgC12, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 100 Ug ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 units PstI in 6 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.4 , at 370C for three hours, for cleavage at the one PstI recognition site present in the pBR322 DNA.The reaction mixture was then deproteinized with phenol and the DNA was further treated with terminal transferase in 50 pl of a reaction mixture containing 10 pg DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacolylate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoCl2, 0.15 mM dGTP, and 30 units terminal transferase in 0.3 MTris base pH 7.6 at 370C for 3 minutes for addition of about 8 deoxyguanosine residues at each 3 end of the above plasmid pBR322 DNA. vi Annealing of cDNA and transformation of Escherichia coli The annealing was effected by heating 0.1 pg of the thus obtained dC tailed synthetic double stranded DNA and 0.5 pg of the above dG tailed plasmid pBR322 in a solution containing 0.1 M NaC1, 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.6 and 1 mM EDTA at 650C for 2 minutes and then at 450C for 2 hours, followed by gradual cooling. The transformation of Escherichia coli X1776 was performed by the method ofEnea et al. J. Mol. Biol., 96, 495 1975 . vii Isolation of plasmid containing cDNA About 8500 tetracycline resistant colonies were thus isolated, and the DNA of each colony was fixed to a nitrocellulose filter M. Grunstein and D. S. Hogness,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72 3961 1975 J. Separately, based on the amino acid sequence of IFI as reported by D. V. Goeddel et al. Nature, 295, 503 A A 1982 , two base sequences 5 TCCTGGCAGTAGC 3 and 5 ACATTCATATCcTTCcTT 3 , presumably corresponding to amino acids Nos. 1 5 Cys.Tyr.Cys.Gln.Asp and amino acids Nos.77 82 lays.Gln.Asp.Met.Asn.Val of said IFI sequence, respectively, were chemically synthesized by the triester method described in R. Crea et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. SciUSA, 75, 5765 1978 . These oligonucleotides were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 p1 of a reaction mixture 0.2 pg oligonucleotide, 10 mM MgC12, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 50 Ci gamma êP ATP, and 3 units T4 poly nucleotide kinase in 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.0 , at 370C for an hour. These oligonucleotides thus labeled with êP at the 5 end were used as probes and annealed with theDNA on the above mentioned nitrocellulose filter by the method of Lawn et al Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 6103 1981 .Four colonies reactive to the above two oligonucleotide probes were isolated using autoradiography. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from the bacterial cells of each of these colonies by the method of Birnboim andDoly Nucleic Acids Res. 7, 1513 1979 . The inserts in the plasmid DNAs were excised with the PstI restriction enzyme. From among the isolated plasmids, the one containing the longest cDNA insert was chosen and named pHIT3709. The restriction enzyme map of this plasmid is shown in Fig. 1. The primary structure base sequence of the cDNA sequence inserted in the pHIT3709 plasmid was then determined by the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method and by the Maxam Gilbert method.Said primary structure was as shown in Fig. 2. This primary structure is in agreement with that ofIFI cDNA as reported by Gray et al. Nature, 295, 503 508 1982 except that the former differs from the latter in one codon namely the former s codon for the No. 140 amino acid is CGA, while the latter s is CAA for Gln.The protein determined by this base sequence presumably consists of 166 amino acids whose synthesis is initiated from the No. 30 nucleotide, namely the ATG codon, which is the signal for the start of protein synthesis. The first 20 amino acids probably constitute a signal peptide.The amino acid sequence, too, is different from the IFI reported by Gray et al. with regard to the No. 140 amino acid Arg in place of Gln . From the above mentioned primary structure, it is clear that this plasmid has the entire coding region for the IFI protein. This fact permits making hosts such asEscherichia coli produce immune interferon by transfering the DNA sequence inserted in this plasmid to another expression plasmid. Example 2 The insert in the pHIT3709 plasmid as obtained inExample 1 was excised from the No. 100 nucleotide thereof with the BstNI restriction enzyme cf. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and, after filling in of the sticky ends with DNA polymerase I large fragment also called Klenow s DNA polymerase I , ligated, with the use of T4 DNA ligase, with the oligonucleotide adapter CGATAATGTGTTACTGCC TATTACACAATGACGG which was chemically synthesized by the above mentioned triester method and contains the protein synthesis start codon ATG. A second plasmid ptrp601 containing pBR322 and the tryptophan promoter portion of Escherichia coli i.e., the promoter and operator containing DNA fragment , containing 276 base pairs, was constructed as the expression plasmid, using the method of G. N. Bennett et al. J. Mol. Biol. 121, 113 1978 3. This plasmid ptrp601 was cut with the ClaI restriction enzyme, and the IFI gene with the above mentioned adapter ligated thereto was inserted into the plasmid vector downstream from the tryptophan promoter, using T4DNA ligase. An IFI expression plasmid pHIT.trp30l was thus constructed Fig. 3 . A bacterial strain containing this plasmid pHIT.trp301 was obtained by transforming Escherichia coli 294 with that plasmid by the method of Cohen et al. supra. Example 3 The bacterial strain containing the IFI expression plasmid as obtained in Example 2 is grown in M9 medium containing 0.5 glucose and 0.5 casamino acids at 370C for 6 hours. The cells are then collected and suspended in 0.15 M NaC1 solution in 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and lysed by ultrasonic treatment. Centrifugation gives a supernatant. The interferon activity of this supernatant can be measured by assay on WISH cells in accordance with the method mentioned in Example l i supra, and described by W. E. Steward, supra. Example 4 The bacterial strain containing the IFI expression plasmid, pHIT.trp30l, as obtained in Example 2 was grown in M9 medium containing 0.5 glucose and 0.52 casamino acids at 370C for 6 hours under shaking. Indole acrylic acid was added to a final concentration of 20 pg ml and incubation was further continued at 370C for 3 hours under shaking. A 10 ml sample was taken, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mMTris pH 7.4 containing 10 percent sucrose, and the suspension was quick frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath.Then, the cells were thawed at 200C, and transferred to an ice bath. To the cell suspension NaCl was added to a concentration of 100 mM, EDTA to 10 mM, spermidine to 20 mM, and lysozyme to 200 pg ml. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 minutes, then incubated at 370C for 2 minutes.Lysis was apparent by the increase in viscosity of the suspension. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was assayed for IFI anti viral activity onWISH cells. This experiment resulted in a yield of 1280 units of IFI activity per ml of cell extract. The following illustrative embodiments illustrate the expression of IFI utilizing the APL promoter system together with the IFI coding DNA segment of the present invention. Example 5 In order to isolate a 350 base pair bp fragment containing the X P11 promoter, 250 pg of X cI857 Sam7DNA Miles Laboratories was digested with restriction endonucleases BamHl and Bgl II, and the products were separated on agarose gel by electrophoresis. A 1200 bp fragment containing the P11 promoter was isolated from the gel see Fig. 4 . This 1200 bp fragment was then digested completely with HpaI and partially digested with Hinf I and a 350 bp fragment was isolated from a 5 polyacrylamide gel.Digestion with HpaI eliminated 2 Hinf I partial fragments of about 350 bp that would have otherwise contaminated the desired fragment. This 350 bp fragment contains the PL promoter and the OL operator sites OL1 OL2, OL3 to which theX cI repressor binds. The Hinf I site, which occurs between the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence of the X N gene and the initiating codon for the N gene see Fig. 4 , allows for the construction of hybrid ribosome binding sites for the purpose of expressing foreign genes inE. coli. This Hinfl site may also be converted to anEcoRl site. The 350 bp Bgl II HinfI fragment was cloned into plasmid pRCl which had been digested with EcoRl and Bgl II.pRCl is a derivative of pBR322 that contains a Bgl II site adjacent to the EcoRl site see Fig. 5 . Figure 5 shows the sequences of the joining terminal and indicates how the EcoRl terminus of the vector can join to the Hinf I terminus of the fragment, thus reconstituting theEcoRl site. The circles A in Figure 5 was filled in in vivo. The resulting recombinant plasmid was designated pRC14. Using the same techniques, a number of other expression vectors using the P11 promoter were also constructed Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9 . pRC15 contains, in addition to the 350 bp Bgl II Hinf I fragment described above, a 55 base pair fragment Hinf E Mboil that contains the SD sequence of the A int gene see Figs. 6 and 7 . pRC21 and pRC22 are analogous to pRC14 and pRC15, respectively.The principle difference between these plasmids is the orientation of the inserted P11 containing fragment, and thus the direction of transcription see Fig. 8 . pRC23 was constructed by ligating synthetic oligonucleotides containing a consensus RBS Scherer, et al., NucleicAcids Research, 8, 3895 1980 to a 250 bp Bgl II HaeIII fragment containing the P11 promoter, and inserting the ligation product into pRC2 as shown in Figure 9. PL expression vectors were also constructed containing the Immune Interferon IFI gene from plasmid pHIT3709, from Example 1, supra, as shown in the following examples. Example 6 A 900 bp BstNl fragment was isolated from pHIT3709 which contains 430 bp of coding sequence for IFI and 470 bp of the 3 noncoding region. Not present on this fragment are the sequences for the signal portion ofIFI and the codons for the first 3 amino acids of the presumed mature protein. To restore the three missing codons and to provide an initiating Met codon, synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared and ligated to the 900 bp fragment see Fig. 10 . The synthetic segment converted both of the BstNl termini. to EcoRl termini. The resulting fragment was cloned into vector pRC22 which had been restricted with EcoRl. Orientation of the insert was determined by restriction analysis with Bgl I which cuts within the 3 noncoding region. The pRC22 vector containing the IFI gene denoted pRC22 IFI 900 was sequenced across the promoter gene junction to assure that all ligation steps occurred as expected. See Fig. 10 . The test for expression of the IFI gene, strain RRI pRK248cIts, pRC22 IFI 900 was grown in M9 glucose media at 300C to 3 4 x 108 cells ml, then induced at 420C for one hour. Prior to induction, additional glucose and casamino acids were added to 1.0 and 0.5 percent, respectively. A 10 ml sample was taken, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 , 10 percent sucrose, and the suspension was quick frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath.The cells were thawed at 200C, then transferred to an ice bath. NaCl was added to 100 mM, EDTA to 10 mM, spermidine to 20 mM, and lysozyme to 200 pg ml. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 minutes, then incubated at 370C for 2 minutes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was assayed for IFI antiviral activity on WISH cells. This initial experiment resulted in a yield of 1280 units of IFI activity per ml of cell extract. In order to determine the kinetics of induction, the above procedure was repeated. One sample was kept at 300C as a control, and other samples were taken after induction at 420C for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes.The samples were processed as described above. The results, shown in Table 2, indicate that at 300C no activity is produced and that following induction at 420C the amount of activity detected reaches a maximum at around 90 minutes, then gradually declines.

The resulting construction, pRC23 IFI 900, contained a RBS significantly different from that in pRC22 IFI compare Figs. 10 and 11 .To test for expression of the IFI gene, strain RRI pRK248cIts, prC23 IFI 900 was grown in M9 glucose media at 300C to 3 4 x 108 cells ml, then induced at 420C for one hour.Prior to induction, additional glucose and casamino acids were added to 1.0 and 0.5 percent, respectively. A 10 ml sample was taken, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 , 10 percent sucrose, and the suspension was quick frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath. The cells were thawed at 200C, then transferred to an ice bath. NaCl was added to 100 mM,EDTA to 10 mM, spermidine to 20 mM, and lysozyme to 1200 pg ml. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 minutes, then incubated at 370C for 2 minutes. Cells debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was assayed to IFI anti viral activity on WISH cells. pRC23 IFI when used to transform E. coli strain RR1, produced about four times more activity than pRC22 IFI, as shown in Table 3.

The resulting molecules were then treated with Pol I Klenow to fill in the EcoRl termini. The blunt ends were ligated together with T4 DNA ligase and the DNA was used to transform RRI pRK248cIts . Transformants were screened for the loss of the EcoRl site at the beginning of the IFI gene and two positives were obtained. One of these, denoted pRC231 IFI 900, was used to transform E.coli strain RR1 to express IFI. To test for expression of the IFI gene, this strain RRI PpRK248cIts, pRC231 IFI 900 was was grown in M9 glucose media at 30 C to 3 4 X 10 cells ml, then induced at 42C for one hour. Prior to induction, additional glucose and casamino acids were added to 1.0 and 0.5 percent, respectively. A 10 ml sample was taken, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 , 10 percent sucrose, and the suspension was quick frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath.The cells were thawed at 200C, then transferred to an ice bath. NaCl was added to 100 mM, EDTA to 10 mM, Spermidine to 20 mM, and lysozyme to 200 pg ml. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 minutes, then incubated at 370C for 2 minutes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was assayed for IFI anti viral activity on WISH cells. The results are shown in Table 3. The modification of pRC23 IFI described was designed to extend the linker region from 6 to 10 bp. In the case of IFI, a distance of 6 bp appears to be better 10 bp for expression of IFI. Example 9 Human immune interferon obtained in accordance with the present invention may be purified by a procedure such as the following All steps are preferably carried out at low temperature, preferably below room temperature, and more preferably at about 40C. The IFI containing material, e.g. the supernatant fluid of Example 4, can be sequentially filtered through a 3 micron and then an 0.22 micron Nalgene filter. The next purification step utilizes a high performance weak cation exchange liquid chromatography column. CM 200 resin, 10 m Separation Industries is packed into a 25 cm X 0.46 cm I.D. column, and prepared for use by cleaning with 2 M KC1 and re equilibrating with 24 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, or with distilled, deionized water which should be used throughout this procedure the filtrate from the 0.22 microfilter is diluted with an equal volume of water and pumped at 1.5 ml min. onto the CM column. The column is then washed with 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, until protein in the column effluent is down to background levels, as determined by automatic monitoring of the column with fluorescamine. The column is then eluted at 0.5 ml min with a gradient of increasing KC1 0 to 1 M in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The active fractions from the CM column are pooled and concentrated on a prewashed CF 25 filter cone AmiconCorp. . The concentrated solution 0.5 ml or less is then injected into a TSK 250 silica gel permeation column 30 x 0.75 cm Bio Rad Laboratories , which has been preequilibrated, and eluted with 0.3 M KC1, 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 24 ml hr. Fractions are collected at 1 minute intervals. Interferon activity will correspond to a peak of protein. Homogeneous immune interferon may be obtained in one or more fractions at this stage, depending on the starting material and the efficiency of the earlier steps. If necessary, impure fractions can be reconcentrated and re chromatographed on the TSK or CM column to achieve homogeneity. The present invention has made it possible to produce human immune interferon or an equivalent thereto in an economical manner. Said interferon is useful as an antiviral or antitumor agent.
