## Abstract
Method for thermally toughening glass sheets and glass sheets obtained by this method, in particular to be used as motor vehicle side or rear windows. A method of thermally toughening glass sheets for use as motor vehicle side or rear windows so that the glass sheets produced conform to regulations specifying fracture requirements. The glass sheets are advanced through a quenching station for gas quenching. The glass is subjected to at least one localised gas flow which is pulsed at a repetition frequency related to the speed or advance of the glass sheet through the quenching statement. The method induces in the glass sheet a distribution or regions of more highly toughened glass interspersed with regions of lesser toughened glass.
