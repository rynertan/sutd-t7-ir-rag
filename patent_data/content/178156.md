# Method of drawing a desired pattern on a target through exposure thereof with an electron beam.

## Abstract
In a method of drawing a desired pattern on a target through exposure thereof with an electron beam, a pattern area 51, 52 on the target surface is defined by first pixels 53 ar ranged in rows and columns and is exposed by a first electron beam. A background area 56 other than the pattern area on the target surface is also defined by secondary pixels 58 which are arranged in rows and columns, and is exposed by a secondary electron beam to compensate for the proximity ef fect. The secondary pixels 58 have a size larger than that of the first pixels 53 and the second electron beam forms on the target surface a second beam spot 59 which is larger than the first beam spot 54 formed on the target surface by the first electron beam so that the background area is exposed in a re duced period of time.
