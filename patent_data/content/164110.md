# Coin discrimination apparatus.

## Abstract
A coin discrimination apparatus has detecting means for detecting as an electrical signal a physical characteristic of a coin an analog to digital converter for converting an output of the detecting means to a digital signal and a memory device for receiving as an address signal the digital signal generated from the analog to digital converter and for storing a binary signal of a plurality of bits for discriminating the physical characteristic in bit positions corresponding to a denomination of the coin at each address for each of the physical characteristics. The memory device is accessed by the digital signal from the analog to digital converter as a read signal and allows readout of the accessed content as a signal representing authenticity of the coin.
