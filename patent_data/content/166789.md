# FORMED ARTICLE OF CALCIUM SILICATE AND METHOD OF THE PREPARATION THEREOF.

## Abstract
A formed article of calcium silicate comprising a number of mutually combined secondary particles of calcium silicate crystal, voids scattered among said secondary particles, and inactive inorganic substances selected from among carbo naceous substances, carbides, nitrides, silicides and metal oxides, said inorganic substances being physically united with said secondary particles, wherein I the content of said inactive substances is 21 to 70 by weight of the formed article, and II an amorphous silicic substance is incorpo rated with said inactive substances. A method of preparing a formed article of calcium silicate by subjecting a slurry of starting materials composed of silicic acid, lime and water to hydrothermal synthesis by stirring said slurry under heat and pressure to prepare an aqueous of slurry of secondary particles of calcium silicate crystal, forming said slurry and dry the formed slurry, which comprises the steps of adding said inactive inorganic substance to said slurry of the starting materials and physically uniting said inorganic substances with said secondary particles via hydrothermal synthesis, wherein I the amount of the added inactive substances is 21 to 70 by weight of the formed article, and II an amorphous silic substance is incorporated with said aqueous slurry of secondary particles of calcium silicate crystal.
