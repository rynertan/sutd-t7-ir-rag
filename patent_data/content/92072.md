# Emergency seal.

## Abstract
A safety seal for a shaft 14 passing through a housing. The seal is normally maintained in a non sealing relation ship to the shaft, but may be actuated during emergency conditions by levers. The seal includes an annular, split housing 20a, 20b having a radially extending compartment 16 which contains at least two seal members 34, 34 which are held together by a bias to define a seal annulus. The seal members 34, 34 are radially contracted into sealing engagement and expanded to a non sealing position by cams 44 or levers 60 mounted in the seal members.
