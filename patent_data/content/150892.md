## Description
This invention relates to a class of novel compounds comprising substituted alkylidene imidazole derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to the use of such compounds and compositions as agents for selectively inhibiting the action of the enzyme thromboxane synthetase. Certain compounds and compositions of the present invention may be particularly useful in treating diseases which involve platelet dysfunction or platelet hyperactivity, such as cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, angina, peripheral vascular disease and myocardial infarction. The discovery of thromboxane A₂ TxA₂ and prostacyclin PGI₂ , has increased the understanding of vascular haemostasis. Platelets transform arachidonic acid initially into prostaglandin endoperoxides, via an enzyme, cyclooxygenase, and subsequently into TxA₂, by an enzyme, thromboxane synthetase. TxA₂ is a potent vasoconstrictor and proaggregatory substance, and as such, its actions are directly opposed to PGI₂. When platelets are stimulated by thrombin, collagen, ADP and adrenaline, the platelets release and metabolise endogenous arachidonic acid to TxA₂. This endogenous TxA₂ appears to play an essential role in a second irreversible phase of ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation. In addition to aggregating platelets, TxA₂ is a potent vasoconstrictor and thus the continuous generation of TxA₂ by platelets adhering to damaged arterial walls results in localised vasoconstriction of the arteries. PGI₂ is a powerful vasodilator and potent anti aggregatory agent, effective in preventing platelets from aggregating and in reversing platelet aggregation by dissipating platelet clumps. PGI₂ is synthesised from prostaglandin endoperoxides by an enzyme, prostacyclin synthetase, located in the endothelial layer of blood vessels and in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Normal morphological interaction between platelets and vessel walls provides for the transfer of prostaglandin endoperoxides from platelets to endothelial cells thereby increasing PGI₂ production and preventing platelet deposition on vessel walls. Thus when endothelial prostacyclin synthetase is inactivated, for example, by lipid peroxides, or when endothelium becomes detached exposing the underlying connective tissues i.e., collagen to platelets, or when polymerising fibrin prevents the interaction between platelets and endothelial cells, arterial thrombosis may develop. Thus, TxA₂ has been implicated as a causative agent in thrombus formation, myocardial infarction, stroke, variant angina and peripheral vascular disease. Effective A PGI₂ TxA₂ imbalance is also believed to be a contributory factor in migraine. The migraine headache is associated with a pre headache reduction of cerebral blood flow followed by dilatation in both the intra and extra cerebral vascular areas during the headache phase. Prior to the headache, blood levels of 5 hydroxytryptamine are elevated, suggesting the occurrence of Platelets obtained from some patients with diabetes mellitus are hyperactive, exhibiting enhanced Aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. indomethacin, sulphinpyrazone inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and therefore inhibit PGI₂ production as well as TxA₂ production. A drug which specifically inhibits TxA₂ formation while leaving PGI₂ biosynthesis unimpaired, should therefore display advantages in the treatment of conditions involving an imbalance of PGI₂ TxA₂ over the currently available cyclooxygenase inhibitors. U.S. Patent No. 4,243,671 describes the use of 1 3 phenyl 2 propenyl 1H imidazole and its hydrochloride salt as an inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase and as an inhibitor of arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation and bronchoconstriction.

Various compounds of the present invention were evaluated utilizing an Human venous blood was collected from healthy male donors, who had denied any medication during the previous 14 days. Nine volumes of blood were mixed with one volume of 3.24 trisodium citrate. The citrated blood was centrifuged at 160 g for 10 mins. at 22 C to obtain platelet rich plasma prp . The platelets were then counted on a Coulter counter, and the platelet count was adjusted to 200,000 per µl with plasma. The prp was then dispensed as aliquots into micro Eppendorf tubes, maintained at 37 c in a dry bath. The compound to be evaluated was dissolved either in saline, ethanol, or dimethylsulphoxide, and added in duplicate to the prp aliquots to produce a final concentration in the range of 0.1 30 µg ml. When ethanol or dimethylsulphoxide was used to dissolve the compound, triplicate controls containing the same percentage of ethanol or dimethyl sulphoxide as the test compound was made. The final concentration of organic solvent was never greater than 0.1 , which has been determined to have no effect on TxB₂ generation. Following a 10 min. incubation with test compounds or controls, collagen was added to the tubes containing the test compounds to produce a final concentration of 20 µg ml. The tubes were then whirly mixed for 15 seconds and replaced in the dry bath for a further 10 minutes. Saline was added to the tubes containing the controls, in lieu of collagen. The reaction was then stopped by rapid centrifugation 15000 g for 3 mins . The plasma was removed and frozen at 29 C until assayed. Aliquots 100 µl of thromboxane TxB₂ plasma extract or standards 50 to 10,000 pg ml , ³H TxB₂ approximately 15,000 dpm and anti TxB₂ antiserum 0.5 µg 100 µl were combined in 50 mg phosphate buffer 0.1 gelatin thimerosal pH 6.8 were incubated for 16 hours at 4 C. The free and protein bound ³H TxB₂ were separated by absorption onto activated charcoal followed by centrifugation. 1.0 ml of the supernatant was added to an aqueous scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity present was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The binding of ³H TxB₂ in the absence of added TxB₂ was approximately 55 . The minimum concentration of TxB₂ to be detected accurately in the plasma was 50 pg.ml. Cross reactivity with other prostaglandins was less than .005 except with PGD₂ wherein the cross reactivity was 1 . The plasma samples were initially assayed to give approximation of TxB₂ content. The plasma was then appropriately diluted and re assayed in duplicate to give final values. The amount of TxB₂ generated by collagen was calculated by subtracting mean values obtained for the saline stimulated platelets from the mean values obtained from the collagen stimulated platelets. The amount of TxB₂ generated in the presence of each concentration of test compound was expressed as a of control and dose response curves were constructed to determine the concentration of test compound which produced 50 inhibition. These values known as the IC₅₀ obtained for various compounds of the present invention tested are represented in Table II below. All guinea pigs albino male Dunkin Bartley, 300 350g were fasted overnight before use in the test. The test compound was administered by oral dosing needle to conscious animals. All test compounds, if not water soluble, were administered formulated in a 50 PEG 400 50 carboxymethylcellulose mixture as solution or suspension. Oral dose volumes were 0.1ml per 100g body weight. Animals were anaesthetized with pentabarbitone sodium 60mg kg given intraperitoneally approximately 10 minutes before the bleed time. Once surgically anaesthetized, the peritoneal cavity was opened, and 4.5ml blood was drawn into a syringe containing 0.5ml 3.0 trisodium citrate 9 1v v from the abdominal aorta via a 21 23 gauge butterfly needle. The blood was gently mixed with the citrate in the syringe, and transferred to a screwcap plastic tube. Animals were dosed and bled at one hour intervals. Aggregation of the citrated guinea pig whole blood was carried out within 1 2 hours of bleeding, using standard whole blood aggregometry and counting technique. Aliquots 0.55ml of citrated whole blood were heated to 37 c and stirred at 1000 RPM in an aggregometer. An initial 50µl sample of blood was withdrawn for counting, collagen was added, and additional samples were withdrawn at 1,2,3 and 4 minutes. Aggregation was monitored by noting the decrease in single platelet count. Buffer no collagen controls were included. At the end of the four minute incubation for platelet counting, the remainder of each blood sample was allowed to stir for one additional minute. At 5 minutes, 1.0µl of 19mg ml indomethacin dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was added to each sample, resulting in a final indomethacin concentration of 30ug ml. The resulting solutions were mixed 15 30 seconds and cooled on ice. Samples were centrifuged and 150ul of plasma was removed. The plasma samples were frozen until radioimmunoassay for TXB₂. The radioimmunoassay was conducted as previously described at plasma dilutions of 1 20. Two vehicle administered control aminals were run. Groups of at least four The raw data platelet counts Isoton dilutons are converted to whole blood platelet counts, and the fall in free platelet count determined by computer analysis. Inhibition of aggregation was determined from these results, and was indicated by a decrease in platelet count during the 4 minute incubation. Inhibition of the platelet count fall in the early samples only 1 and 2 minutes was taken as indicating an effect on rate rather than total extent of aggregation. Statistical analysis of control and test groups is by Student s t test. The raw results obtained in the RIA from a 0.1ml sample of 1 20 diluted plasma were corrected to pg ml in original plasma sample x200 . The R.I.A. values were then normalized for initial platelet count within the blood sample to 5.0 x 10⁸ ml ¹ range of platelet count in citrated guinea pig whole blood was varied between the limits 2.8 7.0 x 18⁸ ml ¹ . The test and control results were then compared, and inhibition calculated in the normal way. Statistical analysis is again by Student s t test. The results obtained are illustrated in Table III.
