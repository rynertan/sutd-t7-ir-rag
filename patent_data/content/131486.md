# A method of etching refractory metal film on semiconductor structures.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed of etching a refractory metal layer on a semiconductor structure comprising subjecting it to a mixture of a Lewis base and an oxidizing agent. In the prefer red embodiment a method is described for etching a tungsten titanium layer on a semiconductor structure by immersing it in a mixture of triethylamine and hydrogen peroxide.
