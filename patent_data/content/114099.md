# A BUMPER UNIT AND BUMPERS FOR PROTECTING A BOAT

## Abstract
A bumper for protecting the hull of a boat comprising a plurality of one piece bumper units of resilient deformable ma terial positioned end to end. Each of these units has a curved portion with a periphery forming a partial cylinder extending through an arc exceding 180 degrees and a socket portion hav ing a semi cylindrical cavity with a radius equal to the radius of the partial cylinder. Preferably the curved periphery of the par cial cylinder extends through 270 degrees so that the bumper can bend arround a 90 degree corner of the boat. Each unit has a passage extending lenghtwise through both the curved por tion and the socket portion. A rope passes through all the pas sages to connect the units together and form a complete bump er. The units are positioned on the rope with curved portion positioned in the socket portion of the adjoining bumper unit. Preferably a rope cleat is used to fix the bumper units against displacement relative to the rope.
