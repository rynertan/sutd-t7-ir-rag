# Wormwheel gears.

## Abstract
In order to provide a wormwheel gear 1 which is mould able the toothing 2 which is disposed at least about a portion of the periphery of the gear has a decreasing pitch diameter over a first axial portion 6 thereof extending from one trans verse face 3 of the gear and is straight and has a non increas ing, and preferably constant, pitch diameter over a second ax ial portion 7 extending to the other transverse face 4 of the gear. Such a configuration enables a moulding, which may be the gear or a green compact therefor, to be removed from the mould by simple relative axial movement of the moulding and mould, without the need to relatively rotate the mould or moulding.
