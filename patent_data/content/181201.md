# A driver circuit for a bipolar Darlington power transistor.

## Abstract
A driver circuit for a bipolar Darlington power transistor 2 , which comprises a current clamping means 11, 12, 13 which, provided between the base and emitter of said transistor 2 , makes the base emitter path of said transistor 2 operate at a shallow saturated region and a cutting off means 15, 16, 14 which, provided at the side of the said emitter, cuts off said transistor 2 in response to the signal given from the driving power source.
