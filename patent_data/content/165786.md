# BINDER AND SHOE MATERIALS

## Abstract
Novel, improved binders comprising a combination of heat reactive polymers including a copolymer of acrylate, methacrylate, acrylonitrate and a functional monomer and two copolymers comprising one or more hard monomers, one or more soft monomers and up to about 5 percent functional monomer s in different proportions. The novel binders are especially useful as saturants for fibrous sheet materials to provide high quality shoeboard materials.
