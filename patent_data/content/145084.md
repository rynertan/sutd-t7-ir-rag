## Description
BLEACHING COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to a bleaching and cleaning composition, and more in particular to a liquid thickened chlorine bleaching composition which is based on an aqueous solution of alkali metal hypochlorite.Aqueous solutions of an alkali metal hypochlorite are widely used as disinfectant cleaners for lavatory pans, urinals, drains and waste pipes, but may also be employed in the cleaning and bleaching of fabrics.In British Patent Specification N 1 329 086 it has been recognized that the efficiency of such solutions is considerably increased by thickening to viscosities at which they adhere much longer to non horizontal surfaces, thereby enabling them to perform their bleaching cleaning function before draining off.In the British Patent 1 329 086 thickened chlorine bleaching compositions are described, which have an active chlorine content of 1 to 15 by weight and a thickening detergent active system comprising an alkali metal salt of a fully saturated C8 C18 fatty acid in combination with, inter alia, a trialkylamineoxide having a straight chain C8 C18 alkyl group and twoC1 C3 groups.In general, present day bleaching products based on the above thickening system contain the commercially available amineoxides derived from naturally occurring fatty acids such as coconut acids, lauric acid and myristic acid.It has now been found that if a substantial proportion which will be defined below of the long chain alkyl groups of the amineoxide are C16 C18 alkyl groups, the thickening action is significantly improved and accordingly levels of the thickening active system may be reduced. Furthermore it has been found that, in particular if higher proportions of amineoxide have Cia alkyl groups, the weight ratio of the amineoxide to the co active may be decreased, which in general leads to a further reduction in costs.Accordingly the present invention provides a liquid thickened chlorine bleaching composition comprising an aqueous alkali metal hypochlorite solution which is thickened by means of a detergent active mixture comprising a inono C8 C18 di C1 C3 alkylamine oxide, characterized in that at least 20 by weight of the amineoxide component have Cl6 Cl8 alkyl groups.The thickening active system consists of at least two different detergent active components, one of which comprises a trialkylamineoxide having two short chainC1 C3 alkylgroups and a long chain C8 C18 alkylgroup.In order to obtain the advantages of the present invention at least 20 , preferably 20 to 50t, and most preferably 30 to 50 by weight of the amineoxide should contain long chain alkylgroups having 16 18 carbon atoms.Higher proportions of amineoxide having C18 alkyl groups have an increasing effect on the cloud point of the composition and in general allow a reduction of the amineoxide co active weight ratio. Accordingly it is preferred that in the C16 C18 alkylamine oxide fraction the amount of Cl8 alkyl exceeds that of C16 alkyl.The second detergent active component present in the thickener can be an alkalimetal soap or mixture thereof according to British Patent Specification 1 329 086, alkalimetal acylsarcosinates or alkyltaurides according to British Patent Specification 1 466 560 or sugar esters according to Dutch Patent Application 7 605 328, or mixtures thereof. Alkali metal C10 C18 alkylether containing 1 10 moles of ethylene and or propyleneoxide sulphates can also be used. However, the mixtures of trialkylamineoxides and alkali metal soaps of fully saturated C8 C18 fatty acids are preferred.The thickening active system is used in an amount of 0.3 5 , preferably 0.5 3 by weight of the final composition.The composition may be thickened to a wide range of viscosities, preferably from about 10 to 250 cS or even from about 30 to 150 cS as measured with a U tube viscosimeter at a temperature of 25 C. The stability of the composition may be improved by the addition of a small amount, in the order of 0.115 , of alkaline agents, such as for example sodium carbonate, trisodium orthophosphate, sodium hydroxide and the like.The alkali metal hypochlorite will generally be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide from 1 to 15 , preferably 2 to 11 and most preferably 5 to 10 by weight of available chlorine on the basis of the total weight of the composition.Although alkali metal hypochlorites are preferred, other chlorine compounds which yield the hypochlorite ion in alkaline aqueous solution may also be used, e.g. calcium and magnesium hypochlorite, alkali metal dichloro isocyanurate, chloramines and the like.Further, the thickened chlorine bleaching compositions according to the invention may contain small amounts of conventional additives, such as hypochlorite soluble and stable colorants and perfumes. Small amounts of insoluble solid particles are also tolerable.The compositions of the invention can be prepared in conventional ways, for example as described in BritishPatent Specification 1 329 086.The compositions of the invention are useful for all bleaching purposes, especially for bleaching hard surfaces, such as toilets, tiles, floors, kitchen sinks, etc., where by their thickened nature they adhere longer to the surface than non thickened bleaching compositions.The invention will be further illustrated by way of example, in which all percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.The following general composition was used in all examples Ingredients 8 Sodium hypochlorite 15 av.
