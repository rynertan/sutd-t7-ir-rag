# Apparatus for removing a milking set of a milking machine, particularly for a cow shed.

## Abstract
The apparatus has a vertically suspended cylinder 11 with piston 13 . A lifting chord 14 is at one end connected to the milking set 8 and at the other end to the upper side of the piston 13 . It extends upwardly from the piston, leaves the upper end 18 of the cylinder 11 , is guided along a pulley 16 and thereafter extends downwardly to the milking set 8 . Thereby it is prevented that the milking set touches the ground after removing it from the cow and is contaminated. Four different embodiments of the apparatus are de scribed. The apparatus may include a milk flow indicator, having a piece with angled legs 36, 37 49, 50 and electrical contacts 41, 51, 52 one at each side of the angle bend. Thereby accurate determination of the moment in time, in which the set must be removed at the end of the milking process, is achieved.
