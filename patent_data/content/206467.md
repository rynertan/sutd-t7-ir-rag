## Description
Herbicides This invention relates to a method of controlling weeds and to herbicidal compositions for use therein. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of controlling weeds which comprises applying thereto or to a locus at which they are present an effective amount of a benazolin and b fluoroglycofen, either together or in sequence. In another aspect, the invention provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a benazolin and b fluoroglycofen in association with a suitable carrier and or surface active agent. Benazolin is the common name for the known herbicide having the chemical name 4 chloro 2 oxobenzothiazolin 3ylacetic acid. In this specification this name is used to include benazolin as the free acid, as a salt, e.g. the potassium salt or as an ester1 e.g. the ethyl ester.Generally the benazolin is present as the ethyl ester.Whenever rates are quoted herein for the application of benazolin. these refer to the amount of acid equivalent of the compound. Fluoroglycofen is the common name for the known herbicide 2 ethoxy 2 oxoethyl 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy 2 nitrobenzoate. It has been found that unexpected advantages are obtained by using component a in combination with component b . The combination of a and b is synergistic. The present combinations are particularly safe to a number of crop species and may therefore be of use to control weeds selectively therein. Such crops include cereals e.g. wheat and barley , peanuts, soybeans, cotton, sunflowers and rice. Amongst the weeds that may be controlled are mayweeds Matricaria, Anthemis and Chamomilla spp. , red dead nettle Lamium Purpureum , hemp nettle Galeos is tetrahit . chickweed Stellaria media , fumitory Fumaria officinalis , field pansy Viola arvensis , knotgrass Polygonum aviculare , speedwells Veronica spp. , cleavers Galium aParine , pigweeds Amaranthus spp. , fat hen Chenopodium album , black nightshade Solanum nivrum , cocklebur Xanthium spp. , iimsonweed Datura stramonium , morning glory IPomoea spp. , velvetleaf Abutilon theonhrasti , sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia and prickly sida Sida spinoza . The benazolin is usually applied at a rate of 0.01 to 1.0 kgthectare, especially 0.05 to 0.5 kg ha, and the fluoroglycofen is usually applied at a rate of 0.0005 to 1.0 kg hectare, especially 0.005 to 0.1 kg ha. The weight ratio of a to b actually applied or in a composition for dilution before use can thus vary over a wide range.However, it is suitably from 30 1 to 1 10, preferably from 15 1 to 1 1, and especially from 8 1 to 1 1. If desired the compositions may include other suitable herbicides e.g. to broaden the spectrum. Particularly preferred further herbicides include ioxynil, bromoxynil, mecoprop, dichlorprop. MCPA, 2,4 D, 2,4 DB, MCPB, fluroxypyr, clopyralid. cyanazine, bentazone, and the salts and esters thereof. The active herbicides may be applied in a conventional manner, for example by spraying. For simultaneous application, the active ingredients may be tank mixed immediately prior to use, or may be supplied in a concentrate which is usually diluted with water just before use. The concentrate may for example be a dispersible solution which comprises the active ingredients dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent. Alternatively it can comprise the ingredients in the form of a finely ground powder in association with a dispersing agent and intimately mixed with water to give a paste or cream which can if desired be added to an emulsion of oil in water to give a dispersion of active ingredients in an aqueous oil emulsion. The concentrate may alternatively be an emulsifiable concentrate which comprises the active ingredient dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent. The concentrate may also be a granular solid which comprises the active ingredients associated with powder diluents such as kaolin and granulated by known methods.Alternatively it may comprise the active ingredients adsorbed or absorbed on a pre granular diluent, for example Fuller s earth, attapulgite or limestone grit. A dispersible or wettable powder usually comprises the active ingredients in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay. Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the active ingredients with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. In some circumstances it may be desirable to combine two types of formulation e.g. one of the components is present in an emulsifiable concentrate and the second component is dispersed as a powder in this concentrate. The total concentration of the active components in a composition for direct application to the crop by conventional methods is preferably within the range of 0.02 to 1 per cent by weight. For certain methods of application, however, up to 20 per cent may be desirable. In a concentrate composition the total amount of active compound can vary widely, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight. The invention is further described, though by way of illustration only, in the following Example.EXAMPLE Seeds of the plant species listed below were sown in 750 mm diameter plastic pots containing sterilised sandy loam. The pots were the watered and placed in a glasshouse until the plants had 4 or 5 true leaves. The plants then received a foliar spray of the compounds set out below, formulated as a solution in 1 1 by volume of acetone and the wetting agent polyoxyethylene 20 mols monolaurate solution 2 g per litre . The concentration of the test compounds and volume of application were calculated to give the desired rate of application of the compounds in 220 litres per hectare.After a further 44 days in the case of Stellaria media and 14 days in the case of Veronica persia, the plants were visually assessed for percentage herbicidal response relative to an untreated control. In the table, the following designations are employed Compound A Benazolin ethyl ester rate calculated as acid equivalent Compound B Fluoroglycofen.
