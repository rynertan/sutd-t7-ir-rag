# A bobbin supporting textile strands to be subjected to a heat and or wet treatment.

## Abstract
A cylindrical or conical bobbin 1 resiliently compressi ble both in axial and in radial direction and supporting textile strands to be subjected to a heat and or wet treatment comprises an outer grating 3 , the outer side of which forms the curved surface of the bobbin 1 , said curved surface serving as a supporting surface for the strands. The bobbin 1 comprises means 2,2 ,2 ,3,4,5 which retain the grating 3 when the bobbin 1 is not compressed more than a predetermined length in the axial direction in such a manner that the outer surface is positioned in a radial outer position, and which release the grating 3 when the bobbin 1 is axially compressed more than a predetermined length in such a manner that the outer surface is inwardly displaceable into a radial inner position, and which prevent an additional inward displacement of the outer surface. As a result, the bobbin 1 can maintain a constant maximum outer diameter during the winding of the strands on the bobbin and during the later handling thereof, and through a suitable, axial compression of the bobbin 1 a reduction of the outer diameter of said bobbin in obtainable in such a manner that the strands wound thereon may relax in their longitudinal direction.
