# Method of improving release properties of a mold for plastic parts.

## Abstract
Carnauba wax is contacted with perchloroethylene which will extract para methoxy cinnamic acid eaters. The extracted solution is sprayed into the heated mold cavity. The solvent will evaporate leaving a coating of the para methoxy cinnamic acid ester on the mold. After this treatment only a single cleaning shot is necessary and 200 to 250 shots, or more, can be run before a reapplication of the release material is required.
