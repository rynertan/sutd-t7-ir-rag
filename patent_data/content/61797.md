# APPARATUS FOR IN LINE CHECKING OF THE LIQUID LEVEL IN PHIALS

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for in line checking of the liquid level in phials, particularly for the pharmaceutic al industry. The apparatus comprises a conveyor device, an electro nic station for checking the liquid level in the phial and for storing the information, a device for expelling the phials to be discarded, a control and check panel with a counter for the pieces. The electronic station for checking the liquid level in the phial comprises an IR radiation emitting diode and a photocell detector as well as electronic components for discrimination of the electric response indicating anomalous or normal filling of the phial and for processing the corresponding signals.
