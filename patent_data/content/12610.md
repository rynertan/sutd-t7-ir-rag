## Description
This invention relates to the forming of cartons of the type having a plurality of sidewalls each wall hingedly attached to each adjoining wall for angular movement about respective parallel axes and transportable in a folded condition with adjoining sides co extensive or juxtapositioned. The invention is particularly directed to cartons of the above type having four sidewalls which form a rectangular shaped carton, however it is to be understood that the invention is applicable to cartons of other shapes. In order to reduce transportation costs it is customary for a carton manufacturer to produce a carton of the above type in a form so that it may be folded flat for transport and storage purposes, and machines are available for opening the folded carton into an erected state to receive the goods to be packaged. It is the object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for erecting the cartons from the folded condition preparatory to use, which method and apparatus is simpler and more convenient to operate than presently employed methods and apparatus. With this object in view there is provided by the present invention a method of erecting a folded carton of the above type comprising feeding a folded carton to an erection station, holding one sidewall and gripping one adjoining sidewall of the carton at the said station, pivotally moving the gripped wall relative to the held wall to an angularly related position, and permitting the other walls of the carton to freely move to take up positions complementary to the angularly related position of the held and gripped walls. Where the carton has four sidewalls so as to form a rectangular carton, the gripped wall is moved to a position at right angles to the held wall, and as a result of this movement, the other two walls of the carton move to take up a similar right angled relationship. Conveniently, at least the gripped wall of the carton has a flap hingedly connected thereto along an edge at right angles to the hingeable connection with the adjoining walls, and the flap on the gripped wall is pivotally moved relative to the gripped wall during the pivotal movement of the latter so that said flap is disposed between the walls adjoining said gripped wall or respective flaps on said adjoining walls. The movement of the flap on the gripped wall to a position between the adjoining walls or flaps thereon results in the carton being held in the rectangular form resulting from the movement of the gripped wall when that wall is released and the held wall is also released. The carton may then be conveyed from the erection station along a defined path to engage in sequence guide bars which will pivotally move the flaps on the remaining sides of the carton in sequence to a folded condition to form the base of the carton. During this movement, glue may be applied to the flaps at selected locations so that they will be adhered in position when the folding sequence is completed. Preferably the folded cartons are fed to the erection station down an inclined path with each carton in a substantially vertical disposition. The inclination of the path is selected so that the plurality of folded cartons will move down the path to the erection station under gravity with or without assistance from a weighted member. The apparatus for forming cartons in accordance with the present invention comprises means to feed folded cartons to an erection station, means to hold one wall of the carton when in said station, means to grip a wall adjoining said held wall and pivotally move the gripped wall relative to the held wall about the hingeable connection therebetween to a position angularly related to the held wall, whereby the other walls of the carton will be moved in response to said pivotal movement of the gripped wall to positions complementary to the angular relation of the held and gripped walls. The angle through which the gripped wall is moved, is determined by the angular relationship of the adjoining walls in the finished carton. A carton having four walls which forms a finished rectangular shape would require the gripped wall to be moved to a right angular relationship to the held wall.Preferably at least the gripped wall has a flap hingedly connected along an edge at right angles to the connection with the adjoining walls, and means are provided to pivotally move the flap in response to the pivotal movement of the gripped wall so that the flap is disposed between the walls adjoining the gripped wall or respective flaps thereon. The means to grip one wall of the carton preferably comprises one or more suction cups carried on an arm mounted for pivotal movement about an axis parallel to the hingeable connection between the adjoining walls of the carton. Suction is selectively applied to the cups to grip the wall of the carton when in the folded condition, and maintain the grip while the arm is pivotally moved to carry the gripped wall to the required postion, whereupon suction is released. The means to hold the one wall of the carton in the erection station may comprise a member which engages said one wall as the folded carton is presented to the erection station by the feed means and holds that wall against the stock of folded cartons in the feed means whilst the adjoining wall is gripped and pivotally moved to the erection position. Conveyor means are provided to move the erected carton from the erection station and the means which holds the one wall is arranged so that during the movement of the carton from the erection station, the member disengages from the held wall. The invention will be more readily understood from the following description of one practical arrangement of the apparatus for erecting cartons as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the drawings Figure 1 is a plan view of the apparatus, Figure 2 is a side elevation of the apparatus shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a view along line 3 3 in Figure 2, Figure 4 is a view along line 4 4 in Figure 2, Figure 5 is a schematic plan view of the cartons in the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 4 with the foremost carton about to be erected, Figure 6 is a plan view as in Figure 5 after completion of the first operation in erecting the foremost carton, Figure 7 is a side view of the carton in the condition as shown in Figure 6, Figure 8 is a schematic side view of the carton as the second end flap is being folded, and Figures 9 and 10 are schematic side and end views respectively of the carton as the two side flaps are being folded. In one practical arrangement, the apparatus comprises a base frame 10 incorporating a downwardly inclined magazine 11 for the storage of folded cartons as indicated at 12, an erection station 13 at the lower end of the magazine 11, and a conveyor means 14 for transferring the carton from the erection station through a flap folding mechanism 15. As shown in Figure 3 the magazine 11 comprises an inclined base 16 upon which the cartons in a folded condition may be supported in a substantially vertical disposition. Guide rails 17 are disposed to either side of the base to co operate with the vertical edges of the folded cartons. A carriage 18 rests on the upper edge of each guide rail 17 with a plate member 19 extending therebetween in the substantially vertical disposition to engage the rear of the stack of folded cartons in the magazine. The plate member 19 supports the rear of the stack of cartons, and moves downwardly towards the erection station 13 as the cartons are withdrawn from the magazine 11. An advantage of using the plate member 19 in the magazine 11 is that as a number of folded cartons in the magazine decreases, a further quantity of folded cartons can be placed in the magazine behind the plate member 19 without interruption to the feed of cartons to the erection station 13. The plate member 19 may then be vertically withdrawn from between the folded cartons and re positioned at the rear of the newly added group of folded cartons again without interruption to the carton feed. As can be seen in Figures 6 to 11 cartons normally comprise four sidewalls 20, 21, 22 and 23 which constitute an erected carton of rectangular cross section with a flap 20a, 21a, 22a and 23a at the lower edge of each sidewall, and a further flap 20b, 21b, 22b and 23b at the upper edge of each sidewall. The flaps at the lower edge of the sidewalls are folded to form the base of the carton, and after the carton has been filled with the prescribed products, the flaps at the upper edge of the sidewalls are folded to close the carton. As best seen in Figures 3 and 5 a holding member 25 is suspended from a carriage 27 supported on an upper cross member 26 of the magazine to engage an upper flap on one of the sidewalls of the lowermost folded carton in the magazine 11. The carriage 27 is slidable on the cross member 26 to enable the position of the holding member to be set to suit different size and or forms of cartons. The carriage 27 may be locked in the required position by the screw 28. The hold member in the example illustrated is located so that with the carton folded the holding member 11 passes through the slot 24 formed between the upper flaps 22b and 23b on the two forward most adjoining sides of the carton 22 and 23, and engage the flap 20b on the rear sidewall 20 of the forward most carton. The horizontal arm 30 is mounted at one end on the vertical pivot member 31 located adjacent to the edge of the forward end of the magazine. The horizontal arm 30 carries a plurality of suction cups 32 selectively connectable via the conduits 33 to a source of vacuum not shown . The horizontal arm 30 is selectively pivoted by the air cylinder 34 between a position where the suction cups engage the adjacent sidewall 23 of the foremost folded carton as shown in Figures 1 and 5, to a position wherein that sidewall 23 is caused to move through an angle of 900 from that position in the magazine to the position shown in Figures 3 and 6.This pivotal movement of the sidewall 23 of the carton is effected by the movement of the horizontal arm 30, whilst the rear most adjoining sidewall 20 of the carton is held by the hold member 26, and so causes the other two sides 21 and 22 to undergo similar movements whereby the carton is opened from its folded flat condition to form a generally rectangular shape as shown in Figure 6. The flap folding member 35 is fixed to the carriage 36 slidably mounted on the guide rods 37. With the carriage 36 in the retracted position as shown in Figures 1, 2, 6 and 7, the member 35 co operates with the lower flap 23a on the sidewall 23 of the carton as the sidewall 23 undergoes the pivotal movement so that in response to this pivotal movement the flap 23a is pivoted upwardly about its hingeable connection to the sidewall 23 to a generally horizontal position inwardly of and between the two sidewalls 20 and 22 of the carton as shown in Figures 6 and 7. Upon completion of the above described movement, the suction to the suction cups 32 is released so that the suction cups no longer grip the sidewall 23 of the carton, however the flap 23a on the lower edge is retained by the folding member 35 in the horizontal position so that the carton is retained in its general rectangular configuration. The carriage 36 is now advanced in the directionA along the guide rods 37 by a suitable conveyor chain 38 supported on sprockets 39 and 40 driven by motor 41 to transport the erected carton from the erection station through an arrangement of flap folding bars which cause the remaining three lower flaps 20a, 21a and 22a of the carton to be folded to form the finished base of the carton. The pair of fixed folding bars 45 having downwardly inclined forward end 45a are centrally located to engage the lower flap 21a and also clear the lower flaps 20a and 22a as the carton is advanced by the carriage 36. The lower flap 21a is thus moved to a generally horizontal disposition between the sides 20 and 22 of the carton as it advances over the folding bars 45. The movement of the carriage 36 is of an extent such that at the end of the movement both of the flaps 21a and 23a are in engagement with the horizontal portion of the bars 45. Thus the carriage 36 and folding member 35 may be retracted to the initial position to receive a further carton.After a further carton has been withdrawn from the magazine, and positioned on the carriage 36, the forward movement of that further carton toward and onto the bars 45, will advance the carton already on the bars 45 towards and onto the folding bars 46. As the carton is further advanced along the bars 45, with the lower flap 21a held horizontal by said bars 45, the lower flaps 20a and 22a engage the respective outwardly and downwardly inclined forward ends 46a of the fixed folding bars 46. The advancing movement of the carton will thus result in the lower flaps 20a and 22a being folded inwardly and upward ly to respective horizontal positions as shown in Figures 9 and 10. As the flaps 20a and 22a are being so folded they will prevent the flaps 21a and 23a from moving downwardly after they have moved free of the rear ends of the bars 45. The carton is now fully erected and ready to receive goods through the open top thereof defined by the upstanding flaps 20b, 21b, 22b and 23b. The application and release of the vacuum to the suction cups 32, the pivotal movement of the horizontal arm 30 and the conveying movement of the carriage 36 and folding member 35 are controlled in sequence by suitably located switches and or sensing devices. These movements and the extent of the movements may be controlled in accordance with the size of carton being handled and similarly the folding bars 45 and 46 are designed in the conventional manner to meet the requirements of any particular carton. It will be appreciated that the carriage 36 and folding member 35 undergo a cyclic movement, whereby it delivers the erected carton from the erection station to the folding bars 45, and returns to its initial position in preparation for receiving the next carton into the erection station. It will be appreciated that the method and apparatus previously described is applicable to a range of foldable products in addition to cartons as specifically referred to.In particular the invention may be applied to open topped boxes, trays and other products which are constructed with a plurality of hingedly connected sidewalls and may be folded into a flattened condition for transport and storage.
