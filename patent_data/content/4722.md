# Process for the manufacture of multilayer containers.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of multi layered thermoplastic containers 13 which have integral multilayer bottom 15 and side walls 14 , the top of the side walls being circumferentially provided with a single layer flange 18 adapted to be interfolded with metal closures 19 for sealing. In order to simplify the manufacture of the containers and thereby to reduce the cost of the containers, they are made by preparing a multilayer billet 10 having a first and second thermoplastic layer 12, 11 , the layers being so adapted that when the thermoplastic material of the layers is heated to the heat softened state and a compressive force is imposed thereon, the first layer 12 is extruded at a faster flow rate than the second layer 11 heating the billet 10 to place the layers 12, 11 in the heat softened state compressing the billet 10 to cause the extrusion of the heat softened layers 12, 11 into a mold cavity whereby the fastest moving layer 12 forms the flange 18 and exterior surface portions 16 of the container 13 and the slower of the layers 11 forms the interior surface portion 17 of the container 13 .
