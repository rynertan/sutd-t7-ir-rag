# TEST AND MAINTENANCE SYSTEM FOR A DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A test and maintenance system for use with a data processing system comprising a specialized circuit set wherein the circuit set registers can be configured into a serial array, a clock signal distribution system capable of delivering controlled clock signals to selected serial arrays, a maintenance data processor for providing predetermined signal groups, and addressing apparatus responsive to the predetermined signal groups for loading and unloading register arrays in response to the predetermined signals. The disclosed apparatus permits a predetermined signal group to be entered into the serial register array, a predetermined number of clock cycles i.e. series of operations performed on the data , and the resulting signals shifted from the serial register array and signals applies to data processing unit for display or analysis. By comparing the expected result for a given initial state with the actual result of an operation sequence, the accuracy of the operation of a data processing system, or any portion thereof, can be established.
