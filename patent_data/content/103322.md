# Bi directional switching circuit.

## Abstract
A bi directional switching circuit is provided for testing a large number of AC data paths of LSI arrays. The circuit includes a plurality of bi directional pins, a first logic means 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 , and a second logic means 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 . The switching circuit may be used to deskew a general purpose LSl tester wherein any pin may be used for input or output and the pulse at any pin may be inverted. The second logic means, receiving signals on selected pins, initializes the first logic means thereby determining which pins may be used for testing the data path desired.
