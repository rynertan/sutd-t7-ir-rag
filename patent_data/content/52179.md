# Axial flux electric machine.

## Abstract
A core 10 for an axial flux induction electric machine, the core 10 being formed of metal strip wound about a central axis 13 with the strip being punched to have a plurality of holes which are spaced longitudinally of the strip and aligned on the core 10 to form radially extending slots 11 . The side surfaces 15 of each individual slot 11 diverge radially outwardly from the axis 13 .
