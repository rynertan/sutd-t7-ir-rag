# Scan acoustical holographic apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A scan acoustical holographic apparatus and method for sequentially acoustically scanning the interior of an optically opaque volume 11 . The apparatus includes an array of acoustic tranducers 16 that are coupled to the volume for directing acoustic signals into the volume 11 and to receive reflected acoustic signals from the volume 11 , a plurality of frequency divider means 23 receiving high frequency clock pulses and generating electrical pulse signals for transmission by the transducers 16 the phases of these signals being controlled by phase adjusting means 50 in dependence in the distances between the transducers 16 and selected focal points A,B,C within the volume 11 to effectively focus the transducers on the focal point and mixing means 52 for mixing the phase adjusted signals with the received signals to effectively focus the transducers 16 during a receive mode and to generate high amplitude holographic signals when the receive signals are in phase with the phase altered transmitted signals. The resultant holographic signals can be electronically processed to form an electronic analogue hologram which is utilized to visually display a holographic image of the interior of the volume 11 .
