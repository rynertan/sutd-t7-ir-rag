# Polyolefin compositions and articles sterilisable by irradiation.

## Abstract
Polyolefin compositions and articles, especially arti cles of medical ware, such as polypropylene hypodermic syringes, are made more resistant to the embrittlement which accompanies sterilisation by high energy eg gamma irradiation by the addition to a polyolefin of narrow molecu lar weight distribution of a heterocyclic hindered amine and, optionally, a liquid modifier.
