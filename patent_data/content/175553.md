# Well tool with selective bypass functions.

## Abstract
A well tool apparatus includes a housing 12 adapted to connected in a pipe string. A mandrel 124 is slidably received in the housing and adapted to be selectively tele scoped between first as shown and second positions relative to the housing. The mandrel has a flow passage 14 there through and has a lateral bypass port 142 communicating the flow passage with an exterior surface of the mandrel for allow ing well fluids to bypass the flow passage of the well tool as the tool is being lowered into a well. A reversible removable sliding sleeve 340 is disposed about the exterior surface of the man drel and is constructed to abut the housing and to be thereby moved from a first position wherein the bypass port is open to a second position wherein the bypass port is closed, upon telescoping collapsing movement of the housing relative to the mandel. The sliding sleeve has a latch 352 on one end there of. With the sleeve in a first orientation relative to the mandrel, the latch is arranged to engage a latch engagement 358 of the mandrel so as to lock the bypass in a closed position upon the first telescoping collapsing movement of the tool. In a second arrangement, the sliding sleeve is reversed in its position rela tive to the mandrel so that the latch of the sliding sleeve is al ways latched to the housing at 368 , thus providing a tool wherein the bypass port may be repeatedly closed and opened upon repeated telescoping collapsing and extending move ments of the tool. A final arrangement of the tool allows the bypass port and the sliding sleeve to be completely removed to eliminate the bypass.
