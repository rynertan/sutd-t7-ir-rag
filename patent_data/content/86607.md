# Carbon artifact grade pitch and manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A pitch suitable for carbon artifact production i contains from 80 to 100 percent by weight of toluene insolubles, ii has been derived from a deasphaltenated middle fraction which is rich in 2, 3, 4 and 5 polycondensed aromatic ring compounds and or is from a steam cracker tar feedstock and iii is substantially free of impurities and ash and or has less than 15 wt of quinoline insolubles. The pitch is suitably prepared by heat soaking a said deasphaltenated middle fraction and subsequently removing oils therefrom by sub atmospheric pressure stripping.
