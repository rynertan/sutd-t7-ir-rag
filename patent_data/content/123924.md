# Photoconductive material.

## Abstract
A multi layered photoconductive material which com prises first layers containing at least one VIb chalcogen element chosen from S, Se and Te and second layers con taining at least one IIb element chosen from Zn, Cd and Hg and acting as electric potential barriers, said first layers and said second layers being alternatively arranged and the total number of said first layers and said second layers being not less than 5 and has a high response speed and an excellent sensitivety to long wavelength light with a great dark resistance.
