# Electronically controlled heating device for infusion liquids.

## Abstract
A device for heating infusion liquid such as instillation liq uid and blood transfusion liquid which includes a casing 10 , a heating bag 26 and an openable cover 40 . The casing has an open top and a closed bottom, with a liquid inlet section and a liquid outlet section, to thereby provide a compartment for storing the heating bag. Preferably, the casing includes two heating plates 50, 52 mounted on the bottom thereof and three thermosensors 54, 56, 58 provided at the inlet and out let sections and between the two heating plates, respectively. The cover has on the inside thereof a push plate 42 for holding the heating bag against the heating plates. The device includes a control circuit for controlling the two heating plates in accord ance with the detected values of the three thermosensors. With this arrangement, the liquid flowing out of the device can be positively maintained at a constant temperature, irrespec tive of the flow rate of the liquid, the room temperature, the temperature and specific heat of the liquid and other factors.
