# Random styrene butadiene copolymer rubber.

## Abstract
A random SBR having excellent tensile strength, resilience, and abrasion resistance as well as a reduced heat buildup property, which comprises 10 to 40 by weight of styrene units and the balance of butadiene units and has a Mooney viscosity of 30 to 150 a content of butadiene units having 1,2 vinyl structure of 60 or less a ratio Mw Mn of from 1.2 to 3.5 and a content of isolated styrene units of 40 or more and a content of another styrene units in long chain block form of 5 or less, both contents being determined by decomposing the copolymer with ozone and by applying a gel perme ation chromatographic analysis to the ozone decomposi tion product.
