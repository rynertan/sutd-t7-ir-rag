# Ink jet apparatus.

## Abstract
Ink jet apparatus for utilizing hot melt ink comprises a printing head 20 and a reservoir 18 for holding a supply of hot melt ink, the reservoir having a normally open fill tube 25 with an end port face 26 within the volume of the reservoir 18 , the end port face 26 being located at about the volumetric center of the reservoir 18 . The reservoir 18 is maintained with an ink volume of no more than about half of the reservoir volume, so that ink cannot spill through the normally open port 25 when the apparatus is tilted.
