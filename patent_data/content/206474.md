# System for controlling a transfer clutch of a four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
A four wheel drive vehicle has an engine clutch for transmitting the output of an engine to a transmission hav ing two driving ranges, main drive wheels operatively con nected to an output shaft of the transmission, auxiliary drive wheels, and a transfer clutch for transmitting output of the transmission to the auxiliary drive wheels. A control system is provided with a first detector for detecting whether the engine clutch is in partial engagement state or entire en gagement state and for producing a clutch condition signal representing a clutch condition, and a second detector for producing a driving condition signal. The control system re sponds to the clutch condition signal and to the driving con dition signal for controlling torque capacity of the transfer clutch so as to slip the transfer clutch in dependence on the clutch condition.
