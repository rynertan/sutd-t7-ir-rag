## Abstract
A first transducer 7, having a centre frequency f ₂, has a frequency characteristic for transmission T2 and a frequency characteristic for reception R2 . A second transducer 8, hav ing a centre frequency f₁, has a frequency characteristic for transmission T1, and a frequency characteristic for reception R1. T1 partly overlaps with R2 . Therefore, the first transducer 7 could receive reflected signals caused by ultrasonic trans mission from the second transducer 8. To eliminate this cross talk an electrical filter having a frequency characteristic LF is provided, for example, on the receiving side of the first transducer 7. Thus, the frequency characteristics of the transducers 7 and 8 have an inherent filtering function, and this is combined with the filtering function of an electrical filter provided for example on the receiving side of the first transducer 7. Electri cal filters may be provided on the receiving side of the second transducer, or on the transmission sides of the first and se cond transducers.
