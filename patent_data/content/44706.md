# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING AND USING A BORE HOLE

## Abstract
A system for the formation and use of a bore hole, particularly for the recovery of oil from an oil bearing underground formation. An eversible elongate permeable tube 100 , preferably formed of woven cloth, including outer and inner walls, 102, 104 , connected at a rollover area 106 , is urged into the formation by a driving fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped through a central passageway 120 in the tube and carries a central pipe forward 122 . The drilling fluid assists break up of the formation to form a cuttings slurry which passes back along the outside of the eversible tube 100 . Means is provided for turning the tube, as from the vertical to the horizontal, by use of a turning segment in the eversible tube. Such pipe preferably includes a flexible helical seg ment 122b capable of turning and of serving as the ultimate support casing. Also, gravel packing techniques.
