# RESIN COMPOSITION AND CIRCUIT BOARD MOULDED FROM THE SAME

## Abstract
A resin composition comprising 5 60 by weight of fibre obtained by melt spinning an aromatic polyester which exhibits anisotropy when melted and 40 95 by weight of a thermo plastic resin can provide a circuit board which suffers a lineal dimensional change no more than 1 when immersed in a soldering alloy bath at 260 C for 5 seconds and which is also light in weight, nonhygroscopic and has excellent electrical properties.
