# Process for producing a curable resin.

## Abstract
A process for producing a curable resin having unsatu rated groups in side chains linked to polymer main chains tnrough urethane linkages, which comprises reacting A a polymer having hydroxykl groups in its side chains with B an unsaturated monoisocyanate obtained by reacting 1 mole of a diisocyanate with more than 1 but less than 1.8 moles of an unsaturated monoalcohol.
