# Method and reagent for the quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide.

## Abstract
A method of and reagent for determining hydrogen peroxide are disclosed, in which the hydrogen peroxide con taining sample is treated with a colouring reagent comprising a peroxidase, a hydrogen donor and an electron or radical acceptor which react quantitatively with the hydrogen periox ide to produce a pigment which is then measured colorimetri cally. In accordance with the invention the hydrogen donor is specifically a compound of the formula The method and reagent may also be used in the determina tion of other materials such as cholesterol, phospholipid, glu cose and uric acid, by initial treatment with an oxidase thereby quantitatively to produce hydrogen peroxide which is then determined colorimetrically by the method of the invention.
