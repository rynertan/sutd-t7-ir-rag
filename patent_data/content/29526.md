## Description
PROCESS AND DEVICE FOR PERITONEAL DIALYSIS The present invention relates to a process for the peritoneal dialysis and to a device for carrying out the said process. As is known, the process followed at present time for carrying out the peritoneal dialysis comprises sub stantially a first phase during which a tube extending from a pocket containing a dialyzing solution is connected to a free end of a catheter whose opposed end is contained within the peritoneal cavity of the. patient a second phase during which the dialyzing solution contained in the pocket is introduced, through the said tube and catheter, into the peritoneal cavity a third phase during which the pocket, already empty, is being worn by the patient awaiting the solution to receive the salts from the blood vessels by means of the peritoneal membrane afourth phase during which the dialyzing solution contained in the peritoneal cavity and containing the said salts is made to flow into the said pocket and a fifth phase during which the connection between the tube and the catheter is discontinued and the cycle of dialysis may be resumed by repeating in the same order the phases from one to four described hereinabove. The process used at present time and described hereinabove in its main phases, has some disadvantages. In particular, with the said process the risk of infection is high, because, as the end of the catheter to be connected to the tube of the pocket is easily contaminable by the bacteria which are present in surrounding ambient,the flowof the dialyzing solution from the pocket towards the peritoneal cavity involves the introduction into this latter of the bacteria which are present along the connection end of the catheter. This contamination could also give rise to a peritonitis in the patient.In order to reduce as much as possible the risk of infec tion the pocket is utilized also for the discharge of the dialyzing solution from the peritoneal cavity without disconnecting the pocket from the catheter during the dialysis. Thus, the patient must constantly wear the pocket, but this solution of the problem is not welcome by the patient because of the trouble which it involves. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the peritoneal dialysis and a device for carrying out the process, which will be free from the disadvantages mentioned hereinabove. The said object is attained by the present invention by means of a process for the peritoneal dialysis, characterized in comprising a first phase during which a first end of a first tube.conrt unicating by means of a second end with the interior of a pocket containing a dialyzing solution is connected to a first end portion of a second tibe having a second and opposed end portion communicating with the peritoneal cavity of a patient the flow along the said first and second tubes being discontinued by first and second interception means respectively, and the said first and second end portions of the said second tube containing, respctiely, a disinfecting liquid and a part of a dialyzing solution contained in the said peritoneal cavity a second phase during which the flow inside the said second tube is enabled so that the said dialyzing solution,contained in the said peritoneal cavity, and the said disinfecting liquid contained in the said first end portion of the . said second tube will flow towards the outside through the said second tube and a third tube communicating with the said first and second tubes between the said first and second interception means a third phase which takes place at the end of the flow of the said dialyzing solution from the said peritoneal cavity and during which the flow along the said third tube is discontinued and then the flow along the said first tube is allowed to take place so that the said dialyzing solution contained in the said pocket will be introduced into the said peritoneal cavity through the said second tube a fourth phase during which, inDorder, the flow along the said second tube is interrupted, the said first tube is detached from the said second tube, the said first end portion of the said second tube is filled with disinfecting liquid, and the said first end portion of the said second tube is sea e meas of a plug. According to the present invention there is also provided a device for carrying out the said process, the said device being of the type comprising a pocket containing a dialyzing solution and. a f irst tube which communicates with the interior of the said pocket, the said device being characterized in comprising a second tube having a first end portion apt to be detachably connected to a first end of the said first tube, and a second end portion connected in a shrunk fashion to a first end portion of a catheter having a second opposed end portion communicating with the peritoneal cavity of the patient and a third tube communicating with the said first and second tubes, the said second tube having second interception means disposed thereon. For a better understanding of the present invention the main phases of the process according to the invention and the most important characteristics of a device for carrying out the said process will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a view of a device for carrying out the process according to the invention FIGURE 2 is an enlarged and partially sectional view of a detail of the device shown in Fig. 1 FIGURE 3 is a view of a tube connected to a catheter coming out from the abdo tien of a patient FIGURE 4 is a view of the tube shown in Fig. 3, connected to the detail shown in Fig. 2 FIGURE 5 is an enlarged and partially sectional view of the connection between the tube shown in Fig. 3 and the detail of Fig. 2 shown in Fig. 4 FIGURES from 6 to 14 show sequentially the main phases of the process carried out according to the teachings of the present invention and FIGURE 15 is a view of a variant of the device shown in the preceding Figures As shown in Fig. 1, reference number 1 indicates a pocket containing, during the use, a dialyzing solution apt to be introduced into a peritoneal cavity. Connected to the pocket 1 is a tube 2 whose end portion is connected to an end portion 3 of a three way tubular connector 4 this latter has also a second end portion 5 connected to a tube 7, as well as a third end portion 6 closed by a plug 8. portions 3 and 6 are coaxial to one another, whilst the axis of the portion 5 is convergent with the axis defined by the portions 3 and 6. Finally, the tube 7 has its own free end conveniently closed by welding. With par icular reference to Fig. the tubular connector 4 has a central cylindrical portion situated in an intermediate position between the portions 3 and 5 and the portion 6. Extending coaxially from the portion 11 towards the end portion 6 is a pair of concentric rings 12, 13, of which the ring having a larger diameter and indicated by reference numeral 12 has an inner threaded portion 14. Connected to the ring 12 is the said end portion 6 whose diameter is larger than the diameter of the ring 12. Fixed inside the portion 6, for example bey means of an adhesive, is a cylindrical end portion 16 of the plug 8 which has on its outer surface an annular pebreaking groove 17 adjacent the portion 6 of the connector 4. As shown in Fig. 3, reference numeral 23 indicates a catheter, an end portion not shown of which is situated in the peritoneal cavity of a patient.In use, catheter 23 is connected to a tube 24 in particular see Figures 3 and 4 , the tube 24 has a conical end 25 which is mounted in a shrunk fashion within the catheter itself Referring now to Fig. 5, the tube 24 has, at the portion opposed to the end 25, an end 25 provided with diametrically opposed projections 27 each of which is apt to cooperateXin use, with the threaded srf2se 14 of the ring 12.Adjacent the end 26 the tube 24 aa a portion 28 whose outer diameter is slightly smaller than zne inner diameter of the portion 16 of the plug 8 in orderto establish a sealing connection between the tube 24 and the tubular connector 4. B.contri btition to the said seal is given also by the forced cooperation which takes place between the inner surface of the end 26 and the facing outer surface of the ring 13 Fig.5 .Adjacent the portion 28 the tube 24 has a conical portion which forms a convenient handle and facilitates the connection and disconnection operations between the tube 24 and the conne ctor 4. In addition, disposed along the tube 24 are pliers 32 of the klemmer type, apt to intercept the flow of the dialyzing solution along the said tube 24. During the phases of the process according to the present invention in which there is no connection between the tube 24 and the connector d, the tube 24 is providedwith a sealing plug 33 which is threaded internally.In such phases of the process the pliers 32 interrupt the flow along the tube 24 so as to divide the tube main two parts, the part which communicates with the catheter 23 being indicated by reference numeral 34 and containing a part of the dialysing solution contained in the peritoneal cavity, whils the part which is closed by the p1ug 33 is indicated by reference numeral 35 and prefr ly contains a disinfecting liquid. Referring now to Figures from 6 to Id the process for the peritoneal dialysis according to the teachings of the present invention comprises substantially the following phases a first phase during which the flow along the tube 2 of the dialyzing solution contained in the pocket 1 is interrupted by means of pliers 36 so that during the detachment of the outer portion of the plug 8 from the connector 4 the said solution will not flow out a second phase during which the connector 4 is first immersed into a tank 37 containing a disinfecting liquid and then connected to the end 26 of the tube 24 already connected to the catheter 23 and having the pliers 32 in the closure position a third phase during which a cut is made by means of scissors near the welded end of the tube 7 so that by allowing the flow to take place for a limited pre established time along the tube 2 a washing of the tube 7 is obtained a fourth phase during which the solution is allowed to flow along the tube 2, so that the dialyzing solution contained in peritoneal cavity and the disinfecting liquid present inside the portion 3 of the tube 2t and the portion 6 of the connector 4 are made to flow through the tube 7 into a special corta ner not sholm a fifth phase during which the flow along the tube 7 is interrupted and subsequently the the flow along the tube 2 is allowed to take place, so that the dialyzing solution contained in the pocket 1 is introduced into the peritoneal cavity and a sixth phase during which, in order, the flow along tube 24 is interrupted, connector 4 is detached from the tube 24, and, for example by means of a syringe 39, the part 35 of the tube 24 is filled with a disinfecting liquid and finally the end of the portion 35 is sealed by means of the plug 33. Figure 15 shows a variant of the device for the peritoneal dialysis described in relation to Figures from 1 to 5 According to this variant the device comprises the pocket 1 connected to the tube 2, whose end portion is connected to a two way connector 40, which only differs from the connector 4 shown in Fig. 2 in that the end portion 5 is missing. For this reason the constructional elements of the connector 40 which are similar to the constructional elements of the conccetor 4 are indicated by the same reference numerals. In addition, the device shoxXm in Fig. 15 is provided with the tube 24 from which, however, upstream of the pliers 32, a tube 41 is branched whose free end is shaped like the welded end of the tube 7 Fig. 1 and a second end of which is connected to a connector 3 similar to connector 40. The said tube 40 is intended to facilitate the discharge operations of the dialyzing solution from the peritoneal cavity. Referring to Fig. 15, a part 44 is defined which is apt to contain a disinfecting liquid and comprises the part 35 of the tube 24 and the tube 41 itself. The univocality of the process according to the present invention remain ing unchanged, the substantial difference between the two devices described herein consists in that in the first device Figures from 1 to 5 the discharge tube indicated by reference numeral 7 is branched from the tube 2, whilstin the second device Fig. 15 the discharge tube,indicated by reference numeral 41, is branched from the tube 24. The process realized in accordance with the teachings of the present invention has numerous advantages. In particular, with the said process a sterilization downstream of the possible contamination is ensured, inasmuch as the connection between the connector 4, 40 and the tube 24 is made exclusively in the presence of disinfecting liquid therefore, the risk of infection is drastically reduced. Moreover, in the process of the invention the discharge of the dialyzing solution from the peritoneal cavity towards the outside is carried out after the connection between the connector 4,40 and the tube 24 has been established, so that an additional washing is carried out. The patient is not compelled to wear constantly the pocket 1, bat only the tube 24 which may be of reduced dimensions and therefore is not troublesome for the patient moreover, the tube 24 may be utilized for very long periods of timeFinally, the process according to the invention allows a simplification of the peritoneal dialysis technique, as well as a reduction of the time of application of the device for carrying oost the process. Finally, it is clear that modifications and variations may be made to the phases of the process and the characteristics of the device for carrying out the said process, without departing from the scope of the invention.
