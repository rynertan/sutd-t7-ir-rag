# Molten metal sampling device.

## Abstract
In a molten metal sampling device comprising the following components in combination i a porous filter 13 ii holding means 9 for said filter iii a hollow conduit 7,10 running from a point adjacent to and below the filter through the holding means to a covered reservoir and iv vacuum means connected to the reservoir 4 through an aperture in the cover 2 , the components being positioned in such a manner that molten metal can be drawn through the filter in a downward direction and, then, through the conduit into the reservoir, the improvement comprising a providing a recess 15 in the holding means 9 b in the upper portion of the recess, providing a hollow cup 12 , snugly fitted, but removable open at both ends and with a peripheral seat 18 intermediate of both ends on which the filter 13 resides c providing a removable stopper rod 14 , which fits into that portion of the cup 12 above the filter 13 and d providing a contiguous lining 8 for that part of the conduit 7 , which will not be submerged in the molten metal, and for the reservoir and its cover, said lining comprising an insulating material inert and essentially impervious to molten metal, but permitting the passage of gases therethrough.
