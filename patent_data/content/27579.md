# Improved capacitor lead clips.

## Abstract
A clip 10 for electrical conductors comprises a generally rectangular metal strip with piercing tangs 14,15 projecting from each end. The strip is folded into a triangular configura tion which is used to encircle the conductors. At the apex the piercing tangs are folded inwardly and abut each other. An anvil tool 25 at the apex forces the tangs to penetrate the conductors while the tangs support each other in abutting relationship and there enter a central aperture 21 in the base of the clip for a clinching action.
