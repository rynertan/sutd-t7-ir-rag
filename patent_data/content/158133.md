# Vacuum manipulator system.

## Abstract
Apparatus in a vacuum deposition system positions a workpiece holder 11 in substantial alignment with a source 18 of material to be deposited onto a workpiece affixed to the workpiece holder. The apparatus also rotates the work piece holder about the deposition source and linearly drives the workpiece holder to varying distances from the deposi tion source. The apparatus used to drive the workpiece holder is sealably mounted atop an opening 41 in the vacuum chamber 10 . The apparatus enables multiple source depositions to be carried out consecutively without accessing the vacuum chamber. By aligning the workpiece holder over the deposition source, nonuniform deposition onto the workpiece is substantially eliminated.
