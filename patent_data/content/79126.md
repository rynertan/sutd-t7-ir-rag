# Pool cleaning device for operation under floating pool cover.

## Abstract
A positive buoyancy programmed motion pool cleaning device is adapted for operation under a floating pool cover C . The pool cleaning device is given positive buoyancy with floats A, B fore and aft, both floats A, b being adapted to provide positive buoyancy towards the pool cover C while riding on an upper water bearing against the under surface of the pool cover C . In this adaptation each float A, B defines a concavity 17, 19 having a circumscribing annulus 27, 23 . At the interior of the concavity 17, 19 there is an outlet 60 of a high volume, low pressure jet pump P . Typically the high volume, low pressure jet pump P includes a low volume, high pressure jet entraining and expanding water flow from beneath the floats A, B through and elongate tube 45, 46 up, to, and discharging within the concavity 17, 19 . Preferably, the concavity 17 and pump outlet 60 are arranged with the pump outlet 60 somewhat off center of the annulus 21 walls so that pool cover C plugging of the pump outlet 60 does not occur. In operation, the concavity 17, 19 forms a water bearing pressure pocket. The pressure within this pocket is sufficient to provide positive fluid force lifting the cover C . Reactive forces on the floating pool cleaning device place a force opposing the buoyant force of the floats A, B . Travel of the device a sufficient distance under the cover C results so that a fluid bearing exists between the floats A, B and cover C at all times. The resultant fluid bearings provide a high lubricity interface permitting the programmed motion of pool cleaning device to continue without significant friction with the cover C interrupting operation.
