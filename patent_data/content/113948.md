# Pipe coupling.

## Abstract
An insulating pipe coupling for ship to shore pipework comprises an annular body 4 with a circumferential series of cut aways 7 at each end, the cut aways at each end being staggered so that each cut away 7 at one end is aligned with the castellated formation provided between two cut aways at the other end. Respective through holes 10 connect the cut aways 7 with the end faces of the opposed formations 8 and accommodate bolts 11 used to secure one of the two flanges 1, 2 , to the insulating body 4 . Thus the sets of bolts secured to the respective flanges 1 and 2 are kept well separated from one another. A PTFE liner 16 may be provided.

## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE PIPE COUPLING The present invention relates to a pipe coupling and more particularly to a insulating pipe coupling for interconnecting ship to shore, and similar, pipework. A voltage difference always exists between a ship and the adjacent shore, e.g. the jetty to which it is moored. This voltage diference is produced by a the cathodic protection system of the ship, shore structure or both b galvanic action c stray currents in ship on shore structure or both. The voltage differences have been found to be sufficient to cause incendive arcing between metal components connecting ship and shore. In order to prevent such ignition sources occurring, particularly where on or off loading inflammable products, it was hitherto considered safe practice deliberately to connect ship to shore by an electrically conducting bonding wire. However, experience has shown that the currents flowing through the bonding wire may be sufficient to cause unacceptable heating. It has not been possible to specify the size of bonding wire which would always be adequate for the currents flowing. For this reason, it was decided that ship and shore should remain electrically separate and various port authorities are bringing into force regulations requiring that measures are taken to keep the ship and shore structure electrically separate. TheInternational Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals calls for an insulating flange to be inserted in the ship to shore product lines. The insulation need not have a very high resistance a few ohms is probably sufficient but its integrity must be good. Because of the hard use to which such an insulating flange or pipe coupling may be put, it is preferable that its insulating properties derive from the material from which it is made, rather than from any insulating coating. One proposed construction of an insulating coupling consisted of a cylindrical body of insulating material having radially outwardly directed annular flanges at each end, the two flanges having through holes for bolting the flanges to mating flanges on the ship and shore pipework. A third radially outwardly directed flange was provided intermediate the ends of the cylinder so as to occupy the space between corresponding securing bolts of the two end flanges and prevent metal items from bridging the two. Although effective, this pipe coupling was difficult to make with adequate strength because of the amount of material which had to be removed in its manufacture. According to the present invention there is provided a pipe coupling comprising a body having a through bore and, at respective ends, annular end faces for mating with the flanged ends of two conduits which are to be coupled, each end of the body being provided with a circumferential array of castellated formations formed by cut aways at the junction between the respective end face and periphery of the body, each cut away having an end wall offset axially inwardly from the adjacent end face, with the castellated formations at opposite ends angularly offset so that each castellated formation at one end is aligned with a respective one of the cut away of the other end, with a through hole extending between the two ends to receive the shank of a bolt. It will be appreciated that since the cut aways accommodate the heads of respective securing bolts or the associated nuts, depending on which way round the bolts are inserted bridging between circumferentially adjacent bolts, which are secured to respective ones of the pipe flanges, is easy to achieve without the need for a great deal of machining of a nature likely to reduce the strength of the pipe coupling. Preferably there is an un cut away axial central portion of the body so that the end walls of the cut aways at the two ends are offset axially of the body relative to one another. This should assist in maintaining the strength of the pipe coupling and additionally make it even more difficult for conductive bridges to occur between the bolts secured to the respective pipework flanges. Preferably, for use in the application mentioned earlier, the body of the pipe coupling is made from an electrically insulating, or substantially electrically insulating i.e. greater than a few ohms end to end resistance material and any additional parts which may constitute the pipe coupling are made of such a material and are so arranged so that there is no possibility of their causing a short circuit between the flanges to which the coupling is connected. The invention will be further described by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of one embodiment of the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the pipe coupling of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an end elevation of the pipe coupling of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a side elevation of the pipe coupling of Figure 1 and Figure 5 is a partial cross sectional view of the pipe coupling of Figures 1 to 4 installed between two pieces of pipework. Figure 1 shows the annular flanges 1 and 2 at the opposed ends of pieces of ship to shore pipework which are to be interconnected by a pipe coupling 3 according to the present invention. The pipe coupling 3 is in the form of an annular body with a coaxial, cylindrical through bore made of a strong, easily machinable insulating plastics material such as polypenco nylatron GSM with two end faces 5 and 6 which are perpendicular to its longitudinal axis.At each end of the body 4 there is a circumferential array of cut aways such as 7 into the peripheral surface and end surface of the body 4. The cut aways 7 are all similar to one another and are equally angularly spaced around the axis of the body 4 with the cut aways 7 at one of the body 4 being aligned with castellated formations 8 formed by the part of the body 4 between adjacent cut aways at the opposite end. It will be appreciated, therefore, that the angular displacement between the two sets of cutaways is half the angular displacement between adjacent cut aways in each set. A respective through hole 10 extends between the inner end wall 9 of each cut away, which end wall 9 is also perpendicular to the axis of body 4 and the opposite end of the body. Each through hole 10 accommodates the shank 11 of a bolt, the head 12 of which is accommodated in the associated cut away 7. The threaded part of the bolt 12 extends through the mating flange, such as 2, and is secured by means of a nut 13. It will be seen from Figure 2 that each cut away 7 has a radially inner wall portion 14 which conforms to a part cylinder whose axis coincides with that of the corresponding through hole 10. Apart from being relatively easy to mill, this part cylindrical surface portion accommodates the rotation of a key 15 which may, if necessary, be a specially fabricated allen key, and is used to tighten the bolts 12.It will be appreciated that the fact that each castellated formation 8 extends radially outwardly beyond the heads of the bolts 12 in the circumferentially adjacent cut aways 7 provides a measure of protection for these heads. Also, the fact that the inner end walls 9 at opposite ends of the body 4 are spaced to opposite sides of the longitudinal medium plane of the body 4 means that it is difficult for short circuiting bridges to occur between bolts respectively connected to the two opposed flanges 1 and 2. The coupling may be provided with a PTFE liner 16 having a cylindrical middle section accommodated in the through bore of the body 4 and two annular end flanges 17 and 18 which preferably extend across the annular sealing faces 19 and 20 constituted by the portions of the end faces radially inwardly of the radially innermost parts of the cut away 7. The liner 16 is intended to protect the main body of the coupling against incompatible products. The flanges 17 and 18 are shaped so as to be inclined outwardly when in an unclamped condition.
