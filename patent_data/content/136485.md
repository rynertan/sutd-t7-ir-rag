# PROCESS MONITORING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROGRAMMABLE CONTROLLERS

## Abstract
A process monitoring apparatus for programmable controllers monitors controlled process information such as process input and output states or running operation numbers and display the information after superposing the same on a source program. The apparatus preliminarily generates the source program to be displayed from the object program and stores it such that upon monitoring the controlled process only the fetching of the controlled process information is effected and the information is superposed on the source program thereby displaying it. Also, the prog rammable controller has its control executive section B and monitoring console A constructed separable from each other so that the two sections are connected only during the monitoring and means 9A is provided to detect the connection thereby automatically effecting the generation of the source program and making it possible to make a high speed monitoring at any time after the completion of the connection.
