# Clamp arm load handling structures for lift trucks.

## Abstract
A parallel arm clamp assembly 16 has longitudinally movable elongate slide members 28 ,30 mountable transversely on the front of a lift truck and attach ing members 32 for connecting forwardly protruding rela tively narrow opposing clamp arms 18 ,20 to the ends of the slide members to as to extend perpendicular thereto. Each slide member 28 ,30 has an elongate rear portion 28a ,30a longitudinally mounted within a slide guide 24 , 26 and a longitudinally extending elongate front portion 28c , 30c external of the respective guide protruding for wardly therefrom. The clamp arm attaching members 32 each have a pair of legs 32a , 32b formed monolithically and homogeneously into a single member with the legs oriented at substantially a 90 angle with respect to each other. One leg 32a of each member is connected in end to end abutment with an end surface 28d , 30d of a respec tive front portion 28c , 30c of a slide member so as to be in a common plane with the latter. The second leg 32b of each attaching member 32 protrudes forwardly for end to end jointing with the rear edge of a respective clamp arm 18 ,20 . The arrangement provides a mechanically strong and fatigue stress resistant clamp arm mounting structure without physically restricting load handling capacity.
