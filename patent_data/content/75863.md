## Description
Improved Polyphenylene Ether and Polyalkenyl Aromatic Resin CompositionsBackground of the Invention Thermoplastic compositions containing polyphenylene ether or oxide in admixture with alkenyl aromatic resins are well known. Examples are, for instance, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,383,435 of Eric P. Cizek, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.Such compositions are most generally employed in the production of molded and or extruded articles. A major drawback of these compositions is their inherent flamniability and the side effects of conventional flame retardants. Most commonly, these retardants have adversely affected the very properties most important to the uses of these compositions.Introduction to the Invention The present invention relates to improved, flame retardant thermoplastic compositions of polyphenylene ether and polyalkenyl aromatic resin. Incorporation of an admixture of triarylphosphate and cyclic phosphonate having the formulaEMI1.1 wherein x O or 1 has been found to provide desirable flame retardance without loss of the important physical properties of the resin blend. Description of the Invention The polyphenylen8 oxide resins useful in accordance with the present kinds of compositions are, as previously indicated, individually well known and readily available. There are, however, various preferred composition components. These are primarily ones commonly having applications for which high impact strength is particularly desirable. The preferred polyphenylene ethers are homc and copolymers of the formula EMI2.1 wherein Q, Q , Q and 0 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenol nucleus, hydrocarbonoxy radicals and halohydro carbonoxy radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atoms and the phenol nucleus and Q , Q and Q in addition may be halogen with the proviso that Q and 0 are preferably free of a tertiary carbon atom and n represents the total number of rono mer residues and is an integer of at least 50. especially preferred is polyX2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether. The alkenyl aromatic resins are likewise well known and are preferably derived from monomers of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl or alkenyl groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and hydrogen R3 and R4 are selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo, hydrogen and lower alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms R5 and are selected fron the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl and alkenyl groups cf from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or R5 or R6 may be concatenated together with hydrocarbyl groups to form a naphthyl group. These compounds are also desirably fre of any substituent that has a tertiary carbon atom. Specific examples of alkenyl aromatic monomers include styrene, chiorostyrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl xylene, divinylbenzene and vinyl naphthalene.Styrene is particularly preferred. As is described in the Cizek patent, modifiers such as butadiene may be incorporated into the alkenyl aromatic resins to improve the properties of resultant compositions. Other such modifiers are also known.These include block and hydrogenated block copolymers sch as are described in U.5. Patent No. 3,660,531 cf Lauchlan et al. or V.5. Patent No. 4,167,507 of Haaf. Similarly, graft modified polymers are described inU.S. Patent No . 3,943,191 3,959,211 3,974,235 4,101,503 4,101,504 4,101,505 and 4,102,850 ofGlen D. cooper Ct al. All of these modified polyalkenyl aromatic resins are also within the scope of the present invention. The polyphenylene ether and polyalkenyl aromatic resin may be present in virtually any propora tion in the present blends. For optimum physical properties in the blend, however, they are preferably in a weight ratio of from about 1 4 to 2 1, respectively. Both of the constituents of the present fire retardant admixture are also individually well known and available commercially. It is the corbination of these triarylphosphate and cyclic phosphonate compounds in the subject blend of polyphenylene ether and polyalkenyl aromatic resin which provides the unexpected advantages of the present invention. While any triarylphosphate may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, triphenyl phosphate and tri isopropylphenyl phosphate are preferred.They appear to provide maximum fire retardance with minimum adverse affect on the physical properties of the thermoplastic blend. The use of such triarylphosphates in such blend is described in, for example, U.S. PatentNo. 4,101,505 of Cooper et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The cyclic phosphcnates of the present inven tion should have the fcrmula EMI5.1 wherein x 0 or 1.Combinations of retardants of this formula are also desirable. The use of such retardants is described inU.S. Patent Nos. 3,189,091 and 3,849,368 of w.oSil Chem., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The triarylphosphate and cyclic phosphonate may be admixed in any proportion. Preferably, however, they are employed in a mole ratio of from 0.1 1 to 10 1, most preferably of from 1 3 to 3 1, respectively. The amount of the admixture cf these fire re tardants incorporated into the thermoplastic composition may also vary widely. While there must be an effective amount of retardant, from about 1 to 25 and most preferably from 2 to 15 by total composition weiSht have proven more desirable, The compositiens of the present invention are preferably prepared first by fine admixture of their jnSredients they are ten desirably melt blended. This may, for example, be accomplished simply by coextrusion. A substantially homoceneous admixture is preferred. Once prepared, the present compositions may be utilized for any of the diverse purposes for which similar polyphenylene ether polyalkenyl aromatic resin compositions have already been employed. For example, they can be used in molding powder formulations, either alone or mixed with other polymers such as the polyolefin and may contain various fillers, such as diatomaceous earth, carbon black, silica, etc., to make molded parts, such as spur, helical, worm or bevel gears, ratchets, bearings, cams, impact parts, gaskets, valve seats for high pressure oil and gas systems or other chemical fluids requiring resistance to chemicals, etc. They can also be used to prepare molded, calendered, or extruded articles1 films, coatings, threads, filaments, tapes and the like. They can be applied to a broad spectrum of uses in tbe form of sheets, rods, tapes, etc. and are useful in electrical applications, such as in cable terminals, terminal blocks, backing for electrical circuits, as components of dynamoelectric machines that operate at high temper atures, etc. Films of these compositions can be prepared by suitable means, such as by calendering, extrusion, etc.These films are useful as metal or fiber liners, containers, covers, closures, electrical insulating tapes, as sound recording tapes, magnetic tapes, photographic films, pipe and wire tapes, etc. As a coating material, they can be applied as a solution or suspension to any convenient foundation where a surface possessing their excellent Frcpertses is desired. The excellent electrical properties make laminates of this material useful for electrical equippent, such as lot wedges in the armature of an electric motor, panel boards for printed circuits, electrical appliance panels, radio and television panels, small punched electrical pieces, transformer terminal boards, transformer coil spacers, etc. The present compositions may also be mixed with various fillers, modifying agents, etc. such as dyes, pigments, stabilizers, etc. Additional thermoplastic resins and or fire retardants may also be incorporated. All this may be performed in a conventional manner. The following examples are given by way of illustration only and are not intended as a limitation on the scope cf this invention. Many variations are possible without departing from its spirit and scope.Unless otherwise specified herein all proportions are provided on a weight basis. EXAMS US Several blends of polyphenylene ether FPO and polystyrene PS , some containing varying mounts of constituents of the present fire retardant admixture, are prepared. The retardant constituents employed are K 50 a tri isopropylphenyl phosphate produced by FMC Corp. and Artiblaze 19 a cyclic phosphonate produced by Mobil Chemical Company. The ingredients are first dry mixed and then melt blended in an extruder. The flame and physical properties of the resultant samples are tested to observe the effect of the present retardant admixture.

These results show the unexpected Superiority of compositions containing the present admixtures. Sample 2, containing only triaryl phosphate, exhibits marked improvement in flame retardance over the blend alone Sample 1 . However, this improvement is at the expense of undesirable loss of heat distorticn temperature. Samples 3 and 4 containing only cyclic phosphen ate, emphasize the relatively greater amount cf such re tardant necessary to achieve a satisfactory fire rating. Moreover. they indicate the proportionate decrease in impact strength accompanying a satisfactory rating. For Sample 5, the advantages of the present invention become clear. All properties are satisfactory at a lesser total retardant concentration than eitherSamplos 2 or 4. Moreover, the high impact strengths are achieved even for a reduced polyphenylene ratio at which this property would normally decline. The above patents and or publications are incorporated herein by reference. Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible, in light of the above teachings. For instance, instead of poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether, copolymers such as poly 2,6 dmethy1 co 2,3,6 trimethyl 1,4 phenyltne ether can be used. Other ingredients such as fillers and or reinforcements, drip retardants, plasticizers, anti oxi2ants, colcrants, can be included in ccnventional ancunts. It is therefore, to be understood that changes may be made in the particular erbodiments of the invention described which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
