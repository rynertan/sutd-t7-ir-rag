# Heat developable color photo sensitive material.

## Abstract
A heat developable color photo sensitive material com prising a support bearing a photo sensitive component layer comprising a photo sensitive silver halide, a reducing agent, a binder and a dye providing material characterized in that at least one of said dye providing materials is a polymer having a repetition unit which is derived from a monomer of Formula I Z Y wherein Z is a benzyl or 1 naphthyl group, substituted in the 4 position with hydroxyl, which is optionally further sub stituted Y is oxygen or sulfur Q is an ethylenically un saturated group and M is hydrogen, an ammonium group or a monovalent metal atom produces a sharply reproducible image which has little color turbidity.
