# Method of making veneered board with grooves milled into the surface.

## Abstract
In making veneered chipboard 1 with grooves 5 milled into the surface, strips 3 of solid wood are embedded in the chipboard before veneering takes place, in those places where the said grooves are to be milled. After veneering the said grooves 5 are milled into the veneer 4 and the underlying solid strips 3 . This prevents exposure of chipboard material by the milled grooves 5 .

## Claims
PATENT CLAIMS 1. Method of making veneered chipboard with grooves milled into the surface, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by strips of solid wood being embedded in the board before veneering takes place, in those places where the said grooves are to be milled, and by the said grooves being milled in the veneer and the underlying solid strips after veneering. 2. Method according to Claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e C. by strips of a V shaped cross section.being embedded in the chipboard.

## Description
The present invention is a method of making veneered chipboard with grooves milled into the surface. In making e.g. cupboard doors it is customary to use veneered chipboard, which is much less expensive and, e.g.as regards resistance to dampness, also better than solid wood. Doors made e.g. of solid oak are often so called plank doors, i.e. doors consisting of boards or planks joined between two solid end pieces or fixed in a solid frame. Attempts at imitating plank doors by milling into veneered board a number of grooves corresponding to the spaces between the individual planks will fail because the grooves will expose the chipboard located under the veneer. This is avoided in the present invention because strips of solid wood before veneering are embedded in the chipboard where the said grooves are to be milled, and after veneering has taken place grooves are milled into the veneer and the underlying solid strips. As working with solid wood and chipboard in the same structure involves a considerable risk that the finished board will curve or otherwise twist, it is expedient according to the invention to embed strips of a V shaped cross section in the chipboard. This will not only save solid wood the thickness of solid wood after the required grooves have been milled will also be so moderate that oblique tension in the structure is avoided. A detailed description of the invention is given below in connection with the drawing which step by step illustrates the making of veneered chipboard by employing the method represented by this invention. Into the surface of a chipboard 1 V shaped grooves 2 are milled in those places where grooves are to be milled into the finished board after veneering. In these grooves a strip 3 of solid wood is embedded. Thereupon the chipboard 1 is provided with a layer 4 of veneer. In this layer 4 of veneer and the underlying strip 3 the required groove 5 is now milled. The said groove 5 will not expose chipboard material, and the thickness of the remaining part of the strip 3 is so insignificant that stresses, i.e. the tension of the veneer, will be equal on both sides of the finished board so that warping is avoided. Using veneered chipboard gives a surface which is profiled as if the board had been composed of solid planks, but at a price far below the price of solid wood and with the good strength properties of chipboard.
