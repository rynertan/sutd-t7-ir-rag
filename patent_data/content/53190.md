# CROSSLINKED VINYL CHLORIDE RESIN FOAM AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME.

## Abstract
A process for continuously manufacturing, under ordinary pressure, heat resistant crosslinked vinyl chloride resin foam having a low density and uniform, fine cells, which process comprises a first step of gelling a mixture of vinyl chloride resin, plasticizer, stabilizer, crosslinking aid, and blowing agent under such conditions that the blowing agent is not decomposed, and then molding the thus gelled mixture into a desired shape a second step of crosslinking the resulting molding by irradiation with an ionizing radiation and a third step of heating the thus corsslinked product to expand it.
