# Safety barrier.

## Abstract
This invention is related to a safety barrier positionable in a doorway or passageway to prevent the passage of small children or animals. The barrier comprises a frame assembly having a substantially rectangular structure with upper 4, 5, 16 and lower 1 frame elements, each extending from one side of the passageway to the other. The frame assembly is provided with independently adjustable clamping means 12, 13, 14, 15 at each corner thereof for securing within the passageway. At least a portion of the frame assembly is in the form of a gate which is openable to allow access through the barrier. The gate is provided with further clamping means 22 to lock the openable portion in its closed condition, said further clamping means acting to increase the overall stability of the barrier within the passageway.
