## Description
ENERGY ACCUMULATOR UNITThe present invention refers to an energy accumulator unit suited for receiving energy from an external source and for delivering it to a utilization system, wherein the energy exchanges occurring between the unit, the source and the utilization system are had by means of a pressure fluid, which is conveniently an oil.In machines and apparatuses belonging to various fields of the technique, energy accumulators are widely used. They serve the purpose of storing, for a certain period of time, often a short one, a quantity of energy that is supplied by any system, and then during a successive period of returning said energy to the same or to another system. The use of such accumulators usually has the purpose of obviating any sudden variations of energy that could occur during the operation of said systems by abnormal stresses in any elements of the system itself, which could be the cause of damages,or else of allowing for the consumption or dissipation of energy that should be removed from a first system and transferred to another one, from where it is no longer possible to recover or regenerate the energy for being appropriately utilized.One example of use of energy accumulators of the first type mentioned is that of an energy accumulator intended for avoiding overloads in a piping network line of a hydraulic system, caused through any sudden pressure increase taking place at some point of the network. It is known that in such an instance, there are usually employed accumulators wherein the compressibility of a gas, our a mixture of gases, is utilized for transferring a certain quantity of energy into these accumulators. An example of the second type of accumulator is the one intended for storing at least a part of the energy generated during the braking of a vehicle, and for restoring said energy to the engine system of the vehicle at the termination of the braking operation with,in this manner, preventing any heat dispersion of this energy.The energy accumulators normally utilized in apparatuses and machines of various types for realizing the aboveindicated aims are usually rather complex in their construction, unreliable in their operation, noisy, and rather heavy and cumbersome, also in view of the fact that the amount of stored energy per volume unit and or weight is very negligible.One aim of the present invention is that of realizing an energy accumulator unit which is devoid of the drawbacks mentioned above, and which can advantageously be utilized for diverse applications.According to the present invention, there is realized an energy accumulator unit, apt for receiving energy from an external source and for feeding said energy to a utilization system, the energy exchange occurring between said unit, said source and said utilization system taking place by means of a pressure fluid, and characterized by the fact of comprising at least one hydraulic cylinder that presents a casing and a piston which is movable with respect to said cling in the direction of the axis of the cylinder itself and defining with it a chamber for housing said fluid, with control means being present apt for controlling a feed port for said fluid that arrives from said chamber source, and an outlet port for sending said fluid out from said chamber towards said utilization system, and at least one elastic system connected to said casing and to said piston of the hydraulic cylinder in such a way as to be elastically deformed, following the movement of the piston with respect to the casing, and in such a way as to originate elastic forces due to the said elastic deformation, the resultant of which passes through said cylinder s axis. The control means mentioned above are preferably apt for being disposed in a first position, where said feed port is open and said outlet port is closed in such a way as to feed said fluid into said chamber by deforming said elastic system, in a second position, where said feed and outlet ports are both closed so as to maintain said elastic system deformed, and in a third position, where said feed port is closed and said outlet port is open for feeding said pressurized fluid towards said utilization system.For better understanding the structure and the operation of the unit of the invention, there will now be given herebelow the description of certain forms of its realization, with reference to the attached drawings, whereby FIG. 1 schematically represents a vertical section of the accumulator unit of the invention in its rest position.FIG. 2 represents a section similar to the one shown in FIG. 1 , wherein the unit is in its working position.FIG. 3 represents a vertical section of another form of realiza tion of the accumulator unit of the invention in its working position.FIG. 4 represents a partial section in a lateral view of the unit shown in FIG. 3.FIG. 5 represents a section of the unit of FIG. 3 along the line V V of FIG. 3.FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 schematically represent apparatus parts, on which the unit of the invention is used. An energy accumulator unit of the invention indicated in its whole by 1 is represented schematically in its undeformed as well as deformed configurations in FIGURES 1 and 2. It is apt for receiving energy from a surce 2 of hydraulic fluid,which is disposed for feeding a pressure fluid, and which, for example, is a hydrostation, a pump, a hydraulic cylinder, or simply any whatsoever piping network in a hydraulic system, where a pressurized fluid is present. The unit 1 of the invention is apt for delivering or distributing said energy to any whatsoever utilization system 3, that can be activated by a pressurized hydraulic fluid, for example, an engine or a hydraulic cylinder or simply a hydraulic network system.The unit 1 of the invention comprises at least one hydraulic cylinder 4, that presents a casing 5 and a piston 6 movable inside the casing 5 in the direction of the axis a a of the cylinder 4 and defining with it at least one chamber 7 for the above said fluid. Said unit 1 comprising,moreover, control means 8 apt for controlling a feed port not shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 for admitting the fluid arriving from source 2 into chamber 7 through a conduit 9, and an outlet port not shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 for discharging the fluid from the chamber 7 through a conduit 10 towards the utilization system 3. The unit 1 of the invention also comprises an elastic system 12 which is connected both to the casing 5 as well as to the piston 6 of cylinder 4 in such a manner as to be elastically deformed following a shifting or moving of the piston 6 with respect to the cylinder 4 for the purpose of originating opportune elastic forces, the resultant of which passes through the axis a a of the cylinder 4.An elastic system having these characteristics can conveniently comprise at least one pair of elastic elements 13 apt for being deformed substantially by traction and compression, when the piston 6 moves with respect to the casing 5, and which are disposed parallel to the axis a a of the cylinder 4 and to parts that are diametrically opposite with respect to it.Said elastic elements 13 can conveniently be closed strips or rings of rubber, each one of which is mounted on a pair of props 14 and 15 which constitute supporting saddles for the ring 13 itself and which are secured, the first one to a first head 16 fixed to the rod 17 of the piston 6, and the second one to a second head 18 fixed to the bottom or base of the casing 5 of cylinder 4. Conveniently, whenever the unit 1 is in its rest position FIG. 1 in which the piston 6 is in one end position towards the top of FIG. 1 , each elastic ring 13 is mounted on the corresponding pair of props 14, 15 with a predetermined initial deformation in such a manner that the relative tracts 20 result as being slightly stretched.In FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, there is shown an accumulator unit 1 similar to the one of FIG. 1, which is provided with elastic rings 13 that are identical to those indicated by 13 in FIG.1.The structure of the elements and of the parts of this unit 1 which have been indicated with the same reference numerals used in FIGURES 1 and 2, differs slightly from the previous one as can clearly be seen from the relative FIGURES. In said form of realization, the casing 5 of the cylinder 4 presents an end bushing 23 provided with a plain bearing 24 for the rod 17 of the piston 6, the latter two elements have the same diameter.The secondhead 18 has the shape of a slab. It is coupled with an end pin 25 of the casing 5, and leans on one shoulder 26 of the casing 5. The props 15 which are now six in number are supported by a pair of plates 27 fixed to the head 18, or by these plates 27 and the casing 5 by seating one end of each prop 15 in a corresponding recess of the casing.The first head 16 has the form of a transom and in one of its recesses there is inserted the end of the rod 17, locked to the transom 16 by a cylindrical bar 28, the end parts of which form the props 14 for the elastic rings 13. The props 14 are connected to aBóther by means of plates 29 and,as can be seen in the FIGURES 3 to 5, on each pair of props 14, 15 there is mounted a pair of elastic rings 13 spaced apart from each other by a spacer washer 31.The feeding to and the discharging of the hydraulic fluid from the chamber 7 can take place through a hole 30 FIG.3 .Other holes 32, 33 in the slab 18 and in the transom 16,re spectively,can be utilized for connecting together several units in a manner which shall be described later on.The operation and the utilization of an accumulator unit 1, as described above, take place in the following manner One or several of these units 1 can be connected to a source 2 of pressurized fluid and to a utilization system in the way shown in FIGS.1 and 2.When the unit 1 is in its rest position, the elastic elements 13 keep the piston 6 in its upper end position,as shown inFIG. 1.In order to activate the unit 1 and to store a certain amount or quantity of energy within it, it is sufficient to act upon the control means 8 for opening the feed port 30 that leads into the chamber 7 and which is controlled by these means.In this manner, the pressure fluid,by acting upon the piston 6,moves it downwards see FIG.1 with elastically deforming the elastic rings 13,the rectilineal tracts 20 of which become stretched. Moving the piston 6 with respect to the casing 5 can be continued till the former arrives at its lower end position,as shown in FIG. 2.In said configuration, the energy of the pressure fluid that was required for realizing the relative movement between the piston 6 and the casing 5, obtained by overcoming the elastic reaction originated by the deformation of the elastic elements 13, is now found stored in the unit 1 in the form of potential elastic energy.Next, by acting upon the control means 8 the feed port 30 that leads to the chamber 7 can be closed. In this manner, the energy stored in the unit 1 can be reserved for whenever required. When the energy has to be used in the utilization system 3, the outlet port of the chamber 7 is opened and the pressure fluid is discharged through it towards the system 3 for carrying out some motive work. Hence, during the utilization of the energy accumulated in the unit 1, a transformation takes place, changing the potential elastic energy into pressure energy, in the sense opposite to that which was verified during the storing of the energy.The energy that can be accumulated in the unit 1 is very great in quantity or amount if compared to the volume of the unit 1 itself. What is in fact evident is that the space in the unit 1,which is occupied by the elastic elements 13,which are intended for accumulating potential elastic energy, is the greater space since the space occupied by the other parts cylinder 4, control means 8, heads 16, 18 and relative associated parts is very reduced.There is also realized, moreover, a light weight and very compact assembly with restricted overall dimensions. These favourable characteristics are derived from the constructive simplicity of the unit 1 itself, and the moderate weight of the elastic elements 13 that consist of simple rubber rings. Moreover, the operation of the unit 1 takes place substantially, without emitting any noises, and it is absolutely reliable and safe. In fact, the structure of the unit 1 is extremely simple and only small slippings are had between the coupled surfaces piston 6, casing 5 that are perfectly lubricated by the hydraulic fluid. Moreover, the resultant of the forces generated by the deformation of the elastic elements 13 passes constantly through the axis a a of the cylinder 4, and hence, no transversal actions or forces are originated on their parts, which could produce crawlings and an irregular operation.In FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, there are shown schematically some examples of the utilization of the accumulator unit 1 of the invention.In the example of FIG. 6 the unit 1 is simply inserted along a tract 34 of a pipeline of a hydraulic network system. In such a use the control means 8 can remain constantly open, keeping in constant communication, at all times, the chamber 7 with the tract 34 of the pipeline of the hydraulic network system. It is evident that under such conditions, whenever a sudden pressure increase in the hydraulic fluid in the network is verified, owing to a variation of the exercise conditions, at least a part of the energy resulting from the variation of pressure is first stored in the unit 1 and subsequently returned into the network system again. In this manner, any overloading known as nwater hammering in the pipeline network system can be prevented or else notably reduced. In the example of FIG.7,the unit 1 is connected to a hydraulic actuator 35 which can be made to function either as a motor or as a pump, and from which the unit 1 receives hydraulic fluid through a first conduit 9 or to which the unit 1 can return the fluid through a second conduit 10. The above said motor or pump can be actioned through a hydraulic control station 36. A device of this type can be conveniently utilized for actioning one of the driving wheels 37 of a vehicle. Through this device, a system is realized for regenerating braking energy when during a braking phase the actuator 35 works as a pump, and also when the control means 8 become actioned for sending fluid to the actuator 35 as soon as the functioning of the actuator 35 is switched over so that it works as a motor. In this manner, at least a part of the energy needed for braking the vehicle becomes stored by the unit 1, and from there it can be returned to the actuator 35 as soon as the latter once again reassumes its driving action, after the braking is over.In the example shown in FIG.8, the unit 1 forms part of a vehicle suspension, for example, of an automotive suspension.The verticle forces acting on the wheel 37 of a vehicle are sustained by a standard hydraulic actuator 38 that can also be utilized in association with other elastic elements of traditional type connected in the previously indicated manner to the unit 1. With this disposition, vertical movements of the wheel 37 generate pressure variations in the chamber 7 of the unit 1 and produce corresponding stretchings of the elastic elements 13 of the unit 1. Hence, in such a suspension, the elastic action can be carried out, either completely or partially, by the elastic elements 13 of unit 1, while the damping action can be controlled by acting upon the control means 8.It is obvious that, by suitably controlling the ports or openings, between the chamber 7 of the unit 1 and the hydraulic actuator 38, it will be possible to vary the flow of the fluid passing through said ports upon which the damping action really depends.It is obvious that the unit 1 of the invention can also be conveniently utilized in various other applications which are different to those that have been described hereabove solely by way of example. It also results as obvious that the elastic system 13 with which the unit 1 is provided and which is conveniently realized by the elastic rings 13 can also be of a diverse type and can comprise spring systems of any whatsoever type. In fact, the ends of a cylindrical spiral spring of steel could be connected to the props 14, 15 FIG.1 , and said ends could be twisted during the relative movements between the piston 6 and the casing 5, and through said torsioning deformation potential elastic energy can be stored.However, should the elastic system of the unit 1 only be comprised of deformable rubber elements 13, not only would these confer to the unit 1 a considerable capacity for storing energy apart from its also being endowed with having reduced overall dimensions and being light weight, but they will also provide that certain damping action which is typical for rubber and which could result as being particularly advantageous for any kinds of applications. Several units of the type described can be connected one to the other in parallel by securing the heads 18 and 16 of these units together, and by providing appropriate hydraulic connecting means for feeding the fluid into the relative chambers 7, and for discharging the fluid from them. In order to connect the heads 16, 18 to one another, there can be utilized the holes 31 and 32 FIG. 3 made in the heads themselves for introducing through them the coupler plugs, or any other suitable connecting elements.To end with, it results as obvious that, to the general structure of the unit and to the various parts comprising it, there may also be effected some modifications and variations, without departing from the ambit of the invention.
