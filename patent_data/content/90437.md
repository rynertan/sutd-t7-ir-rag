# Process for the production of hydrocarbon oil distillates.

## Abstract
Distillates are produced from asphaltenes containing hy drocarbon mixtures by a process comprising subjecting the hydrocarbon mixtures to thermal cracking, and subjecting the resulting heavy fraction to a combination of a catalytic hydro treatment and a solvent deasphalting.
