# Improvements in or relating to fuel rod end plugs.

## Abstract
A nuclear reactor fuel rod end plug 100 is adapted to be welded within each end of a nuclear reactor fuel rod cladding tube, especially by means of laser beam welding techniques, although TIG welding techniques may also be employed. An annular groove 126 is defined about the external periphery of the end plug 100 so as to extend radially inwardly of the long land region 118 of the plug 100 within the vicinity of the juncture of the land surface 118 and the shoulder portion 120 at which location the girth weld between the end plug 100 and the cladding tubing will be defined. When employing laser beam welding techniques to accomplish the butt type girth weld between the plug 100 and the cladding tube, the groove 126 serves to eliminate porosity defects within the weldment. When employing TIG welding techni ques to accomplish the butt type girth weld between the plug 100 and the cladding tube, the groove 126 serves to eliminate porosity defects within the weldment without requiring the plug land 118 and shoulder 120 surfaces to be accurately machined in accordance with precisely critical dimensional tolerances as well as the mating surfaces of the cladding tube.
