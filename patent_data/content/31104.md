The compounds I of this invention can be prepared by following process. i A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula IIJ EMI5.1 wherein RA and RB may be protected by any suitable groups e.g., lower alkyl, acyl, aralkyl, aralkyloxy, etc. whenRA and RB include reactive groups e.g., amino, hydroxy, mercapto, hydroxyamino, etc. , with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula 1II e.g., acyl halide, acid anhydide, mixed anhydride, active ester, lactone, etc. by general methods used in peptide syntheses or amide formation reactions HOOC W CO RC III , wherein W and RC may be protected by any suitable groups e.g., lower alkyl, acyl, aralkyl, aralkyloxy, etc. whenW and RC include reactive groups e.g., amino, hydroxy, mercapto, hydroxyamino, etc. , followed by removal of protective groups by well known methods e.g., hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, ammonclysis, alcoholysis, etc. . This procedures c deprotecticn can be applied in the following methods. ii A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of IV e.g., above mentioned HOOC W1 L IV , wherein W1 isEMI6.1 and may be protected such as i above, L is a leaving group e.g., halogen, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, etc. , by the same methods as described in i above to produce a compound of the formula V EMI6.2 and then reation of a compound of the formula V with a compound of the formula VI H X Wê Y W Z W4 CO RC VI , wherein W2is EMI6.3 W4 isEMI6.4 and Wê, W , W4, X, Y, Z and RC may be protected such as i above, in the presence of p oper alkaline and or organic bases, if necessary, by known methods. iii A. compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula VII e.g , metioned in i above HOOC WÚ X Wê L VII and then with a compound of the formula VIII Y W Z W4 CO RC VIII by the same method as ii above. iv A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula IX e.g., mentioned in i above HOOc WÚ X Wê Y W L IX , and then with a compound of the formula LX H Z W4 CO RC X by the same method as ii above. v A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid XI e.g., acyl halide, acid anhydride, mixed anhydride, active ester, lactone, thiolactone, etc. HOOC W1 X H wI , and then with a compound of the formula XII L Wê Y W Z W4 CO RC XII by the same method as ii above. vi A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula XIII e.g., mentioned in v above HOOC WÚ X Wê Y H XIII and then with a ccflpound of the formula XIV L W Z W4 CO RC XIV by the same method as ii above. vii A compound of the formula I is yielded by the reaction of a compound of the formula II with the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula XV . e.g., mentioned in v above HOOC W1 X W2 Y W3 Z H lXV , and then with a compound of the formula XVj L W4 CO RC XVI by the same method as ii above viii A compound of the formula I is also yielded by converting a compound of the formula I prepared by any method above metioned by well known methods e.g., oxidation, formation of oxime, hydrazone and semicarbazone, addition to double bond, etc. The compounds I of this invention are effective on preventing or relieving diabetic complications. In diabetic patients, high levels of hexoses e.g., glucose, galactose. etc. in blood lead to the accumulation of sugar alcohols e.g., sorbitcl, galactitol, etc. in tissues. It is known that this accumulation causes the swelling of cells to induce ccmplications of diabetic cataract, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, etc. R. Quan Ma et al., Biochom. Diophys. Res.Comm., 22, 492 1961 . or example, R. Gitzelman et al. have presented that cataract is caused by the accmulaion of sugar alcohols Exptl. Eye. Res., 6, 1 1967 . A report of Kinoshita et al. has demonstrated that aldose reductase which reduced aldose to the corresponding sugar alcohols was involved in the initiation of these diabetic complications and that effective inhibitors of alose reductase were useful Jpn. J. Ophthalmol., 20, 339 1976 .On the basis of the above information, aldose reductase inhibitIon of the compounds I of this invention was tested.The results of the examinations demonstrated that these compounds have potent inhibitory activities on aldose reductase, and therefore they are useful as drugs for therapy or prophylaxis of the diabetic complications. On the other hand, it has been known that a kind of the derivatives of thiazolidine or pyriolidinecarborylic acid have potent inhibitory activity to angiotensin I converting enzyme, DUt thiazolidine and pyrrolidine compounds o thisInvention are novel compounds, and have more potent inhibitory activities to angiotensin I converting enzyme. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are prepared by convenient methods, and are superior to the stability. Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as therapeutic or prophylactic agents and antihypertensive agents. The compound of formula I can form the conventional salts to be generally ustd as medicine such as sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt, magnesium salt, alminum salt, ammonium salt, diethylamine salt, triethanolamine, etc. The compounds of formula I have the stereoisomers which are within the lin.lt of this invention, because they have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. Typical examples are shown below, although this invention is not limited to these examples.

PHARMACOLOGICAL TEST 2 As the method of measurement of angiotensin Iconverting enzyme activity, bioassay fo the contractile response of isolated smooth muscle or the press response of normal animals and biochernical assay for the enyme isolated from lung or other organs of animals are known. The former is found more advantageous than the latter for the examination of the convertion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vivo. In the present study, therefore, we adopted the bioassay for contractile response of isolated guinea pig ileum to angiotensin I. Method Isolated guinea pig ileum was suspended ip the organ bath containing 20ml of Tyrode s solution of 30 C gassed with 95 O2 5 CO2. The contraction induced by the addition of angiotensin I 0.1g rnl at intervals of 10 minutes was recorded on a recticorder Nihon Koden for 90 seconds using FD pick up ST 1T H, Nihon Koden The test compounds were added to the bath 5 minutes before the addition of angiotensin I. The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was calculated by the following formula. A B A x 100 A contractile intensity of angiotensin I before addition of the compound B contractile intensity of angiotensin I after addition of the compound From the fact that kininase II, which destroys bradykinin having contractive action on isolated guinea pig ileum, is thought to be identical with angiotensinI converting enzyme augmentation of the contractile response to bradykinin by test compounds was examined by using bradykinin 0.005pg ml in place of angiotensinI according to the above mentioned method. Result Concentration of a number of the compounds of this invention, which produced 50 inhibition of angiotensinI activity or augmentation of bradykinin nativity inducing the contraction of guinea pig ileum, fell in the range of 10 10 9M. PHARMACOLOGICAL TEST 3 The activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was measured by spectrophotometry according to the method of D.W. Cushman and H.S. Cheung Biochem. Pharmacol., 20, 1637 1971 . That is, the absorbance of hippuric acid was measured, which is livberated by incubating hippuryl L histidyl L leucine HHL as substrate in the presence of angiotensin I converting enzyme extracted from rabbit lung. Method The reaction mixture is as follows 100mM phosphate buffer pH 8.3 300mM sodium chloride 5mM H IL 10 3 10 9M enzyme inhibitor 5mO enzyme 0.25ml of the above mixture was incubated at 370C for 30 minutes and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.25ml of 1 N hydrochloric acid. To this solution, 1.5ml of ethyl acetate was added in order to extract hippuric acid. 1.0ml of ethyl acetate laier was collected and evaporated to dryness, and the residue obtained was dissolved in 1.0ml of water. The absorbance of this solution was measured at 228nm. The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was calculated by the following formula Percent inhibition A B 100 A A absorbance of reaction solution before addition of the compound B absorbance of reaction solution after addition of the compoundConcentration of compound producing 50 inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme IC50 The solution containing compounds at the concentration of 1 x 10 3M to 1 x 10 9 was incubated and percent inhibition at each concentration was calculated according to the above formula, and then IC50, concentration of the compound producing i0 inhibition of the enzyme activity was determined.
