# Electric well pump.

## Abstract
An electric pump assembly for lifting fluids in wells comprises a plurality of electric pumps 20 located at axially spaced apart locations in the well each pump having an axial aperture 21 to permit wire line operations to be conducted in the well below the assembly. Adjacent pumps 20 can rotate in opposite directions about a common axis to effect torque balancing. Each pump 20 can have a transformer to permit local adjustment of voltage and means 40 are provided for sequential operation of the pumps. Assembly can be supported on cable, or on production tubing assisted by packers.
