# Electro conductive elastomeric devices.

## Abstract
An elastomeric electro conductive device 10 capable of providing within a predetermined range of elastic elongation λ of the device 10 sensory signals representative of elastic elonga tion λ imposed on the device comprises an elastomeric electro conductive member 11 bonded to an elastomeric substrate 12 . Member 11 and substrate 12 have substantially similar resistance to stretch characteristics Ø within the predetermined range. On a Mooney Plot for λ ¹ values in the range 0.5 to 0.8 Ø is substantially constant at 0.4 M Nm ².
