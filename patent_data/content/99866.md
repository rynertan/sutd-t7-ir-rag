# Electrolytic cell anode.

## Abstract
An improved anode for acting as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis. The anode material is formed from a host matrix including at least one transition element, preferably Co, Ni or Mn, which is structurally modified by incorporating one or more modifier elements, one of which may also be a transition element, Modifier elements, including for example Co, Ni, Sr, Li, In, K, Sn, C, O, Mn, Ru and Al structurally modify the local chemical environments of the host matrix. The material may also include a leachable modifier element, such as Li, Al or Zn, which is partially removed to further modify the material and enhance its catalytic activity. After formation by vacuum deposition techniques, the material may be subjected to a heat treatment in an oxygen containing atmosphere and or subjected to an electrochemical treatment such as a treatment or a rapid anodic cathodic pulsing to increase the catalytic activity of the material by forming highly active oxides.
