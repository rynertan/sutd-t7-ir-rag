# Fixture for inserting locking tubes in reconstitutable nuclear fuel assemblies.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fixture for inserting locking tubes into control rod guide thimble extensions positioned in passageways through the adapter plate of a top nozzle of a reconstitutable nuclear fuel assembly. The fixture comprises a tool guide 54 , and an insertion tool 98, 102 . The tool guide 54 is adapted to be mounted upon, and to be releasably locked to, the top nozzle 20 and it has guide openings 68 arrayed such as to be axially aligned with the respective guide thimble extensions 46 when the tool guide is in place, each of the guide openings 68 contaioning a resiliently deformable sleeve 72 for receiving and releasably retaining a locking tube 48 . The insertion tool includes a plurality of rods 102 which are insertable through the respective guide openings 68 and into the guide thimble extensions 46 aligned therewith, each rod having a leading portion 106 which is movable through and into the associated guide opening and guide thimble exten sion, respectively, and a trailing portion 104 which defines a shoulder 108 for transferring the locking tube 48 from the sleeve 72 into the aligned guide thimble extension 46 upon operation of the insertion tool. The fixture permits a full complement of locking tubes to be inserted simultaneously while the resiliently deformable sleeves prevent escape and loss of the locking tubes.
