# Single regulation power supply with load compensation of an auxiliary voltage output.

## Abstract
Single regulation power supply with load compensation of an auxiliary voltage output, wherein power is transferred from the primary winding of a transformer to a first and a second secondary windings each coupled to a rectifying and filtering network respectively providing in output a main and an auxiliary voltage, where a control loop senses the alge braic sum of the main output voltage and the voltage drop caused in a resistor by current drained by a load from the auxiliary voltage output and controls current pulses applied to the primary winding so as to keep constant such sum, whereby rendering the auxiliary voltage unsensitive to load changes at the auxiliary output, at any desired extent deter mined by the value of such resistor, with the trade of a limited degradation in the control of the main voltage output.
