# Organosalts of metalate anions and process for the production of alkylene glycols therewith.

## Abstract
Novel vicinal dioxyalkylene organometalates comprising a cation having a hydrocarbyl containing substituent are disclosed. The vicinal dioxyalkylene organometalates can be reacted with water to yield alkylene glycols.
