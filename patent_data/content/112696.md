# UNDERWATER SEISMIC ENERGY SOURCE

## Abstract
Disclosed is an underwater seismic energy source which includes a plurality of airguns. Each of the airguns has substan tially the same size, weight and external configuration, but the internal capacities are configured such that when the guns are fired the primary pulses interfere constructively and the bubble pulses interfere destructively. Each of the airguns is connected in the same way to an individual tow line, each having the same length. When the airguns are towed, they all maintain substantially the same depth, even without flotation devices such as Norwegian buoys or rigid floats.
