# Substrate wiring patterns for mounting integrated circuit chips.

## Abstract
An IC chip connected to a substrate 10 by a pattern of pads 12 arranged in single lines along the radial edges of segments 15 of a polygon underlying the chip linear conductors from the pads cross the outer edge of the segments in parallel groups. Wider power conductors 232, 233 can also be placed in the pattern.
