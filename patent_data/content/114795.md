# ARRANGEMENT AT ROLLING MILL

## Abstract
An arrangement at rolling mills, especially sheet and strip rolling mills, for supporting work rolls 2,46,70 therein, which rolls have smooth shell surface 4 along at least a substantial portion of their length, and two or more hydros tatic bearings 3,6,7,59,60,61,69 acting against said smooth shell surfaces 4 are provided for supporting the work rolls. The arrangement is characterized in that the bearings 3,6,7,59,60,61,69 are movable to positions, in which they contact the smooth shell surfaces 4 , that their portions 15,17,28,30,36,39,63 thereby contacting the shell surfaces 4 have small area and a lower wear resistance than said shell surfaces 4 . The arrangement further is characterized in that hydrostatic pressure medium is intended to controlled flow out between said portions 15,17,28,30,36,39,63 and the shell surfaces 4 .
