## Abstract
Circuit arrangement for reducing the occurrence of spurious signals on an output of an electronic circuit when the circuit power supply is switched on and off. In order to avoid the occurrence of spurious signals on the output 3 of an electrical circuit 1 when the circuit power supply is switched on and off, this output 3 is disconnected from the remainder of the circuit under the control of a control device 5 . This control device comprises a current mirror whose input path T₁, R₁ is arranged in series with a first resistor R₃ and whose output path T₂, R₂ is arranged in series with a capacitor C₁ between the first 10 and the second 20 power supply terminal. The input and the output path are connected to the bases 12, 14 of two transistors T₃, T₄ which are arranged as a differential pair and whose commoned emitters are coupled to the positive power supply terminal 10 by means of a second resistor R₄ . After switching on of the power supply the capacitor C₁ is charged via the current mirror T₁, R₁ T₂, R₂ , so that the differential pair transistor T₄ which is coupled to the transistor C₁ gradually turns off in favour of the other transistor T₃ of the pair. As a result of this, the output 3 is connected to the electronic circuit 1 some time after switching on of the power supply. When the power supply is switched off the differential pair transistors T₃, T₄ are cut off immediately, so that the output 3 is disconnected immediately from the electronic circuit 1 .
