## Description
This invention relates to display systems. A video display device or system in which a plurality of display cells are arranged in an X Y matrix form and the cells are respectively driven by desired data to display a desired image or picture has already been proposed. The present applicants have proposed a display cell that can be used in the above mentioned video display device. The previously proposed display cell is shown in Figures 1 to 4 of the accompanying drawings which are, respectively, a front view of the display cell a luminescent or fluorescent display cell , a sectional view taken on a line A A in Figure 1, a sectional view taken on a line B B in Figure 1, and a partially cut away perspective view of the cell. The cell includes a glass envelope 1 comprising a front panel 1A, a rear panel or plate 1B and a side wall 1C. Within the glass envelope 1 are disposed a plurality of luminescent or fluorescent display segments or elements 2 2R, 2G, 2B , a plurality of cathodes K K A separator 10 formed of a conductive material is disposed to surround the display segments or elements 2R, 2G and 2B. The separator 10 not only serves as a shield for preventing secondary electrons 31 see Figure 6 , induced by impingement of the electron beam 30 from a wire cathode K against the first or second grid G₁ or G₂, from rendering an adjacent display segment luminous, but serves also to form a diffusion lens which functions to spread the electron beam 30 from each wire cathode K so that the electron beam is radiated throughout the corresponding display segment 2. In addition, the separator 10 is used also as power supply means for supplying a high voltage e.g. 10 kV to each display segment. In assembling the cell, the separator 10 is supported between the front panel 1A and side wall 1C of the glass envelope 1 and fixed by frit. More specifically, as shown in Figure 7, the separator 10 is in the form of a frame partitioned into three to surround the display segments in the manner of a honeycomb, and outwardly projecting supporting pieces 11 are formed on first opposed upper ends thereof while anode leads 12 are formed on the other opposed upper ends for the supply of high voltage anode voltage . Furthermore, outwardly bent elastic positioning portions or pieces 13 are formed on the side portions of the separator 10. When the separator 10 is inserted from above into the inside of the side wall 1C, as shown in Figure 8, the supporting pieces 11 abut the upper end face of the side wall 1C to thereby support the separator 10 and, at the same time, the bent portions 13 abut the inner surface of the side wall 1C to thereby position the separator 10 in central fashion. Also provided on the upper end portion of the separator 10 are inwardly bent lugs 14 each having a projection 15 formed on the surface thereof. When the front panel 1A is placed and sealed on the side wall 1C after enclosing the separator 10 in the side wall 1C, the projections 15 contact the carbon layer 3 or the metal backing layer 5 see Figure 9 . As a result, the high voltage from the anode leads 12 is fed in common to the display segments 2R, 2G and 2B. In the assembled state, the anode leads 12 to which the high voltage is applied are led or extend out to the exterior through the sealed portion between the front panel 1A and the upper end face of the side wall 1C, while the leads of the wire cathodes K, first grid G₁, and second grid G₂ are led or extend out to the exterior through a sealed portion between the rear plate 1B and the side wall 1C. The leads of the cathodes K, first grids G₁ and second grid G₂ are brought out together for supporting purposes For example, in each of the first grids G The glass envelope 1 is completed or assembled by sealing the front panel 1A, side wall 1C and rear plate 1B with respect to each other by frits 22 see Figure 9 . A chip off pipe 21 for gas exhaust is fixed by frits to the rear plate 1B. The operation of the cell of the above construction will now be explained. An anode voltage of, say, 10 kV or so is supplied through the anode leads 12 to the red, green and blue display segments 2R, 2G and 2B. A voltage of, say, 0 30 V is applied to each of the first grids G This luminescent or fluorescent display cell 40 is constructed in thin fashion as a whole. Also, the low voltage side leads such as the cathode and first and second grid leads are led or extend out from the rear panel 1B side of the glass envelope 1, while the high voltage side anode leads 12 are led or extend out from the front panel 1A side. Therefore, possible dangers during discharge and wiring can be avoided, thus ensuring a stable luminescent or fluorescent display. Moreover, since the separator 10, to which the anode voltage is applied, surrounds each display segment 2, a diffusion lens is formed by the separator 10. Therefore, even if only the first grids G₁ are curved and the second grid G₂ is flat or planar as shown in Figure 6 , the electron beam from each cathode K spreads laterally in the direction of the slits 8 and 9 and is radiated to the entire surface of the display segment 2. At the same time, secondary electrons from the first or second grids G₁ and G₂ are obstructed by the separator 10, so the adjacent cut off segment is not rendered luminous. In the case of a colour display for example, in the case of a 9300 K white picture , the luminance mixing ratio is about 7 blue, about 13 red, and about 80 green. In the case where wire cathodes are used as an electron emission source, they are in many cases used in a temperature restriction area in order to maintain their service life. The problem of making the luminance of the green cathode higher than that of the other cathodes can be solved by increasing the number of green cathodes used. For example, two green cathodes K Since the wire cathodes are used in the temperature restriction area, that is, the loading of the oxide cathode is set at a ratio of one to several tens to prevent a red looking appearance, the amount of electrons emitted per cathode is small. One method of solving this problem may be substantially to enlarge the surface area of oxide by winding a tungsten wire spirally, for example. But, in the case of a long spiral, it is likely that loosening or vibration of the cathode will occur. In view of this point, a construction as shown in Figures 10 and 11 may be employed. In the construction of Figures 10 and 11, a core 35 formed of a high temperature material such as, for example, tungsten or molybdenum, is provided, and its surface is coated with an insulating material 36 such Al₂0₃. Then, tungsten wire 37 serving as a heater is wound spirally thereon and an electron emissive material 38, e.g. carbonate, is bonded to the spiral portion by spraying or electrodeposition to constitute a direct heating cathode 34. The core 35 is fixed at one end thereof to one support member 6 and at the other end thereof to the spring portion 7a of the other support member 7 by spot welding or other suitable means, so as to be stretched under tension. The tungsten wire 37 is fixed between one support member 6 and a second support member 6 on the other side by spot welding or other suitable means. Thus, in the above construction, the cathode is wound spirally onto the core 35 coated with the insulating material 36, and the core 35 is stretched by the spring portion 7a, whereby problems such as shorting between spiral portions and thermal deformation of the spiral can be eliminated. Also, the oxide surface area is substantially increased, and a uniform temperature distribution area A with reduced temperature difference between both ends and the centre of the cathode becomes wider. As a result, the amount of electrons emitted can be increased, and as a whole, therefore, it is possible to increase the amount of allowable current per cathode. The curve I in Figure II represents the temperature distribution. In the luminescent or fluorescent display cell formed as described above, since the separator 10 supplied with the same high voltage as that applied to the display segments or elements 2 is positioned to surround the plural display segments, a diffusion lens is formed whereby an electron beam from the cathode K is spread laterally and radiated to the entire surface of each display segment or element. Consequently, it is possible to provide a high luminance display. Furthermore, by virtue of the presence of the separator, secondary electrons from a control electrode or accelerating electrode are obstructed, so as not to render the adjacent cut off display segment luminous, and a stable luminescent or fluorescent display thus can be effected. To make a picture display system or device by using the above described luminescent or fluorescent display cell, the following assembly procedure is adopted. A plurality of the above described luminescent or fluorescent display cells 40, for example 6 column x 4 row 24 luminescent or fluorescent display cells, are incorporated in a unit case 41 to form one unit, as shown in Figure 12. Then, a plurality of the above units are arranged in an X Y matrix form, for example 7 column x 5 row 35, to form a block, and five blocks are then arranged laterally to form a sub module. Then, a plurality of the sub modules are combined in an X Y matrix form, for example 9 column x 4 row 36. By using a number of the sub modules, a jumbo size picture display device or tube of, for example, 25 m column x 40 m row is constructed. In this case, the number of the display cells is 36 x 5 x 35 x 24 151,200 and the number of display segments is 3 times the above number and thus is about 450,000. Figures 13A and 13B are, respectively, a front view and a cross sectional view of the whole of a built up jumbo size picture display device. The whole of the jumbo size picture display device is a building or edifice which is, for example, 42m in height and 47m in width. The upper portion of the building is made as a display portion which is provided with 9 floors, each floor having a height of 2.688 m. On each floor there are located 4 sub modules in the lateral direction. Further, on the lower portion of the building there are formed a stage for entertainment, an anteroom, a central control room for operating and managing the display device and the stage, and so on. In the above described way, the picture display device is built. In this case, since 24 luminescent or fluorescent display cells from a unit and a plurality of the units are employed to assembly the whole picture display device, the display device becomes easy to handle and also easy to assemble. In this case, by way of example, each unit is formed to be of a square shape of 40 cm in both height and width. The above described picture display device will now be explained further in connection with the flow of signals therein. Figure 14 is a block diagram showing an example of a video display system in which, as explained hereinbelow, the present invention may be embodied. In this example, video signals from a television camera 101, a video tape recorder VTR 102, a tuner 103 and so on are selected by an input change over switch 104. Each of these video signals is a composite video signal of, for example, the NTSC system. The video signal selected by the switch 104 is supplied to a decoder 105 in which it is decoded into three colour component signals of red, green and blue. These three colour component signals are supplied to respective analog to digital A D converters 106R, 106G and 106B and then converted to respective 8 bit parallel digital signals. These digital signals are supplied alternately to memories 171 171R, 171G, 171B and memories 172 172R, 172G, 172B , each of which has a memory capacity of one field. The memories 171 and 172 each form a scanning converter which provides 4 horizontal lines from 5 horizontal lines. Further, for 189 horizontal lines, for example, selected from each field of the scanning converted signal, one output is derived at every 3 horizontal lines, totalling 63 x 8 bit parallel outputs. In this case, the order to derive the signal from the scanning converter is a specific one such that, after the supply of the signal to one of the units described previously is completed, the supply of the signal to the next neighbouring or adjacent unit will be carried out. That is, as shown in Figure 15, when there are two adjacent units U₁ and U₂, in one field the digital data for a segment corresponding to each cell is derived sequentially from one memory in the numbered order and, after the segment data corresponding to three horizontal lines 201 to 204, 205 to 208 and 209 to 212 in the left hand unit U₁ is derived completely, the segment data corresponding to three horizontal lines 213 to 216, 217 to 220 and 221 to 224 in the right hand unit U₂ is derived. Then, the segment data derivation is shifted successively to the right hand side unit. The segment data corresponding to the horizontal lines marked by the corresponding numbers with prime superscripts in Figure 15 are derived from the other memory in the next field by interlace scanning. This segment data is derived at the same time from the respective memories 171 or 172, respectively. This data derivation is carried out such that 63 items or pieces of data at every 3 lines are derived simultaneously. The data thus derived is supplied to a data selector 108 in which, at every field, the red, green and blue data is selected dot sequentially from the memory in which no writing is carried out, thereby to form the data signal of 63 x 8 bit parallel . The so formed data signal is fed to a multiplexer 109 in which 8 bit parallel signals respectively are converted to serial data signals. The signals thus converted are supplied to an optical converter 110 and then converted thereby to the corresponding optical signal. The optical signals of 63 items of data at every 3 horizontal lines are transmitted through optical fibre cables to centre portions of lateral groups 401,402,... 463 respectively, where each group represents the total units of the display device laterally arranged. Then, for example in the uppermost group 401 of the units, the optical signal from the optical fibre cable 301 is fed to a photo electric converter 111 and converted thereby to the corresponding electrical signal. This converted data signal is supplied to a demultiplexer 112 in which the serial data signal is converted to the 8 bit parallel signal. This parallel data signal is supplied through a bus line 113 to, for example, 100 units 114 The signal from the photo electric converter 111 is further supplied to a sync separator 115 in which synchronising signals are formed by a predetermined pattern generator and so on. The synchronising signals are fed to a timing generator circuit 116 which generates a frame pulse signal FP Figure 16A which is inverted at every field, a unit clock signal UCK Figure 16B which has 255 cycles during a half period 1 field of the frame pulse signal, an element clock signal ECK Figure 16C which contains 38 cycles during two cycles of the unit clock signal UCK, and a start pulse SSP Figure 16D which is formed by one element clock signal amount at every inversion of the frame pulse signal. The frame pulse signal FP, unit clock signal UCK and element clock signal ECK are supplied, together with the above mentioned data signal, through the bus line 113 to the respective units 114 An operation similar to the above is carried out in each of the 63 groups 401,402,...463. Each of the above units includes a signal translating circuit formed as shown in Figure 17. The circuit shown in Figure 17 includes a shift register 121 having 38 stages. The element clock signal ECK supplied from the timing generator circuit 116 through the bus line 113 is supplied to a clock input terminal of the shift register 121 and the start pulse SSP is supplied to a data input terminal of the shift register 121. Then, from the respective stages of the shift register 121, there are delivered sequentially shifted signals S The data signal, as shown in Figure 16F, from the bus line 113 is supplied to all of the elements 201R to 212 B in parallel. The frame pulse signal FP is supplied to the elements 201R to 212B and also is supplied to the elements 201 R to 212 B after being reversed in phase by an inverter 122. The signal S A signal circuit used to drive each element is constructed as shown in Figure 18. In the circuit of Figure 18, an 8 bit latching circuit 131 is supplied at data input terminals thereof with the data signal from the bus line 113. An AND circuit 132 is supplied with the frame pulse signal FP, or its inverted signal, and one of the signals S Accordingly, in each display element of each unit, at the timings of the signals S Further, at the timing of the signal S Since in the next field the frame pulse signal FP is inverted in phase, a similar operation is carried out for the other picture elements of the interlace scanning. At this time, the preset pulse is supplied to the picture or display elements which were driven in the previous field, so that the same display is performed twice on each picture element during the successive 2 field intervals. Thus, display operations are performed on 100 units which are laterally arranged. Further, such display is performed for the 63 vertical direction groups of units in parallel at the same time, whereby a whole picture is displayed. The above described display device includes a drive circuit, constructed as shown in Figure 19, which drives each luminescent display cell. In Figure 19, the red, green and blue PWM signals from the above described PWM signal forming circuit designated 500 in Figure 19 are supplied, respectively, to bases of switching transistors 501R, 501G and 501B. The emitters of the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B are grounded and the collectors thereof are connected through respective resistors 502R, 502G and 502B of high resistive value, for example 100 kilohms, to the first grids G Furthermore, the cathodes K In this circuit, since the voltage from the voltage source 503 of 50V is applied through the resistors 504R, 502R 504G, 502G and 504B, 502B of high resistive value to the first grids G In this case, the cathode current Ik which is proportional to the electron emission , the target current IT which is proportional to the brightness and the grid current IG satisfy a relationship expressed as Ik IG IT. On the other hand, if an open area factor of the grid is taken as η, the cathode current Ik and the grid current IG satisfy a relationship expressed as IG 1 η Ik. Modifying the above equations yields the relationship Thus, the target current which is related to the brightness has a value which is proportional to the grid current. Accordingly, in the above circuit, when the grid currents I In other words, since the resistive values of the resistors 504R, 502R 504G, 502G and 504B, 502B are selected so as to be sufficiently large relative to the equivalent impedance when the cathodes K If one only of each of the resistor pairs 504R, 502R 504G, 502G and 504B, 502B is provided, and has a resistive value of 200 kilohms, the same constant current effect can be achieved. However, if only the resistors 502R, 502G and 502B having a resistive value of 200 kilohms are used, the voltage of 50 V is applied directly to the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B so that it is necessary to increase the withstanding voltage of the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B. On the other hand, if only the resistors 504R, 504G and 504B having a resistive value of 200 kilohms are used, there is a chance that the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B will be destroyed by discharge from the display screen side and so on. Therefore, in order to protect the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B from destruction, it is preferred that a pair of resistors be used as in the example described above. Furthermore, there is a chance that the constant current will be caused to fluctuate by fluctuation of the resistance values of the resistors 502R, 504R 502G, 504G and 502B, 504B. However, this will cause no substantial problem if resistors having a tolerance or error of within about 5 are used. Such resistors are readily available on the market. Thus, a jumbo size picture of 25 m column x 40 m row is displayed. According to the above picture display system, since the data is transmitted sequentially at every unit and, after the data transmission of one display unit is completed, the data of the next neighbouring display unit is transmitted, the display operation is completed at each unit. As a result, the wiring between the respective units need comprise only one line to transmit the start pulse SSP from one unit to the next unit, so that the connections between the units become quite simple. The supply of the data signal and so on from the bus line to each unit can be performed by using a multi contact connector. Therefore, when the units are attached, exchanged or the like, the work involved is simple and the assembly and repair thereof become quite easy. For example, when one unit becomes out of order, it is sufficient for the defective unit to be replaced by a new servicable unit. Since the number of the lines for electrical connection is small, the replacement can be carried out rapidly and easily. Further, a risk that trouble may be caused by contact miss and so on can be reduced. Further, as an emergency measure, it is sufficient for a counter which can count up to 38 to be connected between the input and output terminals for the start pulse of a defective unit and then for this defective unit to be removed. In this case, no adverse effect is exerted on the other units. Furthermore, when the operation of a certain unit itself is checked, since the signal is completed within the unit the check is very easy. Also since the data is transmitted in parallel to every laterally arranged unit, the transmission speed is made low. That is, the data transmission speed in the above example becomes as follows. 60 x 255 x 38 2 290.7 kHz . Further, the data transmission is such that the data of 2 field amounts of the interlace scanning is transmitted in one frame interval and the data is rewritten only once in each picture element at one frame interval. However, the display is repeated in sequential 2 fields and the display frequency is 60 Hz so that the generation of flicker can be suppressed. Further, in the above display device, the first grid current is made to be a constant current so that the brightness characteristics of the phosphor screen can be prevented from fluctuating from one to another. As a result, the brightness of the display screen can be prevented from being irregular and, when the display device is formed as a colour display device, a display of good quality can be achieved without colour irregularity. Since the brightness does not fluctuate, the brightness is made free of adjustment. Accordingly, the adjustment of the whole of the display device can be simplified and installation of the display device and the like can be made easy. However, since the whole video display device as described above generally is located outside i.e. in the open air , the luminescent or fluorescent display cells and so on thereof are exposed to the weather and may be exposed to the direct rays of the sun. For this reason, the luminescent or fluorescent display cells and so on must be positioned with great stability. On the other hand, since the number of the luminescent or fluorescent display cells is enormous, being typically hundreds of thousands, they should be made so that they can be attached to the display device with ease upon manufacture. Further, the display units should be capable of being attached and detached safely and easily for maintenance, inspection and so on. Furthermore, the signals should be supplied to the display units stably and easily. Since the display system is jumbo size, when a certain unit becomes out of order it should be possible to locate the defective unit with ease. Furthermore, since the display system generally is installed at a position higher than those of its viewers, the display should be such as not to be disturbed by the reflection of sunshine and the blue colouring of the sky and so on. Further, since there is a spacing between the adjacent fluorescent display cells because of the structure of the display system, it is necessary to prevent the display from being made discontinuous, particularly in the vertical direction. In addition, due to the structure of the display system, there is a chance that the luminescent or fluorescent display surface will become high in temperature. This suggests the provision of a cooling means which can effectively cool such a luminescent or fluorescent display surface whose temperature becomes high. Various features intended to deal with the technical problems indicated above are disclosed hereinbelow with reference to Figures 20A to 29C of the accompanying drawings. European Patent Application Publication No. EP A 0 080 852 discloses a display system wherein a plurality of display cells are arrayed in an X Y matrix form, means is provided for energising the display cells to display an image, and each of the display cells has at its upper side a member having a reflective surface. The display cells or display areas are arranged in linear arrays of seven within respective elongate display devices which are in turn arrayed to form the display system. Each of the display devices comprising seven display areas is provided with eight of the above mentioned reflective members so that, if the device is arranged in an upright manner, one of the members will be at the upper side of each of the display areas. The eight members are inclined at different precisely predetermined angles to a display surface of the display system. More specifically, the members are arranged in two sets of four, each set being disposed along a respective half of the display device. The two sets of four members are inclined in opposite senses and four members of each set are inclined at respective different angles to the display surface. It appears that one of the two sets of four members has the reflecting surfaces on one side thereof and the other set has the reflecting surfaces on the other side thereof. The object is to magnify the size of each display area so that the total display area of the display device extends to cover end parts of the device having no display areas. According to the present invention there is provided a display system wherein a plurality of display cells are arrayed in an X Y matrix form, means is provided for energising the display cells to display an image, and each of the display cells has at its upper side a member having a reflective surface, characterised in that the means for energising the display cells comprises a signal source for supplying a standard video signal and driving means for supplying the standard video signal to the display cells to cause each of the display cells to display a single dot or element of an image represented by the standard video signal and said members comprise blinds which have black surfaces at their tops and all have their reflective surfaces at their bottoms, the blinds all being inclined at substantially the same angle to a display surface of the display system. As explained in detail below, such a display system minimises the possibility of the display being disturbed by reflections of sunshine and blue sky colouring and so on, and reduces discontinuity of the display, especially in the vertical direction. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like references designate like elements and parts throughout, and in which Figure 1 is a front view of a luminescent or fluorescent display cell that can be used in a display system embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a sectional view taken on a line A A in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional view taken on a line B B in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a partially cut away perspective view of the luminescent or fluorescent display cell of Figure 1 Figure 5 is an enlarged sectional view of a display segment of the display cell Figure 6 is a sectional view illustrative of the operation of a separator of the display cell Figure 7 is a perspective view of the separator Figure 8 is a plan view showing the separator disposed within an envelope Figure 9 is a sectional view of display segments and a portion of the separator Figure 10 is a sectional view showing an example of an alternative wire cathode that can be used in the display cell Figure 11 is a perspective view showing a mounted state of the wire cathode of Figure 10 Figure 12 is a front view of a single unit incorporating a plurality of the display cells Figures 13A and 13B are a front view and a cross sectional view, respectively, of a built up jumbo size display device or system in which the present invention can be embodied Figure 14 is a block diagram of a display system in which the present invention can be embodied Figure 15 is a diagram used for explaining the operation of the display system shown in Figure 14 Figures 16A to 16G are waveform diagrams used for explaining the operation of the display system Figures 17 and 18 are schematic diagrams showing a signal supplying arrangement that can be used in a system embodying the present invention Figure 19 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a drive circuit that can be used for driving each fluorescent display cell of a display system embodying the invention Figure 20A is a rear view showing a display unit used in a display system embodying the present invention, with a back cover of the unit removed Figure 20B is a partially cut away side view of the display unit Figure 20C is a partially cut away base view of the display unit Figure 20D is a front view of the display unit Figure 21 is a rear view showing a mounting structure for unit cases Figures 22A and 22B are front and side views respectively, showing wiring to the display unit Figures 23 and 24 are block diagrams showing examples of fault indicating circuits that can be used in embodiments of the present invention Figure 25 is a cross sectional side view of a display unit that can be used in a display system embodying the present invention Figure 26 is a cross sectional side view of a display sub module that can be used in an embodiment of the present invention Figures 27 and 28 are conceptional diagrams showing cooling systems that can be used in embodiments of the present invention Figure 29A is a front view of a display unit for use in an improved embodiment of the present invention Figure 29B is a cross sectional side view of the display unit shown in Figure 29A and Figure 29C is a partially cut away enlarged view showing a blind portion of the display unit shown in Figure 29A. Ways in which the display system generally as described above can be constructed to form display systems embodying the present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 20A to 29C of the accompanying drawings. Figures 20A to 20D are diagrams showing the structure of a display unit that can be used in a display system embodying the present invention. Figure 20A is a rear view showing the display unit with a back cover thereof removed, Figure 20B is a partially cut away side view thereof, Figure 20C is a partially cut away base view thereof and Figure 20D is a front view thereof. In the display unit shown in Figures 20A to 20D, a case 600 for the display unit comprises a cabinet made of a strong material such as polycarbonate resin containing glass and so on. At the front of the case 600 there are provided 24 windows 601 which are arranged in an X Y matrix form, and at the reverse sides of frames surrounding the windows 601 there are provided protruding portions 602 which are formed in the longitudinal and lateral directions so as to position the fluorescent display cells 40. A fluorescent display cell 40 is provided at each compartment portion partitioned by the protruding portions 602, the display surface of the cell the surface visible in Figure 20D facing the front side of the display system through the window 601. When the fluorescent display cells 40 are attached to the unit case 600, the unit case 600 is placed horizontally with its back facing upwardly and the reverse side surrounding each window 601 is coated with a fluid resin 603 such as silicone rubber and so on. Thereafter, the fluorescent display cell 40 is inserted into the window 601 from the reverse side. A protruding rail 604 which can prevent the fluid resin 603 from flowing into the window 601 is provided around the rear side of the window 601. The coating of the fluid resin 603 is carried out by using a tool employing air pressure. Furthermore, the fluorescent display cell 40 may be provided at its display surface facing the window 601 with a transparent plastic film 605 having a predetermined thickness. Under this state, the resin 603 is heated in, for example, a furnace, so as thereby to be cured. Further, high voltage terminals 12 of the fluorescent display cells 40 are connected sequentially to each other by spot welding or the like through cut out portions not shown formed in the protruding portions 602 at predetermined portions thereof. The fluid resin 603 is once again coated on these welded portions. Under this state, the fluid resin 603 is heated once again in the furnace and cured. In consequence, the fluorescent display cells 40 can be attached to the unit case 600 easily end positively. After being cured, the silicone resin 603 is of excellent quality as regards electrical insulation, water tightness, heat radiation and heat resistance. Further, the high voltage terminal 12 of each cell 40 is insulated satisfactorily. Furthermore, by virtue of the transparent plastic film 605, the display surface of each fluorescent display cell 40, which becomes high in temperature upon display, is protected against direct contact from raindrops and, therefore, there is little or no fear that the display surface of the cell 40 will be broken by rapid cooling. A back cover 606 is attached to the reverse side of the unit case 600 with its junction being made proof against water by a sealing member 607 such as of rubber and so on. Bolts 608 are inserted in protruding portions of the back cover 606 to enable the unit case 600 to be attached to a structure forming a sub module either directly or via an adaptor which will be described later. Figure 21 is a rear view showing the unit case 600 attached to the structure. In this case, steel frames 701 are provided at a predetermined spacing, a display unit being attached directly to every other steel frame 701 and a display unit disposed between adjacent steel frames 701 being attached to the steel frames 701 via an adaptor 702 which is nearly of H shape. Accordingly, with this display system, when the adaptor 702 is removed from the steel frame 701, a central unit 600a that mounted between two steel frames can be removed. Further, when the central display unit 600a has been removed, it is possible to remove the display units 600b and 600c that are attached directly to the steel frames 701 at both sides thereof. Thus, each display unit 600 can be attached stably and removed with great ease for maintenance, inspection and so on. Inside the cabinet formed by the back cover 606 and the unit case 600, circuit boards 611 and 612 are mounted to the side of the unit case 600 by leg portions 609 and 610. A signal processing circuit is provided on the rear side of the circuit board 612, while a driving circuit for driving the fluorescent display cells 40 is provided on the front side of the circuit board 611. Further, as shown in Figure 22, the circuit board 612 is disposed so that its rear side faces the inner surface of the back cover 606, and receptacles 613 and 614 for use in supplying signals to the circuit board 612 are exposed to the rear side of the back cover 606 through openings formed therethrough. Further, a protective case 619 having an opening at the bottom thereof is provided around an opening of the back cover 606. The receptacles 613 and 614 are connected, respectively, to outside connectors 617 and 618 that are connected to signal cables 615 and 616. Accordingly, in this display system, the signal cables 615 and 616 are connected to each unit with great ease. Since the protective case 619 is provided around the opening of the back cover 616, the connected portion can be protected from raindrops, dust and the like and is large in mechanical strength relative to an external impact, thus reducing a risk that it will be broken and so on. Consequently, it is not necessary to use an expensive connector such as a Canon connector, whereby a stable connection can be established by using receptacles and connectors as used for general electronic apparatus. The water proof property water tightness of the above portion can be increased by covering the back cover 606 around its opening by a sealing member such as of rubber and the like, providing the protective case 619 with a lid which allows passage therethrough only of the signal cable, or covering the whole of the protective case 619 with a water proof bag, and so on. Fault indicating light emitting devices 620R, 620G and 620B are provided at peripheral portions of the receptacles 613 and 614. The light emitting devices 620R to 620B may be made luminous by supplying all signals of a PWM pulse width modulated signal forming circuit 500 to a NOR circuit 621 as, for example, shown in Figure 23, or by supplying independently three red, green and blue primary colour signals of R, G and B to NOR circuits 621R, 621G and 621B, respectively, and from there to respective light emitting diodes 620R, 620G and 620B, as shown in Figure 24. The PWM signal forming circuit 500 in each of Figures 23 and 24 form the PWM signals from input signals applied to the left hand side thereof and passes these signals to the cells 40 via a driver circuit 501 . Accordingly, in this display system, when a picture image that is thoroughly white in colour is displayed, the output signals of the PWM signal forming circuit 500 all become low in level so that, if the display system is in a normal operational mode, the input signals to the NOR circuits 621R, 621G and 621B all become low in level, whereby the light emitting devices 620R to 620B are operated to emit light. On the other hand, if any one cell is not operating correctly, the light emitting devices 620R to 620B are stopped from emitting light. In consequence, from the reverse side of the display system, an operator can detect a unit whose light emitting devices 620R to 620B have stopped emitting light and then can carry out replacement, repair and so on of the corresponding unit, etc. When the red, green and blue colour signals are detected, respectively, by the light emitting devices 620R to 620B, if, for example, only the light emitting device 620B has stopped emitting light, the corresponding unit may not always be repaired. If in the above described example the PWM signal forming circuit 500 is not operating correctly and if a fault in the fluorescent display cell 40 is to be detected, such detection can be carried out as follows. If the picture screen is monitored by a television TV camera located at a long distance from the display device, and when a fault is found in a unit, the display on the picture screen is erased and a video signal of a cross shaped cursor with the width of each unit at the crossing point of the longitudinal and lateral directions is formed and then displayed. Thus, at the reverse side of the unit, the unit whose light emitting devices 620R to 620B are rendered luminous is searched in the lateral direction. If a unit at the crossing point of the upper and lower units whose light emitting devices 620R to 620B are rendered luminous is discovered, such discovered unit becomes the crossing point of the cursor, i.e. it is the unit having the fault. Further, in the unit case 600 shown in Figure 20, blinds 622 are provided on the windows 601 at the upper sides thereof and on the front sides, as shown in Figure 25. Each blind 622 has a black surface at the top thereof and a mirror or reflecting surface 623 at the bottom thereof. Accordingly, in this display system, if a light ray S from the sun, a blue sky coloration and so on are incident on the display surface of a display cell 40, these light rays are shielded by the blind 622 and do not reach and are not reflected by the display surface of the display cell 40, whereby the display is prevented from being disturbed. Also, displays As described above, the present display system is formed of a plurality of sub modules, which are installed in a building so as to assemble the display system. In this case, as shown in Figure 26, each sub module has a space of a predetermined width at the rear side thereof in which a high voltage supply circuit 703 and so on are formed and a path 704 for operators is secured. Furthermore, in the front side of the sub module, the unit case 600 is attached to a steel frame 702 to thereby provide a space between the adjacent unit cases 600, while at the reverse side thereof the floor, ceiling and the rear surface thereof are nearly tightly closed by a wall 705. At a predetermined portion of the reverse side of the wall 705, there is formed an opening in which a cooling fan 706 is provided. The cooling fan 706 is driven to cause air to flow into the sub module, thereby to raise the air pressure inside of the sub module surrounded by the wall 705. Then, the air under high pressure flows through the spaces between the adjacent unit cases 600. Thus, a convection flow pattern shown by arrows in Figure 27 top view is generated so that the display surface of each display cell 40 is cooled by a flow of air. When the sub modules which may weigh around 10 tonnes each are attached to posts or frames 800 of the building as, for example, shown in Figure 28, it is enough for the cooling fans 706 to be provided at two places between adjacent frames 800. Figures 29A to 29C show a display unit for use in an improved display system embodying the present invention. In the display unit of Figures 29A to 29C, at a central portion in the front of the unit case 600, there is provided a strip like grounding plate 651 extending in the vertical direction. A stainless steel plate which forms the reflecting surface 623 of each blind 622 is connected electrically to the grounding plate 651 by a bolt 652a. Both ends of the grounding plate 651 are electrically connected to one end of a metal conductor or nut 653 by bolts 652b and, further, the other end of each metal conductor 653 is connected to the back cover 606 of the unit case 600 by a bolt 652c. The back cover 606 is generally made of metal and is attached by bolts 608 to the steel frame and so will construct the sub module. Consequently, according to this display system, the conductive reflecting surface 623 is grounded by the steel frame and the like which form the submodule through the bolt 652a, the grounding plate 651, the bolt 652b, the metal conductor 653, the bolt 652c and the back cover 606. The reflecting surface 623 and the grounding plate 651 may in practice be arranged as shown, for example, in Figure 29C, in which at the portion at which the stripe grounding plate 651 is disposed, the blind 622 is cut away as shown by a broken line. As described above, the conductive reflecting surface 623 is grounded and accordingly, in the display system as shown in Figure 29, the reflecting surface 623 is prevented from being electrified. Since atmospherics and lightning discharges are grounded, there is no risk or at least a reduced risk of the circuits and so on within the display system being damaged or broken. Further, since the conductive reflecting surface 623 that is grounded has a shielding effect, this can prevent undesired radiation. In Figures 29A to 29C, it is not always necessary to effect the connections provided by the bolts 652a, 652b and 652c by screwing it is sufficient to ensure electrical connections between them. The grounding plate 651 need not necessarily be in the shape of a strip, but may be a plate shaped conductor, a braided wire and the like. In addition, if a strip shaped grounding plate 651 is used and it is in the form of a rigid body, it can serve as a reinforcement of the unit case 600. As set forth above, embodiments of the present invention enable a display of high quality to be made by a display system of simple construction. Further, according to the improved embodiment of this invention, since the reflecting surface is grounded, the reflecting surface can be prevented from being electrified. Furthermore, since atmospherics and lightning discharges are grounded, there is no risk or little risk that the circuits and the like inside the display system will be damaged or broken. In addition, undesired radiation can be shielded. The invention can, of course, be embodied in other ways than those described above by way of example. For instance, the invention is applicable not only to a video signal display system as described above, but also to any signal display system where a plurality of display cells are arranged in an X Y matrix form.
