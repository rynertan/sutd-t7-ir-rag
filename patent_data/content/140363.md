# PHASED ARRAY TRANSDUCER CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a phased array ultrasound transducer, and the transducer manufactured by the inven tive method are described. In the method, a piezoelectric crystal is soldered to the edges of a pair of double sided printed circuit boards, each of which has traces on either side. Then, a backing material is poured to secure the crystal and boards, and a saw is used to define the elements of the transducer.
