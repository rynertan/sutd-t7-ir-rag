# Hot melt sizing applying.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method effect application of molten size to textile yarns, such as spun yarns. An applicator cy linder is rotatable about a horizontal axis and has a number of grooves circumferentially formed in its surface, with peaked lands between the grooves, each land making an angle of about 8 12 with respect to a plane bridging the top of an associated groove. A furnisher roll, also rotatable about a horizontal axis, picks up molten size from an open top through and delivers it to grooves in the rotating appli cator cylinder. The surface of the furnisher roll cooperates with that of the applicator cylinder so that sloping areas of the furnisher roll mate with the lands of the applicator cy linder and so that flat areas of the furnisher roll bridge the entrances to the grooves. The furnisher roll may be of poly tetrafluoroethylene machined to correspond to the surface of the applicator cylinder, or may have an elastomeric material surface. A cleaning device comprises a pad, which may be a thermoplastic polymeric material capable of lengthy exposure to high temperatures, having a surface corresponding essentially identically to the surface of the applicator cylinder, and mounted so that it is pressed into engagement with the applicator cylinder to remove molten size and contaminants from the grooves of the applicator cylinder. The molten size with contaminants is diverted by the cleaner to a filter, which removes lint from the size and returns it to the trough.
