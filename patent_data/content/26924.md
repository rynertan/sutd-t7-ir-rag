# Adaptive cross polarization interference cancellation arrangements.

## Abstract
A desired polarized signal 102 and an intertering or thogonally polarized signal 104 , including cross polariza tion components, are concurrently received at an antenna 100 . In the present arrangement, the orthogonally polariz ed components of the received signal are separated 105 and transmitted along separate paths 106, 107 and re combined 110 after the phase and amplitude of the se parated polarized interfering signal sample has been ap propriately adjusted 114 for maximally canceling cross polarization components thereof in the other path. A feed back path includes circuitry 120, 123, 124 for obtaining a sample of any remaining interfering signal in the recombin ed output signal, generating a signal representative of the power envelope of such sample, and then generating ap propriate control signals 126, 127 in response to such re presentative power envelope signal to provide improved adjustment of the amplitude and phase of the separated polarized interfering signal sample.
