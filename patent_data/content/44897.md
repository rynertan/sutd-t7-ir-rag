# Improvements in liquid proportioning devices.

## Abstract
The invention refers to improvements in liquid pro portioning devices. A tank 6 of filling fluid under pressure feeds a filling liquid collector 1 . Fluid coming from said collector 1 shifts the sliding plunger 7 without shank of a dual action proportioning cylinder 2 provided at each of its ends with an inlet outlet hole 8 for the liquid. A distributor valve 9 , of the four way L type alternatively communicates in each cycle each the collector 1 and at least one bottle filling nozzle 12 with one of said holes 8 of the cylinder 2 through ducts 3, 4, 10, 11 .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Improvements in liquid proportioning devices, particularly applicable to bottle filling machines, of the type which include a filling liquid collector 1 , a proportioning cylinder 2 , a first duct 3 , through which the liquid leaves the collector 1 and a second duct 4 , through which the liquid reaches the bottle filling nozzle 12 , characterized in that a pressure higher than the atmosphere is applied to the liquid contained in the collector 1 , which causes the shifting of a sliding plunger 7 without a shank with which the cylinder 2 is provided, with dual effect, there being an inlet and or outlet hole 8 for the liquid at each end of the said cylinder 2 , and the assembly incorporating a distributor valve 9 , preferably of the four wayL type, which is connected to the said first 3 and second 4 ducts and to a third 10 and fourth 11 ducts, respectively connected to the inlet and or outlet holes 8 of the cylinder 2 , all so that the valve 9 alternatively communicates in each cycle, each of the said first 3 and second 4 ducts with one of the said third 10 and fourth 11 ducts. 2. Improvements according to claim 1, characterized in that the cylinder 2 is provided in at least one of its ends with a proportioning setting device, advantageously made up of a screw 14 coaxial to the cylinder 2 , with its free end 15 inserted in the latter and which can be shifted axially by screwing or unscrewing in a threaded axial hole of the cylinder head 19 , this free end 15 of the screw 14 limiting the position of a closing part 20 , which in turn limits the stroke of the sliding plunger 7 and, consequently, regulating the volume of liquid proportioned by the cylinder 2. 3. Improvements according to claim 1, characterized in that the said second duct 4 can be bifurcated into a fifth 16 and sixth 7 supply ducts of two filling nozzles 12 , with a distributor 18 , in itself known, being arranged in the bifurcation, preferably of the three ways type, which alternatively communicates in each cycle the said second duct 4 with each of the said fifth 16 and sixth 17 ducts.

## Description
Improvements in liquid proportioning devices. The present invention refers to improvements in liquid proportioning devices, particularly applicable to bottle filling machines ot the type which include a filling liquid collector, a proportioning cylinder, a first duct, through which the liquid leaves the collector, and a second duct, through which the liquid reaches the bottle tilling nozzle. Known proportioning devices of this type present the drawback that possible air inputs reduce the accuracy of the proportioned distribution of liquid into the bottle filling nozzle. One aim of the invention is to propose improvements to known proportioning devices of this type, so that this drawback can be suppressed. In essence, the improvements concerned are characterized in that a pressure higher than the atmosphere, is applied to the liquid contained in the collector, which brings about the shifting of a sliding plunger with no shank, which the cylinder is provided with, with dual effect at each end of the said cylinder there is an inlet outlet hole for the liquid and a distributor valve is added to the assembly, preferably of the 4 way L type, which is connected to the first and second ducts and to a third and fourth ducts, respectively connected to the input and or output holes or the cylinder, all so that the valve alternatively communicates in each cycle each of the said first and second ducts with one of the said third and fourth ducts. Other characteristics and advantages of the improvements object of the present invention will be gathered from the following description made in relation to the annexed drawings which illustrate a form of embodiment of same, by way of unlimiting example. Fig. 1 illustrates a diagrammatic view of a liquid proportioning device according to the invention, in which the second duct, through which the liquid reaches the bottle filling nozzle, leads to a single filling nozzle and Fig. 2 is a similar view to Fig. 1, but with a second bifurcated duct, which feeds two filling nozzles. According to these drawings,it can be sem that the filling machines to which the im,nrovements according to the present invention are applied, include a collector of the filling liquid 1, a proportioning cylinder 2, a first duct 3, through which the liquid leaves the collector 1, and a second duct 4, through which the liquid reaches the filling nozzle or nozzles 12 of the bottles 13. The filling liquid is at a super atmospheric pressure produced by a pump 5 delivering the liquid to the tank 6 in which it is stored under pressure. The filling liquid itself shifts a sliding plunger 7 without shank with which the cylinder 2 of the dual effect type is provided there being an inlet and or outlet hole 8 for the liquid at each end of the said cylinder 2. The assembly has incorporated therei a distributor valve 9 preferably of the four way L type, connected to the said first and second ducts 3 and 4 and to a third and fourth ducts 10 and 11, respectively connected to the holes 8 of the cylinder 2. In this arrangement, the valve 9 alternatively communicates in each cycle each of the said first and second ducts 3 and 4 with one of the said third and fourth ducts 10 and 11. The cylinder 2 is provided in at least one of its ends with a proportioning setting device, advantageously made up of a screw 14 coaxial to the cylinder 2, withies f rebe end 15 inserted in the cylinder 2 and capable of being axially shifted through screwing or unscrewing in a threaded axial hole of the head 19 of the cylinder 2, this free end of the screw 14 limiting the position of the closing part 20 which in turn limits the stroke of the sliding plunger 7 and, consequently, regulating the volume of the liquid proportioned by the cvlinder 2. As seen in figure 2, the second duct 4 can be bifurcated into a fifth and a sixth supply ducts 16 and 17, with two filling nozzles 12, there being a distributor 18, known in itself, in the bifurcation, preferably of the three way type, which alternatively communicates in each cycle the said duct 4 with each of the aforementioned fifth and sixth ducts 16 and 17. Compared with known proportioning devices, those incorporating the improvements disclosed in the present invention offer important advantages, among which not only there is no possibility of air inputs, which enables greater proportioning accuracy, but also advantage is taken of both strokes of the plunger of the dual action proportioning cylinder thereby achieving double performance. After having disclosed the nature of the invention, as well as the way of putting it into practice, it is stated that whatever does not alter, change or modify its basic principle, can be subject to variation in detail.
