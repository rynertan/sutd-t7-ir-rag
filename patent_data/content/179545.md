## Description
Aqueous quenching media containing oxazoline polymers and a process for quenching metals using them This invention relates to the heat treatment of metals, and more particularly to a novel process for quenching metals. In order to modify the physical properties of metals and their alloys, various methods of heat treatment have been devised in which the metal is heated to a given elevated temperature and then cooled.Generally the cooling takes place at a relatively rapid rate, and such cooling is commonly referred to as quenching . Quenching is accomplished by immersing the hot metal in a liquid bath, usually water or oil. Water alone produces very rapid cooling and is not suitable for quenching many types of steel, for it produces excessive strains which warp and crack the steel. Hydrocarbon oils provide a relatively slow rate of cooling which is desired to produce certain physical properties, such as ductility, in steel. However, the slower cooling rate provided by oil quenching, although it prevents excessive strains in the metal, often prevents development of the desired hardness. It, therefore, is desirable to provide quench liquids which will cool the metal at rates similar to oil, or intermediate between oil and water, while achieving the greatest degree of hardness without warping or cracking the steel. To this end various aqueous solutions and dispersions of organic compounds have been proposed as quenching fluids, Such aqueous solutions and dispersions approach the quenching properties of oil, but without the disadvantages of the fire, smoke and fumes associated with the use of oil. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,220,893 discloses a liquid quenching medium comprising an aqueous solution of a liquid oxyalkylene polymer having both oxyethylene and higher oxyalkylene groups and a molecular weight of 12,000 to 14,000. Such compounds are also referred to as polyether polyols and poly oxyethylene oxyalkylene glycols. According to the patent, the oxyalkylene polymers have the characteristic of decreasing in solubility as the temperature of the quenching bath is increased, as when red hot metal is introduced therein. The oxyalkylene polymers are said to form a covering. over the metal surface to the exclusion of the water component of the bath.The polymer layer is said to be an excellent heat conducting medium which operates at a high rate, and thus use thereof requires relatively short quench cycle time, which results in minimum internal stress and distortion of the metal, while at the same time imparting uniform hardenability of the metal. Such nonionic oxyalkylene polymer quenchants control cooling rate of the metal not only by such inverse solubility with temperature, but also by increasing the viscosity of the water in which they are dissolved. Accordingly, it has been the practice to use large amounts of polymer, e.g. 10 to 15t by weight. In use, such relatively concentrated baths suffer from the disadvantage of drag out , i.e. the polymer is removed with the metal being quenched resulting in undesirable changes in bath viscosity and the necessity for treatment of resulting effluent from washing of the quenched metal to remove adhering polymer. Very high molecular weight nonionic polyoxyalkylene glycols can be used, but the increase in viscositythey cause makes them impractical. It has been suggested to increase the quench cycle time by use of organic compounds which cause the formation of a vapor blanket about the metal during the quenching operation. An example of such an organic compound is a water soluble polyacrylate, such as sodium polyacrylate, the use of which compound in a quenching bath comprises the subject matter of U.S. Patent No. 4,087,290. Quenching of metal using as the quenching medium an aqueous solution of a water soluble polymer of a C2 C4 olefin having a heterocyclic side group composed of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen is suggested in U.S.Patent No. 3,902,929. In our copending European patent applicationNo. 84902257.9 Publication No. 149623 oorresponding to WO 84 04545 which forms part of the state of the art solely by virtue of Article 54 3 EPC there is disclosed a quenching process employing a quenching bath comprising an aqueous solution containing an effective cooling rate reducing amount of a nonionic water soluble or water dispersible substituted oxazoline polymer having recurring units of the general formulaEMI3.1 where R is an organic radical which does not significantly alter the nonionic and water solubility and waterdispersibility characteristics of the polymer when said polymer is present in said concentrations, the units being present in an amount to provide the polymer with a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 1,000,000, for example polyethyloxazoline.Such a polymer is capable of providing quenching effects similar to those produced by oil quenchants, as well as quenching times between those provided by oil and water. An object of thi s invention is to provide a novel metal quenching process employing a quenching bath which can be varied in composition to provide a broad range of quenching rates from that of oil toward that of water. Another object of this invention is the provision of novel quenching baths which provide for slower quenching rates at the temperature where martensite transformation starts resulting in improved physical properties in the quenched metal. A further object of the present invention is to provide novel quenching baths which provide cooling rates comparable with those based on aqueous solutions or dispersions of substituted polyoxazolines, but using reduced amounts of such compounds and consequently providing reduced costs. Still another object of this invention is the provision of concentrates which can be diluted with water to form quenching baths of reduced quenching rates. These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings, Figs. I to VIII of which are cooling, rate curves at 700 F 371 C for various quenching baths, including those of the present invention, and the following examples, which are included for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. According to this invention there are provided novel quenching baths and quenching processes using such baths in the heat treatment of metals. More particularly the baths comprise a mixture of a a water soluble or water dispersible, nonionic, substituted polyoxazoline and b a water soluble or water dispersible polymer or copolymer of a C2 C4 olefin having a heterocyclic side group composed of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, sometimes referred to herein as an N vinyl heterocyclic polymer or copolymer. The water soluble or water dispersible, nonionic substituted oxazoline polymers have recurring units of the formulaEMI5.1 where R is an organic radical which does not significantly decrease the water solubility or water dispersibility or nonionic character of the polymer. Usually R will be a substituent selected from the group consisting of a phenyl group or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms which may be halogen substituted, although R is not necessarily limited to such groups, and n is an integer such as to provide said polymers with a molecular weight of from about 5000 to about 1,000,000, preferably 50,000 to 500,000. The substituent R in at least about 50 percent of said units in said polymers should be alkyl containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms.Particularly preferred baths according to the invention contain an alkyloxazoline polymer having a molecular weight of from about 200,000 to about 500,000, and in which the alkyl group R contains from 2 to 3 carbon atoms. The water soluble or water dispersible homopolymers of N vinyl heterocyclics have the general formula EMI6.1 where R is ethylene, propylene or butylene, and x is an interger such as to provide the polymers with a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000.Preferably, the molecular weight is in the range of from about 50,000 to 360,000, polymers having a molecular weight in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 being particularly preferred. Copolymers of N vinyl heterocyclics may also be used in the quenching baths and process of this invention. Typical of such compounds are the copolymers of N vinyl pyrrolidone with such co monomers as styrene, vinyl acetate, methacrylates such as dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate, and maleic anhydride.The last named copolymers have recurring units of the formula EMI7.1 where R is hydrogen or a metal ion, such as an alkali metal ion, or a salt forming ammonium or amino group, and y is an integer. The molecular weights of such copolymers shoud be similar to those of the homopolymers. Preferably constituent b is an N vinyl pyrrolidone polymer having a molecular weight of from about 5000 to about 400,000. It was discovered that in an aqueous quenching bath containing substituted polyoxazoline constituent a , a substantial portion of said component could be replaced by the N vinyl heterocyclic compound b without any significant increase in cooling rate.More particularly, it was discovered that at bath concentrations of constituent a in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3.0 , by weight, up to three forths thereof could be replaced by the less expensive, commercially available N vinyl heterocyclic compound and slow cooling rates could still be retained. The reason why such advantageous result is obtained is not fully understood, but possibly it is due to some thickening effect provided by the N vinyl heterocyclic compound. Apparently the quenching baths of this invention, like those based entirely on substituted oxazoline polymers, exhibit a relatively short vapor phase similar to oil quenchants and also an extended convection stage which is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Thus, the quenching baths of this invention find utility where other aqueous baths containing polymers are unsatisfactory. Of particular importance is the discovery that in the novel quenching baths of this invention, replacement of from about 10 to about 90 , by weight, preferably about 25 to about 75S, of the oxazoline polymer with the N vinyl heterocyclic polymer or copolymer, provides substantially slower cooling rates in the martensite region in quenching of steel, such rate being slower than that to be expected based on cooling rates for the individual constituents a and b . Such slowing of the cooling rate in thisregion is most important in order to reduce and even eliminate the possibility of undesirable cracking and distortion of the quenched metal. The following examples more fully describe the quenching process of this invention, but are not to be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the invention.Test Procedures In each test where cooling time was determined, the test specimen was a cylinder 500 millimeters long and 10 millimeters in diameter, and composed of scaleproof austenitic steel. A microthermocouple was inserted into the center of the cylinder, and the temperature representing output of the thermocouple was recorded by means of a plotter Bascom Turner which simultaneously recorded specimen temperature vs. time and cooling rate vs. specimen temperature. The test specimen was heated in an electric resistance furnace which was operated without a controlled atmosphere and adjusted to a temperature of about 17000F. 925 C. . In each test, the test specimen at the time of immersion in the quenchant was 16200F. 8490C. . The quantity of quenchant used was 0.5 liters, and the temperature of the quenchant was 800F. 27or. . Cooling curves were obtained using the above test conditions with aqueous quenching baths of various compositions. Cooling times during which the test specimens were cooled from 16000F. 8710C. to 4000F. 2040C. were determined from the cooling curves.Cooling rate at 7000F 3710C. was determined from the cooling rate curves. The results obtained are described hereinbelow.Example I Eighteen quenching baths were prepared. Six baths comprised aqueous solutions of polyethyloxazoline having a molecular weight of 500,000, the concentrations of the baths being 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.0 , by weight. The second series of six baths contained polyvinylpyrrolidone, the concentrations in the respective baths being the same as those for the baths containing polyethyloxazoline. The third series of baths contained a mixture of equal parts by weight of polyethyloxazoline and polyvinylpyrrolidone, the concentrations of the mixtures being the same as for the other twelve baths. Cooling times for the several baths were determined using the procedure hereinabove described.The data obtained as a result of such tests are set forth in Table I, below Table I Cooling Time Sec.

Component a was polyethyloxazoline POE having a M.W. of 500,000 and component b was polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP having aM.W. of 360,000. Using these quenching baths, cooling curves were obtained using the above described procedure.The results obtained are set forth in Table II, below Table IIComponent POE PVP Cooling Time Sec.POE 100 0 8.0PVP 0 100 4.2POE PVP 75 25 10.6POE PVP 50 50 9.8POE PVP 25 75 The data in Table II show that the greatest effect in slowing cooling rate was obtained when 25 of the polyethyloxazoline was replaced by the polyvinylpyrrolidone. From Tables I and II it can be seen that polyvinylpyrrolidone nearly always provides faster lower number of seconds cooling rates than polyethyloxazoline alone or the combination of POE andPVP.Example III The purpose of this example was to determine the cooling rate for various quenching baths at that temperature, approximately 7000F 3710C. at which some martensite transformation in steel starts Ms . In each experiment, the quenching bath contained a combined total for constituents a and b of 1 or 2s. Some baths contained only oxazoline polymer PEO , while others contained only polyvinylprrolidone PVP . In addition, there were baths containing 75, 50 and 25 of polyoxazoline, and 25, 50 and 75f, respectively, of polyvinylpyrrolidone. The oxazoline polymer used had a molecular weight of either 200,000 or 500,000 whereas, the molecualr weight of the polyvinylpyrrolidone was 40,000 160,000 or 360,000. The procedure used has been described previously and the results obtained are set forth inFigures I to VII, inclusive. In the several figures, the total concentration of PVP and PEO combined, and the molecular weights of the respective polymers were as set forth in Table III, below TABLE IIIFigure Total Concentration M.W.

I to VIII show that using various quenching baths according to this invention containing both a substituted polyoxazoline and a polymer or copolymer of N vinylpyrrolidone, slower cooling rates than those obtained by either POE or PVP alone, are obtained. The effect changes with the ratio of POE toPVP, concentration and molecular weight of the respective polymers used. Such synergistic effect was not predictable based in the cooling rates provided by the individual components a and b . Thus, as stated previously, an economic advantage is to be obtained using the novel quenching baths of the present invention for a portion of the more expensive POE can be replaced by PVP, yet slower cooling rates than those provided byPOE alone are obtained. As indicated previously, this invention also contemplates concentrates from which the novel quenching baths of this invention can be prepared merely by addition of water. Such concentrates are aqueous compositions containing at least a combined total of 5 , by weight, of components a and b , and may contain a total of such components up to the solubility limit thereof which may be as high as 60 to 70 . Ordinarily such concentrates will contain a combined total of from about 5 to about 10t of components a and b .
