# Inertial rotoaccumulator system.

## Abstract
An inertial rotoaccumulator system utilises a flywheel which is run up to speed during vehicle braking and allowed to contribute energy during subsequent acceleration through the intermediary of an infinite ratio continuously variable planetary drive arrangement. This drive arrangement has a main shaft A and a flywheel shaft B . Another shaft B2 is rotatable on the flywheel shaft. Continuously variable ratio belt type drives link compound planet pulleys C1, C2 on the main shaft to pulleys B1_1, and B1_2 on the flywheel shaft and the other shaft and a further continuously variable ratio belt type drive means B2_2, B2_1, D1, D2 links together the flywheel shaft and the other shaft, to enable the ratio to be set so that the flywheel shaft can rotate freely without any motion being transmitted back to the main shaft during intervals when it is required to store energy in the flywheel.

## Description
INERTIA ROTOACCEATOR SYSTDI In land vehicles automobiles, railways , the fraction of the energy consumed corresponding to the loss due to braking during which the kinetic energy of the verwicle is converted to heat is very variable, moreso when the stoppages are frequent, such as during congested traffic, but hardly ever negligible. However, the most important effect of the series of brakings and new accelerations on the energetic consumption is not due to the direct dissipation of heat, but due to the conditions imposed by this system on the engine power. Especially in motor cars, the maximum engine power is, moreso, associated with the acceleration pick up which it can proportion, than with the road speed.Although this maximum power only intervenes when starting and going up steep hills, the consumption has a low limit which cannot be lowered even in uniform and horizontal motion, in spite of the fact an an engine having a low power and consumption would be sufficient in this case to maintain the speed. One way of restoring a portion of the kinetic energy of the vehicle is to use electric driving. The engines are converted to generators during braking, returning energy to the power station in case of a trolley, electric train , or to batteries in the vehicle itself if it functions by means thereof or if it has an electrogenous group. This sytem presents the disadvantage that it does not permit high accelerations as normally required by automobiles , since the electric motors are hardly temperamental , that is, they are not suit able for significant and sudden changes of energy. The main idea inspired by the inertial rotoaccumulator is that of freeing the motor from the responsibility of the sudden and short changes of energy, required by the system to which the vehicle should be subjected. The engine should only supply the average power for sufficiently long periods of time for example of one minute so that any system is capable of adapting its power with optimum performance possibility of using for example external combustion engines, the Stirling engine, etc. . naturally, energy should be stored during braking which is returned to the following acceleration, without using a dual drive system and without the intervention of a generator or accumulator electric motor system, since it is unfit for sudden acceleration and braking. The simplest course of action is to convert the motion kinetic energy of the vehicle to rotational kinetic energy of an accumulator flywheel, utilizing therefor purely mechanical means. Therefore, the wheels should be connected to said flywheel through a continuous speed ratio changing system braking will consist in displacing said ratio towards the wheel which should be able to rotate l idly t with a minimum friction while acceleration will be produced by the inverse displace ment This system of the invention, of special interest due to the energetic and ecological crisis, is mole advantageous than the saving in energy due to the recovery of braking, viz a Energetic saving al. Restoring when braking a2. Designing with low powered engines a Perfection of the fuel due to the equili brium of the engine b Possibility of using low quality fuels, easier to burn in external combustion engines c Possibility of consuming electric energy using accumulators. This type of driving is facilitated both by the energetic saving and by the liberation of the engine of sudden changes of energy. The kinetic energy accumulator flywheel can be made to coincide with the armature of the motor, with the consequent reduction in weight and costs. Referring to the energetic saving due to restoring when braking, this would be of special importance in the case of high speed passenger trains which make frequent stops, since it is possible to reduce the frictions and, therefore, the average power, but an elevated power is required when starting and braking. With the present distribution between the forms of primary energy overwhelming predominance of fossil fuels , the electric drive of vehicles is an energetic absurdity, since the fuels are burnt to produce energy, which moves generators, to transmit the energy at a distance, store it with high losses , and convert it again to mechanical energy. The situation will differ when in the future, due to present day technology, an increasing portion of the primary energy should be converted mainly to electrical energy. This occurs with nuclear, whether fission or fusion, hydraulic, eolic, tidal and solar photovoltaic or thermic at high temperature energy. In any ase, the electric vehicle is justified for non contaminating reasons and in reserved areas. d Contaminationzeduction due to the balanced system of combustion engines, or to the electric drive. The idea of a continuous purely mechanical change of speeds, presents various difficulties a the simplest and known way of making a continuous change, that is, by pulleys formed of two conical pieces having a variable separation, is in principle hardly suitable to transmit elevated energies. This process is used in the Variomatik change of the Dutch patent. b The interval multiplicative between the maximum and the minimum speed ratios is not sufficiently long. c In any case, the lowest point of this interval cannot be zero or infinite, depending on the proportion . That is to say, it is not possible with cone pulleys, to continuously reach a position at which one of them is at rest while the other is still rotating. This latter difficulty merits special comments. From an energetic point of view, the fact that the kinetic energy corresponding to a residual speed of,for example,the fifth part of the initial speed is lost, is not too important, since this means that 24 25 of the kinetic energy existing before applying the brakes has been restored. In theory, it would be possible to connect the flywheel to the wheels or the transmission shaft through pulleys, and to reduce the speed of the vehicle by storing energy in the flywheel until a minimum from which the flywheel should be 1disengaged11 and a conventional braking system should act. Although this is energetically feasible, it is bulky and, therefore, hardly safe. Therefore, one of the features characterising the inertial rotoaccumulator resides in that with a single mechanism the complete range of speeds until the vehicle is stopped, is covered. To achieve this, a continuous change speed ratio planetary having an infinite range, known as infinite range planetary, is used, which constitutes the main novel feature of the inertial rotoaccumulator, capable of converting continuous change speed ratio range, achieved by any system for example by cone pulleys having a variable separation to another, one of whose extremes is the zero ratio if the maximum ratio is divided by the minimum, it is infinite, and hence the denomi nation . Difficulties b and c are overcome in this way. Deferring to difficulty a , which can be rover come since it is a question of dimensioning, it is pos sible to join the pulleys by chains instead of belts, designed to resist high stresses with low friction. The planetary has a characteristic which should be pointed out before describing the features of the invention The possibility of reducing one of the two speeds to zero is associated with the fact that the energy moving between its part is greater than that entering and leaving the assembly, the proportion thereof being higher the more the low speed approaches zero. Since the frictional power will be an approximately constant fraction of the sums of the powers of its various parts, when the speed tends to zero the performance of the planetary will also tend to zero, that is, the fraction of energy given off by the vehicle which does not reach the flywheel will tend to 100ss. According to this, the planetary does not excel, from an energetic point of view, the mixed system mentioned above continuous change to a minimum speed, after braking with dissipation of heat , but its main advantage is its uniqueness and simplicity and, therefore, its safety. In any case, it is convenient to reduce to a maximum the frictions The planetary is, therefore, completed with power transmission forms specially designed therefor rhombic linked chain for the cone pulleys and roller meshing for the gears. The elements comprising the inertial rotoac cumulator are 1 Rotational kinetic energy accumulator fly w eel 2 infinite ratio planetary 3 Speed ratio control system 4 Transmission 1 Rotational kinetic energy accumulator flywheel. The accumulator flywheel can be of two basic types with constant moment of inertia rigid flyheel or uith adjustable moment of inertia. The second possibility involves 2 reinforcement of the function of the infinite ratio planetary since the increase in the moment of inertia is equivalent to the increase in the kinetic energy for 2 given speed, so that if the speed ratio remains constant the effect is a braking, to withdraw the necessary energy. Adjustment of the moment of inertia can be achieved in two ways a the flywheel is formed of a shaft from which articulated arms supporting counterweights protrude.A group of arms is coupled to the shaft by means of a clamp displaceable therealong, so that the radius of turn of the counterweights depends on the position of the clamp. b the flywheel is rigid and hollow. The interior thereof can be filled with mercury which can be pumped towards the axis of rotation or it can be displaced by the centrifugal force to the peripheral area of maximum speed of rotation Any one of these two systems permits sudden changes of speed, but of a minor amplitude. They can be combined with the planetary, acting as a complement thereof. The main defect thereof, is that they cannot reach such high speeds of rotation as the rigid flywheel, in case a because the centrifugal force on the counter weights is borne by the arms and not by the material of the counterweights themselves since a continuous circle is not formed . In case b , because the material should bear its apparent nweightn in the gravitational centrifugal field , plus that of the mercury. In the case of the rigid ring shaped flywheel whose weight is concentrated in the periphery, the maximum linear speed at which it can move is given by EMI8.1 wherein k is the tensional stress tension section to which the material can be subjected and T its density.If the flywheel should store a kinetic energy equal to the maximum of the vehicle so that its kinetic moment is at a maximum when the vehicle is at rest, and zero when it reaches its maximum speed, it can easily be deduced that the ratio of the flywheel weight to the total of the vehicle is EMI8.2 m being the weight of the flywheel, M that of the vehicle, and Vm the maximum speed of the vehicle. Thus, for example, if the material is ordinary steel and assuming that the maximum tension is of l, OO Kp cm2 sufficiently conservative and the maximum vehicle speed is of 130 Km h, the weight of the flywheel will be in the range of 6 of the total. Using synthetic fibers, such as nylon or kevla, this percentage can be highly reduced. For a setter understanding of this invention, a set of drawings is accompanied, forming an integral part of this specification, wherein illustratively and not limiting, the following is represented Figure 1 is a sectional schematic view of the infinite ratio planetary incorporated to the inertial rotoaccumulator of the invention. Figure 2 is a plan view of the transmission chain connecting the pulleys of the infinite ratio planetary. Figure 3 is a sectional view taken on line A B of figure 2. Figure 4 is a perspective view of the link of the chain of figure 2. Figure 5 is a section taken on line C D of figure 4. Figure 6 is a sectional view of a pulley to which the chained transmission system of figure 2 is coupled. Figure 7 is a plan view of the roller mesh transmission, for the mechanical connection of the infinite ratio planetary. Figure 8 is a section taken on line E F of figure 7. referring to the mentioned figures, it can be seen that the inertial rotoaccumulator system of the in vention has an infinite ratio planetary illustrated in figure 1, comprised of the following parts A Crankahaft Nain shaftB1 and B2 Pulleys or gears coaxial with secondary shafts O Dual satellite pulley or dual gear comprised of two integral pulleys Cl and C2D Inner power transmission, between B1 and B2 The material shaft of B2 surrounds that of B1, the axis geometric of both prolongation of that of A. 32 rests on B1 by bearings. The satellite C con rotate idly about the end of the crankshaft A, its axis being parallel and eccen tric to the main shaft The pulley or gear Cl is connected to B1, and O2 to B2, by means of the respective pulleys B1 and 32 If C and B are formed of gears instead of pulleys, it is possible and convenient to construct A with various arms, so that there are two, three or more satellites in symmetrical arrangement, preventing vibrations of A due to eccentricity. D is any system which connects B1 to B2 so that between their speeds there is a controlled ratio, either fixed when the radii of at least one of the pairs of pulleys of the transmission Bl Cl and or B2 02 , or variable when the former are fixed and if the pulleys of B and C are replaced by gears .It is formed of parts D1, pulley or gear acting on B1, by means of the pulley or gear B21 D2, ditto on 32 D is capable of being a snafu parallel to the main shaft A with two integral pulleys a shaft parallel to the main shaft with two gears or with a single gear having a normal axis to the main shaft, connecting in any case B1 to B2, these latter alternatives not being illustrated in the figures. In a simplified planetary, the inner power transmission D disappears, since the secondary shaft B2 is stationary. The theoretic basis of the capacity of this system to convert a finite interval quotient of maximum and minimum speed ratio by means of adjustable opening cone pulleys at the connection B C or at D to another infinite, capable furthermore of changing sign, is as follows Lrefeps to the angular speed of crankshaft A t J refers to the satellite C ts01 and 2 refer to the secondary shaft B1 and B2 R1 and R2 refer to the radii of the pulleys or gears of 31 and B2 rl and r2 refer to the radii of the pulleys or gears of C1 and C2 To simplify the calculation, a system of coordinates rotating together with the crankshaft shall be taken as a reference.In said system the crankshaft is stationary and the speeds of the secondary shaftsB1 and B2 and of the satellite C are respectively EMI11.1 Thie to the connection B11 C1, the equation in abvolute values change the sign if, instead of pulleys, they are gears of the linear speed of both are complied with EMI12.1 Then the angular speed of C1 is EMI12.2 The same ratio is complied with for B242 and as C1 and C2 are integral pulleys EMI12.3 The inner transmission D , establishes a ratio between the speeds 1 and W2, denominated as alpha EMI12.4 Then substituting EMI12.5 refers to the expression EMI12.6 ThenEMI13.1 The forms of control are the following a If we now assume that ss is constant the connection B C can then be either by pulleys or by gears and alpha is variable D is formed of controlled opening cone pulleys , we have EMI13.2 for any value of tJl is a sign opposite to VJ1 is the same sign as LJ Therefore, we should connect A to the tmansmis sion of the vehicle and W1 to the accumulator flywheel.Acceleration or braking is produced, respectively, by reducing or increasing the alpha ratio. Braking is continued in reverse gear, without having to release the clutch, since alpha increases. In this sytem it is not possible for 1 to be zero when is finite. b Let us now assume that alpha 1 and ss is variable EMI13.3 for any for any Since can be greater or lesser than 1, to study the entire range of speeds, let us adopt. one of the hypothesis O alpha 1. The ranges in which ss should be studied are 0 1, l O y . There will be a ssmin per taining to the rst and a ssmax. pertaining to the third. are the manges to be considered.for ss min. ss 1, the numerator and denominator of formula 2 are positive. Jlispositive if we assume this to be the sign of 1 and it increases with Since tends to 1, 1 tends to , which means that W1 should tend to zero. If ss min. ss ss 1, the denomination of 2 is negative, the numerator is positive, then t is negative and decreasing in absolute value. For mechani cal reasons, it will be preferable to state that for a given , l is negative and increasing from zero . For ss 1 alpha , the numeration of 2 is can celled and therefore j is zero. For 1 mag 5 both the numerator and the denominator are negative, Qis positive and in creases with ss for t 3 constant . We note that the change of ss offers a wider range of movement and naturally the separation of the cone pulleys whose axis rotates C should be controlled.This system, with the adjustment of the moment of inertia of the flywheel, will only be of interest in special cases and requires the complement of suitable servo mechanism not described here since we are dealing with particulars of the embodiment of the inertial rotoaccumulator. c bet us assume, finally, that alpha O and ssis variable. Formula 1 is simplified as follows EMI15.1 If the extremes of ss are such that ssmin. 1 ssmax., we haveEMI15.2 positive, decreasing upon increasing negative, increasing in absolute value when ss increases reverse . In this system D disappears. Referring to the adjustment of , that is the ratioEMI15.3 of the radii of the pulleys B1 and B2, C1 and C2, it is necessary to point out that if the separation of the cones of B2, whose axis is stationary, is adjusted, it is activated by the tension of the belt or chain on those of C2, and these on Cl the adjacent cones of both can be integral in the linear displacement along the axis of C the separation at C implies approximation at C1 , and these on B1. The mechanical control is even simpler than in case a . We shall immediately see that from the point of view of losses of energy due to friction, this system is less favourable than the other two. dissipated tower For a better idea, let us assume the control system a , in which ais the speed which should be able to be reduced to zero or become negative andsJl B1 is the shaft connected to the fly .heel is that which should normally be increased upon braking. In general, except when the vehicle moves at high speeds,3l and 2 will be sufficiently greater than Discarding for the moment frictions, P shall refer to the torque acting on A. P1 the torque acting on B1 and C1 P2 the torque acting on 32 from C2. It has to be equal and contrary to the torquf acting on 32 from 31 through D, due to the equilibrium of It will be complied with for powers EMI16.1 that is, the power transmitted by 3 to A is equal to that which it receives from the flywheel. On the other hand, P P1 P2P1 P necessarily, P2 could also be so, likewise. However, if we now consider the inner frictions and to simplify matters, let us assume that the dissipated power is a constant fraction and naturally reduced of the power being transmitted at the contact zone in which said dissipation takes place, the total dissipated power will be EMI16.2 The expression in parenthesis refers to a circulating power within the planetary. This power is, in general, greater than P. JLwhich is that entering and leaving the apparatus.The ratio between both depends on the value of the quotient R wi1 When this quotient is equal to 1 and 1 which can occur in the form of speed ratio control a and b , but not in c , there are no slidings between 3 and C, the shafts B1 and 32 turn at the same speed and they could be engaged, short circuiting the transmission D. In this case, the circulating power is zero. On the other hand, when Q tends to zero when the vehicle is braked andW1 to its maximum, the ratio of the circulating power to the true power tends to infinity. This does not mean that the dissipated power tends to infinity, but it is dissipated, the majority of which is being withdrawn from the vehicle. From this consideration various practical conclusions are reached 1. The energetic behaviour in control systems a and t is optimum in the proximity of D 1. The iner tial rotoaccumulator should be designed so that this value corresponds to the most usual speed of the vehicle. We do not consider, in the dissipated powers, frictions at shaft A, at the idler shaft of C, nor at the connection B1 flywheel, which can be direct. 2. It is convenient to lessen the difference between1 and A to connect the flywheel to B1, or A to the transmission of the vehicle, through a ratio which can be constant or variable. This case involves the complication not described here of servomechanisms which automatically distribute the speed ratios of flywheel to vetiicle between the planetary and this second variable transmission. n. As stated at the beginning, in the final step of complete braking of the ve,icle, the inertial rotoaccumulator is not energetically superior to the mentioned mixed system. 4. The simplest type of planetary form of control c is not energetically the most favourable, though a second ratio which can be constant, to conserve the simplicity can compensate for this, to a large extent. 5. In any case, to reduce the dissipated power within the planetary, it is convenient to modify the main dissipating elements thereof which are the following Friction Reduction 1. Rnombic linked chain The functioning of this modification of the normal chain is sufficiently explained in figures 2 to 5 of the drawings.Friction diminishes with respect to the normal chain according to the ratio r R, where P is the radius of the axis to which two successive links of the latter are attached, while r is the radius of curvature of the contact zone between the two rhomic links, so that if 5tis the angular opening of said zone and its width, i.r.t is the surface capable of transmitting the tension to which the chain is subjected, depending on the flexible characteristics of the material.2. n.oller meshing The purpose of the roller meshing is to eliminate the sliding on the contact surface of the teeth of the gears Functioning is explained in figures 7 and 8.It comprises two wheels, one toothed and the other having bearings, small cylinders resting on two channels the diameter of the cylinder on which the tooth acts and its lateral projections placed in the channels not need be equal . When in contact, the tooth is displaced inwards in the channel, so that the bearing runs following half of the path of the tooth in the event the radius of the bearing is constant . When the tooth is situated on the line which joins the axles of the wheels, that is at half of the contact gap between both, the bearing reaches its inner end position. From this position, it turns again in a contrary direction, so that when it looses contact with the tooth, it is again located at the outer end of the channels. The bearings should be disposed at said outer end when contacting the teeth. This can be achieved in various ways with a poorly constant spring it can merely be a thin steel ring which compresses the bearings simultaneously , with permanent magnets since the tooth leaves the bearing in the same position in which it finds it , when the constant position of the shafts permits same, by mere gravity the toothed wheel below that of the bearings .... In the majority of the cases, the centrifugal force will be sufficient to maintain the bearings in their distal position when they are not subject to the action of the teeth. The ideal solution would be for the profile of the tooth and that of the channel to be such that the movement, without sliding of the bearings, were to imply that these were subject to two opposed forces according to a diameter. Geometrically, this is not pos sible. Tsie deviation of the linear opposition can be sufficiently small so that the tangential resultant on the bearing can be balanced by the static friction thereof with the tooth and the channels therefore without carrying out frictional work .Steed jL atio Control System The control system of the speed ratio can be voluntary or automatic. The automatic control would be necessary in tose modifications of the inertial rotoaccumulator in which the speed ratio change is not a direct and unique manner of controlling the vehicle speed, when it is combined with the change of the moment of inertia of the fflywreel, or because the storage of rotational energy is combined with another electric accumulators, for mpIe Basically, the control of the speed ratio will be voluntary. When describing the infinite ratio planetary, we observed that the speed ratio will consist, in general, in displacing one of the cone pulleys, which can form part of the inner power transmission D, or in connecting the satellite to a secondary shaft. The control system of the speed ratio should exert on said cone a force which will be balanced with the actions of the chains on the pulleys and with springs acting on another displaceable cone. Said force should make the cone stationary, or displace it in one direction or the other at 2 speed which will depend on the position of the control lever, pedal or controls of acceleration or braking . Therefore, the speed ratio control system re quires a mechanism which converts a variable the position of the controls to the time derivative of another variable the position of the adjusting cone . This can be carried out in various ways known at present, where fore no particular description thereof will be made. The transmission used in the inertial rotoac cumulator involves the existence of three power sources which should be connected together so that it is possible to transmit it in all directions the vehicle wheels , the flywheel, and the engine. The wheels flywheel connection is the basis of te system and should be through an infinite ratio plane tary, so that it is possible to reach the complete stoppage of the vehicle. The flywheel motor connection is necessary to initially charge the flywheel. Therewith the accumula tor wheel can act as the engine flywheel, if it is an explosion engine, being partially compensated with its weight. It can be used to accelerate the engine, in creasing its power without increasing the motor torque. If the engine is electric, it can serve to use a second storage system with batteries applied at longer time intervals than those which can be covered by the iner tial rotoaccumulator for example, restoring power when running down steep hills . In general, this connection should take place by a continuous speed ratio changing system, but not necessarily with an infinte ratio planetary, since it is not necessary for the flywheel or the motor to be stopped when the other is turning. In the case of the elec iric engine, it is possible for this to be connected directly to the flywheel or even for its rotor to coincide therewith, unrest if use is made of the permanent magnet. The direct connection of the motor wheels, without passing the flywheel, is not necessary but recom bendable for energetic reasons, since in constant, horizontal movement, the flywheel neither gives off nor ab sorbs energy and this passes from the motor to the wheels the more direct the transmission, the minor the losses. This connection should also be made with a continuous speed ratio changing system with an infinite ratio planetary or without it, but with an automatic clutch.
