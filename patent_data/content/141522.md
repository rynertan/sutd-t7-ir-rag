# Dot printer head.

## Abstract
This invention is constructed such that opposed surfaces of armatures 18 are formed between the armatures adja cent to each other with small gap being left therebetween and cores 17 opposed to each of the armatures 18 are provided with alternative opposed magnetic fluxes, wherein the armatures 18 are supported in such a way as the guide means 19 formed in them are engaged with the fixed armature guides 20 without applying their side surfaces, and thereby side magnetic paths of sufficient cross sectional area can be formed, and further their equivalent mass can be decreased and a high speed printing is enabled, and the armatures can be moved smoothly.
