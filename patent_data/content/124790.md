# Electrical power assisted steering mechanism.

## Abstract
An electric power assisted steering mechanism for a automotive vehicle having a torque shaft 12 interconnecting the vehicles steering wheel with the steering gear box. Electri cal power is applied to the output end of the torque shaft 12 by a low speed, high torque electrical motor 36 through a low gear ratio planetary gear system 18 disposed concentri cally about the torque shaft 12 . The electric motor 36 is energized by a power amplifier 40 in response to a torque signal generated by a torque sensor 42 responsive to the magnitude and direction of the torque applied between the input and output ends of the torque shaft 12 . The power amplifier 40 has an anti log gain characteristic eliminating the need for a vehicle speed input to reduce or eliminate the authority of the power steering mechanism a nominal and higher vehicle speeds.
