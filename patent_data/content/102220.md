## Description
DESCRIPTION NSHEATHw The present invention relates to improvements in a sheath for retaining body heat and supporting the muscle structure of a wearer. It consists of the combinations, constructions, and arrangement of parts, as hereinafter described and claimed.It is a well known fact that the heat loss or cooling out of muscles is the source of most muscle injuries of athletes. Ily sheath is so constructed as to prevent this heat loss, and still to allow full function of the enclosed muscles and substantially free circulation of blood through the wearer S member that is enclosed in the sheath.Another object of my invention is to provide a device of the character described which is simple in construction, durable and efficient for the purpose intended, and which may be readily applied by the wearer.Other objects and advantages will appear as the specification continues. The novel features of the invention will be set forth in the claims hereto appended.For a better understRnding of the invention, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings forming part of this specification, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the lower leg of a wearer showing my sheath applied to it Figure 2 is a sioe elevational view of my sheath, looking from the lateral aspect of the sheath, part being disclosed in section with a pad being shown on the medial aspect Figure 3 is a horizontal sectional view taken along the plane III III of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a side elevational view of a modified form of my sheath and Figure 5 is a horizontal sectional view taken along the plane V V of Figure 4. Figure 6 is a perspective view of the thigh of a wearer showing my sheath applied to it Figure 7 is a perspective view showing my sheath applied to a back While I have shown only the preferred forms of my invention it should be understood that various changes, or modifications, may be made within the scope of the annexed claims without departing from the spirit of them. PEeferring now to Figure 1 in detail, I have shown the lower right leg of a wearer, designated generally at A, which has one of my sheaths B applied so as to enclose at least part of the lower leg. Of course, the sheath may be designed to enclose any selected member of the wearer, for example, the upper leg C, the lower or upper arm not shown , or the waist of the wearer. Sheaths according to my invention may also be applied to an elbow, an adductor muscle,an ankle or a knee, using the same principles of heat and support expounded here.For the purpose of illustration, I have shown the lower leg as constituting the selected member that is enclosed by the tubular sheath B. In order that the use of the sheath may be easily understood, I shall briefly set forth the anatomical features of the lower leg A. The tibia 10, or shin bone, extends from the femur 11 to the astragal 12 and the tibialis anterior muscle 13 extends generally lengthwise of the tibia on the lateral aspect or outer side 14 of the lower leg. The tibia 10 is located on the plane 15 that extends from the anterior aspect 16 to the posterior aspect 17 see Figure 3 . The soleus muscle 18 is located on the medial aspect or inside 19 of the lower leg A.As clearly illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the tubular sheath B is contoured to embrace the member of the wearer, here shown as being the lower leg A. This tubular sheath is made from foam rubber neoprene to prevent loss of body heat from the enclosed member.The sheath B defines an inner surface provided with a muscle supporting rib 20, which is disposed to extend generally lengthwise of the enclosed member A. The rib 20 is disposed to one side cf the anterior posterior mesial plane 15 in a position to press against and support a muscle structure of the wearer, here shown as the tibialis anterior muscle 13, in its proper location with respect to a bone of the enclosed member, here the tibia 10.It l 5rportant that the sheath B and the rib 20 be made sufficiently resilient to allow full functioning of the supported muscle and substantially free circulation of blood through the enclosed member of the wearer. This rib is made of the same material as the sheath B, and is bonded integrally to the inside surface of the sheath. The rib 20 extends substantially throughout the length of the sheath B from its upper end 21 to its lower end 22 see Figure 1 .The material that I have found suitable for the sheath is a foamed elastomer such as foamed rubber. A foamed rubberised neoprene is particularly suitable. It is for convenience called foam rubber .As disclosed in Figures 2 and 3, a resilient substantially triangular shaped pad 23 may be disposed on the medial aspect 19 of the sheath of the inside surface of the latter so as to bear against and support the soleus muscle 18 of the enclosed leg.The sheath B may be fashioned from a sheet of foam rubber and its longitudinal edges 24 brought into abutting relation with one another see Figure 3 , and then a strip of foam rubber 25 m ay be bounded over these abutting edges to extend from the upper end 21 of the sheath to the lower end 22 thereof. Alternatively the edges 24 may be stitched. This type of tubular sheath must be pulled over the foot 26 of the wearer, when it is applied to the lower leg A.Turning now to the modified form of the invention, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, the sheath B is made of the nwraparoundn type otherwise, it is the same as the sheath shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Accordingly, like reference characters have been applied to corrresponding parts of the two embodiments or forms of the invention.As illustrated in Figure 4, the modified tubular sheath B is split along its length from its upper end 21 to its lower end 22. This sheath has adjacent edges 27 and 28 bordering the split, when the sheath is wrapped around the wearer s member. A conventional zipper D has coacting parts attached to the edges 27 and 28 of the sheath B. This zipper is operable by a slide 29 to removably secure the sheath around the wearer s member. In Figure 5, 1 show the resilient muscle supporting rib 20 as being secured to and extending beneath one of the marginal sections that borders the split, here the edge 27. This rib has a free flap portion 30 that is insertable into a position under the other marginal section 28. The zipper is disposed outwardly of the resilient rib 20 so that the enclosed member of the wearer will be protected against contact by the zipper when it is activated. The zipper D is made of the type that has a pin 31 on one of its parts that is adapted to be inserted into a socket 32 fixed to the other part of the zipper. With this arrangement, the sheath B may be wrapped around the member of the wearer, and then the pin 31 inserted into the socket. At this time, the slide 29 may be pulled so as to join the two coacting parts of the zipper D together.It will be apparent that the modified tubular sheath B need not be pulled over the wearer s foot or other extremity.Otherwise the construction and operation of the two forms of the invention are the same and serve identical purposes.Figure 6 shows internal rubber plates 33 in the thigh unit designed to provide special support to the front part of the thigh i.e. the quadriceps muscle group . Similar internal plates in the rear provide special support to the back part of the thigh i.e. the hamstring group . The unit also provides general support to the other muscles of the thigh, including the lower part of the adductor muscles.Until now, adhesive tape and elastic bandages have been applied by medical staff and trainers to reduce pain and to support and protect the injured muscles. However, because of the lack of flexibility and thermal effect with the tape and the problem of keeping elastic bandages in place these methods have generally only had limited success. However, by combining the natural body heat with the directional .support from the rubber plates, the thigh unit according to my invention allows the injured muscle to be exercised without the fear of the muscle getting cold or the risk of further strain.The back unit of Figure 7 is adapted to be worn, by sufferers of muscle spasms in the lumbar region of the back. It is made to cover approximately 32 cm either side of the waist, with internal rubber plates lying over the lumbar muscle of the lower back. Since the back support according to my invention has no metal structural supports, it cannot produce rigid support for the bone structure of the back.However, the general and directional muscular support given by my invention, coupled with its thermal properties, relieve, and in some cases stop, muscle spasms in the lower and middle part of the back.The carefully designed shape of my invention units gives general muscular support to the area of the body covered.Special support comes from in built rubber plates that give directional pressure to key muscles.The insulation properties of my invention units retain body heat.The combined effect of the support and heat is a higher level of blood circulation, muscle temperature and flexibility, promoting the healing of muscle injuries. I ly invention can be worn by anyone needing support and warmth for troublesome muscles.The heat generated is natural. It is also deep, and is therefore more likely to be more effective than analgesic creams or embrocation. rly invention can allow an athlete to train through an injury, so that the athlete s general fitness, skills, muscle strength and confidence can be maintained during the recovery phase. The extra heat generated by the exercise can further accelerate the healing process. The end result is an earlier return to competition. fly providing warmth and muscular support, and also freedom of movement, my invention eliminates the need to apply adhesive tape or an elastic bandage to the affected muscle before exercise. Sly invention can also be used for the prevention of a muscle injury, as a shock absorber in body contact sports, to keep muscles warm during activity in cold conditions and in sports involving stop start action, to improve the effectiveness of a warmup before competition, and as an aid in the rehabilitation of a muscle injury following hospitalisation.
