# A composition containing a dispensible material,a method of dispensing a material onto a surface and a system for dispensing the composition.

## Abstract
A water in air emuls on or suspension containing a dispensible material is formed by stabilization of small droplets 48 of aqueous liquid with an interfacial barrier of very fine, hydrophobic metal oxide particles 42 such as silane modified silica. As the droplets 48 are subjected to shear such as during passage through an orifice 28 , and or on the surface of the target, the shear forces ex perienced at least partially destabilize the barrier allowing the droplets to coalesce to form particles of controlled density and increased size and eventually can be totally destabilized into an elegant cream or lotion. At least 10 of the droplets may coalesce into particles after leaving the orifice. Active ingredients such as antiperspirants may be added to either the aqueous liquid phase or to the powder phase as long as they do not destabilize the suspension. A non pressurized system comprises a container 10 suitable for dispensing the suspension having a compartment 14 receiving the suspension, a valve means 18 having an outlet orifice 28 of a dimension adapted to impart a pre selected shear and destabilization to the suspension and the container being adapted to enable the suspension to be propelled through the outlet orifice. Other dispensing systems include shaker top containers and roll on applica tors.
