# Retention skirt for pacing electrode assembly.

## Abstract
The electrode assembly 12, 70, 120, 170 is adapted to be mounted at the distal end 24, 162, 172 of a pacing lead 10, 164, 174 . The assembly 12, 70, 120, 170 comprises at least a tip electrode 14, 72, 122, 176 and a skirt 16, 74, 124, 178 extending at least part way around the assembly 12, 70, 129, 170 . The skirt 16, 74, 124, 178 extends backwardly from the tip electrode 14, 72, 122, 176 and has slits 31 34 or notches 100 extending axially in the cuff from the rearward edge 28 thereof to separate the skirt 16, 74, 124, 178 into sections 41 44, 91, 134, 201 . The skirt 16, 74, 124, 178 has one or more partially annular radially extending spurs 50, 60, 81, or 132 on each section 41 44, 91, 134 or 201 thereof which are adapted to engage trabeculae in a heart chamber for anchoring and maintaining the electrode assembly 12, 70, 120, 170 in place. The sections 41 44, 91, 134, 201 allow and enhance removal of the electrode assembly 12, 70, 120, 170 when desired by the application of sufficient tension to the pacing lead 10, 164, 174 to cause the skirt sections 41 44, 91, 134, 201 to fold back over themselves as the pacing lead 10, 164, 174 is withdrawn from the body.
