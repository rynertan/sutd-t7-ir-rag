# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A high pressure discharge lamp comprising a discharge vessel 3 in which an electrode comprising a resistive element 4 is present, said resistive element consisting of two parallel arranged branches having substantially the same electrical resistance. With such an electrode construction it is achieved that the starting point of the discharge on the electrode is stabilized.
