# Ultrasonic atomizer.

## Abstract
This ultrasonic atomizer 1 includes an oscillating member 18 , a means 13 for vibrating the oscillating member 18 at a supersonic frequency, a bottle 16 for liq uid storage, with an opening, fitted generally above the os cillating member 18 with regard to the preferred orient ation of the atomizer during use, and a nozzle 17 fitted into the opening 22 of the bottle 16 , this nozzle 17 having a tip portion 29 protruding outside the bottle 16 in the gen erally downwards direction and approached closely to the oscillating member 18 . The nozzle 17 is formed with a fine groove 25 for leading liquid in the bottle downwards to the tip portion 29 of the nozzle 17 by capillary action and by gravitational action, and with an aperture 26 for intro ducing air from the outside into the bottle. Thereby liquid in the bottle 16 may be properly supplied to the oscillating member 18 to be atomized in a controlled fashion, and in terruption of liquid supply and also dribbling of liquid are positively prevented. Constructions for the nozzle 17 and for the bottle 16 are also disclosed.
