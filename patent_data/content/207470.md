# Mispicked weft yarn removing method and system therefor.

## Abstract
A method of removing a mispicked weft yarn when a mispick occurs in a loom. The operation of the loom is stop ped in a state where the mispicked weft yarn is connected to weft inserting means after the mispicked weft yarn is beaten up by a reed. The mispicked weft yarn is exposed at the cloth fell of a woven cloth. A weft yarn connected to the mispicked weft yarn is inserted from a weft picking side to a counter weft picking side of the loom. The inserted weft yarn is drawn together with the mispicked weft yarn to the counter weft picking side, thereby effectively peeling off the mispicked weft yarn from the cloth fell.
