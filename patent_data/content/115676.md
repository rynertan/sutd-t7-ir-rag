# INK SUPPLY UNIT AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
The ink supply unit comprising a porous ink containing body 2 having a radially outer surface 16 which in use is impacted by a printing element, and an ink impervious member 6 located adjacent a side surface of the body 2 to prevent ink loss therefrom. The surface 16 is treated to improve its resistance to impact by the printing element. One method of making the unit is to mould the member 16 onto the outer and side surfaces of body 2 and then remove that portion of the moulded member from surface 16 to expose the body, the material being impregnated into the pores of body 2 adjacent surface 16 to improve its impact resistance.
