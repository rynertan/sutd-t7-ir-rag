# Well cementing methods and compositions.

## Abstract
A cementing composition for use in cementing operations for oil and gas wells having bottom hole circulating temperatures above about 200 DEG F 93 DEG C , comprising a salt or fresh water cement slurry, a water soluble form of borate, and a terpolymer, wherein said terpolymer is comprised of about 10 65 mole percent of a strong acid monomer selected from sodium vinylsulfonate, 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid, and vinyl benzene sulfonic acid about 10 60 mole percent of a weak acid monomer selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid and vinyl acetic acid and about 10 60 mole percent of a nonionic monomer selected from acrylamide, N vinylpyrrolidone and N,N dimethylacrylamide wherein the average molecular weight of said terpolymer is between about 10 000 and about 100 000.
