# Scored reverse buckling rupture disc.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a scored reverse buckling rupture disc 16 of desired reversal rupture pressure including the steps of forming a concave convex dome 20 in a sheet of metal, selecting the depth and the variation in depth in a direction towards the periphery of the dome of scores 24 to be formed in a surface of the dome, adjusting score forming means according to said selctions and forming the scores on a surface of said dome thereby creating lines of weakness therein, said scores extending outwardly from a central portion of the dome towards the periphery. Apparatus of the invention can include an anvil cooperating with a curved edged blade in such a way that they are relatively movable, by rotational or longitudinal movement, so that the variation in depth of the grooves from the centre outwardly can be altered.
