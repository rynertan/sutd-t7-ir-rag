# A rotor for a disc brake assembly.

## Abstract
A rotor for a disc brake assembly includes at least two members 40, 42 opposing a pair of friction elements 16, 18 . The members are stamped to form projections 46 in abutment with each other to join the members together. The projections 46 also space the members from each other to form a clearance 58 and a connecting portion 44 cooperates with some of the projections 46 to prevent rotation between the connecting portion 44 and the two members 40, 42 .
