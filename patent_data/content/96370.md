# Power supply device.

## Abstract
A power supply device includes a plurality of switching regulators and a waveshaping circuit, or, a switching circuit for converting an input voltage to switching pulses, a transformer for transforming the voltage of the pulses generated in the switching circuit, a rectifier circuit for rectifying the switching pulses provided through the trans former, a switching regulator into which the resulting d.c. input is supplied from the rectifier circuit and a waveshaping circuit. The former waveshaping circuit shapes the waveform of switching pulses generated within one switching regulator of the plurality of switching regulators and supplies the shaped output to the other switching regulators as an input reference waveform. The latter waveshaping circuit shapes the waveform of the switching pulses provided from the transformer and supplies the resulting function waveform to a pulse control unit in the switching regulator as an input reference waveform. In the case of a plurality of switching regulators of the separately excited type, a reference wave form supplied each switching regulator may be provided from a common waveform generator.
