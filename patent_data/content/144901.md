# High density information records of an electrostatic capacitance type.

## Abstract
High density information records formed from conduc tive resin compositions which comprise a graft polymer obtained by subjecting vinyl chloride monomer to graft polymerization with a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate having a content of vinyl acetate of not less than 35 wt and a melt index up to 20 and prepared according to a solution polymerization technique. The conductive composi tion further comprises predetermined amounts of a conduc tive material and a lubricant of a specific type. The lubricant is an ester between aliphatic acid and alcohol having a hydroxyl value not larger than 15.
