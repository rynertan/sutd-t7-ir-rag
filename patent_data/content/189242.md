## Description
This invention relates to multi layer heat sealable structures having exceptionally low film to film coefficients of friction over a wide temperature range and which, when used to wrap packages secured by a heat seal layer or layers, avoids pack drag. This invention is also directed to multi layer film structures having improved aesthetic appearance together with improved roll conformation and the avoidance of corrugation of finished goods in mill roll form. All of the foregoing improvements are secured without adversely affecting the high speed packaging performance of the films. Highly crystalline polypropylene film is an excellent packaging material, but it has high film to film coefficient of friction which makes it difficult to utilize in automatic packaging equipment. Certain innovations have improved on the surface friction characteristics of highly crystalline polypropylene in film form. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,176,021, it is taught to include minor quantities of fatty acid amides into the polypropylene. In order to obtain the benefits taught by this patent, however, certain limitations must be observed. The film must be formed from a melt and, extruded at a temperature between about 204 288 C 400 550 F . In addition, the amide must be present in amounts of from 0.005 to about 2.0 weight percent of the polypropylene and it must be present along with from about 0.1 to about 4.0 weight percent polyethylene. Under these conditions and limitations resulting polypropylene film has static coefficients of friction which are significantly higher than present day requirements. In addition, such a film does not have the high stereoregularity required by present day packaging demands. Further, it has been found that once such films have been subjected to the high temperatures which are experienced in practice such as coefficient of friction increases significantly and is nowhere near the present day requirements of about 0.25. In U.S. Patent No. 3,399,156, it is taught that the inclusion of the combination of silicone oil and finely divided silica into a polypropylene film produces a film which has a coefficient of friction of from 0.45 and 0.46 and is suitable for use in bread wrapping machines. This is not a low enough co efficient of friction for use in present day, high speed automatic packaging machinery, however. It has been found that to a certain extent high crystallinity in polypropylene impedes facile migration of additives to the surface of such a polymer in film form. This problem has been addressed in U.S. Patent No. 4,419,410. This patent teaches that by the coextrusion of a skin layer of polypropylene of comparatively low stereoregularity with a core layer of polypropylene of comparatively high stereoregularity, containing a surface modifying agent such as an amide of a fatty acid, the amide will bloom to the surface of the layer having the comparatively low stereoregularity polymer with comparative ease. U.S. Patent No. 4,419,411, significantly advanced the art of making multi layer polypropylene films suitable for most high speed packaging operations. This patent discloses a multi layer polypropylene film structure having surface modifying agents comprising finely divided silica, silicone oil and an amide of a water insoluble mono carboxylic acid having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms on a surface thereof. Thus, there is a need for multi layer film structures having surface layers with extremely low coefficients of friction over a wide temperature range. In US Patent No. 3 503 842 there is disclosed a plastic film laminate comprising an oriented polypropylene polyethylene film laminate having the exposed surface of the polyethylene film coated with a copolymer of a vinylester and an ethylenically unsaturated organic acid having up to six carbon atoms. The specification discloses the use of microcrystalline wax in minor proportions to provide anti blocking characteristics. The present invention provides a coextruded multi layer film structure comprising a base layer comprising polypropylene of comparatively high stereoregularity and a first heat sealable skin layer on the base layer comprising a first polyolefin of comparatively low stereoregularity, wherein the film structure has included therein an amount of fatty acid amide sufficient to provide the structure with coefficient of friction properties sufficient for high speed heat sealing packaging operations but insufficient to cause substantial hazing of the structure characterised in that a second heat sealable layer is provided on the base layer which comprises a second polyolefin of comparatively low stereoregularity, and each of said first and second layers further comprises from 5 to 15 by weight of microcrystalline wax. At least one sealable layer preferably comprises finely divided anti blocking agent as well. The invention also provides a method for preparing a multi layer film structure which comprises melt coextruding the multi layer film structure defined above. Further features of the invention are defined in the dependent claims. The present invention is directed to the improvement of the characteristics of a multi layer film structure, the base layer of which is highly crystalline or highly stereoregular polypropylene in film form, preferably oriented film form. The preferred polypropylenes are well known in the art and are formed by polymerizing propylene in the presence of stereospecific catalyst systems. They can have a melt flow rate at 230 C 446⁰F ranging from about 1 to about 25, preferably 1.5 to 8 and even more preferably from about 2 to about 4. The crystalline melting point is about 160 163 C 321 325 F . The number average molecular weight ranges from about 25,000 to about 100,000, while the density ranges from about 0.90 to 0.91 gm cm The amide which provides good slip properties to the structure is preferably selected from saturated and unsaturated fatty acid amides more preferably it is an amide of a water insoluble mono carboxylic acid having about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms or mixtures of the amides. Specific, preferred, examples of this class of amides are erucamide, oleamide, stearamide, behenamide, and the like. While the amount of amide is best defined by the result to be accomplished, it is preferred that this additive be included in the film structure in an amount of 0.02 to 0.20 , preferably 0.05 to 0.20 , by weight, and even more preferred in amounts between 0.075 and 0.10 by weight. It is to be understood that the amide may preferably be provided in the comparatively low stereoregular copolymer by dispersing the amide in the resin precursor of the comparatively high stereoregular polypropylene alone. The amide then exudes from the base layer through the copolymer film to its surface by blooming as is understood by those of skill in the art. Thus, amide additive in the outer film resin starting material is not generally necessary although it may be employed. The percentage of the amide in the multi layer structure should be such as to yield a coefficient of friction of the surface of the skin layer of less than about 0.30, preferably less than about 0.25. More particularly, the proportions should be such that the coefficient of friction of the surface of the skin layer or layers is about 0.25 at room temperature and is maintainable at less than 0.8 up to 93 C 200 F . The amide is preferably dry blended together with the polopropylene resin and then melt mixed. Alternatively, the amide can be incorporated into a minor portion of the polypropylene as a master batch to form a high concentration mix of the amide and the polypropylene. This may then be diluted to the appropriate proportion by the addition of more polypropylene. While the amide is added to the base resin, when the base resin is coextruded with skin polymers some portions of the amide enters into and moves to the surface of the skin layer. Tnus, by this mechanism blooming, the amide is available at the surface of the skin layers so as to beneficially effect, in combination with the microcrystalline wax, the coefficient of friction and anti stick characteristics of the composite film. The polyolefins of comparatively low stereoregularity contemplated as comprising the skin materials of the present multi layer structures include, for example, random co polymers of ethylene and propylene and ethylene propylene butene l terpolymers. Particularly preferred are the ethylene propylene butene l terpolymers which contain from 2 to 7 wt. and, more preferably, from 3 to 5 by weight of ethylene, 2 to 7 wt. , preferably 3 to 5 by weight of l butene. They can have a melt flow rate at 230 F 446 F . ranging from about 2 to 15 and preferably 3 to 8. The crystalline melting point is about 122 to 150 C 251 to 302 F . Preferably, the second polyolefin has a melting point sufficiently less than the first polyolefin to cause the second heat sealable layer to exhibit an effective heat sealing temperature at least 5.6 c 10 F lower than that of the first heat sealable layer. The number average molecular weight ranges from 25,000 to 100,000. The density ranges from about 0.89 to 0.90 gm cm3 890 to 900 kg m³ . These terpolymers have excellent heat seal characteristics. They do not, however, have the excellent physical characteristics inherent in the polypropylene of comparatively high stereoregularity. Thus, the base material polypropylene of high stereoregularity possesses the excellent characteristics of good moisture barrier quality, stiffness, high strength and optical properties. Wnile the thin co extruded surface layers of the comparatively low stereoregular terpolymers provide excellent heat seal characteristics, to take advantage of these characteristics, the skin layers must be modified so as to exhibit the characteristics of good slip and the tendency not to stick to an adjacent film region after being exposed to heat seal temperatures. At the same time it is desired to avoid additions of amounts of additives which lead to non uniformity and haze. The overall thickness of the contemplated multi layer structure is due primarily to the highly stereoregular polypropylene base layer. The coextruded skin layers of comparatively low stereoregularity are present on both surfaces of the base layer. It is preferred that the skin layers have thicknesses of less than about 0.8 microns. So long as the continuity of the film structure is maintained, the minimum thicknesses of the skin layers are not important. Present day techniques will easily permit film thicknesses of about 0.3 microns or less. The finely divided anti blocking agent preferred for inclusion in at least one of the heat sealable skin layers may be any Particulate inorganic material, preferably having a mean particle size ranging from 0.5 to 5 microns. One commercially available silica has a mean particle size of 0.75 microns and another has a mean particle size of 4.5 microns. Either material can be employed. Metal silicates, glasses, clays and numerous other finely comminuted inorganic materials may also be used. The anti blocking agent is preferably present in from 0.05 to 0.5 wt. , preferably 0.1 to 0.3 wt. of each of the the skin layers. A key component of the multi layer film structure is microcrystalline wax. Thus microcrystalline wax is incorporated into each of the heat sealable skin layers to accomplish the beneficial objects of the invention in synergistic combination with the other components. Employment of the wax permits the use of much lower amounts of amide than would otherwise be required and results in superior appearance and physical performance of the films. This is so because the amide contributes to a hazy appearance of those films. Useful waxes may be any of the known microcrystalline waxes. It is preferred, however, that synthetic n paraffinic waxes be used. Preferably the wax has a melting point between 85 C and l60 C. The wax is added in amounts between 5 to 15 by weight of each of the skin layers and most preferably at about 10 . A further, preferred, additive for inclusion in the skin layers is glycerol monostearate or other monoglyceride which may preferably be included in amounts between about 0.05 and 0.3 by weight of the layer and most preferably at about 0.1 by weight. The multi layer films of the present invention can be prepared by using commercially available systems for coextruding resins. The polypropylene homopolymer of comparatively high stereoregularity containing amide is preferably coextruded with an ethylene propylene random copolymer of comparatively low stereoregularity containing the appropriate percentage of the combination of wax and optional components such as anti blocking agent. The polymers can be brought to the molten state and coextruded from a conventional extruder through a flat sheet die, the melt streams being combined in an adapter prior to being extruded from the die. After leaving the die orifice, the multi layer film structure is chilled and the quenched sheet then preferably reheated and stretched, e.g., 4 to 6 times in the machine direction and subsequently, for example, 4 to 10 times in the transverse direction. The edges of the film can be trimmed and the film wound onto a core. It is preferred that the thus formed structure be conditioned or equilibrated by holding the same for a period of 6 hours to 1 week at a temperature from 27 to 52 C 80 to l25 F , especially preferred is a time from 6 hours to 72 hours at between 38 52 C 100 125 F . This film will have on the surface thereof a combination of the bloomed amide, and wax together with optional components such as anti blocking agent. The resulting film will have a coefficient of friction of 0.30 or lower, preferably about 0.25 or less and will not block under conditions of tight winding after being held at temperatures up to 60 C l40 F . Some commercially available base polymers and skin polymers and their at least approximate melting points are tabulated below Coefficients of friction COF or slip may be determined by the moving slide stationary film method of U.S. Patent No. 3,399,156. The contemplated films can be tested by feeding a roll of film into a Mira Pak vertical form, fill and seal packaging system. This system is equipped with high precision controllers. During transport through the system each bag is subjected to three heat seal regions which can cause package to package stick and drag. The heat seal time is a fraction of a second. The film must maintain a COF at room temperature of between about 0.2 0.3, usually about 0.25 in order to avoid unacceptable drag which would lead to pack jamming and machine down time. Success of the operation depends on the virtual absence of pack to pack stick and drag, a moderate to low force necessary to move the packs through the system and a seal range of at least 4.4 C 40 F preferably 21 32 C 70 90 F on all seal surfaces. The invention is further elaborated by the following, non limiting examples. A polypropylene homopolymer of comparatively high stereoregularity, i.e. Arco 8670, containing about 750 ppm of erucamide was melted and coextruded with a first skin layer comprising a 50 40 mix of Chisso XF 7700, an ethylene propylene butene 1 terpolymer blended with Arco 756, an ethylene propylene copolymer containing 10 wt of B²195 microcrystalline wax, 0.15 Kapolite SF Anhyhrous aluminum silicate anti blocking agent and 0.15 of Myverol 18 06 distilled monoglycerides. The polypropylene homopolymer was also coextruded with a second skin layer of Chisso XF 7700 terpolymer containing 10 of microcrystalline wax, 0.10 erucamide, 0.10 Syloid 245 silica powder, and 0.10 distilled monoglycerides. The coextrudate was then cooled, reheated and stretched bi axially, 4 6 times in the machine direction, and 8 10 times in the transverse direction. The total gauge of the structure was 0.7 mil, the first and second skins comprising 0.03 and 0.06 mil respectively. The room temperature COF was 0.20 the thermal stability of the COF was good, being satisfactory for packaging operations up to 171 C 340 F . Example 1 was repeated substituting identical skin layers comprising Arco W756 without anti block or wax, the amide level of the base layer was increased to 1200 ppm. The COF was greater than 0.30. The thermal COF at 71 C 160 F and 4 seconds was poor, greater than 1.0. This is unacceptable for packaging operations. Example 2 was repeated but with the addition of 10 B²195 microcrystalline wax to the skin layers. The COF was .25 and was good at elevated temperature. The COF and COF thermal stability were much improved. Example 2 was repeated using XF 7700 terpolymer as the skin layer composition and 900 ppm erucamide in the base layer. The COF was 0.46, too high for satisfactory employment in high speed packaging. Example 4 was repeated adding 10 of microcrystalline wax to the skin layers. The COF was 0.19.
