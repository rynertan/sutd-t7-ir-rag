## Description
This invention relates to a process for increasing the volume percentage of hollow filaments that is void. It is known in the art to produce hollow filaments by spinning multiple molten streams through a spinneret and coalescing the streams while they are still sufficiently tacky to form a bond _ see British Patent 1106 263. It is also known that freshly formed polyester structures may be permanently extended many times their length up to 75 times if the extending process is done under the proper conditions _ see, for example, Pace U.S. Patent 2 578 899. The extending process is carried out under low tension, at a slow rate and at a temperature 20 C to 60 C above the apparent minimum crystallization temperature. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for increasing the volume percentage of hollow filaments that is void, that is to say a process for increasing the percent void. According to the present invention there is provided a process for increasing the percent void of hollow polyester filaments which comprises melt spinning a hollow polyester filament, and while the filament is still substantially amorphous contacting the filament with water at a temperature of at least about 92 C for at least about 3 seconds, the filament during said contacting being allowed to contract in its lengthwise dimension or being kept at constant length or being extended slowly and at low tension so that the percent void of the filament is increased. In the process of the invention the hollow filament may be and preferably is extended slowly and at low tension in its lengthwise direction while in contact with the water. If the filament is extended lengthwise while in contact with the water, the amount of extension may be many times the original length. The slow extension at low tension produces little, if any, orientation. The now distended filament may then be drawn in a conventional manner, i. e., at high speed and under high tension to orient the filament. This conventional drawing may take place in water at about 92 C or above if desired. The resulting filament has a high void volume percentage, low elongation and high strength. Hollow filaments are an item of commerce and are employed in various products such as filler for sleeping bags, pillows and cold weather clothing. Hollow filaments are also used in the fabric of thermal underwear, in single use diapers and other absorbent materials including bandages, towels, napkins and the like. Hollow filaments are also used in the demineralization of water. In some uses for hollow filaments, such as fillers for thermal insulation, it is advantageous to have the void volume at a relatively high level since the insulation property is enhanced by the additionally entrapped air. In the past, it has been possible to exercise some control over the void volume of hollow filaments by changing the size and shape of the spinneret, i. e., spinning control. It is desirable to be able to have further control over the void volume of a hollow fiber. The present invention provides an improved control over the void volume of hollow filaments produced by melt spinning of a thermoplastic fiber forming polymer. The art discloses forming hollow fibers by melt spinning a polymer through a spinneret having C or V shaped orifices. The open ends of the C or V shaped orifices face a second orifice. Polymer streams spun from the two orifices unite at their edges to form a hollow filament _ see, for example, British Patent 1 160 263. Hollow filaments are also formed by extruding clusters of round or crescent shaped filaments that coalesce to form a hollow filament _ see, for example, British Patent 838 141. The present invention can employ these prior art methods of hollow filament formation, and then subject the filament to the treatment herein described to increase the volume percentage of the void. Filaments freshly spun at low or moderate speeds from molten polyester are amorphous and substantially unoriented. Filaments of polyethylene terephthalate remain in the amorphous state for some time after being cooled to below their crystalline melting point. It has been determined experimentally that polyester filaments are sufficiently crystallized in about seven days after production and that the process of the present invention is substantially less efficient in increasing percentage void volume. Thus the process works best on filaments less than about 7 days old and is preferably practiced with freshly formed filaments. Filaments in their amorphous state may be extended without substantial crystallization or orientation _ see Pace U.S. Patent 2 578 899. The amount of crystallization that occurs while extending a filament of amorphous polyethylene terephthalate depends to some degree on the temperature at which the extension takes place and the presence of plasticizing molecules in the polymer. It has been found that in freshly formed hollow filaments the void volume can be increased, i. e., the filament distended _ extended circumferentially _, while the filament is in the amorphous state if the filament is in contact with moisture at a temperature of at least about 92 C. The percentage void volume can be further increased by use of water under greater than atmospheric pressure and therefore at temperature greater than 100 C, or by use of steam. While the filament is in contact with water at a temperature of at least about 92 C, the filament may be extended lengthwise slowly, at low tension, or the filament can be kept at constant length while in contact with the hot water, or the filament may be allowed to retract in its lenghtwise dimension during the contact with the hot water. In most circumstances the filament should be in contact with the water for about 3 to 75 seconds. Usually the wall thickness of the undrawn hollow filaments that may be treated by the process of this invention is in the range of about 0.001 to about 0.01 mm. Usually such filaments have a denier of about 3 to 35. After the hollow filament has been distended by its treatment with hot moisture, it may then be drawn in the conventional fashion to form an oriented, crystalline, strong filament. Such drawing can take place in hot water if desired. Such drawing is accomplished at higher speeds and higher tension than the previously described filament extension. The drawn filament is, of course, reduced in diameter, but the percent void is unchanged in this step. Embodiments of the process of the invention will now be described by way of Example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In the following examples, which illustrate the invention, all parts and percentages are in parts by weight unless otherwise noted. Hollow copolyester filaments having grooves that extend longitudinally along the outer surface of the filaments were prepared using spinneret capillaries like those illustrated in Fig. 2. The copolyester is an ethylene terephthalate polymer in which 2 weight percent of ethylene 5 sodium sulfo isophthalate has been copolymerized into the polymer chains. One of the spinnerets had 66 holes 66 clusters of capillaries arranged in two concentric circles the other had 99 holes 99 clusters of capillaries in three concentric circles. In Fig. 2, the bases of the roughly triangular capillaries in the cluster lie on the circumference of a circle. The distance between adjacent capillaries along this circumference is 0.0457 mm. The area of each hole in the spinneret was about 0.0122 mm². Part of the product was spun using one spinneret part using the other. All of the yarn was spun at 1200 ypm 1097 mpm with a spinning block temperature of 266 C. The denier per filament of the spun yarn was 7.4 8.2 dtex . The relative viscosity LRV of the polymer of the yarn was 11.3. The term LRV is the ratio at 25 C of the flow times in a capillary viscometer for a solution and solvent. The solution is 4.75 weight percent of polymer in solvent. The solvent is hexafluoroisopropanol containing 100 ppm H₂SO₄. The spun yarn was treated on a draw machine equipped with feed rolls, draw rolls and two hot water baths. The yarn was extended 1.6X, without orientation in a boiling water about 100 C bath at a tension below 0.1 g per denier 0.09 gram per dtex . The yarn was then drawn 3.75X at normal tension, about 2.5 grams per denier 2.25 grams per dtex in a 96 C water bath containing a little yarn finish. The drawn product, having a denier of 1.25 1.9 dtex per filament was then wound to a package. The average percent void vaIues for fibers in the spun yarn yarn prior to treatment and in the drawn product yarn after treatment were determined. The spun yarn percent void was 9.0 the drawn product percent void was 27 . These determinations were made by flotation density as follows A series of solutions of varying density is prepared by combining the appropriate amounts of CCl₄, density 1.60 gm cc, and n heptane, density 0.684 gm cc. Densities of these solutions may be determined accurately by measuring with a hydrometer. The solutions are lined up in order of increasing density. Then the apparent density of a hollow fiber is determined by cutting a short length 100 150 mm of the fiber, tying it into a very loose knot, and immersing it in each of the solutions in turn to determine in which solution the fiber just floats and in which solution it just sinks. The average of these two densities is the apparent density of the fiber. Then percent void in the spun or drawn fiber is Where Polyethylene terephthalate yarns of hollow round filaments were spun at 787 ypm 720 mpm and wound on spools. The spinneret employed has extrusion orifices like that illustrated in Fig. 1 of U.S. Patent 3 924 988 to Hodge. The yarn has 450 filaments with a denier per filament of 16.9 18.8 dtex . The relative viscosity of the yarn polymer was determined as in Example 1, and found to be about 19.5. The percent void of the filaments was measured by flotation density and determined to be 16. A sample of the spun yarn was boiled in water for 60 seconds without longitudinal tension, e. e., it was free to shrink. The yarn developed so much void that the percent void could not be measured in the density liquids. It floated in n heptane which has a density of 0.684 g ml. Thus, percent void was greater than 51 . Another sample of the spun yarn was boiled for 60 seconds while being held at constant length. This sample has a percent void of 44. An additional sample of the spun yarn was treated on a draw machine under conditions similar to those in Example 1. The yarn from the draw machine was taken up at 50 ypm 46 mpm . The yarn was extended 1.72X without orientation in the water at about 100 C. The yarn was in the about 100 C water for about 6 seconds. The yarn was drawn 3.49X in the second water bath, maintained at about 96 C, with orientation. The final drawn product had a percent void of 22 25 as measured by flotation density. Polyethylene terephthalate having a relative viscosity as determined in Example I of 19.5 was spun into round hollow filament yarns at 1000 ypm 914 mpm , using 450 hole spinnerets. The spinneret orifices were the same shape as those of Example II. The filaments, which have a denier of 6.5 7.2 dtex a percent void of 19, and a wall thickness of about 0.0024 mm are extended 1.52X in a 100 C water bath drawn 3.29X in a water bath having a temperature of 95 C and wound up at 41 ypm 37.5 mpm . The drawn product was then mechanically crimped, relaxed for 8 minutes in a hot air oven at 130 C, and cut to 1.5 inch 3.8 cm staple. The crimped, relaxed staple had percent void of 38.5 and a denier per filament of 1.5. Polyethylene terephthalate was spun at 1400 ypm 1280 mpm with a spinning block temperature of 304 C. The yarn polymer had a relative viscosity of 20.4. The filaments have a trilobal cross section, a denier of 6.18 6.87 dtex and a percent void of 9. The spun yarn was passed into a 100 C water bath for about 6 seconds where it was extended longitudinally 1.52X, and then passed into a second water bath at 95 C where it was drawn 3.29X. The yarn was wound up at 41 yards per minute 37.5 mpm . The drawn product has a percent void of 22. After mechanical crimping, the product has a percent void of 14 16 and a final denier per filament of 1.65 1.8 dtex . A copolyester having a relative viscosity of 21.5 is spun into quadrilobal hollow filaments at 1175 ypm 1074 mpm . The copolyester is an ethylene terephthalate containing 5 , by weight, of glutarate units. The filaments had 4 voids, one in each quadrant, a pecent void of 12, denier of 25 dtex of 27.8 and a wall thickness of about 0.010 mm. The hollow fiber was produced by spinning molten polymer through a spinneret of the configuration illustrated in Figure 3. The percent void increased to 29 when the spun yarn was immersed in boiling 100 C water for 6 seconds. Immersion in boiling 100 C water for 60 seconds also resulted in a percent void of 29. The spun yarn was treated in two successive draw baths as follows Items A and C were passed into a water bath for about 4.3 sec. where they were extended longitudinally 1.057X, then passed into a second water bath at 90 C, where they were drawn 2.70X. The yarn was wound up at 33.3 ypm 30.5 mpm , crimped, and relaxed for 10 min. in a hot air oven at 170 C. Item B, from the same supply yarn, was passed into the 100 C water bath for about 7.5 sec., where it was extended longitudinally 1.10X, then passed into a second water bath at 90 C, where it was drawn 2.73X. The yarn was wound up at 20 ypm 18.3 mpm , crimped, and relaxed for 10 min. in a hot air oven at 170 C. A copolyester having a relative viscosity of 16 is spun into quadrilobal, hollow filaments at 1110 ypm 1015 mpm . The filaments had 4 voids, one in each quadrant, a percent void of 28 and a denier of 26.5 dtex of 29.4 . The hollow filaments developed greater than 51 void when immersed in boiling water for 60 seconds. In 98 C water for 6 seconds, the hollow filaments developed 50 void and, in 92 C water for 6 seconds, 34 void. The process of the present invention is carried out on polyester filaments, such as terephthalate polyester filaments, for example polyethylene terephthalate homopolymer filaments copolyesters containing polyethylene terephthalate units and ethylene 5 sodium sulfo isophthalate units or dimethyl glutarate units terpolyesters containing polyethylene terephthalate units, ethylene 5 sodium sulfo isophthalate units, and dimethyl glutarate units, for example a terpolymer containing 2 by weight ethylene 5 sodium sulfo isophthalate units and 3 by weight dimethyl glutarate units.
