# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING ROBOT

## Abstract
With respect to a programmed movement path of a robot moving member 326 301 305 between predetermined teaching coordinate points N, N 1 , it is decided whether or not a coordinate value of the robot moving member in a stopped condition is within a predetermined allowable path range of the programmed path. And when the coordinate value of the robot moving member in the stopped condition is in the allowable path range, the robot 300 is controlled to move from the stopping position toward the next target teaching point.
