# Robot carrier structure with portal wagon movable on rails.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a robot carrier structure consti tuted by a portal wagon 10 movable on rails 12, 13 and supported at its flanks by two carriages 20, 20 each com prising two wheels 21, 22 longitudinally coupled by motion transmission means 25, 28, 30 26, 29, 31 actuated in syn chronism by an electric motor 27 . The two electric motors 27 of the two carriages 20, 20 further are so connected as to constitute an electric axis. Each wheel 21, 22 has a structure adapted to ensure a high adherence to the rail 12, 13 , particularly due to the provision of a pair of rings 45, 46 of elastomeric material engaging the rolling surface 47 of the rail 12, 13 .
