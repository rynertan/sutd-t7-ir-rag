# Digital remote control method.

## Abstract
A digital remote control method in which interference among different devices is eliminated by the use of a custom code 33 and an instruction code 34 . In accordance with the invention, a transmission code 36 is generated com posed of an instruction code 34 and a custom code 33 , with the custom code 33 and instruction code 34 differing in the number of bits contained. The custom code 33 is transmitted prior to the instruction code 34 with an interval 35 there between longer than the intervals 31,32 between adjacent pulses, which intervals define data 0 and 1 .
