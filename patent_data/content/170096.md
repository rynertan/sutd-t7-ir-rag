# Remotely controllable reset mechanism for a vacuum actuated system.

## Abstract
A reset mechanism for a vacuum actuated lockout device that disables a flush valve to prevent flooding of a receptacle includes a solenoid coupled to a reset stem and to a vacuum relief valve built into the reset stem. The solenoid is energized to open the relief valve in a first portion of a reset stroke and is coupled to the reset stem with a lost motion connection for withdrawal of the reset stem in a second portion of the reset stroke, after relief of the vacuum. A circuit is also disclosed for remote control of the reset mechanism.
