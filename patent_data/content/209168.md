## Description
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for electrolytically cleaning metal strands, such as ferrous wires. More particularly it relates to an improved electro pickling process, using alternating current, capable of effecting rapid and essentially complete removal of oxide scale, rust and other undesirable substances from the surface of iron and steel wires. The process can yield extremely clean wire surfaces suitable for subsequent finishing treat ments. The terms ferrous strand as used herein refers to ferrous e.g. steel wire, strip, sheet etc. irrespective of compo sition, length or cross section. The process and apparatus of the invention are however especially suitable for use in the wire industry. The process of this invention is generally applicable to the in line cleaning of ferrous strands of variable carbon con tent, including low carbon, medium carbon and high carbon steel wire with up to more than 1 C. The process is parti cularly suitable for use in wire pickling lines and can be applied with surprising and advantageous results to carbon steel wires with more than 0.30 C, and especially above 0.45 0.50 C. In the case of steel wire manufacturing the undesirable sub stances found on the wire surface frequently take the form of higher oxides such as ferric and magnetic oxides , hydro oxides rust and also foreign impurities such as dirt par ticles, lubricant residues, organic or inorganic matter, and often also carbonaceous and graphitic substances derived from burnt lubricant. Due to the diversity of character of these contaminants, related to the diversity of prior mill operations and the types of wire used, it is often necessary to subject the wire surface to a sequence of cleaning and pickling steps in order to ensure proper cleaning. For removing adherent scales and subsurface penetrated oxide particles, it is sometimes necessary to treat steel wires in strong mineral acids and to increase both pickling temperature and residence time. These prior art measures increase the cleaning cost with the need for long processing installations and high consumption of chemicals and energy. The use of an electrical current to intensify the cleaning action of a chemical pickling bath has been proposed. How ever, in methods making use of strong acids and employing electrolyzing current assists to accelerate the pickling process, there are often problems of overpickling, including significant loss of base metal, and also hydrogen embrittle ment which is most undesirable in high strength applications of carbon steel wires. To overcome some of the drawbacks of prior art pickling methods, a number of specific electrolytic processes have been developed in which a direct current is applied to the steel wires, mostly in combination with specific electrolyte conditions. Known processes of this type include for example electrolytic D.C. pickling of steel wires in hydro chloric acid solutions under carefully controlled electroytic conditions. bipolar pickling of high carbon steel wires in strong sulfuric acid solution 450 500 g l of H₂SO₄ at a temperature of below 30 C with high current density 150 A dm² . electrolytic D.C. pickling in aqueous salt solutions sulfates, chlorides of sufficient conductivity. In the case of D.C. pickling, however, there is the dis advantage that expensive rectifying equipment is needed and also there is usually requirement for a delicate balance of electrolytic processing conditions polarity, electrolyte temperature, electrolyte composition, etc. . A further disadvantage of direct current pickling of fer rous wire in hydrochloric acid is chlorine gas formation at the current densities needed to effect adequate clea ning. Consequently, electrolytic pickling of carbon steel wire using D.C. is not generally satisfactory and such methods are not industrially important in comparison to the use of hydrochloric acid solutions in the non elec trolytic chemical pickling of wire. As an alternative to D. C. electrolytic treatments, the use of alternating current has been proposed but prior attempts to use ordinary A.C. mains frequency 50 60 Hertz as a cheap source of electrical power to electrolyze steel wires in a hydrochloric acid pickling solution have been largely unsuccessful. One particularly serious problem with the use of an electrolyzing alternating current in the pickling of medium and high carbon steel wires, e.g. containing at least about 0.30 C and more especially above 0.45 C, is the occurrence of a smut layer on the wire surface. This smut is difficult to remove and gives the wire a dark to black appearance. It is unacceptable because poor adhesion of sur face coatings applied subsequent to said pickling operation may result. The real nature and cause of the smut phenomenon are not yet fully understood overpickling, anodic action and surface oxidation, debris of carbonaceous origin, alloying elements or steel impurities may all play a part but its occurrence imposes severe limits on the applicability of A.C. electrolyzing current in acid cleaning of steel wires, parti cularly medium and high carbon steel wires. Hence, A.C. pickling of medium and high carbon steel wire in HCl solu tions in theory a most attractive process has not been industrially important up to the present time. A primary object of the present invention is to provide an electrolytic pickling process for the treatment of steel wire which utilises an alternating electrolyzing current and which is applicable to steel wires in general including medium and high carbon steel wires to provide wires having surfaces of improved cleannesss and increased reactivity as compared to prior art pickling methods and more especially to provide wires having surfaces free form smut layers as described above. A further object is to provide an economical pickling process utilising alternating current which is suitable for the elec trolytic pickling of steel wires of low, medium and high carbon contents. The present invention is based upon the surprising discovery that the effectiveness of electrolytic cleaning processes utilising alternating current can be improved by the modifi cation of the frequency of the alternating current as com pared with mains frequency 50 60 Hertz and that by means of such modification of the frequency of the alternating current steel wires including such wires having medium and high carbon contents can be treated to provide wire having smut free surfaces of improved cleanness and increased reac tivity as compared to those obtained by prior art pickling methods. According to one feature of the present invention, there is provided a process for the surface cleaning of ferrous and other metal strands by means of an electrochemical pickling method in which the ferrous strand to be cleaned is passed through an electrolytic pickling bath characterised in that the ferrous strand is subjected to the action of a low vol tage alternating current the frequency of which is modified as compared with mains frequency 50 60 Hertz whereby the effectiveness of the cleaning process is improved. In a preferred process the metal strand is continuously con veyed past a plurality of spaced apart electrodes arranged along the path of travel of the strand so that the strand passes in turn within a predetermined close distance of each of the said electrodes, electrolyte being provided in the space between each of the said electrodes and the portion of the strand which is adjacent thereto whereby the strand serves as an intermediate conductor between adjacent elec trodes. According to a further feature of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for use in the surface cleaning of ferrous or other metal strands by a process according to the invention as hereinbefore defined which apparatus com prises at least one electrolytic picking cell which in use con tains the aqueous acid electrolyte conveying and supporting means which in use enable the strand to be passed through the said electrolyte in the electrolytic pickling cell a plurality of spaced apart electrodes arranged along the path of travel of the strand so that in use the strand passes in turn within a predetermined close distance of each of the said electrodes a source of low voltage alternating current for the said electrodes and means for modifying the frequency of the low voltage alternating current supply from the said source as compared with mains frequency 50 60 Hertz whereby in use the effectiveness of the cleaning process is improved. The method of this invention is not restricted to the use of an alternating current with the usual sinusoidal wave form. It also includes the use of modified forms, such as pulsed A.C. current, e.g. with anodic and cathodic current periods of equal length or of dissimilar length, and also the use of A.C. of rectangular shape and other variants. According to one preferred feature of the invention, the alternating current of modified frequency and if desired also modified wave form is combined with a superimposed direct current of predetermined voltage related to the applied current density so as to modify the anodic character of the A.C. pickling system. An appropriate electrolytic bath for high speed A.C. pickling of steel wire preferably comprises an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, the concentration of which can for example vary from less than 100 to more than 250 g l of HCl. The aqueous hydrochloric acid electrolyte usually but not necessarily contains ferrous chloride in variable amounts of up to 150 g l FeCl₂ and preferably less than 140 g l expressed as weight amount of iron ion g l of Fe² . When employing an electrolyte based on hydrochloric acid for per forming the electrolytic pickling of high carbon steel wire of above 0.45 C, the modified frequency for obtaining effective cleaning without formation of smut will be substan tially higher than the mains frequency and will in general be at least 200 Hertz, preferably at least 400 Hertz and more preferablly in the range of from about 500 to 2000 Hertz. A suitable electrolyte composition may thus for example con tain from about 50 to 300 g l of HCl, preferably 100 to 300 g l of HCl, and 0 to 120 g l of Fe² and the electrolytic pickling can in general be operated at an economic tempera ture below 60 65 C using high frequency alternating current as described above to effect smut free, rapid and efficient pickling of high carbon steel wires. When using electrolyte baths different from the aqueous hydrochloric baths described above, e.g. electrolytic baths based on concentrated salt solutions, mixtures of acids and the like, the modification to the alternating current fre quency which is necessary in order to obtain improved effec tiveness of cleaning in accordance with the present invention will vary according to the composition of the electrolytic bath. With the knowledge of the criticality of the alterna ting current frequency, the optimum modified frequency for any particular composition of electrolytic bath can be rea dily determined. for example, with electrolytic baths based upon aqueous solutions of Na₂SO₄ or K₂SO₄ or mixtures thereof the desired frequency has been found to be signifi cantly lower than the mains frequency of 50 60 Hertz and the frequency used preferably does not exceed 10 Hertz. Suitable concentrations of Na₂SO₄ range from 100 to 200 g l at a pH of from 5 to 7. Effective electrolytic A.C. pickling of steel wires in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions is most advantageously car ried out at a low frequency of not more than 5 Hertz. Sui table concentrations of H₂SO₄ are from 100 to 500 g l. The method of the present invention is not restricted to the above mentioned electrolytes. NaCl, KCl or mixtures thereof, mineral acid mixtures e.g. HCl H₂SO₄, HCl HNO₃ and various acid salt mixtures may also be used and the optimum modified frequency determined by simple experiment. Suitable current densities in electrochemical pickling sys tems according to the invention are from 25 to 500 A dm² of submerged wire surface. The rapid and unexpectedly efficient cleaning action together with the total absence of pickling smut on the surface of in particular medium and high carbon steel wires, obtainable by subjecting said wires to the A.C. pickling method of this invention, in particular in the presence of aqueous hydro chloric acid electrolytes, is most surprising in the light of the prior art practice and knowledge, which generally teaches that A.C. pickling of ferrous wires is less effective and that A.C. pickling of high carbon steel wires results in unavoidable smut formation. In one preferred emboidment of this invention, steel wires are electrolytically cleaned by passing one or more wires parallel in a preferably horizontal plane through an elec trolytic bath past a sequence of immersed electrodes and subjecting said wires to an alternating current of modified frequency, preferably by the method of non contact current flow whereby the wires act as intermediate conductors between adjacent electrodes of opposite polarity which are serially arranged, at a preset close distance from the wire, in the longitudinal bath direction and connected to the terminals of a suitable low voltage A.C. power supply of the desired modified frequency. In one particularly preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, the electrolytic processing zone of the pick ling apparatus is designed as a single overflow bath divided into a plurality of successive electrolytic cells with cont nuous circulation of electrolyte, each of said cells contai ning a plate electrode on its bottom and separated from the adjacent cell containing a similar plate electrode of oppo site polarity by partition means disposed in said bath transverse to the wire travel and longitudinal cell direc tion. The partitions prevent undesirable direct flow of A.C. between adjacent electrodes and cause the current to be con ducted via the moving wires. In addition they can act as supporting elements for the spaced apart travelling wires so as to maintain the immersed wires at the required distance from the electrodes. Electrolyte flow is maintained by sui table pumping means for supplying and circulating the elec trolyte from a central tank to the electrolytic cells, from which the electrolyte overflow returns to the tank. The electrolytic cells may advantageously comprise a one bath integrated construction containing the required number of distinct electrode compartments forming a sequence of spaced apart electrodes, past which the immersed wires are conti nuously moved so as to be effectively electrolyzed over the available treatment length. An alternative apparatus arrangement comprises a sequence of separate overflow cells or baths whereby each bath contains one or more spaced apart electrodes suitably connected to their corresponding A.C. power terminal, e.g. a sequence of single electrode cells or a sequence of separate baths each containing two or more spaced apart electrodes. In this appa ratus arrangement only the moving wires form a continuous conduction path between adjacent baths thereby excluding current leakage between electrodes of adjacent cells. In case of a line stop or a wire stop e.g. incidental wire break , however, the non immersed wire portions are readily oxidized and may even heat up, giving a burnt surface. There fore, in multiwire operations, a one bath multi cell appara tus providing entire wire immersion over the total pickling length is most preferred. In one particularly preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention as described above, means are provided for supplying a single phase low voltage alternating current of specified frequency. The supply conveniently comprises means for stepping down the mains voltage to a required low voltage and means for converting the mains fre quency so as to generate an alternating current of the desired modified frequency in a desired wave form and also means for regulating the current density. In addition means for supplying a predetermined low voltage D.C. to the wires may be provided whereby said auxiliary D.C. is superimposed on the main A.C. power supply so as to change the active electrolyzing voltage and or wave form of the applied A.C. in a desired way. According to our findings, the pickling results for steel wires subjected to a modified high frequency as hereinbefore described in a hydrochloric acid electrolyte are further unexpectedly improved by cathodic superposition of a D.C. voltage, which may vary in height in relation to the ampli tude of the applied A.C. voltage and is preferably adapted to attain a fraction of the peak height of said A.C. voltage in a specified range 0.05 to 0.50. Said cathodic super position of suitable intensity presumably reduces or compen sates the possibly harmful effect of a too active anodic period depending on actual system electrolytic equilibrium by a controlled extension of the cathodic period relative to the anodic period of the A.C. cycle. Said cathodic shift may amount to 50 of the peak height of the applied A.C. voltage. A preferred range in A.C. pickling of steel wire in HCl is selected as follows in accordance with applied current density These and other aspects of the invention will be more fully understood by reference to the accompanying drawings and the examples which show the results of a selection of pickling treatments as applied to steel wires including high carbon steel wires containing 0.70 to 0.85 C. References in the text to degree of pickling refer to the following scale, where a series of standard conditions are used to obtain samples of pickled high carbon steel wires for comparison. Ferrous chloride FeCl₂ content is always expressed as a weight amount of ferrous ion g l of Fe² . Referring to the drawings, Figures 1 to 5 summarize some of the pickling results obtained by performing the method of the present invention on steel wire. Figures 6 to 9 schema tize apparatus embodiments suitable for carrying out the method of this invention. Drawn steel wire of 0.70 C and 1.5 mm diameter was first isothermally transformed lead patenting to pearlite and stored in ambient air for different times up to 6 months. The wire surface contained higher oxides, rust and small residues of burnt lubricant in varying amounts. The wires were immersed in a hydrochloric acid bath of 180 g l of HCl at a temperature of about 60 65 C and pickled in different ways The pickling results were as follows Example 1 clearly demonstrates that high frequency pickling of high carbon steel wires in HCl in accordance with the present invention gives a considerable improvement in cleaning capability and wire surface purity as compared to conventional chemical pickling and to electrolytic A.C. pickling at mains frequency. This example illustrates a specific embodiment of the method of this invention wherein a combination of low frequencies outside the mains frequency range and a particular electrolyte are used. Electrolytic pickling of 0.70 C patented steel wire in sodium sulphate solution 150 g l of Na₂SO₄, immersion time of 5 seconds, temperature of 40 C, current density of 100 A dm². Lead annealed drawn low carbon steel wires 0.15 C 2.4 mm containing oxide scale and partially carbonized lubricant residue on their surfaces were subjected to comparative pickling treatments The pickling results were as follows Surface cleanliness obtainable by the method of this inven tion is clearly superior. The method of this invention is thus suitable for the pickling of low carbon steel wire, though with less spectacular results than obtainable on high carbon steel wires. In a second series of tests the process of the invention was tested more systematically on high carbon steel wires, in particular the high carbon range 0.50 1.0 C which covers most steel grades for high performance applications. Said carbon steel wires are generally prone to smut formation on pickling in hydrochloric acid solutions and require careful pickling conditions to obtain adequate surface cleanliness. Activation of the pickling process with normal A.C. mains frequency unavoidably causes black smut and surface dete rioration. Therefore, a most important object of the present invention was to solve this persistent problem. Further objects were to improve the surface treatment of steel wires with regard to pickling speed, reliability and ultimate degree of cleanliness as compared to the present limits of conventional chemical pickling in HCl. Patented 0.80 C steel wire of 1.25 mm diameter normally has a black oxidized surface. Conventional pickling in a hydrochloric acid bath usually attains a degree of pickling of about 3 3.5 grey to light dark grey surface in the best conditions, referring to a two bath system precleaning HCl bath followed by desmutting bath of increased HCl concen trations up to 250 300 g l a degree of pickling of 2 3 is obtainable with total immersion times of about 15 20 seconds and bath temperatures of 60 70 C. The wires were treated according to the electropickling method of this invention at a specified high frequency above 200 Hertz, more particularly in the range 250 to 5000 Hertz in which the preferred working range was from 500 to 1500 Hertz. A.C. current density applied to the wires was varied from about 50 to 500 A dm² in an aqueous acid electrolyte containing from 100 to 300 g l of HCl and up to 140 g l of FeCl₂. Excellent pickling results significantly better than degree 3 were obtained in the following conditions frequency 1000 Hertz, current density 100 to 200 A dm² pickling bath 150 to 250 g l of HCl, up to 50 g l of FeCl₂ temperature 40 to 60 C. A really outstanding surface cleanliness, comparable to degree 2 light iron grey and mostly better silver grey to white , hitherto unachievable with conventional HCl pickling, was consistently obtained in a short time of 8 to 10 seconds by treating the wires at 1000 Hertz and 200 A dm² in a pickling bath containing 200 g l of HCl at 45 C or 150 g l at 60 C with an optional amount of FeCl₂ usually 20 40 g l which may rise to about 100 g l without affecting sur face purity. Drawn 0.65 C steel wire of 1.50 mm diameter was alkaline degreased and lead annealed at 450 C, leaving oxide and burnt lubricant residues on the wire surface. Conventional high speed in line pickling for about 3.5 4 seconds in a hydro chloric acid bath 200 250 g l of HCl 40 60 g l of FeCl₂ at 60 C gives a degree of pickling of at best 3 whereby the wire surface has an irregular lustrous aspect. The same wire material was subjected to electrolytic pickling in an aqueous electrolyte of 200 g l HCl 40 g l FeCl₂ at 45 and 60 C with an A.C. current of 1000 Hertz and 150 200 A dm². In these conditions a surface cleanliness of 2 to 3 was reliably achievable in 2 to 3 seconds in addition the wire surface showed a uniform satin grey aspect pointing to an improved and regular surface reactivity which is more beneficial for subsequent finishing than conventionally pickled wire. To further improve cleaning efficiency and surface quality achievable by performing the method of this invention the applied electrolyzing A.C. of specified frequency may be combined with a superposed D.C. A cathodic D.C. voltage of suitable magnitude was applied to a typical A.C. hydrochloric acid pickling system according to the invention. The magnitude of the cathodic shift may vary, but is prefe rably related to the amplitude of the applied A.C. current cycle in a way so as to encompass a predetermined fraction of the peak voltage value of applied A.C. At 1000 Hertz we found the following values Fig.4 to be satisfactory for said cathodic superposition when pickling steel wire in a HCl bath containing 150 to 250 g l of HCl and up to 140 g l of FeCl₂ with a basic A.C having a den sity of 100 to 200 A dm² 100 A dm² cathodic shift corresponding to about 1 50 to 1 6 of total A.C. voltage with optimum improvement range of 1 20 to 1 8. 150 A dm² cathodic shift corrresponding to about 1 20 to 1 5 of total range, and most preferable range of 1 15 to 1 6. 200 A dm² cathodic shift corresponding to about 1 15 to 1 3 of total voltage and most preferably 1 8 to 1 4. As a result of said optimum cathodic superposition we were able to obtain a significant additional improvement in sur face cleanliness often amounting to about one unit on the comparative degree of pickling scale. The achievable degree of pickling often corresponds to the maximum value of surface purity value 1 of the degree of pickling scale as illus trated in Fig. 5, in particular for high carbon steel wire pickled at 1000 Hz in a solution of 200 g l of HCl with varying FeCl₂ content. The process and apparatus of the present invention may also be used for the electrochemical pickling of strands other than ferrous strands. Examples of other metals to which the invention can be applied include non ferrous metals for instance aluminium and non ferrous alloys for instance nickel based heat resistant alloys .
