## Abstract
Organic compounds susceptible to hydrolysis are pre pared by reaction in a water immiscible organic liquid in contact with an enzyme activated with water to catalyse the reaction and desiccant means to lower the water activity of the dispersion from which the reaction products are reco vered. The enzyme may be a lipase to catalyse an interester ification process and the desiccant means may be immersed in the dispersion to remove water in the liquid phase or in the headspace above the dispersion to remove water vapour.
