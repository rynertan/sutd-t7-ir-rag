Patent No. 1,128,234 and Belgian PatentNo.846,397. 10 . A process for preparing a compound of the formula VII which comprises i the reaction of a compound of the formula VIII EMI3.1 wherein L is a leaving group, with the appropriately substituted phenol of the formula IX EMI3.2 wherein R12 and R13 are as hereinbefore defined, i the reaction of a compound of the formula CX EMI3.3 wherein Z is a hydroxy or disubstituted amino group or a halogen atom and R12 and R13 are as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula XI EMI4.1 wherein Y is a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkylthio, aralkylthio or mercapto group, and then, in the case where Y is an alkylthio or aralkylthio group, removing this group by hydrogenolysis, iii cleaving a group R14, wherein R14 is a protecting group as hereinbefore defined, from a compound of the formula XII EMI4.2 wherein R12, R13 are as hereinbefore defined, iv the reaction of a compound of the formula XIII EMI4.3 intermediates in the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds they were not themselves disclosed as having any pharmacological activity. It has now been found that a group of compounds 7 9 within the formula V wherein R and R are the same or different C24 alkyl groups are extremely active in vitro and in vivo against the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, Many of the compounds within this group are more than twice as active in vivo as trimethoprim against these Nesseria organisms and in some cases they are as much as 15 times more active than trimethoprini in vitro. This discovery has extremely important implications in the field of hyman therapy in view of the recent discovery New Scientis, 28th April 1977 pp. 202, 205 of penicillin resistant strain of Neisseria. Penicillins have previously been widely used in the treatment ofNeisseria. These compounds are also useful and effective in the treatment of infections in mammals caused by anaerobic microorganisms such as species of Bacteroides,Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, andClostridium, for example Bacteroides fragilis,B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, C. tetani, C. sphenoides, and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Pathological conditions caused by these microorganisms include sepis of deep wounds such as those due to trauma, e.g. deep puncture wounds, and post operative infection. Accordingly, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprises a compound of the formula VI EMI6.1 wherein R10 and R11, which may be the same or different, are C24 alkyl groups, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. The alkyl groups R10 and R11 may be either straight or branched chain alkyl groups. R10 and R11 may therefore be ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, s butyl, i butyl or t butyl. It has been found that those compounds of the formula VI wherein R10 Rll are branched chain C24 alkyl groups are less readily metabolised in vivo than those compounds wherein R10 and R11 are straightchain alkyl groups. Accordingly, R10 and R11 are preferably the same or different branched chain C24 alkyl groups, that is to say i propyl, s butyl, i butyl or t butyl. Preferably R10 and R11 are the same. Therefore preferred compounds for inclusion within the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include i 2,4 Diamino 5 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine ii 2,4 Diamino 5 3,5 di s butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine iii 2,4 Diamino 5 3,5 di i butyl 4 hydrox benzyl pyrimidine iv 2,4 Diamino 4 hydroxy 3,5 di i propyl benzyl pyrimidine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

In the treatment of infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms the compounds of formula and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered orally, parenterally or as a supposit in the appropriate pharmaceutical formulations and and at the dose ranges described above. The compounds of formula VI and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered alone or in combination with sulionamides as indicated above, The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will be prepared by the admixture of a compound of the formula VI with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other active ingredients, such as a sulphonamide, or conventional pharmaceutical excipients may be admixed as required. Still another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating bacterial infections in mammals by the administration of an effective non toxic antibacterial amount ofa compound of the formula VI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a composition as hereinbefore described. As indicated above, the compounds of the formula VI are generally useful in treating such infections by topical application or by oral administration or injection. The compounds of the formula CVI are normally administered at a dose of from lmg kg to 30mg kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 25 to lOOOmg day and preferably 50 to 300mg day. The compounds of the formula VII and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared by several routes. Thus the compounds may be prepared by i the method described in U.K. Patent No. 1,413, 471 which comprises reacting a compound of the formula VIII EMI15.1 wherein L is a leaving group, with the appropriately substituted phenol of the formula IX EMI15.2 wherein Rl2 and R13 are as hereinbefore defined. Suitable leaving groups L include hydroxy groups, halogen atoms such as bromine and chlorine and the anionic residue of a carboxylic or sulphonic acid for example methane sulphonic acid or toluene p sulphonic acid. Other suitable leaving groups not exemplified in U.K. Patent No. 1413471 include amino groups, preferably di Cl 6 alkylamino groups. This reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a strong acid catalyst such as a strong mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, or a carboxylic or sulphonic acid ii a method similar to that described in U.K.Patent Nos. 1,128,234 and 1,401,612 which comprises reacting a compound of the formula CX EMI16.1 wherein Z is a hydroxy or di substituted amino group or z halogen atom and R12 and R13 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of the formula CXI EMI16.2 wherein Y is a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkylthio, aralkylthio or mercapto group, and then, in the case where Y is an alkylthio or aralkylthio group, removing this group by hydrogenolysis. Suitably Z is a dialkylamino or cyclic amino group containing up to 10 carbon atoms, a dimethylamino group is particularly convenient. The reaction will be carried out in the presence of base under conditions well known to those skilled in the art ofMannich reactions. It has been found that the reaction may suitably be carried out in the presence of an alkoxide ion such as methoxide ion at an elevated temperature, suitably between 100 and 2000C in a solvent having a suitably high boiling point, for example a glycol such as ethylene glycol The dethiation is suitably carried out by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a transition metal catalyst Raney nickel is particularly suitable for this purpose.This reaction will be carried out in a polar solvent, for example a C14 alkanol such as methanol or ethanol iii cleaving a group R14, wherein R14 is a protecting group, from a compound of the formula XII EMI18.1 wherein R12, R13 and R14 are as hereinbefore defined.By the term protecting group11 is meant protecting groups conventionally used in the art to block free hydroxy groups, such as C17 acyl groups, for example acetyl and benzoyl, acetal and ketal groups, such as tetrahydropyranyl, 2 methoxyethoxymethyl and methoxymethyl, and aralkyl groups, for example benzyl, phenylethyl and naphthylmethyl, and unconventional protecting groups, such as C14 alkyl groups which may be cleaved from the compounds of the formula CXII .The reaction conditions will be those commonly used in removing protecting groups from hydroxy groups i.e mild acid hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis will be used for removing aralkyl groups, basic hydrolysis will be used for removing acyl groups and acid hydrolysis will be used for removing alkyl groups.Thus U.Xt Patent No.1, 261 455 describes cleaving the benzyl group from 2,4 diamino 5 p benzyloxybenzyl pyrimidine by hydrogenolysis and US. Patent No. 3,684,810 describes cleaving a methyl group from the 4 position of the benzyl ring of 2,4 diamino 5 3,4,5 trimethoxybenzyl pyrimidine by acid hydrolysis iv the reaction of a compound of the formula XIII EMI19.1 wherein R15 is a leaving group or amino group andR12 and R13 are as hereinbefore defined, except that both the groups R15 may not be amino groups, and 016 is a hydrogen or halogen atom, with an aminating agent such as ammonia and thereafter, when R16 is a halogen atom removing this by catalytic hydrogenolysis.Suitably R15 is a halogen atom, such as a chlorine or bromine atom and X16 is a chlorine or bromine atom.The aminating agent is suitably ammonia and the reaction will be carried out under the reaction conditions described in U.K. Patent Nos. 957797 and 1,132,082. The reduction of R16 when this is halogen will suitably be carried out by hydrogenolysis under the conditions described in Belgian Patent No.798724 v the reaction of guanidine as a guanidine salt with a compound of the formula XIV or XV EMI20.1 or its corresponding benzal isomer wherein R17 is a lower alkyl group, R18 is an amino or mono or disubstituted amino group or an alkoxy group, R19 is a formyl or alkoxycarbonyl group and R12 and R13 are as herein before defined.Suitably R17 is a C1 4 alkyl group and R18 is a C1 4 alkoxy group or an amino, C1 4 alkylamino, benzylamino, di C1 4 alkylamino, naphthylamino, optionally substituted anilino piperidino or morphilino group. Preferably R18 is a methoxy, ethoxy, anilino or morpholino group. When Rl9 is hydrogen, the guanidine will be in the form of a guanidine salt whilst when R19 is formyl or alkoxycarbonyl group it is unsalted. The intermediates of the formulae X , XII , XIV and XV and certain intermediates of the formula XIII are novel and as such form an important further aspect of the present invention. The intermediates of the formula XIII are novel with the exception of those wherein R12 and R12 are both ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl. The compounds of the formula XII may be prepared by any of the methods described in U.K PatentNo. 1,375,162 and the compounds of the formulae XIRr and XV may conveniently be prepared by the removal of a protecting group R20 from the corresponding compounds of the formulae XVI and CXWII EMI21.1 EMI22.1 XVII and or its corresponding benzal isomer wherein R10, R11, R1 7, 18 and R19 are as hereinbefore defined and R20 is a protecting group.Suitable groups R20 are those described in ProtectiveGroups in Organic Chemistry Ed. J.F.W.McOmine, PlenumPress, London, 1973 and which are stable to alkaline conditions such as those removable by acid hydrolysis, such as acetal and ketal groups, and those removable by hydrogenolysis, such as aralkyl groups. Thus most suitably R20 is a benzyl, naphthylmethyl or phenylethyl group or a tetrhydropyranyl, methoxymethyl or 2 methoxyethoxymethyl group and preferably R20 is a benzyl or a methoxymethyl or 2 methoxyethoxymethyl group. The hydrogenolysis will suitably be carried out in a solvent such as an alkanol, for example methanol or ethano3, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, palladium is particularly suitable, especially palladium on charcoal, at a temperature of between 0 and 800C, and conveniently at room temperature. The compounds of the formula XVI and NVII may conveniently be prepared from a substituted benzaldehyde of the formula XVIII EMI23.1 wherein R10, R11 and R20 are as hereinbefore defined, under the reaction conditions described for the preparation of structural analogues of compounds of the formula XVI and XVII described in U.K.Patent Nos. 957,797, 1,142,654, 1,133,766, 1,261, 455 and 1,375,162. The known compounds included within the scope of formula VI may be prepared in an analogues manner to the novel compounds of the formula CVII . The following examples are to illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention and their pharmaceutical properties. Antigonococca Activity of 2,4 diamino 3,5 di alkyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidines The antigonococcal activity of 2,4 diamino ,5 diethyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine Ccompound 1 , 2,4 diamino 4 hydroxy 3,5, di n propylbenzyl pyrimidine compound 2 , 2,4 diamino 3 ethyl 4 hydroxy 5 n propylbenzyl pyrimidine compound 3 ,24 diamino 4 hydroxy 3,5 di i propylbenzyl pyrimidine compound 4 and 2,4 diamino 3,5 di t tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine compound 5 and the antimeningococcal activity of compounds 2,3 and 4 were determined in mice by the following methods.The activities were measured against 17 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 5 strains of Neisseria meningitidis in Welicotest Sensitivity Test Agar supplemented with 5 heated horse blood and 5 unheated lysed horse bloodyIn practice, 5 blood was added to 500 ml quantities of the medium at 56 C and, after being placed in a 800C water bath for 15 minutes and then cooled to 56 0C, the lysed blood and the test compounds were added. The medium was then immediately poured into plates. The test compounds were dissolved as the isothionates. In the Screening Examination, which consisted of 6 separate tests, the minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC s ere determined in one third interval dilutions and then reexamined in one half interal dilution. The inoculum in the Screening Examination was from an 18 hour Mueller Hinton heated blood broth culture, and applied with a lmm loop which was streaked along lcm. Because the amount of growth produced by the strains varied, the inocula was not constant in these tests, in the Repeat Examinaticn, the inocula were standardised to give just confluent growth. The MIC s were read as that concentration which produced 90 or more inhibition of growth as compared macroscopically with that of the control growth. The incubation period for the ScreeningExamination was 24 hours and for the Repeat Examination 48 hours. As standards, Escherichia coll CCN 314 and trimethoprim TMP were included in each testt The results are shown in Table 1. Using the above method the activities of compound 5 was mcasured against the same 17 strains of Neisseria norrhoeae and 5 strains of Neisseria meningitidis in Difco G.C. Agar. Also shown in Table 1 is the concentration of each of the compounds in the blood urine and tissues of mice after oral administration. These concent rations were determined as described hereafter.The compounds, suspended in O.10b methylcellulose, were administered by stomach tube to groups of 3 mice, the dose was 2.0mg per 20g mouse and blood was collected from the orbital sinus at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the dosing. Urine was collected directly from each animal at the 4th hour, after which the animals were killed. Liver, lung, brain and muscle was taken from each animal and homogenised in an equal volume w v of water in a Polytron Homogenizer. The suspensions were taken to be 1 2 extracts of the tissues. The concentrations of the drugs were determined microbiologically, using Bacillus pumilus, those in the urine determined both before and after 18 hours incubation with Glusalase gluecuronidase and sulfatase .

There was recovered 0.15g of the desired compound, 2,4 diamino 5 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine 17 . Other products were also isolated. NMR and MS confirmed the structures of the product obtained. EXAt2LE 3 2,4 Diamino 5 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine 103 g 0.5mol of 2,6 di t butylphenol was dissolved in 500 ml of EtOH. 310 g of 20 dimethylamine in absolute EtOH was added with stirring at room temperature. Then the solution was chilled to O and 75 g of 37 formaldehyde 0.93 mole was added.Then the solution was allowed to come to room temperature and stirred overnight. Then it was refluxed for 3 hours, cooled, and poured into 2 1. of ice water,On standing, a precipitate formed, which was filtered, and recrystallized from hexane giving a 90 yield of 2,6 di t butyl 4 N,N dimethylaminomethylphenol. 5.6 g 0.05mol of uracil and 13.15 g o.OSmol of 2,6 di t butyl 4 N,N dimethylaminomethylphenol was dissolved in 65 ml. of ethylene glycol. Then 2.7g 0.05mol of sodium methylate was added, The reaction was heated for 6 hours with nitrogen blowing through the reaction, and the dimethylamine released was collected and neutralized in an equivalent amount of aqueous H2SO4 solution. After cooling, 250 ml of water was added, followed by 5,7 ml of glacial acetic acid to pH 4.5. The precipitate was filtered and washed with water and ether, giving 12.98g of 5 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl uracyl 78,7 .TLC and NMR showed that the compound was correct. 11.6g 0.03mol of above compound was chlorinated using 130 ml of phosphorus oxychloride. The reaction was heated for 3 1 2 hours and allowed to cool. Then the solvent was removed, and 300 ml of ice water was added. Sodium carbonate was added until the pH was 7.2, and the precipitate was filtered giving 8.04 g, 62.5 yield, of 2,4 dichloro 5 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine. NMR confirmed the structure, and TLC indicated slight impurities. Amination of the above material was done in two separate bomb reactions. The first one used 4.0g 0.011 mol of the above material and 50 ml of saturated ammonia ethanol in a bomb at 1400 for hours.The solvent was removed, and 100 ml of 0,05M NaHC03 solution was added, and the pH adjusted to 8.5. The aqueous layer was extracted with four times 100 ml of chloroform, and the chloroform layer was evaporated. The second amination used 3.77 g O.O10 mol of the dichloropyrimidine, absolute ethanol, and 30 ml of saturated ammonia ethanol solution. The extra ethanol was added to dissolve the compound initially before the reaction started, but the compound was not very soluble in the ethanol. The bomb was heated at 1650 for 8 hours. It was worked up as in Experiment 2, and the two chloroform soluble fractions were purified on a silica gel column using chloroform elution, followed by chloroform methanol, 50 1 and then 25 1 ratio. The fractions corresponding to 2,4 diamiro 5 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl pyrimidine were combined giving 1.72g, 24.79 crude yield, and then recrystallized from methanol to give 1.25g of product. CHN, TLC and NMR confirmed the product.CHN Calc. C 69.48,H 8.59, N 17,06 Found C 69.39, H S.69, N 17.06. M.P. 208 210 C Other products were also isolated from the column. Increasing the temperature of the bomb reaction increased the amount of desired diaminated product.
