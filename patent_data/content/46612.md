# COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN HEAT GENERATING REACTIONS

## Abstract
Compositions capable of exothermic reaction in the condensed state are prepared by pressing a mixture of powders comprising a reactive metal such as titanium, boron carbide and, optionally, carbon e.g., graphite and or lamp black and boron. With moderately fine particle size of boron carbide about 400 mesh , sustainer compositions are formed. With considerably finer particle size of boron carbide about 800 mesh , booster compositions are formed. A preferred composition consists essentially of about 67 to 79 titanium, about 13 to 30 boron carbide, up to about 10 carbon and up to about 10 boron.
