BEAMED ENERGY RADIATION CONTROL METHOD AND APPARATUS,AND PROCESSES AND EQUIPMENT COMPRISING SAID METHODAND APPARATUS RESPECTIVELY The present invention relates to energy beam control and, more particularly, to a new and improved method of and apparatus for the control of beamed energy radiation for use in welding, cutting, drilling, heat treatment or other machining or material processing operations as well as in measurements. In recent times there have been increasingly wide spreaded uses of energy beams, e.g.electron beams, iron beams, plasma beams or laser beams in the fields of machining, processing and measurerert arts. In these applications it has become apparent that it is desirable to pulse beamed energy radiaticr and also to control the energy flow being radiated onto a workpiece, precisely depending upon the particular operation to be performed thereon.While various control devices have hitherto been proposed and put into practical use for a beam gun and a power supply therefor, these devices have been found to be either highly sophisticated in structure or unsatisfactory in precisely controlling the energy flow onto the workpiece in a particular desired mode. The present invention seeks to provide a novel and improved method which is capable of precisely controlling beamed energy onto a workpiece in a particular mode in a beam radiation system and also to provide a novel and improved beam radiation control apparatus which is relatively simple in construction and capable of the precision control of the beamed energy flow in any particular desired mode.

The invention ama provides, in still another aspect thereof, an apparatus for controlling beamed energy radiation onto a workpiece, which apparatus comprises a bear gun for producing a series of pulsed energy beams for irradiation of the workpiece a power supply operatively associated with said beam gun for producing therein a series of successive, time spaced groups of discrete, timespaced electrical pulses to produce said series of pulsed energy beams from sad a beam gun and means for controlling at least one of the time duration ton of the said electrical pulses, the time interval 7off between the successive electrical pulses, the time duration Ton of said groups and the time intervalToff between the successive grcups and the number r of said electrical pulses in each of said groups, thereby controlling the energy flow by the said pulsed energn beams onto the workpiece. The and other features of the present invention as well as advantages thereof will become more readily apparent from a readng of the following description of certain exemplary embodiments thereof when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a waveform diagram illustrating a basic form of a series of successive, time spaced groups of pulsed energy beams for use in the present invention Fig. 2 is a schematic representation diagrammatically illustrating one form of the apparatus according to the present invention Figs. 3 5 are circuit diagrams illustrating different embodiments of the signal pulse generator for use in a power supply for a beam gun of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention Fig. 6 is a schematic representation diagrammatically illustrating another embodiment of the apparatus according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is another form of the power supply for the beam gun of the apparatus according to the present invention. Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a series of successive time spaced groups of pulsed, time spaced energy beams A according to the present invention. Three groups or trains in the series A are shown and designated by At, A2 and A7. The groups, Al, A2, A , ... are shown 5 having a duration Ton and a time interval Toff between successive groups. Each group Al, A2, A, consists of n time spaced pulsed beams a which are shown as having a duration ron and a time interval toff. The pulsed energy beams a may be beams of electrons, ions, molecules, or plasma or other composite particles, or a laser.It is seen that all beams a in each group have an equal or uniform intensity and it should be noted that at least a majority of pulsed beams a in each group Al, A2,A3, ... should advantageously have an equal intensity I. In some energy beam operations, it is desirable that the first one or more pulsed beams a in each group Al, A2, A3, ... have an intensity either greater or smaller than the remainder therein. In Fig. 2, there is shown an electron beam system 10 which embodIes the present invention. The system 10 comprises an evacuated housing 11 which is divided by an apertured rartition 12 into two chambers 13 and 14. These chambers are evacuated by vacuum pumps 15 and 6, respectively. In the lower chamber 14 there is disposed a workpiece 17 for irradiation by a series of a series A of timespaced groups Al, A2, A3, ... of time spaced, pulsed energetic electron beams a as shown in wig. 1.The workpiece 17 is shown as grounded. The workpiece 17 may here be drilled, for instance. Within the upper chamber 13 at a top end thereof there is pri e a source of electrons constituted by a filament electrode 18 and a DC supply 19. The filament electrode 18 is heated by the DC supply 19 to emit electrons. The emitted electrons are controlledly extracted and accelerated by a novel power supply 2S to produce a series A of groups of time spaced, pulsed energetic electron beams a according to the present invention.The power supply 20 comprises a DC source 21 connected in series with a switch 22 to the primary winding 23a of a step up transformer 25. The secondary winding 25b of the transformer 23 has one terminal 24 connected via a resistor 25 to the filament electrode 18 and also via a resistor 26 to a Wehnelt electrode 27.The junction 24 of the resistors 25 and 26 is connected via a resistor 28 to ground. The other terminal 29 of the secondary winding 23b of the transformer 23 is also grounded via a diode 30 orientated as shown. The junction 29 of the negative pole of the diode 3C and ground is connected to acceleration electrodes 31 and 32 via resistors 33 and 34 respectively. The resistor 28 is tapped by an adjustable arm 35 which is connected via a resistor 36 to an electrostatic lens electrode 37 disposed between the acceleration electrodes 31 and 32 within the upper chamber 13. In the region of the lower end of the upper chamber 13 there is disposed a beam focusing coil 38 energized by a power supply not shown .The switch 22 in the primary side of the transformer 23 is alternately turned on and off by a pulse generator 39 to pulse the output of the DC source 21. The pulse generator 39 is designed to provide a series of successive, time spaced groups or trains of discrete, time spaced signal pulses of a waveform as shown in Fig. 1 to develop such a series of groups or trains of pulses at the primary winding 23a of the transformer 23. This will cause a series of successive, time spaced groups or trains of discrete, time spaced output pulses of a voltage stepped up to a predetermined value to develop across the junctions 29 and 24 . Ey adjusting the signal pulses at the pulse generator 39, these output voltage pulses a are controlled to have a predetermined duration ron and a predetermined time interval toff.The successive groups or trains Al, AS, A3, ... are controlled to have a predetermined duration Ton and a predetermined time interval or cut off time Toff. The number n of pulses a in each group Al, A2, AD, ... is also controlled. The controlled output voltage pulses are applied between the Wehnelt electrode 27 and the filament electrode 18 and also between the acceleration electrodes 32 and 31, and the Wehnelt electrode 27 so that there are produced in the chamber 13 pulsed energetic electron beams in the form of a series A of successive, time spaced groups or trains Al, A2, AD, ... of pulsed beams a as shown in Fig. 1. The pulsed beams a in each group or train Al, A2, A3, have a controlled duration ron and a controlled time interval toff.The groups or trains Al, A2, A3, in the series A have a controlled duration Ton and a controlled time interval or cut off time Toff. Each grou or train Al, A2, A3, ... ras a controlled number n of pulsed beams a. The iiidal pulsed beam produced is focused through the coii 38 to result in a narrow beam of a controlled diameter which impinges on the workpiece 17 in the chamber 14.The intensity of each pulsed beam i preset through the adjustment of the resistor 25, 8, 3, 34, 36. The pulse generator 39 may be constructed in the form shown in Fig. 3. The pulse generator there shown includes two oscillators 40 and 41. The oscillator 40 produces a series of discrete, timespaced narrow pulses a of an adjustable frequency f as well as a duration ton and an interval roff which are adjustable independently of each other. The oscillator 41 produces a series of time spaced wider pulses A of an adjustable frequency F as well as an on time Ton and an off time Toff which are adjustable independently of each other. The outputs of the oscillators 40 and 41 are combined by an AND gate 42 which thus issues through an amplifier 43 a series of successive, time spaced group or trains A of discrete, time spaced pulses a having controlled parameters son, toff, Ton, Toff, n.The oscillators 40 and 41 may each be constituted by an astable multivibrator of conventional design. An alternative form of the construction of the pulse generator 39 shown in Fig. 4 makes use of the series connection of two oscillators 44 and 45.The oscillator 44 operates at adjustable frequency f to provide switching pulses of adjustable duration ron and interval roff which are applied via an amplifier 46 to the switch 22 Fig. 2 . The oscillator 45 operates at an adjustable frequency F which is lower than the frequency f of the oscillator 44 to provide control pulses of adjustable on time Ton and off time Toff which are applied to the oscillator 44. Accordingly, the switch 22 is operated to turn on and off the DC source 21 Fig. 2 and provides across the primary winding 23a and hence across the junctions 29 and 24 the series A of successive groups or trains of voltage pulses a having controlled parameters ton, toff, Ton, Toff and n. As in Fig. 3, the oscillators 44 may each be constituted by an astable multivibrator of conventional design. Fig. 5 shows another form of the pulse generator 39 which may be employed. In this embodiment, an oscillator 47, e.g. an astable multivibrator, furnishes a uniform series of signal pulses a to an AND gate 48 through the latter s first input terminal 48a. The oscillator 47 has an additional output fed to a counter 49 which is adapted to count an adjustable preset number n of output pulses from the oscillator 47, which number determines the time duration Ton. The counter 49 upon the counting is reset while issuing a trigger signal which is applied to activate a timer 50, e.g.a monostable multivibrator, which determines an adjustable time Toff for groups or trains Al, A2, A5, .... when actuated, the timer 50 provides an inhibit signal to disable the AND gate 48 to pass, and to interrupt, the pulses a to an amplifier 51.The timer 50, upon termination of the time Toff, provides an enable signal to permit the AND gate 48 to pass to pulses a to the amplifier 51. Thus, in this embodiment as well, it wll be seen a series A of successive, time spaced groups Al, A2, A31 ... of discrete, time spaced signal pulses a of adjustable parameters on, off, Ton, Toff, n is applied to the switch 22. shows another embodiment of the present invert on, viz. as applied to a laser system 110. e.g. for machining a workpiece 111 mounted on a worktable 112. A laser gun 113 is pumped or actuated by a flush tube 114 to prode laser beam which is trained towards the workpiece ii. The flush tube 114 is energized by aDC supply 11 which is connected thereto in series with a power switch 116.The latter is turned on and off in response to signal pulses furnished by a pulse generator 39, which may be of any one of the constructions shown in Figs. 3 5, to flush the tube 114 pulsively and in turn to cause the gun 113 to generate pulsed laser beams in the form of S series A of successive, time spaced groups or trainsAl, A2, AD, ... of discrete, time spaced laser beams a Fig 1 which are directed to impinge a given narrow spot on the workpiece 111 supported by the worktable 112. Fig. 7 shows another embodiment of the power supply 20 for energizing a beam gun system as previously described. The power supply 20 in this embodiment includes, as in the arrangement of Fig. 2, a step up transformer 23 having output terminals 24 and 291 at its secondary side with a diode 30 being connected as shown. The primary winding of the transformer 2, is connected in series with a DC source 121 and a switch 122 which is designed to form a variable resistor which provides at the transformer 23 a voltage output whose magnitude is proportional to a control input signal applied thereto from a pulse generator 123. The pulse generator 123 here again includes two oscillators 40 and 41 as previously described, which provide a uniform series of narrow adjustable pulses a and a uniform succession of adjustable wider pulses A.In this embodiment, however, a waveform generating circuit 124 adapted to provide a variable lump voltage waveform in response to the leading edge of each of the pulses produced in the oscillator 41, and also to respond to the trailing edge thereof to terminate the produced lump voltage. The outputs of the oscillator 40 and the waveform generating circuit 124 are tied at a gate 125 whose output is fed via an amplifier 126 to the switch 122. As a result, there develops a series of composite pulses across the output terminals 24 and 29 of the power supply 120, each of the composite pulses having an envelop waveform determined by the circuit 124 and being composed of discrete, short duration pulses a. The beam gun system can be energized by the developed series of these composite pulses to produce a corresponding series of pulsed energy beams for irradiation of a workpiece.
