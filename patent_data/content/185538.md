## Description
THE SYNTHESIS OF INDOLE ALKALOIDS This invention relates to the preparation of the indole alkaloid known as yuehchukene. The indole alkaloid, yuehchukene, with a unique ring structure and potent anti implantation activity has been isolated from the root of Murraya paniculata L. Jack, as disclosed in European Patent Application No.84304243.3. Examination of the structure of yuehchukene has shown that it is a racemate of ll 3 indolyl 7,9, 9ss trimethyl 5ss,8,9,10ss tetrahydroindano 2,3 b indole, of the following formula EMI1.1 The above European Patent Application No.84304243.3 discloses that yuehchukene can be synthesized by a Diels Alder condensation of 3 3 methyl buta 1,3 dienyl indole hereunder MBDI of the following formula EMI2.1 An example is presented in which this intermolecular Diels Alder cyclization is conducted at room temperature in benzene in the presence of silica gel. The resulting slurry is packed into a column which is then rinsed with benzene to yield a fraction containing the desired yuehchukene. In accordance with the present invention in one aspect, an improved intermolecular Diels Alder cyclization process is provided whereby very pure and stable yuehchukene may be obtained in better yield. This improved process is characterized by conducting the cyclization ofMBDI, in solution in an organic solvent, preferably an aprotic solvent such as benzene in the presence of silica gel at elevated temperatures of 60 to 800C. Such conditions give an optimum yield with relatively low yields of side reactions. In one embodiment the reaction is affected under reflux, e.g in benzene typically for 60 min. At the conclusion of the reaction, the product advantageously is purified by reverse phase chromatography to yield a stable product in powder form. Ir. one preferred embodiment the intermolecular cxcl zaticn cf MBDI is conducted in the presence of an acid catalyst which is easily protonised permitting the reaction to be conducted at a lower temperature and for a shorter time typically 68 C, 30 min . A particularly suitable acid catalyst is trifluoroacetic acid but acetic acid and hydrochloric acid could also be used strong mineral acids are not suitable. The product may be purified by normal phase chromatography or by reverse phase chromatography as indicated above. The process of the invention is illustrated by the accompanying flowsheet. EMI4.1 The above European Patent Application No.84304243.3 teaches that the MBDI precursor may be prepared by the aldol condensation of indole 3 carboxyaldehyde with acetone to give 3 3 oxybutylidenyl indole, which uponWittig olefination with methyltriphenylphosphorium bromide gave the desired ABDI. In accordance with another preferred embodiment, the MBDI is prepared from indole 3 carbaldehyde by protecting the nitrogen atom, e.g.with a p toluenesulphonyl group, reaction with theGrignard reagent derived from 3 chloro 2 methyprop l ene, followed by deprotection and dehydration. This process is relatively simple and each step gives a high yield. The present invention is further illustrated by the Examples which follow, Example 1 showing the preparation of MBDI and Examples 2 and 3 the synthesis of vtehchukene therefron.. Example 1 Preparation of MBDIStep I.

To this reaction mixture was added p toluenesulphonyl chloride 42g, 0.11 mole and imidazole lug in dry glyme 50 ml at OOC. The whole was warmed at 600C for 1 hour. After cooling down with ice bath, the grey precipitate thus formed was filtered off and discarded. The filtrate was poured into a saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate 400 ml at OOC.

Example 2 synthesis of yuehchukene by reflux cyclization To 100 g of silica gel 70 230 mesh in 250 ml benzene, 6.5 g of N DI was added and stirred until it was completely dissolved and absorbed on the silica gel. The reaction mature was slowly warmed up to boiling point in 30 min. and kept refluxig for another 60 min. All this while, the reaction mixture was constantly stirred and flushed with argon. At the end of reaction, benzene was ecovered by suction filtration and the silica gel was rinsed exhaustively with diethyl ether until it was white again.The combined filtrate was concentrated to a thick syrup in a rotary evaporator and then loaded on a silica gel column 250 g silica gel, 230 400 mesh, 5 by 20 cm packed in 30 60 petroleum ether diethyl ether 1 1 . The column was eluted with the same solvent under pressure nitrogen with a solvent linear speed of 5 cm min. flash column . The first 650 ml eluate was collected and the residue recovered amounted to 30t of the sample loaded on the column. It was then chromatographed in a Waters PrepLC system 500A unit using a PrepPak 500 C18 column 380 g silica gel C18 and eluted with 80 methanol in water at a flow rate of 150 ml min. A third peak, which was the main peak, leaving the column at a peak retention time of 30 minutes was the yuehchukene peak.For further purification, this peak could be recycled on the same column. Alternatively, it could be collected, concentrated and dried, and then applied to a size B Merck Lobar RP 8 column and eluted with the same solvent 80 methanol in water . Yuehchukene recovered from reverse phase chromatography was first concentrated in a rotary evaporator to remove the methanol, then lyophylised to dryness. TheXfinal product is a light lemon yellow powder. It has the same mass spectrum 70 eV and H nuclear magnetic resonance 90 M IIz spectrum as the pure natural product. Bioassay with mated female rats, dosing by oral route on pregnancy day 1 2 at 2.5 mg kg body weight was 100 active in preventing pregnancy. By the same token, the single day single dose combination is 3 mg kg dosing on pregnancy day 2. Yuehchukene prepared by this process was kept at 200C stored in sealed glass vials and filled with argon.It is stable under these conditions. The flash column yielded 118 of yuehchukene by weight, as estimated by quantitative HPLC. The reverse phase columns 500 C18 leading to RP 8 yielded 5 of near pure yuehchukene by weight from MBDI. It was 97 pure. Example 3 Synthesis of yuehchukene by acid catalysed cycllzation Yuehchukene can be obtained in a similar process as described above in Example 2 with the following modifications. After the MBDI was completely dissolved and absorbed on the silica gel, 1N trifluoracetic acid TFA in benzene was added dropwise to the reaction mixture which was constantly stirred and flushed with argon. The final concentration of TFA in the reaction mixture should reach a molar ratio of MBDI TFA of 25 1. Increasing the molar ratio to 5 1 can increase the yield of yuehchukene but at the same time the complexity of side products, thus rendering purification more difficult and the final yield lower.When the addition of TFA was completed, the reaction mixture was slowly warmed to 650C and maintained at this temperature for 30 min. At the end of reaction, the solvent was recovered by suction filtration and the silica gel was rinsed exhaustively with diethyl ether. The combined filtrate was first partitioned with water, then with 10 KHCO3 in water to remove TFA. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, it was first processed by the flash column as described in Example 2. The flash column eluate containing yuehchukene was further purified by a Fleck Lobar column using 30 60 petroleum ether diethyl ether 1 1 as solvent. Yuehchukene was recovered by removing the solvent in a rotary evaporator and then vacuum pumped to dryness. The final product is a light brown amorphous mass at 108 yield on a weight basis from bED . It has been identified by uv, ir, H nmr and 13C nmr spectra to have the same structure as the pure natural product. It has the same biological potence 100 active at 2.5 mg kg, dosing p.o. on Preg. day 1 2 .Alternatively, the reaction product can be purified by reverse phase chromatography as in Example 2 which yielded yuehchukene in a powder form.
