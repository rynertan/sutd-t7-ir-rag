# Multichamber two compartment electrodialytic water splitter and method of using same for acidification of aqueous soluble salts.

## Abstract
A method for generating an acidified aqueous salt solu tion and an aqueous base in a multichamber two compartment electrodialytic water splitter having a unit cell comprised of a bipolar membrane, a first cation permselective membrane and at least one additional preferably one substantially non por ous, water swollen cation permselective or neutral membrane disposed between a cation face of the bipolar membrane and a face of said first cation membrane forming at least two acid compartments and a base compartment positioned between an anode and a cathode, which comprises the steps of a in troducing a liquid comprising water to a base compartment formed by an anion face of a bipolar membrane and a face of said first cation membrane b introducing a liquid comprising an aqueous soluble salt to at least one additional acid com partment formed by the faces of said first cation membrane and said at least one additional cation or neutral membrane c serially transferring the liquid comprising the aqueous solu ble salt from said additional acid compartment to the first acid compartment formed by a face of said at least one additional cation or neutral membrane and a cation face of a bipolar membrane d passing direct current through said water split ter thereby adding hydrogen ions to the first acid compart ment, transferring hydrogen ions through said at least one ca tion or neutral membrane from the first acid compartment to the said additional acid compartment, metal cations from the acid compartment to the base compartment, and adding hy droxide ions to the liquid comprising water in the base com partment e withdrawing a liquid comprising aqueous base from the base compartment and f withdrawing an acidified aqueous soluble salt from the first acid compartment is dis closed.
