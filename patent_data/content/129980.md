## Description
B1EACEING COMPOSITIONS Frederick Edward Hardy Barry StoddartField of the Invention This invention relates to hypcchlorite bleach ccmpositions and in particular to aqueous hypodhlorite bleachers containing a bactericidal material.Background to the Invention Aqueous bleach ccupositions containing alkali metal hypohalites, particularly sodium hypcchlorite, have been knawn for many years. Because of their powerful oxidising action they have also been acknowledged to be powerful germicides and have been used extensively where this prcperty is beneficial, e.g. in the cleaning of baths, wash basins, flush toilets, drains and ceramic tile floors. However, it has long been recognised that the germicidal effectiveness of surface treatments using such materials is limited by the relatively short period of time during which the aqueous composition containing the hypohalite is in contact with the surface concerned.Recent develcpments in the formulation of hypodhlorite bleach products have shown a trend towards the use of higher viscosities, viz. 100 centistokes or greater, and this will increase the retention of such products on non horizontal surfaces. Nevertheless, the increase in retention time introduced by such a thickened formulation will not be particularly significant, being measured in seconds or at most minutes, and a need exists for a bactericidal and germicidal material that is capable of retention on a target surface for much longer periods. Quaternary ammonium ccupcunds, In general, are knoon to have bactericidal characteristics, and certain water soluble quaternary aitEtotnum surfactants such as cetyl pyridinium bromide are very effective antibacterial agents.Polymeric alkyl siloxane and silane structures are well known as having a high affinity for siliceous surfaces and thus a combination of a quaternary ammonium function and a siloxane or silane grouping might be expected to provide a long lasting antibacterial effect on siliceous surfaces of the type mentioned aboVe Such is indeed the case and the antimicrobial effectiveness of a representative alkoxy silane 3 trimethoxy silyl propyl dimethyl octadecyl ammonium chloride on a variety of surfaces, siliceous, metallic, synthetic, plastic and natural textile in nature, has been reported by A J Isquith et al in J. Applied Microbiology, 24 6 , 1972, pp 859 8K3. However, the incorporation of quaternised alkoxy silanes into aqueous cleaning or bleaching compositions poses considerable difficulty. All alkoxy silanes of this type will I rydrolyse in contact with water, to produce the corresponding silanol derivatives which themselves are prone to polymerisation via condensation of the silanol groups.The polymerised materials are less surface substantive than the parent silanols. In the case of the more water soluble alkoxy Si lanes, containing a C12 C14 alkyl group in the quaternary ammonium portion of the molecule the materials display physical stability in aqueous alkalis and commercial aqueous hypcchlorite and also display surface substantive properties. However, in the presence of hypechlorite stable surfactants, surface substantivity is markedly impaired due to solubilisation into surfactant micelles. Furthermore, these shorter chain alkyl quaterni sed alkoxy Si lanes do not display broad range antibacterial efficacy. Quaternary alkoxy silanes containing an alkyl chain longer than C14 are less water soluble and do not even display long term stability in aqueous alkaline solutions but precipitate therefrom, probably in polymerised, and hence antibacterially ineffective, form. However, it has surprisingly been found that those quaternised alkoxy Si lanes containing a C16 C20 alkyl group can be incorporated into certain aqueous hypochlorite bleach compositions to produce a physically stable product capable of delivering hydrophDbic properties and a long lasting antibacterial effect to siliceous surfaces treated therewith. Aqueous hyoochlorite bleach ccmpositions forming suitable vehicles for the delivery of the quaternised alkoxy silanes should be free or substantially free of anionic surfactants and preferably should have a low ionic strength. Accordingly the present invention provides an aqueous bleaching composition comprising from 0.1 5 by weight of a surfactant selected from amine oxides of formula R4R5R6N O, wherein R4 is a C10 C18 alkyl group and R5 and R6 are C1 C4 alkyl groups, substituted betaines of formula R7R8 R9N R10COO whereinR7 is a C8 C18 alkyl group and R8, and R9 are C1 C4 alkyl groups, and R10 is a C1 C4 alkylene group and mixtures thereof, from 1.0 to 12.0 by weight of an alkali metal hypochlorite and from 1.0 to 15 by weight of inorganic compounds other than hypochlorite, said composition having a FH in the range from 10 to 13, wherein the composition also contains from 0.001 0.25 by weight of an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound of formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1 is C16 C20 alkyl, 2 is 4 alkyl, R3 is C1 C4 alkyl, y is an integer fran 0 to 2, and X is a water soluble anion or the silanol derivative thereof wherein R3 is H wherein the ionic strength of the composition is less than 5.0g moles dm3 and wherein the composition is substantially free of anionic surfactant species. Preferably the composition contains from 0.005 to 0.05 and most preferably from 0.01 to 0.03 of the organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. Preferably R1 is a C18 alkyl group. In highly preferred compositions in accordance with the invention, the viscosity of the composition is at least 200 centipoises at 200C and comprises alkali metal hypochlorite in an amount of fran 8 to 108 by weight, a C14 C15 alkyl dimethyl amine oxide as the only surfactant in an amount of from 1.0 to 1.5 by weight tcgether with at least 400ppm of a secondary or tertiary alcohol as hereinafter defined or the ester thereof with a C2 C3 alkanoic acid, and the composition has an ionic strength of less than 4.0 g moles dm . The above mentioned reference to viscosity is to the dynamic viscosity 7 which is measured by a Brookfield EVT viscometer and for the purposes of this specification measurements are made with Spindle No. 3 at 100 rpm and a liquid temperature of 20 C. Fluid viscosity can also be expressed as the kinematic viscosity J in centistokes as measured by an Ostwald vi scaneter and is characterised by the expression i A where 1is the dynamic viscosity in centipoises and is the density in g cm3. Compositions in accordance with the present invention have a density in the 3 range from 1.10 to 1.25 g cm , typically approximately 1.15 3 g cm , so that the numerical value of the kinematic viscosity in centistokes is slightly less than that of the dynamic viscosity in centipoises. Organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds having the desired combination of broad spectrum antibacterial activity and physico chemical stability in ccanpositions in accordance with the invention have the general structure EMI5.1 wherein RI is C16 C20 alkyl, R2 is C1 C4 alkyl, R3 is C1 C4 alkyl, y is an integer from 0 to 2, and X is a water soluble anion. A preferred chain length for R1 is C18 for antibacterial efficacy reasons, and for reasons of cost and ease of preparation R2 and RI are usually methyl.In aqueous alkaline solution the R30 groups will hydrolyse to give the silanol derivative or, depending on the pH, the corresponding zwitterion, so that references herein to the organic silicon quaternary ammonium compound include the silanol derivative thereof. X is normally halide, particularly chlorIde, but can also include methosulphate, acetate or phosphate. The level of incorporation of the organosilicon compound is from 0.001 to 0.25 based on the total weight of the composition but is more usually in the range of from 0.005 to 0.05 and most preferably from 0.01 to 0.03 by weight. In compositions in accordance with the invention, the hypochlorite bleach, and the alkali metal chloride and chlorate salts which acscrçeny it in commercially available materIal, provide the majority and preferably substantially all of the ionic strength requirement. This will normally result in an ionic strength of at least 3.0 g moles dm3. Ionic strength values in excess of 5.0 g moles dm3 are not desirable beacuse of their adverse influence on the stability of both the hypochlorite and organosi licon quaternary ammonium compound catoonents. Preferably the ionic strength is less than 4.0 g moles dm and values in the region of 3.4 3.8 g moles dm are considered to be optimum where a stable product of viscosity , 200 centipoises is desired. The alkali metal hypochlorite may be a lithium, potassium or sodium hypochlorite and the level of hypochlorite in the composition is normally arranged to lie in the range 1 12 , preferably 5 108 by weight. Customarily hypochlorite bleach cowpositions contain approximately 6 or 9 hypochlorite by weight. However, the activity of chlorine bleaching compositions is conventionally expressed in terms of the weight percentage of available chlorine in the composition, and the actual weight percentage of bleaching species is arranged to provide the desired level of available chlorine1. The preferred hypochlorite species is sodium hypochlorite which contains 95.3 available chlorine. Alkali metal hypochlorites are commercially available as aqueous solutions containing 10 15 by weight available chlorine and the bulk suppliers normally produce material having available chlorine contents towards the upper end of this range viz. 12 14 by weight. These commercially available hyochlorite solutions contain other salts as byproducts or contaminants, more specifically free alkalinity in the form of alkali metal hydroxide and alkali metal carbonate, and alkali metal chloride.Low levels of other species such as sodium chlorate are also believed to be formed during hypochlorite manufacture but their chemical stability is sufficiently low that they have largely decomposed by the time the hypochlorite is employed in product formulations. The levels of the byproduct materials depend on the processing conditions employed in the manufacture of the hypcchlorite but in general they fall within the ranges 0.2 1.0 alkali metal hydroxide 0.01 0.1 alkali metal carbonate 10.0 18.0 alkali metal chloride expressed as a weight percentage of the hypochlorite solution as supplied. Amine oxides useful in the present invention have the formula R4R5R65 ss0 wherein R4 is a C10 C18 alkyl group and R5 and R6 are C1 C4 alkyl groups.The amine oxide is present in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 , more preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 and,in preferred embodiments of the invention in which the R4 average chain length X 14 carbon atoms, from 1 to 1.5 by weight of the composition. The R4 group may be linear or branched and may be derived from natural or synthetic hydrocarbon sources. For the purposes of the present invention linear groups are defined as including pieties incorporating up to 25 methyl branching, predominantly in the 2 position relative to the nitrogen atom of the amine oxide. Methyl branching on the alkyl chain also predominates in those amine oxides useful in the present invention in which the R4 group is branched, rather than linear in nature. Commercially available sources of these amine oxides are normally a mixture ofEMI7.1 where R7 is methyl, and which mixture arises as a result of the processing route used to form the precursor alcohol or aldehyde. This route involves carbonylating or hydroformylating an olefin, preferably a lineard olefin and leads to a mixture of the desired branched chain aldehyde or alcohol of the same carbon number. For olefin starting materials having a range of carbon chain length, the resultant alcohol or aldehyde mixture contains compounds of different carbon number and isomers containing straight chain and 2 alkyl branched chain alkyl groups.A typical commercially available mixture comprises 65 to 75 by weight C13 and 35 to 25 by weightC15 amine oxides with approximately 50 by weight straight chain and 50 by weight alkyl branched chain where the 2 alkyl group is predominantly methyl. These are available from ICI under the trade name Syrprolam 35 DMO as a 30 aqueous solution. The branched chain amine oxides and mixtures thereof with linear chain amine oxides are used at levels towards the upper end of the range viz. 2 by weight of the composition and typically from 2.0t to 2.5 by weight. Although the above described mixture of straight chain and branched chain alkyl dimethyl amine oxides has been found suitable for the purposes of the invention, their use does not constitute the most preferred execution of the invention. This is because a bleaching coNposition containing 8 108 hypochlorite and an amine oxide in which the long chain alkyl group has a carbon number of about 13.3 requires an ionic strength of at least 4.7 g moles dm3 to achieve the preferred product viscosity of at least 200 cp. This level of ionic strength is believed to make the storage stability of the hypochlorite bleach less than that which is considered desirable for the expected shelf life of the product. The preferred amine oxide structure for thickened products having a viscosity of ,200 cp is one in which R4 is a linear group which has an average chain length in the range C14 C15. Compositions containing these preferred amine oxides require a lower amine oxide level viz. 2.0 , more typically 1.0 1.5 and also a lower ionic strength viz.3 0 g moles dm minimum in order to achieve target viscosity. Both of these reductions in ingredient level lead to improved storage stability and also lower the cost of the product. Another hypechlorite stable surfactant suitable for the purposes of the present invention is a substituted betaine of formula R7R8R9N R10COO wherein R7 is a C8 C18 alkyl group, preferably aC10 C14 alkyl group, R8 and Rg are C1 C4 alkyl groups, more preferably methyl groups, and RIo is aC1 C4 alkylene group more preferably a C2 C3 alkylene group. Specific examples include octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl and hexadecyl betaines in which R10 is an ethylene or propylene group and R8 and Rg are methyl groups. Mixtures of hypochlorite stable surfactants are also knows in the art particularly where it is desired to increase the viscosity of the system and examples of other hypolorite stable surfactants include saturated fatty acid soaps, alkyl sulphates, alkane sulphonates, sarcosinates and taurides. These surfactants which are anionic in type should be employed at levels which do not interfere with the efficacy of the quaternised alkoxy silane.Because of the tendency of cationic and anionic surfactant species to react to form high molecular weight, relatively water insoluble complexes, anionic surfactants should be present at less than the amount necessary to complex the quaternised alkoxy silane completely. It has been found that quaternised alkoxy silane deposited on a siliceous surface from compositions in accordance with the invention provides 80 to 90 reduction in bacteria E. Coli count on exposed surfaces when the treated surfaces are subsequently exposed to an innoculum of fresh bacteria in a distilled water environment. However the presence in the composition of anionic surfactants in excess of the amount necessary to complex the quaternised alkoxy silane leads to a significant diminution of the bacteria count reduction under the same conditions. Accordingly, the composition should be substantially free of anionic surfactants, substantially free being defined as less than the amount of surfactant necessary to completely complex the quaterni sed alkoxy silane, and preferably should be completely free of such surfactants. A highly preferred optional component for hypochlorite bleach compositions suitable for incorporating the quaterni sed alkoxy silanes, particularly those utilising from 1.0 to 2.08 of an amine oxide wherein R1 has an average chain length of about 14 carbon atoms, is at least 400 ppm based on the weight of the composition, of at least one secondary or tertiary alcohol selected from cedrol, tetra hydro linalool, tetra hydro muguol a 50 50 mixture of tetra hydro linalool and a positional isomer, tetra hydromyrcenol , verdol, dihydro terpineol, isoborneol, 4 tertiary butyl cyclo hexanol. and menthol and mixtures of any of these or of their hydrolysable C2 C3 carboxylic acid esters.These alcohols and their C2 C3 alkanoic acid esters are knawn and used as ingredients in fragrances, including those employed in detergent compositions. As such their level of incorporation canventionally lies between 10 ppm and 600 ppm of the composition depending on the perfume formulation and the nature of the detergent composition. It has now surprisingly been found that in aqueous hypochlorite bleach solutions containing from 1.0 to 2.0 of a C14 C16 amine oxide as the only surfactant, the incorporation of at least one of the above mentioned secondary or tertiary alcohols or an ester thereof withC2 C3 alkanoic acid provides an enhancement of the viscosity of the bleach solution and facilitates the generation of viscosities of 200 centipoises and greater at 20 C. Preferably the secondary or tertiary alcohol or ester is present in an amount of more than 600 ppm and, where the amine oxide level is 1.5 by weight is more preferably present in an amount of at least 800 ppm.Advantageously a mixture of the alcohols or their C23 alkanoic acid esters is used in a total amount of from 600 to 1600 ppm although it is preferred that one of the components of the mixture should be present in an amount of at least 500 ppm by weight of the composition. The most preferred materials are cedrol, tetrahydro linalool, tetrahydro myrcenol and dihydro terpineol and their acetate esters. These materials have tertiary alcohol functionality and are relatively immune to breakdown in hypochlori te containing solutions, resulting in viscosity enhancement effects which are stable with time. The mode of cperation of these materials in this system is not fully understood but it is hypothesised that in the absence of anionic surfactants, hydrogen bonding occurs between adjacent alcohol functions of the relatively water insoluble alcohols held in the amine oxide micelles. This is believed to lead to the formation of an extended micellar structure in the solution which provides an increased viscosity. The maximum viscosity of the system is not reached immediately upon mixing, but develops over a period of time and accordingly viscosity is measured 24 hours after the product has been made. Thickened aqueous hypochlorite bleach compositions including the above mentioned alcohol derivatives are particularly preferred for the incorporation of the quaternised alkoxy silane antibacterial component as such compositions utilise the minimum amounts of amine oxide surfactant and ionic salts necessary to generate the desired product visoosity and hence enhance the stability of the quaternised alkoxy silanes. As stated hereinbefore, the salts acccttoooying the hypochlorite bleach provide most if not all of the ionisable species necessary for the ionic strength requirement. However, other non surface active organic or inorganic compounds can be added where necessary to provide an ionic strength in the desired range. The ion sable compound s can be inorganic in nature eg.hydroxide, sulphate, halide, particularly chlorIde , carbonate, nitrate, or orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, or polyphosphate, or organic such as formate, acetate or succinate. In the preferred embodiments of the invention inorganic coopunds such as silicates and organic compounds incorporating oxidisable groups are aided because of their tendency to have adverse effects on physical and or chemical stability of the compositions on storage. Certain organic sequestrants such as the amino poly alkylene phosphonates salts can, however, be incorporated in an oxidised form in which they are not susceptible to attack ty the hypochlorite bleach. Such sequestrants are normally present in amounts of from 0.1 to 0.5 by weight of the composition. The ionic strength of the composition is calculated by means of the expressionTotal Ionic Strength I EMI12.1 where Ci is the molar concentration of the ionic 3 species in g moles dm3 Z. is the valency of the species. The function C.Z2. is calculated for each of the ionic 11 species in solution, these functions are summed and divided by two to give the composition ionic strength. The loni sable alkali metal ccepcund normally comprises a caustic alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide either alone or in admixture with alkali metal salts. This gives a composition pH as is of 10 to 13, although in use the pH of the bleaching solution normally has a value in the range from 11 to 12. For product safety reasons the amount of caustic alkali is normally limited to a value in the range of from 0.5 to 2 , more usually from 0.75 to 1.58 by weight of the composition. A desirable optional component of compositions in accordance with the invention is a perfume which is present at a level of from 0.01 to 0.58 preferably from 0.05 to 0.25 by weight of the composition. In the preferred thickened bleach compositions incorporating one or more of the above described secondary or tertiary alcohol components the alcohol component s can conveniently be incorporated in the perfume mixture. A further desirable optional component in compositions in accordance with the invention is an agent for siliceous glaze protection such as zinc oxide, or aluminium oxide and water soluble bismuth salts. This can be added in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.18 by weight of the composition more preferably from 0.028 to 0.06 by weight. The compositions are made by conventional mixing techniques.Because of the relatively low aqueous solubility of the organo silicon compound which is normally supplied as a solution in methanol, a premix of the amine oxide, perfume, added caustic alkali and water is normally prepared and the organo silicon compound is then added with vigorous agitation. This mixture is then added to the hypochlorite solution to make the final product. Other orders of addition can be used but unless the amine oxide is present in the solution to which the organo silicon compound solution is added, problems of incomplete solution or precipitation can arise. The invention is illustrated in the following examples in which percentages are expressed by weight of the composition unless otherwise stated.
