# Athletic shoe with two piece upper forepart section.

## Abstract
An athletic shoe is disclosed. The athletic shoe includes an upper attached to a sole. The upper has a forepart section comprised of an inner layer and an outer layer. The inner layer is preferably formed of relatively thin stretchable leather and the outer layer is formed of a breathable nonstretchable material, such as nylon mesh. A slight gap is formed between the outer surface of the inner layer and the inner surface of the outer layer to allow the inner layer to stretch a limited degree in order to mold to the forepart portion of the foot of the wearer of the shoe.
