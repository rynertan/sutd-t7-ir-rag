## Claims
Bits. 3 and 4 show the accepting element of the device as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, with the contrivances connected thereto depicted in the way in which theg are to be found at the time the panels to be united are locked one to the other, and are parted one from the other, res pectively Fig. 5 shows a second version for the device, with the parts seen from the front Fig. 6 shows the accepting element of the device as ill lustrated in Fig. 5 but in sectional form along the line VILLI thereof Fig. 7 shows a third version for the device, seen from the front, with the peg and the accepting element unat tached from one another, with some parts in sectional form in order that others may be more visible, and with the pawl in the non operative position Fig. 8 shows, from the front, the accepting element of the device as illustrated in Fig. 7, with the pawl placed in the position of engagement with the toothing of the head of the pin belonging to the accepting element, in such a way as to allow the rotation thereof in the same direction as that in which the peg is inserted into the body of the accepting element Fig. 9 shows in part the accepting element of the device illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, the pawl being depicted with a continuous line in the non operative position and with a dotted line for the position as in Fig. 8. The three versions illustrated are all based on one and the same basic characteristic method which is achieved with mechanical contrivances that differ one from the other but are all equivalent. itn reference to Xigs. 1 and 2, and in conformity with Italian Patent Application 12494A, 79, the device in question is provided with a peg 7 that has to be rendered integral by screwing it , cantilever fashion, with a panel 8 , and with the toothing of the said cylindrical heaz and is placed laterally to the pin with the possibility Oj effecting displacement movements with respect thereto in order to allow the pin to only rotate in the same direction in which the peg is inserted in the body of the accepting element, an elastic member which tends to keep the peg engaged with the toothing of the cylindrical head of the pin, being provided. 0vrith a device of this type, irrespective of the position of progressive insertion of the peg into the body of the accepting element, when the pawl is in a position of engagement with the toothing of the head of the pin, the tvio parts cannot come accidentally apart, and a sizable working stroke is available for tightening one panel to the other with the possibility of easily taking up even play of some entity between the parts. Then taking into consideration that the pressure applied manually to tighten thoroughly the panels one to the other, by pressing one against the other, can never ever be as great as the desired maximum, with the device in question the possibility exists of the two parts being ultimately tightened forcibly by the operator with the aid of a screwdriver or spanner used on the head of the pin provided with the sprocket that meshes with the rack, so as to rotate the pin in the direction allowed by the pawl. The characteristics of the invention will now be described better in the description that follows of various preferred forms of embodiment, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the device in a first version, seen from the front, with the units that go to make it up, in an expl oded view I Fig. 2 represents the section along the line II I of the accepting element Ynce the head of the peg has been initially engaged with the said track, the peg is made, by suitably rotating the bush, to gradually penetrate into the inside of the body oi the accepting element, in,order to tighten one panel against the other. Here agaixl the actual movement is very limited, and whilst there is no risk of the panels being thightened unstably one to the other, as in the previous instance, there is the risk that because of play between the parts when endeavour nng to force the tightening to a maximum, the head of the peg may come out o f the spiral track, with the need to repeat the operation and the risk of the grip between the panels. suddenly working loose. The object of the invention is to solve the aforementioned difficulties and, in particular, to make available a device of the stated type, by means of which the parts can be stably intercoupled right from the time when the two panels to be united are placed one at the side of the other. Based on principles that differ completely from those outlined above for coupling a peg to an accepting element, and in conformity with Italian Patent Applications 12494 79 and 3330h 80, priority for which is claimed, essential features of the device in question are that the said peg is provided with a succession of circumferential grooves that define a sort of rack, and that the said accepting element has, perpendicularly to the said seating or hole through which the peg passes, at least one housing and one receding part that commwaicates With the outside and with the seating or hole, inside which is housed a pin with a cylindrical head that is toothed circum2 ereiitially with small, close set, teeth, the shank o the said pin being provided with a sprocket destined to mesh with .he said rack at the time the peg is being inserted into the accerting element, the said device comprising, rthermore, a pawl that meshes

Device for uniting two panels of the type that comprises a cylindrical peg that can be fixed at one extremity to one of the panels, and an accepting element that can be fixed flush in the other panel, provided with a housing or hole through which the said peg can pass, and devices for restraining or hooking it, essential features of which are that according to Italian Patent Application 12494A 79 the said peg is provided with a succession of circumferential grooves 107 that define a sort of rack 207 , and that the said accepting element 9 has perpendicularly to the said housing or hole 109 through which the peg 7 passes, at least one receding part and cylindrical groove 209 309 which communicate with the outside and with the housing or hole 109 inside which is housed a pin 12 with a cylindrical head 112 provided circunferentially with small, close set, teeth, the shank of which carries a sprocket 212 destined to mesh with the rack 207 when the peg 7 is inserted into the accepting element, the said device coinprising, furthermore, a pawl 14 or 16 that meshes with the toothing of the said cylindrical head 112 and is placed laterally to the pin 12 with the possibility of effecting displacements with respect thereto in such a way as to allow the pin to rotate only in the sane direction as tat in which the peg 7 is inserted to the woody cf the accosting element 9 . evice according to Claim 1 essential features of wich are that the pawl 14 or 16 is subjected to the act5on cf flexure of the pin so , passes beyond the dead centre point that coincides with the imaginary line between the axis of rotation of the pawl 14 and the axis of the pin 20 , and allows the former to click into the position illustrated in Twig. 8 and with a broken line in Pig. 9. Just as in the preceding cases, with the panels 8 and 10 placed side by side, it is sufficient to insert the peg 7 into the hole 109 in the accepting element 9 and to force the panels 8 and 10 one against the other, in order to secure one to the other. To separate the panels 8 and 10 , all that has to be done is to move the pawl laterally in the reverse direction to that described above, until the vertex 51a of the cam 414 passes past the said dead centre point and allows the pawl 14 to click into the backward position illustrated in Pig. 7. With the pawl 14 in this position, the pin 12 is free to rotate in the two directions and, therefore, by applying a slight push to the panel 8 , the peg 7 can easily be withdrawn from the accepting element 9 . In accordance with what is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, and in keeping with Italian Patent Application 33304 80, the pawl 14 is pivoted at 214 to the body of the accepting element 9 with the possibility to effect a small angular two way deviation from a position in which it is, at the free extremity thereof, away from the toothing of the said head 112 , to a position in which it is in engagement therewith and vice versa. On one side the pawl 14 has in it an indentation 314 see best Fig. 4 which, together with the lower profile of the same side forums a sort of cam 414 with which engages a flexible pin 20 either integral with the body of the accepting element 9 or else fixed thereto in any way and extending perpendicularly to the plane of the receding part 209 .The position of the pin 20 from the axis of rotation of the pawl 14 is such that the distance 1 of the vertex 514 of the cam away from the said axis is greater than the distance the pin 20 is away therefrom, when measured from a point on the lateral surface thereof located on the imÅaginary line that theoretically connects the axis of rotation of the pawl 14 with the axis of the said pin. The latter is also so positioned that when the pawl is in the position of engagement with the toothing of the head 112 of the pin 12 , it is in forced contact with the lower profile of the said cam 414 see Fig. 8 , and that when the pawl 14 is positioned far away from the said toothing, it is partially housed in the indentation 314 .As regards the operation of the device according to the foregoing method, once the peg 7 and the accepting element 9 have been secured to the relevant panels 8 and 10 , care has to be taken to carry, if it is not there already, the pawl 1 in the position of engagement with the toothing of the head 112 of the pin 12 .This is possible by pressing laterally on to the pawl 14 with a screwdriver or similar, on the sar te side where the pin 2Q is located, iMitll the vertex to14 of the cam 41i , y causing a slight rotate firt ier by means of a screwdriver that can be inserted in the nick 312 provided in the head 112 thereof, in such a way as to bring about an additional brief penetration of the peg 7 into the hole 109 so as to force the panels and leo to tiClten still further. All that has to be done to separate the panels 8 and 10 is to insert a small punch in the slot 709 , through the hole 213 with which the plate 13 is provided, in such a way as to move the pawl hook 114 away from the toothing of the head 112 of the pin 12 . In this way, the pin 12 is able to rotate freely in both directions indicated by the arrows 5 and B , and the panels 8 and 10 can be inter spaced by eventually withdrawing the peg 7 from the hole 109 . According to another form of embodiment illustrated in Pigs.5 and 6, the pawl is formed by a cylinder 16 movable inside the section 509 , of a suitable shape and provided with circumferential teeth for it to mesh with the head 112 of the pin 12 . Under normal working conditions, the cylinder 16 is kept wedged in between the wall 509a of the section 509 and the head 112 of the pin 12 under the thrust of a spring 25 whose function is identical to that of the spring 15 . Xlthen the above condition prevails, likewise to what was seen above, the pin 12 can only rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow 3, that is to say, in the same direct ion as that in which the peg 7 is inserted into the hole 109 . Rotation in the opposite direction would be prevented b the cylinder 16 being forcibly wedged in between the wall 509a and the head 112 of the pin 12 .Again in this case by using a punch inserted in the hole 13a provided in a covering plate 13a for the section 509 , the cylinder ,6 can be m.ede to move away from the head 112 and the pin 12 be allowed to rotate freely in both directions, the pin 12 with the axis around which tile said awl 14 is able to rotate.The effect of tnis is that when the pin 12 is rotating anticlockwise, the pawl 14 , as it gradually climbs over the toothing with which the said head 112 is provided, does not oppose the said rotation. J, f, instead, the pin 12 should tend to rotate clock.rise, the pawl 14 engages fixedly with the said tocthing and halts the pin 12 .With the covering plate mounted, the semi circular slot 7C9 is coaxial with a circular hole 213 that runs through the said plate 13 .Now with reference to wigs. 3 and 4, the operation of the device forming the subject of the invention will be described, and it is pointed out thst under normal conditions the spring is keeps the pawl 14 pushed towards that side of the section 509 where there is the semi circular slot 7C9 , whilst the hook 114 of the pawl 14 engages with the toothing of the head 112 of the pin 12 . hen the panels 8 and 10 are coupled manually, placed orthogonally one at the side of the other, the peg 7 , as it moves forward in the hole 109 in the direction shown with the arrow C in Fig. 3, at the time the rack 2C7 there of engages with the sprocket 212 , causes the pin 12 to rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow B. Because of the arrangement of the pawl 14 with respect to the head 112 of the pin 12 and cf the thrust exerted by the spring 15 on the said pawl, the pin 12 is no longer able to rotate in the reverse direction.Thus the panels 8 and 10 are connected one to the other right from the time they are placed side by side, in a way that is already quite tight. With the panels 8 and 10 side by side, the pin 12 can, if necessary, be made to head 112 xits into the receding part 2C9 . hen the peg 7 penetrates into the hole 109 , the rack 207 meshes with the sprocket 212 and thus the pin 12 rotates in one direction or the other, depending upon the movement of the peg 7 with respect to the hole 109 .On account of assembly reasons for certain of the parts, the accepting element 9 has on the front face thereof a small rectangular housing 809 to allow a covering plate 13 to be mounted in a removable fashion. The said housing communicates with the receding part 209 and thus when the pin 12 is mounted, the plate 13 is placed partially over, through the edge 313 thereof, a section of the head 112 of the pin, thereby preventing the latter from coming out of the seating in which it is housed.Comprised in the receding part 209 there is a roughly trapezoidal section 509 which is linked to the former at the same level of depth and extends at a lower level with respect to the housing 809 , in the region thereof. On the wall of the said section 509 of the receding part 209 , which when the accepting element is mounted on the panel 10 is positioned towards the edge 110 , there is a cylindrical slot 709 of a semi circular section, that runs vertically.Provision is made on the opposite wall for a notch 609 , approximately orthogonal thereto, inside which a spring 15 is housed. Housed freely in the trapezoidal section 509 of the receding part 209 there is a pawl 14 of an analogous profile, though narrower in width, which on the side that is turned towards the head 112 of the pin 12 , is in the form of a small hook 114 .The length of the pav i is such that once it is in the position of engagement with the toothing of the head 112 , it stays displaced annularly ith respect to the imaginary line that theoretically connects the axis of rotation of an accepting element 9 , flush mounted on the other panel 10 , inside which the pe 7 can be inserted.The said peg 7 preferably made of metal is cylindrical and has on the opposite extremity to that used to secure it to the panel 8 , a succession of grooves 107 , the central one of which protrudes from the panel for a distance theoretical A. The grooves 107 form a sort of rack 207 , more about which will be said in due course.The body 9 preferably made of metal is a low cylinder stably flush mounted in the panel 10 , with care being taken to ensure that the axis thereof parallel to the edge 110 of the panel is at the same distance A theoretical , stated previously, away from the said edge.The accepting element 9 is provided with a hole 109 inside which the peg 7 can pass.On a plane parallel to the axis of the said hole there is, in the front face of the body of the accepting element 9 , a receding part 209 which, at a certain level, decreases in diameter and provides a cylindrical groove 309 . The base of this has in it a hole 409 of a lesser diameter.The said cylindrical groove 309 communicates tangentially with the hole 109 . At 12 there is a special pin, the head 112 of which is cylindrical, and the perimeter of this is provided with small, close set, teeth, whilst the shank has toothing that forns a sprocket 212 with few teeth see for their profile the front view with a dotted line inside the groove 309 in Fig. 1 , shaped to suit the grooves 107 of the pee 7 . nle said pin 12 is dimensioned in a way w ereby the shank is housed in the cylindrical groove 309 and in the hole rut ef the body of the accepting element 9 , whilst the
