# CARTRIDGE FIRING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A propellant cartridge 12 mounted in a body 10, 14, 16 has two percussion caps 34 at one end which can be struck, to fire the cartridge, by respective firing pins 24, 24a, slidable mounted in the body for movement from retracted positions, spaced from the percussion caps, to their firing positions. The firing pins, normally held in their retracted positions by shear pins 38, can be urged towards their firing positions, to fire the cartridge, after shearing of the shear pins, by a common firing member 40 in the form of a piston slidable in a bore 42 in the body and to which bore gas under pressure may be supplied to fire the cartridge. The arrangement described affords increased reliability of cartridge firing.
