# Engine combustion control system.

## Abstract
The system comprises a zirconium sensor 12 inter posed in the exhaust conduit 14 of a gas fueled engine 16 for sensing both oxygen content and temperature of the exhaust gases, and for emitting electrical analog signals thereof to a comparator controller 22 . In turn, the latter transmits a complementary, derivative electrical signal to a current to pressure transducer 26 . The transducer is sup plied with gas under pressure, from the engine fuel gas supply line, 28 and the pressure of this transducer supplied gas is modulated by the aforesaid derivative signal. The modulated gas pressure is communicated with a gas cylin der 34 having a translattng piston rod 96 which is opera tively engaged with an otherwise standard gas engine reg ulator 36 for trimming control of the flow of fuel gas through the regulator 36 .
