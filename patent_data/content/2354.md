## Description
It has been surprisingly found that the sulfomat ing agents can be used to sulonate eiastoveric polymers hav ing more than 0.2 wt. water to conversion levels, based on the conversion of sultonating agent to incorporated sulfur in the sulfonated elastomeric polymer, of more than 70 percent more preferably more than 80 percent and most preferably more than about 85 percent. The present invention describes an improved process for the sulfonation of elastomeric polymers having mor than 0.2 wt. 7. water to a conversion level, based on the conversion of sulfonating agent to incorporated sulfur in the sulfonated elastomeric polymer, of at least 7QZ more preferably at least 80t and most preferably at least 85 , wherein the conver sion is based upon the sulfonating agent being present in the stoichiometric amounts to the amount of available unsaturation in the elastomeric polymer that is, the molar ratio of sul o nating agent to available unsaturation sites in the elastomeric polymer is 1.0 or below. The improved sulfonation agents for the improved sulfonation process are a mixture of a sulfur trioxide donor complexed with a Lewis base containing oxygen, phosphorus sulfur with an acid anhydrideEMI2.1 or an acid halideEMI2.2 wherein R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon or an aronatic hydrocarbon radical and X is F, Cl, Bro or I. The improved sulfonating agents can also be formed from mixtures of acyl sulfateEMI2.3 with carboxylic acid anhydridesEMI2.4 with carboxylic acid halidesEMI2.5 or with both, wherein R is selected from the group consisting ofCH3 , C2R5 , C37 , C4H9 , C5H11, , C6H13 or C6H5 and mixtures thereof. The molar ratio ofEMI2.6 and or EMI2.7 withEMI2.8 is at least one.

Sulfuric Acid, Carboxylic Acid Anhydride, And Acyl HalideEMI4.3 Another especially desirable alternative aulfonation agent to be used with elastomeric polymers having more than 0.2 wt. Z water is a mixture or acid anhydride and halo sulfonic acid. VII. Halosulfonic Acid and Carboxylic Acid AnhydrideEMI5.1 When the reagent acyl sulfate is generated from halosulfonic acid and carboxylic acid anhydride, a by product acyl halide is formed. When water impurity reacts with the acyl sulfate to form sulfuric acid and carboxylic acid, the acyl halide co reacts with the sulfuric acid tokregenerate acyl sulfate as described under Method V. It is possible in the generation of reagents according to Methods, V and VI to form the reagents and effect the process in the following different ways A. Preform reagent from sulfuric acid and desired excess of acid anhydride or acyl halide. B. Preform reagent from sulfuric acid and sufficient acid anhydride or acyl halide. Add excess acid anhydride or acyl halide to the polymer cement prior to reagent addition. C. Prepare reagent in situ by addition of excess acid anhydride or acyl halide to the polymer cement followed by slow addition of sulfuric acid. Reagent from Method VII cannot be generated in situ in the case of unsaturated polymers since the reaction of halosulfonic acid with polymer unsaturation is extremely rapid so that reaction with acid anhydride hardly occurs and a gelled polymer mass results. However, reagent from MethodVII can be pre generated and used according to Methods A and B. The carboxylic acid anhydride or the acyl halide or both can be added to the wet polymer cement followed by the addition of a solution of the complex of the S03 donor.Lewis or H2SO. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid anhydride or the ac l halide can be mixed with the solution of the S03 complex of the S03 donoroLewis base or H2S04 prior to the addition to the polymer cement. The carboxylic acid anhydrides and acyl halides are derived from carboxylic acids having a solubility of at least about 0.2 graPs 100 ml. of water at 250C. Typical carboxylic acid anhydrides and acyl halides are acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, or benzoic acid and mixtures thereof.The preferred carboxylic acid anhydride is acetic anhydride because of its low molecular weight, availability and effectiveness. The acyl halides may be acyl fluoride, acyl chloride, or acyl bronide, preferably the acyl chloride. Just as with the carboxylic acid anhydride, the preferred acyl chloride is acetyl chloride because of its low molecular weight, its availability and its effectiveness. Therefore, the sulfonating agent of the present in Invention can be generally defined as a mixture of a carboxylic acid anhydride or an acyl halide or both with a complex of a sulfur trioxide donor and a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus wherein the molar ratio of acid anhydride or acyl halide or both to complex is at least 1 and at least 707. of the amount of sulphonating agent present in the .reaction zone that does not exceed the stoichiometric amount of sulfonating agent required to react with all the available sites of unsaturation in the elastomeric polymer is converted to sulfonate groups on said elastomeric polymer more preferably the conversion is at least 80 , and most preferably the conversion is at least 857., wherein the molar ratio of sulfonating agent to available unsaturation sites in the elastomeric polymer is 1.0 or less. The X oooversion, or conversion level, is based on the conversion of the reagent to sulfur containing groups incorporated within the sulfonated polymers. Sulfonate groups are those groups containing the S03 moiety connected through sulfur atom to a carbon atomEMI7.1 The sulfonate group introduced via sulfonation is typically a sulfonic acidEMI7.2 or other sulfonate precursor group depending upon the olefinic structure to be sulfonated.These compounds are generally easily reacted with metallic bases to the corresponding metal sulfonatesEMI7.3 During titration of s ilfonated polymers with sodium hydroxide, or other metallic bases, the sulfonate compounds consume 1 equivalent of sodium hydroxideEMI8.1 Sulfate groups are those groups containing the S04 moiety connected to a carbon aton within the polymer through one of the oxygen atomsEMI8.2 During titration of sulfonated polymers with bases such as sodium hydroxide sulfates consume two equivalents of base per sulfate group or per mole of sulfurEMI8.3 to produce a neutral alcohol and sodium sulfate. Sulfonated polymers can be readily analyzed for their sulfur contents through procedures such as the Dietert method and the Paar method. When the sulfur content determined from sulfur analysis corresponds on a molar basis to the equivalents of base consumed during titration all of the combined sulfur is in sulfonate form. However, if the equivalents of base consumed during titration exceeds that of the molar sulfur content, then at least some of the combined sul fur is in sulfate form. When all of the sulfur is in sulfate form, then the equivalents of base is exactly twice that of the molar sulfur content. When sulfation occurs in the absence OL sulfation, the sulfation reaction is a very low yield reaction based on the conversion of the original sulfonating agent to sulfur containing groups within the polymer . Consequently, highyield sulfonation reactions can be considered to result in little, if any, sulfation. The sulfonating agent reacts with the elastomeric polymers of this invention through unsaturation sites of the elastomeric polymer and not through the saturated backbone.Thus, the achievable sulfonate content is limited by the amount of available unsaturation in the elastomeric polymer.For example, if the polymer contains 20 mmoles of unsaturation per 100 grams of polymer, then it will be possible to introduce only 20 mmoles of sulfonate groups per 100 grams of polymer. If higher sulfonate contents are desired, then the starting polymer must contain at least as much unsaturation. It should be obvious to those skilled in the art that when an excess sulfonating agent is added own a molar basis to an unsaturated polymer, the conversion of sulfonating agent to sulfur containing groups can never be 1007.. For example, when two moles of sulfonating agent are added per mole of available unsaturation, a maximum conversion of only 507. is possible. It is certainly within the scope of this invention to use excesses of reagent and obtain reduced conversions of sulfonating agent. However, this is both un necessary and undesirable. Di course, reagent cost increases, and in some instances some undesirable side reactions can occur with excess reagent present. In addition, the subsequent neutralization of the sulfonation mixture becomes more complicated and costly due to the larger quantities of base required for full neutralization of the sulfonation mixture. For the invention described herein, conversion of the reagent has been determined under conditions where the molar ratio of sulfonating agent to available unsaturation is 1.0 or below. If, for example, the polymer contains 50 mmoles of unsaturat on per 100 grams of polymer, no more than 50 moles of reagent can be used to determine reagent conversion.Generally it is desirable to use less than one mole of reagent per mole of available unsaturation to achieve the sulfonate levels which produce desirable changes in polymer properties.Although higher levels or sulfonating agent can be used for the process of introducing sulfonate groups, the efficiency of the sulfonation reaction cannot be determined under these conditions. The amount of desirable sulfonation depends on the particular application. Preferably, .he elastomeric polymer is sulfonated at 10 to 100 meq. sulfonate groups 100 g or polymer, more preferably at 10 to 50 meq. sulfonate groups 100 g of polymer, and most preferably at 20 to 40 meq. sulfo nate groups lOOg of polymer. The sulfonate content of the polymer is determined by both titration of the sulfonate groups and Dietert sulfur analysis. In the titratfon of the sulfate groups, the polymer ws dissolved in solvent consisting of 95 parts of toluene and 5 parts ot methanol at a con central on level of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The poly of combined isoolefin and 0.2 to 15 of combined multiolefin.Butyl rubber generally has a Staudinger molecular eight of 20,000 to 500,000, preferably about 25,000 to 400,000, especially 100,000 to 400,000 and a Wijs Iodine No. of 0.5 to 50, preferably 1 to 15. The preparation of Butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent 2,356,128. For the purposes of this invention, the autyl rubber may have incorporated therein from 1 0.2 to 10 of combined multiolefin, preferably 0.5 to 67., nore preferably L to 4 , e.g. 27.. Illustrative of such a Butyl rubber is Exxon Butyl 268 Exxon Chemical Co. , having a mole percent unsaturation of 2.0 and a Mooney viscosity ML 1 3, 260 F. of 50 60. Low molecular weight Butyl rubbers, i.e., Butyl rubbers having a viscosity average molecular weight as measured by GPC of 5,000 to 85,000 and a mole percent unsaturation of 3 to 4 3ay be sulfonated by the process or this invention.Preferably, these polymers have 2 viscosity average molecular weight as measured by GPC of 25,000 to 60,000. The term EPDt4 is used in the sense of its definition as found in ASTM D 1418 64 and is intended to mean a ter polymer containing ethylene and propylene in the backbone and a diene in a side chain. Illustrative methods for producing these terpolymers are found in U.S. Patent 3,280,082, BritishPatent 1,030,289 and French Patent 1,386,600. The preferred terpolymers contain 40 to 75 wt.

The meric sulfonate is titrated with ethanolic sodium hydroxide to an Alizarin Thymolphthalein end point. The elastomeric polymers of the present invention which are sulfonated by the aforementioned sulfonating agents are derived from synthetic and natural polymers having olefinic unsaturation sites through which sulfonation occurs, wherein the polymer has from 0.1 to 5.0 mole olefinic unsaturation. The unsaturation sites can be in the polymer backbone, pendant therefrom or cyclic, except that aromatic containing polymers are excluded from this description. In particular, the unsaturated polymers of this present invention include low unsaturated elastomeric polymers such asButyl rubber, or EPDM terpolymers. Alternative unsaturated polymers are partially hydrogenated polyisoprene.partially hydrogenated polybutadienes, Neoprene styrene butadiene copolymers and isoprene styrene random copolymers. Highly unsaturated elastomers other than Neoprene, such as polybutadiene would be contemplated in this invention in terms of pacifying the water contained in the sulfonat.on cement. However, such high unsaturation polymers gel with the reagents of this invention and useless products result. The expression Butyl rubber as employed in the specification and claims is intended to include copolymers made from polymerization reaction mixture having therein from 70 to 99.5 7. by weight of an isoolefin which has 4 to 7 carbon atoms, e.g. isobutylene and 0.5 to 30 by wt. of a conjugated multiolefin having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g. isoprene. The resulting copolymer contains 85 to 99.8Z by wt. as as measured by GPC of the terpolymer is preferably 10,000 to 200,000, more preferably 15,000 to 100,000, and most preferably 20,000 to 60,000. The Mooney viscosity NL 1 8 of the terpolymer at 212 F. is preferably 5 to 60, more preferably 10 to 50 and most preferably 15 to Lo, e.g. 20.

The aforementioned elastomeric polymers can be broken down through a combination of shear and heat such as in an extruder to form lower molecular species having lower Mooney vis cosities. For example, Vistalon 2504 can be reprocessed through an extruder to a blooney viscosity at 2120 F. of 20 with an Mn of 26,000 and an RW of 125,000 wherein the reprocessed V 2504 is designated as Vistalon 2504 20. In carrying out the sulfonation process of the present invention, a cement which contains an olefinically unsaturated elastomeric polymer dissolved in a solvent is contacted with a sulfonating agent, wherein the solvent is non reactive to the sulfonating agent and to the unsaturated elastomeric polymer. The solvent is preferably a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon.Illustrations of these solvents are isopentane, cyclopentane, n pentane, cyclohexane, isohexane, n hexane, heptane, 1,2 dichloroethane, methylene chloride or chlorobenzene, and mixtures thereof. The concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the neutral solvent is usually 2 to 25 wt..t, preferably 5 to 20, and more preferably 10 to 15. The sulfonating agent is formed from a mixture o a carboxylic acid anhydride or acyl halide with H2S04 or a sulfur trioxide donor complexed with a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus Alternatively, the carboxylic acid anhydride or acyl halide is added to the sulfonation cement followed by the S03 donor.Lewis base complex. The term sulfur trioxide donor as used in the specification means a compound containing available sulfur trioxide. Illustrative of such sulfur trioxide donors are SO3, chlorosultonic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid. The term complexing agent as used in the specification means a Lewis base suit able for use in the practice of this invention, wherein Lewis base is an electron pair donor.Illustrative of Lewis bases suitable for use as complexing agents are certain phosphorus compounds. While the phosphorus compound may be either inorganic or organic, it is preferred that the phosphorus compound be an organic compound. Various organic phosphites, phosphinites, phosphinates, phosphonates, phosphates, phosphonites, and phosphines may be used as the complexing agent.The organic substituents consist of C1 to C10 alkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl groups. Ethers and thioethers have been found useful for complexing sulfur trioxide donor to facilitate reaction with the unsaturation of polymer molecules.The ethers and thioethers may contain one, two or more ether oxygens or sulfurs and may be linear or cyclic. Illustrative of the ether Lewis bases suitable for use in the practice of this invention are paradioxane, 2,3 dichloro 1,4 dioxane, metadioxane, 2,4 dimethyL 1,3 dioxane, 2 phenyl 1,3 dioxane, diethyl ether, trioxane and bis 2 dichloroethyl ether. The preferred oxygen containing bases are p dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and bis 2 dichloroethyl ether.Illustrative of the thioethers are diethyl sulfide, dibutyl sulfide, and tetra hydrothiophene. Other oxygen containing Lewis bases suitable as complexing agents are carboxylic acid esters, wherein the car boxylic acid is a Cl to CL0 aliphatic acid, benzoic acid or phenyl acetic acid. Illustrative of such esters are benzyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, methyl benzoate, hexyl ace tate, isobutyl benzoate, ethyl o brotnobenzoate, p nitrophenyl acetate, ethyl n butyrate, ethyl stearate and ethyl phenyl acetate. The preferred solvents for preparation of the complexes of sulfur triox,de donor with completing agents containing oxygen are chlorinated hydrocarbons.Illustrative of such chlorinated solvents are carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chioroethane, chloroform, and methylene chloride.The complexes may also be prepared by direct addition of reagents, if precautions are taken to dissipate evolved heat.The acid anhydrideEMI16.1 or acyl halideEMI16.2 wherein R is an aliphat c or aromatic hydrocarbon radical such as CH3, C2Hs, C3H7, C4H9, CsHll, C6H13 or C6H5 are added to a cement of the elastomeric polymer prior to the addition of the solution of the complex of the sulfur trioxide donor with the Lewis base or alternatively can be added to the complex prior to addition to the cement. The carboxylic acid anhydrides and acyl halides are derived from carboxylic acids having a solubility of at least aDout 0.2 grams 100 ml. of water at 25 C. Typical carboxylic acid anhydrides and acyl hades are acetic acid,propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, or benzoic acid and mixtures thereof.The preferred carboxylic acid anhydride is acetic anhydride because of its low molecular weight, availability and effec tveness. The acyl halides are selected frcrr the group acyl fluoride, acyl chloride, and acyl bromide, preferably the acyl chloride. Just as with the carboxylic acid anhydride, the preferred acyl chloride is acetyl chloride because of its low molecular weight, its availability and its effectiveness. In the generation of acetyl sulfate from H2SO4 and these reagents, the molar ratio of the acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride to the concentrated sulfur acid is at least 2. When a mixture of RCOX or RCO 2 and H2S04 is used the sulfonating species of the present invention is RCOO S03H, wherein R can be CH3, C2Hs, C3H7, C4Hg, C5Hll, C6HL3, or C6H5 CH2. The sulfonating species can be formed from a plurality of various chemical redactions as illustrated in the following equations EMI17.1 wherein M is sodium, potassium, lithium or cesium and X is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The more preferred acyl sulfates are those prepared according to equations 2, 3, 4, and 6, since acyl sulfates generated according to equations 1 and 5 generally require solvents for their preparation and require separate addition of acid anhydride or acid halide to the cement. Obviously, these reagents which can be prepared and used neat are more preferred. The most preferred acyl sulfate sulfonation agents are those which can be generated from H2S04 or XS03H in the absence of solvents 2, 3 and 6 . Although the preferred sulfonation agents can be prepared in solution with such solvents as chlorinated aliphatics, such as 1,2 chloroethane or chloroform, and aromatics, such as chlorobenzene, it is more desirable to prepare them neat. The most preferred process is the generation of the sulfonation agent in situ, i.e., by adding the acid anhydride or acid halide to the polymer cement followed by addition of sulfuric acid 2,3 . The acyl sulfate is highly reactive to water according to the following equation.EMI18.1 The complex is highly reactive to water as illustrated by the following equation SO3. Lewis Base H2O H2SO4 Lewis Base If the elastomeric polymer has only 0.5 wt. 7. of water 27.8 mmoles per 100 grams of polymer , the water can almost completely consume the complex, when the elastomeric polymer is to be sulfonated to a level of 25 to 35 mmoles of sulfonate groups. In the sulfonation of unsaturated elastomers, the H2S04 generated from the decomposition of the complex by reaction with water is incapable of forming sulfonate groups e.g. EMI18.2 but rather forms sulfatesEMI19.1 The formation of the sulfate groups is highly undesirable. Thermally these neutralized sulfate groups are less stable than those of the sulfonate groups. Furthermore, the sulfate groups are readily hydrolyzed whereas the desired sulfonate form of the elastomeric polymers are gel free and hydrolytically stable. Gel free means that the sulfonated polymer contains less than 5 wt. 7. gel, more preferably less than 3, and most preferably less than I as measured by stirring a given weight of polymer in a solvent comprised oz 95 toluene 5 methanol at a concentration of 50g liter for 24 hours, allowing the mixture to settle, withdrawing a weighed sample of the supernatant solution and evaporating to dryness. Hydrolytically stable means that the acid function, in this case the sulfonic acid, will not be eliminated under neutral or slightly basic conditions to a neutral moiety which is incapable of being converted to a highly ionic functionality. When the sulfate hydrolyzes, the polymer functionality is reduced to an alcohol which has no ionic properties and all coulombic attractions are lost. Therefore, during the sulfonation reaction of unsaturated elastomers containing highly substituted unsaturation, it is necessary to minimize the adverse effect of water. Most often, the water is present in the elastomeric polymer to be sulfonated, wherein the elastomeric polymer has not been thoroughly dried, i.e. the elas tomeric polymer contains more thari 0.1 wt. Z water. U. S.patent 3,642,728 teaches rhat the reactions of complexes ofSO3 with the snsâturation sites of polymer chains is nonquantitative and that it is desirable to use excess complex to give the required amount of sulfonation. However, although by using excess reagent, higher sulfur contents are obtained complexities arise in unavoidable side reactions occurring such as with sulfuric acid and the economics of manufacture are effected. In addition, the neutralization chemistry of such a sulfonated system is complex and also expensive and results in the incorporation of undesirable inorganic salts in the isolated neutralized sulfonated elastomer. For these reasons, it is undesirable to use excesses of S03 complexes.In fact, it is most desirable to obtain conversions and thereby use little or no excess. High conversions of SO3 donorLewis base complexes to the sulfonated elastomeric polymer can be readily achieved through the use of carboxylic acid anhydr d and acyl halides. Most all commercial elastomers are isolated through steam stripping , a process where the polymer cement is added to hot water and the hydrocarbon solvent is flashed off leaving a water wet polymer crumb.The crumb is generally dewatered and dried in suitably designed extruders. Extremely low molecular weight polymers, which are especially desirable for the preparation of thermoelastic materials through sulwonaticn, are very difficult to dry and frequently contain more water than their higher moiecular weight counterparts. And so it is difficult to rproducibly sulfonate such wet polymers unless accurate water analyses are available for each batch of polymer to be sul fonated. Since water levels. are frequently quite variable, it becomes impractical to analyze or even rely on what analyses are obtained. According to this invention, even wet polymer cements can easily be sulfonated to quality products containing the precise number of sulfonate groups desired. The hydrocarbon cement of elastomeric polymers of.the present invention may have 0.1 to 5 wt. of wate preferably 0.2 to 4.0 and more preferably 0.2 to 3 based on the elastomeric polymer. While frequently the source of water in polymer cements is the undried base polymer itself, it is possible that water can find its way to the polymer cement in other ways.For example, the solvent for preparing the polymer cement may contain water, the sulfonation kettle may not have been dried after cleaning, and leaking water or steam lines may result in a wet sulfonation cement. Sulfonation of the elastomeric polymer is conducted at a temperature between 100 C. to lOOeC., wherein the reaction time is preferably I to 60 minutes, mon preferably 5 te 45 minutes and most preferably 15 to 30 minutes. The sulfonation of less substituted olefinic structures such as derived from 1,4hexadiene terpolymers requires somewhat higher temperatures, e.g. 50 C., when unsaturation levels are low, e.g. less than 2 mole Z. More highly substituted olefinic structures, such as derived from 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene are rapidly sulfonated at room temperature and below even at low levels of unsaturation. The generated sulfonated elastomeric polymer is soluble in the solvent of the cement.The sulfonation reaction is quenched with an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, a cycloaliphatic alco hol, such as cyclohexanol, or an.aromatic. hydroxyl compound such as phenol. The amount of desirable sulfonation depends on the particular application. Preferably, the elastomeric polymer is sulfonated at 10 to 100 meq. sulfonate groups lOOg of sul fonated polymer, more preferably at 10 to 50 meq. sulfonate groups lOOg of sulfonated polymer, and most preferably at 20 to 40 meq. sul onate grwps lOOg of sulfonated polymer. The meq. of sulfonate 100 g of polymer is determined by both titration of the polymeric sulfonate and Dietert sulfur analysis. In the titration of the sulfonated polymer, the polymer is dissolved in solvent consisting of 95 parts of toluene and 5 parts of methanol at a concentration level of 50 grams per liter of solvent.The sulfonate is titrated withethanolic a sodium hydroxide to an Alizarin Thymolphthalein end point. In carrying out the present invention, an olefin icily unsaturated elastomeric polymer is dissolved in a solvent to form a cement, wherein the solvent is non reactive to the sulfonating aent and to the unsaturated elastomeric polymer. The solvent is preferably a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an alicyclic hydrocarbon or a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon. Illustrations of these solvents are isopentane, n pentane, cyclohexane, isohexane, n hexane, heptane, 1,2 dichloroethane, methylene chloride, or chlorobenzene and mixtures thereof. The concen tration of the elastomeric polymer in the neutral solvent is 2 to about 25 wt. , preferably 5 to 20 and more preferably 10 to 15 wt. Z. The most preferred solvents of this present invention for the mixture of RC02S03H and RCO oO or RCOX are the lower molecular weight aliphatic and cycloaliphatic saturated carbon hydrogen compounds comprising from 4 to 7 carbon atoms per molecule, preferably 5 to 7 carbon atoms per molecule, and mixtures the of. Examples of such solvents are n butane, isopentane, neopentane, n pentane, cyclopentane, n hexane, isohexane, cycle. hexane, commercial Exxon hexane, n heptane, commercial Exxon heptane, etc. The sulfonation reagents of this invention must contain a carboyxlic acid anhydride or acyl halide in order that high reagent conversions may be achieved. Polymers containing unsaturation and sulfonate groups have been found to be somewhat deficient in thermostability. Therefore, it is desirable to neutralize a substantial portion of the sulfonate groups as part of the manu fracturing of sulfonated elastomeric polymer. In addition, neutralization is required to fully develop the physical properties of the sulfonated polymer. In preparing the ionomer, it is desirable to neutralize essentially every sulfonate group. However, lower degrees of neutralization, e.g.95 are useful in the practice of this invention. The neutralizing agents which msy Se used are the metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, alkoxides or metallic salts having 1 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule or metallic salt of carboxylic acids, wherein the metal ion of the metallic salt of the carboxylic acid is iron, aluminum, antimony, lead or a metal of groups T A, II A, I B or Il B of the Periodic Table of Elements or a mixture thereof. The neutralization agents which are dissolved in ater or alcohols or mixtures thereof are added to the cement of the sulfonated alastomeric polymer thereby neutralizing the unneutralized sulfonate groups. The carboxylate ion of te metallic salt of the carboxylic acid is derived from the following carboxylic acids as illustrated in the present . .vention acetic, ben cic, lauric, palitic, myristic, decanoic, octanoic, and stearic. However, other carboxylic acids of the same generic class can je readily employed and are considered within the cope of the invention. Useful examples of metal hydroxides are NaOH, KOH, LiOH, Mg OH 2 and Ba OH 2. Useful carbonates are the alkali metal carbonates. The metal sulfonate containing polymers at the higher sulfonata levels possess extremely high melt viscosities and are thereby difficult to process. The addition of ionic group plasticiezers markedly reduces melt viscosity and frequently enhances physical properties. The preferential plasticizer is a carboxylic acid or a metal salt of a carboxylic acid , wherein the metal ion of the metal salt of the carboxylic acid isEMI24.1 iron, aluminum, antimony, lead on a inetal of Groups I A,II A, I B or II B of the Periodic Table of Elements or a mixture thereof. The preferential plasticizer is incorporated inFo the neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer at 3 to 60 parts per hundred by weight of neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably at 5 to 40, and most preferably at 7 to 25.The neutralizing agent and plasticizer can be the same chemical species such as a metallic salt of fatty acid in which case additional metallic salt of the fatty acid is added over what is needed for neutralization. Alterna tive preferential plasticizers are carboxylic acid esters, trialkyl phosphates, amines, or amides and mixtures thereof. The preferred plasticizers are stearic acid or metallic salts of stearic acid or a mixture thereof. The resultant neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer with preferential plasticizer is isolated as a crumb from the solution by conventional steam stripping and filtration. The wet crumb can be dried in a dewatering extruder, in a fluid bed dryer, or on a hot two roll mill. The dried neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer can be compounded with various additives in order to modify its physical and rheological properties. These additives are waxes, extender oils, fillers, pigments, ionic group plasticizers, antiosidants, stabilizers, or a mixture thereof. The additive or mixture of additives is incorporated into the neutralized sulfonated elastomer at a concentration level of 1 to 300 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of neutralised sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably 5 to 275 most preferably 10 to 250. Alternatively, the unneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer can be isolated as a crumb by steam stripping.The additives are compounded into the fluxed unneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, the neutralizing agent and plasticizer are then added, and fluxing is continued until the sulfonate groups have been neutralized to at least 95 . The advantage of this alternative method is that the viscosity oE the unneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer is sub stan tially lower than the viscosity of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer thereby facilitating better compounding with the additives to be incorporated. The fillers employed in the present invention may be carbon blacks, talcs, ground calcium carbonate, water precipitated calcium carbonate, and delaminated, calcined and hydrated clays or a mixture. thereof. Examples of carbon black are the furnace, channel or thermal blacks.These fillers may be incorporated into the blend composition at 10 to 200 parts per hundred by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably at 10 to 150 parts per hundred parts bp weight and most preferably at 10 to 150 parts per hundred by weight. The waxes employed in the present invention may be polyolefinics, paraffinic. aromatic. or naphthenic . In particular, the waxes employed in this present invention have a softening point of 135 F. to 220 F., more preferably 135eF. to 200 F. and most preferably about 1500F. to 200 F. Tke preferred waxes have less than 2 wt. 7. of polar type compounds and an Mn of 1000 to 5000, more preferably 1500 to 3000. The waxes contemplated for use in this present invention can beEMI26.1 synthetic, petroleum natural waxes. The waxes may be incorporated into the blend composi tion at a concentration level of 1 to 50 parts by weight per hundred, 100 parts of the neutralized sulfonated polymers, more preferably 1 to 40, and most preferably 1 to 30. The oils employed in the present invention are non . polar process oils having less than 2 wt. 7. polar type compounds as measured by molecular type clay gel analyses.These oils are s.elected from paraffinics ASTM Type 10B as defined in ASTM D 2226 70, Aromatics ASTM Type 102 or Naphthenics ASTM Type 104A, wherein the oil has a flash point by the open cup of at least 350 F., a pour point of less than 400F., a viscosity of 70 to 3000 ssu s and a number average molecular weight of 400 to 1000, and more prefetably 300 to 750. The preferred process oils are paraffinics. The oils may be incorporated into the blend compositions at 10 to 250 parts hy weight per hundred parts by weight oftheneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably at 25 to 150 and most preferably at 50 to 150 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight. A metallic hydroxide can be incorporated into the blend composition as a means of neutralizing any residual free carboxylic acid ionic plasticizer in the neutralized sulfonated terpolymer. The metallic hydroxide may be incorporated at a concentration level of about less than 2.0 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralised sulfonated elastomeric polymer, wherein the metal ion of the metallic hydroxide may be a metal of Group II A of the Periodic Table of Ele melts, e.g., barium, calcium, and magnesium. The advantages of both the reagents and processes fo the sulfonation of wet polymer cements can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples and tailes. EXAMPLE I Into 1250 ml. of heptane was dissolved 100g of an ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene copolymer, Vistalon 2504 20. The copolymer contained about 50 wt. 7.ethylene ad about 5 wt. EN3. It possessed a Mooney vis cosity ML, 1 3, 212 F. of about 20. This polymer was produced through the hot extrusion breakdown of commercial 40 Mooney Vistalon 2504 and additionally had been dried on a hot rubber mill so that little water was contained in the polymer. Acetyl sulfate was prepared as follows in the following proportions Acetic anhydride 152.6 ml. s 164.8g 1.62 moles was cooled to 30 C. Concentrated sulfuric acid 103.0g w 0.998 mole was added slowly so that temperature would not exceed 0 C. The neat reagent was about 4.84 molar.The viscous reagent was allowed to warm to 10 C., and an aliquot was taken for sulfonation. To the polymeric cement at room temperature was added 10.3 ml. cf the neat acetyl sulfate 50 mmoles . The cement developed a deep purple color, and it was stirred for 60 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 ml. isopropyl alcohol. Then 0.5g ofAntioxidant 2246 was added and dispersed. The acid form of the sulfonated polymer was isolated by steam stripping. The polymer was pulverized and washed in a Waring blender, and the wet crumb was dewatered and dried at about 120 F. on a two roll rubber mill. Five grams of the sulfonated EPDM was dissolved in 100 ml. of 95 toluene S methanol, and the solution was titrated with 0.1 N ethanolic NaOH to an Alizarin thymophthalein end point. nitration showed the polymer to contain 41.6 mil liequivalents meq. of acid per 100 grams of sulfonated poly . mer. This corresponds to a reagent conversion of about 86 ,. Sulfur analysis on the sulfonated polymer showed it to contain 1.27 wt. 7. sulfur which corresponds to 39.7 meq. or sulfonic acid. The correspondence of the titration date and the sulfur data is excellent. The acid form of the sulfonated polymer was mixed according to the following recipe cn a cold rubber mill Polymer 100 Pelletex NS 75 Philblack A 75 Flexon 845 Oil 100 Magnesium Stearate 35The magnesium stearate functions as both a neutralizing agent and plasticizer. Micropads were obtained by molding the oilblack formulation for 10 minutes at 3500F. At room temperature, the oil black formulation had a tensile strength of 1150 psi and zn elongation of 280 . At 100 C. the molded compound possessed a tensile strength of 430 psi and an elongation of 350 . The oil black compound is easily molded, extruded, and injection molded. This example shows that a low unsaturation rbber is easily and efficiently sulfonated with acetyl sulfate sulfonation reagent. After neutralization, the sulfonated products possess good properties, and the products are not their mally unstable.EXAMPLE II The procedures of U S. Patent 3,836,511 were repeated for the sulfonation of a commercial Vistalon 2504.Some of the Vistalon 2504 was dried on a hot 300 F rubber mill and some was used as received. Two next acetyl sulfate reagents were prepared as described in Example I at acetic anhydrid H2SO4 ratios of 1.26 Molarity 5.73 and 1.39 Molarity 5.36 as described in U.S. Patent 3.83b,511. Benzene solutions were prepared by dissolving 100g of Vistalon 2304 as received Runs A and C or mill dried Runs B, D, E, F, G in 1300 ml. of benzene as described inU.S. Patent 3,836,511. In three runs E, F, G 0.5 ml., 1.0 ml., and 2.0 ml., respectively, was added to the benzene cement. Sulfonations were effected by adding 37,5 mmoles freshly prepared acetyl sulfate reagent to the polymer cement at room temperature or 30 minutes.. Polymer work up and analysis was as described in Example I. The results are detailed in Table I.

Yet these conversions were identical to that obtained in U.S. Patent 3,836,511. The sulfonation o as received Vistalon 2504 gave a 437. reagent conversion while drying of the polymer raised the conversion to 50X. It appears that acetyl sulfate reagent reacts sufficiently with benzene to rule it out as a preferred or choice solvent. When benzene cements containing 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt. water on polymer Runs E, F, G were sulfonated with 5.36 M acetyl sulfate reagent, the incorporation of sulfur dropped to 34, 27 and 24 , respectively. These data show that the reagents described inU.S. Patent 3,836,511 are unable to sulfonate wet benzene cements to high reagent conversion and to quality products.EXAMPLE III The procedure described in Example I was repeated with the exception that sulfonation was carried out in situ i.e., 7.66 ml. 81 mmoles of concentrated 95 sulfuric acid was dripped in. The resultant polymer contained 40.0 meq. and 42.2 meq. sulfonic acid per 100 grams by titration and by sulfur analysis, respectively. Thus the sulfonation results were identical to those in Example I. The oil black formulation according to Example I had a tensile strength of i170 psi and an elongation of 280 2e at room temperature. At 1000 C. it had a tensile strength of .380 psi and an elongation of 3707.. Thus the polymers sulfonated with preformed acetyl sulfate and in situ acetyl sulfate are identical.EXAMPLE IV The hydrolysis product of an acyl sulfate is H2S04 and a carboxylic acid. It is necessary to know whether the carboxylic acid possesses an undesirable effect on the course of sulfonation. To 1000 ml. of hexane was added lOOg of an ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene copolymer, Vistalon 250420 of Example I except that it had been dried more thoroughly on a rubber mill to a water content of less than 0.1 tt. 7..Glacial acetic acid was added at five different levels ofTable I . Then 5.74 ml. 60.75 moles of acetic anhydride was added followed by the dropwise addition of .2.10 ml. 37.5 mmoles H2S04 of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes, the reaction was terminated through the addition of 150 ml. isopropanol. A sample was steam stripped, washed in a Waring blender, and then dried on a rubber mill at about 100 120 F, A sample was titrated as described in Example I.Sulfur analyses were obtained. The data are. s marized inTable II. It is quite clear from the titration values and the sulfur analyses that acetic acid had absolutely no effect on the sulfonation of EPDM.

Eight separate runs were made varying in the amount of water added to the polymer cement prior to sulfonation. Sulfonation termlnation and polymer work up were as described in earlier examples. Samples were titrated for acid and analyzed for sulfur. The results are shown inTable III. TABLE III H2O Added Sulfur Analysis Color of SO3H Content By SO3H Content, Ml. Wt. Meq.

In addition, as more water is added, the sulfur that is combining becomes more the sulfate rather than the sulfonate. The sulfur values are lower than the titration values since the sulfate group hydrolyzes off during titration to give a dibasic sulfuric acid rather than a monobasic sulfonic acid.EMI37.1 When about 1Z water and more is present, it appears that all of the combined sulfur is in the sulfate form, i.e., there is very little or no sulfonic acid. These examples clearly show that relatively low levels of water produce off specification products which moderate levels of water produce totally undesirable products, i.e., products which are hardly sulfonated and contain a substantial amount of unstable sulfate groups.Control lOOg of 20 Mooney V 2504 20 of Example I in 1000 ml. hexane sulfonated at 250 C. with 60.75 mmoles of acetic anhydride and 37.5 mmoles H2S04, quenched with 150 ml. isopropanol, and stabilized with 0.5g of Antioxidant 2246.Water Addition The desired amount of water was pipetted in, and the, cement was stirred for one hour. The sulfonation was then effected as described above.Sample Work Up Samples of the cement were steam stripped, washed in a Waring blender with water, and dewatered on a rubbler mill. Samples were titrated for acid, and sulfur contents were determined. EXAMPLE VI In this Example, 21 separate runs were made to determine the effects or water on the sulfonation and the effects c adding excess acetic anhydride on sulfonation. These runs and the results therefrom are detailed in TableIII. In 1000 ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved 100g of Vis talcon 2504 20 polymer of Example I. The desired amount 0 water if any was added and the cement was stirred for about 80 minutes and the desired amount o acetic anhydride listed in Table III was added. Concentrated sulfuric acid 37.5 mmoles H2SO4 was dripped in at room temperature, and the mixture was stirred or 30 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was terminated by the addition o i50 ml. isopropanol, and 0.5g of Antioxidant 2246 was added. The sulfonated polymer was isolated by steam stripping, washing with water In a Waring blender, and dewatering and drying on a warm rubber mill. Samples ere dissolved 5 g 100 ml. in 95 toluene 5 methanol and titrated wit 0.1 N ethanolic NaOH to an Ali zarin thymolphthalein end point. The samples were also analyzed for sulfur. Run 3 in this sample is considered to be the control. It is seen that about an 88 conversion of reagent was obtained. In Run A where the acetic anhydride was reduced somewhat a reduced conversion 80 o reagent to sul fonic acid was obtained. Thid was attributed to still some remaining moisture in the starting polymer. In Runs C, D and E, the acetic anhydride level was innreased that of the control, but the conversion to sulfonic acid basic on sulfonic acid remained substantially unchanged. In Runs F, J, N and R, 0.5, 1.0 2.0 and 3.0 wt. water was added deliberately to the cement prior to sulfona tion with the amount of acetic anhydride used in control run.A dramatic reduction in acid value and sulfur content resulted just as described in Example V. In the remaining runs, acetic anhydride was added to those systems to which had been added water. The amount of acetic anhydride added was equal to and in excess of the amount of water that had been added. The results in Table IV show that the excess acetic anhydride improves sulfonation, and conversion of reagent to sulfonic acid Is again at least as good as that of the control. In Runs G, K, 0 and S, an amount of acetic anhydride equal to the added water was addedConversion of reagent to sulfonic acid were 897., 927., 967. and 91 , respectively. The addition of 25 mmoles and 50 mmoles acetic anhydride in excess of the added water gave essentially identical results. Thus, this example shows that water is effectively compensated for through the addition of at least an equivalent amount of acetic anhydrgde.

These runs and the results therefrom are detailed in Table V. In 1000 ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved lOOg of a 20 Mooney EPDM of the same description as that used in,Example I. The desired amount of water if any was added followed by the desired amount of acetyl chloride listed in Table V . Concentrated sulfuric acid 2.10 ml., 37.5 mmoles was dripped in at room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was terminated with 100 ml. methanol and 0.5g of Antioxidant 2246 was added. The polymers were worked up and analyzed as described in Example IV. Run B is considered to be the control where an 80X conversion of sulfuric acid to sulfonic acid was obtained. In Run A where the acetyl chloride was reduced somewhat a reduced conversion 74 of sulfonic acid was obtained.This again was attributed to some still remaining moisture in the starting polymer. In Runs C, D and E, the acetyl chloride was increased over that of the control. Conversion increased even further in Run C but thereafter remained unchanged with increasing acetyl chloride concentration. The titration values were higher than those obtained by sulfur analysis. This is believed due to the retention of some water insoluble acetyl chloride, but no more than about 5 mmoles. Each mole of acetyl chloride consumes two moles or NaOH during titration. In Runs F, J, N, and R, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 ml.of water was added deliberately to the cement prior to sulfonation with the amount of acetyl chloride used in ControlRun B. A dramatic reduction in acid value and sulfur content resulted just as described in Examples V and VI.

The amount of acetyl chloride added was equal to and in excess of the amount of water that had been added.The results in Table V show that excess acetyl chloride improves sulfonation and conversion of reagent to sulfonic acid is again at least as good as that of the control. In auns G, K, O and S, and amount of acetyl chloride equal to the amount of added water was added. Conversions of sulfuric acid to sulfonic acid were 937., 90, 837. and 84 . The addition of 25 mmoles and 50 moles acetyl chloride in excess or the added water gave identical results.EXAMPLE VIII In 1000 ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved 100g of a 20 Mooney EPDM of the same description as that used inExample I. Two such cements were prepared. Into one cement at room temperature was dripped in 2.48 ml. 37.5 oles of chlorosulfonic acid. Gel formation was immediate, and at the end of the chlorosulfonic addition a gelled mass had wrapped around the stirrer. Into the second cement at room temperature was first charged 3.52 ml. 37.5 mmoles of acetic anhydride.Then 2.48 ml. chlorosulfonic acid was dropped in. The results were identical to that encountered with the first cement in the absence of acetic anhydride. These examples show that chlorosulfonic acid is much too reactive in the sulsonation of unsaturated polymers.In addition, its rate of reaction with acetic anhydride to produce the mild acetyl sulfate sulfonation reagent is slower than its rate of reaction with unsaturated polymer.EXAMPLE IX Acetyl sulfate sulfonation reagent was generated from chlorosulfonic acid as follos 31.0 ml. 0.33 mole of acetic anhydride was cooled to below 0 C. Chlorosulfonic acid 19.9 ml., 0.30 ole was added slowly. After all the chlorosulfonic acid was added, the thick homogeneous reagent was permitted to warm to 100 C. The reagent was 5.90 Molar in acetyl sulfate. A 20 Mooney hexane cement was prepared as described in Example VIII. To the cement was added at room temperature 6.34 ml. of the 5.90 Molar acetyl sulfate 37.5 tmnoles described above. No gel formed and a homogeneous sulfonation cement was obtained. After 30 minutes, the sulfonation cement was inactivated with 150 ml. of isopropanol. The free acid of the polymer was isolated and dried as described inExample VI. Tieration showed the sulfonated polymer to contain 31.2 meq. of free acid. Dietert sulfur analysis showed the polymer to contain 0.84 weight percent sulfur which is equal valent to 26.3 meq. S03H per lOOg of sulfonated polymer.EXAMPLE X Nineteen separate runs were made to determine the effects of water on the sulfonation of EPDM with the preformed acetyl sulfate derived from chlorosulfonic acid and acetic anhydride and the effects of the addition of acetic anhydride and acetyl chloride on the sulfonation of the wet cement.These runs and the results therefrom are detailed in TableVI. 1 ot 2 TABLE VI Run A B C D E F G H I JWater Added, ml. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 1.0 2.0Mmoles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 27.8 55.5 111 CH3C 2O, ml. 1.76 3.52 7.05 OWeight, g 1.91 3.83 7.66 Mmoles 18.75 37.5 75.00 CH3COCl, ml. 1.33 2.66 5.33 Weight, g 1.47 2.94 5.89 Mmoles 18.75 37.5 75.00 SO3 Titration, meq. 100g 43.4 34.0 33.8 39.2 34.4 32.2 33.2 32.0 9.8 8.4Wt. , Sulfur 1.135 0.925 0.915 1.05 0.885 0.905 0.85 0.90 0.24 0.15SO3H, meq 100g 35.5 28.6 28.6 32.8 27.7 28.3 26.6 28.1 7.5 4.7Conversion ofAcetyl Sulfate, 97 79 78 90 76 77 72 77 20 13 Second part of Table continued on max ige. 1 ot 2 TABLE VI Cont d Run K L M N O P Q R SWater Added, ml. 3.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0Mmoles 187 27.8 55.5 111 167 27.8 55.5 111 167 CH3C 2O, ml. 2.82 5.64 11.23 16.91 OWeight, g 3.06 6.13 32.25 18.38 Mmoles 30 60 120 180 CH3COCl, ml. 2.13 4.26 6.39 8.52Weight, g 2.36 4.71 7.07 9.42Mmoles 30 60 90 120SO3 Titration, meq. 100g 8.2 23.6 32.0 36.4 32.2 36.6 33.8 34.2 21.6Wt. , Sulfur 0.185 0.72 0.875 0.985 0.89 0.845 0.875 0.815 0.22SO3H, meq 100g 5.2 22.5 27.3 30.8 27.8 26.4 27.3 25.5 6.4Conversion ofAcetyl Sulfate, 14 61 74 84 76 72 74 89 19 In 1000 ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved lOOg of a 20 Mooney EPDM used in Examples VIII and IX.The desired amount of water if any was added. Then the desired amount of acetic anhydride if any or acetyl chloride if any was added. To the cement was added 6.34 ml. of 5.90 Molar acetyl sulfate 37.5 mmoles derived from chlorosulfonic acid and acetic anhydride as described in example IX. After 30 minutes the sulfonation cement was inactivated with 150 ml. of zscpropanol, and the free acid was worked up and dried as descriebed in Example VI. The control Run A gave a very high reagent conversion 97 . A possible reason for the very high conver sicn is that the reagent contains acetyl chloride and some acetic anhydride from the generation of the reagent from acetic anhydride and chlorosulfonic acid, and so water effects are negligible. When additional acetic anhydride Runs B, C, D or acetyl chloride Runs E, F, G was added to the cement reagent conversions remained high. blhen 0.5 ml. of warer was added Run H reagent conversion remained high 77 which is due primarily to the acetyl chloride present as a result of reagent generation. However, when. 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ml. cf water was added Runs I, J, K reagent conversion dropped to 20 and below. In the remaining runs, acetic anhydride Runs L,M, N, O and acetyl chloride Runs P, , R, S were added to the cements containing water. In general, reagent conversions were increased to above 70 althcugh Run L 617. andRun S 19 gave lower than expected conversions. Since many modifications and variations of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention thereof, it is not intended to limit the spirit or scope thereof to the specific examples thereof, EXAMPLE XI A 1.0 molar solution of a 1 1 S03 triethyl phosphate TEP complex in 1,2 dichloroethane DCE was prepared by adding 80.1g of liquid S03 1.0 mole to a solution of 182.2g 1.0 mole cf TEP in 787 ml. of DCE. Four cements were prepared as follows intp lOCO ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved lOOg of an ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene copolymer Vistalon 2504 20.The copolymer contained about 50 wt. 7. ethylene and about 5 wt. X 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene. It possessed a Mooney viscosity L 4L, 1 8, 212 F. of about 20. This polymer was produced through the hot extrusion breakdown of commercial 40 Mooney Vistalon 2504 and additionally had been dried on a rubber mill so that little water was contained in the poly mer Into three of the cements was added 0.5 ml., 1.0 ml., and 2.0 ml. of water. Then into each cement at room temperature was added 37.5 ml. of the 1.0 molar. 503 TEP complex 37.5 mmoles . The cements were stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then inactivated with 150 ml. of isopropanol.Antioxidant 2246 0.5g was added, and the acid form of the sulfocared polymer was isolated by steam stripping. The polymer was pulverized and waterwashed in a Waring blender, and the wet crumb was dewatered and dried at about 1200F. ca a two roll rubber mill. Five grams of the sulfonated polymer was dissolved in 100 ml. of 95 toluene 5 methanol, and the solution was titrated with 0.1 N ethanolic NaOH to an Alizarin Thymo phthalein end point. Dietert sulfur determinations were made on each sulfonated polymer. The results are shown inTable VII. Even without the addition of water to the cement, the conversion of the S03 TEP complex was already very low 23 . The addition of water further reduced the sulfur level and further lowered reagent conversion. This example illustrates the deleterious effects of water on the S03 TEP complex.

In all c3ses, acetic anhydride was added to the cement prior to the addition out the sulfonation reagent. Into three of the cements was added 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 ml. or water followed by an amount of acetic anhydride equal to 35 rmnoles plus the number of moles of water added. To each cement was added 37.5 ml. of the 1.0 M SO3 TEP complex described in xa ple XI.The cements were stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then inactivated with 150 ml. isopropanol. The sulfonated polymers were worked up and analyzed as des cried in Example XI Results are shown in Table VII. When sulfonation was effected in the absence of acetic anhydride Control Run I A a reagent conversion of only 23r. was contained. However, when 35 mmoles or acetic anhydride was added to the cement Run II A conversion of the sulfonation complex increased markedly to 95Z. When water had been added to the cement and the cement treated with sufficient acetic anhydride Runs II B, II C, II D the conversion of the reagent still remained high 947., 97 , 79, respectively . This example dramatically illustrates the benefi cial effect of the addition of acetic anhydride added to wet polymer cements on the conversion of S03 TEP sulfonation complexes to polymeric sulfonic acid.EXAMPLE XIII Three sulfonations were effected with the cements and reagents described i. Example I. In two instances, 0.5 ml. and 2.0 ml. of water was added to the cement. Then 37.5 ml. of 1.0 M SO3 TEP in DCE solution 37.5 mmoles was premixed with various amounts of acetic anhydride anc nen the solution was added directly to the cement. The cement was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then inact vated it i50 ml. of isopropanol. The sulfonated polymers were worked up and analyzed as described in Example XI.Results are shown in Table VII. The control Run I A wherein no acetic anhydride was used gave a reagent conversion of only 23 . However, when the reagent was premixed with 56 mmoled of acetic anhydride and then added to the cement, a dramatic increase of regent conversion to 90 was obtained. Similarly, when water had been added to the cement Runs III B, III C the premiyxing of the reagent with sufficient acetic anhydride to counteract the water again maintained a high reagent conver sion. This example shows that in the sulfonation c wet cements with SO3 TEP complexes can be acccmplished with which reagent conversion through the premixing of the reagent with sufficient acetic anhydride to counterbalance all of the water present in the cement. EXAMPLE XIV The four runs described in Example XII were repeated with the exception that the acetic anhydride was replaced wit equimolar amounts of acetyl chloride. The results are shown in Table VII. The addition or 35 mmoles of acetyl chloride to the cement prior to the addition of the SO3 TEP P sulfonation reagent increased tie reagent conversion from 23 Control, jun I A to 82 . When water was added to the cements RunsIV 3, IV C, IV D but sufficient acetyl chloride added to counteract the water reagent conversions remained high. This example illustrates the beneficial effects upon reagent conversion achieved through the addition of acetyl chloride to wet polymer cements in the sulfonation of E DM with SO3 TEP complexes.EXAMPLE XV Two sulfonations were effected as described in Example XI. In one instance Run V B 1.0 ml. of water was added to the cement. Then 37.5 ml. of 1.0 M S03 TEP in DCE solution was premixed with 56 moles Run V A and 91 mmoles Run V B of acetyl chloride. The solutions were added directly to the cements. The cement was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then inactivacad with 150 ml. isopropanol. The sulfonated polymers wee worked up and analyzed as described in Example XI. The results are shown in Table VII. Premixing acetyl chloride with the reagent increased the reagent conversion frcm 237. Control, Run I A to 802. Reagent conversion remained high even when 1 weight water was present. This example demonstrates the sulfonation of wet cements with 503 TSP complexes to high reagent conversion through the premixing of the reagent wich amounts of acetyl chloride sufficient to counteract all of the water in the sulfonation system. EXAMPLE XVI Four EPDM cements were prepared as descrIbed inExample XI. Into 3 of the cements was added 0.5 ml.,1.0 and 2.0 ml. cf water Runs VIII A, VIII B, VIII C . Then into each cement was added 75.0 ml. of 0.5 molar 1 1 S03 p dioxane in DCE 37.5 mmoles . The cements were stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then inactivated with 150 ml. isopropanol. The polymers were worked up and analyzed as described in Example XL The results are shown in table VIII.

The addition of water dropped the conversions to 5L , 45 , and 40 as the water adder to the cement increased 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 , respectively. This example illustrates the deleterious effects of water upon the sulfonation of EPDM with S03 dioxane complebes.EXAMPLE XVII The four runs in Example XVI were repeated except that to each cement was added an amount o acetic anhydride equal 1 to 35 mmoloes plus the number cf moles of water added. The results are shown in Table VIII. In all cases, the reagent conversion. was 90 cr greater. This example demonstrates the sulfonation of wet cenents with SO dioxane complexes to high reagent conver 3 sions through the addition of acetic anhydride to the cement EXAMPLE XVIII Into 1000 ml. of Exxon hexane was dissolved lOOg of an ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene copolymer Vistalon 2504 20. The copolymer contained about 50 wt, ethylene and about 5 wt. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene.It possessed a Mooney viscosity ML 1 8, 2120F. of about 20, This polymer was produced through the hot extrusion breakdown of commercial Vistalon 2504 having a 40 Mooney and additionally had been dried on a hot rubber mill so that little water was contained in the polymer. A benzoyl sulfate solution of 0.75 Polarity was prepared by adding 240g 3.0 moles of sulfur trioxide to a solution of 439.6g 3.6 moles of benzoic acid in 3525 ml. O dry 1,2 dichloroethane. The ratio of benzoic acid S03 was 1.2. Six separate sulfonations were effected by adding various amounts of 0.75 M benzoyl sulfate to the hexane cements at room temperatur0. After 30 minutes, the sulfonations were quenched with 150 ml. isopropanol. The acidic cement was neutralized with 50 aqueous NzOH. Three moles of NaOH was used per mole of benzoyl sulfate. The neutralized cement was steam stripped, the isolated polymer pulverized and water washed in a Waring blender, and the wet crumb dewatered and dried on a hot rubber mill. Sulfur analyses were obtained on the products according to theDietert method. The results of the benzoyl acetate sulfonation of PDM are shown in Table IX. A wide range of sulfonate levels was introduced into the EPDM. Over this range the conversions of benzoyl sulfate to polymeric sulfonic acid were 89 94 . These results illustrate the high conversions obtainable in commercial hexane solvent in the sulfonation of EPDM with benzoyl sulfate.

A 4.84 Molar neat acetic sulfate was prepared by slow y adding concentrated sulfuric acid to acetic anhydride at acut oec. at an acetic anhydride H2SO4 molar ratio of 1.62. The thick reagent was permitted to warm to 10 C. before samples were withdrawn for sulfonation. To the EPDM cement in n heptane was added 10.3 ml. 50 mmoles of neat acetyl sulfate at room temperature. The si nation mixture was stirred fcr 60 minutes and then quenched with 100 ml. of ispropanol. The polymeric sulfonic acid was isolated by steam stripping, pulverizing and waterwashing the isolated polymer in a Waring blender, and dewatering and drying the wet crumb on a rubber mill at about 110 F. The polymeric sulfonic acid was cnalyzed for free acid by dissolving 5.0 g. of the polymer in 95 mi. toluene 5 ml. methanol and titrating the resultant solution with 0.1N ethanolic sodium hydroxide to an alizarin thymophthalein endpoint. The polymer contained 41.6 meg. of free acid par lOOg of polymer. Lf all the acid is due to sulfonic acid, the conversion of reagent to sulfonic acid is 86 . Dietert sulfur analysis showed the polymer to contain 1.27 wt. sulfur which corresponds to an 827. conversion of acetyl sulfate. The polymeric free acid was formulated and converted to the magnesium sulfonate ionomer according to the following recipe Polymer 100 SRF Carbon Black 75 FEF Carbon Black 75 Flexon 845 Oil 100 Magnesium Stearate 35Micropads were molded for 10 minutes at 3500F., and the following tensile properties were determined At 250C.

Additionally. the polymeric sulfonic acid obtained therefrom is readily formulated and converted to an ionomer time excellent physical properties.EXAMPLE XX ExampleXiX was repeated except that the reagent acetyl sulfate was generated in situ by charging 7.66 ml. 81 mmoles of aceria anhydride to the n heptane cement followed by 2.80 ml. 50 mmoles of concentrated sulfuric acid. Titration showed an acid content of 39.6 meq. lOOg polymer. The Dietert sulfur content was l.34 wt, which corresponds to a sulfonic acid content of 41.9 meq . lOOg polymer and a sulfuric acid acetyl sulfate conversion of 872. When compounded and molded as described in ExampleXIX the formulation had the following tensile properties At 250C. At 1000C. Tensile Strength, psi, 1090 360 Elongation, Z 260 , 360 These results in combination with those of ExampleXIX illustrate the use of n heptane solvent In the sulfonation of EPDM with acetyl sulfate which is either performed or generated in situ.EXAMPLE XXI The effect of reaction time on sulfonation was examined. Four cements were prepared by dissolving 500g of the Vistalon 2504 20 described in Exam. XVIII in 5555 ml.of n heptane. Sulfonations were effected at room temperature by charging first to the cement 28,7 ml. 304.0 mmoles of acetic anhydride followed by 10.5 ml. 187.5 mmoles of concentrated sulfuric acid. Reactions were permitted to proceed for 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes and then quenched with isopropanol. The polymeric sulfonic acids were isolated and analyzed as described in Example XIX.

The cements were sulfonated to four sulfonic acid levels with in situ acetyl sulfate, i.e. through the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to the EPDM cement containing acetic anhydride. The results are shown inTable XI.

EXAMPLE XXIII Four identical su fonation runs were made in E acon commercial heptane. The EPDM described in Ex. XVIII 500g was dissolved in 500 ml. of Exxon heptane and 28.7 ml 304 mmoles of acetic anhydride was added to the cement. Sulfon ation was then effected by slowly adding at room temperature 10.52 ml. 188 mmoles of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes the reaction was quenched with 200 ml. isopropanol. The polymeric sulfonic acid was isolated and dried as described in Example XIX and the product was analyzed for sul fur. The S03H cntents were 31.6, 32.2, 30.9, and 31.6 meq lOOg polymer for an average of 31.6 meq 500g. This corres ponds to an 867. conversion of acetyl sulfate to sulfonic acid. These results demonstrate the effective use of commercial heptane in the sulfonatlon of EPDM.EXAMPLE XXIV Five identical EPDM sulfonations were effected in a 100 gallon glass lined kettle. The EPDM described inEx. XVIII 56.7 pounds was dissolved in 388 pounds ofExxon heptane. Acetic anhydride 3.52 pounds was added at room temperature followed by 2.20 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes the sulfonation was quenched with 67.1 pounds of isopropanol. A sample was taken for sulfur analysis. Stearic acid 14.5 pounds was added to the cement and the cement was stirred until the stearic acid dissolved. The cement was then neutralized with a solution of 5.60 pounds of zinc acetate dihydrate in 14.2 pounds of water. Antioxidant 2246 0.284 pounds w. added and the cement stirred for another 30 minutes. Tlie final cement was easy to handle, pump and clean. The neutralized and plasticized sulfonated EPDM was steam stripped in an efficiently stirred 30 gallon ste2msstripper which isolated the product as a fine wet crumb. The wet crumb was dewatered and dried with a 1.5 inch Welding Engineers dewatering extruder equipped with a single adjustable orifice die plate. It was steam heated at 100 psig of steam. The temperature of the steam was about 1750 C. The die plate was electrically heated at 1570 C. The material emerged as a blown strand containing about I wt. 7. moisture. According to the Dietert sulfur analysis obtained on the free acid samples, the five runs contained 34.3, 33.0, 32.5, 33.3, and 33.8 meq. SO3H lOOg of polymer for an average of 33.4 meq. lOOg. This corresponds to an average conversion of 92 of sulfuric acid acetyi sulfate to sulfuric acid. These runs demonstrate that high quality ionomers can be prepared in larger scale equipment when sulfonation of EPDM is conducted in commercial Exxon heptane. The materials produced could easily bè handled and mixed with extender oils, mineral fillers, carbon blacks and other additives on rubber mills and large and small Banburys.The formulations could be injection molded and extruded into useful end products such as sneakers, garden hose, etc.EXAMPLE XXV A 1500 gallon glass lined reactor was charged with 4880 pounds of Exxon hexane and then 680.4 pounds of theEPDM described in Ex. XVIII. After solution had occurred 17.76 pounds of acetic anhydride was charged in. At room temperature 26.4 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid was added slowly. The cement was stirred for 30 minutes and then 802 pounds of isopropanol was added. Samples were obtained and worked up for sulfur analysis. Analysis showed the sulfonated polymer to contain 31.9 meq. of sulfonic acid per 1 0 Og of polymer. This corresponds to a conversion of sulfuric acid acetyl sulfate to sulfonic acid of 879,. Stearic acid 174.2 pounds was charged in, and the cement was stirred until the stearic acid dissolved.The acid cement was then neutralized with a solution of 67.4 pounds of zinc acetate dehydrate in 170.4 pounds of water. The resultant neutralized cement stirred very readily under the conditions and produced a very homogeneous cement. Antioxidant 2246 3.4 pounds was stirred in. The cement was transferred to a 55 gallon stainless steel drum by gravity feed. The kettle emptied easily, and the draining of the walls was excellent. Rinsing the walls down with toluene m.eth.anol solutions produced a clean kettle The drums were fitted with a Graco Monark 5 1 ratio pump Model oO6 393 which possesses a maximum pump delivery with continuous duty of 2.5 gallons minute. The neutralized cement was steam stripped at the rate of 50 70 gallons hour by pumping the neutralized cement into a continuous steam stripper whose main drum was 200 gallons in size. By suitable adjustment of the feed rate, agitation, hold up time and hot water temperature about 85CC. an easily handled, non sticking crumb could be collected. The wet crumb was dewatered and dried as described in Example XXIV. This run demonstrates that high quality neutralized and plasticized sulfonated EPDM can be produced in commercial size equipment with the use of commercial Exxon hexane as the sulfonation solvent.EXAMPLE XXVI Four cements were prepared from Exxon hexane and the EPDM described in Ex. XVIII at a concentration of 100g liter. Various amounts of acetyl chloride were added to the cements. Concentrated sulfuric acid 2.10 ml. 37.5 mmoles H2SO4 was dripped in at room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Reaction was terminated with 100 ml. methanol, and 0.5g Antioxidant 2246 was added. The polymers were worked up and analyzed as described in Example XIX. Results are gJen in Table XII. Very high conversions of sulfuric acid acetyl sulfate are obtained when hexane solvent is used for the sulfonation of EPDM with in situ reagent derived from con centrated sulfuric acid and acetyl chloride. EXAMPLE XXVII AcetyL sulfate sulfonation reagent was generated from chlorosulfonic acid by slowly adding 19.86 ml. 300 mmoles of chlorosulfonic acid to 30.99 ml. 330 moles at a temperature below 0 C. After mixing the thick homo geneous reagent was permitted to warm to 100C. before sampling for sulfonation. The reagent is 5.9 Molar in acetyl sulfate. A cement was prepared by dissolving the EPDM describesd in Ex. XVIII in Exxon hexane at a concentration of lOOg liter. At room temperature was added 6.34 ml. of 5.90M acetyl sulfate 37.5 mmoles described above.

The free acld of the polymer was iso lated and dried as dried in Example XLY. This example demonstrates the use of ac. .tyl sul fate derived from acetic anhydride and chlorosulfonic acid in the sulfonation of EPDM in commercial hexane. EXAMPLE XXVIII Commercial Vistalon 2504 was sulfonatsd in this example. Some material was dried thoroughly il a rubber mill at 300 F. and some was used as received. Vistalon 2504 contains about 50 weight 7. ethylene and about 5 weight ENB and possesses a Mooney Viscosity ML 1 8, 212 F. of about 40. Benzene cements of each of the aaterials were prepared at a concentration of 100 g. EIDM 1500 ml. benzene. Three neat acetyl sulfate reagents were prepared as described in Example XIX at acetic anhydride H2SO4 ratios of 1.26 Molarity 5.36 , 1.39 Molarity 5.36 , and 1.59 Molarity 4.86 . Three benzene cements each of of as received and the mill dried materials were sulfonated with 37.5 mmoles each of the above acetyl sulfate reagents at room temperature for 30 minutes The suflonations were quenched with 150 ml. isopropanol and 0.5 g. Antioxidant 2246 was added. Polymer work up and analysis was as described in Example XIX.Results are given in Table XIII. Over the range of acetic hydride H2SO4 ratios sulfonation of the as received ET.4 in benzene solvent gave reagent conversions below 50Z. Le mill dried EPDM gave slightly higher reagent conversions but only about 507.. These data show that water is not responsible for the low conversions of preformed acetyl sulfate to sulfonic acid.Apparently acetyl sulfate reacts to a substantial degree with the benzene. As a consequence benzene is not con sidered a suitable solvent for the sulfonation of EPDM with acetyl sulfate.EXAMPLE XXIX T3 2000 ml. of 112 dichloroethane was added lpO g.of commercial Vistalon 2504, described in Example XXVIII.Solution of the polymer did not occur after extended agitation at about 500C. Apparently 1,2 dichloroethane is too polar a solvent for the non polar EPDM. This solvent is not suitable for EPDM sulfonation.

XVIII in 1000 ml of cyclokexan . To the cements were added 60.75 and 86.25 mmoles of acetic anhydride. At room temperature was added 37.5 mmoles of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the sulfonation mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Sulfonation was terminated through the. addition of 150 ml. isopropanol, and 0.5 g. of Antioxidant 2246 was added. The polymeric acid was isolated, dried, and titrated as described in Example XIX. Results are given in Table XIV Runs A and B . The results show that excellent conversions of in situ acetyl sulfate to sulfonic acid are obtained in the sulfonation of EPDM in cyclohexane solvent. Cyclohexane is an excellent solvent for the sulfonation of EPDM.EXAMPLE XXXI Example XXX was repeated except that tetrahydrofuran was used as the solvent The results are given inTable XIV Runs C and D . At both acetic anhydride H2S04 ratios of 1.62 and 2.30 the reagent conversions were extremely low. It is apparent that tetrahydrofuran is either reactive with acetyl sulfate and other sulfonation reagents or inhibits sulfonation to such an extent that it thereby cannot be considered a suitable solvent for sulfonation.EXAMPLE XXXII To 1000 ml. of amyl acetate AA was added 100 g.of the EPDM described in Ex. XVIII. No solution cccurred after extended heating and vigorous agitation. This ester and the more polar lower molecular weight esters are thereby unsuitable as the sole solvents in the sulfonation of EPDM.EXAMPLE XXXIII In view of the incompatibility of EPDM in amylace tate two cements were prepared by dissolving 100 g. of the EPDM In Example oYVIII in 500 ml. of Exxon hexane and 500 ml.of amyl acetate. Two sulfonations were effected as described in Example XXX. The results are given in Table VI RunsF and G . Conversions of the in situ acetyl sulfate were 22 and 36 . at acetic anhydride i2S04 ratios of 1.62 and 2.30, respectively. The amyl acetate is either reactive with acetyl sulfate or inhibits slfonation to such an extent that it cannot be considered a suitable sulfonation solvent. The improved process as embodied in the aforementioned examples, for the preparation of a gel free neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, clearly defines a method of obtaining at least 702 conversions which was not previously obtainable. Since many modifications and variations of the process of this invention may be made without departing from the spitit and scope of the invention thereof, it is not intended to limit the scope or spirit thereof to the specific examples thereof.
