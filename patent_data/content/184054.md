# RAIL APPARATUS

## Abstract
A rail apparatus 1 includes rails TR, LR each having a running surface 51 and a groove 52 formed on the running surface, both extending in a longitudinal direction of each rail, the running surfaces intersecting with each other on the same plane, whereby a running member 20 having running wheels 30 rotating on the running surfaces can run along the rails, each running wheel having an annular flange 32 which is provided on an outer peripheral tread surface 31 thereof and which is engageable with the grooves of the rails. The rail apparatus further includes an elevation 62 provided on a bottom 53 of the groove 52 at a cross portion of the rails, which come into contact with an outer peripheral surface of the flange of the running wheel upon passing therethrough.
