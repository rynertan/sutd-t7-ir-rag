# Mineral enrichment composition.

## Abstract
Mineral containing polymeric compositions of matter having high aqueous dispersibility, and methods of syn thesizing the same, are disclosed which permit nutritionally important elements such as calcium, magnesium, phos phorus, potassium, iron and certain trace elements to be added in aqueous form to foods of all types without ad versely affecting taste qualities. The compositions generally are high molecular weight species having moieties of the generalized formula
