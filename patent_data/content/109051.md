# IMMUNE COMPLEX ISOLATION

## Abstract
To diagnose diseases in patients, a protein complex, RhC. is prepared from horse serum by precipitating a white powder from the serum at a pH of 5.5 and processing to re move lipids at a pH of 8.2 using Tris HCl as the buffer. It in cludes two components bound together to provide a molecu lar weight of 280.000 and having characteristics of a rheuma toid factor and a Clq like subcomponent of the complement. The protein complex is incubated with human serum or plasma and then precipitated by dialysis against a high pH buffer 0.5 M Tris HCl pH 8.2 . When precipitated it. co precipitates the immune complexes from the human blood serum without sub stantial monomeric immunoglobulin to quantitatively isolate immune complexes from serum immunological assays then determine how much immune complex and what kind were in the serum.
