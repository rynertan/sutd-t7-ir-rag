# Magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape cassette has a front opening 7 which when the cassette is not in use is covered by a pivotal front cover 20 and a sliding plate 9 which is situated on the outside of the cassette housing 1 adjacent the bottom wall 2 thereof. In the closed position the sliding plate covers the front opening 7 at the bottom and a part of the magnetic tape 18a which extends across said opening. The top wall 3 of the housing is imperforate and is contiguous with the front cover in the closed position of the cover. In the closed position the sliding plate 9 extends from the front of the cassette housing 1 beyond openings 4 in the bottom wall 2 to cover these openings. The sliding plate is formed with two apertures 15 which expose the openings 4 in the open position of the sliding plate 9 . In the closed position the sliding plate 9 is latched by means of at least one latching member 27 which comprises a latching portion 29 and an actuating portion 30 , the latter projecting into a slot or groove 32 in the sliding plate 9 near the rear end of the slot or groove when this plate 9 is in the closed position.
