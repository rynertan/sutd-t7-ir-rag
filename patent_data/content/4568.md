## Description
Process for recovering sulphuric acid from natural gyp sum or phospho gypsum This invention relates to the production of sulphuric acid from phospho gypsum and or natural gypsum. More particularly it relates to a new method for production of sulphur dioxide SO2 , calcium oxide CaO and ferric oxide Fe2O3 directly from a mixture of pyrite and phospho gypsum and or natural gypsum. The huge quantities of gypsum CaSO4.2H20 produced as by products in the production of phosphoric acid and various phosphate fertilizets are major problems in the industry of phosphate fertilizers all over the world. The only known industrial process for the utilization of such huge quantities of phospho gypsum is the Muller Kuhne method which depends on the decomposition of gypsum with coal and clay and involves the reduction of gypsum to calcium sulphide which reacts with calcium sulphate to give sulphur dioxide and calcium oxide which is removed as cement through reaction with the added clay. This method suffers many major drawbacks including inter alia, large capital investments, availability of coal and clay near the site, numerous troubles and problems of maintenance and operation. It is an object of this invention to overcome these problems and to provide a new method for the utilization of phospho gypsum to produce directly sulphur dioxide, calcium oxide and iron oxide, through use of pyrite. Other objects and advantages will be apparent from or referred to in the following detailed description. As a result of extensive experiments carried out by the inventor on the decomposition of gypsum by using natural sulphides it has been found that such na tural sulphides mainly the iron pyrites may be used as decomposing agent for gypsum to produce direetly S02, and mixtures of CaO and Fe203. Iron pyrites consist mainly of FeS2 which when mixed with the phospho gypsum or natural gypsum and resulting mixture burned at a suitable temperature for a sufficient period of time gives directly S02, CaO and Fe203. The factors studied in experiments of the invention included the ratio of gypsum to pyrite, the temperature of reaction and the time necessary for the decomposition. All these studies were carried out with the use of pyrite and gypsum having the following analyses. In these studies the two raw materials were well mixed and subjected to the desired conditions.
