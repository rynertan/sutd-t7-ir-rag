# Thrust bearing assemblies.

## Abstract
A carrier member 50 having formed therein an annular slot 4, 66 , receives a plurality of bearing members, which may be thrust pads 10 or guide members 60 , within said slot 4, 66 . Each bearing member 10, 60 has a radially outer surface 16, 72 and an opposed radially inner surface 18, 74 , two spaced regions 20, 22 or 76, 78 of said radially outer surface 16, 72 making bearing contact with the associated radially outer sidewall 8, 70 of the annular slot 4, 66 , and a region 24, 80 of said radially inner surface 16, 72 of the bearing member 10, 60 making bearing contact with the associated radially inner sidewall 6, 68 of the annular slot 4, 66 . Said bearing contacts prevent, for each bearing member 10, 60 relative to the carrier member 50 , both radial movement and rotational movement about an axis through the bearing members 10, 60 , and are such that the bearing members 10, 60 are capable of being fitted into slots 4, 66 within a wide range of curvatures.
