## Description
The present invention relates to a circular polarization reflector. More particularly, it is concerned with a circular polarization reflector comprising a thermoplastic resin layer or other paint coating layer having good weather resistance and an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin layer with a metallic layer sandwiched therebetween. Space communications using a geostationary satellite, including transmissions of such as high quality TV signals, still image signals, PCM audio signals and or facsimile signals, are beginning to be put into practical use in many countries of the world see However, if a circular polarization is used for the satellite communication, the channel discrimination can be easily achieved by merely directing an antenna to a desired satellite correctly. Such adjustment of the direction of the receiving antenna is very easy compared with the case of the linear polarization. For this reason, in future satellite communication systems, the circular polarization is expected to be generally used. Conventionally used circular polarization antennas include those of a conical horn type, a dipole type comprising two dipoles combined together orthogonally, and a parabola type using any of the above type antenna as a primary radiator. In general, the parabolic antenna is made of a metallic plate or metallic net. Since, however, the metal is subjected to corrosion, it is necessary to use anticorrosive alloys or to apply anticorrosive coating. These anticorrosive alloys, however, are expensive. In the case of applying an anticorrosive coating, it is necessary to apply repeated coatings in order to provide satisfactory anticorrosion properties. This results in high production costs. Furthermore, if such an antenna is used for long periods of time, the coating is deteriorated. An attempt has been made to produce a wave reflecting plate comprising a thermohardening resin e.g., an unsaturated polyester resin layer and a glass fiber layer, the surface of which has been metallized as a wave reflecting layer see U.S. Patents 4,188,358 and 3,536,800 . This is complicated in a method of production and, furthermore, it is very difficult to produce a wave reflecting layer having a uniform thickness, i.e., having no irregularity in thickness. The object of the present invention is to provide a circular polarization reflector which can be produced in a simplified manner, and which has good wave reflection performance that can be maintained for long periods of time. It has been found that these objects can be attained by sandwiching a metallic layer between specific thermoplastic resin layers. Thus, the present invention is directed to a circular polarization reflector as specified in claim 1.

The reflector of the present invention has the following advantages. The present invention is hereinafter explained in more detail. Thermoplastic resins I are used in the preparation of the thermoplastic resin layer A of the reflector of the present invention. These thermoplastic resins I are industrially produced and widely used, and their methods of production and physical properties are well known. The molecular weight varies with the type of the thermoplastic resin in general, it is from 10,000 to 1,000,000. Typical examples of the thermoplastic resins I include homopolymers of monomers containing a double bond, such as ethylene, propylene, vinylidene fluoride, vinyl chloride, and styrene, copolymers comprising at least 50 by weight of the above monomers, an acrylonitrile styrene copolymer an AS resin , a resin comprising mainly methyl methacrylate an MMA resin , graft copolymers prepared by graft copolymerization of styrene, solely or in combination with vinyl compounds e.g., acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate , onto rubbers e.g., a butadiene rubber, an acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, a styrene butadiene rubber, an acryl rubber, an ethylene propylene rubber EPR , an ethylene propylene diene copolymer EPDM , and chlorinated polyethylene , a polyamide resin, a polyester resin, a polyphenylene oxide resin, and a polycarbonate resin. In addition, resins resulting from modification, such as graft polymerization, of the above thermoplastic resins with organic compounds containing at least one double bond e.g., unsaturated carboxylic acids and their anhydrides can be used, and are often preferable as being superior in moldability. In particular, modified resins prepared by graft polymerization of organic compounds containing at least one double bond in particular, unsaturated carboxylic acids and their anhydrides onto olefin polymer resins an ethylene homopolymer, a propylene homopolymer, and copolymers made mainly of ethylene and or propylene are desirable, in that if the thermoplastic resin layer is made of compositions containing the modified resins or the modified resins alone, it exhibits superior adhesiveness to the metallic layer. Furthermore, compositions prepared by adding the above rubbers to the thermoplastic resins I the amount of the rubber added is usually 40 by weight or less can be used. Of the thermoplastic resins I , fluorine containing resins such as polyvinylidene fluoride are desirably used because of their superior weather resistance. In addition, compositions of resins made mainly of vinyl chloride or resins made mainly of ethylene and or propylene, with ultraviolet absorbers as described hereinafter are preferably used because the addition of such ultraviolet absorbers enables improvement of the weather resistance of these resins. Ultraviolet absorbers are additives to be used to protect thermoplastic resins against modification, deterioration, or breakdown due to the action of ultraviolet rays. As these ultraviolet absorbers, compounds capable of absorbing ultraviolet rays can be used. Typical examples of these ultraviolet absorbers include salicylic acid derivatives such as phenyl salicylate, p octylphenyl salicylate, and p tertbutylphenyl salicylate benzophenone compounds such as 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone, 2,2 dihydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone, and 4 dodecyloxy 2 hydroxybenzophenone benzotriazole compounds such as 2 2 hydroxy 3 tert butyl 5 methylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 di tert butyl phenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, and 2 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxyphenyl benzotriazole oxalic anilide derivatives hindered amine type compounds benzoic acid derivatives and nickel chelate compounds. Physical properties of these ultraviolet absorbers are described along with their trade names in The fluorine containing resins are homopolymers or copolymers prepared by polymerization or copolymerization of fluorine compounds having 2 or 3 carbon atoms and one double bond e.g., vinylidene fluoride, ethylene trifluoride, and ethylene tetrafluoride in the presence of peroxides. In the case of the copolymers, the fluorine compound content is at least 50 mol . The acrylonitrile styrene copolymer an AS resin is prepared by copolymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile, the molar ratio of styrene to acrylonitrile being 2 1 to 5 1, in the presence of peroxides or azo compounds. These fluorine containing resins and acrylonitrile styrene copolymers are well known, produced industrially, and widely used in various fields see Encyclopedia , Vol. 7, pp. 179 219 1967 . The other resins described above may also be used as the thermoplastic resin II and are explained in detail in the section of Thermoplastic Resins II below indicated with . Paints produced industrially and used widely as paints for metals can be used in the preparation of the metallic layer with a coating layer having good weather resistance. Their methods of preparation and physical properties are well known see Encyclopedia , Vol. 13, p. 486 . These paints can be divided into solvent type paints using organic solvents such as toluene and xylene, aqueous emulsion type paints, and nonsolvent type paints. Any desired type of paint can be chosen, depending on the coating method. Typical examples of these paints include unsaturated or saturated polyester resin based paints, polyurethane resin based paints prepared by reacting polyester polyol, polyether polyol, or polyurethane polyol with diisocyanates, aminoalkyd resin based paints, acryl resin based paints, melamine resin based paints, epoxy resin based paints, silicone resin based paints, vinyl chloride resin based paints, acrylurethane resin based paints, amide resin based paints, fluorine containing resin based paints e.g., vinylidene fluoride resin based paints , alkyd resin based paints, vinylidene chloride resin based paints, chlorinated polypropylene resin based paints, xylene resin based paints, cumarone resin based paints, petroleum resin based paints, phenol resin based paints, butyral resin based paints, and vinyl acetate resin based paints. To these paints can be added delustering agents e.g., silicic acid , colorants e.g., pigments and dyes , antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, and so forth. Of the above described paints, polyurethane resin based paints, acryl resin based paints, epoxy resin based paints, silicone resin based paints, aminoalkyd resin based paints, and vinylidene fluoride resin based paints are desirable to use since they are superior in weather resistance. It is preferred that antioxidants and ultraviolet absorbers be compounded to the paints of the present invention, since this also contributes to the formation of paints having good weather resistance. The above noted solvents for the solvent type paints are substances generally used as solvents for organic compounds such as ketones e.g., diacetone alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone , alcohols e.g., n butyl alcohol , esters e.g., ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and cellosolve acetate , aromatic, aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons e.g., toluene, xylene, hexane, petroleum ether, and cyclohexane , and chlorinated hydrocarbons e.g., trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, α chloronaphthalene, and chlorotoluene . Preferred are those solvents which are liquid under the conditions of a temperature of from 0 to 50 C and atmospheric pressure, and having a boiling point of 300 C or less under atmospheric pressure. The solvent to be used is determined appropriately depending on the type of paints used. Resins for paints which are to be used in the present invention are described below in further detail. Acryl resins can be divided into two groups thermoplastic resins made mainly of acrylic or methacrylic acid esters and thermosetting acryl resins obtained by reacting or suspending a styrene based copolymer having a reactive functional group e.g., a carboxyl group, a hydroxy group, an amido group, a methylol group, an epoxy group, and a glycidyl group at its side chain with or in a thermoplastic resin made mainly of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or esters thereof.

They are prepared by condensation of polybasic acids such as phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and tetrahydrophthalic acid, and polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin and pentaerythritol. Alkyd resins in which part of the polybasic acid component is replaced by maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, and tetrachlorophthalic anhydride can be used. In addition, those resins prepared by modification using vegetable oils such as linseed oil, tung oil, castor oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, and coconut oil can be used. They are commercially available in the form of solutions prepared using solvents such as toluene, xylene, mineral spirit, naphtha, or their mixtures, in which the resin content is from 50 to 70 by weight.

Epoxy resins are generally prepared by condensing epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A at a temperature ranging from 90 to 120 C in the presence of sodium hydroxide. The bond of the main chain is an ether bond. The average molecular weight is usually from about 300 to 400 for liquid resins, from about 900 to 4,000 for solid resins, and about 280 to 560 for ring like aliphatic resins. The epoxy equivalent value is generally from 180 to 200 for liquid resins, from 450 to 3,000 for solid resins, and from about 150 to 160 for ring like aliphatic resins. In general, the epoxy resins are used in the form of solutions in solvents such as ketones e.g., methyl ketone and ethyl ketone , diacetone alcohol, cellosolve, butyl acetate, cellosolve acetate, toluene, and xylene. In cases wherein the epoxy resins are used as paints, it is preferred for them to be used in the form of two component type paints wherein the epoxy resin and a hardener such as amines e.g., diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, and methaphenylenediamine or polyamide are dissolved in the respective solvents selected from the above described solvents. Vinylidene chloride resins are copolymers of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile or acrylic or methacrylic acid esters the acrylic or methacrylic acid content is generally from 10 to 40 by weight , and the average degree of polymerization is from 50 to 1,000. These vinylidene chloride resins can be divided into two types solvent type and latex type.

The average degree of polymerization is from 100 to 800. These vinyl chloride resins can be divided into two groups solvent type and latex type. Usually they are used in a state that they are dissolved in a mixed solvent of ketone and toluene or butyl acetate and toluene. Chlorinated polypropylene resins are prepared by chlorination of polypropylene. It is available in the form of a powdered resin, or a solvent type resin.

Xylene resins are prepared by reacting xylene and formaldehyde in the presence of sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Those resins modified with phenols and rosins, for example, can also be used. In the case of a liquid xylene resin, its viscosity as an 80 toluene solution at 20 C is from 2 to 3 poises, and in the case of a solid resin, its viscosity as a 50 xylene solution at 20 C is from 0.2 to 1 poise. Cumarone resins are prepared by copolymerizing cumarone and or indene with styrene. The average degree of polymerization is from 500 to 1,500, the softening point is from 90 to 150 C, and the iodine value is from 15 to 60. In general, hydrocarbons, ketones, esters and chlorinated hydrocarbons are used as solvents. Petroleum resins are produced by decomposition of a feed oil, and their properties vary depending on various conditions. In general, the softening point is from 80 to 110 C, the iodine value is from 20 to 300, and the acid value is 1 or less. In general, these petroleum resins are produced by polymerizing styrene, alkylstyrene, divinylbenzene, cyclopentadiene, and indene, for example, in residual olefins having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms in the presence of a Friedel Craft catalyst e.g., AℓCℓ₃, AℓBr₃, BF₃, SnCℓ₂, and ZnCℓ₂ . Phenol resins include oil insoluble resins produced by condensation of phenol or para substituted phenol substituted by alkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl having from 8 or less carbon atoms and formaldehyde in the presence of acid catalysts, oil soluble phenol resins modified with rosin and further esterified with glycerin, 100 oil soluble phenol resins prepared by reacting phenol resins substituted by an alkyl or aryl group in the para or ortho position, and formaldehyde, resol type phenol resins prepared by condensation of para or ortho substituted phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of alkali catalysts, and alcohol soluble resins prepared in the same manner as in the preparation of the above resol type phenol resins with the exception that the reaction is stopped in the condition that the resol type phenol resin is soluble in alcohols. In general, the softening point of the rosin modified resin is from 110 to 170 C, and its acid value is from 10 to 25. The softening point of the 100 oil soluble phenol resin is from 75 to 135 C, and its acid value is 100 or more. Silicone resins are produced by hydrolysis of silane compounds having a lower alkyl group containing 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group. The viscosity at 20 C is from 20 to 1,000 cps. These silicone resins are preferably used in the present invention because they are superior in water resistance, weather resistance, and heat resistance. Toluene and xylene, for example, are used as solvents. Amide resins are prepared by condensation of polyamines e.g., ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine and dimers dibasic acids as obtained by polymerization of unsaturated fatty acids , and are polymers containing an amide group of CO NH in the molecule. The amine value is usually from 45 to 175 for solution type resins, from 180 to 400 for liquid resins, and from 75 to 120 for semi solid resins. The softening point is from 90 to 190 C for solid resins, and from 20 to 50 C for semi solid resins. In general, mixed solvents of alcohols and cellosolves with xylene or toluene, for example, are used. Butyral resins are also called polyvinyl butyral and are prepared by butyralation of polyvinyl alcohol produced from vinyl acetate resins as described hereinafter. In general, the average degree of polymerization is from 250 to 2,000, and the degree of butyralation is from 57 to 70 mol . They generally contain vinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate in the molecule. The viscosity as a 10 solution in a 1 1 mixture of ethyl alcohol and toluene is from 10 to 150 cps at 25 C. Vinyl acetate resins are polyvinyl acetate and copolymers composed mainly of vinyl acetate. Polyvinyl alcohol is prepared by saponification of such vinyl acetate resins with acids or alkalis usually sodium hydroxide , and the degree of saponification is generally more than 85 . Polyvinyl alcohol, however, is not very desirable to use because of its poor weather resistance. Unsaturated polyester resins are prepared by reacting unsaturated dibasic acids such as maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, chlorinated maleic acid, and chlorendic anhydride with glycols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, and bisphenol dioxyethyl ether, and, if desired, further with saturated dibasic acids such as phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, 3,6 endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic anhydride, adipic acid, and sebacic acid in an inert gas, usually at 160 to 230 C, to prepare esters, quenching the esters below 100 C, adding polymerization inhibitors to the esters, further cooling the resulting mixture, and then dissolving it in polymerizable monomers such as styrene, vinyltoluene, methyl methacrylate, and diallylphthalate usually styrene . The acid value of the unsaturated polyester is usually 30 or less, and its viscosity at 25 C is from 1 to 9 poises. Melamine resins are prepared by reacting melamine and formaldehyde, with the molar ratio of melamine to formaldehyde being 1 6, in an alkaline condition pH 8 or more to prepare methylolmelamine, and then heating the methylolmelamine in alcohols usually alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and desirably butyl alcohol in the presence of a small amount of acids or acidic substances as a catalyst. Vinylidene fluoride resins are polymers made mainly at least 50 mol of vinylidene fluoride, and they are preferably used in the form of dispersion in solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Polyurethane resins are resins containing a number of urethane bonds represented by NH COO . They are divided into three groups two component type polyurethane paints in which polyesters or polyethers are used in combination with isocyanate compounds, moisture hardenable polyurethanes, and urethanated oils. The above polyesters are prepared by reacting organic dibasic acids e.g., adipic acid, sebacic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid, phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, suberic acid, dimeric acid, and glutaric acid with glycols e.g., ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, hexanetriol, trimethylene glycol, glycerin and sorbitol . The polyethers are polymers of the above glycols. Examples of the isocyanate compounds are trilene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylenemethane diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and xylylene diisocyanate. Moisture hardenable polyurethane of the above polyurethane resins is undesirable in that since it undergoes a hardening reaction on absorbing moisture in the air, it is very sensitive to moisture and readily forms pinholes or bubbles. For the reasons as described above, two component type polyurethane paints and urethanated oils prepared by reacting drying oils e.g., soybean oil, linseed oil and castor oil with the above polyesters or polyethers and further with isocyanate compounds are preferred. Aminoalkyd resin based paints are prepared by diluting a mixture of melamine and alkyd resins as described above with solvents such as butyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, toluene, and xylene, with the mixture comprising from 15 to 30 by weight of the melamine resin and from 85 to 70 by weight of the alkyd resin.

These metallic layers may be untreated or may be subjected to surface treatment s , such as chemical treatment and plating treatment. In addition, metallic layers which are coated or printed can also be used. Of the above metals, aluminum, copper, silver and alloys made mainly at least 50 by weight of these metals are desirable because of their superior wave reflection performance. Particularly preferred are aluminum, copper, and alloys made mainly of the aluminum and copper. Thermoplastic resins II are used in the preparation of the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin layer C of the present invention. Typical examples of the thermoplastic resins II are shown below. Olefin polymers polyamide resins polycarbonate resins styrene polymers graft polymers resulting from graft polymerization of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound to chlorinated polyethylene or a mixture of chlorinated polyethylene and a copolymer of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound hereinafter referred to as impact resistant resins A impact resistant resins prepared by graft copolymerization of at least one vinyl compound selected from the group consisting of styrene, acrylonitrile, and methyl methacrylate to at least one rubber selected from the group consisting of butadiene rubber, acrylate rubber and ethylene propylene rubber these impact resistant resins are hereinafter referred to as impact resistant resins B methyl methacrylate polymers, phenylene oxide polymers, aromatic polyesters, oxymethylene polymers and vinyl chloride polymers.

Olefin polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention include an ethylene homopolymer, a propylene homopolymer, an ethylene propylene copolymer, and copolymers of ethylene and or propylene and other α olefins having 12 or less carbon atoms the proportion of the α olefin is generally 20 by weight or less . The melt index as determined according to ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of 190 C under a load of 2.16 kg or melt flow index as determined according to ASTM 1238 at a temperature of 230 C under a load of 2.16 kg of the olefin polymer is preferably from 0.01 to 100 g 10 min and more preferably from 0.02 to 80 g 10 min. If M.I. or MFI is less than 0.01 g 10 min, the resulting mixture is poor in moldability. On the other hand, if an olefin polymer having an M.I. or MFI of more than 100 g 10 min is used, the ultimate mold has poor mechanical properties. An ethylene homopolymer, copolymers of ethylene and a small amount of α olefins as described above, a propylene homopolymer, and random or block copolymers of propylene, ethylene and or other α olefins are desirable. These olefin polymers are produced by homo or copolymerizing olefins by the use of a catalyst system comprising a transition metal compound and an organoaluminum compound a so called Ziegler catalyst , a catalyst comprising a support e.g., silica and a chromium containing compound e.g., chromium oxide deposited on the support a so called Phillips catalyst , or a radical initiator e.g., organic peroxides . In addition, modified polyolefins prepared by graft polymerization of compounds containing at least one double bond e.g., unsaturated carboxylic acids, monobasic carboxylic acids, and vinylsilane compounds to the above olefin polymers can be used. Methods of production of these olefin resins and modified polyolefins are well known. These olefin polymers and modified polyolefins can be used singly or in combination with each other.

In addition, N alkoxymethyl modified nylon type 8 nylon , transparent nylon trimethylhexamethylenediamine terephthalic acid condensates, nylon 9, nylon 13, Q2 nylon, and the like can be used. For these polyamide resins, the molecular weight is usually at least 10,000, preferably from 15,000 to 50,000, and more preferably from 15,000 to 30,000. The degree of polymerization is usually at least 100, preferably from 150 to 500, and more preferably from 150 to 300. These polyamide resins are commercially produced and widely used in a wide variety of applications. Their process of production, characteristics, and so forth are described in detail, for example, in O. Fukumoto, etc., Polycarbonate resins which can be used as the thermoplastic resin II can usually be prepared by the following four methods Of the above described methods, Methods 1 and 3 are industrially employed. Method 1 is called a melting method, in which bisphenol A and diphenyl carbonate are reacted at elevated temperatures and under reduced pressure in an inert gas atmosphere in the absence or presence of an ester exchange catalyst. Ester exchange catalysts which can be used include various metals, metal alcoholates, oxides, carbonic acid salts, acetic acid salts, hydrides, organic acid alkali salts, and alkaline earth metal amides. Method 3 is called a solvent method, in which bisphenol A and phosgene are reacted at room temperature in a solvent in the presence of an acid coupling agent e.g., caustic alkali and pyridine . The molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin as produced by Method 1 is usually from 5,000 to 50,000 and more usually from 10,000 to 30,000. The molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin as produced by Method 3 is usually from 10,000 to 200,000 and more usually from 20,000 to 150,000. These polycarbonate resins are commercially produced and widely used in various applications. Their process of production, characteristics, and so forth are described in detail, for example, in Tachikawa and Sakajiri, ed., Styrene polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention include a styrene homopolymer generally having a molecular weight of from 50,000 to 300,000 , copolymers made mainly at least 60 by weight of styrene i.e., copolymers of at least 60 by weight of styrene and other monomers, i.e., organic compounds containing a double bond , and impact resistant resins as described hereinafter. Typical examples of the above organic compounds containing a double bond are ethylene, vinyl acetate, maleic anhydride, acrylonitrile, and methyl methacrylate. Methods of production of these styrene polymers are well known. Impact resistant resins are produced by graft copolymerization of styrene onto butadiene rubber and styrene butadiene rubber. This styrene butadiene rubber is a copolymer rubber comprising at least 60 by weight of butadiene and styrene. It may be a random copolymer rubber or a block copolymer rubber. For these butadiene rubber and styrene butadiene rubber, the Mooney viscosity is usually from 20 to 140, with the range of from 20 to 120 being particularly preferred. The graft copolymerization method includes a bulk polymerization method, a solution polymerization method, an emulsion polymerization method, and an aqueous suspension polymerization method, and a combination of the above method and a graft polymerization method for example, a method comprising conducting bulk polymerization and then aqueous suspension polymerization . The total amount of the butadiene rubber and the styrene butadiene rubber added to produce 100 parts by weight of the impact resistant resin is from 1 to 30 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 25 parts by weight, and particularly preferably from 2 to 20 parts by weight. In addition, a method may be employed in which a relatively large amount of the above rubber is used to produce a graft polymer containing a large amount of the rubber like material, and the above styrene polymer and or copolymer of styrene and other monomer is added to and mixed with the graft polymer. In this case, the amount of the rubber used is calculated based on the amount of the mixture. The molecular weight of the monomer chain grafted to the rubber is usually from 1,000 to 300,000 and preferably from 2,000 to 250,000. In general, in this graft polymerization, it rarely occurs that the monomer is completely bound to the rubber. That is, a grafted material, rubber, and homopolymers of the monomer which is not linked to the rubber are present in combination. This mixture is used as such without separation of any of the grafted material, rubber and homopolymers of the monomer. These styrene polymers are industrially produced and widely used in various fields. Their methods of production and, properties are well known. The impact resistant resin A which is used as the thermoplastic resin II of the present invention contains from 5 to 40 by weight, preferably from 10 to 40 by weight, more preferably from 15 to 35 by weight, as a total amount of chlorinated polyethylene and a chlorinated polyethylene produced by graft polymerization of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound to chlorinated polyethylene. The impact resistant resin A may further contain a copolymer of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound. The impact resistant resin A of the present invention is a composition prepared by mixing chlorinated polyethylene and the above styrene vinyl compound copolymer, a graft copolymer prepared by graft polymerization of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound to chlorinated polyethylene, or a composition prepared by mixing a graft copolymer obtained by graft copolymerization of small amounts of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound to chlorinated polyethylene and the above styrene vinyl compound copolymer. In a case that,of the impact resistant resins of the present invention, the composition is used, a composition may be used which has been prepared by mixing constituents in advance. Alternatively, they may be mixed in producing the ultimate composition of the present invention. Even if any of the above composition and graft copolymer is used as the impact resistant resin A of the present invention, it is important that the proportion of the non grafted and grafted chlorinated polyethylenes in the ultimate composition is within the above described range. Chlorinated polyethylene to be used in the preparation of the impact resistant resin A can be produced by chlorinating powdered polyethylene or polyethylene particles in an aqueous suspension, or by chlorinating polyethylene dissolved in organic solvents. Chlorinated polyethylene produced by chlorinating polyethylene in an aqueous suspension is desirable. In general, amorphous or crystalline chlorinated polyethylene having a chlorine content of from 20 to 50 by weight is used. Particularly preferred is amorphous chlorinated polyethylene having a chlorine content of from 25 to 45 by weight. The above polyethylene is an ethylene homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene and 10 by weight or less of α olefin usually having 6 or less carbon atoms . In general, the density is from 0.910 to 0.970 g cc, and the molecular weight is from 50,000 to 700,000. Representative examples of the impact resistant resins are a grafted material prepared by graft copolymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile onto chlorinated polyethylene, a grafted material prepared by graft copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate onto chlorinated polyethylene, a blended material of chlorinated polyethylene and a styrene acrylonitrile copolymer, and a blended material of chlorinated polyethylene and an acryl resin. The acryl resin includes polymers made mainly of acrylates or methacrylates. Typical examples are polymers made mainly of methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and or methyl methacrylate. An impact resistant resin B which is used as the thermoplastic resin II of the present invention is prepared by graft copolymerization of at least one vinyl compound selected from the group consisting of styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate onto at least one rubber selected from the group consisting of butadiene rubber, acrylate rubber, and ethylene propylene rubber, as described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 1, pp. 374 444 1964 . The butadiene rubber is a rubber made mainly at least 60 by weight of butadiene, including a butadiene homopolymer rubber and a copolymer rubber of butadiene and a small amount of styrene or acrylonitrile SBR and NBR . The butadiene styrene copolymer rubber may be a block copolymer rubber or a random copolymer rubber.

In these polymers, it is preferred that the weight ratio of the ethylene monomer unit to the propylene monomer unit be from 30 70 to 70 30. The ethylene propylene rubbers are produced by copolymerizing ethylene and propylene, or ethylene, propylene and the above monomer in the presence of a catalyst system comprising transition metal compounds and organoaluminum compounds. In producing the impact resistant resins of the present invention, the rubber like material preferably has a Mooney viscosity of from 20 to 140, with the range of from 30 to 120 being particularly preferred, although it varies depending on the type of the rubber like material. These rubber like materials are produced industrially and used widely in various fields. Their methods of production, properties, and uses are well known see, for example, S. Kanbara, The impact resistant resin B is produced by graft polymerization of at least one of styrene and other vinyl compounds e.g., acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate onto the above rubber like material. The graft polymerization method includes a bulk polymerization method, a solution polymerization method, an emulsion polymerization method, and an aqueous suspension polymerization method, and a combination of the above polymerization method Typical examples of the impact resistant resins B are shown below. An acrylonitrile butadiene styrene terpolymer ABS resin obtained by graft copolymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile onto a butadiene homopolymer rubber, a styrene butadiene block or random copolymer rubber SBR , or an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber NBR a methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene terpolymer resin MBS resin obtained by graft copolymerzation of styrene and methyl methacrylate onto the butadiene homopolymer rubber or SBR an acrylonitrile acrylate styrene terpolymer resin AAS resin obtained by graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile and styrene onto the acrylate rubber and a graft copolymer resin AES resin obtained by graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile and styrene onto the ethylene propylene rubber. The phenylene oxide polymer which is used as the thermoplastic resin II of the present invention is at least one thermoplastic resin selected from the group consisting of phenylene oxide containing condensates and polymers obtained by graft polymerization of vinyl compound styrene or a mixture of styrene and other vinyl compound such as acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate onto phenylene oxide containing condensates. The phenylene oxide polymer composition may further contain polymers obtained by graft polymerization of the vinyl compound onto the above described rubber like materials i.e., butadiene rubbers, acrylate rubbers, ethylene propylene rubbers, and chlorinated polyethylene rubbers , and or the above described styrene containing polymers styrene polymers . The total proportion of the phenylene oxide containing condensate and the grafted phenylene oxide containing condensate in the composition is at least 5.0 by weight, preferably at least 7.0 by weight, and particularly preferably at least 10 by weight. The phenylene oxide containing condensate is polyphenylene ether hereinafter abbreviated to PPO , which can be represented by formula IV The grafted condensate is obtained by graft polymerization of styrene or a mixture of styrene and at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting of styrene containing one or more alkyl groups having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate onto the above described PPO, as described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 10, pp. 92 111 1967 . Methyl methacrylate polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention are thermoplastic resins made mainly from methyl methacrylate. Typical examples of such methyl methacrylate polymers are a methyl methacrylate homopolymer, and copolymers of methyl methacrylate and 30 mol or less of other monomers containing at least one double bond. Monomers which can be used in these copolymers include methacrylates containing an alkyl group or cycloalkyl group having 12 or less carbon atoms e.g., ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and cyclohexane methacrylate , acrylates containing an alkyl group or cycloalkyl group having 12 or less carbon atoms e.g., ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and cyclohexane acrylate , vinyl compounds containing one double bond e.g., styrene and vinyl acetate , and polyfunctional organic compounds containing at least two double bonds e.g., ethylene dimethacrylate, propylene dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene, triallyl cyanurate, and diallyl cyanurate . In the copolymers of the methyl methacrylate polymers of the present invention, the proportion of the vinyl compound polymerized is usually 20 mol or less and preferably 15 mol or less. If the proportion of the vinyl compound polymerized is in excess of 20 mol , the characteristics of the methyl methacrylate polymer are exhibited only insufficiently. The proportion of the polyfunctional organic compound polymerized is generally 10 mol or less and preferably 8 mol or less. If it is in excess of 10 mol , moldability is poor. These methyl methacrylate polymers are produced by polymerizing methyl methacrylate, singly or in combination with vinyl compounds and or polyfunctional organic compounds in the presence of polymerization initiators e.g., organic peroxides according to a bulk polymerization method, a solution polymerization method, an emulsion polymerization method, or a suspension polymerization method, or a combination of these polymerization methods e.g., bulk polymerization followed by suspension polymerization , as described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 1, pp. 246 342 1964 . The average degree of polymerization of the methyl methacrylate polymers of the present invention is usually from 300 to 10,000, preferably from 300 to 7,000, and particularly preferably from 300 to 5,000. If methyl methacrylate polymers having an average degree of polymerization of less than 300 are used, the mechanical strength of the reflector for a circular polarization antenna is poor. On the other hand, if the average degree of polymerization is in excess of 10,000, moldability is poor. Aromatic polyesters which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention are polyesters containing aromatic ring pendants in its repeating unit. They are polymers or copolymers derived by condensation of aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their ester forming derivatives and diols or their ester forming derivatives as main components.

As part of the above diol 50 mol at most , long chain glycols having a molecular weight of from 400 to 6,000, i.e., polyethylene glycol, poly 1,3 propylene glycol, and polytetramethylene glycol can be used. The above aromatic dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids other than the aromatic dicarboxylic acids, diols, and long chain glycols to be used in place of the diols may be used singly or in combination with each other. Preferred examples of the aromatic polyesters that are used in the present invention are polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyhexamethylene terephthalate, polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate, polyethylene 2,6 naphthalate, and polyethylene 1,2 diphenoxyethane 4,4 dicarboxylate. Of these aromatic polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate are preferred. In connection with these aromatic polyesters, their methods of production and mechanical properties are well known, as described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 11, pp. 62 128 1969 . For the aromatic polyesters, the intrinsic viscosity as determined at 30 C in a mixed solvent of phenol and tetrachloroethane 1 1 by weight is usually from 0.4 to 1.5, preferably from 0.4 to 1.3, and particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1.3. If aromatic polyesters having an intrinsic viscosity of less than 0.4 are used, no reflector for a circular polarization antenna having a sufficiently high mechanical strength can be obtained. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 1.5, the resulting mold is deteriorated in surface properties. Oxymethylene polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention are thermoplastic resins made mainly from formaldehyde or trioxane. Typical examples of such oxymethylene polymers are a homopolymer of formaldehyde, a homopolymer of trioxane, and copolymers of formaldehyde and or trioxane and from 0.1 to 15 by weight preferably from 0.1 to 10 by weight of cyclic ethers, cyclic acetals, and or straight chain polyacetal. Typical examples of such cyclic ethers and cyclic acetals are compounds represented by the following formula V Of the cyclic ethers or cyclic acetals represented by the general formula V , those compounds in which R⁵ to R⁸ are alkyl groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms are preferred. Particularly preferred are those compounds in which R⁵ to R⁸ are alkyl groups having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms. They may be substituted by 1 to 3 halogen atoms preferably a chlorine atom . Furthermore, it is preferred that cyclic ethers having from 3 to 5 rings or cyclic acetals having from 5 to 9 rings be used. Comonomers which can be used include epoxide compounds such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1,2 butylene oxide, styrene oxide, epichlorohydrin, and oxetane or its derivatives e.g., 3,3 bischloromethyloxetane and tetrahydrofuran , cyclic formals such as 1,3 dioxacycloheptane and 1,3,6 trioxacycloheptane, and substituted products resulting from substitution of the above compounds with a methyl group, an ethyl group, a chloromethyl group, a trichloromethyl group, or a phenyl group e.g., 4 phenyl 1,3 dioxolan, and 4 methyl 1,3 dioxolan . In addition, derivatives resulting from substitution of the cyclic acetals e.g., the above 1,3 dioxacycloalkane by a methyl group, an ethyl group, a phenyl group, a chloromethyl group, or a vinyl group at the 2 position thereof can be used. Furthermore, linear polyacetals which are decomposed during polymerization and act as comonomers can be used. These linear polyacetals can be produced by polymerization or copolymerization of the above cyclic acetals, and further from dihydric alcohols e.g., ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, propylene glycol, and p xylylenediol and aldehydes in particular, formaldehyde . In producing the oxymethylene polymers, numerous polymerization catalysts can be used. Preferred examples of the polymerization catalysts are those containing boron fluoride, thionyl chloride, fluorosulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphorus trichloride, titanium tetrachloride, ferric chloride, zirconium tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride, stannous chloride, and stannic chloride. Particularly preferred are boron fluoride and boron fluoride containing substances e.g., boron fluoride monohydrate, boron fluoride dihydrate, and boron fluoride trihydrate . In general, the oxymethylene polymers are produced by polymerizing or copolymerizing formaldehyde and or trioxane, or them with the above comonomers in inert organic solvents as described hereinafter at a temperature of from 20 to 115 C desirably from 60 to 100 C in the presence of the above polymerization catalysts. Inert organic solvents which can be used for this purpose include cyclohexane, benzene, pentane, trichloroethylene, ligroin, carbon tetrachloride, octane, di n butyl ether, and petroleum ether. These solvents are used in an amount of 20 by weight or less, preferably from 0.25 to 10 by weight, based on the amount of polymerizable substances, i.e., trioxane, formaldehyde and comonomers. The reduced viscosity of the oxymethylene polymer is generally from 0.2 to 3.0 the reduced viscosity is measured at 140 C using a solution which has been prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of the polymer in 100 mℓ of γ butyrolactone containing 2 of diphenylamine . Particularly preferred is a range of from 0.5 to 3.0. The M.I. is preferably from 0.1 to 50 g 10 min and particularly preferably from 0.5 to 40 g 10 min. The oxymethylene polymers are industrially produced and widely used in various fields. Their methods of production, and mechanical properties are well known see Encyclopedia , Vol. 10, pp. 319 324 1969 . Vinyl chloride polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins II of the present invention are a vinyl chloride homopolymer and copolymers of vinyl chloride and 50 by weight or less preferably 45 by weight or less of compounds copolymerizable with vinyl chloride and containing at least one double bond. The degree of polymerization for these vinyl chloride polymers is usually from 400 to 4,500 and preferably from 400 to 1,500. Typical examples of these compounds containing at least one double bond are vinylidene chloride, ethylene, propylene, vinyl acetate, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and their esters, maleic acid and its esters, and acrylonitrile. These vinyl chloride polymers can be produced by polymerizing vinyl chloride or copolymerizing vinyl chloride and vinyl compounds as described above in the presence of free radical catalysts. Their methods of production are well known and widely used in various fields, as described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 14, pp. 305 483 1971 . In producing the inorganic filler containing vinyl chloride polymers of the present invention, vinyl chloride polymers alone may be used as polymeric substances. In addition, compositions of the vinyl chloride polymers and other polymeric substances compatible therewith may be used. Examples of such polymeric substances are chlorinated polyethylene rubbers the chlorine content is usually from 25 to 45 by weight derived by chlorination of a homopolymer of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene and α olefins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms the proportion of α olefin is usually 20 mol or less , having a molecular weight of from 10,000 to 1,000,000 preferably from 10,000 to 100,000 the above described ethylene propylene diene copolymer rubber EPDM , natural rubber, chloroprene rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, styrene butadiene copolymer rubber SBR , acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber, and butadiene homopolymer rubber, the Mooney viscosity ML₁ ₄ of these rubbers being generally from 10 to 150.

Of the thermoplastic resins II , olefin polymers, polyamide resins, impact resistant resins A , impact resistant resins B , phenylene oxide polymers, polycarbonate resins, and aromatic polyester resins are preferred in that they are excellent in moldability, are well balanced in mechanical properties such as stiffness and creep resistance and, furthermore, are superior in weather resistance. Particularly preferred are olefin polymers and impact resistant resins B . As inorganic fillers to be used in the preparation of the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer, those fillers widely used in the field of synthetic resins and rubbers can be used. They are inorganic compounds that do not react with oxygen and water. Preferably used are those fillers which are not decomposed during the process of kneading or molding. The inorganic fillers can be divided into groups metals such as aluminum, copper, iron, lead, and nickel compounds, such as oxides and their hydrates hydroxides , sulfuric acid salts, carbonic acid salts, and silicic acid salts of the above metals and metals such as magnesium, calcium, barium, zinc, zirconium, molybdenum, silicon, antimony, and titanium complex salts of the above metals and mixtures thereof. Typical examples of these inorganic fillers are the above described metals, aluminum oxide alumina , their hydrates, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide magnesia , magnesium hydroxide, zinc oxide, oxides of lead such as lead oxide red and lead oxide, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, basic magnesium carbonate, white carbon, asbestos, mica, talc, galss fiber, glass powder, glass beads, clay, diatomaceous earth kaolin clay , silica, wollastonite, iron oxide, antimony oxide, titanium oxide titania , lithopone, pumice powder, aluminum sulfate glypsum, for example , zirconium carbonate, zirconium oxide, barium carbonate, dolomite, molybdenum disulfide, and iron sand. In the case of powdered inorganic fillers, it is preferred that the diameter be 1 mm or less with the range of from 0.5 mm or less being more preferred . In the case of fibrous inorganic fillers, it is preferred that the diameter be from 1 to 500 microns with the range of from 1 to 300 microns being more preferred, and the length be from 0.1 to 6 mm with the range of from 0.1 to 5 mm being more preferred . Further, in the case of plate shaped inorganic fillers, it is preferred that the diameter be 2 mm or less with the range of 1 mm or less being more preferred . Of these inorganic fillers, mica, talc, calcium carbonate, glass fiber, wollastonite are desirable in that they increase stiffness. Particularly preferred are talc, mica, and glass fiber. With regard to these inorganic fillers, details are described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 6, pp. 740 763 and Vol. 6, pp. 610 to 690 1976 . When a thermoplastic resin layer is used as a surface layer of the reflector of the present invention, it functions to prevent corrosion of the metallic layer. Thus the thickness of the thermoplastic resin layer is from 5 µm to 5 mm, preferably from 10 µm to 5 mm, and particularly preferably from 10 µm to 1 mm. If the thickness of the thermoplastic resin layer is less than 5 µm, the metallic layer is corroded. Another problem is that the thermoplastic resin layer is worn out by contact with other articles or friction during use, thereby exposing the metallic layer. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 5 mm, not only a reduction in the reflectance of wave, but also an increase in production costs and further in the weight of the ultimate laminated material undesirably occur. When a coating layer is used as a surface layer of the reflector of the present invention, it functions to prevent corrosion of the metallic layer. The thickness of the coating layer is from 5 µm to 1 mm, preferably from 10 µm to 0.5 mm, and particularly preferably from 10 µm to 0.3 mm. If the thickness of the coating layer is less than 5 µm, the corrosion of the metallic layer is caused. Furthermore, the coating layer is worn out by contact with other articles or friction during use, thereby exposing the metallic layer. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 1 mm, the reflectance of wave is reduced. Furthermore, the production costs and the weight of the laminated material are undesirably increased. The metallic layer acts to reflect the wave. The thickness of the metallic layer is from 5 µm to 1 mm, preferably from 5 to 500 µm, and particularly preferably from 10 to 500 µm. If the thickness of the metallic layer is less than 5 µm, wrinkles, for example, are readily formed in the metallic layer during the process of production of the laminated material, causing problems in appearance and performance. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 1 mm, not only the weight is increased, but also the production costs are increased, and problems are encountered in bending the laminated material. The inorganic filler content in the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer is from 10 to 80 by weight i.e., the proportion of the thermoplastic resin II is from 90 to 20 by weight , preferably from 10 to 70 by weight, and particularly preferably from 10 to 60 by weight. If the inorganic filler content is less than 10 by weight, there is an extreme difference in coefficient of linear expansion between the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer and the metallic layer. Thus, there is a possibility that the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer is peeled apart from the metallic layer. Furthermore, a problem arises in that the stiffness of the laminated material is reduced. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 90 by weight, a uniform composition is difficult to produce. Even if such a uniform composition is produced, satisfactory sheets or laminated materials cannot be produced by injection molding, for example. The thickness of the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin layer is from 500 µm to 15 mm, preferably from 1 to 10 mm, and particularly preferably from 1 to 7 mm. If the thickness of the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin layer is less than 500 microns, the stiffness of the layer is low and the layer is undesirably deformed or broken by the external force. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 15 mm, a long period of time is needed for cooling at the time of molding. Furthermore, problems arise in that wrinkles are formed in the surface and the weight is increased. In producing the above described thermoplastic resin I layer and inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer, additives commonly used, such as stabilizers against oxygen, heat and ultraviolet rays, metal deterioration preventing agents, flame retardants, coloring agents, electrical property improving agents, antistatic agents, lubricants, workability improving agents, and tackiness improving agents may be added within the range that they do not deteriorate the characteristics of the thermoplastic resin I and inorganic filler containing resin II layers. In compounding the above additives to the thermoplastic resin I of the present invention and in producing the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II including the case of compounding the above additives to the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II , dry blending using mixers such as a Henschel mixer commonly used in the field may be employed, or melt kneading using a Banbury mixer, a kneader, a roll mill, and a screw type extruder, for example, may be employed. In this case, a uniform composition can be obtained by a procedure in which dry blending is first applied and then the resulting composition mixture is melt kneaded. It is particularly preferred that the thermoplastic resin II be used in the form of powder, since it can be uniformly mixed. In this case, the composition, after being melt kneaded, is generally pelletized and then used in the subsequent molding. In producing the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II , all components may be mixed at the same time, or alternatively part of the components are mixed to prepare a master batch which is then mixed with the other components. When the above composition is prepared by melt kneading, it is necessary that the melt kneading be carried out at temperatures not lower than the melting point or softening point of the thermoplastic resin I or II . If, however, it is carried out at higher temperatures, the thermoplastic resins I and II are deteriorated. In general, therefore, it is carried out in the temperature range 20 C higher preferably more than 50 C higher than the melting point or softening point of the thermoplastic resin I or II but not causing deterioration of the thermoplastic resin I or II . The reflector for a circular polarization antenna of the present invention is explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a partial perspective view of an antenna equipped with a reflector for a circular polarization antenna.

As can be understood from the above drawings, the reflector of the present invention has a structure comprising at least three layers. In order to enhance the adhesion between the thermoplastic resin layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance and the metallic layer, or between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer, primers as described hereinafter can be used. Furthermore, to fit the reflector of the present invention to a support, the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer may be provided with an attaching rib, or to reinforce the reflector, a reinforcing rib may be provided. Moreover, the support for the circular polarization antenna may be bored and fitted by the use of bolts and nuts, for example. The diameter of the reflector of the present invention is usually from 60 to 120 cm.

In Figure 7, 1c is an inorganic filler free thermoplastic resin II layer and 1d is a thermoplastic resin II layer containing an inorganic filler. A metallic foil previously laminated is produced, and this laminated metallic foil is molded into a desired form by techniques such as vacuum molding, stamping molding, and injection molding. A process for the production of the laminated metallic foil by these molding methods is described below in detail. Lamination of a thermoplastic resin I on the above metallic foil metallic layer can be carried out by commonly used techniques. These techniques are described below in detail. A thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance can be laminated on or bonded to the metallic layer by a dry lamination method. When thermoplastic resins I capable of being extruded at high temperatures are used, the thermoplastic resin I layer can be laminated on the metallic layer by an extrusion lamination method. In producing the laminated metallic foil by the extrusion lamination method, it is sufficient that the thermoplastic resin I is extruded by the use of a T die film molding machine in the temperature range of from 240 to 370 C so that the thickness is within the above defined range while at the same time the extruded layer is laminated on the metallic foil metallic layer by the use of cooling press rolls. When thermoplastic resins I or paints having superior adhesion to the metallic foil are used, the laminated metallic foil can be produced by the above described procedure. On the other hand, in the case of thermoplastic resins or paints exhibiting no satisfactory adhesion to the metallic foil, primers anchor coating agents as described hereinafter that are commonly used in the field of the thermoplastic resins I are coated on one side of the metallic foil by a gravure coating method or a reverse coating method and then dried at 50 to 100 C. Thereafter, a thermoplastic resin film or sheet is press bonded to the primer layer by the use of a press roll maintained at 50 to 100 C. In accordance with this method, a primer is coated on one surface of the metallic layer with a thermoplastic resin I layer laminated on the other surface, and then an inorganic filler containint thermoplastic II resin is extruded in the form of a sheet by a T die molding method, whereupon there can be obtained a laminated material comprising a thermoplastic resin I layer having superior weather resistance, a metallic layer, and an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer. The thus produced laminated material sheet is fixed by means of iron frames or snail shaped devices, fitted to a jig that makes easy handling, and then introduced into an apparatus where it is heated by means of ceramic heaters or wire heaters arranged at upper and lower positions. The sheet starts to melt on heating. On continuing the heating after sagging of the sheet once occurred, the sheet is stretched in the frame. At this point when the above phenomenon is observed, the sheet is in good condition for molding of the sheet, so that no wrinkles or unevenness in thickness is formed. At this point, the sheet frame is taken out of the heating apparatus, placed on the top portion of a mold, and vacuum molded under a reduced pressure of 1 atmospheric pressure, whereupon the desired mold can be obtained. Thereafter, it is cooled with air or sprayed water and taken out of the mold. In accordance with pressure molding, a sheet which has become easy to handle is placed on a mold, a chamber for applying pressure is placed on the sheet, and then the sheet is pressed toward the mold under a pressure of from 3 to 5 atmospheric pressure while at the same time the mold is pushed upward. In producing a reflector for a circular polarization antenna of the present invention, a laminated material comprising a thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance, a metallic layer, and an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer as produced by the above described vacuum molding method is placed in a squeezing mold fitted to a vertical press machine and then heat molded under a pressure of from 5 to 50 kg cm² preferably from 10 to 20 kg cm² whereupon the desired mold can be obtained. The mold is then cooled with air or sprayed water and then taken out of the mold. In this molding, the press time is usually at least 15 seconds, and generally from 15 to 40 seconds. In order to improve surface characteristics, it is preferred that the molding be performed under two stage pressure conditions. At the first stage, the laminated material is pressed under a pressure of from 10 to 20 kg cm² for from 15 to 40 seconds and at the second stage it is pressed under a pressure of from 40 to 50 kg cm² for at least 5 seconds, whereupon there can be obtained a mold having superior surface smoothness. Particularly, when an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer having poor fluidity is used, it is desirable to employ the above two stage molding method. In producing the reflector of the present invention by the injection molding method, a metallic layer with a thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance laminated on one side and with a primer layer coated on the other side is subjected to insert injection molding at the time of molding the reflector. In the practice of the insert injection molding, the above metallic layer is placed between a male mold and a female mold in such a manner that the thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance is in contact with the male mold and then the mold is closed. Thereafter, an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II is introduced into the mold and cooled, and then the mold is opened, whereupon the desired reflector is obtained. In the insert injection molding, the resin temperature is higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin II but lower than the decomposition temperature thereof. If the injection pressure is such that the gauge pressure in the nozzle portion of the cylinder of the injection molding machine is at least 40 kg cm², molding in a form nearly equivalent with the shape of the mold can be attained. Furthermore, there can be obtained an article having good appearance. The injection pressure is usually from 40 to 140 kg cm² and preferably from 70 to 120 kg cm². Various methods can be employed in producing the reflector of the present invention using a paint coating layer as a surface layer. In accordance with a typical example of the methods, a primer or anchor coating agent as described hereinafter is coated on one surface of a metallic layer and then dried to form a coating layer, and the metallic layer with the above coating layer is laminated on an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer with or without application of primers. After the lamination of the metallic layer on the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer, the paint may be coated on the top surface of the metallic layer. The reflector of the present invention can be produced by laminating an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer on a metallic layer with a coating layer provided thereon, or laminating an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer on a metallic layer and, thereafter, applying coating as described hereinafter. In either case, if the adhesion between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer is satisfactorily high, it is not necessary to coat a primer on the metallic layer. A metallic layer and an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer may be first laminated with or without a primer by the extrusion lamination method to produce a laminated material which is then molded by the vacuum molding method, pressure molding method, or stamping molding method. In addition, the reflector of the present invention may be produced using a metallic layer with a coating layer according to the insert injection molding method. Furthermore, the reflector may be produced by laminating an inorganic filler containint thermoplastic resin II layer and a metallic layer having or not having a coating layer and with or without application of a primer between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer and, thereafter, bonding them together under pressure while heating. In producing the reflector of the present invention, a procedure may be employed in which a mold for production of the reflector, comprising a metallic layer not having a coating layer and further not coated with a primer and an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer is first produced and, thereafter, a coating layer is provided with or without application of a primer. The above described vacuum molding method, pressure molding method, stamping molding method, and insert injection molding method are all well known in the art commonly used techniques can be applied. A method of coating a paint on the metallic layer of the mold, which has been produced by the vacuum molding method, the pressure molding method, the stamping molding method, or the injection molding method and has not been coated with a paint, is not critical in the present invention. For example, a method of spraying the paint by the use of a spray gun with or without previous coating of a primer, a method of coating with a brush, and a method of coating by the use of a roll coater can be employed. Industrially, the method of using a spray gun is effective. In particular, a method of coating by the use of a robot is preferably used. In the above vacuum molding method, pressure molding method and stamping molding method, a primer layer is not placed between the coating layer and the metallic layer. When, however, the adhesion between the paint and the metallic layer is not sufficiently satisfactory, a primer layer may be sandwiched therebetween. This primer can be applied by commonly used procedures. Usually the primer is coated on one surface of the metallic foil by a gravure coating method or a bar coating method, for example, and then dried at 50 to 100 C. In cases that as thermoplastic resins II for the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer in the production of the reflector of the present invention, olefin polymers as described above are used, blowing agents as described hereinafter may be added to the inorganic filler containing olefin polymers so that there may be formed an expanded inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer comprising a skin layer and a core layer, said skin layer being a substantially unexpanded layer and said core layer being an expanded layer. The thickness of the skin layer is usually from 5 to 45 of the total thickness of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer. If the thickness of the skin layer is less than 5 of the total thickness of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer, expansion traces silver streaks are formed in the surface and the appearance is not good. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 45 , sink mark minute concave is formed in the rib portion and the thick portion of the back surface. As blowing agents to be added to the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer constituting the core layer, any blowing agents commonly used in the art can be used. Inorganic or organic physical or chemical blowing agents can be used. Physical blowing agents are at least in a gaseous form at molding temperatures as described hereinafter and do not exert adverse influences on inorganic fillers compounded. Typical examples of such blowing agents are organic compounds such as hydrocarbons e.g., pentane, butane, and propane , halogenated hydrocarbons, and alcohols, and inorganic elements or compounds such as nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide gas. Chemical blowing agents are those compounds which are not decomposed at ordinary temperature but are decomposed at molding temperatures as described hereinafter, thereby generating gases such as carbon dioxide gas, nitrogen gas and ammonia. Furthermore, they do not exert adverse influences on both the olefin polymers and inorganic fillers compounded. Typical examples of such blowing agents includes sodium hydrogencarbonate, ammonium hydrogencarbonate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium nitrite, and azide compounds, azo compounds e.g., azodicarbonamide and barium azodicarboxylate , and sulfonyl hydrazide compounds. Of these blowing agents, those compounds generating carbon dioxide gas and nitrogen are desirable. Blowing agents not generating carbon dioxide gas or nitrogen at the time of kneading less than 150 C but producing it at the time of molding less than 300 C are suitable. These blowing agents are described in Encyclopedia , Vol. 2, pp. 532 565. These blowing agents may be used singly or in combination with each other. In addition, blowing promotors may be added. The amount of the blowing promotor added varies depending on the thickness of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer, the thickness of the rib or thick portion of the reflector, and the height of the rib or thick portion. In general, it is appropriate to be from 0.1 to 20 by weight based on the weight of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer. The average degree of expansion of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer is usually from 1.005 to 1.50, preferably from 1.005 to 1.45, and particularly preferably from 1.01 to 1.40. If the average degree of expansion of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer is less than 1.005, sink mark is formed in the surface of the ultimate mold. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 1.50, expansion traces are present in the skin layer fo the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer and the appearance is not satisfactory. In producing the reflector of the present invention in accordance with this method, a metallic foil as laminated as described above according to this method, the laminated metallic foil is molded by the above described injection molding method, whereupon there can be obtained an article reflector for a circular polarization antenna comprising a core layer expanded layer and a skin layer smooth unexpanded layer and having a satisfactory appearance. In order that a layer made of this inorganic filler containing olefin polymer a composition of an olefin polymer and an inorganic filler constitutes a skin layer and a core layer, a master batch containing a blowing agent may be blended with the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer and then injection molded, or alternatively a procedure may be used in which two injection molding machines are used an inorganic filler containing olefin polymer not containing a blowing agent is first injected into a mold and, thereafter, prior to solidification of the central portion of the injected inorganic filler containing olefin polymer, an inorganic filler containing olefin polymer containing a blowing agent is injected into the central portion of the above injected inorganic filler containing olefin polymer through a nozzle of the other injection molding machine, whereupon a skin layer made of the first injected inorganic filler containing olefin polymer and a core layer expanded layer made of the secondly injected inorganic filler containing olefin polymer with the blowing agent compounded thereto can be formed. In practice of the insert injection molding, the above described metallic layer is placed between the molds of the injection molding machine in such a manner that the thermoplastic resin I layer having superior weather resistance is in contact with the male mold and then the mold is closed. An inorganic filler containing olefin polymer is injected into the mold through a gate of the mold and cooled and, thereafter, the mold is opened, whereupon the desired reflector can be produced. In this case, the injection molding temperature is higher than the melting point of the olefin polymer of the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer, and higher than the decomposition temperature in the case of chemical blowing agents or gasification temperature in the case of physical blowing agents. When, as the olefin polymer, a propylene polymer is used, it is preferred that the insert injection molding be conducted in the temperature range of from 170 to 290 C. On the other hand, when, as the olefin polymer, an ethylene polymer is used, the insert injection molding is carried out in the temperature range of from 120 to 250 C. If any one or both of the thermoplastic resin I and the thermoplastic resin II are olefin polymers, the adhesiveness between the metallic layer and the olefin polymer layer can be increased by placing a modified olefin polymer layer as described hereinafter between the metallic layer metallic foil and the olefin polymer layer or the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer, or between the metallic layer and the olefin polymer layer and also between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer. Such modified olefin polymers are prepared by modifying the above described olefin polymers with unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their anhydrides as described below. Typical examples of these unsaturated carboxylic acids and their anhydrides to be used in the preparation of the modified olefin polymer layer are monobasic carboxylic acids having 10 or less carbon atoms and containing at least one double bond e.g., acrylic acid and methacrylic acid , dibasic carboxylic acids having 15 or less carbon atoms and containing at least one double bond e.g., maleic acid , and anhydrides of the above dibasic carboxylic acids e.g., maleic anhydride and hymic anhydride . Of these unsaturated carboxylic acids and their anhydrides, maleic acid and maleic anhydride are particularly preferred. The modified olefin polymers are prepared by reacting olefin polymers with unsaturated carboxylic acid and or their anhydrides in the presence of organic peroxides. Any of the known methods e.g., a solution process, a suspension process, and a melt process can be used in production of the modified olefin polymers. When the olefin polymers are modified with unsaturated carboxylic acids or thier anhydrides according to the solution process, the olefin polymers and unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their anhydrides are placed in an organic non polar solvent and heated with a radical initiator at high temperatures, whereupon the desired modified olefin polymers can be obtained. In this case, as organic solvents, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, and tetrachloroethane can be used. As radical initiators, organic peroxides such as 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexane, 2,5 dimethyl 5,5 di tert butylperoxy hexene 3 and benzoyl peroxide can be used. The reaction temperature is from 110 to 160 C and preferably from 130 to 150 C. In modifying the olefin polymers with unsaturated carboxylic acids or their anhydrides according to the suspension process, the olefin polymers and unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their anhydrides are placed in a polar solvent generally water and further the above described radical initiator is added, and the resulting mixture is treated under elevated pressure at a temperature of more than 100 C. In modifying the olefin polymers with unsaturated carboxylic acids or their anhydrides according to the melt process, a melt kneader e.g., an extruder commonly used in the field of synthetic resins is used, and the olefin polymers, unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their anhydrides, and radical initiators are melt kneaded in the melt kneader. In this case, the kneading temperature varies with the type of the olefin polymer and the radical initiator usually it is in the range of from the melting point of the olefin polymer to less then 300 C. In the case of ethylene polymers, the kneading temperature is generally from 120 to 270 C, and in the case of propylene polymers, it is generally from 160 to 270 C. The amount of the unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative in the modified olefin polymer is from 0.01 to 10 by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 5.0 by weight, and especially preferably from 0.1 to 5.0 by weight, based on the total weight of the modified olefin polymer. If the unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride content of the modified olefin polymer is less than 0.01 by weight, a cross linking reaction does not almost occur and, therefore, the adhesion between the olefin polymer layer and the metallic layer, and also between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer is not satisfactory. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 10 by weight, the cross linked product modified olefin polymer layer has seriously reduced moldability. The thickness of the modified olefin polymer layer is from 10 to 500 microns, preferably from 10 to 400 microns, and especially preferably from 10 to 300 microns. If the thickness of the modified olefin polymer layer is less than 10 microns, no uniform adhesion can be obtained. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 500 microns, a method of lamination as described hereinafter is difficult to conduct in the production of the reflector of the present invention and furthermore it leads to an increase in product costs. Various procedures can be employed to produce the reflector of the present invention using the above produced modified olefin polymers. In Figure 6, 1 indicates an inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer, and 2 indicates a metallic layer metallic foil . 3 indicates an olefin polymer layer having superior weather resistance. In addition, 2a and 2b indicate modified olefin polymer layers. In the reflector of the present invention, modified olefin polymers are used between the olefin polymer layer and the metallic layer and or between the metallic layer and the inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer in order to increase the adhesion between the layers. As can be seen from Figure 6, the reflector of the present invention comprises an olefin polymer layer 3 , a modified olefin polymer layer 2a , a metallic layer 2, a modified olefin polymer layer 2b , and an inorganic filler containing olefin polymer layer 1 , which are laminated in this order. This laminate can be produced by various methods. The layers may be laminated one by one, or may be laminated at the same time. Another method which may be employed is that two to four layers are laminated in advance and then the other layers are laminated successively. Still another method is that two to four layers are laminated in advance and then a laminate of two or three of the other layers is laminated thereon. A further method which may be employed is that a laminate of two layers and a laminate of two layers are laminated, and then the other layer is laminated on the above produced laminate. A still further method is that one layer is laminated on a laminate of two layers, and then a laminate of the other two layers is laminated thereon. Methods of lamination which can be employed in the production of this type of reflector of the present invention include a dry lamination method and an extrusion lamination method. The dry lamination method is a method in which laminate constituents or a laminate which has been previously produced is laminated under pressure by the use of press rolls maintained at from 50 to 200 C. In the extrusion lamination method, an olefin polymer containing an ultraviolet absorber, a modified olefin polymer, or an inorganic filler containing olefin polymer is shaped into Layer 1 , 2a , 2b or 3 , respectively, at a temperature of from 180 to 300 C by the use of a T die molding machine while at the same time the layers are bonded together by heating in the same manner as above to produce a laminate. The thus produced laminate is molded by the vacuum molding method, the stamping molding method, or the injection molding method, for example, which are generally used, whereupon the reflector of the present invention can be obtained. This is a special method for injection molding of the above laminated metallic foil in the production of the reflector of the present invention. A metallic foil with a thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance laminated on one side thereof and a thermoplastic resin II layer Layer 1c in Figure 7 laminated on the other side is produced in the same manner as described above. This laminated metallic foil is mounted on a mold in such a manner that the thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance is on the moving side of the injection molding mold and the thermoplastic resin II layer is on the fixed side, and the mold is closed. Then, a thermoplastic resin II containing an inorganic filler, which is of the same type as the thermoplastic resin II used in Layer 1c or has good compatibility with the thermoplastic resin II , is injection molded in the same manner as described above. A partially enlarged cross sectional view of the resulting reflector is shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7, 3 denotes the thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance, and 2 denotes a metallic layer metallic foil . 1c denotes an inorganic filler free thermoplastic resin II layer, and 1d denotes a thermoplastic resin II layer containing an inorganic filler. Further, 2a and 2b denote primer layers if any one or both of the primer layers are not used, 2a and or 2b are not present . In the thus produced reflector, the thermoplastic resin II layer laminated on the metallic foil partially mixes with the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer and, therefore, there is no clear interface between the layers. The thus produced reflector has, as well as the above described effects, the following effects. The molding temperature in the above vacuum molding method, pressure molding method, stamping molding method, and injection molding method varies with the type of the thermoplastic resin II . Preferred molding temperatures for several thermoplastic resins II are shown in the table below. Primers commonly used in various fields can be used, although they vary depending on the type of the thermoplastic resin I or paint to be used to form the thermoplastic resin I layer or coating layer having superior weather resistance, and the type of the thermoplastic resin II to be used to form the inorganic filler containing thermoplastic resin II layer. They can be divided into two groups water type and solvent type. They include vinyl , acryl , polyamide , epoxy , rubber , urethane and titanium based primers. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following examples. The testing methods employed in the examples are first described below. The wave reflectance was measured as a reflection coefficient of microwave calculated from a voltage stationary wave ratio which was determined using a square waveguide and in the condition that the top end of the waveguide was shorted. The weather resistance was measured by the use of a sunshine carbon weather meter. After exposure for 2,000 hours under the conditions of black panel temperature 83 C and due cycle 12 min irradiation for 60 minutes , the surface was examined in respect of changes such as discoloration and fading, luster, crazing blister, separation of the metallic foil, and cracks. In the heat cycle test, a test specimen was kept at 80 C for 2 hours, gradually cooled to 45 C over 4 hours, maintained at this temperature for 2 hours, and then gradually heated to 80 C over 4 hours. This cycle was repeated 100 times. The surface of the test specimen was examined in the same manner as in the above weather resistance test. The peeling strength was measured as follows A 15 mm wide test specimen was cut off from the reflector, and the metallic layer of the test specimen was peeled apart at 180 C at a speed of 50 mm min according to ASTM D 903. The peeling strength was evaluated as a stregnth at which the metallic layer was separated from the test specimen. The flexural stiffness was measured according to ASTM D 790. The coefficient of thermal expansion was measured according to ASTM D 696.

At this temperature, polymerization was performed with stirring for 10 hours. To the thus prepared polymer grafted product containing latex like material was added a 5 aqueous solution of aluminum sulfate to coagulate the grafted product. The coagulated product was washed with about 5,200 mℓ of an about 1 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and further, with a large amount about 30 liters of hot water maintained at 70 C.

The Vicat softening point of the grafted product was 97.2 C. The rubber like material content of the grafted product hereinafter referred to as MBS was 9.6 by weight. A 20 liter autoclave made of stainless steel was charged with about 8,000 mℓ of distilled water, 24.0 g of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 0.80 g of ammonium persulfate as a polymerization catalyst, and as monomers, 784 g of butyl acrylate and 16.0 g of glycidyl methacrylate.
