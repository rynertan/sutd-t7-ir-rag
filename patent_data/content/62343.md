## Description
SMALL PARTICLE SIZE LATEX USEFUL AS A PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVE The instant invention relates to latexes useful in sealing and adhesive applications, and particularly to latexes useful as pressure sensitive adhesives. Pressure sensitive adhesives PSAs are adhesive materials which, when dried, possess a lasting aggressive tack which enables them to tenaciously adhere to a wide variety of substrates when applied with only light pressure. These adhesives are useful in a variety of applications including tapes, labels, wall coverings, floor tiles, wood veneers and hobby adhesives. PSAs have traditionally been manufactured in solvent based systems. Recently, however, concerns over the cost of solvents, the flammability of solvents, regulations on solvent emissions and the energy required to keep the work place atmosphere solvent free, have made nonsolvent systems very desirable. While a few attempts have been made to produce a water basedPSA, such attempts have generally failed to produce an acceptable material. Specifically, most attempts are able to produce an adhesive having either good peel adhesion or good shear adhesion, but not an adhesive having both properties. Briefly, the invention is a polymer latex, suitable for use in a pressure sensitive adhesive, having a soft monomer, a hard monomer, an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and a number average particle size of less than about 120 nanometers nm .The invention also is a blend of the latex of the invention, and a tackifying amount of a tackifying resin. More specifically, it is a pressure sensitive adhesive formulation comprising a blend of A 10 to 99 parts by weight on a solids basis of an aqueous synthetic polymer latex comprising disperse polymer particles having a number average diameter of less than about 120 nm, as measured by hydrodynamic chromatography calibrated by electron microscopy, and which individually comprise 1 a soft monomer in an amount to impart stickiness to the latex, 2 a hard monomer in an amount to impart strength to the latex, and 3 an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and B 1 to 90 parts by weight on a solids basis of a tackifying resin. The invention further is an article carrying a dried coating of the latexes or blends of the invention.The latexes and blends of the invention exhibit a combination of both good peel adhesion and good shear adhesion. The latexes of the instant invention employ, as major ingredients, a soft monomer and a hard monomer.These latexes also employ, as a minor ingredient, an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. The proportion of the monomers is adjusted such that the resulting latex has an optimum combination of peel adhesion and shear adhesion. Specifically, the soft monomer is added in an amount such that the latex has soft, sticky and rubbery properties and the hard monomer is added in an amount such that the latex has hard, plastic and strength properties. The acid is added in an amount such that the latex has colloidal stability and processability.Generally, the latexes are prepared from a desirably 30 to 70, preferably 45 to 65, and most preferably 50 to 55, parts. by weight of a soft monomer b desirably 30 to 70, preferably 35 to 55, and most preferably 45 to 50, parts by weight of a hard monomer and c desirably 0.05 to 10, preferably 1 to 5, and most preferably 1 to 4, parts by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. It is also necessary to control the molar mass molecular weight of the latex polymers. This is most easily accomplished by including in the synthesis of the latex, a chain transfer agent. The molar mass of the polymers should be such that the polymer particles show an optimum combination of peel adhesion and shear adhesion. If a chain transfer agent is used to control molar mass, it is desirable that the chain transfer agent have a chain transfer constant similar to that of n octyl mercaptan or t dodecyl mercaptan. Such a chain transfer agent is is desirably present in quantities of 0.5 to 5, preferably 1 to 5 and most preferably 2 to 4, weight percent, based on the total monomer weight. While less efficient chain transfer agents may be used, the quantity added will have to be adjusted in accordance with its chain transfer constant. Such calculations are easily made by those skilled in the art. The term soft monomer is meant to include those addition polymerizable monomers which, if homopolymerized, would have a relatively low glass transition temperature Tg . The Tg for this class of monomers is desirably less than about 250C. More desirably, the term soft monomer is meant to include a class of monomers which are open chain aliphatic conjugated diene monomers having a Tg of less than about 250C. The term open chain aliphatic conjugated diene is meant to include, typically, those compounds containing from 4 to 9 carbon atoms such as, for example, 1, 3 butadiene 2 methyl 1,3 butadiene 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene pentadiene 2 neopentyl 1,3 butadiene and other hydrocarbon analogs of 1,3 butadiene and, in addition, the substituted 1,3 butadienes, such as 2 chloro 1,3 butadiene 2 cyano 1,3 butadiene, the substituted straight chain conjugated pentadienes, the straight chain and branched chain conjugated hexadienes, other straight and branched chain conjugated dienes having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, and comonomeric mixtures thereof.The 1,3 butadiene hydrocarbon monomers such as those mentioned hereinbefore provide interpolymers having particularly desirable properties and are therefore preferred. The cost, ready availability and the excellent properties of interpolymers produced therefrom makes 1,3 butadiene the most preferred open chain aliphatic conjugated diene. The term hard monomer is meant to include those addition pblymerizable monomers which are not carboxylic acids, and if homopolymerized, would have a relatively high Tg The Tg for this class of compounds is desirably greater than about 250C. More desirably, the term hard monomer is meant to include a class of monomers which are monovinylaromatic monomers having a Tg of greater than about 25 C. The term monovinylaromatic monomer is intended to include those monomers wherein a radical of the formula EMI5.1 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl such as an alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is attached directly to an aromatic nucleus containing from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, including those wherein the aromatic nucleus is substituted with alkyl or halogen substituents. Typical of these monomers are styrene, a methylstyrene, ortho, meta and para methylstyrene ortho , meta and para ethylstyrene o,p dimethylstyrene o,p diethylstyrene isopropylstyrene o methyl p isopropylstyrene p chlorostyrene p bromostyrene o,p dichloro styrene o,p dibromostyrene vinylnaphthalene diverse vinyl alkylnaphthalenes and vinyl halonaphthalenes and comonomeric mixtures thereof. Because of considerations such as cost, availability, ease of use, etc., styrene and vinyltoluene are preferred and styrene is especially preferred as the monovinylaromatic monomer. The aforementioned ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers suitably employed in the practice of the invention can vary so long as such acids are copolymerizable with the other monomers of the monomer charge employed. Examples of such suitable acids include itaconic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, vinyl benzoic acid and isopropenyl benzoic acid and preferred species thereof include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid. Naturally, comonomeric mixtures of the indicated monoethylenically unsaturated acids can be employed if desired.Moreover, such acids can be introduced to the polymerization as such or they can be formed in situ in an aqueous polymerization medium by introducing a hydrolyzable derivative of such acid e.g., salts such as sodium acrylate or the anhydride such as maleic anhydride of the desired acid into such aqueous medium. The latexes may be polymerized by any of several methods well known to those skilled in the art.Such methods include the use of a batch reaction, continuous reaction, or continuous addition batch reaction, the latter being preferred. While not critical, the latex is preferably synthesized to an end product having 40 to 60 percent solids. The particle size of the latex is very important for an optimum combination of adhesion and shear strength. The number average particle size diameter of the latex particles is desirably less than 120 nm, preferably less than 110 nm, and most preferably less than 100 nm, as measured by hydrodynamic chromatography HDC calibrated with electron microscopy. As particle size increases, peel adhesion will increase slightly, but shear adhesion will decrease dramatically. It has been observed that when very small particles 76 nm and less, as measured by HDC calibrated with electron microscopy are made, end performance of the adhesive formulations is somewhat reduced. This is believed to be the result of increased cross linking in smaller particles and or a core shell structure effect, both of which may be overcome through adjustments in the polymerization conditions. Particle size of the latexes may be controlled by a variety of techniques including careful measurement and use of surfactant, and the use of a seed latex. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. Particle size control of emulsion polymerized particles is explained, for example, inMeyers Long, Treatise on Coatings and Film FormingCompositions, Volume I, Part 2 1968 See Chapter byF. A. Miller Elias, Macromolecules, Volume 2 1977 pp. 733 736 Blachley, Emulsion Polymerization, 1975 Chapter 7. After the latex is prepared, it is desirably steam distilled to remove unreacted monomer and then treated with a suitable base, desirably NH4OH, to a pH of about 7 to 8. To render the latex commercially useful as aPSA in normal application it is desirably blended with a tackifier. Tackifiers increase the tackiness of adhesives. In many cases they also increase the affinity of adhesives for specific surfaces such as plastics or metals. Tackifiers are generally organic resins and are preferably in the form of an aqueous dispersion. Typical examples of tackifiers include polyterpene resins, gum rosin, rosin esters and other rosin derivatives, oil soluble phenolic resins, coumarone indene resins, and petroleum hydrocarbon resins. Tackifiers are added in an amount such that the latex is given additional tack quick stick and peel adhesion without detracting unduly from shear adhesion. Suitable formulations will typically have 1 to 90 percent, preferably 20 to 60 percent, and most preferably 30 to 50 percent by weight, tackifier. Optionally, certain other ingredients may be added to the PSA latex of the invention. Plasticizers such as mineral oil, liquid polybutenes, liquid polyacrylates, and lanolin may be added. Fillers such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, aluminum hydrate, calcium carbonate, clay, and pigments are commonly employed.Antioxidants such as rubber antioxidants, metal dithiocarbamates, and metal chelating agents may be useful in some applications. The PSA formulated latex tackifier is illustratively used by applying it to a substrate and drying.The formulation may be applied by a variety of well known means including drawing, spraying, and brushing.Drying may take place at room temperature for an extended period of time for example, 2 to 24 hours, depending upon application rate and relative humidity or at an elevated temperature for a short period of time for example, 2500F 1210C for two minutes . After drying, the formulation is usable as aPSA. If not intended to be used immediately, the exposed surface may be protected with a paper having a suitable release coating. Further aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following examples. In the examples, all parts are by weight. Units in brackets, are SI units Newtons N calculated from original measurements in English U.S. units. Peel adhesion and quick stick were evaluated on stainless steel with a Scott X 5 tester available from Henry L. Scott Co. at a rate of 10 inches minute 254 mm minute according to PressureSensitive Tape Counsel PSTC procedures num 1 and num 5, respectively. The peel adhesion test involves peeling the tape off at a 1800 angle after application under relatively heavy pressure. The stick test involves peeling the tape off at a 900 angle after application under relatively light pressure. Both tests are reported as the force required to remove the tape.Shear adhesion is measured according to PSTC num 7 using a 1000 g mass and 1200F 48.90C . In this test, a shear force 20 angle is applied in an oven. The results are reported as the time required for the bond to fail.
