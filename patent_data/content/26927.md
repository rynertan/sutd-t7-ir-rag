# Process for dehydrogenation of 3 beta hydroxy steroids.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the dehydrogenation of 3 β hydroxy steroids, such as a mixture of soy sterols, to form the corresponding Δ⁴ 3 keto derivatives of the steroids. An activated non pyrophoric nickel catalyst is used for the reaction and a diary ketone is used in the reaction as a hydrogen acceptor.
