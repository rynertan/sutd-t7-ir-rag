# Universal joint.

## Abstract
A universal joint for connecting a pair of elongated members provides for transmission of torque between the pair of members 10,12 when the pair of members are oriented at various angles relative to each other. One of the members 10 termin ates in a cavity, which is substan tially cylindrical. The other member 12 extends into the cavity and a pair of sockets 24, 26 cooperate with the other member 12 to secure the latter within the cavity. The pair of sockets 24, 26 include projections 34 which are received in a receptacle 15 on the other member 12 . At least one of the sockets 24, 26 is shiftable in a direction along the major axis of the member 12 receiving the pro jections 34 in order to reduce the maximum dimension of the pair of sockets 24, 26 and the member 12 to permit the pair of sockets 24, 26 and the member 12 to be accommodated within the housing. When accommodated within the housing, the socket is shiftable into its operative position wherein both sockets 24, 26 substantially engage the wall of the cavity. The shiftable socket includes a lock ing member opening 50 designed to accommodate a lock ing member 60 for locking the socket 24, 26 with respect to the other member 12 when the socket is in its operative position with respect to the other member.
