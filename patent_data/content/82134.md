# Toner transfer facilitating apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic brush developer has an elongated toner dispenser 40 with an elongated top opening closed by an elongated slidable cover in the form of a band 29 of flexible material. The band has a toner refill aperture and a container mounting mechanism 46 by which a removable toner container may be attached thereto. The band has coiled spring portions 35, 36 disposed at opposite ends of the top opening, so that the toner content of an attached container can be evenly distributed along the length of the dispenser, this length corresponding to the length of the development zone.
