# Dressing.

## Abstract
A dressing suitable for application to lesions of the skin comprises a conformable apertured film. The film consists of two layers laminated together, the first layer which is the lesion contacting layer is formed from a material which swells in con tact with water. The second layer does not swell or swells less than the first layer when in contact with water. When the first layer is placed in contact with a wet lesion the different swell characteristics causes the apertures to open allowing water to pass through the film from the wet surface to the top of the sec ond layer. On a dry surface the apertures are closed. Preferably the apertures are in the form of slits. A composite dressing in which an absorbent for the fluid passing through the film is in contact with the second layer is also described.
