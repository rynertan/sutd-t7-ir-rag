# A SPACE ENCLOSING STRUCTURE AND DOME LIKE PORTION OF A SPACE ENCLOSING STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A space enclosing structure, the underlying shape of which is a portion of a polyhedron comprised of a regular arrangement of regular pentagons, equilateral triangles, right angled parallelograms and rhombi. The structure permits the use of square or rectangular standardized prefabricated square or rectangular building units such as doors, windows, solar panels, etc., without any alteration of the basic shape of the structure, as such prefabricated units may be used to replace any of the square or rectangular faces of the polyhed ron. Each face 10 other than a right angled parallelogram is abutted on each side by a right angled parallelogram. Each right angled parallelogram is abutted on two opposite sides by rhombi and on the other two sides by a pentagon and a triangle save at the pherferal edge 18,20 of the structure.
