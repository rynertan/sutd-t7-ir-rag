# Encoder capable of removing interaction between adjacent frames.

## Abstract
In an encoder for encoding an input signal AA into a sequence of excitation pulses GG with reference to an au tocorrelation signal DD and a cross correlation signal CC derived from the input signal, a cross correlation controller 40 controls the cross correlation signal in response to the autocorrelation signal and the excitation pulse sequence by producing a control signal HH . Both of the cross correlation and the autocorrelation signals are concerned with a current frame of the input signal and a part of the following frame. The control signal appears in the following frame to be sub tracted from the cross correlation signal in a subtractor 31 and to modify the cross correlation signal into an adjusted cross correlation signal EE . Although the adjusted cross correlation signal lasts for the current frame and the part of the following frame, an excitation pulse generator 32 pro duces the excitation pulses only within the current frame.
