# Method and device for electrolytically applying a metal coating selectively on metal objects.

## Abstract
A method of electrolytically applying a metal coating to metal objects with the aid of an electrolyte which is brought into contact with at least the areas of the metal objects to be covered with metal, the metal objects being guided along the outer circumference of a curved surface whereby the electrolyte is guided in the form of a thin curtain at least substantially tangentially to the areas to be covered with metal of the objects adhering in an elongate tape so that after having passed along the areas to be coated, the elec trolyte can freely flow away without coming into contact with other parts of the objects.
