# Method and apparatus for sensing and maintaining color registration.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for automatically sensing and for maintaining registration of each of the color cylinders utilized in a multi color printing press is disclosed. Predetermined register marks are printed in the non image areas on the sheet to be printed. Typically, in a four color printing process, the black image is used as a reference, and registration of the other three image colors is achieved relative to the black image. Accordingly, a register mark for each process color is printed in the same location as a corresponding black reference register mark. The reference register marks are configured such that the average reflectance of the printed overlay will change as the the registration of the color image changes with respect to the black image. In general, the configuration of the register marks for the black and color images differs. The reflectance of each printed overlay is measured on the printing press, while the sheet is moving. One type of sensor that can be used for this measurement is an on press densitometer, or more generally, a reflectometer. If desired, the reflectance information obtained thereby can be converted to a registration error signal and used to achieve automatic, closed loop control of the position of each of the color cylinders.

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SENSING AND MAIN TAINING COLOR REGISTRATIONThe present invention relates to a color registration system for a multi color printing press and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for sensing and for maintaining the registration of each of the color printers utilized in conventional multi color printing presses.Three and four color process printing is closely allied with color photography. The fundamentals of color reproduction are much the same for all the printing processes.Frequently, only three colors are used with black added in the more commonly used four color process. The halftone screens for each color are printed at differing angles, so that the dots fall one alongside another and overlap to form combinations of many colors. Inks for process printing are transparent tones of red, blue and yellow.Since three plates four for four color processes must be obtained in order to print the proportionate parts of the different colors, first steps involve breaking down a colored original into three or four separate photographic images employing wellknown techniques using separation filters. These photographic images are termed separation negatives.Although it is theoretically possible to print the full range of tones using only three process colors, operators usually include a black printer to add detail and contrast to the printed reproduction.To make the separation negative for the black printer, the same general procedure used for the other separation negatives is folbwed. From each of the separation negatives, a positive print is made. A positive represents tonal values reversed from those in the negative, so that the positive made from the redfilter negative will represent all colors except red, in other words, minus red. White light minus red leaves bluegreen, generally called cyan, the color in which this posi tive should be printed. A green filter negative produces a positive which must be reproduced in minus green, which is bluish red, generally called magenta. The blue filter negative, in turn, gives a positive which must be printed as minus blue, or yellow. When the three positives are brought together one over the other in exact alignment, the original image is recreated.The steps followed from the breaking down of a colored original into separation negatives to the generation of combined positive prints vary according to the particular graphic arts process used. For example, in offset lithography the separation negatives are each photographed through a halftone screen to give a screened positive from which three or four printing plates are made. These plates are printed, superimposed in register, for the generation of the proper color of the final reproduction.Although there are numerous types of designs of printing presses, most share the problem of having to print multiple single color images which are accurately located, or registered, with respect to one another. The tolerable error with respect to ideal register depends on the particular application, but is often in the range of 0,025 mm.In order to achieve proper register, the printing press operator must make appropriate mechanical adjustments of the printing press in both longitudinal i.e., in the direction of paper motion and lateral dimensions. Once initial registration is achieved in the make ready phase of press operation, the relative registration of the separate color images is likely to change as the printing press runs.Typical causes of this misregistration include fluctuations in the speed of operation, changes in ambient conditions and varying characteristics of theprint substrate. isIt is apparent that once the printing press running, the effect of misregistration is to degrade the sharpness and color quality of the final printed image. Accordingly, it is of advantage to be able to determine the degree of registration quite often during the running of the press, in that slight misregistration be sensed and corrected before it becomes intolerable. Once information as to the relative registration of the single color images is available, the printing press can be adjusted, either manually or automatically, to correct any misregistration.Known color registration sensing methods utilize sensors that operate by the measurement of register marks printed along with the color images. This class of sensors embodies the basic principle that longitudinal registration errors result in a change in the relative time at which the register marks are measured by the sensor. In one known implementation, lateral registration is determined by measuring the relative timing of two kinds of register marks, one perpendicular to and one skew to the direction of paper motion. Both marks must be measured before lateral registration can be determined, since the timing of the skew mark is dependent upon both the longitudinal and lateral registration.There are several limitations and drawbacks associated with the Xnown color registration measurement methods. Specifically, they do not provide for independent measurement of registration in two dimensions. Lateral registration measurement requires that longitudinal registration first be measured, and its value used to compute lateral registration.Thus, errors in measuring longitudinal registration will affect the determination of lateral registration.Moreover, they require knowledge of paper speed, since they are based on measuring the relative timing of register marks.Errors in determining paper speed can, therefore, introduce errors in the measurement of registration.And, finally, they can be adversely affected by the effects of fill in and slur on the printed registration marks, and do not compensate for such adverse effects.It is, accordingly, a general object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for sensing and maintaining the registration of each of the color printers uti lized in conventional multi color printing presses. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the aforementioned limitations and drawbacks associated with the known techniques.It is a particular object of the invention to provide a color registration sensing method that independently senses longitudinal and lateral registration.It is another object of the invention to provide a color registration sensing method that does not require knowledge of paper speed.It is still another object of the invention to provide a color registration sensing method that compensates for the potentially adverse effects of fill in and slur on the printed register marks.It is a further object of the invention to provide a color registration sensing method whereby the sensitivity of the registration measurement and the range of registration that can be sensed can be changed through the choice of register marks.The foregoing and other objects and advantages which will be apparent from the flowing detailed description of the preferred embodiment, or, in the practice of this invention, are achieved by a method for sensing the color registration of a printing press having the capability of printing a process color, characterized in that said method comprises the steps of a printing at predetermined locations in the nonimage areas of a medium to be printed at least one reference register mark for the process color whose registration is to be sensed b overlaying color register marks with each said reference register marks and c measuring the average reflectance of the overlay of reference and color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the registration of the process color being printed. For sensing the color registration of a multi color printing press having a printer for a reference color and printers for a first, second and third process color, the method of this invention includes the steps of a printing with the reference color printer at predetermined locations in the non image areas of a sheet to be printed at least one reference register mark corresponding to each of the first, second and third process colors b overlaying with each of the reference register marks corresponding to the first process color a corresponding number of first process color register marks c measuring the average reflectance of each of the overlayed reference and first process color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the registration of the first process color printer d overlaying with each of the reference register marks corresponding to the second process color a corresponding number of second process color register marks e measuring the average reflectance of each of the overlayed reference and second process color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the registration of the second process color printer f overlaying with each of the reference register marks corresponding to the third process color a corresponding number of third process color register marks and g measuring the average reflectance of each of the overlayed reference and third process color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the registration of the third process color printer.A preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to maintaining the color registration of a multi color printing press having printers for the colorsblack,cyan, magenta and yellow, said method comprising the steps of a printing with the black color printer at predetermined locations in the non image areas of a sheet to be printed at least one reference register mark corresponding to each of the colors cyan, magenta and yellow b overlaying with the cyan printer with each of the black reference register marks corresponding to the color cyan a corresponding number of cyan register marks c measuring the average

for sensing the color registration of a printing press having the capability of printing one or more process color s , said apparatus comprising a reference color printing means for printing at perdetermined locations in the non image areas of a medium to be printed at least one reference register mark for the process color whose registration is to be sensed b process color printing means for overlaying color register marks with each of said reference register marks and c reflectometer means for measuring the average reflectance of the overlayed reference and color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the registration of the process color.A preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention for sensing the color registration of a multi color printing press having the capability of printing a reference color,a first, second and third process color comprises a reference color printing means for printing at predetermined locations in the non image areas of a sheet to be printed at least one reference register mark corresponding to each of the first, second and third process colors b first, second and third process color printing means for

marks c reflectometer means for measuring the average reflectance of each of the overlayed reference and first, reference and second and reference and third process color register marks, said average reflectance being representative of the color registration of the first, second and third process color, respectively.In accordance with the teachings of the invention, predetermined reference register marks are printed at predetermined locations in the non image areas of a substrate to be printed such that thesis at least one reference register mark for each of the process colors whose registration is to be sensed. A corresponding number of color register marks for each of the process colors are printed in the same location as their corresponding reference register marks. The average reflectance of each of the overlays of reference and color register marks is measured. The average reflectance is representative of the registra tion of the process colors being printed. The reflectance information is readily converted to a registration error signal and utilized to achieve closed loop control of the individual color cylinders employed to print the process colors.The effects of printing press variables, such as varying re flectance of the black and color inks, as well as slur and fill in variations, are compensated by measuring the re flectance of diagnostic patterns, or color bars, which pro vide quantitative information about the above described va riations. This information is used to largely remove the effects of press variations from the registration error signal. Serving to illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the inven tion are the appended drawings. Fig. 1 illustrates typical ways in which reference register marks, in accordance with the present invention, can be printed in non image areas on a substrate to be printed upon Fig. 2A illustrates a typical configuration of a black re ference register mark Fig. 2B illustrates a typical configuration of a color re gister mark Fig. 2C illustrates an overlay of the typical register marks illustrated in Fig. 2A and 2B Fig. 3 illustrates a method for sensing registration in the longitudinal dimension Fig. 4 illustrates a block diagram of a registration control system Fig. 5 illustrates in greater detail certain aspects of Fig. 3 Fig. 6 illustrates a black reference register mark consist ing of a clear rectangle with black surround and overlayed color register mark and Fig. 7 illustrates the form of color bars used to measure slur and fill in. The present invention utilizes measurements of the average reflectance of overlayed register marks to effect automatic registration of the different process colors employed in a multi color printing press. Typically, a reference register mark is associated with the color black and a color register mark is associated with each process color to be printed. Thus, in a typical four color system, there would be at least one black reference register mark for each of the process colors cyan, magenta and yellow . In addition, there would be at least one color register mark corresponding to each of the process colors. Registration of the color register marks is achieved relative to the corresponding black register marks.Fig. 1 illustrates the manner in which reference register marks having a predetermined configuration can be printed in predefined non image areas on a substrate to be printed either on a web or sheet fed printing press. As shown inFig. 1, the substrate 1 is moving, in the direction of the solid arrow, typically at speeds up to 91,50 m min., depending upon the type of printing press. A reflectometer 2, such as described in GB 1 521 443, is disposed above the substrate, in such a position as to measure the reflectance of selected portions of the substrate. Two reference register marks 3 and 4 are printed along the margin of the substrate and can be measured sequentially by the reflectometer 2. Additionally, reference register marks can be printed between consecutive impressions 5 and 6.It is often the case that a set of color bars 7 is printed in this region, and is measured by the reflectometer 2, as it is translated laterally across the printed substrate. Two reference register marks 8 and 9 are shown printed adjacent to the color bars.As with the reference register mark, the color register mark can be printed along the margin of the substrate, or adjacent to the color bars.Color bars are diagnostic patterns printed in non image areas for the purpose of quality control of certain aspects of the printing process. Representative patches of solid ink of the process color inks can be monitored by the reflectometer 2 in order to sense variations in the flow of ink. Screened patterns can also be included so that variations in the ability of the printing press to maintain predetermined halftone dot sizes can be monitored. Additionally, further special color bar patterns can be used to sense such printing variables as slur and fill in.Slur is defined as a directional change in the area of a printed halftone dot, and occurs in the direction of paper travel through the press. Fill in is a radial increase in dot size compared to the film. Both of these variations will affect the size of halftone dots. However, they also have an effect on printed register marks, as will be described in a later section.The black reference register marks as well as the color register marks can be considered to be additional types of color bars, to be used for measurement and control of registration, an important printing press variable.The printing of color bars is achieved by including them in the artwork used for each of the color separations. Thus, all black color bars or components of color bars are included in the black separation. These black color bars bear a fixed geometrical relationship to the black image area.Likewise, the cyan, magenta and yellow color bars are included in the corresponding artwork for the cyan, magenta and yellow separation images.As a result of the fixed geometrical relationship of each color bar to the corresponding color image artwork, the printed color bars bear the same geometrical relationship to the corresponding color images.Thus, as the location of each color image varies with respect to the black image, the process color bar locations vary in the same fashion relative to the black color bars.Since the registration color bars are overlays of each process color and black, relative motion of the color and black images alters the detailed structure of the overlay of register marks. The above mentioned geometrical relationship between color bars and the printed image is necessary only for color bars used as register marks.It is not always practical to measure more than one color bar per printed impression. However, since registration usually changes slowly between impressions, acquisition of measurements from different impressions can be relied upon for the measurement of registration. Measurements of other diagnostic color bar information can be averaged for the case when printing variables are changing from impression to impression, but it is the underlying average value that is needed.Fig. 2A illustrates a reference register mark 11 having a predetermined configuration and which is printed with the black printer. As shown, it consists of an open, or clear, area 10A, surrounded by a solid region lOB having a circular boundary.The configuration of the color register marks 12 corresponding to each of the color printers i.e., cyan, magenta and yellow is illustrated in Fig. 2B. The color register marks 12 consist of a solid, rectangular region. In order to enable the measurement of register, the color register mark 12 Fig. 2B must be printed in the same position as the black reference mark 11 Fig. 2A .Fig. 2C illustrates a representation of such an overlay with no misregistration between the black and color images associated with the reference 11 and color register marks 12, respectively.Fig. 3 illustrates the manner in which the overprinted register patterns can be used to measure registration. The color register mark 12 has a right hand boundary 13 that defines the amount of clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11 that is covered by the solid color ink. The circular boundary 14 denotes the perimeter of the region for which reflectance is measured by the reflectometer.The reflectance of the region within the boundary 14 is the areaweighted sum of four sub regions 1 clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11 not covered by solid color ink of the color register mark 12 2 clear area 10A of the re ference register mark 11 covered by solid color ink of the color register mark 12 3 black ink area lOB of the reference register mark 11 not overlayed with solid color ink of the color register mark 12 and 4 black ink area lOB of the reference register mark 11 overlayed with solid color ink of the color register mark 12.It is observed that if the color register mark 12 is moved towards the right, moving its right hand boundary 13 to position 15, then the areas of these four sub regions will change, resulting in a decrease of average reflectance. Similarly, it is noted that the shape of the upper curved boundary 16 of the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11 has an effect on the change in average reflectance.When the registration error is large enough that the righthand boundary 13 of the color register mark 12 reaches the right hand edge 19 of the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11, then any further reduction in average reflectance is small. Indeed, if the reflectances of the solid black lOB and solid color areas of the reference register mark 11 and color register mark 12, respectively, are zero, then the reflectance will undergo no more reduction as the right hand boundary 13 of the color register mark 12 moves past the right hand edge 19 of clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11. Likewise, for a displacement of the color register pattern toward the left, the average reflectance will increase until the right hand boundary 13 of the color register mark 12 reaches the left hand edge 20 of the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11. Beyond this point, reflectance will increase slowly, if at all.It should be clear that the average reflectance measured by the reflectometer will be a monotonic function of registration and will vary at least over the horizontal extent of the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11, as measured from left hand edge 20 to right hand edge 19.Accordingly, the measured value of average reflectance can be used as an error signal in a registration control system, since the reflectance measurement will give an indication of the direction and the degree of misregistration.In Fig. 4 a registration control system is illustrated showing conventional electronic means 30, such as a microcomputer, utilized to convert the measured value of average reflectance to a registration error signal which is then inputted to a conventional analog or digital closed loop control circuit 31, interfaced to the printing press cylinder registration mechanism, thereby effecting automatic color registration of the process color printer whose color registration is being sensed.It is noted that choice of the shape and size of the clear area 10A of the black reference register mark 11 will affect the extent over which the error signal will vary, as well as the rate of change of the error signal. The rate of change will affect the sensitivity of the technique. Fig. 3 .It is also noted that for vertical motion of the color register mark 12, there will be no change in average reflectance until the lower 17 or upper 18 boundary of the color register mark crosses the circular boundary 14 that defines the region over which reflectance is measured. More specifically, the setup shown in Fig. 3 is configured to sense registration errors in the longitudinal dimension. For small lateral registration errors, it is insensitive. A similar pair of register marks, rotated 900, would be used to sense registration errors in the lateral dimension.It is further noted that errors in the location of the circular boundary 14 will have a small effect on the measured results, so long as the boundary neither extends out of the black area lOB nor into the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11. This is because the contribution to average reflectance from the black regions 10B and black and color overprint 10C is small, and so changes in the black region result in small average reflectance changes. Errors in the location of the bt ry 14 can result frola inaccuracies in positioning the reflectometer relative to the register marks.A more rigorous mathematical treatment of the present invention is given with reference to Fig. 5. As shown therein,an x,y coordinate system is defined such that the lower boundary 21 of the clear area 10A of the reference register mark 11 lies along the x axis, with the origin 22 at its center. As illustrated, the lower boundary 21 extends from x D to X D. The left and right hand boundaries 20 and 19, respectively, are parallel to the y axis and extend from y O in the positive y direction.Thus, when the color register mark 12 is misregistered by an amount 8 as when its right hand boundary 13 moves to location 15 , the average reflectance within the circular boundary 14 is given byEMI14.1 where r c reflectance of color printed on paper rp reflectance of paper r cb reflectance of color overlayed with black rb reflectance of black printed on paper P radius of measured area included in circular noundary 14 f x functional form of the shape of the upper boundary 16 of the black reference register mark For purposes of illustration, assume that the reflectance of the black ink is sufficiently small that it can be ignored.Then setting rb rcb O in equation 1 , results inEMI15.1 The rate of change of the average reflectance as a function of misregistration 8 determines the sensitivity of the error signal to registration errors. This rate of change is found by differentiating equation 2 with respect toEMI15.2 Thus, from equation 3 , it is seen that the functional form of the rate of change of the error signal i.e., sensitivity is exactly the same as the functional form f x that defines the shape of the black reference register mark. Thus, it is clear that the configuration of the register marks affects the sensitivity of the technique. The sensitivity is also seen to be proportional to the difference between paper and colored ink reflectance.It is, therefore, of advantage to maximize this difference by designing the reflectometer with color selection filters that minimize the measured reflectance of the colored ink. Of course, equation 3 is not strictly true because of the assumption that rb rCb 0.However, it does help to describe how the sensitivity of registration measurement is affected by the configuration of the reference register mark.The method of sensing registration described above does not necessarily require the use of register marks having the configurations illustrated in Fig. 2A and 2B. Any shape of clear area with a black surround can be used for the black reference register mark. Similarly, the color register mark can also have any complex shape, so long as the average reflectance of the overlay is a rrpnotonic function of misregistration. However, unless the color register mark is constant in one dimension, the method is not independent of misregistration in that dimension.Additionally, the black reference register mark can consist of a black region with a clear surround, but this configuration is more sensitive to errors in positioning the boundary 14, and so is not to be preferred.One of the simplest forms the black reference register mark can take is that of a clear rectangle with black surround. This register mark is shown in Fig. 6, with the color register mark 12 overlayed. For no misregistration 8 O , the clear area 10A of the black reference register mark 11 is half covered by the color register mark 12. The functional form of the black register mark 11 is given by the following expression f x H, tx f W 4 The rate of change or sensitivity of the error signal is found from equation 3 to beEMI16.1 which is constant over the range It 4 W. This rate of change cannot be made any larger without increasing the height H of the black reference register mark 11. This dimension is limited by the size of the measured area 14.Thus, one cannot exceed the sensitivity of a rectangular reference register mark 11 of height H with any other shaped mark of maximum y dimension H. For this reason as well as the fact that the rectangular mark is of simple form, the rectangular mark is the preferred configuration of the black reference register mark 11.It should be noted that the height H of the rectangular reference register mark shown in Fig. 6 can be increased so that it extends beyond the boundary 14 of the measured area, or even to the outside boundary of the solid black area. Since registration is being measured in a dimension parallel to the width of the rectangle, then the above described reference register mark will achieve the purposes of the invention. However, this type of reference register mark will result in a registration control system that is more sensitive to errors in positioning of the measured area along the dimension for which registration is to be sensed. This error arises primarily because of changes in the size and shape of the unprinted clear area that lies within the measured area, since the upper and lower boundaries are defined by the measured area. For these reasons, it is recommended that the clear area of the reference register mark be completely enclosed within the measured area.It should also be noted that the roles of the black reference and color register marks, as shown in Fig. 6, can be reversed. That is, the black reference register marks can be solid rectangles of the same form as the color register mark 12 in Fig. 6. The color register marks can be a clear rectangle surrounded by solid color, of the same form as the black reference register mark 11 in Fig. 6. The same argument is applicable to the more general form of the register marks, as shown in Fig. 5Variations in the reflectance or optical density, where density is the negative logarithm of reflectance of the solid black and color inks will occur on a printing press, and will affect the measured reflectance of the overlay of register marks.Since the effect of such variations on the average reflectance is predictable, measurement of the reflectance of solid patches of the black and color inks can be used to compensate for such variations. Solid patches of the inks are therefore included with the color bars in a nonimage area. The equation used to compensate for density variations is given after a discussion of slur and fill in see equation 14 .Slur and fill in are two more press variables that can adversely affect the register marks. Their effect on dots was previously described. However, slur can shift the position of a trailing edge, and fill in can shift the position of both leading and trailing edges. These effects can change the structure of the register marks, and can vary independently for the different printing units of a multi color press. The effects of slur and fill in can, therefore, result in a change of average reflectance, thereby introducing an error into the registration sensing method.For example, if the paper is moving toward the left in Fig.6, the trailing edge the left hand border of the reference register mark 11 and the right hand edge of the color register mark 12 can be shifted toward the right by slur and fill in, and the leading edge the right hand edge of the reference register mark 11 can be shifted toward the left by fill in. In addition, the top and bottom edges of the reference register mark can be shifted by fill in toward the clear area. As a result, the clear area 10 that is not overlayed with the color register mark will decrease in size, so that the average reflectance of the overlay will decrease. This result is indistinguishable from a positive registration error, for which the color register mark will shift towards the right, and the average reflectance will decrease. Without compensation, then slur and fill in can limit the accuracy to which registration can be sensed.Compensation for slur and fill in can be accomplished by using particular color bar patterns designed for measurement of these variables. See, e.g., Milton Pearson et al, Instrumenation for the Measurement of Slur and Fill in on aLithographic Web Press , Technical Association of theGraphic Arts Proceedings, 1979, p. 162. These patterns are shown in Fig. 7 and consist of linear bars, with bar width equal to bar spacing. One pattern 32 is printed with the bars parallel to the direction of paper motion, and is used to sense the effect of fill in in the lateral dimension. The other pattern 33 is printed with the bars perpendicular to the direction of paper motion, and is used to sense the effect of slur and fill in in the longitudinal dimension. In either dimension, the effect of slur and or fill in is to broaden the width of the printed bars. The reflectance of these two patterns will decrease as the effects of slur and fill in are introduced. The actual increase in line width can be found by measuring the reflectance of the two slur patterns described above using an on press densitometer or reflectometer, and the following equations from thePearson reference Relative area of printed parallel linesRelative area of printed perpendicular linesRelative area of parallel lines on filmRelative area of perpen dicular lines on filmFill in itirn Slur mm EMI19.1 where Dii Optical Density of Parallel Lines D1 Optical Density of Perpendicular Lines n 1.7 D Optical Density of Negative Film n 11 of Parallel Lines D Optical Density of Negative Film nl of Perpendicular Lines Equations 8 and 9 can be alternately expressedEMI20.1 EMI20.2 are measured from positive film.The measurements of slur and fill in can be converted to changes in the dimensions of the clear area of the overlay of register marks. Referring to Fig. 6, four cases are considered 1. Paper motion to left 2. Paper motion to right 3. Paper motion upward 4. Paper motion downwardThe direction of paper motion relative to the register marks will determine which edges are leading and trailing edges, and which edges are sensitive to registration errors. For cases 1. and 2., the overlay is designed to sense registration. For cases 3. and 4., the overlay is independent of registration errors in the direction perpendicular to the direction for which the overlay is designed.
