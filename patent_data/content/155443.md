# Microocomputer data processing systems permitting bus control by peripheral processing devices.

## Abstract
A microcomputer system includes a main processor 1 , a memory 3 and a direct memory access controller DMA 4 effective to control direct data transfer between the memory and input output devices on channels. Bus control for data transfer is switchable between the DMA and processor by a hold request acknowledge handshaking sequence between the DMA and processor. A control line 27 from the channels is activated by a peripheral processing device on a channel when it wishes to gain control of the busses for data transfer. Logic means co act with the handshaking sequence to determine which device gains control of the busses. This logic is responsive to the DMA address enable output AEN , the hold acknowledge output of the main processor HLDA and the channel control line output MASTER . When all these are deactivated, control passes to the main processor, when AEN and HLDA only are activated, control passes to the DMA controller and, when all three are activated, control passes to the peripheral processing device.
