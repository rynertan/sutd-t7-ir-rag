# Control of a cross helical rolling mill.

## Abstract
A method controlling the operation of a cross helical rolling mill. The cross helical rolling mill has a pair of work rolls arranged at respective predetermined lead angles, and a pair of power driven drive roller shoes arranged obliquely at predetermined lead angles on both sides of the rolling region formed between both work rolls. The method com prises controlling the rotation speed of each of the drive roller shoes in synchronism with the speed of rotation of the rolled material such that the difference in the peripheral speed between each of the drive roller shoe and the rolled material falls within a predetermined range, and, simul taneously with the control of the speed, controlling the driving torque applied to each of the drive roller shoes. According to the method, the drive roller shoes impart driving torques to the rolled material, while maintaining the slip between the shoes and the rolled material within a predetermined allowable range, so that the material under the rolling can be held safely and stably, whereby the quality of the rolled product is improved and the life of the shoes is prolonged. Disclosed also is an apparatus for carrying out this method.
