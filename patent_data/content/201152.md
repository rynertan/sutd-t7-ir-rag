# FLUIDIZABLE CRACKING CATALYST COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A fluidizable catalyst composition for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon fractions, the composition com prising a zeolitic particles of relatively high catalytic activ ity and comprising Y faujasite in a matrix containing at least a portion of silica alumina and b alumina based additive particles which are relatively inert towards catalytic crack ing and comprise calcium oxide alumina particles to act as a vanadium immobilization agent, the zeolitic particles after steam treatment in a fluidized bed reactor at 1450 F for four hours using 90 volume flowing steam plus 10 air at mosphere displaying a weight percent conversion of at least 70 when tested using the feedstock of Table III in the microactivity test of ASTM D.3907 80, the reactor being op erated at 910 F, the catalyst to oil weight ratio being 5, and the weight hourly space velocity being 15h . The composi tion resists degeneration due to vanadium contaminant in the hydrocarbon feed.
