# COOKING OVEN HAVING AT LEAST ONE RADIANT ELEMENT

## Abstract
An oven comprises at least one radiant element 1 mounted substantially parallel to an upright wall 3 thereof, a reflective sheet 2 spaced from the wall 3 and having a rear surface capable of substantially inhibiting radiant heat transfer, so as to reflect radiant energy from the element 1 away from the wall 3 . The oven also includes an oven liner 6 having an air outlet 10 situated adjacent the top thereof, so as to allow circulating air heated by the element 1 to re enter the oven cavity 5 from a space 7 formed between the wall 3 and the oven liner 6 , thus substantially increasing the air flow over the element 1 .
