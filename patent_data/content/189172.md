# Steering system for automotive vehicle or the like.

## Abstract
In order to simplify the construction of a power steering system and simultaneously allow for unassisted steering in the event that the motor 9 or the like of the system malfunctions, the differential gear 4 which established the drive connection between the auxiliary motor 9 , the steering input shaft 2 and the steering output shaft 3 is such that when the element of the differential gear 4 which is connected to a variable speed motor 9 is not driven by the motor 9 , an essentially 1 1 drive is established between the steering input and output shafts 2,3 while at thise time the motor driven element is braked on ly by the friction and other natural resistances which occur in the system. Further, the differential gear 4 is such as to have a relatively low responsiveness to the rotational speed of the motor 9 and thus eliminates the need for a reduction gear between the motor 9 and the differential gear 4 .
