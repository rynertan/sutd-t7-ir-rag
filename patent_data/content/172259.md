# Fire retardant fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition.

## Abstract
A fire retardant fiber reinforced polyamide resin com position comprising a polyamide resin mixture composed of a a polyamide resin derived from a xylylenediamine and a linear aliphatic dibasic acid and b nylon 66, the amount of the polyamide resin a being 70 to 97 by weight based on the weight of the mixture, and 10 to 150 parts, per 100 parts by weight of the polyamide resin mixture, of glass fibers, said resin composition further comprising 5 to 30 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight, of the polyamide resin mixture, of a fire retardant, said fire retardant consisting of 1 part by weight of antimony trioxide and 1 to 6 parts by weight of brominated polystyrene.
