# Process for preparing a mycophenolic acid derivative.

## Abstract
A novel process of preparing mycophenolic acid gluco side useful in the treatment of psoriasis and gout comprises contacting mycophenolic acid with glucose in the presence of a glucosylating enzyme produced by streptomyces aureofa ciens NRRL 2209 or by streptomyces candidus NRRL 5449 in an aqueous medium until a substantial amount of mycophenol ic acid glucoside is produced.
