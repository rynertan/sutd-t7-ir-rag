# Radial piston fluid translating device with power conserving scavenging means.

## Abstract
In a pump or fluid motor 11, 11a, 11b having a closed chamber 57 in which cylinders 38 orbit and reciprocate, leakage and cooling fluid which accumulates in the chamber 57 is formed into a rotating annular volume by centrifugal effects and exhibits a higher pressure in the region where the cylinders 38 move radially inward and closer together than in the opposite region where the cylinders 38 move outward and further apart. Power wastage from drag torque, turbul ence and heat generation is reduced by scavenging the accumulated fluid from the chamber 57 . Internal recircula tion of the scavenged fluid from the high pressure portion of the annular rotating volume back to the low pressure portion is avoided by communicating the drain passages 68, 68a, 68b with only a limited relatively high pressure sector of the rotating volume of fluid.
