# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CULTURE OF ANIMAL CELLS

## Abstract
There is described a method and apparatus for the culture of animal cells. The apparatus comprises a culture vessel 1 for culturing animal cells, gas supply means 21, 22, 23, 24 connected to the culture vessel 1 and provided with flow volume control means 17, 18, 19, 20 for control ling the flow volumes of at least nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, flow volume measuring means 25, 26, 27, 28 for measuring the flow volumes of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, detection means 36, 37 for detecting the pH value and the dissolved oxygen concentration of the culture broth within the culture vessel 1 , and a control circuit 50 . The control circuit is adapted to receive signals from the measuring means 25, 26, 27, 28 and the detection means 36, 37 , to increase or decrease the flow volume of carbon dioxide in response to the pH value signal thereby control ling the pH value to a prescribed level, to calculate the variations in the flow volumes of nitrogen and oxygen at the same time, necessary for compensating for the variation in the partial pressure of oxygen in the gaseous phase caused by the increase or decrease of the flow volume of carbon dioxide, to control the flow volume control means 17, 18, 19, 20 in accordance with the results of said calculation thereby to vary the flow volumes of nitrogen and oxygen, to calculate the flow volumes of nitrogen and oxygen necessary for controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration at a pre scribed level in accordance with the dissolved oxygen concentration signal, and to control the flow volume control means 17, 18, 19, 20 in accordance with the results of said calculations thereby to vary the flow volume of carbon dioxide.
