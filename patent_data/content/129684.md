# PREPARATION OF HYDROXYCITRONELLOL

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of hydroxycit ronellol by an addition reaction of water with citronellol. This reaction takes place directly on heating a homogeneous solu tion of citronellol in a mixture of water and an inert solvent selected from the group consisting of acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, glymes, and tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is catal yzed with a cation exchange resin.
