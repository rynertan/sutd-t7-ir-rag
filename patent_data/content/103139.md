# Reagent composition for immunoassay and immunoassay using the same.

## Abstract
Immunoassay which can be performed within a short period of time and a reagent composition for such immu noassay. The reagent composition contains complement and cells which contain quantitatively determinable sub stance therein. Antibody or antigen corresponding to anti gen or antibody to be determined in a sample is bound on the outer surfaces of the cell membranes, which can be lysed by the complement upon activation thereof. In the immunoassay, a sample containing antigen or antibody to be determined is mixed with the reagent composition. The complement is activated by the resultant antigen antibody complex. The cell membranes are lysed by the complex and the determinable substance in the cells is liberated from the cells. The amount of the liberated substance is determined.
