# Manufacture of chipboard.

## Abstract
Chipboard showing a strongly reduced formaldehyde emission is prepared on the basis of cellulose containing material with a urea formaldehyde or urea melamine formaldehyde resin as a binder, wherein said binder contains 0.45 to 0.65 mole of formaldehyde per mole equivalent of amino groups and to which between 2 and 20 by wt., relative to the resin, of a protein soluble or dispersible in the resin solution has been added. The resin preferably contains bet ween 25 and 45 by wt. of melamine, relative to the combined amount of urea and melamine. The boards have good strength and weather resistance, and have a very low formal dehyde emission.
