# A cable splice assembly with an improved cable strain relief and a cable strain relief device.

## Abstract
There is provided an electrical cable splice assembly 10 , including a splice case 12 having two ports 34 for receiving a pair of cable ends 78, 80 . The conductors within the cable are adapted to be spliced together inside the splice closure. A pair of cable clamping devices 40, 42 are each firmly attached to each cable 30, 32 a certain distance removed from the splice closure. A rigid member 14 , having a pair of rigid arms 44, 46 , attaches the cable clamping devices 40, 42 directly to one another so that any strain applied on one cable is trans ferred to the other and the splices 22 within the splice clo sure are not subjected to the effects of the strain. There is fur ther provided a clamping ring 84 attached to the assembly for receiving a rod 90 to be buried in the ground such that the height of the assembly 10 with respect to the ground can be varied during installation.
