## Description
The invention relates to an adaptation circuit, for operating a high pressure discharge lamp, provided with a first and a second input terminal intended for connection of a supply source and with a first and a second output terminal intended for connection of a high pressure discharge vessel of the high pressure discharge lamp, each input terminal being connected to the respective output terminal, the connection between the first input terminal and the first output terminal including a first controlled semiconductor switch, of which a control electrode is connected to a junction between a first and a second branch of a voltage division circuit, which is arranged parallel to the first semiconductor switch. The invention further relates to a lamp provided with the adaptation circuit. An adaptation circuit of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is known from USP 3,925,705. The known circuit permits the operation of a high pressure discharge lamp on an equipment provided with a stabilization ballast not adapted to the relevant lamp. Thus, besides a continuous improvement of the luminous efficacy of high pressure discharge lamps, saving of energy can he attained on an existing equipment whilst maintaining a desired illumination intensity. Variations in the voltage of the supply source will lead, when using the known circuit, to variations in the control of the semiconductor switch and accordingly to variations in the lamp current and the lamp power. Variations in a voltage or a current are to be understood herein to mean variations in the value of the root of the time averaged square of the value of the relevant voltage or current, the so called RMS value. In the case of power, variations are considered with respect to the value averaged in time. High pressure discharge lamps in many cases exhibit during their lifetime a variation in lamp voltage, lamp current and lamp power due to ageing processes in the lamp. Both variations in lamp properties due to voltage source variations and due to lamp ageing may be disadvantageous on the one hand for the lamp with increased lamp voltage and on the other hand for the adaptation circuit with increased lamp current. An increased lamp voltage may lead to the lamp being extinguished, because the reignition voltage required at the increased lamp voltage rises above the supply source voltage. An increased lamp current will result in a larger current flowing through the semicoductor switch and thus leads to a higher dissipation in the semiconductor switch. More particularly in the case of incorporation of the circuit for example in a lamp cap, this may give rise to problems. The invention has for its object to provide a means by which variations in the voltage of the supply source and variations in lamp properties are compensated for at least in part. For this purpose, according to the invention, an adaptation circuit of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the first branch of the voltage division circuit comprises voltage storage means, the voltage of which the lamp voltage, and which voltage has the same polarity as the voltage across the voltage division circuit. An advantage of the adaptation circuit according to the invention is that the voltage across the lamp influences the control or the first controlled semiconductor switch, as a result of which a more uniform lamp voltage is obtained. In an advantageous embodiment of the adaptation circuit, the voltage storage means dependent upon the lamp voltage are composed of a parallel combination of a capacitor and a resistor, these voltage storage means being connected to the second output terminal. For the time in which the first semiconductor switch is opened so non conducting , the voltage stored on the capacitor as voltage storage means acts as a voltage source, while for the time in which the switch is closed so conducting , the same capacitor is charged In the case of an adaptation circuit suitable for operation at a supply voltage having a periodically changing polarity, at least the parallel combination is connected to direct voltage terminals of a rectifier bridge while two alternating voltage terminals of this bridge are included in the voltage division circuit. Thus, it is achieved in a very simple manner that the voltage across the parallel combination forming the voltage storage means dependent upon the lamp voltage has the same polarity as the voltage across the voltage division circuit. In order to guarantee the proportionality between the capacitor voltage and the lamp voltage, in an advantageous embodiment of the adaptation circuit the rectifier bridge is provided with a third alternating voltage terminal and the third alternating voltage terminal forms part of the connection between the voltage storage means dependent upon the lamp voltage and the second output terminal. In this configuration, the parallel resistor of the voltage storage means dependent upon the lamp voltage at the same time serves to ensure that the proportionality between the capacitor voltage and the lamp voltage is maintained when the RMS value of the lamp voltage decreases. Since the voltage at the second output terminal is only proportional to the lamp voltage if the first semiconductor switch is closed, in a further embodiment, the connection between the parallel combination and the second output terminal includes a switch, which is closed only in case the first semi conductor switch is closed. Preferably, the connection between the parallel combination and the second output terminal includes a second resistor. This second resistor constitutes together with the resistor of the parallel combination the voltage division circuit which influences the ratio between the lamp voltage and the capacitor voltage. The switch is preferably a second controlled semiconductor switch, of which an electrode is connected to the first output terminal. Thus, control of the second controlled semiconductor switch by means of the instantaneous lamp voltage is achieved in a simple and therefore favourable manner. With the use of a supply source having a periodically changing polarity of the voltage and current of comparatively low frequency, such as public supply mains, the controlled semiconductor switches are preferably constructed as triacs because these elements automatically become non conducting upon change of polarity of the current. In other cases, for example in the case of supply with a direct voltage source, a separate circuit is required for rendering each of the semiconductor switches non conducting. An example of an adaptation circuit according to the invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows an electric circuit diagram of the adaptation circuit with a connected high pressure discharge lamp, Fig. 2 shows in a graph the variation of the instantaneous currents and the instantaneous voltages in the case of operation of the circuit shown in Fig.1, Fig. 3 shows a graphic representation of relations between lamp voltage and lamp power, Fig.4 shows a graphic representation of relations between lamp voltage and reignition voltage, Figures 5 and 6 show circuit diagrams of modifications of adaptation circuits. In Fig. 1, the connection terminals A and B of an alternating voltage supply source are connected to a first input terminal C and a second input terminal D, respectively, of an adaptation circuit 3. The connection between the connection terminal B and the input terminal D includes a stabilization ballast 2. The adaptation circuit is provided with a first output terminal E and a second output terminal F, to which a high pressure discharge vessel 1 is connected. Each input terminal C, D is connected to the respective output terminal E,F. The connection between the first input terminal C and the first output terminal E includes as the first controlled semiconductor switch a triac 4, of which a control electrode 41 is connected through a breakdown element in the form of a diac 8 to a junction G between a first branch 5 and a second branch 6 of a voltage division circuit. The first branch 5 is connected to the first input terminal C through a resistor 27. The second branch 6 comprises a parallel combination of a resistor 61 and a capacitor 62 and is connected to the first output terminal E. The first branch 5 includes two alternating voltage terminals H and I of a rectifier bridge composed of diodes 51,52,53 and 54 in series with a resistor 55. A parallel combination of a resistor 56 and a capacitor 57 forming the voltage storage means connected to the direct voltage terminals of the rectifier bridge of the first branch 5. The rectifier bridge is provided The operation of the circuit in the case of a burning lamp is as follows. In the case where the lamp is ignited, a lamp current I When the instantaneous voltage at the input terminals C,D falls to zero, the lamp current I Subsequently, current and voltage at the input terminals C,D will decrease again and will change their polarities, the process described being repeated. The resistor 17 ensures that in the non conductive stage of the triac 4, a small current constantly flows through the lamp the so called keep alive current , which ensures that ionization in the discharge vessel is maintained. This favours the limitation of the reignition voltage. In order to ensure that the switch 10 certainly becomes conducting after reignition of the lamp, a further capacitor can be connected between the control electrode 101 and the second output terminal F. The circuit comprising the Zener diodes 12 and 13 serves to ensure that the voltage division takes place between the branches 5 and 6 with respect to a voltage of constant value. It appears from the above description of the operation of the adaptation circuit that a residual charge is present at the capacitor 57 at the end of a polarity phase of the lamp current I At a constant RMS value of the lamp voltage,V For further illustration, Figures 2 In Fig.2,the time duration for which the semiconductor switch 4 is non conducting is indicated by t In the case of a practical circuit, this circuit is connected to a supply source of 220 V, 50 Hz, by means of which a high pressure sodium discharge lamp proportional for dissipation of 400 W is operated. The filling of the lamp contained 25 mg of amalgam, of which 21 by weight of Na and 79 of mercury, and xenon at a pressure of 45 kPa at 300 K. The components of the circuit were proportioned as follows In Fig.3, the RMS value of the lamp voltage V In the case of the adaptation circuit according to the prior art, this results in that the lamp voltage increases to 130 V and the average lamp power increases to 350 W. In the case of operation by the embodiment described of the adaptation circuit according to the invention, the average lamp power decreases to 320 W and the increase of the lamp voltage remains limited to about 2 V. The time duration for each half period of the supply voltage frequency in which the triac 4 is non conducting is in this case 1.04 ms. For further comparison, Fig.3 indicates the working points of the same lamp when operated directly connected to a supply source without the use of an adaptation circuit The point 30 is the working point in case the supply voltage has a constant RMS value of 220 V, while the point 31 is the working point at a supply voltage value of 242 V. Fig.4 indicates for each of the working points illustrated in Fig. 3 the value of the reignition voltage. The points in Fig. 4 relate to the working points illustrated in Fig. 3 as stated in the table below. Figures 5 and 6 show modifications of the adaptation circuit. The elements corresponding to those of Fig. 1 are designated by the same reference numerals. Fig. 5 shows the case in which as compared with Fig. 1 the input terminals C,D and the output terminals E,F are exchanged with respect to the control electrode 41 of the triac 4. In the circuit shown in Fig.6, the output terminals E,F are displaced as compared with the circuit shown in Fig. 5 and are arranged between the first switch 4 and the resistor 27. The voltage division circuit is thus connected in parallel both with the first switching element 4 and with the discharge vessel 1.
