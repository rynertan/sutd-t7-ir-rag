# End weighted reed sound transducer.

## Abstract
A cylindrical shell enclosure has mounted interiorly thereof in cantilever manner four upstanding laminated planar flexible resilient electroacoustic transducer reeds. A separate inertia weight is affixed to the top edge of each reed. An acoustic wave impinging on the side wall of the submerged enclosure will cause relative movement between the enclosure and a weight if the wave direction has a component transverse to the plane of the reed on which the weight is mounted. The reeds are mounted in quadrature so that wave direction detection is provided by comparing the electrical outputs of the reeds. Visco elastic damping pads may be affixed between the side ends of each of the weights and respective upstanding rigid arms secured to an interior surface of the enclosure.
