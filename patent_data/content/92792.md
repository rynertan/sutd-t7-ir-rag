# ROTABLE GRID

## Abstract
A rotatable grid, particularly for a domestic cooking range comprising an oven cavity and at least one conven tional planar grid shelf supported by guides affixed to the lateral walls of the oven cavity comprises a disk shaped grid and a support ring located therebelow in a concentric arrangement and connected thereto for rotation about a vertical axle. Upper and lower end portions of the axle are received in a freely rotatable fit in a hub member of the disk shaped grid and a bearing support member removably secured to the planar grid shelf, a disk of a low friction material being preferably interposed between the hub member and the bearing support member. The rotatable grid does not require any modification of the conventional design of the oven cavity and is adapted to be readily dismounted from the bearing support member for use of the grid shelf and facilitating cleaning of the oven cavity and its acces sories.
