# Apparatus for processing of sheet material in a liquid bath.

## Abstract
For developing double sided X ray film whether in piece or strip form, the film is passed through a series of tanks in each of which it is held between two bands 27 and 28 of woven plastics material which pass between scraper bars 37 and are driven by grooved rollers 29, 30 and 32 , the roller 33 being an idler. The scraper bars guide the bands in a sinuous path to ensure close contact between the bands and also squeeze processing liquid through the permeable bands, which are kept clean by the scraping action. The film enters between rollers 29 and 33 and is delivered between rollers 30 and 32 ans is firmly held throughout. The scraper bars are cheaper and more efficient, in conjunction with the bands, than the conventional transport rollers.
