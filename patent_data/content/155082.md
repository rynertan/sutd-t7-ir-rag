# EPOXY RESIN BONDED RARE EARTH IRON MAGNETS

## Abstract
Novel epoxy resin compositions and a method of using them to make bonded rare earth iron alloy magnets have been developed. The epoxy resins are polyglycidyl ethers of poly phenol alkanes that have high glass transition temperatures. The epoxy resin is provided in the form of a powder containing a suitable amount of a latent imidazole curing agent. The powder is mixed with rare earth iron alloy particles, the mixture is compacted, and the resultant compact is heated to melt the powder and activate the curing agent. The alloy particles in the resultant magnet body are exceptionally resistant to flux loss upon aging.
