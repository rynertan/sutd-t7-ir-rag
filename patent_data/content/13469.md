## Description
The present invention concerns oil soluble molybdenum complexes of oxazoline dispersants, their method of preparation, and the use of oil soluble molybdenum oxazoline dispersants as lubricating oil additives, which markedly improve the sludge dispersancy friction reducing properties of lubricating oils employed for crankcase lubrication of internal combustion engines. According to one embodiment of the invention, the oxazolines used are lactone oxazolines. During the past decade, ashless sludge dispersants have become increasingly important, primarily in improving the performance of lubricants in keeping the engine clean of deposits and permitting extended crankcase oil drain periods while avoiding the undesirable environmental impact of the earlier used metal containing additives. One commercial type of ashless dispersant contains nitrogen resulting from the attachment of an amine or polyamine to a long chain hydrocarbon polymer the oil solubilizing portion of the molecule , usually polyisobutylene, through an acid group, e.g. polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride, by forming amide or imide linkages.Other known dispersants include the reaction products of hydrocarbon substituted succinic anhydride, e.g. polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, with compounds containing both an amine group and a hydroxy group, such as shown in United Kingdom Specification 984,409, which teaches ashless amide imide ester type lubricant additives prepared by reacting an alkenylsuccinic anhydride, said alkenyl group having 30 to 700 carbon atoms, with a hydroxy amine including THAM. U.K. Patent Specifications 1,483,681 2 teach that the reaction of a hydrocarbyl dicarboxylic acid material, i.e. acid or anhydride or ester, with certain classes of amino alcohols under certain conditions, including metal salt promotion, will result in products containing one or two heterocyclic ring structures, namely, an oxazoline ring. Oil soluble lactone oxazolines are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,062,786. U.K. Specification 882,295 teaches a salt of molybdic acid and an amine having the tormulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different straight chain alkyl radicals having up to four carbons in the radical and R is an alkyl radical with the proviso that the radicals R1 and R2 have a total of 16 to 50 carbons to be useful as a friction reducing additive for mineral oil lubricants when a sulfur containing compound, e.g.zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate, is present. The salt has been produced by heating the molybdic acid and amine in a reaction mixture of mineral oil and water page 1, line 70 page 2, line 5 . While there are many known lubricant additives which may be classified as antiwear, antifriction and extreme pressure agents and some may in fact satisfy more than one of these functions as well as provide other useful functions but rarely if ever dispersancy, it is also known that many of these additives act in a different physical or chemical manner and often compete with one another, e.g. they may compete for the surface of the moving metal parts which are subjected to lubrication. The metal dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates, e.g.the zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates, are one of the additives which are known to exhibit antioxidant and anti wear properties. While they give excellent oxidation resistances and exhibit superior antiwear properties, it has heretofore been believed that the same increases or significantly limits their ability to decrease friction between moving surfaces. As a result, compositions containing zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates were not believed to provide the most desirable lubricity and, in turn, it was believed that use of compositions containing the same would lead to significant energy losses in overcoming friction even when antifriction agents are included in the composition. Known ways to solve the problem of energy losses due to high friction in crankcase lubrication include the use of synthetic ester base oils which are expensive and the use of insoluble molybdenum sulfide and graphite dispersions which have the disadvantage of giving the oil composition a black or hazy appearance. It would be desirable then to provide oil soluble molybdenum com pounds and thus overcome the disadvantage. Oil soluble molybdenum additives taught as useful in lubricating oils include the molybdates of organic nitrogen bases obtained from heating an aqueous solution of molybdic acid and an aliphatic amine or hetarocyclic nitrogen base seeU.S. Patent 3,144,712 . The practical exploitation of various types of molybdenum compounds and complexes as lubricant additives has been hindered not only by their insolubility and or corrosiveness but also by low thermal stability. It has now been discovered that ashless oxazo line dispersants can be reacted with a source of molyb denum to provide a molybdenum containing ashless dispersant of improved thermal stability in hydrocarbons, preferably lubricating oils and having the property of giving enhanced lubricity to said lubricating oil. This has been accomplished by use of an aqueous non aqueous reaction medium.The operational embodiment of the invention thus is a lubricating oil composition com prising a major proportion of mineral oil and a minor but friction reducing amount of an oil soluble molybdenum containing ashless oxazoline lubricating oil dispersant, said dispersant having from 0.5 to 20 wt. molybdenum based on the weight of said dispersant, and further characterized by from one to two oxazoline rings and a substantially saturated hydrocairbon group containing at least about 50 carbon atoms. If the lactone modification is used, then the dispersant also contains from one to two lactone rings. These materials are prepared from conventional ashless oxazoline dispersants by reaction of said dispersant with a molybdenum compound in a binary solvent system comprising an aqueous component of the class consisting of water and ammonium hydroxide and a non aqueous component of the class consisting of mineral oil, tetrahydrofuran THF and a hydrocarbon boiling between 70 and 250 C. The volume ratio of aqueous to non aqueous component ranges from 1 1000 to 1 1, preferably 1 100 to 1 4, optimally 1 10. The aqueous component can be considered a promoter for the molybdation of the oxazoline dispersant. Thus, both the water and the ammonium hydroxide could be defined as an essential promoter of molybdation in a non aqueous reaction medium. It has now been further discovered that a stable molybdenum complex can be obtained with little if any destruction of the ashless dispersant when complexing is effected at a temperature of 400 C. to 2500 C., preferably from 50 to 200 C., in said binary solvent system. In accordance with the present invention, it is preferred that the friction reducing additive is present in the mineral oil in an amount to provide from about 0.01 to 2.0, preferably 0.02 1.0 and optimally 0.05 0.5, weight percent molybdenum in said oil. All weight percent being based on the total weight of the lubricating composition. In preferred form, the molybdenum complex is that of an oxazoline dispersant additive derived from the reaction of one mole of a C8 to G400 hydrocarbyl substituted dicarboxylic acid material such as polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride wherein said hydrocarbyl sub stituert,, e.g. the polyisobutenyl group has a ranging from about 700 to 5,600, optimally from about 900 to 1600, with from one to two, preferably 1.5 to 2, molar equivalents of a 2,2 disubstituted 2 amino lalkanol having 2 to 3 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 4 to 8 carbon atoms by heating at a temperature of from 1400 C. to 2400 C. until cessation of water evolution.In preparing the lactone oxazoline modification, one mole of a C8 to C400 hydrocarbon substituted lactone acid material, such as polyisobutenyl lactone acid, is reacted with one mole equivalent of said 2 2 disub stituted 2 amino l alkanol. In each case, said additive being complexed with from 1 to 2 molar equivalents of molybdic oxide, i.e. MOO3 and containing from 0.5 to 20, preferably 2 to 10, optimally 5, wt. molybdenum. Generally, the dicarboxylic acid material, i.e. acid or anhydride or ester which is used to produce the oxazoline dispersants for complexing with molybdenum includes alpha beta unsaturated C4 to C10 dicarboxylic acid, or anhydrides or enters thereof, such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, chloromaleic acid, dimethyl fumarate, etc. These unsaturated acid materials are converted to the corresponding saturated acid material when reacted with a reactant having a long chain hydrocarbyl group. The long chain hydrocarbyl group, preferably a hydrocarbon chain containing at least 50 carbons branched or unbranched , is generally an olefin polymer chain, whereby oil solubility is provided. In general, these hydrocarbyl substituted dicarboxylic acid materials and their preparation are well known for example, see U.S. Patents 3,219,666 3,172,892 3,272,746 the aforementioned prior art patents as well as being commercially available, e.g., polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride. The dicarboxylic acid material can be illustrated by an alkenyl substituted anhydride which may contain a single alkenyl radical or a mixture of alkenyl radicals variously bonded to the cyclic succinic anhydride group with the alkenyl substituent containing from 8 to 400 carbons and preferably from 50 to 300 carbons. The anhydrides can be obtained by well known methods, such a s the Ene reaction between an olefin and maleic anhydride or halosuccinic anhydride or succinic ester U.S. Patent 2,568,876 . Suitable olefins include octene, decene, dodecene, tetradecene, hexadecene, octadecene, eicosene, and polymers of propylene, butene, isobutene, pentene, decene and theLike, and halogen containing olefins. The olefins may also contain cycloalkyl and aromatic groups. Preferred olefin polymers for reaction with the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids are polymers comprising a major molar amount of C2 to C5 monoolefin, e.g., ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene and pentene. The polymers can be homopolymers such as polyisobutylene, as well as copolymers of two or more of such olefins such as copolymers of ethylene and propylene butylene and isobutylene propylene and isobutylene etc. Other copolymers include those in which a minor amount of the copolymer monomers, e.g., 1 to 20 mole is a C4 to g8 non conjugated diolefin, e.g., a copolymer of isobutylene and butadiene or a copolymer of ethylene, propylene and 1,4 hexadiene etc. The olefin polymers will usually have number average molecular weights Mn within the range of about 700 and about 6,000, more usually between about 900 and about 5,600. Particularly useful olefin polymers have Mn s of about 1200 to 5000 with approximately one terminal double bond per polymer chain. An especially valuable starting material for a highly potent dispersant additive are polyalkenes e.g., polyisobutylene, having about 90 carbons. The hydrocarbyl substituent may also be a copolymer of 30 to 80 wt. X ethylene and 20 to 70 wt. of one or more C3 to C18 alpha olefin, preferably propylene having a number average molecular weight of 700 to 250,000, preferably 10,000 to 20Q,000 as determined by vapor pressure osmometry VPO . Terpolymers of ethylene, said alphaolefin and 0.5 to 20 mol , based on said total polymer, of a non conjugated diolef in, such as a hexadiene, may also be used. The hydrocarbyl substituent may also be a hydrogenated copolymer of butadiene and styrene or a terpolymer of a butadiene, styrene and isoprene. If the hydrocarbyl group has a molecular weight above 10,000 then the molybdenum containing dispersnat also has viscosity index improving properties. Generally, useful oil soluble oxazoline reaction products and their methods of preparation are fully described in United Kingdom Specifications 1,483,681 2. This oxazoline dispersant which forms a portion of the inventive combination can be characterized in its preferred form as an oil soluble product obtained from heating together a molar equivalent of a hydrocarbon substltuted C4 Clo dicarboxylic acid material having more than about 50 carbon atoms per dicarboxylic acyl group and from 1 to 2, preferably 1.5 to about 2, molar equivalents of a 2,2 disubstituted 2 amino l alkanol having 2 to 3 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 4 to 8 carbons at a temperature of from about 140 C. to 240 C. until cessation of water evolution indicating completion of the oxazoline reaction.This amino alkanol which readily produces the oxazoline rings requisite for this dispersant according to this invention can be represented by the formula EMI7.1 wherein X is an alkyl, or hydroxy alkyl group, with at least one of the X substituents being a hydroxy alkyl group of the structure CH2 nOH, wherein n is 1 to 3. Examples of such 2,2 disubstituted amino alkanols, include 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 hydroxy methyl l,3 propanediol also known as tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane or THAM , Z amino 2 ethyl 1,3 propanediol, etc. Because of its effectiveness, availability and cost, the THAM is particularly preferred. It is to be noted that other amino alcohols such as ethanolamtne, propanolamine and butanolamine which lack the 2,2 disubstitution, donor afford the oxazoline product. The requisite Mn ranges of these products have already been specified. The formation of the preferred oxazoline dispersants in high yield, can be effected by adding about 1.0 to obtain the monooxazoline to about 2 to obtain the bisoxazoline mole equivalent of the aforesaid 2,2 disub stituted 2 amino I alkanol per mole equivalent of the dicarboxylic acid material, with or without an inert diluent, and heating the mixture at 140 240 C., preferably l60 2050C., optimally 170 190 C. for 5 to 24, more usually 2 to 8 hours, until the reaction is complete. Completion of the oxazoline reaction can be readily ascertained by using periodic infrared spectral analysis for following oxazoline formation oxazoline peak forms at 6.0 microns , or by the cessation of water evolution of about 1,5 to 3.0 moles of water. Although not necessary, the presence of small amounts, such as O.Ol to 2 wt. , preferably 0.1 to 1 wt. based on the weight of the reactants, of a metal salt e.g. zinc acetate can be used in the reaction mixture as a catalyst. Inert solvents which may be used in the oxazoline reaction include hydrocarbon oils, e.g., mineral lubricating oil, kerosene, neutral mineral oils, xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. carbon tetrachioride, dichlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, etc. Such solvents can be used in molybdation condensation or complexing reaction with said oxazoline dispersant. While not known with complete certainty, it is believed that the reaction of the hydrocarbyl substituted dicarboxylic acid material, e.g., a substituted succinic anhydride with the amino alcohol of the invention, e.g., about 1.5 to 2 equivalents of 2,2 disubstituted 2 aminomethanol such as tris hydroxymethylaminomethane THAM , gives oxazoline, e.g. a mixture of monoxazoline and bisoxazoline to all bisoxazoline via the intermediacy of several discrete reaction species such as a hemi ester and an amic acid amine salt which upon heating goes to the final bisoxazoline product. Generally, useful lactone oxazoline reaction products and their methods of preparation are fully described in United States Patent 4,062,786. This lactone oxazoline dispersant can be characterized in part as a reaction product obtained from heating together an equimolar mixture of a hetero or non hetero hydrocarbonsubstituted lactone acid material selected from the group consisting of acids, amides and esters, and a 2,2 disubstituted 2 amino 1 alkanol having 1 to 3 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 4 to 3 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 4 to 8 carbons at a temperature of from 100 240 C. until infrared absorption for oxazoline is maximal indicating completion of the oxazoline reaction.These reaction products can be represented in part by the formula EMI9.1 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 400 or more carbons, X is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl or hydroxy alkyl group and at least one of the X substituents and preferably both of the X substituents being a hydroxy alkyl group of the structure CH2 noH where n is 1 to 3 and Y is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, sulfo, alkylthio TS , alkyldithio TSS , and a sulfur bridge, e.g.1 S and S S , joining two lactone oxazsrme units together as depicted below wherein z is a number ranging from 1 to 4 and T is defined hereafter as containing 1 to 50, preferably 2 to 20 carbons.EMI10.1 Preferred herein is polyisobutyl lactone oxazoline of number average molecular weight ranging from about 400 to 100,000 prepared by the reaction of equimolar proportions of polyisobutyl lactone carboxylic acid with tris hydroxy methyl aminomethane THAM at a temperature from about 100 240 C. preferably l500 1800C. until two moles of H20 per mole of reactant is removed from the reaction. The lactone oxazoline dispersants are readily prepared by lactonization of an alkenyl succinic acid analogue obtained via the Ene reaction of an olefin with an alpha beta unsaturated C4 to C10 dicarboxylic acid, or anhydrides or esters thereof, such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, dimethyl fumarate, etc. These hydrocarbon soluble dispersants have at least 8 carbons in the substantially saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl group and a carboxylic acid group of the dicarboxylic acid material converted into a lactone ring and another carboxylic acid group converted into an oxazoline ring as a result of the reaction of at least equimolar amounts of said hydrocarbon substituted dicarboxylic acid lactone material and a 2,2 disubstituted 2amino l alkanol having 1 to 3 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 4 to 8 carbons, said amino alkanol preferably having the formula EMI11.1 wherein X is alkyl or hydroxy alkyl, said alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and at least one of said X is a hydroxy alkyl group of the structure CH2 n0H where n is 1 to 3. Since it is possible to use alkenyl substituents with the double bond in the 1, 2, or 3 position or even double bonds further out on the hydrocarbyl chain and the size of the lactone ring formed will depend upon, inter alia, the position of the double bond, and which carboxylic acid group participates in the lactone forming reaction, both 5 and 6 ring or larger ring lactones are produced and can be used in this invention. The lactone oxazoline dispersant reagent can include the presence of certain heteroatoms adjacent to the lactone oxazoline ring combination to provide the lactone oxazoline system with other desirable properties such as antioxidation and anticorrosion activity. It is possible to introduce hydroxyl, thiyl, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone and sulfo groups adjacent to the lactone oxazoline functions by a the addition of peracids, hydrocarbyl peroxides or aqueous hydrogen peroxide to alkenyl succinic acid, hemiester or amide reagents or b the epoxidation of alkenyl succinic anhydride, with peracids gives epoxy anhydrides which can react with 1 water, alcohols or amines to generate the desired hydroxy substituted lactone reactants or 2 directly with THAM to give the lactone oxazol ine end products, or c thiyl substituted lactones prepared via 1 thiol induced scission of epoxy anhydrides or via 2 sulfenyl halide addition to the double bond in alkenyl succinic acids or esters followed by lactonization via an internal displacement of halide. Oxidation of the mono thio bis lactones with peroxides can yield both sulfoxides and sulfones. In the case of the dithio bis lactones, oxidation affords sulfo containing lactones. Typical of a hetero substituted lactone oxazoline is mono or dithio bis polyisobutyl lactone acid . The amino alcohol used to react with the lactone to provide the oxazoline ring is a 2,2 disubstituted 2amino l alkanol containing a total of 4 to 8 carbon atoms as was earlier discussed To further enhance the dispersancy of oxazoline dispersants, the said dispersant, e.g the alkenyl succinic bisoxazoline, is readily borated by treating said oxazoline dispersant with a boron compound selected from the class consisting of boron oxide, boron halides, boron acids and esters of boron acids in a molar ratio of 1 1 to 1 2 of oxazoline dispersant to boron compound. Similarly, the alkyl lactone oxazoline can be borated in the same manner. The resulting borated dispersants can then be molybdated in accordance with this invention. The boration of the oxazoline or lactone oxazoline dispersants is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,116,876. boating is readily carried by adding from about 1 to 3 wt. based on the weight of said oxazoline compound of said boron compound, preferably boric acid which is most usually added as a slurry to said oxazoline dispersant and heating with stirring and at from about L35 C. to 165 C. from 1 to 5 hours followed by nitrogen stripping at said temperature ranges and filtration if desired. In case of the lactone derivative, the temperature should be 600 to 200 C. The resulting borated oxazolines contain from about 0.1 to 2.0, preferably 0.2 to 0.8, wt. boron based on the total weight of the borated oxazoline compound. The boron, which appears to be in the reactant dispersant as dehydrated boric acid polymers primarily CkB02 3 , attaches chemically to the dispersant imides and diimides as amine salts e.g. the metaborate salt of said diimide and appears not displaced in the molybdenumization step. Oxazoline formation from the dicarboxylic acid material is usefully carried as a solution reaction with the dicarboxylic acid material, e.g. polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride dissolved in a solvent such as mineral oil to which the other reactant is added. The formation of the oxazoline dispersants in high yield can be effected by adding from about 1 to 2, preferably about 1.5 to 2.0, molar proportions of said amino alkanol per molar proportion of dicarboxylic acid and thereafter heating the system within the appropriate temperature range until the appropriate amount of water of reaction is evolved. In the case of the lactone modification, about 1 to 1.5 molar proportions of said amino alcohol are reacted with 1 molar proportion of said lactone acid. Typically the solvent mineral oil is adjusted so that it constitutes 50 weight of the final oxazoline dispersant solution.This solution can be readily sued for boration as described. The source of molybdenum is a molybdenum oxygen or sulfur containing compound capable of complexing with the ashless dispersant to provide a thermally stable molybdenum complex containing from about 0.5 to 20, preferably 2 to 10, optimally about 5 wt. molybdenum based on the total weight of said complex. The sources of molybdenum include molybdic trioxide preferred also known as molybdic anhydride, ammonium thiomolybdate, ammonium bismolybdate, molybdenum halides, and ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate. The molybdenum oxazoline complex is substantially the product of a binary solution reaction between 1 3 moles of oxazoline dispersant either the borated or non borated and 1 mole of molybdenum metal derived from the molybdenum source. The reaction is readily carried out by reaction at an elevated temperature of from 40 C.to 250 C., preferably 5000. to 2000C. optimally 6000. to 180004 The reaction is carried out in a binary solution system wherein water is present either as water or ammonium hydroxide along with a non aqueous component such as tetrahydrofuran THF or a hydrocarbon boiling between 700 C. and 2500C. and as preferred a second non aqueous component which is a higher boiling point hydrocarbon as mineral oil A highly useful reaction system is 1 to 20 water, ammonium hydroxide and mixtures thereof, 20 to 60 mineral oil and the balance xylene, toluene or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is carried out over a period of from about 4 to 20, preferably 6 to 12, hours in order to suitably stabilize the complex after which the binary solvents are generally removed and the complex dissolved in mineral oil for ease ofhandling. Carrying out the organo molybdenum complexing reaction in a binary solvent system of one part by weight water or ammonium hydroxide per 1 to 1000 parts by weight of THF or said lower boiling hydrocarbon provides a number of benefits over a reaction without solvent or in a light aromatic solvent such as toluene or a light hydrocarbon oil, e.g. mineral oil including faster reaction time completion of reaction to a stabilized molybdenum complex at a lower temperature and, an additive. product solution which when added to lubricating oil provides both enhanced friction reduction and sludge dispersancy. The hydrocarbon soluble.molybdenum complexes of oxazoline dispersants provide not only dispersancy for lubricating oils but enhanced lubricity as well as when used in combination with an active sulfur donor which can be defined as a compound which when used in admixture with the dispersant molybdenum complex reduces the coefficient of friction at least about 10 relative to that provided by the complex alone. The active sulfur donor is present in an amount of from about 0.1 to 10, preferably 0.2 to 2, parts by weight per part by weight of molybdenum complex. Illustrative of active sulfur donors are metal dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates and the corresponding precursor esters, phosphosulfurized pinenes, sulfurized olefins and hydrocarbons, sulfurized fatty esters and sulfurized alkyl phenols. Preferred are the zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates which are salts of dihydrocarbyl esters of dithiophosphoric acids and may be represented by the following formula EMI15.1 wherein R and R may be the same or different hydrocarbyl radicals containing from 1 to 18 and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms and including radicals such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl and cycloaliphatic radicals. Particularly preferred as R and R groups are alkyl groups of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Thus, the radicals may, for example, be ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, i butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, amyl n hexyl, i hexyl, n heptyl, n octyl decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, 2 ethylhexyl, phenyl, butylphenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl, propenyl, butenyl, etc.In order to obtain oil solubility, the total number of carbon atoms in the dithiophosphoric acid will average about 5 or greater. The zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates which are useful as the coadditive, i.e. sulfur donor of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with known techniques by first esterifying a dithiophosphoric acid usually by reaction of an alcohol or phenol with P2S5 and then neutralizing the dithiophosphoric acid ester with a suitable zinc compound such as zinc oxide. In general, the zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate will be used in the lubricating composition at a concentration within the range of about 0.01 to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts of lubricating oil and preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5. This is adequate for sulfur donation whereby the lubricity enhancement of the lubricating oil composition by the coadditive combination is realized. Equally suitable active sulfur donors are the dihydrocarbyl esters of dithiophosphoric acid particularly, the dibutylphenyl dithiophosphate. The phosphorosulfurized terpenes, as represented by pinene, dipentene, allo ocimene, etc., are another group of dithiophosphate diesters which are active sulfur donors.Of the terpenes, the bicyclic pinene is preferred. The phosphosulfurized terpene is readily obtained by reaction of about one mole of diester of thiophosphoric acid and one mole of pinene at a temperature of at least 100or., e.g. 100 C. to 2000 C. The preferred active sulfur donor can be characterized as the bornyl ester of dihydrocarbyl C2 C20 dithiophosphoric acids as shown in U.S. 2,689,258 . The sulfurized olefins and hydrocarbons are further esters of tiliophosphoric acids which are useful sulfur donors. These esters are achieved by reaction with olefines such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, decene, dodecene, octadecene, etc., olefin polymers of molecular weight ranging from 100 to 50,000 such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, etc., aromatics such as benzene, naphthylene, toluene, xylene, etc., petroleum fractions and condensation products of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons with aromatic compounds, e.g. wax naphthalene see U.S. 2,804,431 . The sulfurized fatty esters are another subclass of esters which are active sulfur donors. These products are readily obtained from the reaction of P2Ss and aliphatic alcohols usefully having from about 8 to 22 carbons obtained from natural sources including linoleic, palmolitic, behenic, stearic, palmitic, lauric, capric, etc., as well as mixtures obtained from vegetable and animal oils, such as tall oil. The sulfurized alkyl phenols are generally C4 toC20 alkyl phenol sulfides. These sulfurized alkyl phenols are readily produced by sulfurizing an alkyl phenol with a sulfur halide or elemental sulfur. In addition to the molybdenum complex of the oxazoline dispersant and active sulfur donor, the lubricating oil composition may contain other well known lubricating oil additives to provide trouble free operation of the lubricated equipment, such as ashless dispersants, metallic detergents, supplemental oxidation and corrosion inhibitors, extreme pressure agents, rust inhibitors, pour point depressants, viscosity index improvers, etc. As used herein, the terminology ashless dispersant in describing both the reactant and the additive is intended to describe the now well known class of non metalcontaining oil soluble polymeric additives or the acyl derivatives of relatively high molecular weight carboxylic acids which are capable of dispersing contaminants and the like in hydrocarbons such as lubricating oils. The carboxylic acids may be mono or polycarboxylic acids and they are generally characterized by substantially hydrocarbon constituents containing an average of 50 to 250 aliphatic carbon atoms. A preferred class of ashless dispersants are the nitrogen containing dispersant additives. These dispersants include mineral oil soluble salts, amides, imides and esters made from high molecular weight mono and dicarboxylic acids and where they exist the corresponding acid anhydrides and various amines of nitrogen containing materials having amino nitrogen or heterocyclic nitrogen and at least one amino or hydroxy group capable of salt, amide, imide or ester formation. Usually, these dispersants are made by condensing a monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid or anhydride, preferably a succinic acid producing material such as alkenyl succinic anhydride, with an amine or alkylene polyamine. Usually, the molar ratio of acid or anhydride to amine is between 1 1 to 5 1, e.g. 1 mole of C10 C100 polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride to 2 moles of tetraethylene pentamine. Primarily because of its ready availability and low cost, the hydrocarbon portion of the mono , or dicarboxylic acid or anhydride is preferably derived from a polymer of a C2 to Cs monoolefin, said polymer generally having between 50 and 250 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred polymer is polyisobutylene. Polyalkyleneamines are usually used to make the non metal containing dispersant. These polyalkyleneamines include those represented by the general formula NH2 CH2 n NH CH2 ngm NH2 wherein n is 2 to 3 and m is a number from 0 to 10. Specific compounds coming within the formula include diethylenetriamine, tetraethylenepentamine, dipropylenetriamine, octaethyleneonamine, and tetrapropylenepentamine N,N di 2 aminoethyl ethylenediamine may also be used. Other aliphatic polyamino compounds that may be used are N aminoalkylpiperazines, e.g. N 2 aminoethyl piperazine. Mixtures of alkylene polyamines approximating tetraethylene pentamine are commercially available, e.g. Dow E lOO sold by Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Michigan. Representative dispersants are formed by reacting about one molar amount of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride with from about one to about two molar amounts of tetraethylene pentamine or with from about 0.5 to 1 moles of a polyol, e.g. pentaerythritol. It is possible to modify the ashless dispersants generally by the addition of metals such as boron in order to enhance the dispersancy of the additive. This is readily accomplished by adding boric acid to the reaction mixture after the imidation or esterification is substantially complete and heating the mixture at temperatures of 100 to 1500C. for a few hours. Detergents useful in conjunction with dispersants, preferably the ashless type, include normal, basic or over based metal, e.g. calcium, magnesium, etc., salts of petroleum naphthenic acids, petroleum sulfonic acids, alkyl ben zene sulfonic acids, oil soluble fatty acids, alkyl salicyclic acids, alkylene bis phenols, and hydrolyzed phosphorosulfurized polyolefins. Oxidation inhibitors include hindered phenols, e.g. 2,6 ditert butyl para cresol, amines, sulfurized phenols and alkyl phenothiazines. Pour point depressants include wax alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, olefin polymers and copolymers, acrylate and methacrylate polymers and copolymers. Viscosity Index improvers include olefin polymers such as polybutene, ethylene propylene copolymers, hydrogenated polymers and copolymers and terpolymers of styrene with isoprene and or butadiene, polymers of alkyl acrylates or alkyl methacrylates, copolymers of alkyl methacrylates with N vinyl pyrollidone or dimethylaminoalkyl methacrylate, post grated polymers of ethylene propylene with an active monomer such as maleic anhydride which may be further reacted with an alcohol or an alkylene polyamine, styrene maleic anhydride polymers post reacted with alcohols and amines, etc. The hydrocarbons in which the additive combination of the invention is most effective are mineral oils having a viscosity as measured by ASTM D 445 of from about 2 to 40, preferably 5 to 20 centistokes at 99 C. If the molybdenum containing oxazoline dispersant is used as an additive concentrate, the concentrate may consist essentially of from about 5 to 80 weight percent of molybdenum containing dispersant, based on the total weight of said concentrate, the remainder being a suitable solvent such as kerosene, mineral oil, synthetic oil and a naphtha or the like. The preferred concentrate contains aboutL0 60 weight percent of the additive combination in the solvent. Whether the molybdenized oxazoline dispersant is used alone or in combination with other additives, its concentration may vary appreciably with the particular application. For example, when the said molybdenum containing dispersants are used alone in a fuel such as gasoline, the concentration of the additive ranges from 1 to 1000, preferably 5 50 parts per million, based on the total weight of the gasoline. In a lubricant, however, it is used from about 0.1 to 20, preferably 0.5 5 based on the total weight of the oil. Products containing at least one oxazoline ring can be used as antirust agents, detergents, or dispersants for oleaginous compositions including lube oil, gasoline, turbine oils and oils for drilling applications. The following Examples illustrate more clearly the compositions of the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of 40 grams of a 50 wt. mineral oil solution of a bisoxazoline dispersant obtained from the reaction of one mole of polyisobutenyl Mn of about 1300 succinic anhydride with about two moles of tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane THAM to provide the bisoxazoline of polysiobutenyl succinic anhydride3, 2.87 grams of molybdic oxide MoO3 H2O , 50 cc of toluene and 5 cc of water were refluxed with stirring for 7.25 hours. During this time, water and xylene were removed by distillation. The reactants were freed from solid material by filtration and the filtrate stripped of volatile material by rotoevaporation. The product was a dark brown oil containing 3.56 molybdenum.This represents a conversion, based on molybdenum, of 79 on theory.EXAMPLE 2 The molybdated dispersant of Example 1 was evaluated in a formulated oil, for its effect on friction in aRoxana Four Ball Tester. As a comparative example, an oil containing the dispersant but without molybdenum was run.The concentration of the molybdenum containing dispersant was adjusted to provide 0.1 molybdenum in the oil. A total dispersant concentration of 2.5 was maintained in all tests. The lubricant composition was Component Wt. 76 Active Ingredient Dispersant 2.5 Magnesium Sulfonate 0.4 overbased Zinc Dinonyl Phenoxy 1.0 Dithiophosphate Mineral Oil 96.1 The Roxana Four Ball wear tester with the Brown GE modification from Roxana Machine Works, St. Louis, MO was used to measure friction properties by the following procedure. The tester was assembled in the normal wear procedure as described in ASTM D 2266 67 using four bearing steel balls. The tester was brought to llO C. and run at 1200 rpm and 15 kg for a minimum of 45 minutes. If the frictional force as seen on the strip chart recorder is constant for the last 10 minutes, the speed is reduced to 25 rpm. Otherwise, the test is carried on until frictional force has stabilized.The test at 25 rpm is carried out at 1100C. and 15 kg for 15 minutes or until frictional force has stabilized. The compound of the invention was evaluated by subjecting the product of Example 1 to a study of its utility as a lubricity enhancing and or antiwear additive for lubricating oils by using said Testing Procedure. The results of tests under said Testing ProcedureA are set forth in the Table.EXAMPLE 3 224 grams of a 50 wt. mineral oil solution of a polyisobutyl lactone oxazoline having a of 1120 0.05 mole , 8.1 grams of MoO3 H2O 0.05 moles and 10 cc of water were stirred and refluxed ca. 140 C. in 200 cc of xylene for 4 hours. During this time, water and xylene were removed by distillation. The reactants were freed from solid material by filtration and the filtrate stripped of volatile material by rotoevaporation. The product was a 50 wt. mineral oil solution of a dark brown oil containing 0.886 wt. molybdenum. From the foregoing, it is shown that the molybdenum containing dispersant additives of the invention provide lubricity enhancement to lubricating oils superior to their non molybdized counterparts when an active sulfur donor is present and that they have utility as additives for lubricating oils providing both sludge dispersancy and lubricity enhancement.
