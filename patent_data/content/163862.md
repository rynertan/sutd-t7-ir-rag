# Magnetic head with stray flux compensation.

## Abstract
A magnetic disc apparatus includes a read and write head 1 having a read and write coil 6 , an erase head 7 at opposite sides of the read and write head 1 for erasing data at the opposite sides of the read and write head 1 and having an erase coil 9 , and a leakage magnetic flux can celling coil 21 wound on the read and write head 1 and being energized with a d.c. current for cancelling the leak age magnetic flux from the erase head 7 when the erase coil 9 is energized with a d.c. current.
