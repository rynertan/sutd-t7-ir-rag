# Semiconductor device having a resistor region with an enhanced breakdown voltage.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising in a semiconductor region 15 of one conductivity type a resistor region 10 of opposite conductivity type having at least one convex, i.e. outwardly projecting corner i o , is for the purpose of improving the breakdown voltage, particularly in a high voltage IC, provided with at least one additional region 31 34 having the same conductivity type as said resistor region 10 and being juxtaposed to the or a respective convex corner at a distance that a space charge region expanding from said resistor region may reach said addition al region preferably before avalanche breakdown occurs. The or each additional region may be formed simultaneously with said resistor region and may form a concave corner facing said convex corner.
