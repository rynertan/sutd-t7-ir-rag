# Molded case circuit breaker with a movable electrical contact positioned by a camming spring loaded clip.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker includes a movable contact having a base with a cam surface for engaging an outwardly projecting cam surface of a spring loaded clip disposed in a rotatable cross bar of an operating mechanism. One compression spring is retained between the cross bar and the spring clip. The spring clip is adapted to transfer biasing force to the base portion of the movable contact. Upon the occurrence of a short circuit, the upper contact arm rotates and the cam sur face is moved against the spring clip cam surface. The outward ly projecting surface of the spring clip and the arcuate cam sur face of the base portion are to provide decreased biasing force as the upper electrical contact rotates to its BLOWN OPEN position. A detent is formed along the arcuate cam surface of the base portion.
