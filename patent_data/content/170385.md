# Nylon based composition of matter, plastics films comprising a layer of same, and packages made from such plastics films.

## Abstract
The nylon based composition is a blend or copolymer of nylon 6 and another nylon, e.g. nylon 66 or nylon 12, the latter being 2.5 to 10 mole percent of the overall composi tion. The blend can be 40 to 70 weight percet nylon 6 and 60 to 25 weight percent of a nylon copolymer which consists of 80 to 90 nylon 6 and 20 to 10 of the other nylon. A packaging film, 10 can have a first layer 18 of the said composition, a second layer 12 of a heat sealable polymer such as low density polyethylene, a third, gas barrier layer 16 e.g. of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer and a fourth layer 14 between the second and third layers, the latter layer for instance being an ethylenic polymer or copolymer. The packaging film can be used for packaging moist products such as meat.
