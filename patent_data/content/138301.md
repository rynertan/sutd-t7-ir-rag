# High voltage power supply.

## Abstract
A 12 volt input 10 is supplied to a timer 12 providing a square wave output with an approximately 50 duty cycle. The output is applied to the base of a pair of transistors 20, 22 and the collectors of the transistors conduct when a drive motor is in either the forward direction or the reverse direction. During the time that a particular transistor is con ducting, its collector current rises to a point of cut off. At this time energy stored in a transformer circuit is released to the secondary 36 of the transformer circuit. To regulate the increase in voltage in the secondary, diode clamping is ac complished by a common string of Zener diodes 40 46 connected to the outlet of the secondaries of the transformer circuits and to the emitters of the transistors. By adding ad ditional Zener diodes in the secondary circuits of either of the transformer circuits, a change in the high voltage output for that particular transformer is accomplished.
