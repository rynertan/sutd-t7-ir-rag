# SAMPLING RATE CONVERTER FOR DELTA MODULATED SIGNALS

## Abstract
In the conversion of a first delta modulated signal with a first bit rate into a second delta modulated signal with a second bit rate, first and second digital signals derived from the first and second delta modulated signals respectively are compared in an adding circuit 58 , which is followed by a digital integration circuit 55 and a 1 bit quantizer 57 providing the second delta modulated signal. In this way an analog intermediary signal can be avoided and the circuit complexity is small. In another embodiment, using an analog intemediary signal, the adding circuit is followed by an analog integrator, an analog comparator and a sample and hold circuit providing the second delta modulated signal. In a third embodiment the first and second digital signals are PCM signals derived by digital integration of the first and second delta modulated signals, with sampling frequency conversion to match the PCM sampling frequencies.
