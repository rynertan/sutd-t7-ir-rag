# Method of controlling the speed of a drill, hammer drill, or rotary hammer and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a method of controlling the speed of an electronically controlled drill, hammer drill or rotary hammer driven by an electrical motor wherein the rotational speed is first raised from zero to a predetermined start drill speed and thereafter, from the start drill speed up to the working speed. The rotational speed is held automatically at the start drill speed for a predetermined time interval. The apparatus of the invention for carrying out the above method is an electronic control circuit connected to the motor for adjusting the start drill speed and the working speed. The electronic control circuit includes a control unit 30 for inter rupting the ascent of the rotational speed for a predetermined interval when the start drill speed is reached.
