## Description
PREPARATION OF THIOPHENES This invention relates to the preparation of certain thiophenes which are useful in the preparation of azo dyes. This invention is a process for the preparation of thiophenes having the formulaEMI1.1 which comprises reacting an enamine having the formulaEMI1.2 with a ketone having the formulaEMI1.3 III wherein R1 is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical R is hydrogen, an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical, or an acyl group i.e. a residue of an acid , such as alkoxycarbony carboxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, N alkylcarbamoyl, N,N dialkylcarbamoyl,N arylcarbamoyl, alkanoyl, aroyl, piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, sulfamoyl, N alkylsulfamoyl,N,N dialkylsulfamoyl, N arylsulfamoyl, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, piperidinosulfonyl, morpholinosulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, piperidinosulfinyl or morpholinosulfinyl R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical R R4 is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or a heterocyclic arylnradical containing 5 or 6 ring members R5 and R6 are alkyl radicals or togetherR5 and R6 are tetramethylene, pentamethylene or 3 oxapentamethylene and X is chloro or bromo. The process can be carried out in an inert, organic solvent st a temperature in the range of 15 to 200 C., preferably 20 to 80 C. to give thiophenes I in good to excellent yields. Thiophenes I can be converted to the corresponding 2 aminothiophenes by using relatively mild conditions which, under certain conditions, do not affect other sensitive groups present on the thiophene compound. Rajappa et al, Indian J.Chem., 12 1974 1 3, disclose that a good yield of thiophene V was obtained by the following reaction EMI2.1 In attempts to prepare thiophenes I by the reaction discl osed by Rajappa et al using an enamine containing a primary amino group, i.e., enamine II wherein both R5 and R6 are hydrogen, the predominant product was found to be pyrimidines rather than the desired thiophenes. Thus, in preparing thiophenes I containing the NH wR1 group rather than a NHiR group, it is essential that the enamine contain a tertiary amine as is present in enamines 11 . The alkyl groups represented by R1, R2, R3 and R4 and the alkyl moieties of the other 2 groups represented by R can contain up to 18 carbon atoms, preferably up to 4 carbon atoms referred to herein as lower . The alkyl groups can be substituted with various substituents which do not affect the course of the process, i.e., those that do not react with either II or III .Examples of such substituents include hydroxy, lower alkoxy, cyano, nitro, succinimido, glutarimido, phthalimido, cyclohexyl, fluorenyl, aryl, fluorosulfonyl and groups having the formula NH Y R7, Y R7, OCOO R7, CONR8R9 and S02NR8R9 wherein R8 is hydrogen, alkyl, 9 cycloalkyl, or aryl and R is hydrogen or alkyl, Y is CO, COO , or SO2 and R7 is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl or when Y is CO , R7 also can be amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, or furyl. The alkyl gruops represented by R7 preferably are unsubstituted lower alkyl or lower alkyl substituted, for example, with halogen, aryl, cyano, lower alkylsulfonyl, hydroxy, lower alkylthio, lower alkanoyloxy, etc. The carbocyclic aryl groups represented byR1, R2, R3 and R4 can contain up to 18 carbon atoms and can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with alkyl or the substituents which can be present on the alkyl groups represented by R1,R2, R3 and R4. Examples of such aryl groups include unsubstituted and substituted phenyl and naphthyl. The heterocyclic aryl groups which R4 can represent contain 5 or 6 ring members, are stabilized by resonance and can be unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl or with one or more of the substituents which can be present on the above described alkyl radicals. Examples of the heterocyclic aryl groups include pyridyl, quinolyl, oxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzimidazolyl, oxadiazolyl, the thiadiazolyls, thienyl, pyrimidinyl and pyrazinyl. The process is especially useful in preparing thiophenes of formula I from enamines wherein R2 is an alkoxycarbonyl group having the formula COO R10 wherein R10 is a carboxylprotecting group, i.e., a group which in conjunction with COO forms an ester from which a carboxyl group can be generated. Examples of such groups are set forth in Chapter 5 of Balsam, Protective Groups inOrganic Chemistry, Plenum Press 1973 .The preferred groups represented by R10 are lower alkyl such as l,l dimethylethyl 2 cyanoethyl 2,2,2trichloroethyl arylmethyl such as benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, and pentamethylbenzyl benzhydryl 2 arylsulfonylethyl such as 2 phenylsulfonylethyl 2 aroylethyl such as 2 benzoylethyl and phthalimidomethyl including substituted phthalimidomethyl such as 4 sulfamoyland 4 lower alkylsulfamoylphthalimidomethyl. Examples of inert organic solvents which can be employed in the process are ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and p dioxane, alcohols such as methanol, isopropanol, and butanol, ether alcohols such as 2 methoxyethanol and 2 2 methoxyethoxy ethanol, hydrocarbons such as hexane and toluene and pyridine compounds such as pyridine and the picolines. The process is particularly suitable for the preparation of thiophenes I by reacting enamines 11 with a ketone having the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R1 is lower alkyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 1, l dimethyl 2 , 2 , 2 trichloroethyl or phenyl R2 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, cyano, benzoyl or a group having the formula COO R10 wherein R10 is a carboxyl protecting group R3 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl R4 is lower alkyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl substituted with hydroxy, sulfamoyl, lower alkylsulfamoyl, sulfo, fluorosulfonyl, lower alkoxysulfonyl, carboxyl, lower alkylsulfonamido, arylsulfonamido, nitro, cyano, chloro, lower alkoxy or lower alkylsulfonyl and R5 and R6 each is lower alkyl.EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of 25 g .061 m of ethyl 2 2, 2, 2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl amino thioxomethyl 3 iethylamino propenoate, 17.15 g .061 m of m fluorosulfonylphenacyl bromide, and 125 ml isopropyl alcohol was heated to reflux for five minutes.
