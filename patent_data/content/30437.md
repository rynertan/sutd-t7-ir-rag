# Method and apparatus for compression and decompression of digital image data.

## Abstract
A digital image data compression system which gener ates run length symbols comprising a white and a black portion containing up to a specified maximum number of white pixels resp. black pixels. A symbol may be composed of a black por tion followed by a white portion or vice versa. If the second portion of any run length of a particular type run exceeds the maximum number of pixels, that run length is terminated at the maximum number, the corresponding symbol is generated, and a special symbol, indicating a change in the type of run, is inserted. The symbol following the special symbol, which is the opposite type from the original symbol, is generated using the remaining pixels from the last run length and the following run length of the opposite colour. The symbols are used to provide address data for memory devices 38, 40 which generate var iable length code words that are transmitted to a receiving sta tion 102 .
