A cooling means 10 for a furnace, particularly a blast furnace, is mounted to the furnace by means of a bellows 26 , the rear end of which is attached to a collar 24 surrounding one or more of the conduits 20 for cooling water and the front end 28 of which is adapted for attachment to the fur nace shell 32 or a member 30 rigid therewith. In this way the cooling element 10 is firmly and sealingly mounted in the furnace shell 32 , the bellows 26 allowing movement of the element with respect to the shell caused by settling of refrac tory material 34 in which the cooling element is located.
