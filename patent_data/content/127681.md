## Description
This invention is concerned with an IgA binding protein isolatable from the surface of a Group B streptococci, a product comprising said IgA binding protein absorbed on a solid support, a method of separating such IgA binding proteins and a method of detecting a pathogenic Neisseria meningitides or Neisseria gonorrhoeal infection. IgA, as is known, is an immunoglobulin or class of antibody which is related to immunity against infections with bacteria and viruses at mucosal surfaces. It is present in all mammalian secretions including milk, spinal fluid and vaginal washings. Like all human antibodies, IgA is comprised of heavy and light chains, and is characterized by a crystalline fraction, Fc, and an antibody fraction, Fab. There are two subclasses of IgA. These are IgA₁ and IgA₂. They differ in the structure of the heavy chains. Additionally, the antibodies exist in monomer form molecular weight about 160,000 , and dimer form in serum. Only the dimer form exists in mammalian secretions, and this is attached to an additional moiety known as the secretory piece. The IgA antibody, like all antibodies, is produced by the lymphocytes of the immune system. The secretory piece is produced by the epithelial cells lining the surface of body structures such as the breast, gut, salivary glands or genitourinary tract. The IgA produced by the lymphocytes is picked up by the epithelial cells from the side in contact with the circulating blood, the secretory piece is added, and the secretory IgA is secreted in the exterior surface of the epithelial cell. In the course of combating bacterial and viral infections, IgA participates in the neutralization of antigens by routes which are known and understood. Many clinical tests for the presence of infection have been devised and are widely utilized which depend upon recognition of an interaction between IgA and antigens generated by the infection. Group B streptococci is a class of microorganisms which has been extensively studied and classified. The publication of H. Russel et al. in The Journal of Immunology 109 1 , 90 96 1972 refers to the isolation and some physiochemical and biologic properties of the type III antigen of Group B streptococci. The subject matter of this publication is principally the concept of isolating antigens to use for raising antibodies, either for the detection of a disease or for potential utility as a vaccine. It is concerned with carbohydrate antigens. Furthermore from several publications it is known that many pathogenic bacteria, including certain Neisseria, Haemophilus and Streptococcus strains produce IgA proteases. However, there is no disclosure or any hint as to the presence of IgA binding proteins. On the contrary, no member of Group B streptococci has ever been known to bind to IgA. It has now been discovered that certain of these streptococci, generally of the 1b or 1c serotype, will bind to IgA. Moreover, procedures have been discovered for separating an IgA binding protein IgABP from the surface of group B streptococci where it occurs. One subject matter of this invention is a method of separating the IgA binding protein from the surface of a Group B streptococci which comprises extracting the streptococci in the log phase with an aqueous medium containing a material which will disrupt the bond between the cell surface and the protein to form a solution containing the protein and adding a protein precipitating reagent to precipitate the desired product. One such procedure is to heat the streptococci in dilute aqueous mineral acid at 50 C to 60 C for from 1.5 to 2.5 hours. The preferred acid is dilute hydrochloric acid, e.g., 0.15 to 0.25 M, but other dilute mineral acids may be employed. The preferred procedure is to heat for two hours at 56 C in 0.2 M hydrochloric acid. The solution is neutralized with dilute alkaline reagent, e.g., 0.2M sodium hydroxide. The desired product may be precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid or other reagent and then purified. Another method of separating the IgA binding protein from the surface of a Group B streptococci comprises As extraction medium preferably an aqueous puffer solution of 1 to 10 sodium dodecyl sulphate at pH 6 to 9 and as protein precipitation reagents preferably ethanol at 0 C to 10 C are used. An alternative procedure comprises According to this embodiment it is suitable to mix the streptococci in a dilute solution of the non ionic detergent for a period of from about 36 to 72 hours, preferably 40 to 50 hours. The protein is precipitated with a selected reagent such as ethanol. It may be further purified. The preferred procedure for isolating the IgABP of this invention is by boiling in an anionic detergent. Suitable non ionic detergents for use in this invention include Triton X 100 and Tween 20. Both are well known and available commercially. The former is a polyethylene glycol p isooctylphenyl ether. The latter is polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The presently preferred anionic detergent is the commercially available sodium dodecyl sulfate. Others are known and can be used. According to this embodiment the extraction medium may be an aqueous buffer solution of 1 to 10 polyethylene glycol p isobutylphenyl ether at pH 6 to 9 and the protein precipitation may be carried out using ethanol at 0 C to 10 C. The presently preferred procedure for isolating the IgABP of this invention using anionic detergent is as follows The bacteria were removed by centrifugation and the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 30 trichloroacetic acid. The pellet obtained by centrifugation was washed once with ethanol and once with acetone. The remaining pellet was suspended in 25 ml of the standard SDS PAGE boiling solution and subjected to electrophoresis in a 10 polyacrylamide slab gel. After staining with Coomassie brilliant blue and destaining the SDS PAGE pattern consisted predominantly of a single band with SDS PAGE mobility corresponding to a protein of 132,000 molecular weight. A number of other minor bands with molecular weights ranging from 40,000 to 132,000 were also apparent. A second preparation of the protein was also subjected to SDS PAGE followed by western blotting onto nitrocellulose strips. The strip was then soaked in 0.05 Tween 20 for 30 minutes, after which 1 x 10⁷ cpm of ¹²⁵I labelled IgA at a concentration of 4 mg ml was added to the strip for 4 hours. The strip was subsequently washed extensively with 0. 05 Tween 20 and used to expose photographic film. By this technique it could be shown that the major protein band seen in the SDS PAGE plus most of the minor proteins were also capable of binding the ¹²⁵I IgA and thereby exposing the photographic film. Molecular weight markers used in estimation of the molecular weight of the IgABP were as follows β galactosidase 136kD , human transferrin 80kD , Ovalbumin 45kD , Cytochrome C 12.5kD . SDS PAGE is a well known and widely used process for separating proteinaceous materials using Once the desired material is separated from the streptococcus substrate it may be isolated and purified as described herein. Alternatively, solutions of the products in relatively dilute or impure states can be utilized. Three procedures have thus far been described for isolating the useful products of this invention. In the last described process the product of the invention manifested a molecular weight of 132,000 on SDS PAGE electrophoresis. This is a characteristic of the IgABP products of this invention. When subjected to SDS PAGE electrophoresis the apparent molecular weight is 132,000. If the products described above as precipitated with trichloroacetic acid or ethanol were boiled in 2 SDS and then treated as in the preferred procedure, there would be other major and minor bands when they were subjected to SDS PAGE electrophoresis. These bands would be indicative of different molecular weights. However, they would be capable of binding IgA. It is apparent therefore that the products of this invention, i.e., the IgA binding proteins, are characterized by a fixed fraction which binds the protein and a variable fraction which may be of different lengths, but always is associated with the binding portion. It is similar to a series of arrows, all of different lengths, but all useful for the same purpose since the shafts of differing length all carry an arrow head. No IgA binding protein has ever been reported, much less isolated, from Group B streptococci. The salient features of the novel IgABP of this invention can be employed in two distinct solid phase systems. In one such system the binding protein is absorbed on a solid phase support as in column chromatography. The second major application is to bind the IgABP to an absorbing surface such as a plastic plate, more specifically, a test well, and for use in a class of assays commonly known as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA. The utilities for the first type of support are The application for the second type of support plastic plate are Those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains, once they have understood the procedures for isolating and identifying the IgABP of this invention as described herein, will readily understand how the products can be utilized in each of the procedures described above. They will, of course, recognize that it is not essential to isolate and purify the IgABP in order to practice the various embodiments of the invention. In fact, it will almost always be most convenient to utilize compositions containing the binding protein at various concentrations, for example the effluent from a chromatographic column containing the binding protein in solution. One such solution can be prepared by the following procedure. A suspension of Group B streptococci is first tested to be certain that it will bind to IgA. This may be determined by incubating a pellet of streptococci with radiolabelled IgA at room temperature for about 20 minutes and then testing by conventional procedures for the presence of conjugated IgA. Specific known strains of Group B streptococci which are known and publically available and may be employed in the practice of this invention are A 909, F 345 3 and H 36B 5. The first two strains are 1c serotype. The last strain is 1b serotype. A suspension of the selected strain in the log phase is extracted by boiling in 1 to 10 aqueous sodium decyl sulfate for 10 minutes to two hours at a pH of from about 6 to 9. The pH is not critical, but it is convenient to maintain it in this range with a suitable buffer such as 0.1M Tris HC1. The bacteria are separated, for example by centrifugation. The protein remains in solution and may be precipitated by conventional procedures, including for example the addition of ammonium sulfate, ethanol, or other protein precipitating reagent. It is most convenient to effect precipitation by the addition of ethanol at a temperature of about 0 C to 10 C to provide a mixture which is 60 to 90 , preferably 65 to 75 in ethanol. The precipitated material is resuspended in water at a pH of from about 5.5 to 6.5 maintained by a suitable buffer such as glycine hydrochloric acid, sodium acetate acetic acid, or a citrate buffer. A 10 mM citrate buffer at pH 5.5 is most convenient. To remove the contaminating DNA or RNA, both of which are negatively charged, at this pH, the solution is passed over a DEAE Sepharose column which has been equilibrated with the same buffer employed in solubilizing the precipitate. The absorbent is positively charged and readily binds the DNA and RNA. The effluent from the column contains the binding protein in solution in sufficient concentration to be useful for the various purposes outlined above. DEAE Sepharose is available from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals. It is a bead formed gel formed from agarose and converted to the diethylamino ethyl DEAE derivative. Other cationic exchange resins can be used. As a further aid towards understanding this invention, the procedure for detecting a Neisseria gonorrhea or meningitides infection will now be described in more detail. A constitutive extracellular enzyme, IgA₁ protease is released from the pathogenic In this assay, the IgABP bound to an ELISA plate is used to bind the Fc portion of IgA. The IgA₁ protease can then cleave the IgA and release the Fab fragments which contain L chains. The presence or absence of the light chains corresponding to the absence or presence of the enzyme can then be detected using a suitable reagent. The assay is as follows IgA₁ protease negative wells still contain intact IgA and so give a yellow color on reaction with the substrate. IgA₁ protease positive wells do not contain intact IgA, and so do not give a color reaction on addition of the substrate. Brij 35 is a non ionic detergent comprising polyoxyethylene ethers of fatty acids. It is used to protect the absorbing surface from non specific absorption of extraneous proteins. The magnesium chloride is not essential but is preferred, especially if phosphate buffers are employed, since the IgA₁ protease requires trace amounts of magnesium ions for optimum activity. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that at each step of the procedure variations can be made in such parameters as concentration, temperature and incubation time without adversely affecting the test. Equivalent buffers may be employed.
