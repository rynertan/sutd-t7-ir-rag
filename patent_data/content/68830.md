# Substrate carrying a porous polymeric material.

## Abstract
An article suitable for delivering or absorbing liquid in cludes a substrate carrying a pressure sensitive porous po lymeric material which is capable of retaining at least 10 times its own weight of water or corrersponding amounts of other li quids. The porous polymeric material is advantageously a crosslinked homogeneous block material having a dry density of less than 0.1 g cc and a pore volume of more than 9 cc g, and may be produced by polymerisation of a high internal phase emulsion. In the article of the invention, the polymer may either be dry or contain an included liquid the dry form is high ly absorbent and is useful for mopping up spillages, while the liquid containing form is useful for delivering treatment liquids, for example, cleaning compositions, to surfaces. The article may take the form of a single or multi compartment sachet of paper or nonwoven fabric containing the porous polymeric ma terial.
