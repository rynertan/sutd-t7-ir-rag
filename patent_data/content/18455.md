# Apparatus for supplying high power electric loads operated in a pulse like manner, and method for carrying out fluoroscopy.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for supplying high power electric loads operated in a pulse like manner, particularly to X ray equipment. The apparatus makes use of the mechanical energy of rotation of a flywheel 4 rotated through a time period which is substantially longer than the pulse duration of the load by a driving power substantially smaller than the pulse power of the load to generate a supply voltage for the load in expense of this mechanical energy. The driving period of the flywheel 4 and the associated driving power provide an energy bal ance with the short pulses with high power consumption. The apparatus comprises a generator unit 2 with at least one electric rotary machine which has a rotor which rotates together with the flywheel 4 . The excitation of the rotary machine is provided by a field power supply 10 controlled by a control unit 100 . The control unit 100 controls the excita tion of the generator unit 2 to provide predetermined output voltage and current levels for the load. The apparatus according to the invention can provide a specified operation control for the load. According to an aspect of the invention a method has been provided for carrying out fluorography which can see to an increased sensed light intensity. According to this method fluoroscopy is carried out by pulsed X ray irradiation with low average intensity and high pulse intensity, in which the repeti tion frequency of the pulse is high enough to provide for a continuous light sensation. Such pulsed irradiation provides for an image on the fluoroscopic screen in which the sensed light intensity increased by the ratio of the peak and average radiation intensities compared to the light intensity of a con ventional continuous irradiation with the average intensity.
