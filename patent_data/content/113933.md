# Television transmission system.

## Abstract
A television transmission system for the simultaneous transmission of television signals from the same scene for standard and wide picture formats of respectively a standard aspect ratio and a wider than standard aspect ratio. The televi sion signal for the scene having 1249 lines per field is divided to produce a first television signal of 625 lines per field representing the wide picture format where adja cent lines of a field are derived from alternate lines of the scene television signal and a second television signal also of 625 lines per field representing the standard picture format where adjacent lines of a field are derived from the intervening lines of the scene television signal. The first and second television signals may be received together for the provision of a wide screen television display but the invention has the advantage that the second television signal may be received alone by currently manufactured televi sion receivers for reproduction of a display of standard aspect ratio.
