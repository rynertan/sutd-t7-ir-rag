# Automobile antenna system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a diversity type auto mobile antenna system comprising a pair of high frequency pickups mounted on the vehicle body at one or more locations whereat surface high frequency currents will be induced by radio or other waves with higher densities, said high frequency pickups 32,36 being arranged such that one of said high frequency pickups can complement the other with respect to sensitivity. The above locations on the vehicle body include the marginal edge of a closure such as trunk lid, roof or engine hood, and various connections between each adjacent vehicle portion of flat configuration such as pillars supporting the roof panel or trunk hinges. One of the high frequency pickups are adapted to be automatically selected such that it can receive radio or other waves more sensitively.
