# Socket terminal.

## Abstract
A socket terminal 10 comprises a stamped and formed elongate body 14 with an annular recess 26 and having a wire engaging portion 16 at a rear end and a pin receiving portion 22 comprising an annulus of resilient contact arms 24 at a mating end, a seamless sleeve 28 of corrosion resistant material receiving the contact arms 24 and having an inturned flange 30 at a mating end, a first annular crimp 34 in the sleeve 28 engaging the recess 26 to secure the sleeve 28 to the body 14 and a second annular crimp 36 engaging the contact arms 24 adjacent their root ends thereby to impart a predetermined prestress to the contact arms 24 with the free ends of the contact arms 24 spaced from the sleeve 28 so that they constitute cantilever beams.
