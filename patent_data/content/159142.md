# Digital filters.

## Abstract
A transversal finite impulse response, adaptive digital filter comprises three stages 10, 11, 12. The stage 10 is a memory stage which stores input samples x and coefficients. The stage 11 is an arithmetic stage which forms convolution products and accumulates the product to provide an output. The stage 12 forms update values for updating the coeffi cients according to a predetermined algorithm. The stages are coupled by buses 14, 15 and date transfer between the stages via the buses is controlled by a control unit 18. The filter operates so that convolution products are formed during a first part of each sample period and update values are formed during a second part of each sample period for use in the subsequent sample period.
