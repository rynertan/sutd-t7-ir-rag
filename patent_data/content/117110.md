# Diesel engine fuel injection timing control system.

## Abstract
An electronic control unit 30 provides closed loop control of the instant at which an injector 14 injects fuel into the cylinder 12 of a diesel engine 10 . The unit 30 computes a desired instant of combustion from input values from a speed transducer 16 and a load transducer 24 . Actual instant of combustion is given by a crank angle sensor 22 at the time when a detector 22 senses combustion. The error signal between desired and actual instants of combustion modifies a signal setting the advance of injection over ignition to determine the actual moment of injection by the injector 14 .
