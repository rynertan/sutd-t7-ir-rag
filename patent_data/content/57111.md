# Read only memory.

## Abstract
A read only memory is provided in which the memory cells 24 are single metal gate or silicon gate field effect transistors 26 . Each FET 26 has one of several different thresholds or states. The size or area of the FET gates 64 at the surface of the semiconductor chip are substantially the same regardless of the cells threshold or state. The input to the gates is a ramp, and the cells are rendered conducting by the amplitude of the ramp at a given instance. The output of a cell is fed to several flip flops 42,44,46 , which are synchronized with the input ramp, thereby setting the flip flops in accordance with the threshold or state of the cell. An encoder 48 converts the output from the flip flops to a bit binary signal. This permits a very high density ROM, e.g. 128k on a single chip.
