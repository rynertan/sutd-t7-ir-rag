# Gasified cements for cementing wells.

## Abstract
A cement composition for cementing the annulus between a well casing and a borehold comprises a a hydraulic cement b water and c a gas generating composition which is one of the following I. a nitrogen gas generating material selected from hydrazine, hydrazine sulfate, carbazide, and any mixture of two or more thereof an oxidizing agent selected from hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxyborate tetrahydrate, sodium peroxyborate monohydrate, potassium dichromate, and any mixture of two or more thereof and a reaction rate control material selected from sodium sulfate, calcium sulfate hemihydrate, copper sulfate hemihydrate, copper sulfate, calcium hydroxide, and any mixture of two or more thereof II. a nitrogen gas generating material selected from hydrazine, hydrazine sulfate, carbazide, and any mixture of two or more thereof an oxidizing agent selected from calcium peroxide, zinc peroxide, or a mixture thereof and a reaction rate control material comprising copper sulfate III. a nitrogen gas generating material selected from an ammonium salt of an organic or inorganic acid, hydroxylamine sulfate, carbamide, azodicarbonamide, and any mixture of two or more thereof an oxidizing agent selected from hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxyborate tetrahydrate, sodium peroxyborate monohydrate, and any of two or more thereof a reaction rate control material comprising copper sulfate IV. a nitrogen gas generating material comprising azodicarbonamide an oxidizing agent comprising calcium peroxide and a reaction rate control material comprising copper sulfate and V. any combination of two or more of I, II, III and IV.
