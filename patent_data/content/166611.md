## Description
STABILIZATION OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF 5 CHLORO 3 ISOTHIAZOLONnS This invention is concerned with stabilized solutions of 5 chloro 3 isothiazolones, their preparation, and their use in controlling living organisms. Isothiazolones useful in the present invention are represented by the following structural formula EMI1.1 wherein Y is an unsubstituted or substituted C1 to C8 alkyl group, an unsubstituted or halo substituted C2 C8 alkenyl or C2 C8 alkynyl, preferably C2 C4 alkenyl or C2 C4 alkynyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted C5 C8 cycloalkyl, an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl. R is hydrogen, halo, or C1 C4 alkyl. Representative Y substituents include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, 3,4 dichlorobenzyl, 4 methoxybenzyl, 4 chlorobenzyl, 3,4dichlorophenyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, hydroxymethyl, chloromethyl and chloropropyl. In many instances it is desirable to minimize water, salt, and nitrate levels in isothiazolone biocides. For example, certain emulsions or dispersions require biocidal protection and are sensitive to shock resulting in a precipitate when salts, especially those containing divalent ions, are added. This precipitation precludes the use of biocides containing appreciable salt levels, especially in situations where mechanical stirring is not feasible. In oils and fuels it is desirable to minimize water and salt content. Water in contact with the organic matter in fuel creates conditions suitable for biological growth and the formation of sludge. Also, salts in oils and fuel result in ignition deposits which lead to clogging and corrosion of various mechanical components. In some cosmetic formulations, it is important to control water and salt content. Eliminating the presence of nitrate salts avoids the possibility of nitrosamine formation. Nitrosamines are suspected carcinogens. This invention is directed to the reduction of water and salts, especially nitrates, in stable biocidal isothiazolone compositions. This invention provides a stabilized solution of an isothiazolone of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein Y is an unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or halo substituted alkenyl or alkynyl of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl of 5 to 8 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl, or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl RX is hydrogen, halo, or C1 C4 alkyl comprising 0.5 to 7 of the isothiazolone, 0.5 to 14 of water 68 to 99 by weight of hydroxy solvent of the formulae EMI2.2 wherein R and R1 are hydrogen or lower alkyl, X is CH2OCH2 , CH2 n wherein n is an integer of 1 to 4 and y is an integer of 1 to 150 and 0.15 to 7 of neutralization salt, the percentages being by weight of the four components. The stabilizing solvent used in this invention comprises one or more of those of the following structural formulae EMI3.1 or HO C3H6 yH IIc wherein R and R are hydrogen or lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and the like and X is CH2OCH2 or CH2 n where n is an integer of 1 to 4 and y is an integer of from 1 to about 150. By lower in connection with alkyl groups in this specification we mean WC1 C6 t. Preferred stabilizing solvents include propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and 1,5 pentanediol. The stabilizing solvent is generally employed in an amount of from about 68 to about 99 by weight of the four specified components in the composition with a preferred effective amount being from about 92 to about 98 by weight. Prior to this discovery it was known to employ organic solvents with metal nitrates See especially U.S.Patent 3,870,795, Col. 3, lines 39 54 . However, the solvents were not known to be useful as stabilizers. U.S.Patent 3,870,795, Col. 4, lines 35 45 discloses that nonaqueous solutions containing about 15 of 5 chloro 2methyl 3 isothiazolone 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone 93 7 in dipropylene glycol completely decomposed in 28 days at 500C. U.S. Patents 4,241,214 and 4,396,413 describe metal salt complexes of isothiazolones of Formula I and their use as effective biocidal agents. Current commercial products containing these isothiazolones are sold as aqueous solutions containing divalent nitrate salts which serve as stabilizers for isothiazolones which would otherwise decompose upon storage. While this invention may permit the stabilization of isothiazolones without employing stabilization salts, it should be recognized that this invention may also be used to permit the use of much lower concentrations of the stabilization salts than have hitherto been conventional.Useful stabilization salts which can be employed are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,870,795 and 4,067,878.Preferred stabilization salts fall into two groups 1 Metal nitrates, where the metal is barium, cadmium, calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, lithium, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel, sodium, silver, strontium, tin, zinc and the like and 2 Copper 2 salts where the anion is halide, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, acetate, chlorate, perchlorate, bisulfate, bicarbonate, oxalate, maleate, carbonate, or phosphate. In the preparation of the 5 chloro 3 isothiazolones, it is desired to partially neutralize the intermediate isothiazolone hydrochloride salt to obtain a more stable product this results in the formation of the neutrali zatiori salt as a by product. The neutralization salt does not improve stability except in the case where it is CuC12 and should not generally be considered a stabilizing salt. Typical ranges for the content of the components in the compositions are illustrated in the following Tables all percentages are parts by weight of the total of the four stated components . These ranges may be used individually or in any mathematically possible combination to give preferred formulations.

These ranges may be used individually or in any mathematically possible combinatin to give preferred formulations and the percentages are by weight of the five stated components. TABLE II Hydroxy Neutralization StabilizationIzothiazolone Solvent Salt Water Salt about 0.5 to about 68 to about 0.15 to 0.5 to about 0.01 to about 7.0 about 98.85 about 7 about 14 about 2.0 Preferred about 1 to about 91.8 to about 0.3 to 1.0 to about 0.01 to about 2 about 97.7 about 2 about 4 about 0.2 Most Preferred about 1.5 about 94.4 about 1 about 3 about 0.10 Especially preferred are those formulations which employ sodium chloride or copper chloride as the neutralizing salt, and no post added stabilization salt. Solutions of isothiazolones are used, inter alia, as watercooling system microbiocides, as preservatives for aqueous dispersions or organic polymers, as wood pulp white water slimicides, as cosmetic preservatives, as cutting oil, jet fuel and heating oil preservatives. Solutions of isothiazolones are also applied to solid substrates, such as of fabric, leather, or wood, as a preservative. The products of this invention are especially useful as preservatives for the following 1. Cosmetics, as the invention can be used to eliminate or substantially reduce the presence of nitrates which under certain conditions in the presence of amines or amine precursors may lead to the formation of nitrosoamines 2. Oils and fuels, since added salts and moisture can be eliminated or minimized thus preventing potential corrosion, deposition or sludge formation 3. Emulsions and dispersions that are sensitive to the addition of salts. Examples of these emulsions and dispersions are those contained in a wide variety of products, such as paints, cosmetics, floor polishes and binders. The following Examples will further illustrate this invention, but are not intended to limit it in any way.Furthermore they include comparative data to illustrate the improvement achievable by the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures in degreesCentigrade, unless otherwise stated. In interpreting the results in the Examples it should be noted that our studies show that a temperature of 50 C causes an acceleration effect so that one week at that temperature is equivalent to 2 months at ordinary ambient temperature two weeks is equivalent to 4 months three weeks is equivalent to 6 months and four weeks is equivalent to 8 months, and so on. A temperature of 65 C causes an acceleration effect so that one week at that temperature is equivalent to 7 months at ordinary ambient temperature two weeks is equivalent to 14 months three weeks is equivalent to 21 months our weeks is equivalent to 28 months, and so on. We consider that any product which does not show signs of decomposition in one year 6 weeks at 50 C or about 2 weeks at 650C should be regarded as a stable product. Example 1 Fair Shampoo Nitrate and Nitrite free A solution containing 3 active isothiazolonesN methyl 5 chloroisothiazolin 3 one and N methylisothiazolin 3 one, 2 NaCl, 3 water in dipropylene glycol is used as a preservative for a hair shampoo.The biocide solution will contain no nitrate, nitrite or nitrosamines. The shampoo is treated with biocide solution to provide 20 ppm of active biocide. The resultant shampoo contains no nitrosamine and has no nitrate to react with amines in the shampoo composition.

Formulation To a 250 ml beaker was added 20 gms of Kathon HC1 salt which had been powdered via mortar and pestle, and 25 gms of water. Solid magnesium oxide 1.9 gms was dissolved in the mixture to give a two phase solution having pH 2.87. The toluene layer was removed via separatory funnel , and 0.64 g of Cu NO3 2. 3 H2O stabilizing salt was dissolved in 23.5 g of the aqueous solution, and then diluted with 77.5 g of DPG to give pH 2.1, AI 5.4 , and Cu NO3 2 level of about 0.5 , and MgC12 neutralizing salt level of about 2.4 . This formulation showed no loss in AI during heat aging for 5 wks 55 C or 4 wks 65 C. 1 Kathon biocide is a commercial product presently sold in a 15 mixture of N methyl 5 chloroisothiazolin 3 one A and N methylisothiazolin 3 one B is an approximate 80 20 ratio.EMI12.1 The product contains 60 water, 9 MgCl2 and 15 Mg NO3 2 A specially prepared version of Kathon for cosmetic applications contain 1.5 of an 80 20 mixture of A and B, 75 water, 1 MgC12, and 23 Mg NO3 2. The high levels of Mg NO3 2 are useful in stabilizing A in its aqueous environment, as demonstrated in U.S. Patents 3,870,795 and 4,067,878. By using this invention, Mg NO3 2 is no longer needed for stabilization. The isothiazolones can be isolated and combined with an equivalent of HC1 to form the salt, i.e., Kathon HC1 . Example 5 Thermal Stability Test Thermal stability tests were run on a mixture of 1.13 of 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one and 0.37 of N methyl isothiazolin 3 one solution in propylene glycol, and on 0.7 and 1.5 5 chloro 2 methyl 4isothiazolin 3 one solutions in dipropylene glycol. These solutions were prepared by diluting KATHON biocide see footnote of Example 4 to 1.5 active ingredient with the indicated organic solvents w w . One hundred gram aliquots of each of the three solutions were placed in a 500C hot air oven and stored for 3 months at 500C. Five gram aliquots were removed from each of the three samples just prior to their placement in the oven, and again after 12 days, 33 days and three months at 500C. These 5 gram aliquots were analyzed by HPLC for active ingredient content at the time they were removed from the stored samples.
