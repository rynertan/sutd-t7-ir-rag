# Torque converter.

## Abstract
A torque converter comprises a plurality of friction ele ments 28 and 50 which are mounted rotatably on arms 25 and 45 which are pivotable on holders 20 and 40 . The hol ders 20 and 40 are interconnected by tie members 62 . Rotation of an input shaft 1 rotates the holder 20 and, via the tie members 62 , the holder 40 . The friction elements 28 and 50 are thus flung outwardly into contact with control members 64 and 65 , on which they roll. The friction elements also abut and roll on one another, so that at least a major proportion of axial forces on the friction element in operation, are held in equilibrium by the elements themselves. The rota tion of the friction elements 28 and 50 is transferred to an output shaft 2 by planetary gearing. The transmission ratio is varied by moving the control member 64 towards and away from the control member 65 which changes the circumfer ence of the path over which the element 28 rolls. The holder 40 is displaceable axially to accomodate this adjustment to keep the friction elements 28 and 50 in contact. The geometrical configuration and disposition of the fric tion elements 28 and 50 are important and are discussed in the description.
