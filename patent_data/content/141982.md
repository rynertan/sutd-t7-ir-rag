# PULVERIZING MILL HAVING PURE ROLLING MOTION BETWEEN THE GRINDING ROLL AND THE BOWL

## Abstract
A pulverizing mill 10 having a grinding bowl 12 mount ed so as to be rotatable about a central axis 14 , and a frusto conical grinding roll 20 which is in parallel relationship with the grinding surface of the bowl. The bowl is mounted at an angle 15 60 to the horizontal. The bowl and roll are con structed such that the ratio of the horizontal radial distance from the axis of the bowl to the lower, inner end of the roll where it lies adjacent to the bowl surface R₁ , compared to the radius of that point from the axis about which the roll rota tes r₁ , is equal to the ratio of the horizontal radial distance from the axis of the bowl to the upper end of the roll at the point where it lies adjacent to the bowl surface R₂ , compared to the radius of that point from the axis about which the roll ro tates r₂ , so that as the bowl and roll rotate about their respec tive axes 14, 22 , the roll surface moves across the bowl sur face with only rolling movement, rather than a combination of rolling and sliding movement, to thereby reduce the wear on these surfaces.
