# Drive mechanism for cable drums.

## Abstract
A drum hoist or winch in which at least one circular cam lobe 68 mounted eccentrically on an axle 50 is intercon nected with a like circular cam lobe 68 mounted on a second axle 52 by inboard linkage whereby rotation of one axle 50 will rotate the other axle 52 in unison. A hoist drum 56 mounted concentrically with the axle 50 can thus be rotated in unison with another hoist drum 58 on the axle 52 to wind or unwind one or more cables 12, 14 thereon. A preferred embodiment has three circular cam lobes 68, 70, 72 mounted eccentrically on each axle 120 angularly out of phase with each other with inboard link plates 74, 76, 78 interconnecting the corresponding cam lobes on each axle in rotatable relation.
