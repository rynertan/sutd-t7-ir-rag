# OPTICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR

## Abstract
An optical processing system based on noncoherent light processing employs both geometrical and diffraction optical systems. One portion of the optical system 25, 26 preforms a subtraction operation of the image from itself where one of the subtracted images is relatively defocused and one is de layed in time from the other. The subtracted image is edge enhanced 32 and then applied to a spatial filter employing an interferometer 56 in which spatial filters 61, 62 are con tained in the interferometer iris plates 59, 60 . Additional spatial filtering 72 is performed on the interference image and the processed image is displayed in an appropriate display 78, 81 which can selectively view the processed image, the un processed image, or combinations of the two. Light storage elements are employed for storing the processed images in ap propriate buffers 23, 24, 64 over a given length of time. The buffers are read out by a flashlamp. Suitable shutters 15, 16, 80, 82 are closed during the readout process.
