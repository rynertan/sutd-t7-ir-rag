# Method of correcting radiation image read out error.

## Abstract
In a radiation image read out system, a stimulable phos phor sheet 3 carrying a radiation image stored therein is scanned by stimulating rays 1c in forward and backward main scanning directions A by use of galvanometer mirrors 2a, 2b . Light emitted from the stimulable phosphor sheet upon exposure to the stimulating rays is detected and con verted into an electric image signal at each position on for ward and backward scan lines. The electric image signal is corrected by use of a correction coefficient predetermined for each position on the scan lines in accordance with the devia tion in position in a sub scanning direction at each position on the scan lines, thereby correcting a read out error in the image signal caused by distortion of the scan lines arising when the stimulable phosphor sheet is scanned by the stimulating rays in the forward and backward main scanning directions by use of the galvanometer mirrors.
