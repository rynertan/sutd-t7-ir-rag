# Coil inserting apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reducing the insertion required force in a coil inserting apparatus, wherein a coil and an insulating material piece are automatically inserted into the groove 3 of a stator core 1 by the operation of a coil pusher 101 . A current flows from a piezo electric element 102 accommo dated with the coil pusher 101 , when insertion resistance applied upon the coil pusher has increased, through the relay solenoid valve to drive a hydraulic cylinder 104 thereby to raise the coil wrapping jig 57 , while, when the insertion pressure has suddenly increased, the current stops to keep fundamentally the coil wrapping jig synchronous to the motion of the coil pusher 101 .
