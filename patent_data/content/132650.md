## Description
ALUMINIUM ALLOY FOR STRUCTURAL SHAPED ELEMENTS OF VEHICLES AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING SAID ELEMENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an aluminium alloy and to a process, which is particularly useful for manufacturing, with said alloy, structural shaped elements of vehicles, in particular simple shaped elements or box type composite shaped elements for motor vehicles, such as hoods for motors and for baggage compartments, doors, mudguards, roofs, panelings and the like. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART As is known, the present tendency is to manufacture lighter and lighter motor vehicles in order to obtain several advantages, known to the technicians of this branch, among which, in particular, that of achieving substantial savings in the energy required in the running of said motor vehicles. In the frame of this tendency, considerable efforts have been made and are being made with a view to preparing and improving light alloys based on aluminium and susceptible of being utilized in the manufacture of structural shaped elements for vehicles in general and for motor vehicles in particular, said light alloys assuring, besides a weight saving, also an excellent corrosion resistance and good properties of energy absorption, such properties resulting in advantages in terms of safety in case of vehicle crash. In order that the aluminium alloy may be suited to the above mentioned use, it is indispensable for said alloy to possess, at the same time, a high mechanical resistance stable in the long run and a high c4ld formability, said formability being meant also as a good capability of retaining the shape after pressing.The physical mechanical properties of the alloy, moreover, must be such as to assure a good resistance to dent, the possibility of carrying out, without defects, seaming operations with block folding, and, finally, of avoiding, during forming, the formation of Lueder bands which, as is known, may appear on a surface of a metal when such metal is deformed beyond its elastic limit with creep of the metal itself , and which involve successive surface treatment operations, The abovesaid properties cannot be imparted all together to a single 21 ght alloy to the extent in which, conversely, they can be imparted to a normal mild steel for deep pressing, especially in relation ta the severe requirements connected with the forming of the panelings and relevant inner reinforcing frameworks for vehicles and for automobiles in particular. As a consequence thereof, the current technology is prevailingly directed to utilize two different alloy families, namely a first family characterized by the optimization of the mechanical characteristics to the prejudice of the formability which results to be by far lower than the one of mild steel for the use in the outer panelings, and a second family characterized by the optimization of the formability to the prejudice of the mechanical resistance for the use in the inner frameworks, which require very marked shapings. In the limits of the said first alloy family, the prevailing trend of the users . is directed towards the utilizatinn of alloy 6009 T4 designation according toAluminium Association , while in the limits of the second family, alloy 5182 0 is predominantly used. The typical compositions of such alloys are those known and indicated hereinbelow by weight 6009 T4 5182 0 Si 0.6 1.0 0,20 max. Fe 0.50 max. 0.35 max. Mg 0.40 0.8 4.0 5.0 Cu 0.15 0.6 0.15 max. Mn 0.20 0.8 0.20 0.50 Cr 0.10 max. 0.10 max. Zn 0.25 max. 0.25 max. Al balance to 100 balance to 100 Obviously, the use of two alloys different from each other involves problems in the storage of the stocks and above all in the scrap recovery and recycling operations, with consequent substantial technical and economical dis advantages. Furthermore, the aluminium alloys of said first family are not susceptible of being shaped in conventional dies as are utilized for the shaping of mild steel, wherefore it is practical impossible to use the existing pressing lines of the automotive industry, what entails, of course, disadvantages of both technical and economical nature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a light alloy based on aluminium which exhibits, jointly, in a balanced manner, a good mechanical resist tance, a good formability and a good capability of retaining the shape, in order to be suitable for being utilized for the manufacturing of both outer and inner shaped elements of vehicle components, said mouldability and capability of retaining the shape being such as to permit the use, without substantial modifications, of the dies and pressing processes in use for steel and similar materials, for said manufacture. Another object of the present invention resides in a process for manufacturing shaped elements of vehicles starting from cast plates and billets of said alloy, in particular for manufacturing box type composite shaped elements for motor vehicles. These and still other objects, which will become apparent from the following description, are achieved, according to the present invention, by A an aluminium alloy having the following composition in by weight Si from 0.25 to 0.35 Fe from 0.20 to 0.30 Mg from 0.85 to 1.1 Cu from 0.10 to 0.25 Other elements representing impurities each below 0.1 , in the aggregate below 0.2 Al the balmice to 100 , said Mg and Si amounts being selected in order that Mg results in a stoichiometric excess with respect to the compound Mg2Si,said excess being comprised between 0.25 and 0.67i and by B a process for working said alloy which comprises the following operations a casting a body for plastic working consisting of the alloy as per point A hereinbefore b homogenizing said Al alloy body at a temper ature ranging from 540 to 5800C, followed by quench ing c working said homogenized body, in the form of semifinished products , such as sheets, structural shapes and the like d solution heat treatment of said semifinished products Ettemperaturesranging from 525 to 5350C for 5 10 minutes, followed by hardening and ageing at room temperature, said semifinished.products assuming a yield strengt Rp 0.2 and a modulus of elasticity E such that the Rp 0.2 E ratio ranges from 1.2x10 3 to 1.7x10 3, thus obtaining semifinished products in state T4, which are formable in an easy and stable manner e forming of said semifinished products T4 in form of shaped elements f artificial ageing of said shaped elements at a temperature ranging from 180 to 2200C for a time from 30 to 90 minutes, in order to raise their machanical resistance to a degree of substantial stability, with a yield strength Rp 0.2 ranging from 165 to 200 N mmê. By means of said alloy and said process for transforming it into shaped elements, it becomes possible as will be demonstrated later on to utilize one alloy only, namely the alloy according to the invention, for both the outer panelings and the inner frameworks of vehicles, said panelings and frameworks being obtainable, according to the invention, by shaping sheets and the like composed of said alloy in the state T4 by means of dies and pressing processes in use for steel. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The characteristics of the alloy according to the invention and the corresponding process for transforming it into shaped elements for vehicle components are described in detail hereinafter as a preferred but not exclusive embodiment , making reference to the annexed drawings, wherein figure 1 shows, in an exploded perspective view, an outer panel of a motor hood with relevant inner element reinforcing framework figure 2 shows a sectional partial and enlarged view in elevation of the hood and relevant reinforcing inner element, after assembling, shown in figure 1. The alloy according to the invention is obtained by casting into water a body having the above indicated com position, in the form of a rolling plate or of an extrusion billet. Hereinafter, for the sake of simplicity, reference will be made to said plate, being understood that the corresponding metallurgical process of successive working is transferable to said billet . Said plate is homogen ized at a temperature in the range of from 540 to 5800C for a time of maximum 24 hours under steady state usually 8 12 hours , whereupon it is quenched to room temperature, preferably by means of water rain . In the case of a continuous working cycle, said cooling can be stopped at the rough working temperature, as explained hereinafter . The so homogenized alloy plate is then roughly worked, by subjecting it to strong runs, starting from a pre heating temperature ranging from 4600 to 5000C. For a fully cooled plate after the aforesaid homogenizing operation, the preheating time period for rough .work ing shall be as short as possible . The rough worked plate is then directly transformed,by rolling, into semifinished products in the form of sheets having final thicknesses,already suitable for use, in the range of from 0.7 to 1.5 mm. Said semifinished products are then subjected to a solution heat treatment by means of heating to 525 535 C 5 10 minutes under steady state followed by hardening by means of water quenching. During said solution heat treatment hardening step, Mg2 Si forms in a supersaturated solid solution at room temperature, while free Mg remains dissolved in aluminium since the amounts of Mg and Si in the alloy, according to the invention, are reciprocally proportioned in such amounts as to have a stoichiometric excess of Mg in respect of said Mg2 Si compound, to the specific purpose of attaining an optimization of the alloy s formability characteristics, in particular of its drawability. On the other hand, said Mg excess shall not exceed amounts of the order of 0.6 0.7 by weight, because a high er Mgexcess would reduce the solubility of said compound Mg2 Si in Al and, consequently, the hardening effect by precipitation of same during the successive artificial ageing step after forming as better illustrated later , which causes an increase in the mechanical resistance of the Åal loy. Said hardened sheets are flattened and then allowed to naturally age at room temperature T4 state after 15 days, the yielding values are substantially stabilized at low values, and the sheets are ready for being formed into shaE ed elements in an easy and stable manner. In fact, according to the invention, the alloy composition and relevant metallurgical working cycle described hereinabove are combined in such way as to impart to the semifinished products sheets, structural shapes in the T4 state, ready for the forming operations,a yield strength Rp 0.2 and an elastic modulus E such that the Rp 0.2 E ratio ranges from 1.2 x x 10 3 to 1.7x10 3 very close to the one of steels for deep pressing , so that the semifinished products are particularly suited to be easily shaped in a stable manner i.e. with an exact shape retaining after shaping and free from defects, also by means of dies and with conventional pressing process used for steel, without bringing substantial modifications thereto. The semifinished products in state T4 mentioned above are then transformed, by cold pressing, into shaped elements for vehicles, such elements, after pressing, being subjected to an artificial ageing operation to bring about hardening precipitation of Mg, Si with consequent raising of the mechanical characteristics to a substantial stabili ty level, with a yield strength ranging from 155 to 200 N mm. Said artificial ageing is accomplished by heating said shaped elements to a temperature from 1800 to 2200C for a time between 30 and 90 minutes. Before said ageing step, said shaped elements can be provided with a surface coating painting susceptible of hot. tardening, so that, in a single successive heating step at 180 2200C, the abovesaid artificial ageing of the alloy as well as the stable hardening of the paint take place. The abovesaid shaped elements can be utilized for outer panelings as well as for inner frameworks of vehicle components, in particular box type composite components of motor vehicles, such as hoods for motors and for baggage com partments,doors,udguards,roofs and the like,since, as is mentioned hereinabove, the semifinished parts sheets, structural shapes obtained from the alloy and by the process according to the invention are, in state T4, easily shapable without defects in particular without judder bands and, after shaping, they can be hardened till assuming, permanently, a high mechanical resistance. In particular, the formability drawability and shape stability of the alloy according to the invention are better than those already good of alloy 5182 0, and very close to those excellent of deep pressing steel P.eP04 UNI 8092, according to Italian Standards UNI , while the deformation resistance characteristics after artificial ageing are always higher than those of alloy 5182 0 and only slightly lower than those of alloy 6009 T4, in respect of which, however, the alloy of the invention has the considerable advantage of improving both formability and shape retaining as will be proved later on, in the examples . The formability of the alloy sheets according to the invention state T4 enables to seam the sheets edges by unblock folding, shows position 2 in figure 2, while the mechanical strength of said sheets after shaping and artificial ageing secures a good resistance to dent to shaped elements. Finally, the alloy and the relevant process for transforming same which are described hereinabove permit to obtain a statistically disoriented and substantially free from rough precipitates, fine grain recrystallization structure of the alloy, said structure being suitable for ensuring, besides excellent formability properties, also an excellent corrosion resistance. In relation to what is described hereinbefore it is therefore apparent that a composite component for vehicles for example a motor hood represented in figure 1, to which reference is made here which has to be composed of an outer shaped paneling la endowed with a good shape stability with surface flatness, as well as with a good dent resistance and of an inner reinforcing framework ib shaped to deep and complex forms, can be advantageously manufactured by using a single alloy, namely the alloy of the invention, which thus replaces both alloy 5182 0 in said inner framework, and alloy 6009 T4 in said outer paneling. The following examples, which are only for an illustrative but not limitative purpose, will provide more detailed data relating to the invention, always making refer ence to the annexed drawings already briefly described herein.Example 1 An alloy having the composition given hereinbelow by weight was cast in the form of a plateSi 0.25 Fe 0.20ç Mg 0.85 Cu 0.12ç. other elements, such as impurities Mn 0.015 Cr 0.001ç Zn 0.013ç Al the balance to 100 the free Mg,once the quenching product Mg2Si has formed, resulted to be of 0.42 . Said plate was homogenized by means of a 12 hour heating at 56000 followed by water rain cooling and then rough shaped after heating to 475 C. The rough shaped product so obtained was then rolled, by a conventional method, till obtaining a sheet with a thickness of 0.9 mm. This sheet was subjected to a solution heat treatment hardening by heating to 5300C 8 minutes followed by cooling with water rain. The so hardened sheet was allowed to age at room temperature for 15 days, thus obtaining said alloy in the T4 state, the characteristics of which are indicated in Tables I and II in such Tables, the alloy is designated as AI 02 1 .Said sheet in the T4 state was then caused to artificial age for 1 hour at 2000C the characteristics, after such ageing, are indicated too in said Tables I andII, in which, by way of comparison, also analogous characteristics of alloys 5182 and 6009, as well as of mild steel Fe P04 are reported. In said Tables, the symbols of the various characteristics therein indicated have the following meanings Rm unitary ultimate tensile strength Rp 0.2 unitary deviation from proportionality strength yielding strength A5 percentage elongation at break HB Brinell hardness 2.5 mm ball, load 613 Newton time 15 seconds Dent static load in N necessary to produce,on a 0.9 mm thick, hydraulically preformed with a 2 deformation cap, a permanent 1 mm impression dent resistance parameter Rp 0.2 E ratio between unitary yielding strength and elastic modulus Bendab. bendability, expressed as work harden ing degree by which a 0.9 mm thick specimen breaks due to bending around a spindle having a 0.5 mm radius Formability, expressed by r index normal plastic anisotropy coef ficient, according to known standard ASTM E 517 n index work hardening index,according to known standard ASTM E 646 Erichsen deflection deep drawing index ac cording to known standard ISO R 149. state of the material T4 after hardening and natural ageing ready for forming T6 after artificial ageing 0 annealed, ready for forming ttv after heat treatment simulating paint bak ing 1800C for 0.8 hours, plus 1400C for 1 hour Spot weldability evalusted according to the known US standard MIL W 6858. Example 2 In the form of a plate, an alloy having the following composition by weight was castSi 0.35 Fe 0.30g Mg 1.1 Cu 0.20 other elements, such as impurities Mn 0.013 Cr 0.002 Zn 0.013 Al the balance to 100 . The free Mg, once the quenching product Mg2Si has formed, resulted to be of 0.50 . Said plate was homogenized, rough shaped, rolled, hardened and aged by processes and relevant parameters temperatures, times substantially like those of Example 1. The characteristics of the above said alloy designated as AI 02 2 are indicated in Tables I and II.Example 3 Using 0.9 mm thick sheets in the T4 state obtained inExample 2, there were formed employing conventional forming dies and cycles as are utilized for mild steel two shaped elements, respectively an outer element and an inner element for motor vehicle motor hood indicated with la and 1b in figures 1 and 2 . Said two shaped elements were then assembled to obtain said motor hood by means of seamings involving block foldings, as indicated at 2 in figure 2. All the above mentioned forming and assembling operations were readily accomplished without problems, obtaining at last a motor hood endowed with a perfect flatness and shape correspondence to the dies, such features being retained even after an ageing heat treatment of the hood at 2200C for 1 hour. Said motor hood so obtained according to the invention exhibited, as compared with an analogous hood produced with equal sheet thicknesses respectively from alloy 6009 outer element and from alloy 5182 inner element , the following advantages possibility of utilizing,.without process drawbacks and product defects, conventional forming dies and cycles as are used for steel a lower alloy cost economical storing of the sheets intended for forming economical and simplified technique for the scrap recovery Example 4 Specimens obtained from the sheets produced as per Examples 1 and 2 both in the T4 state and after artificial ageing were subjected to corrosion tests in neutral saline mist according to standard UNI 5687 65 the obtained results proved, for both short times and long times 400 hours of tests, an excellent corrosion resistance of the alloy according to the invention.Example 5 This examples proves the criticity of the Si and Mg content of the alloy. Following the process of Example 1, there were prepared two sheets having a thickness of 0.9 mm up to the artificial ageing state for 1 hour at 2200C , respectively made of an alloy AI 3 and of an alloy AI 4, both comprising Fe,Al and other elements, such as impurities, in amounts substantially equal to those of the alloy according to the in vention of example 2, while Si and Mg were in different amounts from those of the alby according to the invention, namely AI 3 Si 0.16 0.37 Mg 0.80 1.9 In alloy AI 3, in relation to the too low Si content, Mg2 Si did not form in a sufficient amount to cause the desired hardening, while in the AI 4 alloy the too high freeMg content above the stoichiometric composition Mg2Si 1.3 brought about an inhibiting effect on the solid solubility of Mg2Si in Al during the solution heat treatment,with consequent substantial decrease of hardening due to insufficient precipitation of said Mg2 Si during artificial ageing , as is proved by the data recorded in Table III, compared with the ones of alloy Awl 02 of examples 1 and 2 all the alloys are in state T6, after a 1 hour artificial ageing at 2O00C . The aluminium alloy according to the invention is particularly suited to be used in shaped elements for vehicles, but, as is evident, it can find a useful utilization in all those appliances which require an Al based light alloy endowed with balanced characteristics of formability, shape stability and mechanical stregth. Furthermore, as is apparent, the alloy according to the invention is employable, in a few cases, in composite shaped elements comprising one or more shaped elements consisting of said alloy and one or more shaped elements consisting of another material.
