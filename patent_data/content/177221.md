# Semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A distributed feedback semiconductor laser has gain producing regions formed by superlattice regions 5 sepa rated by semiconductor regions 4 with a greater band gap, and which are transparent to laser radiation. These regions are between guide layers 3,7 which in turn are between cladding layers 2,8 of the semiconductor laser. The semi conductor regions 4 of greater band gap are preferably formed by disordering superlattice regions by diffusing or implanting an impurity therein, as this permits them to be formed with little lattice damage. The result is a semiconduc tor which oscillates in a single longitudinal mode, has a low threshold current, and exhibits a good mode stability against reflected light.
