# PROCESS FOR STABILIZING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS STABILIZED THEREBY

## Abstract
Organic compounds are stabilized, in particular against oxidative degradation, by the addition of sodium borohydride and a transition metal salt, preferably a group VIII metal salt such as nickel chloride. The invention is particularly applicable to amines and fatty acids. The stabilizers are found to have a remarkable synergistic effect in maintaining stability and col our of an amine, which is enhanced by distillation of the amine.
