# MEMORY MAPPING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method of accessing a main random access memory, of the type accessed by sequentially applying row and column ad dresses, permits a computer program to organize data using a virtual addressing scheme different from a real addressing scheme used to organize the storage of the same data within the main memory. The method comprises the steps of applying a selected portion of a virtual address as a real row address to the main memory, while simultaneously converting another selected portion of the virtual address into a corresponding real column address, and then applying the corresponding real column address to the main memory.
