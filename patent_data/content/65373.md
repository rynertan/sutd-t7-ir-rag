# Method fabricating a polycrystalline silicon wafer.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a polycrystalline silicon wafer, which method advantageously has the steps of radially out wardly flowing molten liquid of silicon base material on the waf er forming surface of a turntable mechanism by means of cen trifugal force, thereby forming a thin molten liquid layer in a prescribed atmosphere, and cooling and solidifying the same. An apparatus for fabricating the wafer is used to carry out the method with a recover tray arranged at the wafer forming sur face for receiving the excessive silicon liquid scattered, and a wafer tray placed on the recovery tray, and the wafer forming surface is cooled with coolant flowing in the wafer forming me chanism. Thus, large crystalline grains can be grown on the wafer in free states with the atmosphere from the inner sur faces of the casting mold as the conventional method.
