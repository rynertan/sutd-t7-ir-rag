# Method for producing formed products of high molecular compounds.

## Abstract
A formed product of a high molecular compound having a glass transition temperature of not more than about 60 C, which is substantially free of halogenated solvents harmful to the human body, is produced by mixing the high molecular compound, a halogenated solvent and an organic solvent other than the halogenated solvent which is compati ble with the solvent and is less apt to dissolve the high molecular compound to prepare a solution and then main taining the solution at a temperature around the boiling point of the halogenated solvent.
