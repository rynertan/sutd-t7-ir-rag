# Timed token ring with multiple priorities.

## Abstract
A timed token protocol for use in a local area loop communications network is disclosed. The protocol provides three classes of service with a priority relationship between classes. The three classes allow guaranteed bandwidth, interactive and batch services. The classes are implemented by timing the rotation time of a write token to measure instantaneous load. Transmission of information is limited by class of service and the measured write token rotation time. Also disclosed is a hardware embodiment of a loop communications station which implements the timed token protocol.
