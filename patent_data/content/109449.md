## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polycarbonate resins have high impact resist ance with ductility to notch or crack propagation at an average of up to about 0.2 inches thickness when the incident notch is 10 mils thousandths of an inch in radius. Above this average thickness the impact resist ance and ductility of polycarbonate resins decline. This phenomenon is commonly found in glassy plastics and is referred to as the critical thickness for notched impact resistance of a glassy plastic. Additionally, the impact strength of notched polycarbonate resins decreases as temperatures decrease below about 50C and also after aging the polymers at elevated temperatures above about 100etc. These temperatures are commonly found in applications where extremes of heat and cold are to be expected. Thus, it is desirable to use a composition which extends the impact strength and ductility of polycarbonate resins to variable thickness parts or articles of use which resist embrittlement upon exposure to high or low temperatures in a notched or scratched condition. Compositions are known which extend the high impact resistance and ductility characteristics of polycarbonate resins to parts beyond the critical thickness and under low and high temperature aging conditions, but many of these compositions suffer from incompatibilities of the polymeric components which results in poor weldline and knit line strengths of fabricated parts as evidenced by low double gate impact strengths when measured according to ASTM D256. It has been reported in a Research disclosureNo. 20810, Dow Chemical Company, August, 1981 that polycarbonates modified with ethylene octene l copolymer provide good impact strength at increased part thickness. It has now been found that use of a modifier comprising ethylene copolymerized with lower carbon content comonomers, namely, C4to C7 aipha olefin comonomer, and particularly a linear low density polyethylene made with butene l as a comonomer in a polycarbonate resin results in a molding composition that may be utilized to make molded articles having improved properties in comparison with compositions of a polycarbonate and a linear low density polyethylene made with octene l as a comonomer.In particular, polycarbonate modified with a copolymer of ethylene and butene l has superior properties, e.g., impact strength, in comparison with polycarbonate modified at the same ratio with a copolymer of ethylene and octene l, as will be shown later.In addition, the aromatic polycarbonate molding compositions made with modifiers comprising linear low density polyethylene including C4 to C7 alpha olefin comonomers generally are less sensitive to property loss under high shear conditions of processing than those made with linear low density polyethylenes including octene l as a comonomer. Moreover, molded articles of the above two systems will show distinction favorable to C4 C7 alphaolefin comonomers when placed under thermal aging system. Compositions according to the present invention will have a Xeld line strength according to ASTM D256 of greater than about 7.0 ft. lbs. and preferably above about 9.5 ft lbs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the invention comprise a a high molecular weight aromatic polycarbon ate resin and b a linear low density polyethylene made with a C4 C7 alpha olefin, preferably butene l, as a comonomer. The polycarbonate resin may be of the formula EMI3.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical. Preferred polycarbonate resins are of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl,X is selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, chloro, bromo, hydrogen and mixtures thereof, and n is at least 30 or preferably from 40 400. The term lower alkyl includes hydrocarbon groups of from 1 6 carbon atoms. Special mention is made of polycarbonate resins of the formula EMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, and n are as above defined. High molecular weight, thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates in the sense of the present invention are to be understood as homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates and mixtures thereof Which have a number average molecular weight of about 8,000 to more than 200,000, preferably of about 10,000 to 80,000 and I.V. of about 0.30 to 1.0 dl g as measured in methylene chloride at 250C. These polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols such as, for example, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 4 hydroxy phenyl methane, 2 ,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 5 tetrachloro 4 4 dihydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 3,5,3 S tetrabromo 4, 4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, and 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane.Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. These aromatic polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436 or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. It is also possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the aromatic polycarbonate utilized in the practice of this invention.Also employed in the practice of this invention can be blends of any of the above materials to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. Branched polycarbonates, such as are described in U.S. Patent 4,001,184, can be utilized in the practice of this invention, as can blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. The linear low density polyethylene LLDPE may be prepared from state of the art polymerization processes such as those described in U.S. 4,076,698 and Eur. Pat. Appl. 4,645, both of which are incorporated by reference. This polymer may have a density between about 0.89 and about 0.96 gms cc and a controlled concentration of simple side chain branching as opposed to random branching which distinguishes it from polymers such as high pressure low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene. The preferred range of density is from 0.915 to 0.945 gms cc. The LLDPE polymer used in the practice of the invention is made from ethylene and butene l or other alpha olefin of C4 C7 carbon content or mixtures thereof. The comonomer is used in a minor amount, i.e., 10 mol or less of the total amount of monomers. A preferred range is about 1 3 molt. The preferred copolymers have a melt flow ratio of 22 to 32 and preferably 25 to 30, under temperature conditions specified below. The melt flow ratio of the copolymer is another means of indicating its molecular weight distribution. The melt flow ratio MFR range of 22 to 32 corresponds to a Mw Mn value of about 2.7 to 4.1 and the MFS range of 25 to c 30 corresponds to a Mw Mn range of 2.8 to 3.6. The MFR is determined by dividing the HighLoad Melt Index HLMI by the Melt Index MI measured at lower load. The MI is determined according toASTM D 1238, Condition E, measured at 1900C and reported as grams per 10 minute. The HLMI is determined byASTM D 1238, Condition F, measured at 10 times the load used in the melt index test. The density of the LLDPE copolymer employed herein is primarily regulated by the amount of the comonomer which is copolymerized with the ethylene. The addition of increasing amounts of the comonomer to the copolymer results in a lowering of the density of the copolymer. The preferred copolymer is a copolymer made from ethylene and butene l such as Escorene LPX 15 Exxon,Houston, Texas, USA . Typically, it has an unsaturated group content of c 1 and preferably 0.1 to 0.3,C C 1000 carbon atoms and less than about 3 and preferably less than 2 weight percent content at 500C of n hexane extractables. The preferred material is made by theUnipol process which is described in Chem. Eng., December 3, 1979, pp. 80 85 which is incorporated by reference. The compositions of the invention may comprise from 70.0 to 99.5, preferably 80.0 to 99.5 parts by weight of polycarbonate resin a and 0.5 to 30, preferably 0.5 to 20, parts by weight of the linear low density polyethylene b per 100 parts by weight of the resinous components a and b in the composition. A preferred range comprises from about 4.0 to 20 and, more preferably, from about 5.0 to 15 parts by weight of the linear low density polyethylene per 100 parts by weight of the resinous components a and b in the composition. Special mention is made of compositions containing from about 90 to about 92 parts by weight of polycarbonate resin a and at least about 8 parts by weight of the linear low density polyethylene component b up tp about 30 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a and b combined.Such compositions, as will be shown, offer substantial benefits in impact resistance in comparison with those in which the modifier is a low density polyethylene including octene l as the comonomer. The compositions of the invention may include reinforcing fillers, such as aluminum, iron or nickel and the like and nonmetals, such as carbon filaments, silicates, such as acicular calcium silicate, acicular calcium sulfate, wollastonite, asbestos, titanium dioxide, potassium titanate, bentonite, kaolinite and titanate whiskers, glass flakes and fibers and mixtures thereof.It is also to be understood that, unless the filler adds to the strength and stiffness of the composition, it is only a filler and not a reinforcing filler, as contemplated herein. In particular, the reinforcing fillers increase the flexural strength, the flexural modulus, the tensile strength and the heat distortion temperature. Although it is only necessary to have at least a reinforcing amount of the reinforcement present, in general, the reinforcing filler may comprise from about 1 to about 60 parts by weight of the total composition. In particular, the preferred reinforcing fillers are cf glass, and it is preferred to use fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime aluminum borosilicate glass that is relatively soda free.This is known as 1E glass. However, other glasses are useful where electrical properties are not so important, e.g., the low soda glass known as CX glass.The filaments are made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for reinforcement are made by mechanical pulling. The filament diameters range from about 0.003 to 0.009 inch, but this is not critical to the present invention. By glass ribers, it is understood that glass silk, as well as all glass fiber materials derived therefrom including glass fiber fabrics, rovings, staple fibers and glass fiber mats are included. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not they are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in turn to yarns, ropes or rovings, or woven into mats, and the like, is also not critical to the invention. However, when using fibrous glass filaments, they may first be formed and gathered into a bundle known as a strand. In order to bind the filaments into a strand so that the strand can be handled, a binder or binding agent is applied to the glass filaments. Subsequently, the strand can be chopped into various lengths as desired.It is convenient to use the strands in lengths of from about l 8H to about 1 long, preferably less than k in length.These are called chopped strands. Some of these binding agents are polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, particular polyester resins, polycarbonates, starch, acrylic, melamine or polyvinyl alcohol. Preferably, the composition contains from about 1 to about 50 weight percent of the glass fibers. Flame retardant amounts of flame retardants may also be utilized in the composition of the invention in amounts of from 0.5 50 parts by weight per 100 parts of resinous components. Examples of suitable flame retardants may be found in U.S. 3,936,400 and 3,940,366 which are incorporated by reference. Other conventional non reinforcing fillers, antioxidants, extrusion aids, light stabilizers and the like may be added to the composition of the invention if desired. The manner of preparing the invention composition is conventional. Preferably, each ingredient is added by passage through an extruder, or by fluxing on a mill at a temperature dependent on the particular composition.The mixed composition may be cooled and cut into molding granules and molded into the desired shape. DESCRIPTION OF TiE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following examples illustrate the invention.All parts are by weight. EXAMPLE A series of compositionswere prepared using ca.mmercially available linear, low density polyethylenes.Each composition contained 4 parts of the LLDPE, made with butene l or with octene l, per 96 parts by weight of polycarbonate of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane having an I.V. of about 0.46 dl g as measured in methylene chloride at 259C. and was prepared by the conventional method of dry blending by mechanical mixing followed by extrusion at about 2650C. The extrudate was commented into pellets and the pellets were inJection molded into test specimens that measured about 2hW x x and 2ew x x 1 8 . These examples were compared against h composi tion of 4 parts by weight of high density polyethylene, commercially available as USI LB742 , and 96 parts by weight of a standard polycarbonate resin, commercially available as Lexan 141 112. The term double gate is used to refer to the preparation of a molded sample in a mold having two entry ports that result in a weld line at the junction ef the fluid resin in the mold during the molding cycle.The design, preparation of the mclded part, and testing of the following examples are according to ASTM D2S6. Izod impact strengths are reported as ft. lb in. of notch. Double gate values are reported in ft. ib. Below are the results in impact resistance in various test systems.

All others were 100 ductile at failure A copolymer of ethylene and butene l, Exxon Chemical Co., Houston, Texas, U.S.A. A copolymer of ethylene and octene l, Dow Chemical Co., Elidland, Michigan, U.S.A. As clearly shown in the results, the 100 polyca oonat iias high impact resistance in the 1 8 thickness but has lost virtually all its impact resistance at the 1 4 thick mess, this being above the critical point in thickness. The double gate impact resistance value of Sample 1 is high since there is only one polymer present. The second sample is the prior art composition of polycarbonate plus high density polyethylene. A sharp improvement in impact resistance at the thickness is shown however the double t impact resistance is sharply reduced and is brittle failure. The various linear low density polyethylene polycarbonate compositions of samples 3 7 show that the double gate impact resistance of the samples is substantially increased while the k impact resistance is, at worst, only somewhat lowered. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated. A different grade of LLDPE is used Escorene, Melt FlowIndex 1 , and there is used 10 parts by weight of LLDPE and 90 parts by weight of polycarbonate. The following results were obtained after molding and testing Notched Izod Impact, ft. lbs. in.Parts by weight LLDPE PC 1 8 thick 1 4 thick 10 90 14.4 100 9.6 100 Lexane 140 Escorene LPX 1 butene l as comonomer COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2A The general procedure of Example 1 is repeated using instead 10 parts by weight of LLDPE and 90 parts by weight of polycarbonate, and as the LLDPE a copolymer of ethylene and octene l. The following results were obtained after molding and testing Notched Izod Impact, ft. lbs. in.Parts by weight LLDPE PC 1 8 thick 1 4 thick 10 90 8.2 100 4.2 100 Leans 140 Dowlex 61500 0.38 Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., U.S.A. Comparison of Example 2 with ComparativeExample 2A shows that polycarbonate composition. including a linear low density polyethylene made from butene l as a comonomer had significantly superior impact strength and excellent ductile impact strength in thicker sections than did those made with a linear low density polyethylene made from octene l as a comonomer. If the modifier content is at least 10 parts by weight per 100 parts of the total composition, then Example 2 demonstrates that the LLDPE containing butene l is more preferred than theLLDPE containing octene l. Other variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, instead of linear low density copolymers of ethylene with butene l, there can be substituted copolymers of ethylene with, e.g., pentene l, hexene l, heptene l and the like in the range of C4 C7.It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention described which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
