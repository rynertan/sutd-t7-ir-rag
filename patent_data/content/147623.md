# ERROR CORRECTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus are disclosed for converting error syndromes of an error correcting code to pointers which identify the positions of the erroneous bits. Each syndrome is converted by a plurality of hashing functions into a plurality of hash words, which in turn are used to address a plurality of read only stores. The outputs of the read only stores are logically combined to obtain the respec tive error pointer EP . A preferred embodiment uses three hashing functions 41, 43, 45 and three read only stores 53, 55, 57 and combines their outputs by an Exclusive Or function 59 . The storage capacity and the processing time required for syndrome to error pointer conversion are re duced by the disclosed scheme.
