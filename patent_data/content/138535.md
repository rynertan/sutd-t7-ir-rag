# Visual display logic simulation system

## Abstract
An improved logic simulation system including a logic simulator 10 which provides the logic states of elements within an electronic circuit being analyzed, means 18 for as sociating the logic states with a schematic image of the elec tronic circuitry for display on a visual display device 28 and means 18 for designating the colour of the element being displayed which colour represents the logic state of the el ement for a selected point in time.
