# Stripe offset geometry in injection lasers to achieve transverse mode control.

## Abstract
An injection laser of the multilayer planar type, such as, heterostructure GaAs GaAlAs lasers are provided with offset geometry 26, 54, 84, 166 in the configuration of a current confining structure on surface of the device to stabilize the propagating optical beam such that the power output versus current pumping characteristic is linear over an extended range of operating currents. The same offset geometry may also be provided in a channel 162, 184, 204 of the substrate to provide additional or alternate means for stabilizing the propagating optical beam.
