# STABILIZED ZOOM BINOCULAR

## Abstract
A stabilized binocular using a gimbaled and stabilized triple reflecting compensator such as that in Humphrey U.S Patent 3,475,073 having three reflecting surfaces for each binocular path is disclosed. Each of the binocular paths is in convergent light from an objective to and through gimbaled stabilizer assembly to a primary focus that is stabilized with respect to the case. The triple reflecting surfaces disposed to reflect light in the manner corresponding to a single plane mirror at an effective mirroring plane with a displacement between the incident and reflected light beams. The compen sator remains stabilized with respect to inertial space, while the instrument undergoes accidental angular motion. The reflecting property of the compensator brings the image back to the same place on the case despite the accidental angular motion. The displacing function of the compensator enables the image to be displaced to a location where the image does not interfere with the incoming light path. This image is then processed by conventional field optics, including a zoom relay lens. Provision is made to adjustably compensate for displacement and resultant angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk. Resonance is naturally avoided as torquing forces are not applied where inertial centering of the compensator is sufficient.
