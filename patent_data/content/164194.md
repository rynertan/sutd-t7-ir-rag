# Chromatographic strip, method of preparing it and diagnostic kit employing it.

## Abstract
A device comprising at least one strip of a bibulous ma terial for use in a chromatographic system wherein a compo nent of a mixture is partitioned between a liquid phase and an immobile phase. In the chromatographic system the compo nent traverses at least a portion of the strip. The strip generally has a longitudinal edge substantially corresponding to the direction of traverse of the component. The longitudinal edge has the characteristic of substantially the same rate of traversal by the component along this edge when compared to the rate of traversal of the component along the body of the strip. The strips are prepared from a sheet of a bibulous material by non deformative or non compressive cutting of the sheet. The preferred cutting means is a laser beam.
