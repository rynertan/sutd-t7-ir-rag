# Process for the preparation of L aspartic acid N thiocarboxyanhydride.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of L aspartic ac id N thiocarboxyanhydride by the reaction of a 0.75 to 1.25 mo lar solution of an N alkoxy thiocarbonyl L aspartic acid in a lower alkyl acetate solvent with a phosphorous trihalide. The desired product is substantially insoluble in the lower alkyl ace tate solvent and is recovered in pure form without further puri fication or separation steps.
