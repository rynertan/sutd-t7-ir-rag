# Tape electrode for adhesion to the skin.

## Abstract
Electrical lead wire connection to a tape electrode is disclosed. Such electrodes are used for transmitting electrical signals through skin. The tape electrode includes a porous substrate material carrying a conductive layer comprised of finely divided silver metal suspended in a dry adhesive. An electrical lead wire 20 is connected to the conductive layer of the tape electrode by a flat cover member 30 having the same conductive layer on both sides thereof as is carried by the substrate of the tape electrode. One of the conductive layers of the cover member secures the lead wire to the conductive layer of the tape electrode. The other conductive layer of the cover member intimately contacts the skin along with the conductive layer of the tape electrode to provide for good electrical contact therewith when the tape electrode is applied thereto. The adhesive is normally dry and is activated at the time of application by a suitable solvent.
