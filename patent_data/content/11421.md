# Plastics foam production.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for making plastics foam such as polyurethane foam in the form of a pre froth for filling moulds, using a fluorocarbon as a gas producing agent. To avoid gas break out and facilitate control of density and qual ity according to the invention the pressurised composition undergoes several pressure drops. In one preferred form the pressure drops are produced at automatically controlled valves. In another embodiment the pressure drops take place at orifice plates.
