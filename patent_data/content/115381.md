# Apparatus for detecting the angular position and angular velocity of a rotatable member and a method of assembling the apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting the angular position and angular velocity of a rotatable member such as a rotatable part of a steering system mounted in a vehicle and a method of assembling the apparatus. The apparatus includes a disc 14 secured on the outer periphery of a steering shaft 12 , and a sensor 16 mounted on a steering column tube 18 . The sensor 16 has projecting protions in which a light emitting element 160 and a light receiving element 162 are provided, respectively. The projecting portions are designed not to contact the disc 14 to avoid damaging the disc during assembly.
