# Track link for a tracked vehicle.

## Abstract
A track link is provided with a slideway 13 in which a steel or nylon load bearing shell 18 bonded to a rubber road engagement pad 17 can be speedily engaged. The load bearing shell has a bowed cross sectional configuration which extends laterally in the slidway to increase retention when subjected to centrifugal forces tending to tear the pad away from the link.
