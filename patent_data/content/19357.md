# Copper chelates of 2 hydroxybenzophenones, methods of stabilizing polymer compositions therewith and stabilized polymer compositions.

## Abstract
Copper chelates of 2 hydroxybenzophenones, are long lasting UV light absorbers which may be employed to stabilized organic compositions, and particularly polymers such as polyparabanic acid, against degradation on exposure to UV light. A stabilizing amount of the chelate is incorporated in the composition or is prepared in situ from a copper salt of a weak acid and the 2 hydroxybenzophenone.
