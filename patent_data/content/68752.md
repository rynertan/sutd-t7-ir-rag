## Description
DESCRIPTION CALCIUM INTERCALATED BORONATED CARBON FIBRE The invention relates to a mesophase pitch derived carbon fibre and particularly to a carbon fibre which has been boronated and intercalated with calcium. It is well known to spin a mesophase pitch into a fibre, thermoset the pitch fibre by heating it in air, and carbonize the thermoset pitch fibre by heating the thermoset pitch fibre in an inert gaseous environment to an elevated temperature. It is preferable to use mesophase pitch rather than isotropic pitch for producing the carbon fibres because the mesoph√Öase pitch derived carbon fibre possesses excellent mechanical properties. Furthermore, it is preferable to use a mesophase pitch having a meshophase content of at least about 70 by weight for the process. Carbon fibres have found a wide range of commercial uses. In certain uses, it is desirable to use carbon fibres which possess both excellent mechanical properties and good electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity is usually described in terms of resistivity.Typically, a mesophase pitch derived carbon fibre which has been carbonized to a temperature of about 25000C has a resistivity of about 7 microohm metres and aYoung s modulus of about 413.6 GPa. The same carbon fibre heat treated to about 30000C has a resistivity of about 3.3 microohm metres. The cost for obtaining temperatures of 25000C and particularly 30000C is very high. Not only is it closely to expend the energy to reach the high temperatures, but the equipment needed to reach such high temperatures is costly and deteriorates rapidly due to the elevated temperatures. The present invention allows the production of a mesophase pitch derived carbon fibre having a resistivity of less than about 2 microohm metres,and preferably about 1 microohm metre, with a maximum heat treating temperature of from about 20000C to about 23000C. The present invention relates to a mesophase pitch derivated carbon fibre which has been boronated and intercalated with calcium. In the preferred embodiment there is a calcium to boron weight ratio of about 2 1 in the carbon fibre. In the absence of boron, the calcium does not intercalate into the carbon fibre very well. Even very small amounts of boron enhance the intercalation of the calcium. Generally, 0.1 by weight boron or even less is sufficient to improve substantially the intercalation of calcium into the carbon fibres. For any given amount of boron in a carbon fibre, the resistivity generally increases as the amount of intercalated calcium increases at the low end, below a calcium to boron weight ratio of 2 1. It is believed that the boron acts as an acceptor and the calcium acts as an electronic donor. The interaction between the boron and the calcium is such that a maximum resistivity is reached and then the resistivity is reduced until a minimum is reached for a calcium to boron weight ratio of about 2 1. Apparently high conductivity is associated with the donor state. As the amount of calcium increases so that the ratio is greater than 2 1, the resistivity increases because a multiple phase condition exists. Generally, if one were to boronate a carbon fibre in the absence of calcium, the maximum amount of boron which could be introduced into the carbon fibre is about 1.2 by weight. The presence of the intercalcated calcium, however, substantially increases the maximum amount of boron. It is expected that about 10 by weight or more of boron can be introduced into the carbon fibre in the presence of the intercalated calcium. In addition, it is expected that as much as 20 by weight of calcium can be intercalated into the carbon fibre in the presence of the boron. Surprisingly, the boron and calcium can be introduced into the carbon fibre without chemically reacting with the carbon fibre so that a single phase is maintained. Heat treatments at elevated temperatures can result in the formation of new phase, calcium borographite. It is believed that the presence of the intercalated calcium results in cross linking between layer planes in the carbon fibre and improved mechanical properties are obtained. Excellent values for tensile strength and Young s modulus are obtained for the calcium intercalated boronated fibres even though relatively low process temperatures are used. For example, a carbon fibre according to the invention which has been produced using a process temperature of about 20000C possesses mechanical properties comparable to a conventional mesophase pitch derived carbon fibre which has been subjected to a process temperature of 30000C. In addition, the carbon fibre according to the invention possesses much lower resistivity compared to the conventional carbon fibre. Surprisingly, the carbon fibre according to the invention possesses a relatively high interlayer spacing as compared to the typical interlayer spacing of 3.37 Angstroms of a carbon fibre which has been subjected to a heat treatment of about 30000C. According to the prior art, one would expect a deterioration of mechanical properties for larger values of interlayer spacing for the carbon fibres. The maximum inter layer spacing occurs for a calcium to boron weight ratio of about 2 1 as in the case for the minimum resistivity. Generally, about 0.5 by weight boron and about 1 by weight calcium provides a good quality carbon fibre according to the invention. The present invention also relates to a method of producing a meshophase pitch derived carbon fibre having a low resistivity and excellent mechanical properties, and comprises the steps of boronating and intercalating with calcium,a carbon fibre having a diameter of leSs than 30 microns and derived from a mesophase pitch having a mesophase content of at least about 70 by weight mesophase. The steps for boronating and intercalating can be carried out simultaneously or consecutively, boronating being first. The preferred embodiment is to carry out the method to produce a calcium intercalated boronated carbon fibre having a calcium to boron weight ratio of about 2 1. The boronating can be carried out witth elemental boron, boron compounds, or a gaseous boron compound. A calcium compound such as for example CaNCN can be used. Oxygen containing compounds of calcium are less desirable because of the possible detrimental effect of the oxygen on the carbon fibre. Boronating up to about 1.2 by weight maintains a single phase in the carbon fibre. Greater amounts of boron tend to produce boron carbide, B4C. In carrying out the present invention, the carbon fibre has a diameter of less than 30 microns and preferably about 70 microns. Further objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the following specification and in part will be obvious therefrom without specifically being referred to, the same being realized and attained as pointed out in the claims hereof. Illustrative, non limiting Examples of the practice of the invention are set out below. Numerous other examples can readily be evolved in the light of the guiding principles and teachings contained herein.The examples given herein are intended to illustrate the invention and not in any sense limit the manner in which the invention can be practiced. The Examples were carried out using mesophase pitch derived carbon fibres having diameters of about 8 microns. The mesophase pitch used to produce the fibres had a mesophase content of about 80 by weight. The carbon fibres were produced using conventional methods and were carbonized to about 17000C.Lower or higher carbonizing temperatures could have been used. The use of carbon fibres made the handling of the fibres simple because of the mechanical properties exhibited by carbon fibres. The best mode used in the Examples simultaneously boronated and calcium intercalated the carbon fibres.This does not preclude the advantage of consecutive treatments for commercial operations. The method used is as follows. Finely ground graphite, so called graphite flour, was blended with elemental boron powder. The weight percentage of boron was selected to about the desired weight percentage for the carbon fibres. This mixture amounted to about 600 grams and was roll milled for about 4 hours to mix and grind the graphite and boron thoroughly. The mixture was then calcined in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of about 25000C for about one hour. Any inert atmosphere would have been satisfactory. The boronated graphte flour was blended withCaNCN powder having particles less than about 44 microns to form a treatment mixture. The amount of CaNCN is determined by the amount of calcium to be intercalated. The weight of the carbon fibres being treated as compared to the amount of the treatment mixture used is very small. As a result, the weight percentage of the boron in the treatment mixture is about the same for the combination of the carbon fibres and the treatment mixture. This simplifies the selection of a predetermined weight percentage of boronating for the carbon fibres. The amount of calcium intercalation must be determined experimentally by varying the amount of the calcium compound used and, the treatment time. It should be recognized that the vapour pressure of the boron is much lower than the calcium. The boronation is a result of atomic diffusion whereas the intercalation of calcium is a result of vapour diffusion. For each Example, six carbon fibres were used and each fibre had a length of about 1 0 cm. Each of the carbon fibres was suspended inside a graphite container using a graphite form. The graphite form maintained the carbon fibre in a preselected position while the treatment mixture was added to the graphite container. The treatment mixture was vibrated around each carbon fibre to obtain a uniform and packed arrangement. The six graphite containers were placed in a graphite susceptor and heated inductively to a predetermined maximum temperature for about 15 minutes. The furnace chamber was evacuated to about 5 x 10 5 Torr prior to the heat treatment and then purged with argon during the heating cycle. An inert gas other than argon could be used. The process could be carried out using BC13, boranes or water soluble salts such as H3B03. In addition,CaC12 could have been used. Of course, a wide range of other compounds for supplying boron and calcium could be realized easily experimentally in accordance with the criteria set forth herein.Examples 1 to 18 Examples 1 to 18 were carried out to obtain about 0.5 by weight of boron in the carbon fibres and varying amounts of intercalated calcium. The maximum temperature for the heat treatment was 20500C. Table 1 shows the results of Examples 1 to 18.The amount of the intercalated calcium varied from about 0.5 to about 3.6 by weight. The Young s modulus for each of the carbon fibres was extremely high and the tensile strength was also very good.The resistivity showed a minimum of about 1.8 microohmmetres for about 1 by weight calcium the interlayer spacing, Co 2 was about a maximum for that value.

The maximum temperature for the heat treatment was 20500C. Table 2 shows the results of Examples 19 to 40.By interpolation, it can be seen that as in Examples 1 to 18, a calcium to boron weight ratio of 2 1 results in the lowest resistivity, about 1.1 microohm metres, and a large value for the interlayer spacing.

In addition, the interlayer spacing increases from a calcium content of about 3.8 to 8.5 by weight and would be expected to be a maximum at about 10 by weight in accordance with the invention.
