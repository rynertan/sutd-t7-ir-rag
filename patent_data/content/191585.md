## Description
This invention relates to electrorheological fluids Research has been effected, and is being intensified, with a view to improving both the dispersed and the continuous phases of electrorheological fluids see, for example, UK Patents Nos. 1501635 1570234 and UK Patent Applications Nos. 2100740A 2119392A and 2153372A. However, the mechanisms by which electrorheological phenomena occur are still not well understood this lack of understanding and, in particular, the absence of a quantitative theory by which to determine the phenomena hamper the development of improved electrorheological fluids. All electrorheological fluids for which practical application has been put in prospect have hitherto comprised small quantities of water, believed to be principally associated with the dispersed phase. Rigorous drying prevents electrorheological fluids from exhibiting significant electrorheological phenomena. From an application standpoint, however, the presence of water is undesirable it may result in device corrosion operating temperature limitations and significant electrical power consumption which may itself lead to thermal instability in the device. US patent 3,553,708 describes electrorheological fluids which exhibit an electrorheological effect in response to a light modulated signal. Such fluids, which are referred to as photoelectroviscous fluids, are not intended to undergo a change of viscosity under the influence of an applied electrical field alone, but to do so only after they are photostimulated. The effects described in US 3,553,708 are utilised for the control of flow of photoelectroviscous recording inks. According to the present invention an electrorheological fluid comprises a liquid continuous phase and a dispersed phase characterised in that the dispersed phase is a semiconductor having an electrical conductivity at ambient temperature of from 10 ² to 10 ¹¹ mho cm ¹ and a positive temperature conductivity coefficient, the electrorheological properties of the fluid not being photo induced, the fluid being anhydrous or containing water up to 5 v v of the fluid. It will be understood that the properties of the fluid are not dependent upon any photo induced conductivity of the dispersed phase or upon the presence of water either in the disperse phase or the continuous phase, the properties being maintained even if the fluid is rendered anhydrous by drying the disperse phase under vacuum at 70 C for 3 days to constant weight and by drying the continuous phase by passage through an activated alumina column at 70 C. Preferably the electrorheological fluids of the invention are anhydrous to the extent obtainable with the drying conditions indicated above. However small amounts of water in the fluid may be tolerated, preferably no more than 1 v v. Preferably the dispersed phase has an electrical conductivity, at ambient temperature, from 10 ¹⁰ mho cm ¹ to 10 ² mho cm ¹, typically from 10 ⁹ or 10 ¹⁰ to 10 ⁴ mho cm ¹. Particularly preferred semiconductors are the organic semiconductors examples of which include materials which comprise an unsaturated fused polycyclic system, preferably an electron rich one. Preferably the unsaturation comprises conjugated π bonds, especially an aromatic fused polycyclic system which may comprise at least one heteroatom, for example, a nitrogen or an oxygen atom. One class of such electronic conductor which has been found to be suitable for use in the present invention comprises those organic semiconductors wherein the fused polycyclic system comprises a substituted or unsubstituted porphin or azaporphin system for example wherein the fused polycyclic system comprises a phthalocyanine system, such as a metallophthalocyanine system. In such systems the metal is suitably a transition metal. By transition metal is meant herein any metal from Groups VIA to VIII, inclusive and also Group IB of the Periodic Table, for example copper. For copper phthalocyanine the electrical conductivity at ambient temperature is ca. 10 ⁷ mho cm ¹. The organic semiconductor may be a monomeric, usually a crystalline monomeric, material alternatively, it may be a polymeric material. Polymeric organic semiconductors useful in the present invention comprising phthalocyanine moieties may be prepared by replacing the phthalic anhydride used in the conventional synthesis by 1,2,4,5 benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride. Another class of such electronic conductors which has been found to be promising for use in the present invention comprises organic semiconductors wherein the fused polycyclic system is contained in a poly acene quinone polymer. Such polymers may be prepared by condensing, utilising a Friedel Crafts reaction, at least one substituted or unsubstituted acene, such as biphenyl, terphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, triphenylchloromethane, triphenylmethane, fluoranthene, perylene, dibenzypyrene and picene or a sandwich compound, such as ferrocene, with at least one substituted or unsubstituted polyacylated aromatic compound, for example a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic polycarboxylic acid, or a precursor thereof, for example the corresponding acid anhydride or acid chloride such as 1,2,4,5 benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, in the presence of excess Lewis acid, such as zinc chloride or aluminium chloride. The polyacylated compound preferably comprises pairs, especially two pairs, of acyl groups, or their precursors, attached to vicinal carbon atoms commensurate with each pair partaking in ring formation during the Friedel Crafts reaction. Poly acene quinone polymers have an electrical conductivity of ambient temperature from ca. 10 ⁸ to 10 ⁹ mho cm ¹. A further class of organic semiconductor suitable for use in the present invention comprises polymeric Schiff s Bases. These may be prepared by reacting polyisocyanates with quinones. They may also be prepared by analogy with the preparation of certain thermotropic polymers. See, for example, UK Patent No. 1545106. Aniline Black is such a polymer and may be prepared in known manner for example by oxidising aqueous aniline hydrochloride with sodium chlorate. These and other classes of suitable organic semiconductor are disclosed in J. Phys. Chem., The continuous phase of the electrorheological fluid of this invention may be any of the liquids previously indicated in this role. Desirable properties of such liquids are It will be clear that not all of these properties will, in general, be found in a given liquid. These need not, however, prevent the liquid from being used as the continuous phase of an electrorheological fluid thus, a liquid of significantly different density from the dispersed phase may still be in use in the formulation of a viable electrorheological fluid provided that when not in service the fluid is circulated to maintain the dispersed phase in suspension. Examples of very suitable continuous phase material include fluid hydrocarbons or those disclosed in our UK Patents Nos. 1501635 1570234 or UK Patent Application No. 2100740A and 2153372A. Halogenated aromatic liquids are particularly preferred continuous phase materials. The electrorheological fluids of this invention are prepared by simply comminuting the dispersed phase to the requisite particle size and then mixing the comminuted dispersed phase with the selected continuous phase. Loadings of as little as 5 In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an electrorheological fluid as aforesaid which is capable of developing a static yield stress of at least 0.5 kPa, for example from 1 to 3 kPa, preferably up to 5 kPa or more, under an applied electric field of no more than 3MVm ¹ when the fluid is dried as hereinbefore described. There is also provided an electrorheological fluid as aforesaid which is capable of passing a current density of no more than 40 Am ², under an applied electric field of no more than 1MVm ¹ when the fluid is dried as hereinbefore described. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In Figure 1, the yield point meter 1 comprises a conductive receptacle 2 for the electrorheological fluid 3 under test which receptacle also acts as a first electrode. Above the receptacle are positioned two horizontal parallel ground glass rods 4, polished With silicone grease, on which a second electrode 5 is slidably mounted. The gap between the two electrodes is 0.5 mm. A micrometer screw 6 is mounted to transmit effort to a third order lever 7 a portion of which is arranged as a beam 8 which is deflectable between the second electrode and pivot 9. This beam carries a strain gauge bridge 10 and its flexure is capable of being monitored by related recording instrumentation not shown . In use, the electrorheological fluid 3 to be determined is placed in receptacle 2 and the second electrode 5 is stationed on rods 4 over, and in contact with, the electrorheological fluid with a gap as aforesaid. The micrometer screw 6 is then rotated urging beam 8 to force the second electrode along the rods and thus through the fluid. The frictional resistance causes the beam 8 to deflect prior to slip. This maximum deflection is recorded graphically, the peak χ Absolute numerical values may be obtained by calibrating the yield point meter. This is effected by leaving the micrometer screw unaltered and instead applying effort to the second electrode 5 by adding a succession of differing loads, for example weights W. The area of the second electrode is 4 x 10 ⁴m² and thus the yield stresses, represented by χ, can be quantified from the quotient of applied load area. The following Examples illustrate the invention. A series of electrorheological fluids in accordance with the invention was prepared by incorporating different amounts of copper phthalocyanine In these Figures This Example illustrates the preparation of a series of poly acene quinone s and their formulation and testing as electrorheological fluids in accordance with the invention. Equimolar quantities of 1,2,4,5 benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride At the end of that time, the resulting polymer was filtered off and ground to a fine powder. The powder was then leached with dilute 2N hydrochloric acid for 24 hours to assist in removing zinc chloride. The leached powder was subsequently extracted with distilled, deionised water for 24 hours ethanol The poly acene quinone s were then dried at 50 C for 72 hours in a vacuum oven. After drying, the polymers which were black in colour were finely ground in a micronising mill and stored in a dessicator. The density of the poly pyrene quinone was found to be 1.51 g cm ³ that of the poly naphthalene quinone was 1.50 g cm ³. Different volume fractions, detailed below, of each polymer were dispersed in the 3 1 paraffin oil paraffin grease mixture described above, the viscosity of which permitted a stable dispersion of the polymer to be formulated. Different volume fractions, again detailed below, of each polymer were dispersed in a polychlorinated hydrocarbon CERECLOR 50 LV The dispersions were electrorheological fluids of the invention they were then tested in the yield point meter hereinbefore described the test results are depicted graphically in Figures 7 to 16 inclusive. In these Figures In each case, even in the absence of water, a yield stress was developed that developed from poly acene quninone s dispersed in chlorinated hydrocarbon being particularly noteworthy.
