# Multiwell tissue culture assembly with features for reduced media evaporation.

## Abstract
A multiwell tissue culture assembly 10 comprises a plate 12 and a list 14 . The plate includes a plurality of wells 15 for receiving liquids therein. Upstanding side walls 16 from the outside border of the plate. A ledge 22 is spaced inwardly of the side walls and extends around the plate between the side walls and the wells. The lid is removably positioned on the plate and includes a substantially planar cover extending over the wells. A labyrinth passage is associated with the cover, the side walls, the ledge and the wells to permit air exchange between the wells and the external environment to maintain equalibration therebe tween, but to partially prevent air entrance to the wells to minimize evaporation of liquids in the wells.
