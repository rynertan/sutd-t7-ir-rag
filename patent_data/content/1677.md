# Flux for soft soldering of aluminium, a fluxed solder composition containing said flux and a method of soft soldering aluminium using said flux.

## Abstract
Soft solders, namely solder alloys melting at a temperature below about 350 C., are generally preferred to the higher melting point hard solders and to the brazing and welding alloys for soldering a joint between a member made of aluminium or aluminium alloy and another member which may or may not be of aluminium or an aluminium alloy. However a disadvantage arising from this use of soft solders is that the corrosion resistance of such joints tends to be unsatisfactory. To deal with this problem, the invention provides a flux containing as one of the essential constituents thereof a silver halide which, when used in conjunction with a conventional lead tin soft solder alloy, ensures that silver is deposited at the joint interface to prevent corrosion.
