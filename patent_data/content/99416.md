## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkanolamines and, more particularly, to a continuous process for preparing alkanolamines with high yields of monoalkanolamine by the reaction of alkylene oxides with a large excess of ammonia wherein the reaction mixture is maintained in a single phase as a supercritical fluid. It is known that alkanolamines, which are used in a variety of commercial applications such as emulsification agents ror soaps and cosmetics and as a starting material for the production of raw materials for detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, textile auxiliaries and the like, can be obtained by the reaction of a lkyle ne oxides with ammonia or amines, the yield of alkanolamines being a mixture of mono di and trialkanolamine with, generally equal relative proportions of the three alkanolamines being frequently ootained.The relative proportions of these tnree alkanolamines in the product mixture, however, are known to depend on tne relative qudntities of alkylene oxide and ammonia that are reacted and processes have heretofore been used or suggested for achieving higher yields of one or more of the alkanolamines in the mixture which involve varying the proportion of such reactants, such is increasing the amount of ammonia relative to the alicylene oxide to ocain increased yields of monoalkanolamine, as well as by other process changes. There is disclosed, for example, in U.S. PatentNo. 2,196,554 to H. M. Guinot a process for preparing mono hydroxylalkylamines with yields of 90 95 by reacting at least 30 parts by weight of ammonia with one part of alkylene oxide in a liquid phase reaction.Relatively dilute aqueous ammonia solutions are employed and the patent discloses that steam generated during concentration of the reaction product mixture is used for heating subsequent reaction product mixtures to separate ammonia gas therefrom, thus reducing tne neat energy requirements for the process. Another process for preparing alkanolamines with extremely high yields of monoalkanolamines and only small amounts of the diand trialkanolamines oy reacting alkylene oxide witn large excess amounts of ammonia in a liquid phase reaction system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,697,598 to Weibull et al. The molar ratio of ammonia relative to alKylene oxide used in the process is within the range of 10 1 to 80 1 and the reaction is carried out in tne presence of a cation exchange resin catalyst. The process of the patent is described as being a continuous process whicn is capable of being run isothermally or, preferably, adiabatically at temperatures in the range of from 200C. to 250cm. when pressures are employed that are high enough to keep the reactants and reaction products in the liquid phase throughout the reaction.There is, however, no disclosure either in the description or in the examples of the patent which show that high yields of alkanolamines of any type are obtained when the process is carried out either adiabatically or isothermally without the use of cation exchange resin catalysts, and patentees state that without a cation exchange catalyst it is not possible to realize an adiabatic reaction because it is too slow. Further, in U.S. Patent No.3,723,530 to Goetze et al., there is also disclosed a process for preparing a mixture of alkanolamines by the liquid phase reaction of ethylene oxide and a large excess of ammonia, that is mole ratios of ammonia to ethylene oxide of from 14 to 40 to one. The patent teaches that when the reaction is carried out in tne presence of up to 1 mole of dietnanolamine per mole of ethylene oxide, the product obtained will be a mixture or only monoethanolamine and triethanolamine witn little or no diethanolamine being present. The process of the invention is described as being capaole of being run continuously, either isothermally or adiabatically.When operated continuously, the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase at temperatures in the range of from 60 to 1500C and pressures of from 20 to l20 atmospheres, and the monoethanolamine content of the product mixture generally does not exceed 70 percent by weight. A continuous embodiment of the process which is described as being preferred is directed to initially reacting ethylene oxide with an excess of ammonia in a liquid phase to prepare a mixture of alkanolamines from which diethanolamine is separated and recycled. The recycled dietnanolamine, when added to fresh ammonia ana ethylene oxide starting reactants in the proportions described, results in tne net formation of reduced amounts of diethanolamine.This process, however, requires the continuous separation of diethanolamine from the product mixture and is operated in the liquid phase. In copenoing application Serial No. 247061 filed March 24, 1981, there is disclosed a process for preparing alkanolamines with high yields of monoalkanolamines by reacting alkylene oxide with a large excess of ammonia in a single supercritical fluid phase. The process disclosed therein is described as being capable of running batchwise or continuously under isothermal or adiabatic conditions. When the process is run continuously, a reactor which is capable of operating as efficiently as possible as a wplug flow reactor may be employed for carrying out the reaction.The present invention is directed to preferrea emboaiments of the continuously run processes described in said copending application. SUGARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a continuous process for preparing alkanolamines with high yields of monoalkanolamine which comprises continuously reacting a flowing stream of a homogeneous mixture of an alkylene oxide having from two to four carbon atoms ana ammonia in a molar ratio of ammonia to alkylene oxide within the range from about 15 1 to about 50 1 maintained in a single supercritical fluid phase in a plug flow reactor at temperatures at which the reaction proceeds above about 1000C. ana at pressures high enough to maintain the reaction mixture in a single supercritical fluid phase having a density at least about 15 lbs cu.ft. 240 kg cu.m. for the time necessary to form an alkanolamine proauct mixture containing predominately monoalkanolamine. Unreacted ammonia may be separated from the proauct mixture and recycled while the alkanolamine product mixture is recovered, or the product mixture may be used in the preparation of further amine products, if desired. The temperatures employed for carrying out the reaction are preferably as high as possible so that the reaction will proceed at a suitable rate and temperatures above the critical temperature of the reaction mixture may be advantageously used. The pressure should be high enough to maintain the reaction mixture in a single nomogeneous pnase as a supercritical fluid at any point during the reaction. The density of the supercritical fluid reaction mixture is an important consideration as to the rate at which the reaction proceeds and should be maintained as nign as possible throughout the reaction and generally at least about 15 lbs. cu. ft. 240 kg cu.m. . Tne reaction can be carried out under isothermal or, preferably adiabatic conditions and, while no catalyst is required, tne presence of a small amount of water in the reaction mixture nas an advantageous catalytic effect. The term supercritical fluid as used herein is defined as the physical state of tne reaction mixture wherein eitner the pressure or both the temperature and pressure conditions are above tne critical values therefor.Tne term plug flow reactor as used herein is defined as a reactor in which there is no mixing of a stream of fluids in the direction of the flow thereof through the reactor. Suc plug flow reactors may oe non adiabatic tubular or adiabatic pipe. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process of the invention comprises continuously reacting a homogeneous flowing stream of a mixture of alkylene oxide having from two to four carbon atolls and ammonia in a molar ratio or ammonia to alkylene oxide within the range from about 15 1 to about 50 1 which is maintained in a single, homogeneous phase as a supercritical fluid at temperatures at which the reaction proceeds above aoout 1000C. and at pressures high enough to maintain the reaction mixture in a supercritical fluid phase having a aensity of at least 15 lbs cu.ft. for the time necessary to form a product mixture compcsed predominately of monodlkanolamine generally about 75 and small amounts of di and trialkanolamine.If desired, unreacted ammonia can be separated from said product mixture at the completion of the reaction with alkylene oxide and recyclea wnile tne alkanolamine product mixture is recovered. The mono , di , and trialKanolamines can also De separatea, if desired The product mixture, including unreacted ammonia, may also be used in the preparation of other amine products. The alicylene oxides to which the process of tne present invention is applicable is any alkylene oxide having from two to four carbon atoms, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1,2 butylene oxide, 2,3 butylene oxide, and isobutylene oxide. In accordance witn the present invention, it is essential that a large excess of ammonia relative to the alkylene oxide is used in the reaction to obtain yields of monoalkanolamines of at least 65 weight percent. It is advantageous to use from about 15 to about 50 moles, and preferably from about 20 to about 35 moles, of ammonia for each mole of alkylene oxide to obtain yields of monoalkanolamine in many cases of from about 70 to 85 weight percent. It is essential that the reaction of alkylene oxide and ammonia be carried out in a homogeneous, single supercritical fluid pnase se tnat tne reaction will proceed at a suitable rate. The reaction can be carriea out under isotnermal or, preferably, adlaDatic conditions. The temperature at which the reaction should be carried out is witnin the range from about 1000C. to about 2000C., though the upper limit of the temperature is not critical. Preferably, the reaction temperature is within the range from about the critical temperature of tne reaction mixture generally from about 1300C. to about 1800C. Under isothermal conditions, since tne reaction is strongly exotner nic, it is necessary t withdraw heat from the reaction mixture to keep the temperature approximately constant. In the case when the reaction is to be carried out under adiaDatic or nearly adiabatic conditions, the reactants are preheated, preferably to a temperature in the range from about 1000C. to about 1600C., before they are introduced into the reactor. Because of the reaction heat involved, any selected initial reaction temperature rapidly increases and the initial reaction temperatures should be chosen so that the maximum desired temperature will be obtained during the period of residence of the reaction mixture within the reactor. The preferrea maximum temperature is between about 1700C, and 1800C., though the higher the reaction temperature, the higher the pressure that is necessary to maintain the density of the reaction mixture as high as possible. At sucn reaction temperatures, it is essential that the pressures imposed on the system are high enough to maintain tne reaction mixture in a single supercritical fluid phase. In any case, the reaction pressure should be at least as nigh as tne critical pressure of the reaction mixture at any point encountered during tne process. Preferably, tne pressures imposed on the system are within the range from about 170 to about 240 atmospheres. Tne latter is a practical upper limit and is not critical. As pointed out nereinabove, it is important that the reaction mixture is maintained in a single homogeneous phase as a supercritical fluid and that che density thereof is as high as possible so that the reaction will proceed at a suitable rate. Tne density of the reaction mixture should be above its critical density and, in general, at least 15 los cu. ft. 240 kg cu.m. . Preferably, the density of the reaction mixture should be maintained in the range of from about 21 to about 28 lbs cu. ft. or even higher, if practical. The mole ratio of the ammonia and alkylene oxide reactants and the reaction temperature have a significant effect on the density of the reaction mixture.It is important, therefore, that the reaction pressures are maintained as high as is practical so that tne reaction mixture is not only maintained in a single supercritical fluid phase but that the density of said mixture is as high as possible. While it is not essential that the process of the invention be carried out in the presence of any catalyst, advantageous embodiments of the process of the invention may oe carried out with a small amount of water incorporated in the reaction mixture along with the alkylene oxide and ammonia reactants. It has been found that the presence of small amounts of water in the reaction mixture has an advantageous catalytic effect on the reaction rate for forming alkanolamines though it does not appear to affect tne yield of monoalkanolamine in the product mixture. The amount of water that is present is not critical, and only small amounts of water will achieve the catalytic affect that may be desired. In general, from about 0.5 percent to about 5 percent by weight of water based on the weight of the reaction mixture may be present. Amounts of water greatly in excess of that which may be catalytically useful, however, snould be avoided to limit the energy requirements needed to separate water from the product mixture. In accordance with the present invention the process may be carried out continuously under isothermal or, preferably, adiabatic conditions in a plug flow reactor or series of reactors which have a small cross section in comparison to their length. A turbulent plug flow reactor allows for tne unidirectional flow of a process stream of reactants that minimizes back mixing axial mixing within the reactor. The reactor may be provided with heat exchange means to maintain the temperature of the flowing reaction mixture at desired levels but such temperature control means would not be needed if the reaction is carried out under adiabatic conditions. In the continuous reaction process of the invention, a liquid mixture of the ammonia and alkylene oxide reactants in the molar ratios hereinabove described, preferably with a small amount of water admixed therewith, is preheated and then fed to the reactor through an inlet section therein where a swirling motion is imposed on the feed stream. When a tubular reactor non adiabatic is employed, the reaction may be controlled to proceed within a relatively narrow temperature range such as, for example, about 200C. though the temperature of tne feed mixture may be varied over a wide temperature range, such as, for example, from about 200 to about 1000C.Under adiabatic conditions, the mixture of reactants should be preheated to a temperature, from between aDout 1000C to about 1600C, so that the maximum desired reaction temperature generally from about 1700 to 2000 will be attained during the period of residence of the reaction mixture within the reactor or series of reaCtors. The pressure within the reactor shall be high enough so that the reaction mixture is maintained in a single, homogeneous phase as a supercritical fluid having the highest possible density at any point within the reactor. The throughput rate of tne reaction mixture should be chosen to provide a residence time within the reactor or reactors sufficient to permit the reaction to proceed to completion, generally less than about 1 2 hour. In an adiabatic reactor having the inlet feed configuration herein described, a velocity of from about 0.15 to about 0.5 feet second or even higher of the fluid stream may be advantageously employed to permit plug flow operation. At the completion of the reaction, that is generally when all the alkylene oxide has been reacted, the unreacted ammonia can be separated from the product mixture by means known in the art, such as by reducing the pressure on the product mixture to below that at which the ammonia is in a gaseous phase or by distilling unaer pressure, and the alkanolamine product mixture may be recovered.The unreacted, separated ammonia can then De recyclea, if desired, by repressurizing or condensing to a liquid state prior to mixing with tresh altylene oxide. Tne alkanolamlne analogues in the product mixture may also be separated by known distillation methods. Tne product mixture obtained during the continuous reaction process may also be used without further treatment as a starting material for the preparation of other organic amines. The present invention will De further described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a schematic showing of a typical adiabatic reaction system for use in the invention. Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of an adiabatic plug flow reactor suitable for use in the invention. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawing, liquid ammonia and alkylene oxide are blended in the proportions herein described in the feed pipe 1. Small amounts of water may also be added, if desired. The mixture of reactants is pumped tnrougn line 2 to a preheater 3 where the mixture is heated to a temperature in the range from about 1000C to about 1600C and tnen fed through an axial inlet pipe 4 to the adiabatic reactor. The adiabatic reactor may be a single plug flow reactor or, as shown, a series of plug flow reactor stages Sa, Sb, and Sc, each of which has an axial inlet pipe. Means are provided for imposing a swirling motion on the reaction mixture feed stream entering each reactor stage to minimize thermal stratification therein witnout increasing axial mixing.The pressure within each of the reactor stages is maintained in the range, in general, from about 170 to 240 atm by a pressure control valve 6 so that the reaction mixture stream is in a single supercritical fluid phase at any point within the reactor and has a density of at least 15 lb cu. ft.. The number of reactor stages employed may vary depending on the amount of product to be produced, the total length of reactor required to achieve the desired production rate, the feasible length for any reactor stage, and similar considerations. A typical system may comprise from 1 to 6 reactor stages of up to 100 feet or more in length with 3 to 5 reactor stages being generally advantageously employed. The product mixture in which all or substantially all of the alkylene oxide has been converted to alkanoiainines is fed from tne last adiabatic reactor stage Sc through pressure control valve 6 and line 10, where the product mixture stream is depressurized to between about atmospheric pressure and 40 atm, and then fed immediately into a flasn separator 11. In the flash separator 11 a substantial amount of the unreacted ammonia rapidly separates from tne product mixture as a gas which escapes at the top of the separator 11 in gaseous form and is recycled via line 12 through a compressor or condensor 13. The alkanolamine product mixture is drawn from tne bottom of tne separator 11 througn line 14 for refining, if desired. Fig. 2 illustrates an adiaDatic reactor 5 typical of the reactor stages 5a, Sb, or Sc of Fig. 1 having an axial inlet pipe 4 into a generally cylindrical hollow body 7 having a small cross section in comparison to its length which defines an internal, longitudinally extending passageway. Mounted within the inlet end 20 thereof are a pair of opposed, semielliptically shaped baffles 21 which impose a swirling motion to the reaction mixture fed there through to achieve a swirling plug flow regime for the reactor.Intermediate the inlet pipe 4 and the opposed baffles 21 in the inlet end 20 of said reactor 5 is mounted a perforated plate 8 which serves to distribute and straighten the flow of fluid entering the cylindrical body 7 of said reactor 5. The semi elliptically shaped baffles 21 which impose a swirling motion to the flowing stream of fluid within the reactor may be prepared from semi elliptic plates having ratios of major to minor axis of from about 1.25 1 to about 2.0 1.Other means for imposing a swirling motion to the flow of fluid tnrough the reactor may also be used such as, for example, baffles with varying configurations, spacing, numbers, size, and metnod of mounting within the inlet end of the reactor, the cross section and length of the reactor, the velocity of flow through tne reactor and the like being factors which must be considered in choosing the particular configuration desired. In a typical embodiment of the processs of the invention, liquid ethylene oxide and ammonia in a molar ratio of ammonia to ethylene oxide of 30 1 are blended in feed pipe 1 along with 3 percent by weight of water.The mixture of reactants is pumped through line 2 to a preheater 3 where the mixture is heated to a temperature of about 1300C. and then fed to adiabatic plug flow s reactor stage 5a, a reactor having an outer diameter of 30 inches and a length of 100 feet at a velocity of 0.3 ft, sec. The reaction mixture is subsequently fed at such velocity to 3 successive adiabatic plug flow reactor stages of similar dimensions and inlet configuration. The pressure in the reactor stages is controlled by pressure control valve 6, high enough to maintain the reactant mixtures in a single, homogenous phase as a supercritical fluid having a density of 24 lbs. cu.ft. at any point therein, generally about 200 to 210 atmospheres.After a total residence time in the reactor of about 25 to 30 minutes, the product mixture exits from the last reactor stage at a temperature of about 1750C. and is fed through pressure control valve 6 and line 10 to flash separator 11. Tne product mixture passing through line 10 is depressurized to about 20 atmospheres and when the product mixture enters the flash separator 11, unreacted ammonia is rapidly separated tnerefrom and exits from tne top of the separator through line 12. The unreacted ammonia is then condensed to a liquid in conaenser 12 and recyclea. The alkanolamine product mixture is fed from tne bottom of separator 11 through line 14, refined by known distillation techniques and recovered. This invention will become more clear when considered together with the following examples which are set fortn as being merely illustrative of tne invention and which are not intended in any manner, to be limitative tnereof. Unless otherwise inaicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 A reaction system and apparatus similar to that shown in the drawing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 except that the adiabatic plug flow reactor is comprised of 4 reactor stages, each of which are 30 inches in diameter and 100 feet long, was used in a continuous run in which ethylene oxide was reacted with ammonia. In this run a liquid ethylene oxide feed of 5000 pounds per hour was mixed with a liquid ammonia water mixture feed of 90,000 pounds per nour 96 percent NH3, 4 percent water to give an ammonia to ethylene oxide mole ratio of 45 1.The mixed ammonia and ethylene oxide feed was preheated to a temperature of about 1500C. and then pumped into the rirst reactor stage at a velocity of about 0.27 feet sec. The pressure in the reactor stages was controlled to maintain the flowing stream in a single supercritical fluid phase having an average reaction mixture density of about 21.5 lbs. cu.ft. The pressure at the outlet of the final reactor stage was about 2700 psig about 184 atm. and the temperature of tne product mixture at the outlet of the fourth reactor stage was about 1700C. after a residence time witnin the reactor stages of 28 minutes.The product mixture from the final reactor stage was depressurized to about 400 psig 27 atm. in the line leading to a flash tank separator and substantially all the unreacted ammonia separated from the product mixture in the flash tank separator.The separated ammonia COMMAND 001 from tne top of the separator and passed through a condenser where it was condensed to a liquid ana then was recycled. The product mixture was recovered from the bottom of the flash tank separator, refined to remove the small amount of unreacted ammonia that was entrained therewitn, and then collected. Tne composition of the product mixture was determined by gas chromatographic analysis to contain 80 percent by weight of monoethanolamine, 17.5 percent by weight of diethanolamine, and 2.5 percent by weight of triethanolamine. No measurable amount of unreacted ethylene oxide was found. EXAMPLE 2 Using the reaction system and apparatus ofExample 1, a continous run was made in which a liquid ethylene oxide feed of 5200 pounas per hour was mixed with a liquid ammonia water mixture feed of 90,000 pounds per nour 97 percent NH3 and 3 percent water to give an ammonia to ethylene oxide mole ratio of 44 1. Tne mixed ammonia and ethylene oxide feed was preheated to a temperature of about 1540C. and pumped into the first reactor stage at a velocity of about 0.26 ft. sec. The pressure in the reactor stages was controlled to maintain te flowing stream ot reactants in a single supercritical fluid phase having an average reaction mixture density of about 22.5 lbs. cu.ft.The pressure at the outlet of the final reactor stage was about 3000 psig l204 atms. and the temperature of tne product mixture at the outlet of the final reactor stage was about 174.50C. after a residence time of 29 minutes. The temperature of the reaction mixture at the outlet of each of the reactor stages was found to be at the outlet of the first reactor stage 166 C. at the outlet of the second reactor stage 169.60C. at the outlet of the third reactor stage 174.80C. The product mixture from the final reactor stage was depressurized to about 400 psig and fed to a flash tank separator where substantially all the unreacted ammonia rapidly separated from the product mixture and was then taken from the top of the separator, condensed to a liquid and recycled. The product mixture recovered from tne bottom of the separator was collected and determined to have the following composition 83 percent by weight monoethanolamine 15 percent by weignt diethanolamine 2 percent by weight triethanolamine No measurable amount of unreacted ethylene oxide was found in the product mixture. EXAMPLE 3 Using the reaction system and apparatus ofExample 1, a continous run was made in which a liquid ethylene oxide feed of 10,000 pounds per hour was mixed with a liquid ammonia water mixture feed of 114,000 pounds per hour 97.5 percent NH3, 2.5 percent water to give an ammonia to ethylene mole ratio of 29 1. The reactant mixture was preneated to a temperature of about 1500C. and pumped into the first reactor stage at a velocity of 0.33 ft. sec. Tne pressure in tne reactor stages was controlled to maintain the reactant mixture in a single supercritical fluid pnase having an average reaction mixture density of about 23 lbs. cu.ft. The pressure at the outlet of the final reactor was about 3,000 psig 204 atms. and the temperature of the product mixture at the outlet of tne final reactor stage was about 1800C. after a residence time of 23 minutes. Analysis of the product mixture after separating unreacted ammonia was determined to be 76.2 percent by weight of monoethanolamine 20.8 percent by weight of diethanolamine 3.0 percent by weight of triethanolarnine It was also determined that 0.1 percent unreacted ethylene oxide was present in the product mixture.
