# Process for the preparation of polymeric tertiary aralkyl isocyanates from 1,3 or 1,4 bis 1 chloro 1 methylethyl benzene.

## Abstract
A process for forming useful oligomers and higher ho mopolymers of 1,3 or 1,4 bis 1 chloro 1 methyl ethyl benzene is disclosed which comprises polymerizing a 1,3 or 1,4 bis 1 chloro 1 methylethyl benzene and an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cyanate in a solvent for the organic reactant and the substantial absence of a catalyst at temperatures of between about 15 C. and about 60 C. until formation of the oligomers and homopolymers is substan tially complete. The oligomers and homopolymers produced are related to poly TMI type polymers and are useful together with active polyurethane coating and or injection moldable compositions.
