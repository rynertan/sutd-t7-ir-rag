# Shock absorbing struts for aircraft landing gear.

## Abstract
Shock absorbing struts 10 for use on aircraft landing gear which include a pair of fluid containing chambers 14, 16 defined by a pair of telescoping cylinders. Fluid flows from one of the chambers to another through a metering orifice 24 proportional to the differential in pressure generated by impact loads created upon landing or taxiing of the aircraft. Upon the differential pressure exceeding a predetermined threshold level an additional flow path 22, 26 positioned in parallel to the metering orifice 24 is opened by an amount proportional to the amount of differential pressure in excess of the threshold to thereby maintain a substantially constant load on the landing gear irrespective of impact loads imparted thereto.
