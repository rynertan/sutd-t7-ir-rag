# Polymer article having an antibacterial property containing zeolite particles therein and the processes for producing same.

## Abstract
A polymer article containing zeolite particles on which metal ion having a bactericidal property, e.g. Ag, Cu or Zn, is provided by an ion exchange reaction shows an excellent bactericidal effect and durability of the efffect, but no deterioration of physical properties of the polymer. The polymer article is produced by admixing zeolite particles previously provided with the metal ion with a polymer or by moulding a zeolite containing polymer into an article and then treating the article with a metal ion solution.
