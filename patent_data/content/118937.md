# A pressure regulating system.

## Abstract
A pressure regulating system with amplifier is provided for preparing the mixture of a gas with air for a combustion engine. The pressure regulating system comprises a first 9 and second 14 inlet conduit opening in a first chamber 13 through which gas is supplied under constant pressure. The first inlet conduit 9 is separated from the first chamber by a valve 12 connected to a diaphragm 10 . The second inlet conduit 14 comprises an adjustable restriction 15 , through which a constant small quantity of gas being delivered to the first chamber 13 . The pressure regulating system also comprises an outlet conduit 31 being directly connected to the first chamber 13 and to the inlet of the user and a second chamber 23 being separated from the first chamber by said diaphragm 10 . To said second chamber 23 a third inlet conduit 16 , provided with an adjustable restriction 19 , is connected, through which a constant small quantity of gas is delivered to the second chamber. The second chamber 23 is also connected to the first chamber i.e. outlet conduit, through a variable restriction 18 .
