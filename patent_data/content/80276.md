## Description
AZOCARBOXYLIC ESTERS USEFUL AS POLYMERISATION INITIATORS This invention relates to novel organic azo compounds which are useful as initiators for the polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The use of organic azo compounds as initiators in the polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers is well known and extensively described in the literature. Illustrative of such compounds are 2,2 azo bis 2 methylpropionitrile , 4,4 azobis 4 cyanopentanoic acid , 2,2 azobis 2 cyanoethyl p benzoic acid , 4,4 azobis 4 cyano n pentanol , 2,2 azobis 4 amino 2, 4 dimethylvaleronitrile and l,l azobis l cyanocyclohexane . According to the present invention there are provided azo carboxylic esters having the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is the residue of an aliphatic monohydroxy compound after the removal of the hydroxyl group therefrom,R1 is a methyl or ethyl group or a grouping of the formula COO CnHZnO R R2 is a methyl group or a ss carboxy p ethyl group and R3 is a methyl group or an ethyl group, orR2 and R3 together with the intermediate carbon atom form a cyclohexyl group R4 is a methyl group and R5 is a methyl group, an ethyl group, a ss carboxyethyl group or a ss meth oxy ssss dimethylethyl group, or R4 and R5 together with the intermediate carbon atom form a cyclohexyl group n has the value 2, 3 or 4 and p is an integer from 2 to 100 more particularly from 2 to 50. The ester moiety of the compounds I is thus derived from a poly alkyleneoxy condensate of the hydroxy compound R OH. The poly alkyleneoxy chain may consist entirely of ethyleneoxy units, or of propyleneoxy units or of butyleneoxy units, or it may include units of any two or all three of these types. Furthermore, in the latter case, the different units may be arranged randomly within the chain or they may occur in blocks.Examples of such hydroxy compounds include the monomethyl ether of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 250, in which R is CH3, n is 2 and p is approximately 5 the monomethyl ether of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 2000, in whichR is CH3, n is 2 and p is approximately 45 the random condensate of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with methanol in the approximate molar proportions 24 6 1, with a molecular weight of 1450 1750, in which R is CH3, n is 2 and 3 and p is approximately 30 and the monomethyl ether of diethylene glycol, in which R is CH3, n is 2 and p is 2. The esters of the invention may be obtained from the corresponding azonitrile by a two step process in the first step, the nitrile is subjected to the Pinner reaction with the appropriate compound R OH in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas under anhydrous conditions to form the intermediate iminoether hydrochloride, and in the second step the iminoether hydrochloride is hydrolysed to yield the required carboxylic ester. According to the known procedure, the Pinner reaction of a nitrile is conducted using a stoichiometric excess of the alcohol and, in suitable cases, the iminoether hydrochloride then precipitates out and is separated from the reaction mixture.However, the intermediate isolation of the iminoether salt may prove difficult where the alcohol is, as in the present case, a poly alkyleneoxy compound. We have found that, in these specific circumstances, the amount used of the compound in question may be limited to that which is stoichiometrically equivalent to the nitrile groups present in the azonitrile. The conversion of the azonitrile to the iminoether is substantially quantitative.and it is possible to proceed directly to the hydrolysis step without isolation of its hydrochloride. This procedure is the subject of, and is more fully described in, our co pending Application i√ßo. 8134919. Azonitriles from which the azoesters of the invention may be derived include the following which are commercially available 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile 2,2 azobis 2 methylbutyronitrile , 4,4 azobis 4 cyanopentanoic acid , l,l azobis l cyanocyclohexane , 2 2 methylpropan 2 azo 2 cyano 4 methoxy 4 methylpentane, 1 2 methylpropan 2 azo 1 cyanocyclohexane, 1 2 methyl butan 2 azo 1 cyanocyclohexane, 2 2 methylpropan 2 azo 2 cyanopropane and 2 2 methylpropan 2 azo 2 cyanobutane. Azo carboxylic esters according to the invention are valuable as free radical forming initiators for the polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers.According to their physical properties, they may be especially suitable for specific polymerisation procedures.Thus, certain members of the class are preferentially soluble in organic media and are liquid at ordinary temperatures, and are consequen.ly very convenient for initiating polymerisation of monomers in bulk or in solution their liquid nature much facilitates their measuring and dispensing into the polymerisation mixture. An example of such a compound is that already mentioned which is derived from 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile and in which the ester moiety in formula I is derived from a random condensate of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with methanol in the molar ratio 24 6 1. Certain other members of the class are, in contrast, preferentially soluble in water and are therefore useful in polymerisations carried out by aqueous emulsion techniques.An example of such a compound is that already mentioned, again derived from 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile , in which the ester moiety in formula I is derived from the monomethyl ether of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 2000. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 The monomethyl ether of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 1950 238 g, 1 molar equivalent was dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene and then dissolved in dichloromethane 300 ml. . 2,2 Azobis 2 methylpropionit rile 10.01 g, 0.5 molar equivalent was added and dry hydrogen chloride gas was passed through the solution with cooling and stirring, keeping the temperature below about loot. After about 8 hours, the solution had absorbed about 30 g of hydrogen chloride and was saturated. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stand at rcom temperature for 168 hours. Infra red examination of the mixture at the end of this period indicated almost complete absence of the characteristic CrN band at 2250 cm l. After the reaction mixture had stood at room temperature for a total of 264 hours, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was poured into cold water about 200 ml. and extracted with dichloromethane about 200 ml. The organic phase was separated, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulphate and then concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The product was a white, waxy solid which was soluble in water it was also soluble in methyl methacrylate but, in the presence of both water and methyl methacrylate, it was preferentially soluble in the water phase.When examined by infra red spectroscopy it exhibited a characteristic ester grouping peak at 1735 cm l there was no peak observable at 2250 cm l, indicating the absence of nitrile groups. Thin layer chromatography of the product and of the parent monomethylether of polyethylene glycol demonstrated that the two compounds were readily separated and distinguished there was no evidence of contamination of the product with this starting material.It was concluded therefore that the product was substantially the ester of polyethylene glycol l950 monomethylether and 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropanoic acid , as represented by the following formula EMI5.1 EXAMPLE 2 The condensate of methanol 1 mol with a mixture of ethylene oxide 24 mols and propylene oxide 6 mols 123g, 0.07 mol. was dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene and then dissolved in dichloromethane 300g. , 2,2 Azobis 2 methylpropionitrile 5.74g, 0.035 mol was added and dry hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled into the cooled and stirred reaction mixture, keeping the temperature below about loOC. After about 15g of hydrogen chloride had been passed, the solution was saturated.The mixture was then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 days, following which the solvent and hydrogen chloride were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was stirred with water 200 ml and extracted with dichloromethane. Removal of the solvent from the extract under reduced pressure gave a colourless liquid which was insoluble in water.Examination of the product by infra red spectroscopy indicated complete absence of nitrile groups the product was concluded to be substantially the ester of the methanol ethylene oxide propylene oxide condensate and 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropanoic acid , as represented by the formula EMI6.1 EXAMPLE 3 The monomethyl ether of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 250 50g, 0.2 mol was dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene and dissolved in dichloromethane 100 ml .2,2 Azobis 2 methylpropionitrile 16.4g, 0.1 mol was added and dry hydrogen chloride gas was passed into the stirred and cooled solution until it was saturated, keeping the temperature below about loOC, After the reaction mixture had stood at room temperature for 7 days, the solvent and hydrogen chloride were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was added to water 100 ml and extracted with dichloromethane 150 ml . The extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow liquid which was soluble in methyl methacrylate but only very slightly soluble in water.It was an efficient emulsifier for methyl methacrylate water mixtures. Examination of the product by infra red spectro scopy revealed a strong characteristic ester group absorption and absence of any nitrile group absorption. When subjected to thin layer chromatography, the product exhibited a single streak which migrated differently from the monomethyl ether of the polyethylene glycol. The product was concluded to be substantially the ester of polyethylene glycol 250 monomethyl ether and 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropanoic acid as represented by the formula EMI7.1 EXAMPLE 4 Dry diethylene glycol monomethyl ether 52.2g, 0.44 mol. and 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile 36.lg,0.22 mol were together dissolved in dichloromethane loo ml .Dry hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled through the cooled and stirred solution until it was saturated about 15g of hydrogen chloride had been passed at this stage ., and keeping the 0 temperature below about 10 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 days and the solvent and hydrogen chloride were then removed under reduced pressure. The residue was poured into cold 10 aqueous potassium hydrogen carbonate 150 ml and stirred. After 10 minutes, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane 2 portions of 100 ml and the extract concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was a yellow liquid which subsequently solidified to form needle shaped colourless crystals. Infra red spectroscopic examination of the product showed a strong ester group absorption and an absence of nitrile group absorption. The product was very slightly soluble in water, but soluble in methyl methacryl ate. It was concluded to be substantially 2,2 azobis 3,6 oxaheptyl 2 methylpropanoate , as represented by the formula EMI8.1
