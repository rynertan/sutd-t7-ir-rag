Abstract

## Description
The invention is concerned with a new use of 2 proparglyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptaneThe expression 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane used in this disclosure comprises both the racic and the optically active forms of this compound bless otherwise stated. 2 Propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane heptopargil is a compound known from US patent 4,244,888 for use as a plant regulator, for example, also for rice and sorghum, which promotes the plant growth and increases the yield of crops also its use for the seed treatment for this purpose having been mentioned. The compound 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one is a known herbicide for use in controlling weeds, primarily grasseous weeds in various crops, for example, soybeans and potatoes. This compound is known primarily as a pre emerbent herbicide, e which is applied at or before planting for post emergent wed control. The usual method for the application e such compounds is to apply them to or incorporate them in the soil in which seeds or seedlings are or are about to be planted. The problem underlying to the invention is to create the use of a compound by which rice and sorghum effectively can be protected against the herbicide 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one. Surprisingly the above has been attained by the invention. Surprisingly it has been determined that when using 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane as an antidotum with regard to the herbicide 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one to rice and sorghum, particularly to seeds of them prior to planting them, the former drastically protects the rice or the sorghum, respectively from damage by the latter on account of the phytotoxic effects of it. Rence the subject matter of the invention is the use of 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.Ijheptane as an antidotum with regard to the herbicide 2 I2 chloro phenyl5 methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one for the protection of rice and sorghum against damage by the said herbicide. The use according to the invention comprises that of the racemic and or optically active form s of it. The above is all the more surprising since the protective effect with the 2 propargyloxyinino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.llheptan occurs only to a slight degree with other agricultural useful crops1 for example, cotton, and has not been noticeable with regard to other herbicides. The use according to the invention is preferably a treatment of rice or sorghum seeds, respectively. In doing so t is preferred that the treatment of rice or sorghum sees, respectively, is carried out with at least 0.03 by weight, particularly 0.03 to 0.7o by weight, above all 0.03 to 0.25 by weight, of the 2 propargyl oxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane, based on the weight of the untreated rice or sorghum seeds, respectively.It is particularly preferred to carry out the treatment of rice or sorghum seeds, respectively, with C.36 to G.5 t by weight, above all 0.06 to 0.25 by weight, of the 2 propargyl oxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane, based on the weight of the untreated rice or sorghum seeds, respectively. Suitably the use according to the invention is carried out as coating the seeds with the 2 proparagyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane. The 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane may be present dissolved in a solvent, such as acetone, prepared with 1 or more other inert and or active ingredient s or as such together wit n an adhesive agent suitable for retaining the 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane on the seeds during handling and planting and may be applied in such forms to the seeds. Beyond these preparation and application forms all other known ones are possible. The following specific experiments have been carried out with the racemic form of 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane but analogous results have been achieved with the optically active forms of it. From the following tables I and Ii results the protective effect of 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane with regard to 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 5 one on rice Labelle cultivar . Prior to planting rice seeds were coated with the 2 propar gyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane by stirring a weighed amount of seeds in an acetone solution containing the calculated amount of a 50 by weight emulsifiable concentrate of 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane and letting evaporate the acetone. The amount of 2 propargyloxyimino 1 ,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane applied ranged from 0.031 by weight to 0,250J o by weight based on the weight of the seeds.After having planted the seeds 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one was sprayed as an aqueous emulsion on the surface of the soil at rates of 0.125, 0.250 or 0.500 kg ha,respectively. As a comparative test, also flats of seeds which had not received a 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane coating prior to planting were treated with the same rates of 2 2 chloro phenyl methyl 4,4 di methyl isoxazolidin 3 one. Also seeds treated with 2 propargyloxyimino 1,7,7 tri methvl bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane were planted in flats which were not treated with the said herbicide. 3 weeks after treatment in all experiments the vigor of the surviving plants and the percentage of the plants which had been killed were determined.The Biological Effectiveness was calculated from these values according to the following equation Biological Effectiveness Wo Kill X 100 Kill , in which X was determined according to the following criteria.
