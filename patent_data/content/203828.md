## Description
This invention relates to epoxy resin compositions. In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of curing epoxy resin compositions to cured resins having high T Epoxy resins are monomers or prepolymers that react with curing agents to yield high performance resins. These resins have gained wide acceptance in protective coatings, electrical insulation, structural adhesives, and in structural applications as a matrix resin for composites because of their combination of characteristics such as thermal and chemical resistance, adhesion and abrasion resistance. Epoxy resins are characterized by the presence of a 3 member cyclic ether group commonly referred to as an epoxy, 1,2 epoxide or an oxirane group. The epoxy resins are cured, or caused to harden, by the addition of a curing or hardening agent. Curing agents used include anhydrides, amines, polyamides, Lewis acids, salts and others. The most common class of epoxy resins are diglycidyl ethers that are cured by the use of polyamino compounds. Epoxy resins are frequently required to have high glass transition temperatures in order to have structural properties at high temperatures. A method of achieving high glass transition temperatures in epoxy resins is to prepare resins having high crosslink density and a high concentration of polar groups. This technique is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,331,582 where it is taught that bis 4 N,N diglycidylamino phenyl methane TGDDM is cured with di 4 aminophenyl sulfone DDS . While this method does produce resins that have high glass transition temperatures, the resins have several shortcomings. The materials are very brittle and suffer a large loss in glass transition temperature when exposed to moisture. These problems are caused by the high crosslink density and high concentration of polar groups respectively. DDS can also be used to cure other epoxy resins such as glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols. Again while these resins may be characterized by high glass transition temperatures, they also tend to be very brittle. Epoxy resin compositions in which the epoxy group containing compound contains a polycyclic structure are known that can be cured to resins having a high glass transition temperature. Examples of such resin compositions among others are the glycidyl ethers of polyhydroxy phenylchroman disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,902,471 and the bisglycidyl ethers of polycarbocyclic substituted bisphenols, e.g., 2 norcamphanylidene diphenol, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,298,998 the bisglycidyl ethers of cyclopentenyl substituted bisphenols disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,332,908. Although these compositions can be cured to resins having a high glass transition temperature, the cured resins are highly crosslinked and have low ductility and, compared to the cured resins of the instant invention, have a relatively high water absorption. Also known are epoxy resin compositions, in which the curing agent or hardener contains a polycyclic struc ture, that can be cured to resins having a high glass tran sition temperature. Examples of such resin compositions are those in which the curing agent is an aromatic can be diphenyl polyamine in which the amino groups are primary or secondary such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,397,177, a dicyclohexyl polyamine as is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,963,667 a phenylindane diamine such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,983,092 the tricyclic and pentacyclic polyamines having 2 to 4 primary and 1 or 2 secondary aminoalkyl groups as are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,229,376 and the cycloaliphatic polyamines described in U.S. Patent No. 4,321,354. Although many of these compositions can be cured to resins having a high glass transition temperature, the cured resins are highly crosslinked, have low ductility, and, compared to the cured resins of the instant invention, have a short shelf life and may have a relatively high water absorption. Thermoplastic resins having a high glass transition temperature, i.e. above about 120 C, are known to be obtainable by incorporating into the resin an internal or pendent polycyclic structure. Examples of such resins are the polyamides disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,143,530 and in U.S. Patent No. 3,287,321 polyimides described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,358,582 and 4,366,304 the polyesters of U.S. Patent Nos. 3,546,165 and 4,388,455, among many other patents. Other resins having internal or pendent polycyclic structure are discussed by Korshak et al., J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem., It is seen from the above that many epoxy compositions can be cured to resins having a high glass transition temperature. Generally, this has been done by use of a curing agent that brings about a high degree of crosslinking of the epoxy composition which has led to a corresponding increase in brittleness of the resultant cured resin. It is believed that few if any curing agents in the prior art provide cured resins having a combination of high glass transition temperature, high ductility and low moisture pick up. The resins of the prior art have either high glass transition temperature and relatively low ductility by reason of a high degree of crosslinking or high ductility and relatively low glass transition temperatures by reason of low crosslinking of the cured resin. Further, it is known in the art that epoxy resins compositions which are cured resins that have a high glass transition temperature and high moisture pick up will generally undergo a reduction of glass transition temperature and strength upon absorption of moisture. Briefly, the present invention provides a thermally curable epoxy resin composition which on curing provides cured resins having a high glass transition temperature and a low degree of moisture pick up. The cured resin does not exhibit a substantial reduction in glass transition temperature upon absorption of moisture. The epoxy resin composition does not cure at room temperature i.e., it is latent but at elevated temperatures cures to a resin having high ductility and a high glass transition temperature. There are also provided novel 9,9 bis aminophenyl fluorene curing agents for use in the epoxy resin compositions, a process for curing epoxy resin compositions, and the cured resins produced by the process. The epoxy resin composition comprises Universal agreement on the terminology to be used in the field of epoxy resins has not been reached. The term epoxy resin has been used to indicate not only any molecule containing at least one group having a three membered ring of which one member is oxygen but also both the uncured and cured compositions containing such a molecule. Within this application, the term polyepoxide means a molecule that contains more than one The process aspect of the invention comprises the steps of 1 mixing the aromatic polyepoxides and the curing agent or agents and catalysts as described below to form a substantially uniform mixture and 2 heating the mixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to cure the composition. While the curing reaction may take place slowly at room temperature, it preferably is brought about by heating the mixture at 50 C to about 300 C for a period of time from about one to about 18 hours or more. It is desirable to bring about cure by heating the mixture in cycles such as, for example, 50 to 150 C for 0.25 to 1.0 hour, 150 to 200 C for 0.5 to 2.0 hours, and 175 to 250 C for 1.0 to 5.0 hours. Aromatic polyepoxides required in the epoxy resin composition of the invention are well known. The aromatic polyepoxides are compounds in which there is present at least one aromatic ring structure, e.g. a benzene ring, and more than one epoxy groups, e.g. Examples of aromatic polyepoxides, useful in the epoxy resin composition of the invention, include the polyglycidyl derivatives of polyhydric phenols such as 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane and those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,018,262 and 3,298,998, incorporated herein by reference and in Handbook of Epoxy Resins by Lee and Neville, McGraw Hill Book Co., New York 1967 . A preferred class of poly glycidyl ether s of polyhydric phenols of use in the compositions of the invention are the diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol that have pendent carbocyclic groups such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,298,998, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of such diglycidyl ethers are 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl norcamphane and 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl decahydro 1,4,5,8 dimethanonaphthalene. A much preferred diglycidyl ether is 9,9 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl fluorene. Examples of N glycidylaminobenzenes suitable for use in the epoxy resin composition of the invention include the di and polyglycidyl derivatives of benzenamine, benzene diamines, naphthylenamine and naphthylene diamine such as N,N diglycidylbenzenamine, N,N diglycidylnaphthalenamine given the name of N 1 naphthalenyl N oxiranylmethyl oxiranemethanamine by The curing agent of use in the composition of the invention comprises at least one 9,9 bis aminophenyl fluorene, the phenyl and benzo groups of which can be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more atoms or groups that are inert to reaction with an epoxide group. Preferably the cured composition of the invention absorbs less than 3 weight percent moisture, has a fracture energy of at least 100 J m² Joules per square meter , and a Tg of at least 160 C. Preferably, the curing agent has general formula I The thermally curable epoxy resin compositions of the invention comprise one or more aromatic polyepoxides which preferably are poly glycidyl ether s of polyhydric phenols and one or more 9,9 bis aminophenyl fluorenes. The aromatic polyepoxide composition comprises from 0.1 to 1.1 amino groups, NHR, present in the 9,9 bis aminophenyl fluorenes, as defined above, per epoxide group of the aromatic polyepoxide and, optionally, a sufficient amount of a conventional epoxy resin curing agent also called hardener such as a polyamino group containing compound and or a conventional epoxy resin curing catalyst as are well known in the art. A preferred curable epoxy resin composition of the invention comprises With different ratios of the secondary amino groups to primary amino groups i.e., where R² is hydrogen in the curing agent , the characteristics of the cured epoxy resin can be varied. Thus, the glass transition temperature, T The use of combinations of fluorene containing diprimary and disecondary amines is preferred and allows the preparation of a family of cured epoxy resins having a variety of properties. The expected effect is that as crosslinking is increased greater amounts of primary amine the glass transition temperature will increase while the ductility of the resin will be decreased. However, with fluorene containing curatives even samples cured with only disecondary amines still have high glass transition temperatures. The diprimary amines, preferably fluorene containing diprimary amines, may be added to tailor resin properties for specific applications. In addition to increasing the glass transition temperature, properties such as solvent resistance and creep will be enhanced by increasing the level of primary amine. Even though the resistance to fracture may be decreased, the fracture energy of specimens prepared with fluorene containing diprimary amines is higher than most conventional cured epoxies. Also the moisture resistance is higher than epoxies prepared with other primary amine curatives. The addition of increasing amounts of the fluorene containing epoxy resin has the effect of increasing the glass transition temperatures of cured specimens, while not detracting from resistance to fracture or other desirable properties. The stoichiometric ratio of fluorene to aromatic polyepoxide can also be used to control the crosslink density of the cured epoxy composition. Resins having reduced crosslink density are desirable because they are exceptionally ductile and can be rubber toughened by the addition of a rubbery heterophase which is described below . Recently we have found that this effect can also be achieved by using a stoichiometric excess of a hindered fluorene containing diprimary amine. Apparently the diprimary amine is incorporated into the network sequentially. The first NH of the primary amine is significantly more reactive than the second NH. The consequence of this is that when these amines are used to cure an epoxy resin the reaction of the first NH occurs rapidly resulting in a linear structure having the remaining primary amine NH reoccurring along the polymer backbone. The remaining NH groups then react to form a tightly crosslinked network if the stoichiometric ratio of NH to epoxy is nearly equivalent. However, if the ratio of NH to oxirane becomes greater than 1 the crosslink density becomes proportionally reduced. Essentially, NH groups are left along the polymer backbone with nothing left to react with. This essentially has the same effect as using a mixture of primary and secondary amine curing agents. Many useful formulations using this overcharge principle may have a ratio of amino groups to oxirane as high as 1.1. Another preferred curable epoxy resin composition of the invention comprises Examples of the curing agents of Formula I of the invention are 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 4 methyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 4 chloro 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 ethyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 iodo 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 3 bromo 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9 4 methylaminophenyl 9 4 ethylaminophenyl fluorene, 1 chloro 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 methyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2,6 dimethyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 1,5 dimethyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 fluoro 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 octafluoro 9,9 bis 4 amino phenyl fluorene, 2,7 dinitro 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 chloro 4 methyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2,7 dichloro 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 acetyl 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 2 methyl 9,9 bis 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene, 2 chloro 9,9 bis 4 ethylaminophenyl fluorene, 2 t butyl 9,9 bis 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene. Preferred curing agents of Formula II are bis secondary aminophenyl fluorenes or a mixture of the bis secondary aminophenyl fluorenes and a primary aminophenyl secondary aminophenyl fluorene. Poly glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols when cured with such secondary amines or mixtures thereof possess not only a high glass transition temperature, T Preferred curing agents of Formula III are sterically hindered bis primary aminophenyl fluorenes. When such hindered amines or mixtures of such hindered amines with the above described secondary amines are used as the curing agent epoxy resin compositions comprising poly glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols, the compositions have a thermal stability or latency of at least three weeks and cure to cured resins having a high glass transition temperature and a water pick up of less than about 3 percent by weight. Examples of the preferred hindered amines include 9,9 bis 3 methyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3 ethyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3 phenyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9 3,5 dimethyl 4 methylaminophenyl 9 3,5 dimethyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9 3,5 diethyl 4 aminophenyl 9 3 methyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 1,5 dimethyl 9,9 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 methylamino phenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 diisopropyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3 chloro 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 dichloro 4 aminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 diethyl 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene, 9,9 bis 3,5 diethyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene. It is to be noted that the aminophenylfluorenes described herein are currently named by The primary and secondary aminophenylfluorenes are prepared by procedures known in the art by the conden sation of a primary or secondary aniline or substituted primary or secondary aniline or mixture of such anilines and fluorenone or substituted fluorenones having the formula Preferably, the secondary aminophenylfluorenes of Formula II are prepared by heating to a temperature in the range of 125 to 150 C a mixture on a mole basis of one mole of fluorenone or substituted fluorenone of Formula IV, 5 to 10 moles of N alkylaniline or substituted N alkylaniline, and 0.1 to 3.0 moles of concentrated hydrochloric acid or other strong acid, and removing distillate as long as water distills while maintaining the reaction mixture at 125 to 150 C. A period of time of from about 4 to 10 hours is generally required. At the end of this time, the mixture is cooled to about 90 C and about 2.5 moles of a tertiary amine is added preferably triethylamine in 100 to 150 moles of a water soluble solvent such as ethanol. From this mixture, the secondary aminophenylfluorene crystallizes. Mixtures of aminophenylfluorenes as the curative in the epoxy resin compositions of the invention may be preferred in certain applications. Such mixtures may be preferred because they generally have a melting point that is lower than the melting point of an individual aminophenylfluorene and allow for the curing of the epoxy resin composition at a temperature lower than can be done by a high melting individual compound. The mixture of aminophenylfluorenes are conveniently prepared by the reaction of fluorenone with a mixture of anilines under the aforementioned conditions. When preparing hindered primary aminophenyl fluorenes from fluorenone, it is generally desirable not to remove the water produced in the condensation reaction. An undesirable side reaction is the reaction of the aniline NH₂ group with the carbonyl group of fluorenone to form an imine. When water is left in the reaction this quickly reverts back to the primary amine and ketone. It is desirable that this reaction of a hindered primary aminobenzene and fluorenone be carried out at 140 to 200 C in a closed vessel under pressure to retain the water formed in the reaction medium. The introduction of additional water into the reaction mixture is generally favorable to the formation of the desired product. Conventional epoxy resin curing agents can be used as supplementary curing agents in the curable epoxy resin compositions of the invention. Included among such supplementary curing agents are aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines as, for example di 4 amino phenyl sulfone, di 4 aminophenyl ether, and 2,2 bis 4 aminophenyl propane, aliphatic and aromatic tertiary amines such as dimethylaminopropylamine and pyridine, boron trifluoride complexes such as BF₃ diethylether and BF₃ monoethanolamine, imidazoles such as 2 ethyl 4 methyl imidazole, hydrazides such as adipodihydrazide, guanidines such as tetramethyl quanidine, and dicyandiamide. Also useful as supplementary curing agents are Lewis acids such as aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, boron trifluoride, antimony pentafluoride, phosphorous pentafluoride, titanium tetrafluoride and the like. It is also desirable at times that these Lewis acids be blocked to increase the latency of compositions containing them. Representative of blocked Lewis acids are BF₃ monoethylamine and the adduct of HSbF₅X in which X is OH, halogen, or OR⁸ in which R⁸ is aliphatic or aromatic group with aniline or a hindered amine as is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,503,211. Yarious adjuvants can also be added to the composition of the invention to alter the characteristics of the cured composition. Included among useful adjuvants are thixotropic agents such as fumed silica pigments to enhance color tones such as ferric oxide, brick dust, carbon black, and titanium oxide fillers such as silica, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and beryllium aluminum silicate clays such as bentonite glass beads and bubbles reinforcing material such as unidirectional woven and nonwoven webs of organic and inorganic fibers such as polyester, polyimide, glass fibers, polyamide fiber such as poly p phenylene terephthalamide Kevlar , E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co. Inc. , carbon fibers, and ceramic fibers. Amounts of up to about 200 parts of adjuvant per 100 parts of epoxy resin compositions can be used. A particularly desirable adjuvant is a rubber heterophase that is introduced into the epoxy resin composition. The rubbery heterophase can be introduced as a latex of dispersed natural or synthetic rubber as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,316,195 or a graded rubber or core shell rubber particle as is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,833,683 3,856,883, and 3,864,426. The rubbery heterophase can also be introduced into the epoxy resin composition by dissolving reactive elastomers into the epoxy resin which phase separate during curing. The technique is exemplified by U.S. Patents Nos. 4,107,116 and 3,894,112. A detailed discussion of the use of rubbery heterophase in epoxy resins is to be found in the Advances in Chemistry Series 208 titled Rubbery Modified Thermoset Resins edited by C. K. Riew and J. K. Gillham, American Chemical Society, Washington, 1984. A preferred rubbery heterophase is the insoluble The compositions of the invention are useful in protective coatings for various articles such as appliances, for impregnating and embedding materials for electrical components, for composite articles of woven or nonwoven webs impregnated with the composition of the invention, and other uses where the operating temperature of the article or material is elevated. The compositions of the invention are of particular use because of their unique handling properties and their high temperature performance in structural composites, filament wound articles, pultruded articles, film adhesives, printed wiring boards and the like. Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. In the examples all parts and percents are by weight and tempera tures are in degrees centigrade unless otherwise noted. In certain of the examples, the fracture energy of cured resins is given. This is determined using a variation of the compact tension specimen as described in ASTM E 399 83, Standard Test Method for Plane Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, vol. 03.01 1983 . The test specimens in these examples were cut to 2.54 cm 2.54 cm 0.318 cm 1.00 in. 1.00 in. 0.125 in . Results are calculated to joules per square meter, J m². Into a 500 ml 3 necked flask equipped with a Dean Stark trap and means for flooding with nitrogen were placed 22.5 g fluorenone 94.0 g N methylaniline 18.0 g concentrated hydrochloric acid. A stream of nitrogen was introduced and the flask and its contents heated to 140 C. These conditions were maintained for 8 hours during which time water and condensate that collected in the Dean Stark trap were removed. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 90 C and poured into a solution of 19 g triethyl amine in 350 g ethanol. The solution that was obtained was cooled to 10 C and held at this temperature for 16 hours. The white crystals which formed were filtered off and washed with cold ethanol until the effluent was colorless. The white crystals obtained were vacuum dried at 100 C for 16 hours. There was obtained 35 g of pure white crystals melting at 200 201 C. Analysis by NMR spectroscopy indicated that the crystals were bis 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene. Into a 500 ml pressure vessel the following ingredients were placed 18.0 g fluorenone 107.0 g 2 methylaniline 5.6 g methanesulfonic acid The vessel was sealed and heated to 175 C for 24 hours. The water formed in the condensation reaction was retained in the vessel throughout the reaction. The vessel was cooled and its contents poured into 1 liter of methanol containing twenty grams of triethyl amine. The white crystalline product was filtered and washed with methanol until the effluent was colorless. 32 grams of a crystal melting at 228 230 C was recovered and identified by NMR spectroscopy analysis as 9,9 bis 3 methyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene. Into a 500 ml 3 neck flask equipped with a Dean Stark trap and means for flooding with nitrogen were placed 18.0 g fluorenone 69.6 g N methylaniline 32.6 g aniline 9.6 g methane sulfonic acid. A stream of nitrogen was introduced and the flask and its contents were heated to 140 C. These conditions were maintained for 8 hours during which time water and condensate were collected in the Dean Stark trap. The reaction mixture was cooled to 90 C and poured into a solution of 12 g triethyl amine in 350 grams of ethanol. The solution was cooled to 10 C and held at this temperature for 16 hours. The white crystals were filtered off and washed with copious amounts of cold ethanol until the effluent was colorless. 26 grams of a mixed product melting at 189 194 C was recovered. Liquid chromatographic analysis indicated the product was by weight 79.5 of 9,9 bis 4 methylaminophenyl fluorene, 20.1 9 4 methylaminophenyl 9 4 aminophenyl fluorene, and 0.4 9,9 bis aminophenyl fluorene. This product was designated as Curative A. The procedure of Example 2 was repeated using the ingredients 20.0 g fluorenone 142.5 g 2 chloroaniline 5.3 g methanesulfonic acid There was obtained 35 g of a crystalline material melting at 196 198 C identified by NMR spectrometry as 9,9 bis 3 chloro 4 aminophenyl fluorene. Twenty five grams of the compound prepared in Example 1 was mixed into twenty five grams of 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane which had an epoxy equivalent weight of 187. A uniform dispersion was prepared with the aid of a paint mill. The mixture was then cured by heating to 150 C for 30 minutes and 177 C for 210 minutes. The resulting specimen was a clear ductile material having a glass transition temperature of 168 C and 1.3 weight percent water pick up following immersion in water at 95 C for 14 days. The material had a tensile strength of 54.4 MPa 8000 PSI and elongation of 12 . The material was a linear polymer in that it was 99 weight Percent soluble in tetrahydrofuran. Gel permeation chromatography GPC analysis of the product indicated that it had a number average molecular weight of 30,000, based on a polystyrene standard. Into each of five containers, designated a , b , c , d and e , was added 65 grams 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane DGEBA 0.371 equivalents of oxirane and 35 grams 9,9 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl fluorene DGF 0.147 equivalents of oxirane . To these containers was added the amounts of BAF and Curative A as shown in Table I below. The contents of each container was thoroughly mixed and then cured by heating in an oven at 150 C for 1 2 hour and then at 177 C for 4 hours. The cured resins were removed from the oven, allowed to cool, and cut into samples of suitable size for testing. The results of these tests are recorded in TABLE I below. The data of Table I show that an epoxy resin composition cured by the known curing agent, bis primary amino phenyl fluorene, BAF, has a fracture energy of 110 J m² and that as an increasing amount of the bis secondary amino phenyl fluorene, Curative A, is used, the fracture energy increases to 319 J m². This great increase in fracture energy is brought about with an accompanying reduction of water pick up from 2.2 to 1.5 . For comparison, a conventional epoxy resin, bis 4 N,N diglycidylamino phenyl methane, TGDDM, when cured with an equivalent amount of di 4 aminophenyl sulfone, DDS, had a fracture energy of 65 J m², a Tg of 220 C, a water pick up of 6.0 and a wet T Into each of three containers was placed 16 parts BAF and 58 parts of Curative A i.e. 65 of the active hydrogens in the mixture was provided by Curative A, and 35 of the active hydrogens was provided by the diprimary amine, BAF . The appropriate amount of epoxy resins, as indicated in Table II, was added to each container. The contents of each container was mixed, cured, and the resulting cured resins tested as described in Example 5. The results are recorded in TABLE II below. The data of Table II show that when cured with a bis secondary aminophenyl fluorene curing agent of the invention the water pick up remains low and the fracture energy remains high for epoxy resin systems containing up to 50 of the epoxide groups provided by DGF. Without the bis secondary aminophenyl fluorene curing agent but using conventional curing agents, the T Twelve and one half grams of 9,9 bis 3 methyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene 0.14 NH equivalents , prepared as described in Example 2 was mixed with 25 grams of DGEBA 0.14 oxirane equivalents and cured as described in Example 5. The resulting specimen was a clear highly crosslinked polymer having a glass transition temperature of 218 C and a water pick up of 2.2 . Twenty five grams of DGEBA was mixed with stoichiometric amounts of the aminophenylfluorenes as shown in Table IV. A uniform dispersion was prepared as described in Example 5. A two milligram sample of each mixture was placed in a Differential Scanning Calorimiter DSC II, Perkin Elmer Co. and heated at a rate of 10 C per minute. The exotherm maximum was noted and recorded in Table IV. The data of Table IV show that the composition of the epoxy resin DGEBA and the unhindered aminophenyl fluorene, f has an exotherm temperature of 176 that corresponds to a latency for the mixture of less than two weeks at 25 C and the composition of the epoxy resin DGEBA and hindered aminophenylfluorenes, a , b , c , d , and e have an exotherm temperature of 21 to 69 C higher corresponding to a latency of three weeks or longer at 25 C. Into a liter beaker was placed 65.0 g DGEBA 0.37 equivalents of oxirane , 35.0 g 9,9 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl fluorene 0.15 equivalents of oxirane , 30.3 g 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene 0.34 equivalents of NH , 30.8 g Curative A 0.18 equivalents of NH 125.0 g methyl ethyl ketone. The mixture was sonicated for twenty minutes to provide a uniform dispersion. Ten 10 cm 15 cm pieces of graphite fabric having a plain weave construction consisting of 3000 filament continuous Hercules AS4 fiber were dipped into the resin dispersion to obtain a uniform coating. The coated fabric was allowed to dry in a fume hood for one hour and then heated in an oven at 90 C for ten minutes to remove solvent. Each piece of coated fabric or prepreg had a resin content of approximately 50 by weight. Nine of the coated fabric prepregs were layed up and cured in a mini autoclave according to the cure cycle The composite laminate was machined into specimens for DMA and flexural testing. Table V shows the results. Similar results can be obtained when the graphite fabric is replaced with Kevlar or glass fibers. The data of TABLE V show that with graphite fibers the compositions of the invention provide composite laminates possessing excellent mechanical properties, even at elevated temperatures. Also, the laminates have a high resistance to moisture absorption and show little loss in the glass transition temperature after exposure to moisture. Into each of ten containers was added by weight 65 grams of 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane, DGEBA, 0.37 equivalents of oxirane and 35 grams of 9,9 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl fluorene, DGF, 0.15 equivalents of oxirane and as indicated in TABLE VI, the corresponding amounts of BAF, Curative A, and polytetra methylene oxide diprimary amine PTMO number average molecular weight of 7500 as a rubber toughening agent. Each container contained a stoichiometric mixture of epoxy resin to Curative A and BAF curing agents. The contents of each container were thoroughly mixed and deaerated, then cured in sheet molds by heating in an oven at 150 C for 1 2 hour, 177 C for 1 hour, and 200 C for 3 hours. The cured resins were allowed to cool, removed from the oven and machined into samples for compact tension CT evaluation and dynamic mechanical analysis DMA . The evaluation results are reported in TABLE VI below. 1 Equal to 10 by weight of total epoxy resin and curing agent. The data of TABLE VI reveal that the incorporation of a rubbery heterophase into the fluorene containing resins produced a substantial increase in fracture energy. There could be as much as a tenfold increase as is the case for the formulation containing largely Curative A. However even the highly crosslinked formulation, 100 BAF, achieved more than a threefold increase in fracture energy after rubber toughening. The increase in fracture energy was accompanied by a minor loss in T Twelve beakers were charged with the amounts of epoxy resin and PTMO rubber toughening agent as shown in TABLE VII. Then, to all twelve beakers was added the stoichiometric amount of a curing mixture containing 0.65 equivalents of Curative A and 0.35 equivalents of 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene BAF . Each composition was thoroughly mixed and deaerated, then cured by heating in an oven for 1 2 hour at 150 C, 1 hour at 177 C, and 3 hours at 200 C. The cured resins were allowed to cool, removed from the oven, and machined into specimens for compact tension CT testing and dynamic mechanical analysis DMA . The results are shown in TABLE VII. The data in TABLE VII reveal that increasing levels of the rubbery heterophase produced an enormous increase in fracture energy with only a minor depression in T Into each of two containers, designated a and b , was added by weight 100 parts DGEBA. To a was added 46.5 parts of BAF and to b was added 33 parts DDS. The curatives were dispersed into the epoxy resin with a high shear mixer. The specimens were cured by heating in an oven at 150 C for 1 2 hour, 177 C for 3 hours, and 200 C for 1 hour. The following table summarizes the properties of the cured resin. Into each of three beakers labeled a , b and c was placed 100 parts by weight 0.58 epoxide equivalents of 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane DGEBA and 64.8 parts by weight 0.38 equivalents of Curative A. To beaker a was added 17.9 parts by weight 0.20 equivalents of 9,9 bis 4 aminophenyl fluorene BAF . To beaker b was added 18.9 parts by weight 0.20 equivalents of 9,9 bis 3 methyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene. To beaker c was added 26.4 parts by weight 0.20 equivalents of 9,9 bis 3,5 diisopropyl 4 aminophenyl fluorene. The contents of each beaker was thoroughly mixed, deaerated, and then cured by heating in an oven at 150 C for 1 2 hour and then 177 C for 4 hours. The cured resins were allowed to cool, removed from the oven, and cut into samples on which the glass transition temperature, water absorption and fracture energy were measured. The results these tests are recorded in TABLE VIII. As shown by the data in TABLE VIII, cured epoxy resins in which the bis aminophenyl fluorene curing agents of the invention are used have high glass transition temperatures and fracture energy and low water absorption whether the curing agent is unhindered sample a or hindered samples b and c . Into each of seven containers 100 grams of 2,2 bis 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propane Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI was placed. Varying amounts of 9,9 bis 3 chloro 4 aminophenyl fluorene, CAF, was used as the curative. In selected samples acrylic core shell material Acryloid KM 653 , Rohm Hass Corp. which provided a rubber heterophase was added to rubber toughen the sample. TABLE IX presents the compositions and physical properties of these formulations. The data of TABLE IX show that as the NH epoxy ratio increases from 1 1 to about 1 1.7 the percent water absorption generally decreases and the fracture energy increases. Rubber toughening the sample has substantial effect in increasing the fracture energy.
