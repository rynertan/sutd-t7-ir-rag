# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPERATING A DOOR

## Abstract
A power operated canopy type up and over garage door comprises an electric motor connected through a high ratio reduction drive and two torque transmitting shafts to the lower ends of the radius or mounting arms of the door. The motor unit applies torque directly between the door itself and the mounting arms whereby the door can be opened and closed under the control of the usual remote control actuating systems.
