# Air jet loom.

## Abstract
An air jet loom is equipped with a weft inserting nozzle through which a weft yarn is picked under a traction force of an air jet ejected therefrom. The loom is provided with a weft picking system which is so controlled as to accomplish a weft picking under the traction force at a first level during normal loom operation while increasing the traction force to a second level not lower than the first level for a predeter mined time at starting of the loom, thereby preventing shortpick at the loom starting.
