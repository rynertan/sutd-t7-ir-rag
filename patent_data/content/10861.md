# System for protecting an offshore structure.

## Abstract
When explosive fuels such as hydrocarbons are pump ed into or out of a barge or tanker 1 , a metallic conduit 2 having an insulated flange F 1 therein is typically connected to the barge. The system 10 of this invention involves connecting the barge to the earth E through a barge grounding cable 3 , connecting the metallic conduit to the earth through a conduit grounding cable 4 , where by a grounding test circuit 7 is established with a current source 40 connected between the earth and the ground ing cables. A flange resistor 35 is connected across the insulated flange to form a flange circuit 8 . The currents I₁ and I₂ flowing through the grounding cables are being continuously monitored in the grounding circuit to deter mine the presence of a broken cable or of an ineffective electric contact. A continuity test is also being made of the flange insulation in the flange circuit. A plurality of sensing relays 21 26 are operatively coupled to the grounding test circuit and to the flange circuit for sensing the currents flowing in the grounding test circuit and in the flange circuit. The sensing relays are operatively intercon nected through suitable switching means with an alarm circuit 10 having warning devices 13 18 which indi cate safe and dangerous operating conditions.
