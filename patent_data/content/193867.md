# HEAT SOURCE CIRCUITRY FOR BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL ANALYSIS

## Abstract
A circuit for providing stored electrical energy to a heat source for a limited duration. The heat source is adapted to convert the stored electrical energy into a quantity of heat upon receipt of a triggering signal, the triggering signal being developed when material to be heated is moved to a position adjacent the heat source. The circuit has particular application in instrumentation used to analyze biological material, where the heat source accurately heats the material to a predeter mined temperature prior to analysis.
