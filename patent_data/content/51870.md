# Information transferring apparatus.

## Abstract
Information transferring apparatus comprising memo ry means for storing first data of n bit length transferred from a transmitting section, means for transferring second data of m bit length transferred from the trans mitting section which follows the first data to a data transfer path of a m n bit length, and means for transferring the first data stored in the memory means to the data transfer path simultaneously with the second data. The second data is transferred to the data transfer path without being temporarily stored in the memory means, unlike the first data.
