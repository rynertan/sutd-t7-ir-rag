# PRE ORIENTED MONOFILAMENT YARN MANUFACTURE PRE ORIENTED MONOFILAMENT YARN MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for manufacturing monofila ment yarn of synthetic material, in which spinning material 3b is hot extruded through a spinneret 2a and downward ly through a cooling chamber 4 in which cooling air A is directed at the material 3b to form it into filamentary form. Monofilament yarn is taken up on a take up device 9a , and a spin finish oil emulsion is applied to the extruded material via nozzles 6 at a position close to the take up device 9a . The take up speed of the monofilament yarn is at least 4000 m min, and this factor, in combination with the close arrangement of the nozzles 6 to the take up device, enables monofilament yarn of the pre oriented type to be obtained using otherwise conventional equipment of the type suitable for producing multifilament yarn, modified to carry out the process of the invention. The position of the nozzles 6 is at a spacing of between 2500 and 6500mm below the spinneret 2a .
