# Line spacing device for a typewriter.

## Abstract
The line spacing device comprises an electric motor 26 arranged to rotate selectively in a clockwise direction and anticlockwise direction a control disc 21 carrying a pawl 31 on an eccentric 29. The tooth 32 of the pawl describes a closed trajectory engaging in the teeth of the wheel 14 and of a sense the same as the rotation of the disc 21, whereby the paper support platen 12 is rotated by one increment in the opposite sense. A central control unit controls the clockwise and anticlockwise rotations of the electric motor. A cam 28 disengages a detent pin 16 from the wheel 14 so that the motor is only lightly loaded when actuating the platen.
