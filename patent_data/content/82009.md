# Hemostat with blood flow sensor.

## Abstract
A hemostat 10 for restricting blood flow through a blood vessel for assisting hemostasis. An ultrasonic sensor 21 is mounted with a pressure pad 20 to sense rate of blood flow through the vessel when pressure is applied to obtain minimum bleending with maximum flow through the vessel, without need for continual observation. The output signal of the sensor 21 may be connected to an auditory signal unit 1 79 or a visual 39 display to free personnel from the site to perform other necessary tasks.
