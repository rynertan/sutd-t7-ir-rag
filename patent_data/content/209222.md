# Multiple wavelength operating lasers.

## Abstract
A multiple wavelength operating laser 10 having a pump cavity or enclosure 14 surrounded by an optical pumping arrangement 17 comprises a plurality of substantially concentric tubes 21A, 21B each having windows for emission of radiation and enclosing respective bodies of liquid lasing media. The lasing media may be flowed through the respective tubes and are preferentially arranged so that the fluorescence spectra of the lasing medium in one tube overlaps the absorption spectra of the lasing medium in the adjoining tube so that the one lasing medium optically pumps the other lasing medium in addition to optical pumping from the optical pumping arrangement 17 .
