# Improvements relating to electrophotography.

## Abstract
A method of forming an image on an electrophoto graphic film material is described. This involves a contact printing technique and comprises the following steps a placing an image bearing master in contact with the film b exposing the film to light through the image bearing master, the exposure being substantially greater than the minimum necessary to render conductive the photo conductive layer of the electrophotographic film c applying a substantially uniform charge to the surface of the film in the dark immediately after exposure d leaving the film in the dark for a short time so as to allow the charge to migrate selectively and e then developing the image.
