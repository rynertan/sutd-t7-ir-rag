# ELECTRICAL APPARATUS

## Abstract
An electrical apparatus for monitoring electrical con tinuity includes a number of input circuits 10,20 ... 60 each associated with a respective arm A1, A2 ... A6 of a multi phase rectifier circuit the continuity of which is to be monitored. Each input circuit 10, 20 ... 60 includes a comparator 12, 22,... 62 which generates a train of pulses P while an input current a
