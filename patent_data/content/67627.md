# Fire resistant materials.

## Abstract
A fire resistant material comprising a network of bonded expanded polystyrene beads having an organic or inorganic impregnant material incorporated in the interstices in the network so as to provide a reticulated impregnant structure which is retained upon destruction of the network of bonded expanded polystyrene beads, for example in a fire, and the structure retained upon removal of the polystyrene. The preferred impregnant material is a layer mineral, especially chemically delaminated vermiculite.
