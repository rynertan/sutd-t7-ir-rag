# Face mask.

## Abstract
A face mask 10 formed from a single porous sheet made of a plurality of fibers into a generally cup shape shell that fits over the mouth and nose of the wearer and is held thereto by elastic straps 15 . The mask filters breathed air passing there through. The border 13 of the mask is more tightly com pacted during forming. The mask features rearwardly extend ing projections 16 , preferably an arctuate ridge, on either side of the nose bridge area parallel to and close to the border of the mask. The peaks of the rearwardly extending projec tions 16 extend from the face mask in the direction of the face of the wearer to conform the portion of the mask close to its border to the contours of the face between the bridge of the nose and the upper areas of their cheekbones. The more tightly compacted rearwardly extending projections 16 , rib elements 12 and the border 13 cooperate to provide shape retention and a spring action that holds the mask firmly but comfortably to the face of the wearer even when they talk or change facial expression to prevent the passage of air be tween the mask and the face.
