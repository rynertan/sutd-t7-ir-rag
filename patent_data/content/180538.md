# Solid electrolyte fuel cell and method for preparing it.

## Abstract
A solid electrolyte fuel cell which comprises many unit cells 1 each having a structure in which there are laminated a gas permeable oxygen electrode made from an electron conducting material, a solid electrolyte 14 consisting of a CeO₂ 1 x CaO x x 0.05 to 0.8 binary system or a third component containing CeO₂ 1 x CaO x x 0.05 to 0.8 sys tem and a gas permeable fuel electrode made from an elec tron conducting material on a gas permeable support 3 , many unit cells being connected to each other in series with interconnectors by subjecting end portions of the electro lytes to a masking treatment or the like. A solid electrolyte fuel cell further provided with a com bustion opening for preheating oxygen or air, possibly covered with a filler. A solid electrolyte fuel cell which comprises many unit cells each in which a solid electrolyte consisting of cerium oxide or zirconium oxide dissolvingly containing a divalent oxide or a trivalent oxide of an alkaline earth metal other than calcium or a rare earth element is laminated on opposite sides or an anode side of a solid electrolyte consisting of cerium oxide or zirconium oxide dissolvingly containing cal cium oxide. A solid electrolyte fuel cell in which a composition of the electrolyte is varied in the direction of its membrane thick ness to heighten hydration resistance. A method for preparing a solid electroyle for a fuel cell by means of flame spraying or plasma flame spraying. And a solid electrolyte fuel cell which comprises many unit cells each in which a stabilized zirconia system solid electrolyte or a ceria system solid electrolyte containing an additive in such an amount or more as to exhibit a maximum value of conductivity is laminated on an anode side of a fun damental electrolyte, and a ceria system solid electrolyte is laminated on a cathode side thereof to form the solid elec trolyte having two or more layers.
