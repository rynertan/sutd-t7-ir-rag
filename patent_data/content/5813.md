# Suspension polymerization process.

## Abstract
There is presented a new process for producing homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl and vinylidene halides by means of the suspension polymerization procedure. In this new process, the reactor is run a few degrees warmer than normal for the first part of the reaction and then followed by a steadily decreasing temperature throughout most of the rest of the polymerization in order to linearize the reaction rate. This allows one to charge more initiator and or monomer to the reactor thereby increasing productivity per unit of time.

## Description
SUSPENSION POLYMERIZATION PROCESS BACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION When making homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl and vinylidene halides by means of the aqueous suspension polymerization procedure, these polymerizations are exothermic and display a steadily increasing heat load.Frequently, this heat load becomes so severe late in the polymerization that the isothermal control is lost and the reaction tailpeaks , or its temperature rises significantly above its set point. This tailpeak limits the amount of initiator and monomer, or monomers, which can be charged to the reactor, and therefore, limits the productivity of the reactor. A number of different methods have been heretofore proposed to overcome the difficulty of tailpeaks. In the prior art it has been suggested to polymerize at one temperature for a certain period of time and then change the temperature. This does not solve the problem. Elaborate computer techniques have been proposed. However, computer equipment may be expensive and difficult to install.Accordingly, a simplified process for ramping the temperature during a polymerization reaction is greatly desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION I have found that homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl and vinylidene halides can be produced with increased efficiency if the temperature is controlled carefully throughout the reaction cycle. The present invention involves temperature programming of suspension polymerization to substantially linearize the reaction rate profile as a function of time. This temperature programming enables the use of higher catalyst concentrations with higher percentage of conversion than that of the isothermal charges in the same length of time. This results in increased productivity of polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In accordance with the present invention, during the suspension polymerization of any polymerizable ethylenic ally unsaturated monomer or monomers the temperature is gradually reduced during the course of the reaction in order to linearize the reaction rate profile as a function of time. The important thing is to have as constant a reaction rate as possible throughout the course of the polymerization reaction. Normal suspension polymerization reactions are isothermal, that is they are operated under conditions of constant temperature and are marked by changes of volume or pressure. Isothermal polymerizations show a steadily increasing reaction rate with conversion, usually resulting in such a high heat load late in the polymerization that the isothermal control is lost and the reaction tailpeaks, that is, the reaction rate increases very rapidly.Under isothermal conditions, the average rate of reaction may be only 70 of that of the peak, so that during most of the reaction some of the heat removal capability goes unused. However, by temperature programming and linearizing the reaction rate, this average can be pushed to 80 or higher. While the present invention is specifically illustrated hereinafter with regard to the suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride, it is to be understood that the process may likewise be applied in the suspension polymerization of any polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers. Examples of such monomers are other vinyl halides and vinylidene halides, such as vinyl bromide, vinylidene chloride, etc. vinylidene monomers having at least one terminal CH2 C grouping, such as esters of acrylic acid, for example methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, cyanoethyl acrylate, and the like vinyl acetate esters of methacrylic acid such as methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and the like styrene and styrene derivatives including amethyl styrene, vinyl toluene, chlorostyrene vinyl naphthalene diolefins including butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, and the like and mixtures of any of these types of monomers and other vinylidene monomers copolymerizable therewith and other vinylidene monomers of the types known to those skilled in the art. The present invention, however, is particularly applicable to the suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride, either alone or in admixture with one or more other vinylidene monomers having at least one terminal CH2 C grouping, copolymerizable therewith in amounts as great as about 808 or more by weight of comonomer, based on the weight of the monomer mixture. Among the initiators or catalysts which may be employed in the practice of the present invention are the alkanoyl, aroyl, alkaroyl and aralkanoyl diperoxides and mono hydroperoxides, azo compounds, peroxy esters, percarbonates, and the like. Illustrative of such catalysts are benzoyl diperoxide, lauryl diperoxide, diacetyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxides, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, din so propylbenzene hydroperoxide, 2, 4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, naphthoyl peroxide, acetyl cyclohexane sulfonyl peroxide, tbutyl perbenzoate, di t butyl perphthalate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di sec butyl peroxydicarbonate, and the like, azo bis isobutyronitrile, alpha, alpha azodiisobutyrate, and the like.The choice of any particular freeradical catalyst or initiator is dictated in part by the particular monomer or monomers to be polymerized and by the color requirements of the polymer. In the isothermal suspension polymerization process the temperature is kept constant throughout the entire polymerization period. This is accomplished by circulating a cooling medium through the jacket of the polymerization reactor, said cooling medium being a material such as water.However, removal of heat during the first part of the reaction is not efficient since one is not utilizing the entire cooling efficiency of the jacket. As the polymer ization proceeds, the rate of reaction increases and thus the heat increases and removal of this excess heat cannot be accomplished fast enough with the standard jacket and the standard cooling means. That is to say, if it is necessary to remove 2,000,000 BTU s during the course of the reaction per hour, in the first part of the reaction while the capacity for such removal is there in the jacket, only 1,000,000 BTU s per hour will be removed inasmuch as the reaction is slow in the early part of the polymerization process. Then as the reaction rate increases, it becomes very difficult to remove the 2,000,000 BTU s per hour while trying to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture constant. When using the temperature programming of the instant invention this problem of heat removal is overcome.More importantly, the idea is to linearize the reaction rate and thereby reduce the excessive heat buildup. This is accomplished by operating the first part of the reaction up to approximately 10 conversion at a higher temperature than usual and then gradually reducing the temperature over a period of time up to approximately 70 conversion, which gradual reduction in temperature of the reaction mixture is referred to as ramping . The temperature of the reaction mixture will usually be reduced in the range of about 20C to about 100C. This of course, has the effect of approximately linearizing the reaction rate. This linearization of the reaction rate by means of the present invention, enables the use of more catalyst and or more monomer thereby increasing the productivity of polymer or polyvinyl chloride PVC and surprisingly in less time than in the isothermal polymerization procedure. On the other hand, with some of the monomers set out above and the choice of catalyst, it may be necessary to ramp the temperature of the reaction upward in order to obtain linearization of the reaction rate. In this situation, the initial temperature of the reaction mixture will be below that normally employed and then after 10 conversion has been reached, gradually increased until 70 or more conversion is reached in order to linearize the reaction rate. This increase in temperature will correspond to the decrease in temperature previously referred to and referred to hereinafter. Inasmuch as temperature programming utilizes a steadily falling temperature throughout most of the polymerization run, the pressure in the reactor will also steadily fall. However, if one compares the reactor pressure to the vapor pressure of for example, vinyl chloride, at the reactor temperature, the two are equal up to slightly over 70E conversion, at which time the reactor pressure steadily drops in relation to the vapor pressure of vinyl chloride at the reaction temperature. This is referred to as the pressure drop period. Temperature programming has the effect of linearizing the reaction rate only in the region of about 10 conversion up to pressure drop. Beyond pressure drop, there will be a significant increase in the reaction rate.Eventually, this increased rate may exceed the heat removal capability and the temperature tailpeaks However, the point in the reaction cycle at which this occurs will be higher in conversion for temperature programmed charges than for the isothermal charges. If the onset of the tail peak is used to terminate the run or charge, it has been found that the temperature program charges will run about 1.0 to about 10.0 higher in conversion than the isothermal charges. As has been previously pointed out, when using the temperature programming of the instant invention, increased productivity will occur as the initiator or catalyst level is increased. Usually in isothermal polymerization reactions a catalyst will be employed in the range of about 0.01 part to about 1.0 part based on the weight of the monomer or monomers employed in the reaction. By use of the present invention, catalyst or initiator concentration can be increased by about 5 to about 25 by weight over and above that normally used. For example, when employing G.041 part by weight of the catalyst in the temperature programming reaction process, the average rate of reaction is increased approximately 15 and the reactor productivity is increased about 10 .While further increases in the initiator level are possible, this will decrease the safety margin between the reaction rate maximum, which occurs near 25e conversion, and the heat removal capability. In order. to more clearly define the present invention, the following specific examples are given. It is to be understood, however, that this is merely intended in an illustrative and not in a limitative sense. In the Examples, all parts and percents are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE I In this Example, vinyl chloride was polymerized isothermally for comparative purposes. An 1,100 gallon polymerizer or reactor was employed and the following recipe was charged to the reactor in the usual fashion Recipe For Example I Part Vinyl chloride 100 Water demineralized 200 Vinol 5401 0.05 SBP2 catalyst 0.05 1 898 hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate 2di secondary butyl peroxydicarbonate The polymerization charge was then run isothermally at a set point of 500C, and took 280 minutes or 4.7 hours to reach 80 conversion. This recipe actually developed more heat than the reactor could remove, as was evidenced by a 11 20 tailpeak, that is, temperature rise above set point, late in the polymerization. EXAMPLE II In this Example the same reactor as was employed in Example I was used and the same recipe as Example I was charged to the vessel with the exception that the catalyst level was increased to 0.0575 part. The polymerization was then run using temperature programming wherein initial set point was 4 degrees higher than in Example I, or a temperature of 540C and this temperature was maintained up to 10 conversion. Thereafter, the steady downward ramp or reduction in temperature was begun, reaching 460C at 70E conversion. This lower set point of 460C was then maintained throughout the remainder of the polymerization reaction. This charge required only 240 minutes or four hours to reach 80 conversion. This showed that the average reaction rate had been increased 17 by using the temperature programming process of the instant invention.Further, the charge only developed a 1 20C tailpeak late in the polymerization, thus only barely exceeding the heat removal capabilities of the reactor. These results clearly show the superiority of the instant invention over the prior art processes. By employing the temperature programming of the instant invention it has the advantage of substantially linearizing the reaction rate. With a substantial linear reaction rate it is possible to utilize the heat removal capabilities of the reactors being employed. A further advantage is that more catalyst or monomer can be employed in the reaction thus resulting in increased production per unit. This increased production is accomplished without additional capital investment which is a great advantage. Further, the resin properties have not significantly changed when employing the instant invention, for example, such properties as porosity, powder mix time, average particle size, particle size distribution, apparent density, and compact density or flow time. Numerous other advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. While the present invention has been described in terms of its specific embodiments, certain modificatIons and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention which is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
