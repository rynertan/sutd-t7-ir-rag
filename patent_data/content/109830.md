# INERTIAL BOREHOLE SURVEY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system and method for surveying, with accuracies better than one foot per thousand feet of depth, very deep boreholes 20 having the attendant small diameters, high temperatures and high pressures. A downhole probe 24 is used having a small diameter, less than about four inches. Three linear type accelerometers 212, 214, 216 and at least two gyros 208, 210 to provide three sensitive axes X, Y, Z are fixedly mounted at points spaced along the axis Z of and elongated, rigid, thermally conductive support member 192 to form an instrument cluster assembly 52 . Signals from these instruments are then processed and transmitted serially over a conductor 34 of a conventional wireline 30 to the surface where a computer 25 continuously computes and records the current position of the probe. The instrument cluster assembly 52 is disposed in a thermally isolated sleeve 40 supported in a cylindrical pressure vessel or housing 26 and temperature controlled by isothermal heat absorbing units 44, 58, 164 .
