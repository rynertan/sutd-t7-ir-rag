# PURIFICATION OF INTERFERON

## Abstract
Human interferons produced in the absence of added serum of sera can be purified to greater than 95 protein purity by adsorption on immobilized Cibacron Blue F3G A and eluting the interferon adsorbed on the Cibacron Blue F3G A with ethylene glycol in an aqueous buffer solution. The purified interferon in solution can be converted to interferon of uniform molecular weight by heating the interferon solu tion in the presence of an organic thiol compound.
