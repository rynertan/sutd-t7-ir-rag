# TRANSPORTABLE BUILDING MODULES AND BUILDING STRUCTURES INCORPORATING SUCH MODULES

## Abstract
Transportable factory made modules for assembly into buildings include load bearing support frames having a pair of space apart end or portal frames, a floor frame 24, 26 and a roof frame 20, 22 , the former including two elongated open web trusses 24 with tubular floor purlins 26 secured in paced relationship therebetween. Reinforcing floor elements 52 are secured to the trusses and floor purlins and reinforcing mesh 54 extends over the area of the frame, jointly to re inforce a cast in situ concrete slab floor 50 which is able to undergo loads occurring during transit of the building module 10 without damage. The roof frame includes longitudinal tubular beams 20 and transverse roof purlins 22 secured therebetween, the purlins having a predetermined slope across the width of the module, such that a roof 70 secured thereto has a like slope. Non load pearing exterior 85 and interior wall 140 structures are secured to the load bearing support frame to conceal the structural elements of the frame. Preferably, the exterior wall elements are glass reinfored concrete panels 85 which are secured around the exterior of the frame, while the interior wall structures 140 are rigidly secured at a lower end to the concrete floor 50 etc and flexibly secured at an upper end to a portion of the structure. Interior wall panels 140 may be gypsum board preferably reinforced across the face and the joints therebetween with either a fabric adhesively secured thereto or a flexible polymeric film produced in situ there across. Each individual module is virtually complete when it leaves the factory and has sufficient structural integrity that connections between adjacent modules generally are only required to ensure coplanarity of adjacent surfaces.
