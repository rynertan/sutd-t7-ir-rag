# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDLING CONTAINER CHASSIS

## Abstract
A container chassis handling attachment 12 for a lift truck 20 having a lift carriage 16 includes a frame for attachment to the lift carriage. It also includes clamping means 38 having a pair of upper and lower laterally spaced forks independently mounted to the frame by separate four bar linkages and movable by separate hydraulic cylin ders. A clamp positioning means 40 cooperates with the fork to rotate the forks and any chassis gripped thereby through up to 180 . The attachment is used to store a chassis 28 by clamping from one side opposing top and bottom surfaces of the chassis, lifting the chassis, rotating the chassis about 90 to a substantially upright position, and depositing the chassis in such position against a support. Alternatively, the chassis may be rotated 180 to an upside down position and deposited onto an underlying right side up chassis, eventually to form a stack of alternating right side up, upside down chassis.
