# OPTICAL SWITCH.

## Abstract
An optical switch for an optical circuit makes use of the electro optical effect. Electrodes 13a, 13b are arranged over an optical waveguide 11 which has branch optical waveguides 12a, 12b and is formed by the employment of an electro optical material, and a voltage is applied across the electrodes 13a, 13b to control guided light. The optical waveguides 11, 12a, 12b to control guided light are formed by a layer of PLZT Pb, La Zr, Ti O₃ epitaxially grown on a C plane of a sapphire α alumina substrate 15 .
