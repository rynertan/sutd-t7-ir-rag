# Radiation detectors.

## Abstract
A radiation detector including a substrate 3 of photoconductive material, an input contact 5 and an out put contact 7 , there being a photocarrier flow path defined between the two contacts 5,7 . In order to enhance the bandwidth response of the detector, regions 9 of higher conductivity and photocarrier recombination rate for example, regions 9 of gold are included in the flow path. The regions 9 may overlay the substrate 3 , may lie in grooves 15 in the substrate or, where the substrate 3 is divided into separated photoconductive regions 17 , may lie between these regions 17 . The substrate 3 may be provided with slots 19 to increase the flow path length and further enhance detector responsivity. A detector, thus modified, and of cadmium mercury teluride photoconductive material, may be used as a large area detector in an infra red laser rangefinding system.
