# Improvements in bearing arrangements.

## Abstract
A self contained bearing unit 5 rotatably supports a tool spindle 3 in a bore of a machine tool housing wall 2 . The unit 5 employs an angular contact ball bearing 8,9 of which the outer race 9 is displaced axially relative to the inner race 8 to alter the pre loading by supplying pressure fluid to a chamber 24 independent of the bore containing a resiliently deformable seal 13 or an annular bellows device.
