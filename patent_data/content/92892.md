## Description
Sound deadening structure. The invention relates to a sound deadening structure comprising elements to be connected with one another. In the usual sound deadening structures metal or concrete screens are frequently employed whereby generally one is limited to the erection of flat, straight walls. Thereby there are relatively few possiblities of use of such screens. Sometimes earthen dike bodies are built up, but an adequate height of such a dike body requires a comparatively large ground surface. The invention has for its object to provide a sound deadening structure which permits structures of varying shape and design in many ways by using a few standard components. According to the invention this can be achieved in that the structure comprises box shaped parts provided round about with a plurality of coupling members for connecting filling parts between the box shaped parts. In the structure according to the invention the filling parts can be coupled at various points with the box shaped parts so that many variations in the development of the sound deadening structure can be obtained, as will become apparent hereinafter. Apart therefrom the structure may serve as an earth retaining wall, as a reinforcement of tali or otherwise to bridge level differences or to stiffen earth bodies or the like. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a plan view of a box shaped part of a sound deadening structure embodying the invention.

Fig. 25 is a schematic, perspective view of a further embodiment of a trough to be used as a filling part. The box shaped element shown in the accompanying drawings has an octogonal cross section, but it will be obvious that within the spirit and scope of the invention other cross sections of the hollow elements may be chosen, for example, circular, elliptical or other sections differing from the octogonal cross section. The box shaped element shown in Figs. 1 to 3 is hollow and the wall 1 of the box shaped element is the boundary wall of a central cavity 2 slightly tapering in the direction of height of the element. At equal intervals, in the embodiment shown at the centres of the boundary faces of the box shaped element, recesses 3 extend along the full height of the box shaped element 1. The recesses 3 are bounded by a wall 4, which preferably constitutes an arc of a circle, in which the distance between the ends of the wall 4 is smaller than the diameter of the ar concerned, which will be apparent from Fig. 1. Preferably the recesses 3 are s also slightly tapering. The height of such a box shaped element may be 30 cms and the width may be 60 cms, although , of course, other dimensions may be used. Figs. 4 and 5 show a similar box shaped element and corresoonding parts are designated by the same reference numerals as in Figs. 1 to 3.In the embodiment shown in Figs. 4 and 5, however the box shaped element is provided near the end having the smaller sectional area of the inner passage 2 with a closing wall 5, at the centre of which is provided a small hole 6. the element shown in Figs. 4 and 5 may be employed as the top element of a plurality of superposed, box shaped elements as a terminal element. The element shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is furthermore particularly suitable for use as a lowermost, ground contacting element of a plurality of stocked elements. Owing to its large surface the closing wall then bearing on the ground ensures a low surface pressure so that sinking into the ground is minimized. The above described, box shaped elements tnay be employed in conjunction with the filling parts shown in Figs. 6 to 8 in the form of plate shaped elements 7.From Fig. 8 it will be particularly apparent that these plate shaped elements are constructed so that, in a sectional view, an upwardly extending boundary wall 8 is at right angles to the horizontal base wall 9, whereas the other upwardly extending boundary wall 10 is upwardly inclined from its connection with the base 9 towards the wall 8. The upper boundary wall 11 has a stepwise design so that on the side of the upwardly inclined sidewall 10 a protruding nose 12 is formed. The ends of the plate shaped element 7 are joined by coupling members 13 having a sectional areaXsuch that they can be slipped into the recesses 3 of the box shaped elements. The design is preferably such that when located in recesses 3 the coupling members 13 can still slightly turn about their longitudinal axes with respect to the box shaped elements concerned. The centre lines 14 of the coupling members 13 are in positions such that superposed plates coupled with box shaped elements can be alter nately.disposed as is illustrated in Fig. 8. Tnis design of the plates ensures a satisfactory, sound deadening junction between the plates. A further embodiment of a plate shaped element suitable for use in conjunction With the box shaped elements is shown in Figs. 9 to 11. From these Figures it is apparent that this plate shaped element is formed at least mainly by a flat plate 15, the ends of which are slightly tapering. These ends have holes 16. Along a longitudinal sidn the plate 15 is provided with an upwardly extending nose 17. For connecting the plate shaped elements shown in Figs. 9 to 11 with the box shaped elements the coupling member 18 shown in Fig. 12 may be employed, said member being formed by a shaft 19 having a thickened central portion 20.The thickened central portion 20 fits in a hole 16 in the plSte shaped element, whereas the thinner parts on both sides of said thickened central portion 20 of the shaft 19 are fitting in the recesses 3. When two box shaped elements are disposed at the required distance from one another, the ends of a plate shaped element 15 can be laid down on said two box shaped elements. By meets of the elements described above many different constructions of sound deadening structures can be obtained in a simple manner. Fig. 13 is an elevational view of a sound deadening structure formed by stacked box shaped elements with plate shaped parts intermediate there between. An effective length of the plate shaped parts is such that the centre to centre distance between successive columns of stacked boxshaped elements is about 150 cms,though, of course, other dimensions may be chosen. The stacked box shaped elements may be filled with earth or concrete. As is shown in Fig. 14, columns of stacked box shaped elements may be arranged side by side in the direction of length of the structure, whilst these box shaped elements extending in the direction of length of the sound deadening structure can be coupled with plate shaped parts 7 extending transversely of the direction of length of the structure. As is shown in Figs. 14 and 15 the box shaped elements may be piled up perpendicularly one above the other or the distance between the box shaped elements may be varied. As is. shown in Figs. 16 and 17 the horizontal plateshaped elements 15 or the perpendiculsrly stacked plate shaped parts 7 can be arranged between the box shaped elements in the direction of length of the sound deadening structure.When the inner space of the construction in which plates 7 and 15 may be arranged between box shaped elements as anchoring elements, is filled out with earth, this earth bearing on the horizontal, plate shaped elements 15 will form a given talus, where plants can grow between the plate shaped elements 15. Owing to the noses 19 of the plates 15, which continue up to the box shaped elements, the ground layer may have a given thickness tIp to the front side of the plates so that plants can be grown up to the front side of the plates 15. The noses 19 furthermore prevent the earth from being blown or flushed away due to wind or rain. As is schematically shown in Fig.18, the plate shaped elements may be arranged in a rampart 21 of earth or the like,having a break 22.In the area of said break the head ends of the earthen rampart may be surrounded by a wall formed in the manner described above by the stacked, box shaped elements and the intermediate, plate shaped parts. Fig. 19 is a schematic plan view of an embodiment of the sound deadening structure, which will give a clear impression of the many variations in shape and design of the rampart obtainable by using the simple basic elements described above with reference to Figs. 1 to 12. The recesses 3 in the box shaped elements may furthermore be used for accommodating the posts of frames, which is thus disposed between two relatively spaced columns of staeked box shaped elements. In this way for example, doors, transparent or opaque screens and similar elements may be mounted with the aid of the frames in a construction erected with the aid of the elements described above. If in building up the construction it is desired to arrange vertical plates rather than horizontal plates or conversely at a given level between the box shaped elements, a so called coupling pin half may be used, that is to say a pin having the shape of the pin shown in Fig. 12, in which the part of the shaft 19 on one side of the thickened central portion is omitted. As filling parts between the box shaped elements also t.roughs 23 of concrete, synthetic resin or similar material may be used as is shown in Fig. 20. The embodiment of the trough shown in this Figure comprises a rear wall 24, sidewalls 25 and a front wall 26. For reinforcing the connection between the front wall 26 and the rear wall 24 transverse partitions 27 extending more or less parallel to the sidewalls ar arranged between the front wall and the rear wall.From Fig. 20 it will be apparent that these transverse partitions are disposed in groups of two partitions near one another, whilst the space between the transverse partitions 27 is covered near the top rims of the transverse partitions 27 by stip shaped parts 28, below which hollow spaces 29 are thus formed. At the top ends of the sidewalls 25 flanges 30 extend outwardly.Below these flanges are arranged coupling members 31, which are preferably hollow and the shape of which matches the recesses 3 in the box shaped elements 1 so that these coupling elements can be inserted into the recesses 3. The lower ends of the coupling elements 31 are in engagement with strip shaped parts 32 transversely adjoining the sidewalls 25, which strips will also fall into a recess when a trough 23 is coupled with a box shaped element 1. The troths 23 described above can be effectively made from synthetic resin the design may be such that they can be nested for transport purposes as is illustrated in Fig. 22. When arranged as filling parts between the box shaped elements 1 in order to obtain a sound deadening structure the sidewalls 24 will be in line with one another in vertical positions as is shown in Fig. 24. The front walls 26, the lower rims of which are connected with the aid of a bottom with the lower rims of the rear walls 24 of the troughs 23 concer 0 ned, are then upwardly inclined at an angle of, for example, about 45 in a direction away from the rear wall.The design is such that the top edge of the front wall 26 is located at a lower level than the top edge of the rear wall 24 in a manner such that the line of connection between these two top edges is at an angle of about 300 to 450 to the horizontal, which more or less corresponds to the natural talus of garden soil 34 or the like to be charged into the troughs. Thus plants 35 can be grown on the surface of the garden soil in the troughs so that a sound deadening structure is obtained with vegetation on at least one side. In order to prevent the passage of sound in the cavities 29, these cavities can be closed by means of filling pieces 36 in recesses in the rear wall 24 as is schemtaically shown in Fig. 21. When arranging the trough shaped filling parts 23 between the box shaped elements the auxiliary pieces 37 shown in Fig. 23 are used they are formed by a disk 38 having a thickness equal to that of the flanges 30, a coupling piece 39 protruding below the disk and fitting in the top end of a recess 3 and a coupling piece 40 protruding above the disk and fitting in the lower end of a recess 3. At least in some of the recesses 3 not occupied by coupling pieces 32 associated with troughs 23 are arranged in the coupling pieces 39 of the auxiliary elements 37 so that apart from the flanges 30 a few disks 38 will bear on the top sides of the box shaped parts concerned.In this manner a satisfactory support of a box shaped part to be disposed on the first box shaped part is obtained at various points so that the higher box shaped part does not tend to tilt. Fig. 25 shows a further embodiment of a trough to be tised as a filling part. Parts corresponding with those of the trough described above are designated by the same reference numerals as in the preceding Figures.In this embodiment the partitions 27 are omitted and the front wall and rear wall are provided with depressed parts or stiffening ridges 4 1. It will be obvious that within the spirit and scope of the invention many variants and or additions to the embodiments described above and illustrated in the Figures are conceivable. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain more clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction ooncerning the interpretation of the invention.
