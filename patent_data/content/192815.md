# Tone control device in monochromatic tone display apparatus.

## Abstract
In a tone control device in a monochromatic tone display apparatus, when an intensity signal and at least one of the R, G and B signals is active, an AND gate 17 generates a maximum tone level signal. A selector adder having OR gates 13, 14, 15 and resistors R13, R14, R15 receives the maximum tone level signal and the R, G and B signals. When the maximum tone level signal is inactive, the selector adder generates a tone level signal in response to the active state of the R, G and B signals. When the maximum tone level signal is active and all the R, G and B signals are inactive, the selector adder generates a minimum tone level voltage. However, when the maximum tone level signal and at least one of the R, G and B signals is active, the selector adder generates a maximum tone level voltage.
