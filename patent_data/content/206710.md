# CMOS HIGH VOLTAGE SWITCH

## Abstract
A CMOS high voltage switch for interfacing between a decoder output and an input to an erasable, programmable read only memory includes an inverter for receiving an input signal from the output of the decoder. A N channel MOS pass transistor has a conduction path and a gate electrode. One end of the conduction path is connected to the output of the in verter, and the other end of the conduction path is connected to an output node. The gate electrode of the pass transistor is connected to a first lower supply potential. A pumping device is connected to the other end of the conduction path for pumping the output node to a first higher voltage during a first mode of operation. A P channel MOS switching transistor is also connected to the other end of the conduction path for switching the output node to a second lower voltage during a second mode of operation.
