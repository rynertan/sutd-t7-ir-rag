# Buffer composition, method for the electrophoretic separation of proteins and buffer solution therefor.

## Abstract
A non barbiturate buffer composition for use in the elec trophoretic separation of proteins into fractions, the buffer composition consisting essentially of water soluble salicy late, a water soluble inorganic salt such as sodium chloride, and buffer to maintain the pH at from about 8.2 to 9.0.
