# Microwave diplexer.

## Abstract
Apparatus for processing microwave signals at two predetermined frequencies. Signals at a first predetermined frequency are received or transmitted at one end 25 input port of a microwave transmission line 23 whose other end 26 is utilized as a common output port for transmitting and receiving signals at both predetermined frequencies. A band rejection portion is provided which comprises first and second rejection resonators 30, 37 orthogonally disposed along the transmission line 23 at two predetermined positions. A bandpass portion, comprised of a plurality of collinearly aligned bandpass resonators 47, 48 is disposed at a third predetermined position along the transmission line 23 . Signals at a second predetermined frequency are transmitted or received at a second input port 55 which is part of the bandpass portion. All resonators are capacitively coupled together and to the tranmission line. Signals at both predetermined frequencies may be applied to the first and second input ports 25, 55 and are combined in the transmission line 23 by the filtering action of the resonators 30, 37, 47, 48 . Conversely, signals having both predeter mined frequencies may be applied to the output port 26 and separated in the transmission line such that signals at the first predetermined frequency are provided at the first input port 25 and signals at the second predetermined frequency are provided at the second input port 55 . Also, signals at one frequency may be transmitted by way of the diplexer while signals at the second frequency are received thereby, or vice versa.
