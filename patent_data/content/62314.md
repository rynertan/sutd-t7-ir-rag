# NON LINEAR RESISTOR AND PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
A non linear resistor having each continuous film havin no gas permeability and lower electrical resistiv ity than the resistivity of a sintered body between the sintered body having non linear resistance characteristics and an electrode, has excellent stability for application of rated voltage for a long period of time.
