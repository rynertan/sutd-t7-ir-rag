# ELECTRIC DELAY DEVICE

## Abstract
Separate electrical timing and load activation devices are provided for each of plural electrical loads and each device is in use connected to receive reference timing signals from a remote central unit. Each of the separate timing and load activation devices measures a reference time interval accurately defined by the reference timing signals and subsequently activates its associated electrical load after a respectively corresponding predetermined time delay which is determined as a function of the locally measured reference time interval. The time interval may advantageously be measured by counting locally generated clock pulses, for example, in an up down counter which after counting the pulses between two reference timing signals reverses direction and activates the load when the count reaches the initial value. The devices are especially useful for firing electric fuseheads for blasting detonators in a predetermined delay sequence.
