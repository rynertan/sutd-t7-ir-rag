# A method for manufacturing an information memory disk.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing an information memory disk comprises a process for preparing a die having an annular first rugged portion corresponding to tracks, and an annular second rugged portion corresponding to a position ing mark and concentrically located against the tracks, a process for manufacturing by the use of the die a blank having an annular rugged tracks 14 corresponding to the first rugged portion and an annular rugged positioning mark 16 corresponding to the second rugged portion, a process for detecting the position of the center of the blank on the basis of the positioning mark, a process for boring a hole 12 centering around the center of the positioning mark 16 through the blank, and a process for forming a light reflect ing layer 15 on the annular rugged track.
