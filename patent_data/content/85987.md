# Fuel feeding apparatus for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A fuel feeding apparatus for internal combustion en gines, of the type having a heat type air flow meter disposed in a bypass air passage detouring an air intake passage, an air metering valve adapted to be actuated by a proportional type electromagnetic to control the flow rate of air in the bypass air passage substantially at a constant level in response to the output signal from the heat type air flow meter, and a fuel metering valve adapted to be actuated by the proportinoal type electromagnetic deice simultaneously with the control of air flow rate by the air metering valve. A pulsation suppressing means is disposed in the bypass air passage to suppress the pulsation of air pressure in the latter thereby to decrease the measurement error in the heat type air flow meter.
