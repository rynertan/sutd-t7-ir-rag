# A razor blade assembly and its method of manufacture.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a razor blade assembly in which a double edged blade strip 9, which subsequently provides first and second blades 10, 16 of a twin bladed assembly, is provided, in an insert moulding operation, with a blade platform 11, end walls 15, a guard bar 14 and a blade spacer 13 moulded on the first blade 10, and a top cap 17, end walls 22, a spacer 18 and rivets 20 moulded on the second blade 16. After cropping of the metal joining the two blades or after folding over one blade on to the other, the rivets 20 are brought into apertures 21 in the first blade 10 and blade platform 11 to locate the two blades with their edges parallel and in staggered mutual relationship. Finally the portions of the rivets 20 projecting through the blade platform 11 are flattened to permanently lock the two parts of the assembly together.
