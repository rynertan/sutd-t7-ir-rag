## Description
This invention relates to gellable silicate materials, processes for their manufacture, and shaped articles, more especially gaskets, formed from them. Asbestos containing gaskets are well known and have achieved significant commercial success. The commercial success of asbestos containing gaskets has been primarily due to the physical and chemical properties imparted to the gaskets by the asbestos fibers. The asbestos fibers facilitate the production and processability of the gaskets and the gaskets exhibit excellent heat resistance. Such properties make asbestos containing gaskets particularly useful in applications where they will be exposed to high flange pressure and high temperatures. As a result, these gaskets have been extensively employed in the automotive and compressor industries. Unfortunately, recent medical evidence indicates that asbestos fibers can cause health hazards, particularly when inhaled. These health hazard problems of asbestos fibers are well known, and accordingly, the gasket industry has been searching for replacement gasket forming compositions which need not, and preferably do not, contain asbestos fibers but yet achieve substantially the same physical and chemical properties as the prior art asbestos based gasket forming compositions. There remains a need for a composition which need not, and preferably does not, contain asbestos, particularly for use in gasket and other high temperature applications, and which exhibits good high temperature stability, good chemical resistance and which will maintain a low leakage rate. Certain asbestos free papers or other sheet material may be produced from water swellable inorganic gels and, in particular, gellable waterswelling sheet silicates. For example, United StatesPatent No. 4,239,519 is directed to the preparation of inorganic, crystal containing gels and papers, fibers, films, boards, and coatings produced therefrom.The method for making the precursor gellable silicates involves three steps a a fully or predominantly crystalline body is formed which contains crystals consisting esssentially of a lithium and or sodium water swelling mica selected from the group of fluorhectorite, hydroxyl hectorite, boron fluorphlogopite, hydroxyl boron phlogopite, and solid solutions among these, and between one or more of these and other structurally compatible species selected from the group of talc, fluortalc, polylithionite, fluorpolylithionite, phlogopite, and fluorphlogopite b that body is contacted with a polar liquid, normally water, to cause swelling and disintegration of the body accompanied with the formation of a gel and c the solid liquid ratio of the gel is adjusted to a desired value depending upon the application therefor.Glass ceramics are the preferred crystalline starting bodies. Those products are then contacted with a source of large cations to cause macro flocculation of the gel and an ion exchange reaction to take place between the large cations and the Li and or Na ions from the interlayer of the crystals. U.S. Patent No. 4,239,519 specifies using cations that have an ionic radius larger than the lithium cation with which they are exchanged. Unless otherwise specified, the ionic radii data listed below refer to Shannon and Prewitt ionit radii, R.D.Shannon, Acta Crystallogr., A32, 751 1976 . The ionic radii for large exchange cations specified inU.S. Patent No. 4,239,519 are set forth in Table 1, as is the ionic radius of Li . Ionic radii are given throughout in Angstroms conversion to nm may be achieved by dividing the values given by 10. Table 1 Cation Ionic Radius Coordination No. 6 1 2 Li 0.9 K 1.52 Rb 1.66 Cs 1.81 Ca2 1.14 Sr2 1.32 Ba2 1.49 pb2 1.33 NH4 1.48 3 1 Based on F 1.19 2 TM complexes considered low spin 3 Pauling Ionic Radius It has now been unexpectedly discovered that high temperature resistant sheet, paper, board, film, fiber and coating materials may be made from a silicate gel that is prepared by utilizing an exchange cation that is selected from a group of mulivalent cations which have an ionic radius smaller than lithium. Such materials have surprisingly been found to exhibit, in general, better sealing characteristics in gasket sealing tests for example, measuring leakage rates than materials that are prepared, as per the teaching of the prior art, with large exchange cations.Furthermore, gasket materials that are produced according to the present invention are stable to temperatures of approximately 8000C. By contrast, asbestos gasket materials are stable to temperatures of approximately 5000C. The materials of the present invention also exhibit relatively good ambient and high temperature flexibility. In particular, it has been found that the use of Cu2 r 0.62 A ,Fe2 r 0.63 A and Mg2 r 0.65 A as an exchange cation results in a flexible inorganic paper that can be readily prepared. In addition, the materials of the present invention exhibit improved dewatering and wet strength in the paper forming process over the materials that are prepared using prior art materials. It has been surprisingly found that, by using a synthetic mica that has been ion exchanged with cations of ionic radius less than the lithium ion, it is possible to manufacture a paper that, for a given thickness, is much stronger and more processable than one made using a synthetic mica ion exchanged with a cation larger than the lithium ion. It has further surprisingly been found that, in contrast to using micas exchanged with larger cations, coherent paper may be made on conventional paper making equipment, e.g., a fourdrinier machine, and the present invention accordingly provides such a process.Still further, whereas it has previously, using the larger cation exchanged micas, been necessary to have a high fiber content to manufacture a coherent paper by any method, it has proved possible, using a smaller cationexchanged mica, to make a coherent paper with a low or normal fiber content. The present invention accordingly provides such a material. The flexible inorganic materials of the present invention may be prepared by utilizing, as a starting material, a gellable water swelling silicate that has a charge per structural unit of 0.5 to 1.0, advantageously 0.6 to 1.0, and which contains interstitial Li and or Na ions. The term charge per structural unit as used herein refers to an average charge density as measured by the methods of G. Lagaly and A. Weiss, Determination of LayerCharge in Mica type Layer Silicates , Proceedings ofInternational Clay Conference, 61 80, 1969 , and G. Lagaly, Characteristics of Clays by OrganicCompounds , Clay Minerals, 16, 1 21, 1981 . The silicate generally has morphologies that are represented by thin flakes in various strips and ribbons. The ribbons and strips have typical measurements of from about 500 A to 100,000 A long, and preferably 5,000 A to 100,000 A long, 500 A to 5000 A wide and less than 100 A thick. For example, the silicate may be made according to the procedures of U.S. Patent NO. 4,239,519, and may be prepared by contacting a body consisting essentially of crystals of lithium and or sodium water swelling mica selected from the group of fluorhectorite, hydroxyl hectorite, boron fluorphlogopite, hydroxyl boron phlogopite, and solid solutions among those and between one or more of those and other structurally compatible species selected from the group of talc, fluortalc, polylithionite, fluorpolylithionite, phlogopite and fluorphlogopite, with a polar liquid, customarily water, for a time sufficient to cause the disintegration and swelling of the body with the resultant formation of gel. The silicate is then contacted with a source of small cations to effect an ion exchange reation between the small cations and the interstitial Li and or Na ions. Small cations which are suitable for use in this invention are preferably those cations which are multivalent and have an ionic radius smaller than that of lithium. Particularly useful cations Cu 2 2 2 .3 3 4 C 2 include , Mg , Mg 1 Uni , Fe , Ce , and Co This ion exchange reaction may be carried out with the silicate material itself, i.e., before paper, films, boards of other products are formed therefrom, or, depending on the nature of the end product, it may be conducted as part of and during the actual forming process for the product. For example, the gasket materials of the present invention are prepared by reacting, generally with agitation, a sheet silicate gel with a suitable source of a smaller cation in order to effect an ion exchange between the small cations and the interstitial Li and or Na cations in the silicate gel to form exchanged macro flocculated particles. For example, if the exchange cation of choice is Cu2 or Mg2 , the gel is advantageously reacted with CuSO4 orMgSO4. If the materials of the present invention are to be formed into sheet or gasket materials, the resultant exchanged gel will be agitated with sufficient sheet to produce a particle size distribution which leads to suitable particle packing in the sheet forming operation.Following this process the resultant floc is optionally washed to remove any excess salt solution and the consistency of the slurry is adjusted to, for example, from about 0.75 to about 2 solids. To promote better drainage rates on a fourdrinier wire, polyelectrolyte flocculating agents may then be added to the slurry, advantageously at a level of from about 0.1 to about 1 , and preferably 0.2 to 0.3 , of floc solids. One example of a suitable polyelectrolyte flocculating agent is Hydraid 777, which is a trademark of CalgonCorporation for an acrylamide DMDAAC DEDAAC terpolymer. This slurry is then fed to a papermaking apparatus where it is dewatered by free drainage and or vacuum drainage followed by pressing and drying on drum driers. If desired, and depending on the intended end use of the product, additional inert materials may be added to the slurry prior to dewatering. For example, if desired one or more fibrous materials, which may be fibers, may be added to the slurry to improve its drainage rate and to provide an end product that has improved strength and or handleability. When the desired end products are gasket materials, the fibers of choice are cellulose fibers, glass fibers, silicate fibers, mineral fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers and ceramic fibers. In addition, latex or other binders may be added to the slurry to provide for a product with improved strength characteristics.Generally, when organic materials are utilized in the gasket materials of the present invention, they will burn off at elevated temperatures without affecting the sealing characteristics of the gasket. The compositions of the present invention are adaptable for uses other than gasket materials. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Application Serial No.588,577, and British Patent Application No.they may be utilized in combination with phosphate bonding materials to provide laminates that are fireresistant and relatively smoke free. In the following Examples, the starting material utilized was a lithium fluorhectorite made according to procedures taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,239,519. The gasket sealing tests specified for certain of the Examples were electromechanical air leakage tests conducted according to the requirements set forth in pages 1 3 of the SAE Society of Automotive Engineers,Inc. technical paper No. 83022 ISSN 0148 7191 83 0228 0220, 1983 . Example 1 This example illustrates a method of producing a copper exchanged fluorhectorite gelled silicate and a formed sheet prepared therefrom. A slurry of copper fluorhectorite was prepared by adding 325 grams of a 10 dispersion of lithium fluorhectorite to 2 liters of 0.2N CuSO4 solution. The slurry was then agitated with a high shear mixer to reduce the particle size of the resultant floc, washed and then analyzed for water content and diluted to result in a 2 solids slurry. The slurry was transferred to an 11.5 x 11.5 about 0.29 m square hand sheet mold manufactured by Williams ApparatusCo. and dewatered. The resultant formed sheet was then wet pressed and dried on a drum drier. The sheet had good flexibility and performed well in the gasket sealing test. Example 2 A slurry of copper fluorhectorite was prepared by adding 800 grams of 10 lithium fluorhectorite to 4000 grams of 0.15N CuSO4. The resultant floc was agitated and washed as described in Example 1. Four grams of Kaowool The Babcock Wilcox Co. s trademark for alumina silicate ceramic fiber was dispersed in water followed by the addition of the copper fluorhectorite floc to produce a slurry with a solids content of about 2 . The pH was adjusted to 4.0 withH2SO4 and 4 ml of a 0.1 solution of a cationic polyelectrolyte polymer Hydraid 777 was then added. The slurry was transferred to a 14 x 14 about 0.36 square hand sheet mold and dewatered. The resultant sheet was wet pressed and dried. The resultant sheet had good flexibility and performed well in the gasket sealing test. Example 3 Copper fluorhectorite was prepared by adding 475 grams of 10 lithium fluorhectorite to 2375 ml of 1N CuSO4. The resultant floc was agitated and washed as described in the examples above. Four grams of Kaowool were dispersed in water followed by the addition of the copper fluorhectorite floc. The solids content of the resultant slurry was adjusted to 2 and then 0.5 gram of a 10 Na3PO4.12H2O solution and 6 grams of 0.1 Hydraid 777 aqueous solution were added to the solution. A hand sheet was prepared as previously described. Example 4 Magnesium fluorhectorite was prepared by adding 475 grams of 10 lithium fluorhectorite dispersion to 2500 ml of 2N MgSO4. The floc was agitated and washed as previously described. A slurry containing 14 grams of Kaowool was prepared to which the magnesium fluorhectorite was added and the resultant slurry diluted to a solids contents of 2 . To this slurry was added 1.0 gram of 10 Na3PO4 . 12H20 solution and 22.8 grams of 0.5 Hydraid 777 solution.A hand sheet was prepared as previously described. Example 5 Magnesium fluorhectorite floc was prepared as described above. A slurry was formed containing 3 grams of glass fiber, 3 grams of cellulose fibers, followed by the addition of the magnesium fluorhectorite floc. The solids content of the slurry was adjusted to 2 followed by the addition of 0.2 gram of 10 Na3PO4 . 12H20, 15 grams of 0.5 Hydraid 777 and 15 grams of a polyethylene imide polyelectrolyte Polmin P, manufactured by BASF Corporation . A hand sheet was formed as described above. Examples 6 9 Batches of iron fluorhectorite, cobalt fluorhectorite, nickel fluorhectorite and zinc fluorhectorite were each prepared by ion exchanging a 10 lithium fluorhectorite gel with 1000 ml of 1N solutions of, respectively, Fe NO3 3 . 9H2O Example 6 , CoC12 . 6H20 Example 7 , Ni NO3 2 . 6H20 Example 8 , and Zn NO3 2 . 6H20 Example 9 . For each example, the flocculated particles were stirred and allowed to stand overnight. The particles were then broken down by mechanical stirring and vacuum filtered. The filtered floc was added to fresh deionized water and stirred vigorously for several minutes and vacuum filtered. This was repeated 5 times. The resultant filter cakes were analyzed for water content and diluted with deionized water to adjust the solids content to 10 .The resultant slurries were homogenized for 30 minutes. For each of Examples 6 9, films cast of the respective slurry were utilized in tests to measure the gasket sealing characteristics. Comparative Example Potassium fluorhectorite KFH was prepared by the process specified in U.S. Patent No. 4,239,519. A film was then cast of the KFH slurry and was tested in the same manner as the products of Examples 6 9 above.The data from these tests are shown in Table 2 below, which also lists the ionic radii of each exchange cation.
