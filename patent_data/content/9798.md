## Abstract
In an air cushion supported vegetation cutter comprising a cutter casing 1 housing an impeller 3 for creating the air cushion in conjunction with the casing, an aperture 10 in the casing to permit air flow to the impeller, and a support struc ture 12,19 for supporting a motor for driving the impeller, the support structure provides a duct 71 for the flow of cooling air over the motor and the duct has cooling air out lets 72 , located upstream of the aperture 10 in the casing 1 . This arrangement provides an improved motor cooling arrangment in which the motor cooling air and the air for the impeller interact upstream of the impeller.
