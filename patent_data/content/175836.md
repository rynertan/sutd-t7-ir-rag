# Solar heat collector system.

## Abstract
A solar heat collector system comprising a heat collec tor circuit containing a compressor that compresses and outputs thermal media and is capable of varying its own capacity by conversion of operative frequencies a conde nsor being part of the heat collector circuit, which is connected to the output of the compressor a plurality of heat collectors integrally built with housing materials, one end of which is connected to one end of the compressor via a squeezer and the other end to the heat collector connected to the compressor, where each unit of heat collector contains a plurality of thermal media tubes allowing thermal media to pass through inside and heat collect fins connected to the thermal media tubes for transferring heat a hot water pool storing hot water for use inside the house and a fluid heating circuit comprising the condensor and fluid heater that are held in the heat exchange relationship outside of the hot water pool.
