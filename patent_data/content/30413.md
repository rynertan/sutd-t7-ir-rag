## Description
A system for the positive and economically optimal handling of valuable documents within a monetary establishmentTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention results to systems for the positive and economically optimal handling of documents of value within a monetary establishment, such as a banking concern or postal institution, having a main office and a plurality of branch offices. More specifically the invention relates to apparatus comprising a main data processor and a plurality of control units and or branch data processors.BACKGROUND ART It is previously known to provide in banks and like monetary institutions unmanned devices by means of which e.g.money can be deposited and withdrawn, these devices being especially installed to provide an after hours service. It is also known to provide such devices with separate cassettes having special locking means and means for rendering the contents of the cassette worthless if the cassette lid is forced by an unauthorized person. When deposits or withdrawals are effected at banks or post offices through a transaction means provided with a special keybank, it is known to check and to register said transactions through a dator processor associated with said transaction means, thereby to enable the credit balance of a customer to be checked and information concerning said credit balance to be given at any point of time. Despite the provision of the aforesaid devices and arranged ments, it must be said that hitherto conventional methods of handling money are encumbered with a number of disadvantages Doth with respect to sarety rnnd to economy. The knowledge that ces car had at a times f the day to lar ums of money, ay spire pe ery, with risk of i ry to people and damage to the building concerned. The lack of money supply due to bad planning or as a result of unexpectedly large withdrawals can cause inconvenience to waiting customers.Poor supervision of the transportation of banknotes etc., increases the chances of a thief escaping with his plunder.Misappropriation, e.รง. fraudulent conversion, by internal, illegal transactions which are difficult to subsequently localize, also belongs to those elements which render the rational handling of money difficult. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is to substantially eliminate the aforementioned disadvantages. In an apparatus according to the invention, money is handled by the co action between a main data processor incorporated in said system and a plurality of control units or branch data processors on one hand and on the other hand a plurality of readable cassettes which can be identified by the data processors, and which are arranged to co operate with infeed means and outfeed means positioned at different locations.In this way it is possible to have available in the maindator processor, at any moment of time, information concerning the position or location of the various cassettes and the money contained therein, and information on the conditions as to when cassettes may be removed from given locations and when cassettes must, of necessity, be placed in given locations, etc.This provides for safer handling of available money and enables said money to be utilized more economically. The characterizing features of a system according to the invention are set forth in the following claims.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, in hich Figure 1 illustrates schematically a system according to the invention incorporating a main office and a single branch. office, and Figure 2 illustrates such a system incorporating a plurality of branch offices.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The system illustrated in Figure 1 comprises a main office HK having d main data processor HD, and a branch officeFK having a branch data processor FD. The branch office FK is also provided with an infeed means IE operative to feed banknotes into a number of cassettes K1, K2, K3,... and an outfeed means UE for feeding banknotes out of a number of cassettesK4, K5, K6 ... When the cassettes are placed in their intended positions in respective means, they can be individually identified by the branch data processor FD and, if so desired, also by the main data processor HD, since the two data processors are connected together over lines 10,11. The design of the cassettes Kl, K2 ...K6 and of the infeed and outfeed means IE and UE is such that when a cassette is placed in one of said means or banknotes are fed into or fed out of a cassette, an information signal concerning the operation in question is sent to the branch data processor FD and from there to the main data processor HD, either automatically or when required when called .An individual reference number of a particular cassette, e.g.K024, can be sent, e.g. automatically, to the branch data processor, by mutual co action of the cassette K024 and components of the infeed means IE, when the cassette is placed in said means, and in conjunction with each infeed transaction to said means, whereat information concerning. e.g., the number of banknotes fed in and the value thereof, together with the customer s name or account number is also sent to said main data processor. In this way it is also possible to obtain in the main data processor instantaneous information concerning the location of a cassette, the contents thereof, the balance of a customer s account, etc. When a cassette 1 removed from the infeed mean or t. outfeed mea inform t c ri effect is aIc sen to th branch date processor The cassettes are suitably provided with respective elec tronic locks, so that a cassette can only be opened upon receipt of a signal from the branch or main data processor. This enables one of the data processors to be equipped with suitable alarm means, arranged to come into operation if a cassette is not placed in its given location or if a cassette is not removed from its location within a given period of time. There are many possible variations in this respect, depending upon the different routines applied.The important thing is that through respective data processors one has full control as to where the various cassettes are to be found or not to be found, and as to how many banknotes said cassettes contain and the value of these banknotes. The branch office FK is also equipped with a banknote sorting means so operative to sort banknotes fed into cassettes previously placed in one of said infeed means, e.g. the infeed means IE. The sorting means SO is so designed that when a cassette is inserted in an infeed means, said cassette co acts with components of said sorting means in a manner to cause the identity of said cassette e.g. KO 24 to be sent to the branch data processor FD or to the main data processor HD, and subsequent to the removal of all banknotes to send information relating to the previous contents of said cassette, which contents have now been inserted into one or more further cassettes, about which information has been sent in a corresponding manner to one of said data processors. The aforementioned branch data processor FD, particularly in the case of small branch offices, can be replaced with a control unit, i.e. a unit which in principle is only a means of contact with the main data processor HD. The system illustrated in Figure 2 incorporates a main office HK having a maindata processor HD, a plurality of branch offices FK1, FK2 ... FKm each equipped with a respective branch data processor FD, infeed means IE and outfeed means UE, and a plurality of branch offices FKn, FK n l ... FK n p each having a respective control unit SE, infeed means IE and outfeed means UE. The construction and function of these units are the same as the construction and function of the units previously described with reference to Figure 1. One or more of the offices is suitably provided with a banknote sorting means SO. In a system of the kind illustrated and described, the banknotes are handled in a closed circuit, with those possibilities of increased surety and optimal use of the number of banknotes available which such a system affords. The indivual coding electronic of respective cassettes enables at each moment of ti me information to be obtained concerning the contents of an individual cassette and as to where in the system or on which ordered conveyor path therein a cassette is located. The use of a system according to the invention is not exclusive to banknotes, but can also be used in connection with other valuable documents, such as normal cheques and travellers cheques. The invention can also be applied in a manner such that an infeed means for feeding in such valuable documents is provided for co operation with at least one of said control units or branch data processors. For all infeed means there are found cassettes which can be individually identified by respective branch data processors or the main data processor. The insertion and removal of a cassette into and out of one of said outfeed means and the outfeed of valuable documents from one of said cassettes, enables information relating to both said insertion and removal and also said outfeed to be sent to the main data processor via the control unit or branch data processor in question.Information concerning the locations of inserted cassettes and the content of valuable documents thereof is thus found also in this case. Optimal use of the system is obtained when it can be used for both infeeding and outfeeding documents. Thus, means for intermediate document supply may be arranged to co operate with at least one of said control units or branch data processors. For all such means there are found cassettes which ca be identified r.di udally b ref i branch data processors d he main a d. processor. Equipment activatable both by relative mcvement between a cassette and any one of said means, and by relative movement between a document and any one of said means with a cassette located for the handling of documents, is arranged to enable information relating to the relative movement of both the cassette and the document to be sent to the main data processor via the control unit or branch data processor in question.Thus, there is present in the main data processor information concerning the identity of the cassettes and the possible connection to said means, and the document contents of said cassettes. By means is meant here infeed means or outfeed means.The relative movement between a cassette and one such means can be detected by the co action between parts in the cassette and parts in a casing in said means, said casing being designed to receive said cassette. The relative movement between a document and one of said means can be detected by mechanical, electronic or optical sensing means arranged along a documentconveying path in said casing, between a cassette and an opening which is accessible to customers, desk clerks etc. from without. As previously mentioned, the cassettes are suitably provided with electronically activatable locks. Activation of said locks can be effected from branch data processors orthemain data processor at points of time incorporated in respective data programs. By lock is. meant here not only means for holding a cassette closed, but also means for holding said cassette in its casing in respective infeed and outfeed means. Because said lock can only be released by means of said lock activating signal from a branch data processor or from said main data processor, an opera cor or serviceman wishing to remove a cassette must first identify himself, e.g. electronically to one of said data processors. The lock activating signal is sent automatically once said data processor has accepted the proof of identity submitted by said operator, e.g. in the form of an identity card. The aforedescribed arrangement provides a positive check that the cassettes are to be found in their intended locations and of the contents of said cassettes.
