# Shirred tubular material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a shirred tubular material comprising a plurality of outer folds which when the tubular material is opened are arranged along at least two substan tially parallel, longitudinally extending helixes. A method for forming the disclosed shirred tubular material is disclosed which comprises sequentially applying shirring forces through two or more sets of shirring elements wherein each successive member of a set applies shirring forces along a different continuous line than its immediate preceding member.
