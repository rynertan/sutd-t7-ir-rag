# Solenoid valve assembly.

## Abstract
A solenoid valve assembly has a slidable valve member 38 which responds to a selectively energizable solenoid coil 24 and a spring 44 to control the opening and closing of pressure and exhaust ports by movement of the valve member. When the pressure port is fully opened, the valve member is seated against a solenoid stop and port member 40 . The solenoid stop and port member includes a central flow passage 42 which serves as the exhaust passage for the valve assembly. The flow passage is surrounded by a valve seat area which comprises a frusto conical surface 52 having a recess or groove 54 formed therein. The frusto conical surface and the groove therein reduce the flow forces imposed on the valve member, which generally operate to assist seating of the valve member. By reducing the flow forces, the unseating force necessary to open the exhaust port is reduced, so permitting the use of lower spring and magnetic forces.

A solenoid valve assembly according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the valve member 38 and the valve body 16 are made of magnetic material, and the valve member includes a non magnetic insert 48 in the region of seating contact with the valve body, effective to prevent magnetic lock up between the valve member and the valve body.

## Description
SOLENOID VALVE ASSEMBLY This invention relates to a solenoid valve assembly. In one type of conventional solenoid valve assembly, a solenoid and spring controlled valve plunger is selectively movable against port and stop member having a centrally disposed exhaust flow passage, to thereby establish sealing contact between a flat valve surface and a flat valve seat. Such an assembly can necessitate the use of a considerable spring force, due to the flow forces occurring at the exhaust port. The present invention is concerned with the provision of a solenoid valve assembly in which flow forces at the exhaust port are reduced, to thereby make it possible to reduce the spring force and magnetic force requirements. To this end a solenoid valve assembly in accordance with the present invention is characterised by the features specified in the characterising portion of claim 1. In the drawing Figure 1 is an elevational view, with parts broken away and in section, of one embodiment of a solenoid valve assembly in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is an enlarged view of a portion ofFigure 1 and Figure 3 is a perspective view of part of a component of the solenoid valve assembly. With reference now to the drawing, wherein like characters represent the same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown inFigure 1 a solenoid valve assembly 10 which includes a metal housing 12 secured to a mounting bracket 14. The housing 12 has disposed therein a valve body 16 composed of non metallic material such as plastics material. The valve body 16 has a reel portion 18, a fluid port portion 20 and a central bore 22. The reel portion 18 is surrounded by a solenoid coil 24 which is adapted to be connected to an electrical control circuit, not shown, by way of an electrical fitting 26. The fluid port portion 20 includes an integrally formed pressure inlet portion 28 having a pressure passage 30 and a control passage 32. The outer surface of the fluid port portion 20 is grooved at 34 and 36 to support ring seals, not shown, for use when the solenoid valve 10 is secured in a valve block for a hydraulic control system in a well known manner. The high pressure port formed by the pressure passage 30 is open to the external area of the fluid port portion 20 between the grooves 34 and 36. The valve bore 22 has disposed therein a slidable valve plunger 38 valve member . The end 39 of the valve bore 22 is closed by an exhaust port and a solenoid stop member 40. The stop member 40 is maintained in the valve bore 22 by the housing 12. The stop member 40 has a central stepped diameter passage 42 which serves as the exhaust port or exhaust flow passage for the solenoid valve 10. As is shown in Figure 1, the valve plunger 38 is disposed between the solenoid stop member 40 and the pressure inlet portion 28. The valve plunger 38 is urged towards the inlet portion 28 by a spring 44. The valve plunger 38 has a pointed end 46 which closes the passage 30, when urged into abutment with the inlet portion 28 by the spring 44 to close off the inlet passage 30 from the control passage 32. The stop member 40 and the valve plunger 38 are formed from magnetic metals such that when the solenoid coil 24 is energized, the valve plunger 38 will move towards the stop member 40 depending upon the power supplied to the solenoid coil 24 and the strength of the spring 44, as is well known. To prevent magnetic lock up between the valve plunger 38 and the solenoid stop member 40, a non magnetic insert 48 is disposed in the valve plunger 38. The insert 48 is preferably made of stainless steel. The end 50 of the valve plunger 38 which is adapted to seat on the solenoid stop member 40 is a flat surface. As is shown in Figures 1 and 2, the smaller diameter portion of the flow passage 42 extends through the end surface 52 of the solenoid stop member 40 adjacent the flat surface 50 of the valve plunger 38.The end surface 52 of the stop member 40 is generally frusto conical in shape, such that it diverges from the flat surface 50 as it extends radially outwardly from the flow passage 42. The frusto conical end surface 52 is interrupted by a groove like recess 54 which, as is best seen in Figure 2, is V shaped in cross section.The frusto conical surface is therefore divided essentially into two annular portions, namely a radially outer surface portion 56 and a radially inner surface portion 58. The inner surface portion 58 extends from the outer edge of the passage 42 to the inner edge of the recess 54, and the outer surface portion 56 extends from the outer edge of the recess 54.The only valve seat area available for the flat end surface 50 of the valve plunger 38 to seal against is essentially a line surface at the intersection of the passage 42 and the surface 58. As the flat end surface 50 seats against the solenoid stop member 40, the flow forces which generally accompany the abutment of two flat surfaces is reduced considerably due to the presence of the recess 54 and the frusto conical shape of the end surface 52. This structure reduces the flow forces such that the force required in the spring 44 is much less than the force required in conventional valves. Since the force in the spring 44 is reduced, the power consumption and or the size of the solenoid 24 can also be reduced. Thus the valve is capable of higher efficiency than conventional valves. This valve structure has been found to work equally well both in on off type solenoid valves and in proportional control or duty cycle controlled solenoid valves.
