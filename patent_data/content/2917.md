# A detergent composition.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a detergent composition which comprises an anionic and or nonionic surfactant and, as builders, an imido bis sulfate and an aluminosilicate. These detergent compositions are of low toxicity, and in particular they avoid the use of phosphate builders, and yet possess satisfactory washing properties.
