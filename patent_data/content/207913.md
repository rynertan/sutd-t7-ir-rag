In vivo test apomorphine syndrome inhibitionA number of studies suggest that the anti psychotic action of neuroleptic drugs is in some way related to the decrease in catecholamine transmission in the brain caused by these drugs and more specifically due to central dopamine DA receptor blockade in cortical and subcortical brain regions. Most compounds with an anti psychotic action effect several DA systems in the brain. There is evidence that the anti psychotic action may be linked to blockade of DA receptors in the subcortical and cortical limbic structures J. Pharm.Pharmacol. 25, 346, 1973 Lancet, nov. 6. 1027, 1976 while the well known extrapyramidal side effects produced by neuroleptic drugs are due to blockade of DA receptors in the nigroneostriatal DA system Intern. J. Neurol. 6, 27 45, 1967 .There are presently several techniques available to study DA receptor blockade in the brain in vivo. One method is based on the ability of anti psychotic drugs to block the behavioural effects induced by theDA agonist apomorphine in the rat. Several studies indicate an excellent correlation between the in vivo DA receptor blockades as measured in the apomorphine test and therapeutic efficacy of different anti psychotic drugs. Apomorphine produces in rats and other species a characteristic syndrome consisting of repetitive movements stereotypies and hyperactivity which appear to be due to activation of postsynaptic DA receptors in the brain J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 19, 627, 1967 J. Neurol. Transm.40, 97 113, 1977 . The stereotypies chewing, licking, biting appear mainly to be induced via activation of DA receptors winked to the neostriatal DA system J. Psychiat. Res., 11, 1, 1974 whereas the increased locomotion hyperactivity mainly appears to be due to activation of DA receptors in mesolimbic structures nucleus olfactorium, nucleus accumbens i.e. the mesolimbic DA system. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 25, 1003, 1973 .A number of studies have demonstrated that neuroleptics of different structural classes block the apomorphine stereotypies in the rat and that this blockade is well related to blockade of DA transmission mea sured by biochemical or neurophysiological techniques. Thus, the antiapomorphine effect correlates well with changes in DA turnover produced by neuroleptic drugs Eur. J. Pharmacol., 11, 303, 1970 , DA receptor binding studies Life Science, 17, 993 1002, 1976 and most important with antipsychotic efficacy Nature, 263, 388 341, 1976 .MethodsMale Sprague Dawley rats weighing 225 275 g were used. The rats were observed in perspex cages 40 L x 25 w x 30 h cm and the behaviour was scored 5, 20, 40 and 60 min. after apomorphine. The compounds were injected 60 min. prior to apomorphine hydrochloride 1 mg kg which was injected subcutaneously s.c. into the neck. This dose and form of administration was found to produce a very consistent response and very low variation in response strength. Further more, apomorphine given s.c. also produced a very consistent hyperactivity.Directly after injection, the animals were placed in the cages, one in each cage. Scoring of the stereotypies were performed by two separate methods. The first scoring system was a modified version of the system introduced by Costall and Naylor 1973 . The strength of the stereotype was scored on a 0 3 scale as follows Score Description of stereotyped behaviour O No change in behaviour compared to saline controls or sedated 1 Discontinous sniffing 2 Continous sniffing 3 Continous sniffing. Chewing, biting and licking. In the second system the number of animals displaying hyperactivity caused by apomorphine were scored. Each group consisted of 6 8 animals.Saline controls were always run simultaneously. ED50 s are in the first scoring system 0 3 scale , the doses which reduce the strength of the stereotypies by 50 X over the observation period of 60 min. ED50 s of the second scoring system are the doses which reduce the number of ani mals showing hyperactivity by 50 over the observation pere 7 p min. The ED50 were calculated from log dose response curves by the method of least squares from 4 6 dose levels with 6 8 animals per dose level.B. In vitro test Receptor binding assayThe clinical efficacy of anti psychotic drugs has been shown to correlate with their ability to displace tritiated spiperone from preparations of dopamine receptors Seeman, Biochem. Pharmacol. 26, 1741 1977 .MethodThe method of Burt et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 4655 1975 was used. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 150 200 g were decapitated, and their brains were rapidly removed. The striata were dissected, pooled and homogenized in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.6 . The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation 48 000 g for ten minutes , washed once with the buffer, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.6 containing 0.1 ascorbic acid, 10 mM pargyline, 120 mM Nail, 5 mM KC1, 2mM Cacao2 and 1 mM MgC72. The suspension was preincubated at 37 C for 10 minutes and then kept on ice until use.The assays have been carried out using a cell harvester equipment. The incubations were made in quadruplicate, each well containing membrane suspension 2.5 mug 0.5 ml , 3H spiperone 0.4 nM and the test compound in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 10 minutes at 37 C, the contents of the wells were rapidly filtered and washed on WhatmanGF B filters using the Cell harvester. The specific binding was defined as the difference of 3H spiperone bound in the presence and in the absence of 1 um butaclamol. The test results are expressed as IC50. The IC50 value given in nM, indicates the concentration of the test substance which reduces the amount of specifically bound 3H spiperone by 50 .Test resultsThe test results are given in the following table.
