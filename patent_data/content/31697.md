# IMPROVED PROCESS FOR COKING PETROLEUM RESIDUA AND PRODUCTION OF METHANE THEREFROM

## Abstract
The amount of liquid products obtained by coking petro leum residua is increased by adding iron as such or in an iron forming compound form thereof or as iron oxide to the re sidua before coking. The coke produced is highly active and can be readily converted to methane by contacting it with mo lecular hydrogen.
