# Method of joining two members.

## Abstract
When a ceramic member is fixed by brazing to a member made of metal such as stainless steel, weakness may be engendered in the ceramic near the brazed joint. Herein disclosed is a brazing method wherein the extent of any run over of the brazing material onto the ceramic and or the content of the titanium wetting agent within the brazing material are carefully controlled to avoid such weakness.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Method of brazing a metal member and a ceramic member together in which method the brazing material is kept within the confines of the joint between the two members and is not permitted to flow onto a portion of the ceramic which is not overlain by the metal member. 2. A method of brazing a metal member and a ceramic member together in which method titanium is made available during the brazing to permit proper wetting of the ceramic but the amount of titanium so made available is kept sufficiently low to prevent substantial combining of excess titanium with said ceramic member, for example the titanium could be kept to around 5 or so of the brazing material by weight.

## Description
METHOD OFJOINING TWD MEMBERS This invention relates to a method of Joining two meiters together and to articles made by this method. According to one aspect of the invention there Is provided a method of brazing a metal member and a ceramic member together in which method the brazing material is kept within the confines of the joint between the two members and is not permitted to flow onto a portion of the ceramic which is not overlain by the metal member. According to a further aspect there is provided a method of brazing a metal member and a ceramic member together in which method titanium is made available during the brazing to permit proper wetting of the ceramic but the amount of titanium so made available is kept sufficiently low to prevent substantial combining of excess titanium with said ceramic member, for example the titanium could be kept to around 5 or so of the brazing material by weight. For a better understanding of the invention, reference will be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, the single figure of which is a sectional view of part of an article comprising a ceramic member attached by brazing to a metal member The illustrated article comprises a member 1 made of EN56 stainless steel having a recess 2 formed therein, the upper part of the wall 3 defining the recess being radiussed as shown.A member 4 made of alumina A1203 comprises a narrowed end portion 5 which fits into the recess 2 such that there is a comparatively large gap 6 between the end face 7 of the member 4 and the floor 8 of recess 2The corner 9 forming the boundary between the narrowed end portion 5 and the remainder of member 4 is radiussed to match the upper part of wall 3. The periphery of the end face 7 of iteiter 4 is rounded off.The members 1 and 4 are connected together by brazing, the brazing material 10 lying between wall 3 and end portion 5. The brazing operation has been carried out by positioning a pre formed piece of brazing material between the nExbers 1 and 4 and then, with the members properly held one in relation to the other, the article is placed in a vacuum furnace and heated to an appropriate temperature. The brazing material comprises titanium, silver and copper in which the titanium forms around 5 by weight of the material. As can be seen, the brazing material, after the joint has been made, remains entirely between the wall 3 and portion 5 of member 4 and has not been allowed to form a fillet extending from the joint over onto the outer surface of the member 4 at position 11 and nor has it been allowed to extend under the end face 7 of meter 4. This is ensured by only using sufficient brazing pre form in the first place, that it does not tend to overflow from its desired situiation, by making the gap 6 comparatively large so that there is less capillary effect here, and or by pre positioning suitable flow stopping materials and coating to define flow limits for the brazing material.It may be important to carefully control the amount of titanium available to the brazed joint. Some titanium is necessary to give proper wetting of the ceramic but it should be sufficiently low so that there is little as possible excess titanium available to form undesireable compounds with the other brazing material constituents or with the const t.uents of the ceramic itself. Thus, the amount of titanium in the brazing material should be less than 15 by weight, or better less than 10 , or even better less than 7.5 , or even better still around 5 or even less. In the arrangement shown, the maintaining of the brazing material within the joint may be important possibly because, if the material is allowed to form a fillet outside the joint, the destructive effect of the titanium conpounds therein and in the underlying ceramic may, since at this position the supporting effect of wall 3 is absent, facilitate the formation of cracks in the ceramic. A similar effect might occur at the peripheral edge of the end face 7 if the brazing material were allowed to proceed around this edge. A further reduction of the tendency for cracks to start at this edge may be engendered by the illustrated rounding off of this edge. As can be seen, the article is such that nowhere is there a sharp corner of the ceramic which is also in contact with brazing material. The radiussing of the wall 3 and the adjacent corner 9 may help to reduce any hoop stressing of the ceramic by the wall 3 and or the brazing material and any titanium compounds formed at this position. The brazing material 10 is thin and uniform preferably it is less than about 500 microns thick, or even better less than about 300 microns, or even better than that less than 200 microns, or even more better around 150 microns or perhaps even less.
