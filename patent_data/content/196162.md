# A METHOD OF THICKENING NON AQUEOUS LIQUIDS

## Abstract
A liquid medium which is at least mainly non aqueous is thickened by the addition of a water in oil emulsion of a water soluble polymer. The water soluble polymer is present, and preferably dissolved, in the water phase of the emulsion. An oil in water emulsifier may be added to the liquid medium to be thickened and this emulsifier may be present in the emulsion. The water in oil emulsion may be the direct product of an in verse emulsion polymerisation process.
