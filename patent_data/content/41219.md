# Jacking point structure.

## Abstract
The structure includes a bracket 10 fixed to the under side of a trunk compartment 2 at a rear portion of the vehicle and a hook 15 fixed to the bracket 10 . The bracket 10 has a first wall 11 extending horizontally and a second wall 12 extending vertically. Also, the bracket 10 has a channel por tion 13 at its center which functions as a jacking point 14 preferably at the rear end of the first wall 11 . The hook 15 extends horizontally in the backward direction of the vehicle and does not project downwardly. It is preferable that the hook 15 is formed in a U shape and welded at its legs to the first wall 11 in such a manner that the channel portion 13 of the bracket 10 is held between the legs of the hook 15 .
