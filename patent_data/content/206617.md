# LOG HOLDER

## Abstract
A log holder for supporting a log in a horizontal orientation by engaging one end of the log, thereby leaving the other end free for cutting. The holder includes a base 12 , a frame 20 extending upwardly from the base, upper 24 and lower 22 supports mounted to the frame above the base, and a counter weight support 26 . The lower support includes an upwardly facing first contact surface 56 . The upper support includes a downwardly facing second contact surface 70, 72, 74 that is horizontally spaced from the first contact surface in a first direction. The lower and upper contact surfaces are vertically positioned with respect to one another such that one end of the log 10 can be supported therebetween in a generally hori zontal orientation, with the log extending from the lower support in a direction opposite the first direction. The counter weight support is mounted to the frame above the base and is horizontally spaced from the upper support in the first direction. The upper support may include a plurality of down wardly facing second contact surfaces of different sizes. The holder may further comprise an auxiliary lower support 28 adjustably and horizontally spaced from the first mentioned lower support for supporting short logs, and a projection extending from adjacent the upper support towards the lower support for spearing one end of a log.
