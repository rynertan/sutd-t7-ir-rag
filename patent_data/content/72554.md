# A method of and a drive for oscillating the doctor blade in a printing press.

## Abstract
A drive for the doctor blade 26 of a gravure type printing press oscillates the doctor blade 26 in a non repeating motion. A doctor slide 12 is coupled to the doctor blade 26 , and oscillated on the frame 10 by a first piston cylinder unit 11 . A pneumatic valve slide 3 is driven back and forth on the frame 10 by a second piston cylinder unit 2 , between a first pair of end stops 18,19 mounted on the doctor slide 12 and between a second pair of end stops 24,25 mounted on the frame 10 . Upon engagement of the end stops 18,19 on the doctor slide 12 , the valve slide 3 provides a pressure signal to reverse the direction of motion of the doctor slide 12 . Upon engagement of the end stops 24,25 on the frame 10 , the valve slide 3 provides a pressure signal to reverse its own direction of motion on the frame.
