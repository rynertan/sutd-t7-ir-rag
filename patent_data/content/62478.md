# Spectrochemical analyzer.

## Abstract
A spectrochemicai analyzer disclosed by this invention has two monochromators capable of operating independently of each other. In each monochromator, a light beam from a light source is made to be incident on an entrance slit EN1, EN2 , and, after dispersion and wavelength scanning, issues from an exit slit EX1, EX2 as an analyzed light beam. These analyzed light beams are detected by detectors 23, 26 . The entrance slits EN1, EN2 and the exit slits EX1, EX2 of the two monochromators, are disposed in rotational symmetry about a central vertical axis. This can simplify the operation of switching between a series mode where the analyzed light from the exit slit EX1 of the one monochromator is made to be incident on the entrance slit EN2 of the other monochromator and a parallel mode where the both monochromators operate for detection independently from each other. Such mode switching is achieved by transverse sliding of mirrors 21, 22 in and out of the paths of the light beams.
