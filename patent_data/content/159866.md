## Description
This invention relates to a microbial process for the production of L amino acids, especially from 5 substituted hydantoins or N carbamyl derivatives of amino acids using microbial enzymes. There have been proposed microbial processes for producing L amino acids from 5 substituted hydantoins using various microbial enzyme Sources see JP B l3850 67, JP B 2274 79 and JP B 8749 79 . However, these processes are unsatisfactory from the efficiency viewpoint. There has also been known a process for producing L methionine from DL N carbamylmethionine using a microbial enzyme see JP B 29678 80 . This process requires separation of L methionine from D N carbamylmethionine which remains in the reaction mixture, and accordingly is not sufficiently effective. The present inventors have now found that certain microbial strains belonging to the genus The present invention provides a process for producing an L amino acid in which a 5 substituted hydantoin or an N carbamyl derivative of an amino acid is treated with cells or the contents of cells of a strain which belongs to the genus The present invention also provides a culture in a culture medium, comprising a source of assimilable carbon, a source of assimilable nitrogen and inorganic salts of a strain belonging to the genus The present invention further provides a strain belonging to the genus The The strain The taxonomical characteristics of the strain According to Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th Ed. l974 , strain DK 200 belongs to the genus The strain DK 200 of the invention belongs to new species of the genus The strain DK 200 may be prepared in large quantities by any conventional aerobic liquid culture in a medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic salts and a small amount of organic nutrients which can be assimilated by the strain. The enzyme activity can be enhanced by an addition of a small amount of for example L carbamyltryptophan to the culture medium. The culture may be carried out at a pH of from 4 ll and a temperature of from l5 40 C for a time of from 5 l20 hours. The thus obtained culture containing the cells is preferably used in the invention. In addition there can also be utilized treated materials of the cells, such as frozen cells, lyophilized cells, sonicated cells, and cell debris, e.g. homogenates and extracts of the cells, as well as intact cells. Furthermore, any variant having improved activity by some variation treatment can of course be used effectively in the present invention. Examples of 5 substituted hydantoins which can be used as starting materials in the invention include 5 benzylhydantoin, 5 indolylmethylhydantoin and 5 4 hydroxybenzyl hydantoin. Examples of N carbamyl derivatives of amino acids include N carbamylphenylalanine, N carbamyltryptophan and N carbamyltyrosine. These starting materials may be in D, L or DL from. The starting materials are known or may be prepared in any conventional manner. For example, DL N carbamyl derivatives may be prepared by the reaction of DL amino acids with potassium cyanide, or by the hydrolysis of DL hydantoin derivatives of amino acids under appropriate conditions. In the process of the invention, there is preferably used 0.l 40 , more preferably l l0 by weight of the 5 substituted hydantoin or preferably 0.l 50 by weight of the N carbamyl derivative of an amino acid in the reaction mixture. The reaction of the invention may be conveniently carried out at a pH of from 4 to ll, preferably from 6 to 9. Reaction conditions outside these ranges are inefficient in practice in view of the enzyme activity and stability. The pH may vary as the reaction proceeds and, accordingly, the pH should be maintained at a desired value by the addition of an appropriate neutralizing agent. The reaction temperature may be from l5 to 50 C. In addition, a small amount, e.g. 0.l l0 mM, of a metal ion, provided by compounds such as MnCl₂ and CoCl₂ will give better results. The L amino acid produced can be separated from the reaction mixture, for example by centrifuging the mixture to remove insolubles such as the cells, passing the supernatant through a strong acid H type cation exchange resin to adsorb the L amino acids followed by elution with aqueous ammonia, and further concentrating and cooling to deposit crystals. According to the present invention, L amino acids can be produced very efficiently from 5 substituted hydantoins or N carbamyl derivatives of amino acids, irrespective of the D , L or DL form of the starting materials. The invention is now further described in the following Examples. In these Examples, the percentages are by weight unless otherwise noted. A medium containing 0.5 glucose, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.l disodium hydrogenphosphate, 0.05 potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05 magnesium sulfate, having a pH of 7.5, was distributed into a number of test tubes and sterilized at l20 C for l5 minutes. DL N carbamyltryptophan which had also been sterilized was added to each test tube to provide a final concentration of 0.05 . To the cultured medium there was added each of the 5 substituted hydantoins listed in Table l below. Shaking of the culture was further continued at 30 C for 24 hours. After reaction the cells were removed by centrifugation. Amino acids in the supernatants were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC and a bioassay using Into a 500 ml flask there was added 100 ml of a medium containing 0.5 glucose, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.l disodium hydrogenphosphate, 0.05 potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.05 magnesium sulfate and 0.l DL 5 indolylmethylhydantoin, having a pH of 7.5. The flask was sterilized at l20 C for l5 minutes. To the flask there was inoculated 5 ml of a seed culture of The cells were suspended in l00 ml of 0.l M Tris HCl buffer, having a pH of 7.0, containing 0.2 M DL 5 benzylhydantoin and 0.5 mM cobalt chloride, and incubated at 35 C for 65 hours. After reaction the cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated to 20 ml and cooled to deposit crystals. The crystals were analyzed by TLC, HPLC, NMR and polarimetry and data corresponding to a standard specimen of L phenylalanine were obtained as shown in Table 2. Cells obtained in the same manner as Example l were suspended in 2 ml of 0.l M Tris HCl buffer, having a pH of 7.5, containing 0.5 mM cobalt chloride and l mM manganese chloride. The suspension was subjected three times to ultrasonication at 20 kHz for 3 minutes while cooling in an ice bath. D 5 benzylhydantoin was added 0.l M to the suspension containing the cell debris, which was then incubated at 35 C for 40 hours. After reaction insolubles were centrifuged out, L phenylalanine was obtained from the supernatant with a yield of 82 . Identities of the product were confirmed by HPLC and bioassay. A medium, having a pH of 7.0, containing 0.5 glucose, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.l disodium hydrogenphosphate, 0.05 potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05 magnesium sulfate, was distributed into a number of test tubes in an amount of 5 ml in each test tube, and sterilized at 120 C for l5 minutes. DL N carbamyltryptophan, which had also been sterilized, was added to each of the tubes to provide a final concentration of 0.l . Cells collected from the medium by centrifugation were washed with the same amount of saline and suspended in 5 ml of 0.l M Tris HCl buffer, having a pH of 7.5, containing 0.l mM manganese chloride and 0.l M L N carbamylamino acid, each of which is listed in Table 3 below. The reaction was carried out at 35 C for 20 hours. Quantitative measurements of the products by bioassay with Cells which had been obtained by the same manner as in Example 4 except for using 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing l00 ml of the medium were suspended in l00 ml of 0.l M Tris HCl buffer, having a pH of 7.0, containing 0.l M D N carbamylamino acid listed in Table 4 below, 0.5 mM cobalt chloride and l mM manganese chloride, and incubated at 35 C for 60 hours. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed that the reaction had been almost completed in this procedure. After centrifugation to remove the cells, the supernatant was concentrated to 25 ml, and about 5 ml ethanol was added and cooled to 5 C to deposit crystals. The crystals were recrystallized and analyzed by HPLC, TLC, bioassay, NMR and polarimetry. Comparisons of the obtained data with those of standard specimens of the corresponding L amino acids confirmed the identities of the products shown in Table 4. The procedures of Example 5 were repeated except that D N carbamylamino acids were replaced by DL N carbamylamino acids. The analysis results of the obtained products corresponded with those of standard specimens, as shown in Table 5. Cells obtained in the same manner as in Example 5 were suspended in 20 ml of 0.l M Tris HCl buffer, having a pH of 7.0, containing 0.5 mM cobalt chloride and l mM manganese chloride. The suspension was subjected three times to ultrasonication at 20 kHz for 3 minutes under cooling in an ice bath. DL N carbamylamino acid was added to the cell debris solution in a concentration of 0.l M and incubated at 30 C for 20 hours. After reaction insolubles were removed by centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was analyzed by HPLC and bioassay. The products were identified as corresponding L amino acids on the basis of the results of the analyses shown in Table 6.
