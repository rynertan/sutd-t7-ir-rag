# Poly butylene terephthalate based moulding resins.

## Abstract
There is provided an improved moulding resin especially for use in high temperature environments for example metallic electrical assemblies the resin is capable of being moulded into an article exhibiting reduced tendency to cor rode a copper surface when the moulded resin and the copper surface are placed in spaced relationship in a common unven tilated atmosphere at elevated temperatures, as measured by the Bell Telephone Laboratories Copper Corrosion Test at temperatures within the range from 150 to 175 C. wherein the moulding resin comprises the combination of a a po ly butylene terephthalate based polymer and aromatic halogen groups in a flame retardant amount, and b an alkylhydroxyphenyl alkanoyl hydrazine in an amount that is within the range from 0.05 to 0.6 by weight, based on the weight of the moulding resin, and less than 0.8 by weight based on the polymer.
