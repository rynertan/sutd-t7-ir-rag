# Microcode control system for digital data processing system.

## Abstract
A microcode control system for a digital data processor. The processor sequentially processes data in response to a microinstruction in a data processing path including a plurality of successive processing stages. A control path parallels the data processing path and includes a plurality of stage which transfer the microinstruction in synchronism with the transfer of data through the data processing path. At each stage in the control path, the microinstruction is decoded to determine the operation to be performed in response thereto on the data by the stage in the data processing path and control signals are generated to control the processing by the stage in the data processing path.
