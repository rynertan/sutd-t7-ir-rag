# Method of justification in a printer controlled by a host processor.

## Abstract
In a printing system comprising a printer controlled by a host processor 11 , a system of justification is provided therein the determination of justification parameters is shared by the host processor 11 and the printer formatting processor 12 . Justification means in the host processor 11 determine which spaces in a line are to be altered to effect justification. Means are provided for conveying data from the host processor to the printer indicating which spaces in a particular line are to be so altered, and means are provided in the printer for determining the size of the indicated spaces necessary to effect such a justification.
