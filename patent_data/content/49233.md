## Abstract
A drying device intended for drying material bearing print issuing from a printing machine consisting of a conveyor 4 for the material and adjacent heat emitting elements 11 . A flow of air 12 is so arranged as to pass over the conveyor 4 for the material, thereby absorbing volatile substances released by the ink on the material during the drying process. The speed of the flow of air 12 is set in relation to the level of volatile substances in a specific quantity of exhaust air 12a . The level of volatile substances is monitored continuously by a device 13 which is connected to a measuring instrument 14 , the output signal of which controls a motor which adjusts the setting of a throttle valve 17 , so that the concentration of volatile substances inside the drying device will be kept at or immediately below a maximum permissible value, thereby achieving considerable savings in energy.
