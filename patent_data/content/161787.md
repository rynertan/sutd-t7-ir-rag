# Mould and process for manufacturing helical shaped items.

## Abstract
A mould and process for integrally forming from a selected material a helical shaped device which includes an axial member 33 integrally joined with a helical shaped flight member 41 is disclosed. The helical flight member 41 extends a selected radial distance from the axial member 33 and encloses up to 360 degrees of the axial member. The mould has a centre operating axis 26 and includes a first section 20A which partially defines an elongated cavity portion 34A which forms a portion of the axial member 33 . The first section 20A further defines a helical surface 36A which is disposed coaxially around and along the centre axis 26 and extends a selected distance radially from the centre axis for an amount of rotation no greater than 360 degrees. This surface forms one of the front and back surfaces of the helical shaped flight member 41 . In a similar manner, a second section 20B is adapted for reciprocating movement along the centre axis 26 between an open and closed position with respect to section 20A . The second section 20B also defines the elongated cavity portion 34B and a helical shaped surface 36B disposed around the cavity portion of section 20B . The helical shaped surface of section 20B forms the other one of the front and back surfaces of the helical shaped flight member 41 , such that when the two sections 20A and 20B are in the closed position, the helical surfaces of each section of the mould are parallel to and are maintained a selected distance apart. Thus, the two mould sections define a substan tially enclosed cavity having an elongated axial portion and a helical shaped flight portion with a selected cross section. It is this cavity when filled with a selected liquid material that may be cured such that it holds its shape that forms the helical shaped device. At least onen of the two sections 20A and 20B define a gate or port 48 which extends from the outside of the mould to the internal cavity such that the selected liquid material may be transferred into the interior portion of the mould for forming the helical shaped device. In a preferred embodiment, there is also included a centre rod member 62 which is coaxial with the axial cavity 34A and operates so that when withdrawn from the cavity it provides an aperture in the resulting axial member 33 of the helical shaped device. In addition, the mould and technique may be used to form helical shaped devices having more than one flight member so long as each flight member does not overlap another flight member.
