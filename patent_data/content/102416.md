## Description
BLENDS OF EGG ALBUMEN AND WHEY PROTEIN EVIDENCINGIMPROVED GEL STRENGTH The present invention relates to dry blends of egg albumen and whey proteins which evidence improved gel strength and processes for preparing the same.Background of the Present Invention Dried egg albumen is a well known conunercial product. Albumen, after separation from yolk, is subjected to a desugaring step to avoid browning upon drying. Desugaring is generally accomplished by treating egg albumen with bacteria such as EnterobacterAerogenes which consume the glucose in the egg. The desugared egg albumen is then dried such as by pan drying or spray drying. The details are more fully set forth in the Science and Technology of Egg ProductsManufactured in the United States, Forsythe R. 1968 publisher . Since it is well known that egg albumen is a perfect breeding ground for various bacteria including the highly toxic salmonella, the product must be pasteurized before distribution and sale.One of the effective pasteurization means is termed Hot Room Treatment . In this treatment the dried egg albumen in closed containers is placed in a clean sealed room, the containers being spaced sufficiently to assure adequate heat penetration and air circulation. Spray dried albumen is heated throughout to a temperature of not less than 54C 130SF and held continuously at such temperature for not less than five days and until it is salmonella negative. Pan dried albumen is heated throughout to a temperature of not less than 525C 1250F. and held continuously at such temperature for not less than five days and until salmonella negative. This is set forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations governing the inspection of eggs and egg products 7 CFR 59.575 .An average treatment time is two weeks. Much experimental work has been conducted to determine the effect of this type of pasteurization on the content of salmonella and the functional properties of the egg albumen. In the article entitled The Effect of High Temperature Storage on the Content of Salmonella and on the FunctionalProperties of Dried Egg White by G. J. Banwart andJ. C. Ayres, Food Technology 10 68 73, it is indicated that albumen containing 1.5, 3 or 6 moisture stored for 150, 120 and 90 days respectively at 50 CC. provided good salmonella control without any significant loss in the volume of angel cakes.Albumen with 12 moisture showed a significant decrease in the volume of resulting angel cakes when stored for three days. Of similar import are the papers entitled High Temperature Storage ofSpray Dried Egg White , No. 1, Whipping Time andQuality of Angel Cake, by R. E. Baldwin et al.,Poultry Science 46 1421 1430 High TemperatureStorage of Spray Dried Egg White , No. 2,Electrophoretic mobility, Conalbumen Iron Complexing, Sulfhydryl Activity, and Evolution of Volatile Bases, by 0. J. Cotterill, Poultry Science 46 1431 1437 Spray Drying of Egg White at Various pH Levels by W. M. Hill, Poultry Science 44 1155 1163 and High Temperature Storage of Spray Dried Egg White by L. E. McBee et al., Poultry Science 50, No. 2 pages 452 458. It is also well known to prepare various products from whey, the by product of cheese manufacture. The products that can be obtained from whey include, among others, a whey protein concentrate. Whey protein concentrates can be made by numerous methods including gel fractionation U.S.Re. 27,806 as well as by ultrafiltration. An illustrative method for ultrafiltration is described by Horton, B. S. et al., Food Technology, Volume 26, page 30 1972 . Whey protein concentrate generally has about 35 to about 80 protein. Oneoftheproteinsin the whey protein concentrate is a water soluble protein of the albumenoid class of proteins.Because some of the protein in whey protein concentrate is from the same class as that of egg albumen, workers thought that one of the obvious areas of use of this lower cost protein would be in extending egg albumen. Various workers have attempted to substitute whey protein concentrate for egg albumen in various recipes. Depending on the functionality for which the eggs were used, the richness in eggs of the recipe and the type of whey protein concentrate used, sucesses have been sporadic. In attempting to make a hard whipped meringue, whey protein concentrate from ultrafiltration is not entirely satisfactory. In general, the critical test for the substitution is the preparation of angel cake and it is not known whether or not any whey protein can be used as a substitute for egg albumen either alone or partially around 50 .Various prior processes for preparing wegg white substitutes are disclosed in the prior art discussion in U.S. Patent 4,089,987. In general, the replacements on a functional basis cannot be accomplished without the addition of secondary ingredients such as carboxymethylcellulose or the materials disclosed in 4,089,987. In the past blends of egg albumen and whey protein concentrate have been made in a recipe by partially replacing egg albumen. This is generally accomplished using either liquid or dried egg albumen and a whey protein concentrate. One of the unique properties of egg albumen is its ability to form a stable gel at a relatively low temperature. A 15 solution of a desugared spray dried egg albumen which has been hot room treated as standard in the industry will provide a gel by heating the solution to a temperature of about 700C.for about 30 minutes. It is also possible to gel a whey protein concentrate by heating a solution of 15t whey protein for 30 minutes at 850cm Relative gel strengths for the respective products are about 90 grams and 450 grams respectively as tested with a penetrometer. In attempting to provide blends of egg albumen and whey protein concentrate for use as gel forming material, it was discovered that the gels provided by the blends are weaker than that provided by the weakest component used alone. The same result is achieved when the whey protein concentrate is mixed with the egg and then hot room treated or if the whey protein concentrate is hot room treated prior to it mixing with the spray dried egg white. In both cases the product would brown and be unacceptable.These findings severely limit the use of whey protein concentrate as a blend with egg albumen in areas where the gelling function of the egg albumen is of significance. Brief Summary of the Invention In accorddnce with the present invention, it has been found that the gel strength of blends of whey containing materials and dried egg albumen at temperatures below 85 C. in a 15 solution for 30 minutes can be improved by subjecting desugared dried pasteurized egg albumen to treatment in the hot room for a period of time ranging from above about two weeks to about eight weeks counting beyond the time the heat history of the egg albumen has been above about 550C, This includes any pasteurization procedure in the hot room.Preferably, the hot room treatment is conducted for a period of time of about three to about six weeks and more preferably about five weeks 0.5 week, This material when blended with the whey protein concentrate, provides a gel strength higher than the blend of the normal pasteurized egg albumen and thus sufficiently high to be commercially useful in the area of blends of whey protein and egg albumen for functional gelation uses. Whey protein concentrate can be prepared by various processes which include post treatments as will be explained more fully hereinafter.Detailed Description of the Present Invention The present invention relates to dried blends of dried egg albumen and dried whey protein material.Any commercially available dried egg albumen is effectively usable in the present invention. Preferably, the dried egg albumen is prepared by the standard process which includes desugaring of the egg albumen, pan or spray drying followed by a sufficient hot room treatment to effect salmonella control. Procedures for preparing this type of material are well known in the industry and have been described hereinbefore. In accordance with this invention, the dried egg albumen is required to be subjected to treatment under heat for a period of time ranging above about two weeks at least 15 days to about eight weeks, the time including any heat treatment used for pasteurization. In general, the apparatus and conditions used for hot room treatment pasteurization are also effective in treatment of the egg albumen for purposes of the invention. The dried egg albumen can be purchased commercially and then subjected to a heat treatment or the egg albumen can be subjected to a complete heat treatment for the entire period without a cool down period in between.In either case, the egg albumen as obtained will effectively provide, when combined with the whey protein concentrate, a product of a gel strength superior to that of a blend of a whey protein concentrate and a pasteurized dried egg algumen without extended heat treatment. The amount of heating depends on the time the dried product has been heated above 550C. The heat history is not intended to include the heat needed for drying. Thus, the dry egg albumen can be heated above 550C. for the pasteurization period, cooled down and reheated or the dry egg albumen can be heated continuously for a period sufficient to pasteurize and heat treat in accordance with the invention. The heat treatment must be sufficiently long at. the temperature used to raise the gel strength above about 250 grams over the gel strength of the dried egg albumen prior to pasteuriation. Higher temperatures provide higher gel strengths. In other words, equivalent gels strength can be reached in shorter time using higher temperature than using lower temperature and longer time.It is preferred that the heating temperatures range from about 550C. to about 65 DC. Extended heating beyond eight weeks has not been found to provide any beneficial results. The whey protein containing composition for use in the present invention preferably contains from about 358 to about 80t dairy derived protein on a dry solids basis. Of that dairy derived protein, at least 50 , preferably at least 75 , more preferably at least 908 and most preferably 100 of the protein is whey protein. The whey protein is generally provided by a whey protein concentrate at least 35 protein .On a solids basis, the whey protein containing composition is preferably comprised of at least 50g and preferably from about 75 to about 100 of a whey protein concentrate having at least 35 protein, from 50 to about 0 and preferably from 25 to about 0 of another dairy protein containing composition including other whey protein containing compositions. The whey protein concentrate as well as other whey protein containing products used in the present invention can be derived from cheese whey, casein whey and soy whey and preferably cheese whey. Cheese whey is the by product of the acid or rennet coagulation of protein casein from milk. Sweet whey or cheddar whey is obtained by the separation and removal of coagulated casein produced by the addition of a proteolytic enzyme to milk.The proteolytic enzymes generally used are known as rennin and or pepsin. Specific examples of cheese products produced by this method include cheddar cheese, swiss cheese and mozzarella. Acid or cottage cheese whey is the by product obtained from the acid coagulation of milk protein by the use of lactic acid producing bacteria e.g., lactobacillus or by the addition of food grade acids such as lactic or hydrochloric acid, i.e., direct acidification, In either case, acidification is allowed to proceed until a pH of approximately 4.6 is reached. At this pH, casein becomes insolubilized and coagulates as cheese curd. The whey protein concentrate as used in the invention can be derived from 100 acid cheese whey though minor amounts of other cheese wheys of less than 50 and preferably less than 20 can be utilized. Such other cheese wheys include but are not limited to cheddar cheese whey. The whey protein concentrate used in the invention can be prepared by any one of a number of known processes including electrodialysis Stribley, R. C.,Food Processing, Volume 24, No. 1, page 49, 1963 , reverse osmosis, Marshall, P. G. et al., Fractionation and Concentration of Whey by Reverse Osmosis,Food Technology, 22 a , 696, 1968 , gel filtration U.S. Pat. No. Re. 27,806 or by ultrafiltration Horton, B.S. et al., Food Technology, Volume 26, page 30, 1972 . Chemical methods including the phosphate percipitation of whey protein can also be used as described in Gordon U. S. Patent No.2,388,624 and Melachouris U.S. Patent No. 4,043,990.Products such as lactalbumen phosphate are also to be considered whey protein concentrates. The whey protein concentrate should contain at least 35 protein based on total Kjeldahl nitrogen. For example, an ultrafiltered acid cottage cheese whey concentrate containing from about 40 to about 60 and preferably about 45 to about 55 whey protein can be used in the invention. In a typical process, cottage cheese whey is neutralized to a pH of about 6.4 with 50 caustic. After storage, the pE is then adjusted to about 7.2 and any solids or precipitates are removed by centrifugal clarifiers. The clarified liquor is then pasteurized. The liquor is then fed into an ultrafiltration membrane unit. The retentate is condensed and spray dried.Protein products containing 35 or more whey protein can be prepared by this process. Products generally comprising from about 40 to about 60 protein TKN x 6.38 , 10 30 lactose, 3 15 ash, and 0.1 4 fat are obtained. The dried retentate with the aforegiven composition is considered a whey protein concentrate. While it is preferred to use the whey protein concentrate in the dry form, the liquid form can also be used on a percent by weight solids basis, when blending of the whey protein concentrate and the dry heat treated albumen is accomplished during the formulation of the final product in which the blend is used. Liquid levels in the final formulation are adjusted to the correct solid liquid ratio. Liquid whey protein concentrate must be kept under refrigeration to prevent spoilage. The whey protein concentrate can also be combined with another protein containing whey based product such as dried whey, delactosed whey, delactosed demineralized whey where demineralization is accomplished by any known method such as electrodialysis, ion exchange or material transfer ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis , as well as the dried mother liquor clarified whey remaining after separation of the precipitates prepared in accordance with United States patentsNos. 3,560,219 and 4,036,999. Other non whey based dairy protein compositions which can be used include milk and milk solids, e.g.NFDM, casein and caseinates including sodium, potassium and calcium caseinate. The whey protein concentrate can also be post treated after separation to vary the properties of the composition. Specifically, the thermal gellation temperature of the whey protein concentrate can be reduced by an alkaline heat treatment. In this process a whey protein concentrate has its pH elevated to within the range of 8 to 10 and preferably around 9 to 9.5 and is heated within the range of from about 700C. to about 77.5 C. preferably from about 72.5 to about 750C. and immediately cooled down such that the heating is maintained for no longer then about 60 and preferably 15 seconds. The pH can be adjusted down to neutral as desired. The strength of the gels prepared with the blends depends on the quantity of egg albumen replaced.As the quantity of egg albumen in the blend decreases so does the strength of the gels provided. Effective results have been found utilizing from about 50 to about 85 egg albumen and conversely at least about 15 whey protein concentrate and preferably from about 50 to about 15 whey protein concentrate with about 75 egg albumen and about 25 whey protein concentrate being more preferred. The blends of the present invention can be made by dry blending the ingredients and selling the blend If the blend is to be used as part of a dry mix for preparing a food, the blending can be accomplished during preparation of the mix. The two separate components of the blend can also be added during the preparation of the food in which the blend is to be used. Blending can be conducted on the dry materials or reliquified materials. Only the egg albumen must be processed to a dry stage at some time during its processing history. The products of the present invention can be used in any area where the gellation properties of egg albumen are significant. These include binding comminuted meat and fish.It is to be noted that the process of the present invention is particularly significant in providing effective gels at. the lowest possible gellation temperatures to save on energy costs as well as not consuming excess time. The higher the gellation temperature used in preparing the gels the less distinction is seen between compositions. The invention will be more fully illustrated in the examples which follow. EXAMPLE 1 Commercially available desugared dried egg albumen which had received two weeks of heat treatment at 600C. was subjected to additional heat treatment for various periods of time. A 2.25 kilo package of commercial pasteurized dried egg albumen was placed in an oven at 550C. Samples were removed from the box at various periods of time. The gel strength of blends of 758 egg albumen and 25 whey protein concentrate which had been heated in a 16.5 solution at a pH of 8.7 to a temperature of 75.50C. for 16 seconds, cooled and neutralized were determined. Gel conditions are given in table, heating time was thirty minutes. The gelation test involved dissolving the test protein in an appropriate quantity of water to obtain the desired percent total solids or percent total protein.The product of the invention and the control were tested in solutions containing 10 15 total solids and about 7 10 protein. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 with a minimum amount of acid HC1 or base NaOH . Thirty five grams of solution was weighed into a 35 cm x 45 cm diameter glass dish.The dish was covered with plastic film and a watch glass. The glass dish was lowered into a hot water bath for thirty minutes, from the time the dish was placed into the bath. After thirty minutes, the dish was placed in a refrigerator immediately after heating and held overnight. The gel strength is determined by allowing the temperature of the gel to reach room temperature 250C., a water bath can be used for this purpose and then inverting the gel on the scale of a Marine Colloids gel tester slow speed and small plunger . The amount of force in grams required to break the center of the gel is then determined. The results are shown in the following table TABLE 1 Extra Gel Strength gramsStorage Time 700C 15T.S, 90 C 10 T.S. 0 weeks 20 120 1 128 135 2 125 145 3 243 185 4 240 200 5 245 220Commercial Egg 90 180 Albumen alone Whey Protein 163 Concentrate alone t Experiments run at different times than experiments providing the main data for the Table. As can be seen from the data, a blend of commercial dried egg albumen pasteurized for two weeks in a hot room and whey protein concentrate provided gel strength at 700C. of 20 whereas commercial pasteurized egg albumen alone provided a gel strength of 90 and whey protein concentrate a gel strength of 163. Blends of commercial dried egg albumen and whey protein concentrate provide gel strengths lower than either ingredient alone. By the process of the invention, it is possible to provide blends which equal and even surpass the gel strength of the component providing the greatest gel strength. EXAMPLE 2 Various whey protein concentrates were used with various lots of commercially heat treated desugared dried egg albumen. Heat treatment of the egg albumen was conducted under plant conditions of 600C. for a total of four or five weeks 2 3 weeks extra .
