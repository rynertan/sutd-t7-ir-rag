# Process for the preparation of alpha substituted thien 3 ylacetic acid and derivatives thereof.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of 3 substituted thiophenes which involves cyclisation of a novel intermediate, avoids the use of previously employed expensive starting materials. The thiophenes are useful for the preparation of penicillins and cephalosporins. The process is for the preparation of a thiophene of formula I
