# Unitized wheel bearing seal assembly.

## Abstract
A unitized wheel bearing seal assembly includes inner and outer metal casings 40,38 having respective cylindrical walls 50,42 press fitted between inner and outer concentric cylindrical surfaces 30,28 respectively in a wheel bearing 10 to seal a lubricant space. The outer cylindrical surface 28 is stationary, and the inner metal casing 40 has a radially extending outer annular flange 52 . A two lip unsprung seal 56 extends from the inner casing, with one lip 60 engaging the annular flange and the other 58 engaging the cylindrical wall of the inner casing, each at an acute angle, with a lubricant containing cavity 72 formed between them. This orientation allows the lips to flex away to allow pressure egress from the lubricant space, but prevents flexing in the other direction and so blocks the ingress of contaminants from ambient. The spinning annular flange also acts as a slinger to prevent contaminant entry.
