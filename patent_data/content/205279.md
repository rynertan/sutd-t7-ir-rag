## Description
NON TOXIC OPHTHALMIC PREPARATIONS AND METHODS OF PREPARING THEMt1 This invention relates to ophthalmic preparations for application to the ocular surface and methods of making the preparations. More particularly, the invention relates to ophthalmic preparations that permit essentially normal maintenance of ocular surface mucuscontaining goblet cells. The conjunctival epithelium of the eye contains mucus containing goblet cells. These cells secrete mucus in a controlled fashion. They thereby form a major element of the biological system by which the surface of the eye protects itself from harmful foreign matter, including but not limited to infectious agents.The goblet cells also form a critical layer of the tear film of the eye that protects the surface of the eye from dessication. Furthermore, the mucus contained within these goblet cells is a major natural lubricant for the ocular surface. The presence of a normal density of goblet cells is important for the maintenance of a healthy ocular surface. Medicamentosa is a disease of the surface of the eye caused by the frequent administration to the eye of topical medications and or solutions. The disease can cause ocular irritation, photophobia, conjunctival infection and keratitis. The cause of this disease has been unclear. It now has been found, however, that exposing the surface of the eye to standard ophthlamic solutions results in an accelerated loss of mucus from the conjunctival goblet cells. This loss of mucus leaves the ocular surface with an abnormally low density of mucus containing goblet cells. This abnormal loss of goblet cell mucus is a manifestation of toxicity of the solution that was used. It is now postulated that one mechanism responsible for the development of medicamentosa is the gradual, progressive depletion of goblet cell mucus that the exposure to standard ophthlamic solutions induces. Derangement of goblet cell mucus can decrease the eye s ability to rid itself of harmful foreign material, can engender dessication of the ocular surface, and can decrease lubrication of the surface. For example, solutions designed to lubricate the eye in fact work against that intention when they deplete the eye of goblet cell mucus a most important natural lubricant. It is desirable to minimize the toxicity of ophthalmic preparations. What is needed is an essentially non toxic ophthalmic preparation which satisfies the fluid and electrolyte requirements of the ocular surface. The composition of tear fluid has been determined to include proteins, enzymes, lipids, metabolites and electrolytes. The proteins include tear albumin, lysozyme, lactoferrin, transferrin, caeruloplasmin, immunoglobulins, complement, glycoproteins and antiproteinases. The enzymes include glycolytic enzymes and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as lactate dehydrogenase, lysosomal enzymes, amylase, peroxidase, plasminogen activator and collagenase.The lipids include cholestrol, though lipids from other lipid classes are present. The metabolites include glucose, lactate, urea, catecholamines, histamine, and prostaglandins. The electrolytes include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride and bicarbonate. Objects of this invention include the provision of an ophthalmic preparation which permits essentially normal maintenance of ocular surface mucus containing goblet cells, and which is essentially non toxic.Desirably, the preparation is suited for the improved treatment of the spectrum of dry eye disorders.Another object is to provide a preparation for selectively increasing or decreasing tear film osmolarity. A preparation according to the invention advantageously is suitable selectively for contact lens adaptation, for use as a vehicle for medicaments, and for eye comfort in general. An ophthalmic preparation according to the invention may serve as an irrigation fluid and or drug vehicle in patients with extensive lacrimal gland and or excretory duct destruction and or other ocular diseases where continuous or nearlycontinuous ocular irrigation and or drug therapy is desirable. A synthetic preparation for ophthalmic use has been developed that has an enhanced ability to permit essentially normal maintenance of ocular surface mucus containing goblet cells. The preparation leaves the conjunctiva of eyes white and non swollen, even after prolonged bathing, e.g., for twelve hours. The preparation is non toxic and contains a combination of electrolytes found in natural tear fluid and satisfies requirements of the ocular surface. In preferred formulations, the synthetic preparation is substantially free of histamines. In other formulations, the preparation is substantially free of immunoglobulins, complement, desquamated epithelial cells, bacteria and or microorganisms. In general, the preparation consists principally of major amounts of sodium and of chloride, and of lesser amounts of potassium and of bicarbonate. It preferably also contains other naturally occurring elements.Other constitutents may be present depending on the particular purpose of the final preparation, e.g., as a lubricating ointment, or as a medicament for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular surface infections. Acording to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a synthetic non toxic ophthalmic preparation of selected osmolality containing potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sodium, said preparation comprising a between about 22.0 to 43.0, preferably between about 23.0 to 42.0, millimoles of potassium per liter, b between about 29.0 to 50.0, preferably between about 31.0 and 48.0, millimoles of bicarbonate per liter, c between about 130.0 to 140.0, preferably between 131.0 to 139.0, millimoles of sodium per liter, and d between about 118.0 to 136.5, preferably between 124.0 to 136.0, millimoles of chloride per liter. While the invention is not limited thereby, it is desirable to includes calcium, magnesium, and phosphate in the solution. The desirable effects of these elements on living cells are well known. See, for example, the following publications Edelhauser et al, Am J Ophthalmol, 81 473, 1976 Kaye et al,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 7 53, 1968 Edelhauser et al, Arch Ophthalmol, 93 648, 1975 Edelhauser et al,Arch Ophthalmol, 96 516, 1978 Merrill et al, Am J Ophthalmol, 49 895, 1960.The preferred concentrations are between about 0.5 to 2.0 mMoles liter of calcium, between about 0.3 to 1.1 mMoles liter of magnesium, and between about 0.8 to 2.2 mMoles liter of phosphate. More optimal is a calcium concentration between about 0.6 to 0.8 riiMoles liter, a magnesium concentration between about 0.5 to 0.6 mMoles liter and a phosphate concentration between about 1.0 and 2.0 mMoles liter. The preferred resulting solution has a pH value between about 7.0 and 8.0 as measured with a Fisher pHAccumet Model 600 . Nevertheless, this pH range need not be rigidly adhered to, and it may be desirable to alter pH outside of this range, for instance to improve ophthalmic drug penetration through the ocular surface. Those skilled in the art may, in view of the teachings herein, employ other pH ranges. In preferred embodiments the preparation is isotonic. However the final osmolality may be adjusted according to the conditions present in the tear film or on the ocular surface. For example, treatment of hypertonic tear films may make diluted preparations preferable. Alternatively, the preparation may be concentrated to hypertonic concentration when therapeutically desirable such as in topical formulations for the treatment of recurrent corneal erosions.The preparations may be concentrated or diluted while minimizing undesirable properties or untoward effects of final preparation by maintaining the preferred ratios of the described electrolytes of the final ophthalmic preparations Also according to the invention, there is provided a synthetic non toxic ophthalmic preparation of selected osmolality containing potassium, chloride, bicarbonate and sodium, the preparation having a ratio of potassium to bicarbonate in the range of 1 0.6 to 1 2.3 mMoles liter and a preferred range of 1 .7 to 1 2.1 potassium to sodium in the range of 1 3.0 to 1 6.4 mMolesXliter and a preferred range of 1 3.1 to 1 6.0 and potassium to chloride in the range of 1 2.7 to 1 6.2 mMoles liter and a preferred ratio of 1 2.9 to 1 5.9.In other formulations according to the invention, the preparation also contains one or more of calcium, magnesium and phosphate ions, when the ratio of potassium to calcium is in the range of 1 0.01 to 1 0.09 mMoles liter and a preferred ratio is 1 0.01 to 1 0.04 potassium to magnesium is in the range of 1 0.005 to 1 0.05 mMoles liter and a preferred ratio is 1 0.01 to 1 0.03 and potassium to phosphate is in the range of 1 0.015 to 1 0.1 mMoles liter and a preferred ratio is 1 0.02 to 1 0.09. The preparation may be administered to the ocular surface by various methods. For example, the preparation may be applied topically to the ocular surface as in drops, ointments, or gels. The preparation may also be applied by means of an eye cup such that the eye is bathed. In addition, the preparation may be used with a continuous or nearly continuous infusion device for ocular surface irrigation and or wetting and or drug delivery. The preparations have broad ophthalmic utility by themselves, as well as in combination with pharmaceutically and or physically active components when it is desirable to utilize topical therapy in the eye while minimizing ocular surface toxicity. For a fuller understanding of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings the description and drawings are given by way of non limitative explanation of the invention. In the drawings, Figure 1 shows comparative features of the invention in the form of a graph of the percentage mucus containing goblet cells remaining after bathing for 12 hours, relative to certain controls, as a function of potassium concentration Figure 2 shows comparative features of the invention in the form of a graph of the percentage mucus containing goblet cells remaining after bathing for 12 hours, relative to the controls, as a function of bicarbonate concentration Figure 3 shows comparative features of the invention in the form of a graph of the percentage mucus containing goblet cells remaining after bathing for 12 hours, relative to the controls, as a function of sodium concentration and Figure 4 shows comparative features of the invention in the form of a graph of the percentage mucus containing goblet cells remaining after bathing for 12 hours, relative to the controls, as a function cf chloride concentration. The invention further provides a method for preparing a synthetic non toxic ophthalmic preparation for topical application and or infusing to the human or animal ocular surface, wherein said preparation includes potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sodium, and the method comprises the steps of a providing about 22.0 to 43.0 millimoles of potassium per liter, b providing about 29.0 to 50.0 millimoles of bicarbonate per liter, providing about 130.0 to 140.0 millimoles of sodium per liter, and d providing about 118.0 to 136.5 millimoles of chloride per liter. In accordance with the invention, a non toxic ophthalmic preparation combines multiple components to form a preparation which can be topically applied to the ocular surface by whichever of various methods is desired. The non toxic ophthalmic preparation of the invention is prepared to attain between about 22.0 to 43.0 mMoles liter of potassium, 118.0 to 136.5 mMoles liter of chloride, 29.0 to 50.0 mMolesSliter of bicarbonate, 130.0 to 140.0 mMoles liter of sodium, 0.5 to 2.0 mMoles liter of calcium, 0.3 to 1.1 mMoles liter of magnesium, and 0.8 to 2.2 mMoles liter of phosphate. Although it is generally desirable for the preparations to be essentially isotonic, the final osmolality or tonicity of the solution may vary.Indeed, since hypotonic and hypertonic eyedrops are brought rapidly to isotonicity by the exit or entrance, respectively, of water from the tear film, as first demonstrated by Maurice Exp Eye Res 11, 30, 1971 , and as later confirmed directly by Holly andLamberts Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 20, 236, 1981 , the preferred embodiment may be diluted to hypotonic concentrations when this is therapeutically desirable. One instance occurs in the treatment of elevated tear film osmolarity, such as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,371,522. The preparation may also be concentrated to hypertonic concentrations when therapeutically desirable, such as in topical formulations for the treatment of recurrent corneal erosions. The preferred resulting solution has a pH value between about 7.0 and 8.0 as measured with aFisher pH Accumet Model 600 . Nevertheless, this pH range need not be rigidly adhered to, and it may be desirable to alter pH outside of this range, for instance to improve ophthalmic drug penetration through the ocular surface. Those skilled in the art may, in view of the teachings herein, employ other pH ranges. The effect of various ophthalmic preparations on mucus containing goblet cell density has been examined and can be further understood from the following experiments and results. It is recognized that results of tests using rabbits has close correlation with humans and therefore the results carry over to humans. In vivo tests of various ophthalmic preparations, some according to the invention, and some according to prior art, were carried out in anesthetized rabbits. Their lids were elevated with sutures attached to elevated posts to form a conjunctival well. In separate experiments the well was filled with test solutions such that the entire ocular surface was submerged. One eye of each rabbit was bathed with a test solution, the other eye was not treated and served as a control. Baths were exchanged every hour for a twelve hour period with fresh solution that had been bubbled with air. At the completion of the twelve hour period, four conjunctival biopsies were taken from the eye that had been bathed, as well as from the contralateral control eye that had been closed for the twelve hour period. Biopsies were taken adjacent to the limbus with a 5 mm trephine blade in the superotemporal, superonasal, inferotemporal and inferonasal quadrants. In some experiments only two biopsies were taken from each eye. Tissue was mounted flat and stained for mucus containing goblet cells with PAS. Goblet cells were counted in eight 0.3 square mm contiguous squares beginning immediately at the limbal margin of the biopsy and counting peripherally in the direction of the conjunctival fornices. Goblet cell densities were averaged for each eye and compared to the average density in the contra lateral control eye. Tests were run with twelve solutions, five of which are known solutions and seven of which were prepared according to the invention. The known solutions which were tested and which are further described below included Unisol TM , Balanced SaltSolution R , Lactated Ringer s Solution, Graeme S.Wilson s Solution, and Medium 199. The solutions prepared according to the invention are ExampleSolutions A G, the constituents and properties of which are further described in Table II.

The percentage mucus containing goblet cells remaining is high not only for solutionsA F, which contain potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, sodium phosphate and bicarbonate, but is also high for solution G, which contains only potassium, chloride, sodium and bicarbonate. The results from tests carried out using the various known and Example Solutions are also indicated in Figures 1 4. The figures demonstrate the percent of mucus containing goblet cells remaining as a function of the concentration of particular constituents in the various solutions. As can be seen in the Figures, varying the concentrations of the constituents significantly affects the percentage of mucus containing goblet cells remaining. While the invention is not limited thereby, the described ophthalmic preparations can be used as an artificial tear solution, as an ocular wetting solution, as a drug vehicle, as a solution for increasing eye comfort, as a contact lens wetting solution, as well as a contact lens soaking solution. The preparations can be administered to the eye according to conventional practices, including topically as a drop, in an ointment, and as a gel. It can also be applied to the eye via an eye cup, or infused into the tear film on a continuous or nearly continuous basis with a pump and catheter type of system. In the foregoing examples, the solvent was water which is generally the preferred solvent, but other solvents can be used. Other eye preparations such as ointments or gels may require other solvents, for example petroleum derivatives such as mineral oil. It will thus be seen from the preceding description that the objects of the invention are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in formulating the above preparations without departing from the scope of the invention claimed, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
