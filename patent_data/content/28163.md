An electrostatographic reproduction apparatus is dis closed which is arranged to produce automatically a pre determined number of copy sheet sets in accordance with a collated document stack. The copy sheets are compiled by compiler 82 into individual sets and stapled by stapler 84 in the upper left hand corner of each set as viewed in a reading orientation. The staple has its bridge crown por tion angularly related to the edges of a set corner, and for optimum strength for which the staple is capable, the angle is perpendicular to the diagonal of the set.
