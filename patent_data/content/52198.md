# Method of manufacturing semiconductor devices using self alignment techniques.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device includes a step of forming a film 25a doped with an emitter impurity on a predetermined surface area of a semiconduc tor layer 23 . An ion implantation blocking layer 26 is formed to cover the top and side surfaces of the doped film 25a and the exposed surface of the semiconductor layer 23 . Then, the blocking layer 26 is anisotropically etched by irradiating it with a dry etchant in a direction substantially normal to the semiconductor layer 26 . The anisotropic etching is carried out until the top surface of the doped film 25a is substantially exposed, thereby allowing a portion 26a of the blocking layer to leave surrounding the doped film and also substantially forming a base contact hole 27 defined by the exposed side surface 26b of the remaining blocking layer 26b . Subsequently, ion implantation is conducted against the semiconductor layer 23 with the remaining blocking layer 26a used as a mask, to form at least a base contact region of a high impurity concentration in a portion of the semiconductor layer 23 corresponding to the base contact hole 26 .
