## Description
DESCRIPTION GLYCEROL DERIVATIVES The present invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives. More particularly, this invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives having antagonistic effect on platelet activating factor abbreviated as PAF hereafter , hypotensive effect like PAF, inhibitory effect on phospholipase and further, inhibitory effect on growth of tumour cell or induction of differentiation, and, furthermore, this invention is concerned to the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical composition comprising them aS active ingredients. Recently, the study on the release reaction of active amine dependent on leukocyte from platelet, has been energetically carried out. As a result, a substance strongly inducing platelet aggregation was discovered and it was named asPAF cf. J. Immunol., 106, 1244 1971 , J. Exp. Med., 136, 1356 1972 and Nature, 249, 581 1974 . Thereafter, it was confirmed that PAF exists in various animals including human beings. In 1979, its chemical structure was identified cf. J.Biol. Chem., 254, 9355 1979 and C. R. Acad. Sci., Srie D Paris , 289, 1017 1979 3 and has turned out to be a mixture of two alkylphospholipids of the following general formula wherein n is 15 and 17 cf. J. Biol. Chem., 255, 5514 1980 EMI2.1 wherein n represents 15 or 17 . It was found that PAF has not only strong secretory effect on platelet aggregation known at that time, but also powerful hypotensive effect and bronchoconstricting effect as physiological effect. PAF is considered to be one of platelet aggregating factors in human beings, and further, one of substances inducing allergy and inflammation. Accordingly, there is a great possibility that compounds having antagonistic effect on PAF inhibitory effect on PAF may become an unprecedented platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent.Furthermore, PAF is considered to become a hypotensive agent without inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation by selecting hypotensive effect out of various effect. Being interested in physiological effect of PAF, we have carried out widespread investigations in order to discover compounds similar to PAF in their chemical structure and possessing antagonistic effect on PAF or hypotensive effect likePAF. We have found that the above purpose can be accomplished by glycerol derivatives which are replaced the hydroxy group at the first position of the glycerol skeleton by an alkoxy group and are replaced the hydroxy group at the third position thereof by an alkoxy group substituted by a primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary amine, preferably tertiary or quaternary amine. For example, our European Patent Publication No. 94586 discloses the compounds of the general formula EMI3.1 tb SEP SEP AÚ R11 tb SEP SEP BÚ R21 tb SEP DÚ R31 R41 tb wherein A1 is O or S , B1 is O or S , D1 is O or OCO , R11 is alkyl, R21 is hydrogen, benzyl, acyl,N substituted amido when B1 is 0 , or R21 is hydrogen,alkyl, 1 31 benzyl or alkoxy thiocarbonyl when B1 is S , R is alkylene and R41 is amino, mono or dialkyl substituted amino or trialkyl substituted ammonium , and our European Patent Publication No. 109255 discloses the compounds of the general formula EMI3.2 tb SEP O R12 tb SEP SEP R22 tb SEP SEP Aê R32 R42 tb wherein A2 is O or OCO , R12 is alkyl, R22 is azido, 32 amino, acylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino or ureido, R32 is alkylene and R42 is amino, mono or dialkyl substituted amino or trialkyl substituted ammonium . Now, we have found that by replacing an alkyl substituted amino group at the end of the third position of the glycerol skeleton hereinbefore described, by a heterocyclic group containing nitrogen atom s , new glycerol compounds are more active in antagonistic effect on PAF than glycerol compounds previously proposed, having completed this invention. On the other hand, glycerol compounds similar to those of the present invention in chemical structure are disclosed in the German Patent Publication No. 2835369 abbreviated asDE 2835369 hereafter . Broad scope of compounds is disclosed therein and the compounds of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein R13 and R23 each represents a normal alkyl or alkenyl group of 12 to 20 carbon atoms and Y and Z each represents an alkylene group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms or ..., R33 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms or ..., m, n and p each represents zero or 1 and the total number of m, n and p is zero or 1 are most related to our invention the definitions not related to our invention are removed from the above description . As understood from the above definition, NHR33 in formula A in DE 2835369 represents only a primary or secondary amine, whileEMI4.2 in the general formula I hereinafter described, of the present invention represents a heterocyclic group containing nitrogen atom s . Furthermore, the distinguished difference between the present invention and the invention disclosed in DE 2835369 is utility of glycerol compounds. That is, compounds of the present invention have antagonistic effect on PAF and hypotensive effect like PAF and, therefore, are used as platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent and anti inflammatory agent, whereas compounds in DE 2835369 have stimulating activity of production of interferon and are useful for prophylaxis of viral disease. As discussed above, the present invention is remarkably different from the invention disclosed in DE 2835369 in chemical structure and their utility. The present invention is not anticipated and not obvious from that of DE 2835369. It, furthermore, has been found that the compounds of the present invention of the general formula I have inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C. PhospholipaseA2 and phospholipase C dependent on calcium in a living body are concerned in the mechanism for the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. It is known that arachidonic acid is released by physiological stimulus and then becomes incorporated into the metabolic routes of prostaglandins and is finally metabolized to thromboxane A2 having a strong effect on platelet aggregation, to other prostaglandins or to various leukotrienes being a significant bronchostrictor in an asthmatic paroxysm.Accordingly, it is considered that compounds having an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, which are concerned in the mechanism for the release of arachidonic acid, can become a platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent, based on the inhibition of phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, having a different mechanism from PAF antagosist and further, being different from conventional non steroid anti inflammatory agents represented by aspirin based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention of the general formula I show inhibitory effect on growth of tumour cell and induction of differentiation and, therefore, may be useful as anti tumour agents. Accordingly, the present invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives of the general formula EMI6.1 wherein A represents an oxygen atom or a carbonyloxy group i.e. O CO group wherein the carbonyl group should be attached to a group R3 and the oxa group should be attached to the carbon atom at the third position of the glycerol skeleton , R1 represents an alkyl group of 6 to 22 carbon atoms, or an alkyl group of 2 to 5 carbon atoms being substituted by a phenyl group, R represents a hydroxy group, an amino group NH2 group , an azido group N3 group , an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group of 2 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkenyloxy group of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a group of the formula EMI7.1 OCOR5, OCONHR5, NHCOR5, NHCooR5 or NHCONHR5, in which R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms andR5 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, R3 represents an alkylene group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms andEMI7.2 represents a heterocyclic group, with the proviso that, when A represents the carbonyloxy group, RZ does not represent an amino group , and non toxic acid addition salts thereof.
