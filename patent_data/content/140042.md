# Digital phase lock loop circuit.

## Abstract
A digital phase lock loop PLL circuit adaptable to a hard disk drive. The PLL operable at a high speed comprises a pulse shaper for subjecting raw data pulses from the disk drive to waveform shaping, a phase comparator for producing a phase control pulse on the basis of the relative positions of a delayed reference clock VCLK pulse and each of said waveform shaped data pulses from the shaper, and a phase shifter for generating the VCLK pulse in response to the phase control pulse.
