# A process for selective preparation of secondary and tertiary aralkyl amines.

## Abstract
Secondary and tertiary aralkylamines can be prepared with good yield and selectivity by reacting an aromatic vinylic olefin, a nitrogen containing compound, and synthesis gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen or in an alternative embodiment, CO and H2O , in the presence of a catalyst comprising a ruthenium containing compound and an amide solvent at a temperature of at least 100 DEG C and a pressure of at least 1.45 MPa. Linear products are obtained preferentially under these conditions, but when a quarternary phosphonium compound is added, branched products are also obtained in good yields.

## Description
A PROCESS FOR SELECTIVE PREPARATION OF SECONDARY AND TERTIARY ARPLKYL AMINES This invention relates to an aminomethylation process, and more particularly this invention relates to the selective preparation of secondary and tertiary aralkylamines from aromatic vinylic olefins a preferred example of which is styrene , primary or secondary arines and synthesis gas, in the presence of a catalyst system com prising a ruthenium containing compound, and heating the mixture in the presence of an aide solvent at a temperature of at least 100 C and a pressure of at least 1.45 Wa, until there is substantial formation of the desired secondary or tertiary arallylamine an optionally separating said amine rroduct by a novel phase separation technique. The resulting aralkylamines are useful as surfactant type amines. The principle of obtaining amines, using olefins, hydrogen or water, carbon monoxide, anc a primary or secondary arine as reactants, is know. Various techniques have been described err bodying this principle and using catalysts of various kinds. US A 3 234 283 discloses a process or producing tertiary amines, in better yields and at lower pressures than previously used by treating CO, hydrogen and a secondary amine with a C10 C13 olefinic mixture in the presence of a cobalt carbonyl trialkylphosphine catalyst.Olefin conversion was 88 and there was 48E yield of n C11 C14 alkyldimethylamine in a resulting solid fraction from the catalyst. US A 3 513 200 covers the utilization of Group VIII metal complexes bearing a biphyllic ligand, such as a phosphine, and these complexes may optionally contain a metal hydride complexed with carbon monoxide. Poly heterocyclo amines can be added as an adjuvant. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between 50 und 2000C and under a pressure ranging from 0.5 to 35 NPa. P significant proportion of aldehydes is obtained, and the selectivity to amines in this process is still only very moderate. A paper by lobal in Helvetica Chimica Acta, Volume 54, pages 1440 to 1445 1971 , as troll as US A 3 947 458 describe the catalytic amnomethylation of olefins, employing a rhodium oxide catalyst, an iron carbonyl catalyst, and a mixed rhodium oxide iron carbonyl catalyst. Rhodium carbonyls form during the reaction. The overall reaction is as follows EMI2.1 The mixed rhodium iron carbonyl catalyst of Iqbal is said to be superior to the rhodium carbonyl catalyst alone, and to the iron carbonvl catalyst alone. This mixed rhodium carbonyl iron carbonyl catalyst is, however, believed byLaine US A 4 292 242 to be less selective.It also has other disadvantages, among which are the following the rhodium carbonyl iron carbonyl catalyst is not stable and is prone to decompose its use results in carboxy amide by products and it reduces some of the intermediate aldehyde to an alcohol. Also, in the case of an olefin having a terminal vinyl group CH CH2 , a considerahle proportion of the amino product has a branched chain,EMI2.2 rather than a straight chain, CH2 CH2 CH2NThe straight chain products are more important commercially. US A 4 096 150 discloses a process for the manufacture of tertiary amines wherein an olefin, hydrogen, CQ, and a secondary amine, are reacted in the presence of a coordination complex catalyst of a Group VIII metal and a ligand, whose donor atom is oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur. In J. Orq. Chem. 45 3370 1980 , Laine et al. describe the results of their studies on the aminomethylation reaction using a variety of Group VIII transition mtal carbonyl catalyst precursors. US A 4 292 242 states that the object of its invention is to provide improved methods of aminomethylation which are more selective and lead to fewer unwanted byproducts, such as alcohols and carboxy amides. A further object was to provide a more stable mixed carbonyl catalyst, the use of which would result in higher yields of the desired amines. Here, the claimed catalyst is a rixec ruthenium carbonyl iron carbonyl in a suitable solvent.Again, this process leads to a formamide by product. In J. Org. Chem., 47, 445 1982 , Jachimowicz et al.discuss various attempts to devise a one step, efficient and general conversion of olefins to amines. Among the catalysts used by various workers have been iron pentacarbonyl, rhodium oxide, ruthenium iron carbonyl and iridium catalysts. The article discusses the feasibility of various aminomethylation syntheses. In prior art aminomethylation processes, the reaction must often take place at high temperatures and or pressures, the olefin conversion and selectivity to the desired tertiary amines are not as high as desired, unwanted by products such as formamides are often formed, and a high degree of desired linearity is not achieved.Additionally, separation of the desired product from byproducts is often difficult, expensive and time consumina separation by distillation can be relatively difficult because of the high boiling point of the products. one of these processes attempts in particular to produce secondary and tertiary aralkylamines which can be used to provide surfactant tvpe amines. Another concept not approached in the references discussed, is a means to control distribution of the products, including whether branched or linear. Of course better selectivity is always a desired goal. Finally, none of the processes discussed provides an efficient means for separatinq the catalyst from the product. It would be a considerable advance in the art to devise a system for producing aralkylamines, usable as surfactant amines, from vinyl olefins such as substituted or unsubstituted styrene, synthesis gas i.e. carbon monoxide and hydrogen and primary and secondary amines by an aminomethylation process wherein the selectivity of production of branched and linear amine could be controlled, the distribution of various amines in the product mixture could be controlled by choice of solvent, and the conversion and selectivity figures would indicate an improvement over prior processes.In addition, it would be an advance over prior art to devise a process which proceeds under milder reaction conditions, forms fewer unwanted byproducts, such as formamides, and affords easy and efficient separation of the desired product from byproducts and catalyst. These and other desirable results are achieved by the process of this invention wherein secondary and tertiary aralkylamines are prepared by an aminomethylation process which comprises reacting an aromatic vinylic olefin e.g. styrene or a substituted styrene , a nitrogencontaining compound e.g. a primary or secondary amine , and synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen or, in a modified embodiment CO and H20 , in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a rutheniumcontaining compound, optionally mixed with a quaternary phosphonium salt, and in the presence of an amide solvent, and heating the resulting mixture at a temperature of at least 1000C and a pressure of at least 1.45 MPa until there is substantial formation of the desired secondary or tertiary aralkylamine. In the presence of certain added solvent media, the desired secondary or tertiary amine product can be separa ted from the ruthenium catalyst by a useful phase separation technique. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, sc cC n ary and tertiary aralkylamines are prepared via the mino methylation of styrene with primary and secondary amines.The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium catalyst and may he carried out in amide solvents. In this preferred invention to prepare secondary and tertiary aralkylamines from styrene, synthesis gas CO H2 and primary or secondary amines, the syntheses may be represented by the following general equation 2 .EMI5.1 wherein R and R are hydrocarbyl groups containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or alternatively, either R or R but not both may be hydrogen. Here, the improvements over the prior art provided by the present invention include a Improved selectivity to linear product A . b Improved control over the product mixture, whether it be preferably linear A or branched B . c Suppression of competing side reactions, such as reduction of the substrate styrene to ethyl benzene. d Ease of separation of the ruthenium catalyst from the desired secondary and tertiary amine products A. and B. It is a surprising feature of this invention, for example, that the selectivity to linear amine A can be relatively high. In previous, related reactions of styrene, catalyzed by transition metal complexes such as hydroformylation , selectivity to the desired product is often decreased as a result of undesired hydrogenation of the styrene to ethylbenzene. Additionally, styrene reactions involving addition to the olefinic double bond frequently lead predominantly to branched chain products B by Markovnikov addition. In the present invention, the anti Markovnikov amine. product A can be obtained in high yields. If, on the other hand, it is desired in this invention to generate primarily the branched chain amine product B , then the addition of a phosphonium salt, such as tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, to the ruthenium catalyst, ensures a higher proportion of branched chain amine in the crude liquid product. The composition of the amide solvent used in the present invention may also influence the selectivity between the linear and branched amine products,A and B. Suppression of competing side reactions, such as hydrogenation of styrene to unwanted ethylbenzene, is achieved by choice of ruthenium catalyst solvent. In the case of aminomethylation of styrene with primary amine coreactants, yield of secondary amine product may in some cases be lowered by competing carbonylation of the amine to formamide. The use of an amide solvent allows more efficient separation of secondary or tertiary amine product from the ruthenium catalyst. XvMen certain amide solvents, such as hydroxyethylpyrrolidone, are used, aminomethylation produces two phase mixtures that allow easy separation of most of the catalyst components from the desired amine products. In order to present the inventive concept in the greatest possible detail and to promote its understanding, the following supplementary disclosure is submitted.A. CATALYST COMPOSITION The catalyst components suitable in the practice of this invention essentially include a ruthenium containing compound, optionally in the presence of an aliphatic or aromatic amide solvent. and a quaternary phosphonium salt.The actual catalytically active species is unknown, bt is believed to comprise ruthenium in complex combination with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In the practice of this invention the ruthenium containing catalyst may be chosen from a wide variety of organic and inorganic comnounds, complexes, etc., as will be shown and illustrated below. It is only necessary that the catalyst precursor actually employed should contain ruthenium in any of its ionic states. The ruthenium catalyst precursors may take many different forms. For instance, the ruthenium may be added to the reaction mixture as an oxide, as in the case of for example, ruthenium IV oxide hydrate, anhydrous r t u r. IV dioxide and ruthenium VIII tetraoxide. Alternatively, it may be added 25 the salt of a mineral acid, e.g.ruthenium III chloride hydrate, ruthenium III bromide, ruthenium III iodize, tricarbonyl ruthenium II iodide, anhvdrous ruthenium III chloride and ruthenium nitrate, or as the salt of a suitable organic carboxylic acid, for example, ruthenium III acetate, ruthenium naphthenate or ruthenium valerate, or as a ruthenium complex with a carbonyl containing ligand, such as ruthenium III acetylacetonate. The ruthenium may also be added to the reaction zone as a ruthenium carbonyl or hydridocarbonyl derivative. Here, suitable examples include triruthenium dodecacarbonyl and other hydridocarbonyls such asH2Ru4 C0 13 and H4Ru4 CO 12, and substituted carbonyl species such as the tricarbonylruthenium II chloride dimer, Ru CO 3Cl2 2. Preferred ruthenium containing compounds include oxides of ruthenium, and ruthenium carbonyl or hydridocarbonyl derivatives. Among these, particularly preferred are ruthenium IV dioxide hydrate, anhydrous ruthenium IV oxide and triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Especially good results were obseryed with tr1 ruthenium dodecacarbonyl or ruthenium oxide. The optional quaternary onium salt to be used in the catalyst composition ray be any oniur salt but is pref erably one containing phosphorus, such as salts of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein Y is phosphorus, Ri, R2, R3 and R4 are organic groups, which may be the same or different, preferably alkyl, aryl or alkaryl, and X is an anion, The organic groups useful in this instance include those alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms in a branched or linear alkyl chan, such as methyl, ethyl, n butyl, isobutyl, octyl, 2 ethylhexyl and dodecyl.Tetraethylphosphonium bromide and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide are typical examples at present in commercial rroduction The corresponding quaternary phosphonium acetates, nitrates, chrorates, tetrafluoroborates, and other halides, such as the corresponding chlorides and iodid.es, are also satisfactory.B. FEEDSTOCK Tile feedstock used in the practice of this invention comprises a vinylic olefin, such as styrene or a substìt uted styrene, a primary or secondary amine, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The process can be applied to any aromatic vinylic olefin. Suitable aromatic vinylic olefin substrates having 8 to 25 carbon atoms include styrene, 2,5 dimethylstyrene, 2,4 dimethylstyrene, 2 methylstyrene, 3 methylstyrene, 4methylstyrene, vinyl naphthalene, alpha methylstyrene, divinylbenzene, 2 vinylpyridine, 4 vinylpyridine, 2 methyl5 vinylpyridine, and 2 vinylimidazole. Particularly preferred in the practice of this invention is the use of styrene, alpha methylstyrene, pmethylstyrene or divinylbenzene. Suitable nitrogen containing coreactants useful in the practice of this invention include primary and sccond ary amines having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. These amines may be straight or branched chain aliphatic series they ray be cycloaliphatic amines, or they may be aromatic airnes. Examples of suitable primary aliphatic and aromatic amine include methylamine, ethylamine, n propylamine, n hexylamine, n dodecylamine and aniline. Suitable cycloaliphatic amines include cyclohexylamine. Secondary aliphatic amines that are satisfactory coreactants include dimethylamine, diethylamine, methylethylamine, di n propyl amine, di isopropyl amine, di ethylhexyl amine, piperidine, morpholine, di n heptyl amine, and di n decyl amine, as well as 2aminooctane, N methylaniline, pyrrolidine and 2 hydroxyethyl pyrrolidone. Aliphatic diamines such as piperazine are also useful in the Dractice of this invention. zonia is a less effective coreactant. The quantity of nitrogen containing coreactant employed in the present invention is rot critical, and ray vary over a wide range. In general, however, it is cesirable to conduct the reaction in the presence of sufficient primarv or secondary amine to satisfy the stoichiometry of equation 1 .C. SYNTHESIS GAS The relative amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen which can be initially present in the synthesis gas mixture are variable over a wide range. In general, the mol ratio of CO H2 is preferably in the range from 20 1 to 1 20, and more preferably from 5 1 to 1 5, although ratios outside these ranges may also be emploved with good results.Particularly in continuous operations, but also in batch operations, the carbon monoxide hydrooen gaseous mixtures may also be used in conjunction with up to 50E by volume of one or more other gases. These other gases may include one or more inert gases such as nitrogen, argon or neon, or they may include gases that may or may not undergo reaction under carbon monoxide hydrogenation conditions, such as carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane or propane. Aminomethylation of aromatic, vinylic olefins may also be practiced using carbon monoxide alone as the gas, when in conjunction with controlled quantities of water.This modification of the invention is illustrated inExample 13.D. SOLVENT The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable amide solvent, e.g. an aliphatic amide or aromatic amide . If such solvents were to be omitted, and with styrene as substrate, ethylbenzene formation is a major side reaction, separation of the amine product from the ruthenium catalyst is difficult, and there is less control over the distribution of linear to branched secondary and tertiary amine products, A and B in equation 2 .These solvents should be liquids under the conditions of the aminomethylation reactions of equation 2, and should substantially solubilize the ruthenium compound catalyst components. The important advantages of the preferred solvent are enhanced yields of desired amine, improved am.ine ro duct linearity, and ease of separation of the desired secondary and tertiary amine product from the ruthenium catalyst through the formation of two phase liquid products. The Examples will demonstrate that the use of solvent leads to improvements in both the yield and desired linearity or branched structure of the desired amine. Suitable amide solvents may be N,N di.methylformam ide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N hydroxyethylpyrrolidone, methylpyrrolidone, N isopropylpyrrolidone, N ,N diethyl formamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N dimethylbenzamide, N ,N diphenylformamide, N,N dimethlbutyramide and Nbenzylpyrrolidone. A preferred clasps of solvents for aminomethylation of styrene includes N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, and N substituted pyrrolidones such as N isopropylpyrrolidone and N hydroxyethylpyrrol idone. The best solvent for obtaining linear amincs appears to be Nhydroxyethylpyrrolidone HEP . Some of the particular advantages noted when adding t hydroxyethtlpyrrolidone ISE solvent to the reaction mixture include 1. The conversion and selectivity to linear tert iary amines are both higher with HEP as solvent than in its absence as will be demonstrated by Examples 5, 12 and 16 in comparison to other examples. 2. The liquid product cleanly separates into two phases, the upper layer of which is rich in amine product in the lower layer HEP predominates, but unreacted primary or secondary amine and soluble ruthenium catalyst are also present. These layers are easily separated. The lower layer, rich in catalyst, may be recycled. The amount of solvent emploed may be varied as desired. In general, it is desirable to use sufficient solvent to fluidize the catalyst system.E. CONCENTRATION The quantity of ruthenium compound, quaternary phosphonium salt and amide solvent employed in the present invention is not critical, and may vary over a wide range.In general, the novel process is cesirably conducted in the presence of a catalytically effective quantity of active ruthenium species, in quaternary onium salt, and. optional a solvent which gives the desired product in reasonably yield. The reaction proceeds when employing as little as 1 x 10 9 weight and even lesser amounts, of ruthenium. The upper concentration is dictated by a variety of factors including catalyst cost, partial pressure of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, operating temperature, etc.A ruthenium concentration of from 0.0001 to 1 weight t in conjunction with a quaternary onium concentration of from 0.001 to 10 weight , and a solvent concentration of from 10 to 70 weight 8, based on the total weight of the reaction mixture is desirable in the practice of this invention. F. TEMPERATURE The temperature range which can usefully be employed in the process of the invention vn. ay vary over a consider able range depending upon experimental factors, including choice of catalyst, pressure and other variables. The process can take place at from 100 to 300 C or more. The preferred temperatures are 120 C and more preferably from 120 to 220 C. Coming under special consideration are temperatures from 150 to 190 C.G. PRESSURE Superatmospheric pressures of 0.8 MPa or greater leac to substantial yields of the desired amines. A pre ferred range is from 1.45 to 41.5 MPa although pressures above 41.5 MPa also provide useful yields of the desired products. A preferred range is from 3.5 to 14.0 NPa. The pressures referred to herein represent the total pressure cenerated by all the reactants, although they are substantially due to the carbon monoxide and hydrogen reactants.H. BY PRODUCTS The desired products of the reaction, the secondary and tertiary aralkyl amines are formed in significant quantities varying from 30 to 90E yields. Also formed will be minor by products, such as ethyl benzene, and formamides. The desired secondary and tertiary aralkyl amine products can be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means, such as fractional distillation in vacuo, etc., but distillation could be relatively difficult in some instances because of the high boiling points of the products. Further, in the process of this invention it has been discovered that an amide solvent, such as N hydroxy ethylpyrrolidone can be added to the reaction mixture to increase selectivity to the desired linear products. This process allows for a useful phase separation technique, which works well in separating the product amines from the ruthenium onium solvent catalyst. The crude reaction product mixture consists of to layers and the product amine is isolated from the upper, catalyst free layer.I. INTI OIDl lCTION OF CATALYST The process of the invention can be conducted in a batch ise, semi continuous or continuous manner. The catalyst can he initially introduced into the reaction zone batchwise, or it may be continuously or intermittently introduced into such a zone during the course of the synthesis reaction. Operating conditions can be adjusted to optimize the formation of the desired linear secondary or tertiary amines, and said material can be recovered by methods known to the art, such as distillation, fractionation and extraction. A fraction rich in the catalyst components may then be recycled to the reaction zone, if desired, and additional amine product generated.J. IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES The products have been identified in this work by one or more of the following analytical procedures viz, gas liquie. cnromatographv glc , infrared ir , mass spectometry, nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and elemental analyses, or a combination of these techniques. All temperatures are in degrees centigrade and all pressures in Megapascals MPa . Yields of secondary and tertiary alkyl amine products have been estimated on the basis of the quantity of aromatic vinyl olefin converted, and expressed as a percentile. The figures are estimated from gas liquid chromatography data. The linearity of the amine products has been estimated by measuring the quantity of linear amine formed A in accordance with equation 1, divided by the total secon dary or tertiary amine formed. Linearity is also expressed as a percentage. To illustrate the process of the invention, the following examples are given. It is to be understood, how ever, that the examples are given in the way of illustration are are not to be regarded as limiting the invention in any way.
