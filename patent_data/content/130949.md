# CONCRETE PANELS AND RELATIVE MEANS FOR THEIR ANCHORING TO EARTH, FOR FORMING A FACING WALL OF VARIABLE PLANIMETRIC COURSE AND ALLOWING SETTLEMENT OF THE PANELS IN THE FACING WALL SURFACE, AND THE FACING WALL THUS OBTAINED

## Abstract
The panels are constituted by two T shaped integrally formed flat elements 2, 3 , superposed in mutually trans lated relationship along one of the diagonal geometrical axes X X of the ideal quadrangular perimeter which cir cumscribes them, in such a manner as to form perimetral support zones 4, 4 , 5, 5 for other panels. The upper part of each element comprises, in proximity to the upper and lower side ends, oblong seats 6 for housing pins for connecting the panels 1 together. By suitably increasing the height of the stem of the T relative to the height of its transverse bar, a facing wall is obtained which can assume a variable planimetric course, while at the same time providing considerable facility for the settling of the panels in the surface of the facing wall itself. The earth anchoring means comprise anchoring ele ments 10 constituted by pluralities of threads of glass fila ments which form a warp 14 on which there is woven and resin bonded a weft 15 of glass and or polyester filaments, and connection elements on the panels for their fixing to the anchoring elements 10 .
