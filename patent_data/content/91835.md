# Electrical junction system.

## Abstract
An electrical junction system for automotive internal wiring has a wiring board 1, 101 provided with branching conductors formed by a multiplicity of bus bars 3, 103 on an insulation plate 1 , the branching conductors being adapted to be connected to electric wires 18 in a wiring harness to form branching electric circuits. The electrical junction system has a printed circuit board 5, 105 detachably mounted on the wiring board, the printed circuit board generally or inclusively carrying a plurality of circuits incorporating a multiplicity of function parts 22 which are used semi permanentally such as relays and associated control elements.
