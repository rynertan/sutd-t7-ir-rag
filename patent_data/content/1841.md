# Tylosin derivatives.

## Abstract
A number of 4 acyl derivatives of tylosin and acetyltylosin which are prepared by first protectively acylating at the 2 hydroxyl group of tylosin or acetyltylosin, secondly at the 4 hydroxyl group thereof, thirdly at the 4 hydroxyl group thereof and finally deacylating the 2 and 4 acyl groups to produce new 4 acyl derivatives of tylosin or acetyltylosin which effect high blood level compared to those tylosin derivatives heretofore are disclosed.
