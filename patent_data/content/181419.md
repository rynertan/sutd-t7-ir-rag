# A vegetable and fruit slicing apparatus.

## Abstract
A vegetable and fruit slicing apparatus including a member for rotating an object to be sliced about the axis of the object, a cutter blade, a mechanism for moving the cutter blade. The moving mechanism moves the cutter blade along a path oblique to the rotational axis of the object, thereby enabling the object to be sliced in such a manner that only a conical or truncated conical core remains unsliced.
