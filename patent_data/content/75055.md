## Description
Title An improved safety harness restraining fixture The present invention relates to an improved safety harness restraining fixture. There are numerous jobs mainly in building works, on scaffolding and suchlike where there is a risk of building workers falling. For this reason it is necessary to use some safety device which tends to prevent such falling. Present day devices either fail to be efficient, or involve some complicated construction. The safety harness restraining fixture covered by this invention is simple in design and is applicable for use with all kinds of scaffolding, structures and suchlike, since it embodies a restrainer piece which is able to travel freely along a counterweighted rope or cable when there is no undue strain and accordingly no accident risk. Said restrainer piece is also connected to a rope or cable to hold the person, but with an intermediate shock absorber assembly arranged so that in the event of operating, there is a sharp pull applied between the restrainer piece and the counterweighted rope, but not between this restrainer piece and the person who is held, and the safety harness becomes secured at a particular position on the counterweighted rope, and prevents the person from falling. The invention will now be described further by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a general diagrammatic view of a safety harness restraining fixture according to the invention, located on scaffolding 5 and provided with all its component parts, Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the restrainer piece 1 showing part of its basic features, and where a portion of rope or cable 3 is also shown , upon which the former slides freely or, when applicable, is locked stationary at a particular position when a sudden pulling force or jerk takes place, Figure 3 is a cross section view upon the lines A A inFigure 2, which shows the arrangement of its eye 11 wherein the shock absorbing assembly is located, and which in actual practice, is linked to the person to be held, and where the enlargement 130 can likewise be seen on the end of its lugs, in which there is a hole 131 having a varying width section, Figure 4 is a cross section view upon the linesB B in Figure 2 which shows also the hole 11 and the enlargement 120 on the other lug 12 in which there is a hole 121 having a varying width section and being placed the opposite way about from the aforementioned hole 131 , Figure 5 depicts an elevational view of one of the possible restraining arrangements that are included under the present invention.This figure includes a partial section to allow a more fully detailed view of hole 251 provided in plate 25 to enable its centre pin 20 to be capable of travelling by a degree in accordance with the amount of pull applied by. the person held by the end hole 201 , or by the dampening spring 22 which surrounds said pin and abuts against plate 25 and egainst the opposite end of pin 20 , Figure 6 is a general schematic view of the safety harness restraining fixture covered by the invention, where same is fitted onto scaffolding 5 , and where shock absorbing assembly 2 is located between same and rope 3 , and Figure 7 is an elevational view of another of the possible arrangements for the shock absorbing assembly as included in the present invention. The same notations are used in this figure to denote the component parts as in other figures, except that here they are distinguished with an apostrophe . In accordance with this invention and as shown in the construction of same as illustrated, the improved safety harness restraining fixture is basically made up from the following components A restrainer piece 1 , and A shock absorbing assembly 2 . Restrainer piece 1 is capable of travelling along or becoming engaged upon a rope or cable 3 which is counterweighted at one of its ends 4 , and secured at the other to the structure being built, the scaffolding or similar 5 , whilst in a different area, said restrainer piece 1 is linked in space to the shock absorbing assembly 2 , by means of which it secures the body of workman, likewise by means of rope or cable. See Figure 1. In accordance with another assembly arrangement of this invention as shown in Figure 6, restrainer piece i is capable of sliding along or becoming engaged upon a rope or cable 3 that is counterweighted at one of its ends 4 , and secured at the other to the shock absorbing assembly 2 , by means of which it is attached to the structure being built, the scaffolding or similar 5 .The restrainer piece 1 is linked, likewise by means of rope or cable, to the body or workman As may be seen by examining Figures 2, 3 and 4, the restrainer piece 1 possesses, in accordance with a practical construction thereof, a general asymmetrical U shape whose curved web is provided with a hole 11 , whilst its lugs 12 and 13 each have enlargements 120 and 130 respectively on their ends, and which enlargements are each provided with a hole 121 and 131 respecti very3 going through same, the width of which varies evenly and where one such hole 121 is located the other way about from the other 131 . The shock absorbing assembly 2 as illustrated in the practical construction depicted by Figure 5 is comprised of two pins, of which one is straight 20 , and the other is U shaped 21 , these being assembled upon a plate 25 in such a manner that pin 20 can travel and pin 21 is stationary. Such attachment is accomplished by means of two sets of nuts 24 , each screwed onto one of the threaded portions 211 of pin 21 securing same at either side of plate 25 . The straight pin 20 on the other hand, goes through a hole 251 located in the centre of the plate, and at one of its ends there is a lug provided with a hole 201 , while at the other there is a threaded length 202 , where in the former a cable or rope is placed to secure the person or workman, while upon the latter there is a nut 23 that holds a stop washer, between which stop washer and plate 25 , a dampener spring 22 is fitted. The freely swivelling linkage between the restrainer piece 1 and the shock absorbing assembly 2 is accomplished in this practical construction of the invention with a washer 6 placed in the hole 11 on the restrainer piece 1 and linked in turn to pin 21 in the shock absorbing assembly 2 . The shock absorbing assembly 2 illustrated in Figure 7 is comprised of two pins, of which one is straight 20 and the other shaped in the form of a U 21 , the tips of whose arms 25 are bent outwards in order to make a stop. Pin 21 is fitted with a washer 26 that has holes at its centre and across its diameter which accommodate pins 21 and 20 respectively, this latter being secured with a nut 23 that holds a stop washer 26 , between which stop washer and bent tips 25 , a dampening spring 22 is fitted. The freely swivelling linkage between the rope 3 and the shock absorbing assembly 2 is accomplished in this practical construction of the invention by means of threading said rope 3 through a hole 201 that is provided on the end of pin 20 . Said shock absorbing assembly 2 is then secured to the structure or scaffolding 5 by means of a ring 6 . When assembling the safety harness restraining fixture, the rope or cable 3 counterweighted at 4 and secured to the structure or scaffolding 5 , is threaded through holes 121 and 131 in their wide sections, so that free travel is afforded in the direction shown by the counterweighted rope 3 . When, however, there is an impending accident, a pulling force is exerted upon said restrainer piece 1 through the shock absorbing assembly 2 so as to prevent any possible injury to the individual due to jerking . Such abnormal pulling causes the restrainer piece 1 to travel in angular direction with respect to the rope or cable 3 , and to do so downwards this being the only possible direction, because of the force of gravity , whereupon said rope or cable 3 travels linearly within holes 121 and 131 towards the narrow sections, which grip it firmly to the extent of locking it securely.
