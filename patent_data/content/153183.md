# MICROTOME HAVING A HANDWHEEL FOR A DRIVING A SPECIMEN HOLDER

## Abstract
A microtome comprises a handwheel which can be ro fated in two directions of rotation, and drive means for the purpose of driving a specimen holder, so that the specimen holder executes a cutting movement when the handwheel is rotated in one direction, and a resetting movement when the handwheel is rotated in the other direction. The cutting and resetting movements take place relative to a cutting knife. A reduction gearing arrangement enables the speed of the cut ting movement to be reduced relative to the speed of the resetting movement without having to rotate the handwheel at a correspondingly lower rate. A catch enables the reduc tion gearing arrangement to be bridged so that the speed of the cutting movement and resetting movement are equal for any given rate of rotation of the handwheel.
