# Ultrasonic flowmeter.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic flowmeter for measuring a flow rate of a fluid flowing in a conduit 100 in accordance with a differ ence between propagation times of ultrasonic waves from a first ultrasonic transducer 101 to a second transducer 102 and from the second transducer 102 to the first 101 , the pair of ultrasonic transducers 101, 102 being disposed in the conduit 100 opposing each other such that a line con necting them 101, 102 is inclined to the flowing direction, characterized in that the ultrasonic flow meter includes driving means 204, 205 for simultaneously driving the pair of ultrasonic transducers 101, 102 time difference mea suring means 210, 211, 217 for measuring a primary time difference between the time when one ultrasonic transducer 101 receives an ultrasonic wave which is radiated from the other 102 and the time when the other transducer 102 receives an ultrasonic wave from the first transducer 101 , for measuring a secondary time difference between a time when one ultrasonic transducer 101 receives an ultrasonic wave which is radiated from itself and reflected by the other 102 and a time when the other ultrasonic transducer 102 receives an ultrasonic wave which is radiated from itself and reflected by the first transducer 101 , and for producing primary and secondary time difference data by respectively adding signs thereto in accordance with the arrival order of ultrasonic waves and calculating means 219,222,223,224 for subtracting the secondary time difference data from the primary time difference data to calculate an actual flow rate of the fluid.
