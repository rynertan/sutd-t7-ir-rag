# PLASMA PROCESSED SINTERABLE CERAMICS

## Abstract
Highly pure and dense sintered ceramics are produced by passing ceramic precursors through a radio frequency plasma torch 11 , and reacting these precursors to produce a powder which is subsequently sintered to desirable shape and size. The powder is very reactive, fine, pure, spherical, free of agglomera tion and has a narrow size distribution. These properties are ideal for producing highly dense, high strength ceramics, and at sub stantially lower temperatures than the melting or decomposition points of these materials. Ceramic bodies made in this way can be shaped into a wide variety of forms.
