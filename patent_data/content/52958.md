# MODIFIED POLYURETHANE LIQUID POLYMER COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
A novel heat curable liquid polymer composition com prises a modified urethane oligomer containing terminal ethylenic unsaturation and a free radical catalyst. It is prepared by heating a mixture of the oligomer and the catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composi tion further includes a reinforcing agent and or a filler the cured composition demonstrates enhanced impact prop erties and is particularly useful in automotive body construc tions. The urethane oligomer has an equivalent ratio of MCO to OH from 0.5 1 to 2 1 and has been prepared by reacting a an isocyanate terminated prepolymer having a final free MCO content ranging from 0.5 to 30 and that is the product of reacting an organic polyisocyanate with an isocyanate reactive group containing unsatu rated acrylate andior unsaturated amide monomer, with b a polyol having an average equivalent weight in the range 75 to 500 and an average functionality of at least about 3.
