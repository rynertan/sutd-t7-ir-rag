# Malt beverage foam enhancing process and faucet.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus in which a smooth, stable foam is formed by intimately admixing a nitrogen containing gas, preferably air, by a Venturi effect in a faucet positioned on the beer tap. The faucet can dispense flat malt beverage and a smooth, creamy and stable foam and has a shiftable faucet shaft, which, in one position dispenses flat beer, and in a second position provides an alternate flow path through restricted orifices which increase the velocity of the malt beverage so that it draws air into the faucet housing through orifices therein and incorporates the air into the foam to dispense a stable, creamy foam from the faucet discharge port. The apparatus comprises a housing 11 including a first chamber 14 and a second smaller chamber 17 , valve means 15 between these chambers and beverage velocity increasing means 27,28 .

## Description
The invention relates to the field of beer dispensing and apparatus therefore and in particular relates to a process for stabilizing foam from draft beer as it is dispensed. It further relates to a faucet for stabilizing foam draft beer as it is dispensed. In the art of making beer, it is very important that the appearance of the beer in the glass be at tractive to the user. While flavor is the aspect most talked about in beer, appearance is the first thing noticed by the customer and that makes it important. The shade and depth of color, the clarity, beading, type of head foam, the foam retention, and the foam cling, all contribute to making the initial impression. It is desirable that the foam atop a glass of beer dispensed from a tap be smooth, creamy, be relatively stable and have an attractive taste. The incorporation of air on nitrogen into beer as it is dispensed at the tap spout gives a head of very fine bubbles with excellent stability and a creamy, slightly sweet desirable taste. The type of malt beverage which heretofore has attracted the most attention in connection with a stable, creamy head is Irish stout. The dispensing of stout so as to achieve this desirable head has passed through num erous evolutionary stages. Originally the stout was krausened by the addition of fresh wort containing yeast, so that the stout developed about 30 to 35 psi 2.11 kg cm² to 2.46 kg cm² pressure in the cask and when dispensed, issued as a fine smooth cream. As the cask was used it tended to become flat, so that the stout then was blended and served as a mixture of flat stout with a creamy head from a new high conditioned cask. Later a device known as a Beamish Quick One Server was used, in which the conditioned stout was poured into a serving flask having a tap at the bottom, so that a glass was poured substantially full from the tap and then a creamy head poured from the top of the server. Later, a dispensing procedure known as B.D. or bottling draught was used. In this procedure, the pub owner utilized two casks of stout, one filled with a higher conditioned stout and one with a flat stout or B.D. stout. A charge was drawn from the conditioned cask and the remainder of the glass filled with B.D. stout. There is a Scottish procedure which utilized a top pressure of air on a cask, but this sometimes re sulted in differences in taste of the beverage from the cask due to oxidation effects. Guinness utilizes a keg having a head of pres surized nitrogen or air to produce the desired foam and then utilizes a degasing system to provide flat beer for topping of the glass after the foam has been poured. Beamish and Crawford has utilized a system of dispensing stout in which a low pressure keg having a special dispensing tap with a spherical ball mounted thereon is used. A portion of the stout is routed to the ball and pressurized with a mixture of nitrogen and C02, so that manipulation of the dispensing valve allows for production of foam from the spherical head and sub sequent filling with flat stout from the keg. Presently a procedure is used whereby the beer is saturated with nitrogen at the plant prior to kegging. Foam is produced by releasing the beer through a small orifice in the tap and the remainder of the glass is filled with flat beer by bypassing the orifice. This too is caused by manipulation of the dispensing valve in the tap. The foregoing described procedures are not totally satisfactory and, if nitrogen is used, an ad ditional expense is involved. Also, several of the pro cesses require the use of high pressure kegs, which, in turn, necessitates heavier duty installation in the pub. It also is the general practice and custom in the brewing industry to exclude all possible air from contact with beer because of the known oxidizing effect of air on beer. Oxygen, when in contact with beer for periods of time tends to cause off flavors, etc. Ac cordingly, the incorporation of air into beer is contrary to present practices, but when added immediately prior to the beer entering the glass, the known deleterious ef fects are avoided. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention involves the provision of a relatively inexpensive pro cedure for processing a foamed malt beverage which has stability in the foam. The present invention therefore provides a process for foaming malt beverages characterized by the steps of moving a pressurized malt beverage stream from a container through a passage, dividing the malt beverage stream into a plurality of smaller streams of higher linear velocity and discharging the smaller streams into a mixing chamber, injecting a nitrogen containing gas into the mixing chamber, intimately mixing the nitrogen containing gas into the malt beverage streams, and discharging the malt beverage mixed with nitrogen containing gas as a thick creamy stable foam. Another aspect of the invention involves an apparatus which can be utilized for dispensing both flat beer and foamed beer having a high degree of stability to the foam. Thus, the present invention also includes a faucet for dispensing malt beverages, including a faucet having a discharge port, means for connecting the faucet housing to a source of malt beverage, valve means in the faucet housing shiftable between shut off, full flow and restricted flow positions, and means associated with the valve means for incorporating a nitrogen containing gas into the malt beverage when the valve means is in its restricted flow position to produce a creamy, stable foam from the discharge port. In developing a preferred embodiment of the invention we have found that, using a Venturi effect, we are able to incorporate air or nitrogen in substantial amounts into the beer as it leaves the tap and prior to its entering the glass of the user. We have found that by dividing the stream of beer from the tap into a series of smaller streams of higher velocity, drawing air into the streams, and then creating turbulence in the stream so as to mix the air therein, we can create a beer foam comprised of bubbles of very small diameter which is ex tremely stable over a period of time. By combining this type nozzle with a conventional nozzle, we are able to draw a glass of beer having a head of a smooth, creamy foam which is stable and long lasting. Currently there are on the market so called push back foam causing faucets, which work on the prin ciple of restricting the beer at the valve seat, usually through one or two apertures on the shaft. These devices are believed to operate on the foaming caused by the pres sure drop across the shaft wall and do not incorporate additional air or nitrogen into the foam. These type devices, moreover, are not capable of producing a satisfactory type foam especially on the new light beers. The foam does not form a tight head and the foam falls off , i.e., it goes flat quickly. Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide a dispensing faucet which when in a first position will dispense flat beer and when in a second position will dispense a smooth, creamy and stable foam. More specifically, the invention provides a faucet for dispensing malt beverages including a housing having a first chamber connectable to a source of malt beverage, a second smaller chamber communicating with the first chamber, a shoulder defined in the first chamber at the area of its communication with the second chamber, a dispensing port communicating with the second chamber, a valve mechanism including a valve seat for sealing against the shoulder to close off communicating between the first and second chambers, a member carrying the seat and shiftable between full flow, shut off, and foam dispensing positions, the member being partly positioned in the first chamber and partly in the second chamber and slidable between and within each chamber, means associated with the shiftable member to define an alternate path between the first and second chambers for the malt beverage when the shiftable member is in foam dispensing positions, and means for introducing air into the malt beverage in the second chamber to create a thick, stable, creamy foam when the shiftable member is in its foam dis pensing position. This faucet is capable of creating a stable, thick foam even with the conventional light type beers presently being sold. This faucet also is capable of dis pensing flat beer so that the single faucet can dispense a glass of beer having a head of a smooth, creamy foam which is stable and long lasting. Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken together with the accompanying drawings wherein It is the general practice and custom in the brew ing industry to exclude all possible air from contact with beer because of the known oxidizing effect of air on beer. Oxygen, when in contact with beer for periods of time, tends to cause off flavors, etc. Accordingly, the incorporation of air into beeris contrary to present prac tices, but when added immediately prior to the beer entering the glass, the known deleterious effects are avoided. In developing the data for the curves designed as Fig. 1, we used a method of testing for foam which we origi nated and which gives accurate, reproducible and represen tative results.This method is hereinafter described Fig. 1 shows that N₂ or air which is 79 N₂ and performs the same function in foaming have the same original volume as beer foam formed from C0₂, but that the stability is substantially greater. Oxygen O₂ too has the same original volume as N₂ and air, but the stability is less. Helium He has less original volume than N₂ and its stability approximates that of oxygen for 30 minutes after which it drops off. Figs. 3 7 show a preferred device for incorporating gas into beer and forming the thick, creamy long lasting foam desired from this invention. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of conventional draft beer, with no gas injected and dispensed through a conven tional beer tap, and the same beer dispensed through our Venturi mixing nozzle with air or N₂ gas injected. While all of the beers are 100 foam when poured into the graduates, measurements were first noted at one 1 minute and the regular beer already had lost about 20 of its volume whereas the gas treated foam had lost only about 7 of its volume. The difference became more pronounced as time passed. The slope of the regular beer curve which measures the rate of foam decline was about 55 , whereas the slopes of the curves of the gas treaded foams was about 15 . There is substantially no difference between the foam created by injecting N₂ and the foam created by injecting air. Air is preferred because of cost and convenience, i.e., no shroud is needed as would be the case if N₂ is the gas. Fig. 3 shows the beer dispensing faucet 10 of this invention in its off position. The faucet 10 consists of a body 11, an actuator handle 12 and a faucet shaft 13. The body 11 includes an enlarged chamber 14 connected to a supply of pressurized malt beverage and terminating in an internal shoulder 15 which functions as a valve seal for the valve seat 16, which is made from an elastomeric material. Connected to the shoulder 15 is a reduced main passage 17 which includes a guide chamber 18 for a cylindrical end member 19 of the faucet shaft 13. A discharge port 20 intersects the main pas sage 17 at approximately a 60 angle and allows the malt beverage to flow from the faucet 10. The faucet shaft 13 functions as a valve means and comprises a stem 25 shown in Figs. 6 7 which includes the cylindrical guide member 19 which fits loosely in the guide chamber 18 and reciprocates back and forth therein and serves to align the shaft mechanism 13 in the body 11. A reduced shaft 26 connects the guide mem ber 19 to a valve seat retaining flange 27 which is an important feature of this invention. The flange 27 reciprocates freely in the main passage 17 and is provided with a series of homogenizing perforations or openings 28 around its periphery. The openings 28 are from 0.010 to 0.040 inches 0.25 mm to 1.0 mm in diameter. Connected to the rear face 29 of the flange 27 is a tubular member 30 which has an internal passage 31 terminating in the flange rear face 29. The tubular member 30 has a reduced circumferential area 32 adjacent to the flange rear face 29 which contains two ports 33 connecting the reduced area 32 to the internal passage 31. An enlarged spring retainer bearing area 34 connects to the reduced portion and terminates in a threaded portion 35. Referring back to Fig. 3, the faucet shaft 13 further includes the valve seat 16 which is mounted on a spring retainer 36. The spring retainer 36 is lon gitudinally slidably positioned on the valve stem bearing area 34 and has a circumferential flange 37 which sep arates a return spring 38 from the seat 16. An end cap 39 is threaded onto the faucet shaft threaded portion 35 and retains the spring 38 on the stem 25. The end cap 39 has a throughbore 40 which connects to the stem pas sage 31. The handle 12 is loosely positioned in an elongated opening 45 in the body 11. An end 12a of the handle 12 is loosely positioned in a slot 46 in the faucet shaft cylindrical guide member 19. Longitudinal movement of the handle 12 moves the stem 25 through the positions of Figs. 3, 4 5, i.e., from shut off Fig. 3 to flat beer dispensing Fig. 4 to foam dispensing Fig. 5 positions. The body 11 also includes one or more vents 47 to admit air along with the air which enters through the loose fit of the faucet shaft guide member 19 in the body chamber 18 to the body interior 17, 20 where it is mixed with beer when the faucet shaft 13 is in the po sition of Fig. 5. The faucet 10 is designed to dispense flat beer from the position of,Fig. 4 and to dispense a thick, creamy foam which is stable even when light type beers are being dispensed from the position of Fig. 5. Fig. 3 shows the tap in its shut off position. The handle 12 is in its vertical or neutral position with the valve seat 16 seated against the internal shoulder 15. This seals the main passage 17 from the en larged chamber 14 which is connected to beer supply. Accordingly, no beer can pass the valve seat 16 and enter the dispensing port 20. To dispense regular or flat beer, the handle 12 is pulled forward toward the left in Figs. 3, 4 5 to shift the faucet shaft 13 longitudinally toward the right to the position shown in Fig. 4. In this position, the valve seat 16 is moved away from the shoulder 15 to open a passageway 48 therebetween Fig. 4 . This allows beer to flow unimpedely from the beer source in the chamber 14, through the passage 48, along the main passage 17, and out the dispensing port 20. This flow is depicted by the arrow A in Fig. 4. When it is desired to dispense foam, the handle 12 is moved backward to the position of Fig. 5, which shifts the stem 25 longitudinally to the left. This en gages the valve seat 16 in sealing engagement with the shoulder 15. The end cap 39 compresses the return spring 38 against the spring retainer 36. The tubular member 30 moves longitudinally leftward to open a cylin drical chamber to the flow of beer through the internal 31 and the ports 33. The ports 33 have a size of from about 0.02 to about 0.06 inches .50 mm to about 1.5 mm in diameter. The beer in this chamber designated by the numeral 50 in Fig. 5 has less pressure than the 12 15 p.s.i. .85 kg cm² 1.06 kg cm² of the beer in the storage receptacle because of the pressure drop across the ports 33. The beer in the chamber 50 is forced through the orifices 28 in the valve seat retaining flange 27 at increased velocity as the openings 28 are smaller in diameter than the ports 33. From the openings 28, the beer moves into the main passage 17 where it draws air through the vents 47 by a Venturi type effect. Air also enters the main passage 17 beside the loose fit of the faucet shaft guide 19 in the body chamber 18. When the beer is forced around the turn from the main pas sage 17 into the dispensing port 20, it is intimately mixed with the air and the foam is formed into small stable bubbles which deposit a smooth, creamy, stable head on a glass of flat beer. The beer flow is indicated diagrammatically by the arrows B in Fig. 5. To stop the formation of foam, the valve mechanism is returned to the positions of Figs. 3 or 4.
