## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO INCANDESCENT LAMPS The present invention relates to the support of elongated filaments in incandescent lamps, and more especially in linear, halogen regenerative cycle lamps. Elongated incandescent filaments operating above 100V require support along their length. In linear tungsten halogen lamps it has been the practice to support a coiled filament at intervals along the length of the lamp by spaced spirals of refractory metal, usually tungsten. These spirals fit loosely in the lamp tube and terminate in a coil which is secured to or otherwise meshes with the filament coil over two or three turns. The ends of the lamp envelope are sealed in conventional manner with pinch seals having molybdenum foil strips by which the electrical supply passes through the seals. These are welded to leadwires which are themselves screwed onto the ends of the coiled filament. In an improved lamp shown in Figure 1 the elongated coiled filament 1 is supported at intervals by support wires 2 substantially rigidly mounted in the lamp envelope 3 independently of the filament. In the preferred embodiment each. wire terminates in a coil 4 of two or more turns having a pitch and diameter such that the coil supports the filament without meshing therewith. Such a supporting coil arrangement is disclosed and claimed in our European Patent ApplicationNo.80 301645 publication No.0020075 . The rigid mounting of the support wires is preferably achieved by securing the wires to a rigid insulating rod, shown at 5 in Figure 1, extending alongside or generally parallel to the filament 1. This rod may be made from high silica content glass for example that identified by the Registered Trade Mark VYCOR , high melting point aluminosilicate or borosilicate glass or possibly an insulating ceramic but quartz is preferred for a tungsten halogen lamp. The supports 2 are preferably introduced into the insulating rod 5 by the method of heating the quartz or glass and pushing in the wire supports, disclosed and claimed in our European Patent Application No.81 300412 but the method described and claimed in British Patent ApplicationNo.2064215A may also be used. As mentioned the ends of the lamp are sealed by pinch seals 6, incorporating molybdenum foils 7, generally with ceramic caps 8. The rod 5 is supported by further supports 9 attached to the rod in the same manner as supports 2 and welded to foils 7. The ends of the filament 1 are supported by solid plugs 10, also welded to foils 7 and onto the end of which the filament 1 is held by interference fit at 11 . This form of construction is not entirely satisfactory for some of the lower wattage linear tungsten halogen lamps as for these the filament may be so fine that it is impractical to weld or hot press it to connect it to the plug. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved filament to foil connection for lower wattage lamps and an improved filament assembly and lamp incorporating that connection. According to the invention there is provided a linear filament assembly for an incandescent lamp, the assembly including a generally linear coiled or coiled coil filament having a central coil portion and two tail coil portions each separated from the central portion by a respective gap in the coil or secondary coil, a rigid refractory insulating rod extending generally parallel to the filament, a plurality of supports extending between the rod and the filament at spaced positions to support the central portion of the filament coil relative to the rod and two support members, each secured to the rod at respective ends thereof, each support member including a part extending along the axis of the filament coil and engaging the respective tail coil portion through the bore thereof to support the ends of and tension the filament coil. If the coil portion is a single coil then the gaps are sections of uncoiled filament wire. If the coil portion is a coiled coil then the gaps are single coil sections. The invention embraces a linear filament incandescent lamp using such a filament assembly and is particularly applicable to halogen regenerative cycle lamps. In order that the invention may be clearly understood and readily carried into effect it will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 shows a prior art linear filament lamp of which the significance has been discussed hereinbefore Figure 2 shows a detail of a prior artfilament support illustrating two different forms Figure 3 shows a filament assembly in accordance with this invention, and Figure 4 shows an alternative form of the assembly ofFigure 3. There is shown in Figure 2 a filament 1 for a linear incandescent lamp supported by a quartz backbone rod 5 by supports 2 and electrically connected to foils 7 in the prior art manner. The left hand end of the filament 1 as illustrated is in fact supported and connected to the foil 7 in essentially the manner shown in Figure 1 except that end support 9 is introduced axially into rod 5 in an acceptable alternative form. The right hand end has plug 10 replaced by a wire 12, which like the support wires 2 and 9 may be of material such as tungsten, molybdenum or tantalum. This wire is formed with a coil part 13 which is screwed into and enmeshed with the coil of the filament 1 and subsequently welded or hot pressed to foil 7. It will be apparent that these two constructions will be difficult to achieve satisfactorily with very fine filament wires. Furthermore the lit length, 0 , of the filament, is defined by the extent to which the plug 10 or coil 13 are screwed into the filament and it is difficult accurately and reproducibly to define this length. To improve this construction it is proposed to use a construction of which one form is shown in Figure 3. In this construction the filament 1, is a conventional single coil or coiled coil filament supported in the manner of the said twoEuropean patent applications on a quartz backbone rod 5. At each extreme of length 2 the filament coil is, however, formed with discontinuity which may be called a a gap or lazy turn 14. This ensures that the desired lit length is t and as such is defined with the accuracy to which the position of the lazy turn can be determined. It should be clear that the filament wire or the primary coil of a coiled coil is continuous and the gap is in the coil or secondary coil . Outward of the lazy turns 14 the coiled coil or single coil construction resumes with filament tail coils 15. The quartz rod 5 is supported at its ends by end supports 16, in this example introduced axially into the rod. These supports are cranked to provide a part 17 which in each case is on the axis of the filament support loops 4 and therefore with the filament. The filament tail coils 15 outside lazy turns ware then disposed around and co axial with parts 17 and the two are welded to foils 7. In this manner the filament and rod 5 are supported by supports 16 and the join to the foil 7 is by a single weld at each end which is advantageous. The tails 15 do not light because of the substantial conductive core provided by part 17 of support 16 so that the lit length is solely the well defined length 9 t. In construction the filament 1 is first threaded through the support loops 4 and one filament tail 15 is located on the part 17 of one support 16 through the gap of lazy turn 14 so that the support engages through the bore of the tail. The filament is then tensioned appropriately to engage the other support 16 with the other tail 15 in the same manner and the sub assembly welded to the molybdenum sealing foils 7. It will be apparent that the form of construction thus provides a rigidly mounted filament sub assembly prior to welding to the foils which firmly holds the thin low wattage filament for medium and high voltage lamps 100 250 volts . The constructiòn also allows the filament in such an assembly to be pre set to the required tension to prevent filament sag throughout lamp life as determined by the crank length. Figure 4 shows essentially the same form of construction as that of Figure 3 except that the supports 16 are simple L shaped members which are introduced into the side of the backbone rod 5 in the same manner as the support 2. The constructions shown in Figures 3 and 4 do not illustrate the lamp envelopes or seals but it will be appreciated that these will typically be as shown in Figure 1. In a typical practical lamp the filament is of 0.0427mm diameter wire coiled on itself to form a primary coil of 0.177mm diameter and coiled on itself again to form a coiled coil of which the secondary coil is of 0.742mm diameter. It will be appreciated that the use of this invention is not limited to the low wattage lamps for which it is particularly advantageous. It may be used with other linear filament incandescent lamps of both double and single ended construction and may use materials and constructions of other parts which are known for or which may transpire to be suitable for such lamps.
