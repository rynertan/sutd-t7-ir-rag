# Self aligning guillotine.

## Abstract
A guillotine assembly 18 is provided wherein a blade 34 is insertable between two halves of an anvil 46,48 to cut a paper web 14 . The blade 34 is provided with teeth 54 which engage triangular grooves 56 in a resilient member 46 of the anvil which is pressed against a rigid anvil plate 48 . Points 68 on the teeth 54 first penetrate the web 14 , tooth mid sections 70 thereafter form a series of slits in the web 14 , and thereafter points of contiguity 74 between the teeth 54 jam the slits to sever the web 14 . The teeth 54 each enter one of the grooves 56 for the points of contiguity 74 to engage and displace the resilient member 46 in the final stage of cutting.
