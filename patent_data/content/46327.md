# Printed matter having elements to indicate counterfeiting, and method for manufacturing such printed matter.

## Abstract
Printed matter comprising a plurality of elements applied in printing and causing in a half tone reproduc tion a moir√© pattern each element being made up of alternatingly print zones and blank zones being delimited by portions of curved lines, said curved lines being comprised in a set of curved lines which set is a topo logical equivalent of a set of concentric circles 61, 51, 41, 31, 21, 11, 1 wherein the sum of the areas of the print zones equals the sum of the areas of the blank zones. A super element accordingly comprises two or more elements, each element forming a track, the zones in the respective elements or tracks 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 being different as to their width, each element thus representing a different spatial frequency as shown in the figure 2. A method for manufacturing printed mat ter is characterized in that the print area in an element or super element equals the non print blank area therein.
