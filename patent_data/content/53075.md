## Description
NONVOLATILE MEMORY The present invention relates to a nonvolatile memory, and more particularly relates to a nonvolatile semiconductorEE PROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read OnlyMemory . A programmable ROM is widely utilized in, for example, a computer aided data processing system. Usually, a ROM can be programmed only once, either at the factory or in the field, by electrically fusing or otherwise removing unwanted internal links. Accordingly, the conventional programmableROM has a defect in that a mistake in the programming cannot be corrected. For the purpose of overcoming the above mentioned defect, an EPROM Erasable Programnabe ROM has been proposed and widely utilized in many nations. In theEPROM, the stored data can be erased by ultraviolet light and each bit can be electrically reprogrammed with appropriate voltage pulses. However, in the conventionalEPROM, since ultraviolet light is required for reprogramming the stored data, it is not easy for an operator to freely reprogram the stored data. In recent years, a nonvolatile EE PROM has been proposed, for example, in the publication 1Electronics ,February 28, 1980 pages 113 through 117, entitled 16 KEE PROM relies on tunneling for byte erasable program storage . The EE PROM is basically comprised of a transistor ha ving a source, a drain, a floating gate and a control gate, in which the floating gate partially includes an area of a very thin insulation layer on the order of a hundred . Thus, a tunnel effect can be created, via the thin insulation, between the drain and the floating gate, and thereby data, to be stored in each memory cell, is reprogrammed. The EE PROM is very useful for an operator in, for example, the computer aided data processing system, because, as previously mentioned, he can freely reprogram the stored data without using ultraviolet light. However, such an EE PROM circuit of the prior art has the following two defects. Firstly, undesired erasure of data often occurs in some of the half selected memory cells, which will be explained in detail hereinafter. Secondly, it is not relativelyxeasy during mass production to produce theEE PROM circuit devices. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention, to provide a nonvolatile memory which can overcome the above mentioned two defects. The present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 illustrates a cross sectional view showing a known EE PROM of a prior art Fig. 2 depicts a circuit diagram of a conventional memory cell including the transistor of Fig. 1 therein Fig. 3 depicts a circuit diagram of a conventional memory comprised of memory cells MC shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4A depicts an equivalent circuit diagram of each memory cell MC according to the present invention Fig. 4B depicts an equivalent circuit diagram of each memory cell MC of the prior art Fig. 5 illustrates a plan view of a memory cell having the circuit diagram of Fig. 4A, according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 6 6 Fig. 7 s a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 7 7 Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 8 8 Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 9 9 Fig. 10 illustrates a memory circuit diagram comprised of many memory cells according to the present invention shown in Figs. 5 through 9 Fig. 11 illustrates a plan view showing another embodiment of the memory cell according to the present invention and, Fig. 12 illustrates a memory circuit diagram comprised of many memory cells of another embodiment according to the present invention. Fig. 1 illustrates a cross sectional view showing a known EE PROM of a prior art. In Fig. 1, a basic transistor, especially, an FET Field Effect Transistor of the EE PROM is formed in and on a semiconductor substrate SUB. A source S and a drain D of the transistor is formed therein.On the substrate SUB, a floating gate FG and a control gate CG are formed via an insulation layer SiO2 IS. The floating gate FG partially faces the substrate, especially the drain D, via a very thin insulation layer IS . The floating gate FG, cooperating with the thin insulation layer IS , is necessary to construct the electrically erasable EE memory. When a positive high voltage is applied to the control gate CG, the voltage level of the floating gate FG is also increased by the positive high voltage, due to the presence of a capacitor formed between the gate CG and the gate FG having a relatively thick insulation layer IS .At this time, if the voltage level, to be applied to the drain D, is set at 0 V, an extremely high electric field is created, across the thin insulation layer IS , between the gate FG and the drain D. Then electron charges are injected from the drain D into the floating gate FG, which phenomena provide a tunnel effect.Thereby an erase operation is completed. Contrary to the above, in a write operation, the voltage level of the control gate CG is set at 0 V and the voltage level of the drain D is set at a positive high voltage, and thus the electron charges are injected from the floating gate FG into the drain D. Fig. 2 depicts a circuit diagram of a conventional memory cell including the transistor of Fig. 1 therein. The memory cell MC of Fig. 2 is fabricated as a two transistor cell type memory cell. The memory cell MC is comprised of a programming transistor Q1 and a selecting transistor Q2 which corresponds to the transistor of Fig. 1. The symbols D, S, FG and CG denote respectively the aforesaid drain, source, floating gate and control gate. The selecting transistor Q2 is used fo accessing the transistor Q1 when this memory cell MC is specified by an address signal. The programming transistor Q1 functions to store, read and write data alternately. These transistors and Q2 are connected in series with each other along a column line Y, namely a bit line, and to a ground GND.The gate G of the transistor Q2 is connected to a row line X, namely a word line. The control gate CG of the transistor Q1 is connected to a program line PR which is arranged in parallel with the row line X. Fig. 3 depicts a circuit diagram of a conventional memory comprised of memory cells MC shown in Fig. 2. InFig. 3, the members having identical reference symbols are substantially the same as those of Fig. 2. In the memory, a write operation is achieved as follows. If the memory cell MCa is accessed, the positive high voltage, such as 18 V, is applied to the column line Ya and simultaneously the positive high voltage, such as 20 V is applied to the row line X and thereby the selecting transistor Q2 of the a specified memory cell MC is turned to ON. At the same a time, the positive high voltage is applied to the drain D of the transistor Q1 and zero voltage is applied to the control gate CG. Thus, the electron charges are removed from the floating gate FG and the logic 1 is written in the memory cell MC . In the memory of Fig. 3, half selected memory a cells, such as M i , MCC and so on, and non selected memory cells, such as MCd and so on, exist at the same time, other than selected memory cell MCa The half selected memory cell is defined as follows. That is, the corresponding column line Y is selected, but, the corresponding row line X is not selected, alternately, the corresponding row line X is selected, but, the corresponding column line Y is not selected. When both column and row lines are not selected, the non selected memory cell is obtained.In this case, an undesired write operation cannot be expected, because no positive high voltage is applied to any drain D of the transistor Q1 in each of the memory cells MCb MC and MC . It should be noted that che write operation is d performed when zero volt is applied to the control gate CG and at the same time the positive high voltage is applied to the drain D. While, when a whole erase operation is required with respect to the memory of Fig. 3, firstly, zero volt is applied to all the column lines Y , secondly, the positive high voltage V H is applied to all the word lines X , and thirdly, the positive high voltage VH is applied to all the control gates CG, which three conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Thus, the electron charges are injected from the drain D into the floating gate FG in each of the transistors Q1 It should be noted that the write operation is performed when zero volt is applied to the control gate CG and at the same time the positive high voltage is applied to the drain D. In the above mentioned write and whole erase operations, no problem occurs. However, certain problem is often expected to occur when a partial erase operation is achieved, such as an erase operation with respect to memory cells comprising each word of 8 bits. If some word is accessed in the memory, only a plurality of memory cells MCs for composing that accessed word must satisfy the aforementioned three conditions, that is, firstly, zero volt is applied to the column lines Y , secondly, the positive high voltage VH is applied to the word line X , and thirdly, the positive high voltage VH is applied to the control gates CC. Thus, electron charges are injected from each drain D into the corresponding each floating gate FG in the selected memory cells of that word. However, the above mentioned problem may often occur in the half selected memory cells, especially the half selected memory cells defined by the row line Xa and the remaining column lines other than the column line Ya , which memory cell corresponds to the memory cells MCs arranged along the row line X shown in Fig. 3. In such half selected a memory cells, not only the word line X but also the program a line PR a are selected. Therefore, the corresponding transistors Q2 of the half selected memory cells are turned ON.Although these transistors Q2 are ON, since the corresponding column lines, except for the line Y , are a left in a floating state, the drains D of the transistors of the half selected memory cells are also left in a floating state through the respective transistors Q2 which are now conductive. In this case, although the positive high voltage is applied to the respective control gates CG of the half selected memory cells, the voltage level of the corresponding drains D are expected to increase toward a high voltage level via a so called capacitor coupling between each gate FG and each corresponding drain D.Therefore, it is also expected, no high electric field is created between each floating gate FG and each corresponding drain D. As a result, it is expected that no undesired erase operation is achieved in each half selected memory cell. However, during actual operation, the previously mentioned problem occurs, that is, undesired erase operation is achieved in such half selected memory cells. The reason for this is as follows. When the positive high voltage is applied to the control gate CG, the voltage level of the floating gate FG is also increased due to a capacitor coupling therebetween. In this case, a channel between the drain D and the source becomes conductive, because of the positive high voltage. ten the channel is conductive, the drain D is not left in the aforesaid floating state but is changed to the same voltage level as that of the source S, which level is 0 V.Consequently, a condition, which is identical to the condition for achieving the erase operation, is satisfied, and thereby undesired erasing occurs in some of the half selected memory cells, where the electron charges are injected from each drain D to each corresponding floating gate FG. The above mentioned undesired erasing may be protected by employing an additional transistor which acts to disconnect the source S from the ground GND, selectively.However, this idea for employing such additional transistor is not perfect in protecting all the undesired erasing. The important matter is to pay attention to the existence of a parasitic capacitor formed between the drain D and the substrate SUB refer to the parasitic capacitor PC shown inFig. 2 . To make the matter worse, the capacitance value of the capacitor PC is considerably large. In addition, the capacitance value of the capacitor PC may further be increased, because a parasitic capacitor, formed between the substrate SUB and the source S, is also added to the parasitic capacitor PC of the drain D. Since the drain D is provided with a large parasitic capacitor, the voltage level at the drain D cannot change at high speed. Accordingly, the voltage level at the drain D cannot increase at high speed when the positive high voltage VH is applied to the control gate CG.In other words, although the voltage level at the gate CG and also the gate FG changes sharply, the voltage level at the drain D cannot change so sharply. Therefore, a condition, corresponding to the erase operation, is unnecessarily satisfied in a moment during the term in which the voltage level at the drain D follows toward the positive high voltage level at the gate CG and saturates the corresponding positive high voltage level. Although such undesired erasing occurs in a very short time, if such undesired erasing occurs many times repeatedly, the stored data will completely be erased from the floating gate FG, which is one of the previously mentioned defects of the prior art. Regarding one memory, in which the row line X and also the corresponding program line PR are activated simultaneously, the control gates CG of the non selected and half selected memory cells, especially the half selected memory cells having non selected row lines X and selected column lines Y, are not selected activated , and accordingly no electron charges are injected from the drains D to the respective floating gates FG. As a result, in such memory, above mentioned undesired erasing cannot be expected to occur. Contrary to the above, regarding another memory in which all the control gates are selected activated to be a positive high voltage VH , similar defects will be produced with respect to the half selected memory cells having selected row lines X and non selected column lines Y. There may be a possibility to eliminate the occurrence of such an undesired erase operation by applying the positive high voltage V not only to the control gate CG but also to the column line Y being connected to the drain D of the programming transistor Q1 However, such possibility is not realized, because a complicated decoder circuit should be incorporated into the memory circuit. It should be noted that the simple decoder circuit of the prior art is sufficient merely to operate to supply high voltage to the column line Y during the erase operation and to make the column line Y to be in a floating state. Fig. 4A depicts an equivalent circuit diagram of each memory cell MC according to the present invention, while,Fig. 4B depicts an equivalent circuit diagram of each memory cell MC of the prior art. Although, each programming transistor Q1 of Figs. 2 and 3 is depicted as a single transistor element, in the actual arrangement of the programming tr nsistors Q1 t each of the transistors Q1 is divided into a first transistor all I acting as a read transistor, having the thick insulation layer IS and a second transistor Q12 t acting as a write erase transistor, having a partially thin insulation layer IS . The essential points of the present invention reside in that, as seen from Fig. 4A, the selecting transistor Q2 ofFig. 2 or 3 is also divided into a first selecting transistor Q21 which is connected in series with the read transistor Qll w as usual, and a second selecting transistor Q22 which is connected in series with the write erase transistor Q12 Fig. 5 illustrates a plan view of a memory cell having the circuit diagram of Fig. 4A, according to the present invention. In Fig. 5, the members having the same reference symbols are identical to those of Fig. 4A. The reference symbol DF denotes a diffusion area. The construction of the memory cell MC shown in Fig. 5 will be clarified with reference to Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9.Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 6 6. Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 7 7.Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown inFig. 5 taken along the line 8 8. Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell shown in Fig. 5 taken along the line 9 9. In Fig. 5, as previously mentioned with reference toFig. 4A, the programming transistor Q1 of Fig. 3 is divided into the read transistor Q11 and the write erase transistor Q12 The selecting transistor Q2 of Fig. 3 is also divided into the first selecting transistor Q21 and the second selecting transistor Q22. The diffusion area DF contains n type impurities therein see Figs. 8 and 9 .The diffusion area DF is electrically connected to the column line Y see Fig. 5 . The diffusion area DF is formed to be a U shaped area, as seen from Fig. 5. The two gates X and CG traverse across and over the diffusion area DF so as to form four transistors Q11 X Q22 at respective cross portions. Under the gates CG, FG and the row line X, channels are created at respective transistors Qll Q22 Especially, in the channel of the transistor Q12 t an n type depletion region is formed. The drain D of the transistor Q12 is shorted with the source S of the transistor Q22 , as seen from the area D S of Fig. 9.The floating gate FG of the transistor Q12 is provided with a relatively thin insulation layer IS thereunder, but, other floating gates are provided with the relatively thick insulation layer IS , as seen from Figs. 8 and 9. This insulation layer IS is thin enough to create the tunnel effect. Regarding the transistor Qll g the impurity density of the substrate, located under the floating gate FG, may not be the same as that of the drain D thereof, alternately, that impurity density may be a value which enables creation of a full depletion state of this transistor, even though electron charges are fully injected into that gate FG. Although, in Fig. 2, the program line PR is arranged in parallel with the row line X, the program line is distributed perpendicular to the row line X and at the same time in parallel with the column line Y, as the program line Y , which may be clarified with reference to Figs. 4A and 5.The program line Y is commonly connected to the control gate CG of each memory cells MC which cells are arranged in parallel with the column line Y. Desired one of the program line Y too can be selected by means of a usual decoder circuit which selects desired one of the column lines Y .The write and erase operations will be clarified with reference to Fig. 10. Fig. 10 illustrates a memory circuit diagram comprised of many memory cells according to the present invention shown in Figs. 5 through 9. In Fig. 10, only two column lines are illustrated as Y and Y , only m n two row lines are illustrated as X. and X. , only two i 3 program lines are illustrated as Y and Y and only four m n memory cells are illustrated as MC. , MC. , MC and MC. im in 3m Further it should be understood that, in each memory cell MC , the locations of the transistors f422 Q12 and e Q11 are reversed with respect to the locations thereof shown in Fig. 5, so as to simplify the illustration of the wiring diagram of Fig. 10. When the write operation is commenced, in the selected one, for example C. , of the im memory cells, the positive high voltage is applied to the column line Y Ym VH zero voltage is applied to the program line Y Y m 0 and the positive high voltage is m applied to the row line X. X. VH , and accordingly, the i i VH f and Q22 are first and second selecting transistors Q21 turned to ON and at the same time the positive high voltage is applied to each drain D of the read and write erase transistor Q11 and Q12 In this case, since zero voltage is applied to the control gate CG, the electron charges are removed from the floating gate FG of the transistor Tut12 to the drain D thereof. Thus, the write operation is completed. In the case as mentioned above, regarding the non selected memory cell MCjn and the half selected memory cells MC. 3n in and MC. , since no positive high voltage V is applied to any drains of the corresponding transistors Q11 and Q12 undesired write operation for these non selected and half selected memory cells cannot be expected to occur. When the whole erase operation is commenced, zero voltage is applied to all the column lines Ym Y n the positive high voltage VH is applied to all the row lines Xi H Xj and the positive high voltage VH is applied to 3 all the program lines Y , Y and thereby the n electron charges are injected from the drain D of each transistor Q12 to the floating gate FG thereof. Thus, the whole erase operation is completed. When the partial erase operation is commenced, a similar condition of the above whole erase operation is satisfied with respect only to the selected memory cell, for example MC That is, zero voltage is applied to the im column line Y , the positive high voltage VH is applied to m the program line Y and the positive high voltage VH is m applied to the row line Xi. In this case, regarding the half selected memory cell MC. having the selected row in line X. and the non selected column line Y , no undesired partial erase operation is performed in such half selected memory cell MC. , nor in identical other half selected in memory cells.This is because, firstly, the corresponding program lines Y and so on are not selected, and ac n cordingly the corresponding control gates CG are left in an open state or zero voltage state, in which no undesired erase operation can be expected to occur. Secondly, regarding the half selected memory cells, for example MCjm , having the non selected row line X, and the selected column line Y, the control gates CG of these half selected memory cells receive the positive high voltage VH , however, the write erase transistors Q12 are left in floating state, and accordingly no undesired erase operation can be performed.Thirdly, in the memory cells, the write erase transistor Q12 is fabricated in a small size, and therefore, the parasitic capacitor refer to PC in Fig. 2 formed between the drain D of the transistor Q12 and the substrated can also be very small in area. Consequently, the voltage level developed at the drain D of the write erase transistor Q12 can quickly follow the change of the voltage level developed at the control gate CG. As previously mentioned, since the parasitic capacitor PC of the prior art is considerably large, undesired erase operation is often performed. Thus, no injection of the electron charges into the floating gate FG is expected in the half selected memory cells.Further, no injection of the electron charges into the floating gate FG is expected in the non selected memory cells. In Fig. 10, when the read operation is achieved, the positive voltage is applied to both the row and column lines X, Y of the selected memory cell MC. If the selected memory cell MC stores the logic 1 no electron charges are held at the floating gate FG thereof , the voltage level of the floating gate is positive, and therefore the threshold level of the selected transistor Q1 is reduced. Thus, the transistor Q11 is left in the normal ON state. In this case, current flows from the column line Y to the ground GND via the transistors Q21 and Qll which are now ON. Contrary to the above, if the selected memory cell MC stores the logic 0 electron charges are held at the floating gate FG thereof , the voltage level of the floating gate FG is negative, and therefore the threshold level of the selected transistor Qll is increased. Thus, the transistor Q1 is left in normal OFF state. In this case, no current flows from the column line Y to the ground GND via the transistors Q21 and Qll As mentioned above, the stored data 1 or 0 is read from each memory cell.In this case, the voltage level at the control gate CG is not restricted to the above mentioned zero voltage, but, may be a suitable positive voltage level which is predetermined, for an erase operation and a write operation, according to the respective threshold levels of the memory cells. The following table I shows the voltage level developed at the row line X, the program line Y and the column line Y, to be supplied in each of the read READ , the write WRITE , the partial erase PARTIAL ERASE and the whole erase THOLE ERASE operations, with respect to the selected memory cell MC , the half selected memory cell MCHSX having S selected row line X only, the half selected memory cell MCHSY having the selected column line Y only and the non selected memory cell MC non Table IEMI14.1 tb SEP MCS SEP SEP MCHSX SEP MCHSY SEP MCnon tb SEP X SEP V4 SEP SEP Vcc SEP V4 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb READ SEP Y SEP V2 SEP or SEP O SEP V2 SEP or SEP O SEP V SEP SEP or SEP O tb SEP Y SEP V3 SEP SEP 0 SEP V SEP 0 SEP tb SEP 3 tb SEP X SEP V1 SEP V1 SEP o SEP SEP o SEP tb WRITE SEP SEP Y SEP O SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP Y SEP V1 SEP o SEP SEP V1 SEP 0 SEP tb SEP X SEP V1 SEP V1 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb PARTIAL SEP ERASE SEP Y SEP V1 SEP 0 SEP V1 SEP 0 SEP tb SEP Y SEP 0 SEP SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP X SEP V1 SEP tb WHOLE SEP ERASE SEP Y SEP V1 SEP all SEP bits tb SEP Y SEP 0 tb In the above cited Table I, the reference symbol V1 denotes the positive high voltage higher than the ordinary power supply voltage level of vVcc the reference symbol V2 denotes a read voltage level at the line Y V3 a read voltage level at the line Y and, V4 a suitable read voltage level at the row line X. As can be understood from Figs. 5 through 9, the memory circuit device of the present invention is easy for producing in mass production. This is because, if slight locational error occurs in the location, with respect to the diffusion area DF of the row line X, the.control gate CG or the floating gate FG, in vertical and or horizontal directions in the drawing of Fig. 5, such locational error does not cause a significant defect in manufactured memory cells, due to the presence of the U shaped diffusion area DF. Fig. 11 illustrates a plan view showing the other embodiment of the memory cell according to the present invention. This figure corresponds to Fig. 5 showing the first embodiment according to the present invention The members referenced by the same reference symbols as those of Fig. 5 are substantially the same. Therefore, a third selecting transistor Q3 and an additional program line Y are newly introduced therein. The third selecting transistor Q3 cooperates with the second selecting transistor Q22. In this case, the previously mentioned program line PR Fig. 2 is composed of the first program line Y and the second program line Y . The second program line Y is coupled to the gate G of the third selecting transistor Q. The channel of the transistor Q3 is also formed inside the U shaped diffusion area DF.The first program line Y is arranged in parallel with the row line X.The second program line Y is arranged in parallel with the column line Y. The line Y is selected by means of the decoder circuit, usually used for selecting a desired one of the column lines Y. Fig. 12 illustrates a memory circuit diagram comprised of many memory cells of another embodiment according to the present invention. However, only two column lines are illustrated as Y and Y , only two row lines are illus m n trated as Xi and X , only two first program lines are I 3 illustrated as Y and Y , only two second program lines are illustrated as Y and Y , and only four memory cells m n are illustrated as MC imt MC in t jm and MC further it should be understood that, in each memory cells roc , the locations of the transistors Q22 t Q12 t Q3 and Q21 Qll are reversed with respect to the locations thereof shown in Fig. 11, so as to simplify the illustration of the wiring diagram of Fig. 11. In Fig. 12, when the column line Ym is selected, the corresponding line Y is also selected, and similarly when m the column line Yn is selected, the corresponding line Y n is selected. When the write operation is commenced, in the selected one, for example C im , of the memory cells, the positive high voltage is applied to the column line Y Y m m VH I the positive high voltage is applied to the second program line Y m Y m VH and the positive high voltage is applied to the row line X. X. VH , and accordingly, the first, 1 1 second and third selecting transistors Q21 Q22 and Q3 are turned to ON and at the same time the positive high voltage is applied to each drain D of the read and write erase transistors Q and Q12 In this case, since zero voltage is applied to the control gate CG, the electron charges are removed from the floating gate FG of the transistor Q12 to the drain D thereof. Thus, the write operation is completed.In the case as mentioned above, regarding the non selected memory cell SCtjn and the half selected memory cells MC in 3n and MC jm t since firstly no positive high voltage VH is applied to the drain of the corresponding transistor Q12 and secondly the corresponding transistors Q22 and Q3 are OFF, undesired write operation for these non selected and half selected memory cells cannot be expected to occur. When the whole erase operation is commenced, zero voltage is applied to all the column lines Y, Y n the positive high voltage V H is applied to all the row lines Xi t Xj ... , the positive high voltage VH is applied to 3 all the first program lines Y 1 g Y ... and the 3 voltage VH is applied to all the second program lines Y m yir ... , and thereby the electron charges are injected from n the drain D of each transistor Q12 to the floating gate FG thereof. Thus, the whole erase operation is completed. When the partial erase operation is commenced, a similar condition of the above whole erase operation is satisfied with respect only to the selected memory cell, for example MC im. In this case, regarding the half selected memory cell MC in having the selected row line X. and the non selected column line Y , the second program line Y is n n also non selected, and accordingly the transistor Q3 is turned to OFF, and the transistor Q12 of the cell MC in becomes a floating state. Consequently, the voltage level of the drain D of this transistor Q12 changes together with the voltage level of the control gate CG and also the floating gate FG of the transistor Q12 in the cell MC in.Thereby, no undesired erase operation can be expected to occur in the half selected memory cell MC in. Regarding the half selected memory cell MC jm having the non selected row line X. and the selected column 3 line Y , since the first program line Y is not selected, m 3 there is no possibility that any electron charges are injected into the floating gate FG of the cell MC jm Regarding the non selected memory cell MC . , since the 3n lines X. , Y , Y and Y are not selected, there is also 3 n n no possibility that any electron charges are injected into the floating gate FG of the cell MC . . This is why no desired erase operation is achieved in any of the memory cells other than the selected memory cell. The read operation of the memory shown in Fig. 12 is substantially the same as that of Fig. 10. In this case, the first program lines Y i , Y j .... of Fig. 12 should be supposed to be the program lines Y m , Y n .... of Fig. 10.The second program line Y m , Y n .... of Fig. 12 can be in free states during the read operation, that is the voltage level of these lines Y , Y may be a high voltage or a m n low voltage level. Thus, operations of the memory shown inFig. 12 are classified as represented by the followingTable II. Table II corresponds to the previously citedTable I.
