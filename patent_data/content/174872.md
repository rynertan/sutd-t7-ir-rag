## Description
This invention relates to a head driving mechanism in a compact auto reverse type tape player for use in, for instance, car stereos and portable VTRs. In an auto reverse type tape player, when a rotary head is moved forward after the direction of the rotary head is changed over, no force in the direction of rotation of the head must be applied to the rotary head. However, if the reversible rotation of one cam gear is used to change the direction of the head and to move the head forward, it will be extremely difficult technically to ensure that an arm or link for rotating the head is kept stationary while the head is moved forward. EP A 0066809 discloses an auto reverse type tape player comprising a rotary head which is coupled to a sector gear so that rotation of the sector gear turns over the head upon a change in the direction of tape drive, the sector gear being linked by linking means to a cam gear which is rotated to and fro to rock the linking means and rotate the sector gear, the sector gear having a boss which is engaged in a U shaped engaging means of the linking means and the rotary head and sector gear being movable axially of the head between a release position and play position relatively to a tape and, according to the invention, such a tape player is characterised in that the boss is tapered and extends from the sector gear in a direction away from the tape such that the boss and the U shaped engaging means are disengaged when the head is moved from its release position towards the play position and the head can only be turned over in the release position, and in that the head is moved between its release and play position by a linkage incorporating a slide lever having a cam crest which is engaged by one or other end of an arcuate cam on a face of the cam gear, and a swivel arm which engages the slide lever and includes an arm arranged to abut a holding piece of the head upon swivelling of the swivel arm by the slide lever the arrangement being such that when the cam gear is rotated in one direction or the other it causes turning over of the head in one direction of the other respectively and movement of the head from its release position to its play position. Preferably, the linking means linking the cam gear and the sector gear comprises two arms, one of which has a groove in which a pin on a face of the cam gear is slidable, the other arm being formed with the U shaped engaging means. In a particular embodiment of the invention, a pair of play idler gears and a pair of pinch rollers are linked to the slide lever such that movement of the slide lever in one direction may bring one of the play idler gears and one of the pinch rollers into play, and movement of the slide lever in the other direction may bring the other play idler gear and the pinch roller into play. In this embodiment, there may be included an idler arm rotatably supported by a chassis, the idler arm having pins passing through holes of a pinch roller holder for supporting the play idler gear pivotally a spring means supported pivotally and coaxially with the pinch roller holder for urging the idler arm toward the play position and a lock arm having a means for holding the idler arm at a position corresponding to the head release position while the lock arm is in the release position, wherein when the release state is transferred to the play state, the pinch roller is made to abut against a capstan first, whereas the idler arm is released from the holding means of the lock and swivelled, whereby the play idler gear is allowed to engage with a reel gear and when the play state is transferred to the release state, the pinch roller is separated from the capstan first and the pin of the idler arm is pushed by the wall of the through hole of the pinch roller holder to cause the idler arm to swivel, whereby the play idler gear is separated from a gear. The linkage means linking the slide lever to the play idler gears and the pinch rollers may also include a pair of swivel arms pivotally linked to the slide lever and symmetrically arranged about a rotary shaft of the head and which swivel sychronously and reciprocably in the same direction upon movement of the slide lever such that one swivel arm moves the head to a play position, while the tape travels in a forward direction, whereas the other swivel arm moves that pinch roller and that play idler gear which correspond to the forward play direction, to an operating position, and when the tape travels in a reverse direction, the one swivel arm moves a second pinch roller and a second play idler gear, corresponding to the reverse play direction, whereas the other swivel arm moves the head to the play position. The invention may also be arranged such that a music search position of the head is achieved when a stop position of the cam gear upon a music search mode, is made different to that upon a play mode to change the position of the slide lever, wherein the plane of contact between the cam crest of the slide lever and the arcuate cam of the cam lever in the music search mode, is shifted from that of the play mode by a predetermined angle with respect to the direction of a straight line connecting the contact and the centre of the cam gear such that the movement of the slide lever is slightly smaller than upon the play mode, and the rotary head stops at a position slightly short of the play position.

The tape player of an automatic reverse type comprises a tape cassette loading and ejecting mechanism, a mechanism for moving a head forwardly and changing the direction thereof, an FF REW mechanism, a main motor MM for driving the mechansims, and first and second submotors SM1, SM2. The construction and operation of those mechanisms will be described subsequently. The mechanism is equipped with a front inlet on the lower side of Figure 1 and righthand side of Figure 2 where a tape cassette 1 is inserted and discharged therefrom and a holder or cage member 2 for directly supporting the tape cassette 1 when inserted, the holder 2 being rotatably supported at the forend of an elevator arm 4. A cassette sliding member 3 is slidably fitted in a long groove 2a formed in the top plate of the cage member 2 and allowed to move from a position A, at which the cassette is inserted, to another position B, at which the cassette is retracted, so that the cassette 1 is inserted and unloaded. The elevator arm 4 has its base end pivotally supported at 4a by a chassis to lower and raise the holder 2 between the retracted position B and a play position C. A bottom plate of the holder 2 is gradually narrowed in width toward the inlet for the tape cassette and a projection 2b slanted downwardly is provided on the front end thereof. Thus, even if the tape cassette 1 is inserted into the inlet for the tape cassette in a twisted state, it will be guided by the projection 2b and its gradually enlarged portion continuous thereto, thereby ensuring the insertion of the cassette in the holder 2. As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, the projection 2b may be provided closer to the centre of the inlet for the tape cassette, but otherwise the projection 2b may be provided at the left or right end of the inlet. As shown in Figure 3 by means of a shaft 3a with a flange portion, the cassette sliding member 3 is slidably engaged with the long groove 2a formed in the top plate of the holder 2. To prevent friction between the metal components, there are provided a cylindrical metal roller 3b, between the shaft portion of the shaft 3a and the wall of the long groove 2a, and a plastic annular washer 3c between the flanged portion of the shaft 3 and an outer surface of the holder 2. The cassette sliding member 3 is equipped in its central portion with a resilient engagement projecting piece 3d with a reel shaft bore of the tape cassette inserted to support the tape cassette 1 with a small elastic pressure. A long pin 5a of a swivel lever 5 Figure 5 swivelling in the horizontal direction in a slit 3e Figure 1 formed at the rear end of the cassette sliding member 3 is engaged with the cassette sliding member 3. The sliding member 3 is moved back and forth by the swivelling of the lever 5 to retract the cassette and to push the cassette outwardly upon the ejection. As shown in an exploded perspective view Figure 5 , the lever 5 is coupled to a first cam lever 6 through a torsion spring 5b and, the torsion spring 5b is wound so that only the swivel lever 5 slightly swivels back. Consequently, as shown in figure 4, the torsion spring 5b is wound by the force of insertion caused when the tape cassette 1 is manually inserted into the inlet of the cassette. As a result the torsion spring 5b causes the cassette sliding member 3 to move back slightly. An operating piece 3f causes a switchlever 7 to swivel and thus the main motor M to start to rotate. The torsion spring 5b is relatively roughly wound and its free length is made several percent longer than a space, where the torsion spring is to be fixed, at the base end of the swivel lever 5. Namely, the spring is mounted in a compressed state. In such a construction, the torsion spring 5b is prevented from being displaced. Even if the torsion spring 5b contacts its support shaft, the contact force therebetween is weakened. As a result, there is no fear that metal powder would be abraded from the support shaft after long use and would scatter. This makes it unnecessary to install a spacer between the torsion spring 5b and the support shaft to prevent the former from touching the latter as is often the case with the conventional apparatus. A driving pin 9a embossed on a carrier later described in detail is fitted in the cam groove 6a of the first cam lever 6 and, when the carrier 9 rotates, the cassette sliding member 3 is caused to move. As shown in Figure 1, upwardly bent portions 2c are formed at the left edge of the holder 2 and at a central portion on the right side of the top plate of the holder 2. An L shaped groove 2d is formed under the bent portion 2c in the top plate see Figure 6 . On both sides of the foreend of the elevator arm 4, there are provided L shaped extensions 4b with each foreend being directed outwardly. As shown in Figure 7, each extension 4b is fitted in the groove 2d of the holder 2. The boss 4b is prepared through the so called half die cutting method and is held at a level slightly lower than the elevator arm 4. Accordingly, an upper edge of the bent portion 2c is prevented from projecting from the surface of the apparatus and this is effective in minimizing the thickness of the tape player in a car stereo. When the elevator arm 4 swivels and reaches the play position as shown in Figure 7B, the extension 4b will be tilted within the groove 2d. The length of the groove 2d on the lefthand side is made slightly longer than the width of the foreend of the extension 4b on the lefthand side. The holder 2 is energized to the right relative to the elevator arm 4 as viewed from the front side, whereby the extension 4b is prevented from falling apart from the groove 2d. The assembly of the holder 2 and the elevator arm 4 is quite simple because it only comprises steps of allowing the extension 4b on the righthand side to be fitted in the groove 2d and the extension 4b on the left to be fitted in the associated groove 2d and urging the holder 2 to the right. As shown in Figures 8A and 8B, there is provided a spring 4c in between the foreend of the elevator arm 4 and the side wall of the chassis. The foreend that is, the holder 2 of the elevator arm 4 is pressed down strongly at the retracted position Figure 8A and weakly at the play position Figure 8B . The elevator arm 4 is made to abut on a second cam lever 8 through the relatively strong spring 4c provided at its base end at the retracted position Figure 8A and hold the holder 2 at the elevated position by means of the force of a spring 4d. As shown in Figure 8B, the elevator arm 4 swivels clockwise when the engaged end of the second cam lever 8 moves back, causing the holder 2 to move to the play position, whereby the second cam lever 8 further moves back and separates from the spring 4d. As shown in Figures 1, 2 and 8, a long leaf spring 4e is produced from the foreend of the elevator arm 4 and the foreend is made to abut against the top plate of the holder 2, giving clockwise swivelling force in the states of Figure 2C and Figure 8B. The aforesaid mechansim is intended to prevent the holder 2 from tilting counterclockwise because of its own weight while it moves from the retracted position Figure 8A to the play position Figure 8B , because the groove 2d of the holder 2 is located ahead of the position of its centre of gravity in the cassette retracted state owing to the fact that the large swivelling amount of the elevator arm 4 is not allowed . Both of the first cam lever 6 and the second cam lever 8 are driven by the driving pin 9a implanted in a carrier 9. Since the shapes of the cam grooves 6a and 8a are such as those shown in Figures 9A and 9B, the first cam lever 6 swivels counterclockwise when the carrier 9 swivels clockwise in the direction indicated by a dotted line and the second cam lever 8 swivels clockwise when the carrier 9 makes the final small swivelling. When the first cam lever 6 swivels, the second cam lever 8 will not swivel whereas when the second cam lever makes the final swivelling, the first cam lever 6 will not swivel. In other words, the cassette sliding member 3 moves back to move the inserted tape cassette 1 to the retracted position first and the elevator arm 4 swivels to lower the tape cassette 1 to the plate position. When the tape cassette 1 is ejected, the carrier 9 swivels reversely and follows a reverse course to discharge the tape cassette. As shown in Figure 10, one flywheel 10 on the forward side, and another 11 of the reverse side, are driven by the main motor MM through a main belt and, dpending on the direction of the travelling tape, either reel table 14 or 15 is driven to rotate through either play idler gear 12 or 13. A large gear 19a mounted coaxially with a sun gear 19 is driven by the play idler gear 12 on the forward side through gears 16 and 18 equipped with loading torque limiters. The first submotor SM1 is used to move the rotary head forward and switch the pinch roller and the play idler gears. The second submotor SM2 is used to switch an FF REW idler gear 22. Figure 11 shows a loading torque limiter mechansim. The large diameter gear 16 is supported in between the small diameter gear 18 and a friction disc 18a a predetermined space apart from and coaxially with the gear 18, whereas a curved elastic spring member 17 equipped with three legs shown in Figure 11B is installed between the gears 16 and 18, whereby the gear 16 is engaged with the friction disck 18a under pressure. With such a mechansim, the engagement of the large diameter gear 16 with the friction disc 18a is released when the tape cassette loading and ejecting mechanism fails in midway and the upstream driving mechansim is prevented from bearing an excessive load. Figure 12 shows a planet gear mechansim for driving the tape cassette loading and ejecting mechansim. A planet gear 20 is engaged with the sun gear 19 fixed coaxially with the large diameter gear 19a and an internally toothed stationary partial ring gear 21 fixed on the chassis coaxially with the sun gear 19. The planet gear 20 is supported by the carrier 9 mounted pivotally and coaxially with the sun gear 19. The driving pin 9a implanted in the carrier 9 is fitted in the cam grooves 6a and 8a of the first cam lever 6 for moving the cassette sliding member 3 and the second cam lever 8 for swivelling the elevator arm 4 see Figure 9 . The operation of the mechanism will be described subsequently. When the main motor MM rotates forward, the sun gear 19 and the planet gear 20 are rotated in the direction of the arrow and, because the planet gear 20 is engaged with the partial ring gear 21, the carrier 9 is made to swivel clockwise and reach the position of Figure 12C, whereby the planet gear 20 is disengaged from the ring gear 21 to stop the carrier 9. Meanwhile, the first and second cam levers 6 and 8 are swivelled to hold in the tape cassette 1 and lower it to the play position. Since the carrier 9 is weakly engaged by friction with the sun gear 19, it is held at the position of Figure 12C, provided that the main motor MM continues to rotate forward. When the main motor MM is rotated reversely, the carrier 9 together with the sun gear 19 will slightly rotate counterclockwise, causing the planet gear 20 to engage with the ring gear 21, and then the carrier 9 will continue to rotate in the direction opposite to counterclockwise that at the time the tape cassette is inserted. The switch lever 7 then rotates to make the main motor MM stop when the carrier 9 has reached the position of Figure 12C. As shown in Figure 13, the mechansim for moving the head forward and changing its direction is driven by a cam gear 23 rotated forward and backward by the first submotor SM1 through a worm and gear 220. The cam gear 23 is vertically arranged on the righthand side in Figure 10 of the first submotor SM1 and a pin 23a extending from a side surface of the cam gear 23 is fitted in a long groove 25a provided in one arm of a dogleg arm link 25 for changing the direction of a rotary head 24, whereas the end of a semicircular cam 23b extending from the same side of the cam gear 23 is arranged to abut against a cam crest 26a of a slide lever 26 which is slidable back and forth in the left and right directions of Figure 13 . Figure 13 illustrates a forward play or music search standby state wherein, if the cam gear 23 rotates in the direction of the arrow, the arm 25 for rotating the head will not rotate practically and only the slide lever 26 in Figure 13 will move to the left, causing the head 24 to move forward and moving the pinch roller and the play idler gear as described later. Moreover, if the cam gear 23 rotates in the direction opposite to what is shown by the arrow in Figure 13, the arm 25 for rotating the head will rotate clockwise, causing the rotary head 24 to move reversely first, and the end of the lefthand side of the semicircular cam 23b in Figure 13 will be allowed to abut against the lefthand side of the cam crest 26a and move the slide lever 26 to the right. The position where the cam gear 23 has rotated and the slide lever 26 has moved at the time of play differs from that at the time of music search. Namely, the rotary head 24 at the time of music search is made to stop slightly before the play position. Figures 14A and 14B illustrate states wherein the semicircular cam 23b of the cam gear 23 is abutting against the cam crest 26a of the slide lever 26, namely, Figures 14A and 14B illustrate such states of music search and play, repsectively. In either state, the contact plane where the semicircular cam 23b is in contact with the cam crest 26a is shifted by a certain angle ϑ for instance, ϑ 20 50 with respect to the direction of a straight line connecting the contact portion and the centre of the cam gear 23 to each other. The reason for that is, as described later, to prevent an error itself in the stop position of the cam gear 23 from being translated to an error in the stop position of the slide lever 26. The stop position of the slide lever 26 is controlled by detecting where the cam gear 23 turns. In other words, such an arrangement is intended to reduce the error in the stop position, whereby accuracy of the stop position of the slide lever 26 can be increased. Moreover, the position where the semicurcular cam 23b abuts against the cam crest 26a upon the music search differs from that upon the play. Consequently an error in the stop position of the slide lever 26 in either position is made adjustable independently. As shown in Figure 15, U shaped engaging means 25b is formed in the other arm of the line 25 for rotating the head 24 Figure 15 is a view on the righthand side and the opposite side to Figure 13 . the engaging means 25b is engaged with a boss 24b on a sector gear 24a for turning the rotary head 24 through 180 so that it may be switched from the forward to reverse side and vice versa as the cam gear 23 rotates. As shown in Figure 16, the boss 24b on the sector gear 24a is equipped at its distal end with a tapered portion and is engaged with the U shaped engaging means 25b of the link 25 for rotating the head only when the rotary head 24 is located in the release position. The boss 24b is separated from the U shaped engaging means 25b as the rotary head 24 moves forward further to the left in Figure 16 to exhibit a wider space therebetween. Accordingly, even if the link 25 slightly swivels when the head 24 is moved forward by rotating the cam gear 23 , the rotary head 24 is prevented from arbitrarily swivelling. When the rotary head 24 is switched from the play to release position, moreover, the preventive measure has also effect in ensuring that the boss 24b engages with the U shaped engaging means 25b of the link 25. On the upper side of the rotary head 24, there is provided an azimuth fixing plate 241 formed of a slender resilient member having holes at opposite end, and forward and reverse azimuth screws 242 and 243 are made to pass through the holes, their screw heads being bonded to the azimuth fixing plate 241. The azimuth fixing plate 241 has its central portion abutted against a head stand 24c. Upon the azimuth adjustment, the plate 241 prevents azimuth screws 242 and 243 from becoming loose and after the adjustment, serves as a basic plate for bonding the screws. There are provided washers 244 formed of a resilient material, such as rubber or plastics, between the azimuth fixing plate 241 and the head stand 24c. Because of the provision of the washers 244, the azimuth fixing plate may be prepared from a frail or non elastic member. In order to control the position of rotation of the cam gear 23, resilient contacts 23c shown in Figure 17A are provided on the righthand face of the cam gear 23 and are in sliding contact with a metal pattern shown in Figure 17B and formed on the opposing wall of the chassis. As shown in Figure 18, the slide lever 26 is equipped with recesses 26b for engagement at both ends on the upper and lower sides in Figure 18 . Pins 27a and 28a of swivel arms 27 and 28 symmetrically provided at the front and rear of the rotary head 24 are respectively fitted in the recesses 26b to cause the swivel arms 27 and 28 to swivel. The swivel arms 27 and 28 are made to swivel synchronously in the same direction one of which is used to move the head forward and the other to move the pinch rollers and the play idler gears on the forward or reverse side depending on the travel direction of the tape. Since the construction and operation of the swivel arms 27, 28 are completely symmetrical relative to the rotary head 24, only those of the rear swivel arm 27 will be described. The swivel arm 27 consists of, as shown in Figures 19A and B, curved member 27b abutting against a pinch spring 29b of a pinch roller holder 29, an arm 27c abutting against the contact 30c of a lock arm 30 and an arm 27d abutting against the hold piece 24d of the head stand 24c. the pinch holder 29 is normally urged counterclockwise by a spring not shown mounted on a support shaft 29d. Moreover, a pin 31a extending from an idler arm 31 is loosely inserted into a through hole 29a provided in a plate member under the pinch holder 29. The lock arm 30 and an idler arm 31 are arranged under the pinch roller holder 29. The lock arm 30 and the pinch roller holder 29 are coaxially supported by a shaft 29d on the chassis, the lock arm 30 being equipped with a spring 30a for urging the idler arm 3l counterclockwise and holding means 30b for holding the idler arm 31 at the release position. The idler arm 31 in the state of Figure 19B has a hook 31b held by the holding means 30b of the lock arm 30 and is located at the release position, whereas its pin 31a is made to abut against the left end of the through hole 29a of the pinch roller holder 29. The operation in the case of the forward play will be described. The slide lever 26 is moved back upward in Figure 18 to make the swivel arm 27 swivel counterclockwise and the pinch holder 29 is caused to swivel clockwise by the curved member 27b. As a result, the pinch roller is attached under pressure to the forward side of the capstan. subsequently, the contact 30c of the lock arm 30 is pushed by the arm 27c and swivelled clockwise. The holding means 30b is released from the hook 31b to allow the idler arm 31 to swivel counterclockwise by the force of energizing the spring 30a and the play idler gear 12 to engage with the reel gear 14b. At this time, the front swivel arm 28 is also synchronously swivelled counterclockwise and its arm 28d is made to abut on the holding piece 24d of the head stand and move the head stand 24c to the play position. When the play state is changed to the release state, the slide lever 26 moves forward, causing the swivel arm 27 to swivel clockwise. The idler arm 31 will remain at the play position even if the lock arm 30 swivels counterclockwise, because the idler arm 31 is energized by the spring 30a. When the pinch roller holder 29 is swivelled counterclockwise, the pinch roller separates from the capstan and the pin 31a of the idler arm 31 is pressed against the left end of the through hole 29a of the pinch roller holder 29, whereby the idler arm 31 swivels clockwise. Then, the play idler gear 12 separates from the reel gear 14b. The hook 31b of the idler arm 31 is held by the holding means 30b of the lock arm 30. The timing the pinch roller is operated is shifted from the timing of operation of the play idler gear. Consequently, the tape is prevented from shifting at the time the release state is transferred to the play position, whereby the head of a piece of music is made free from being out of tune. Moreover, tape slackening can be compensated for when the play state is transferred to the release state. In the reverse play mode, the swivel arms 27 and 28 are made to swivel in the direction opposite to that in the case of the forward play and their roles are reversed. In the music search mode, the amount of movement of the slide lever 26 is slightly smaller and the rotary head 24 stops at a position slightly before the play position, so that the pinch roll and the play idler will not reach the operating position. Figure 20 is a cross sectional view of a torque switching mechanism provided under the reel stand 14 and 15 . Annular friction faces 14a and 14d with felt material and artificial leather are formed on the surface opposite to two discs coaxially mounted on the reel stand 14, whereas the large and small diameter reel gears 14b and 14c prepared from polyacetal are rotatably supported therebetween. A coil spring 14e is provided in between the large and small diameter reel gears 14b, 14c and used to press the two reel gears against the upper and lower friction faces so as to obtain a proper friction coefficient for instance, µ 0.18 and µ 0.49 , respectively. The large diameter reel gear 14b is used for play, whereas the small diameter one 14c for FF REW. The same friction coefficient may be obtained by using an inorganic polyacetal additive in place of artificial leather as the annular friction face 14d. As shown in Figure 21, a guide roller 33 having an outer diameter slightly larger than that of the shaft is rotatably mounted on the upper end of the shaft supporting a pinch roller holder 29 on this side and, when a tape cassette is inserted, it will be guided by the guide roller 33 and smoothly inserted into the cage member 2. As shown in Figures 22 and 23, the FF REW operation is implemented through steps comprising rotating a switching gear 34 arranged perpendicularly on the righthand of the second submotor SM2 through a worm and gear 230 to swivel an L shaped arm 35 and engaging the FF REW gear 22 between the forward side fly wheel 10 and the reel gear 14c or between the reverse side fly wheel 11 and the reel gear 15c. The elastic contact point and the metal pattern shown in Figures 17A and 17B are also provided on the righthand face of the switching gear 34 and the chassis wall opposite thereto, whereby they are made to slide thereon to allow the production of a detection signal for controlling the rotational position of the switching gear 34. The second submotor SM2 is installed at the corner where the top plate and vertical wall of the chassis intersect using one auxiliary elastic plate 36 but without using fastening means such as screws. As shown in Figure 24, the auxiliary elastic plate 36 consists of a flat plate having cut bent portions 36a, 36b, 36c alternately extending in different directions and two bends 36d continuously connected to the former. The top plate of the chassis is supplied with, as shown in Figure 25 shown upside down for clarification , bent pieces 37, 38 having U shaped grooves 37a, 38a into which the fore and rear ends of the bearing of the submotor SM2 are fitted. there are formed claws 37b, 38b, respectively, extending toward the vertical side wall at the upper ends of the U shaped grooves 37a, 38a on the opposite sides of the vertical wall. There are also formed two engagement holes 39 in the vertical wall, the bends 36a and 36c of the auxiliary elastic plate 36 being fitted in the engagement holes 39. Figure 26 shows a state wherein the aforesaid parts are fitted in. The fore and rear ends of the bearing of the second submotor SM2 are fitted in the U shaped grooves 37a and 38a. When the auxiliary elastic plate 36 is inserted with pressure from the upside in Figure 26 into the space between the submotor SM2 and the vertical wall, the bends 36a and 36c are fitted in the engagement holes 39 of the vertical wall. The bend 36b extending from the vertical wall in the opposite direction serves to press the submotor SM2 in the direction indicated by an arrow. Consequently, the submotor SM2 is firmly held by the two bends 36d of the auxiliary elastic plate and the claws 37b and 38b of the U shaped grooves. Although the submotor SM2 will be prevented from slipping off even though the claws 37b and 38b of the U shaped grooves are not provided, the presence of such claws will help the submotor firmly fixed. When it is needed to remove the submotor SM2, the bends 36a and 36c of the auxiliary elastic plate are pushed strongly by using, for instance, a screwdriver to release then from the engagement holes 39. Then the submotor SM2 can readily be removed if the auxiliary elastic plate 36 is pulled out. The fitting mechanism is applicable to what employs walls or holding means as the bottom and four sides of a case and what can be fitted and removed from the upside only. The operation of the mechanism as a whole will now be described briefly. When the tape cassette 1 is inserted from the front, the switch lever 7 is pushed thereby and the main motor MM is started to hold in the tape cassette and lower it to the play position. Subsequently, the first submotor SM1 operates to move the head forward to cause the switching of its direction. The main motor then continues to rotate forward and allow the reproduction of, e.g. pieces of music, followed by what has been given previously for instance, from the beginning of the reverse play, provided that the forward play has been completed previously . When the operating buttons such as MUSIC SEARCH, REV, FF, REW, etc. are depressed, the first or second submotor will operate and provide desired operation. When a tape has been played back both ways or the eject button is depressed after part play, the main motor will rotate reversely, raising and ejecting the tape cassette, and the operation is completely stopped.
