# Device for detecting the position of an object.

## Abstract
In prior art object position detectors using a radia tion source 32, a beam splitting prism 30 and a radiation sensitive detection system 34, 35 to detect the position of an object 10 relative to a base, the detector com ponents have been positioned on the object and base so that electrical leads must be taken to both object and base. Alternatively a large and heavy auxiliary mirror was mounted on the object. In the invention, only the prism 30 is mounted on the object 10 and it can be small and light. Each detector 34 and 35, of the detec tion system is divided into two sub detectors 36, 37 and 38, 39, the outputs of which are combined in two ways 51, 52, 53, 54 to provide two outputs Sy and Sx
