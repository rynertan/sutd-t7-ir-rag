# Brake pad wear detection system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a brake pad wear detection system which includes a sensor loop 18 embedded in a brake pad 16 , the sensor loop being broken when the wear to the pad 16 exceeds the working limit 19 . In a known system, an indicator means is energised when the loop is broken but this system suffers from the disadvantage that no warning is given when wear to the pad is approaching the working limit. In order to overcome this, the system of the invention includes a detecting means which detects contact between the sensor loop 18 and a conductive braking face 14 which engages the brake pad 16 during braking, as well as detecting breakage of the sensor loop 18 .
