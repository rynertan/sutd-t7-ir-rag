# Aerofoil sail.

## Abstract
A reversible aerofoil comprises a central panel 10 with lateral panels 12A, 12B hinged to opposite edges. The lateral panels can be hinged so that either one overlies the central panel while the other is extended, thereby producing alternative mirror image aerofoils. The lateral panels can be hinged so that they both overlie the central panel, thereby producing a stowed configuration. The shape of the panels is such that in the stowed configuration the profile of the outside surfaces of the lateral flaps match that of the central panel, thereby allowing a cross section to be produced which edge on is substantially symmetrical, preferably ellip tical, thereby producing a low drag aerodynamically stable stowed configuration.
