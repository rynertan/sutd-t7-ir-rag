# A process for selectively removing minor amounts of beta chloroacroleins and 5,6 epoxyhexene 1 from epichlorohydrin.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for selectively removing minor amounts of beta chloroacroleins and 5,6 epoxyhexene 1 from a mixture made up predominantly of epichlorohydrin, characterized by treating said mixture with hydrogen at a temperature of between 20 C and 150 C in the presence of a catalyst comprising rhodium, platinum or palladium deposited on a non acidic, refractory support, in an amount of from 0.05 to 10 by weight on the total catalyst and to epichlorohydrin whenever prepared by means of this process.
