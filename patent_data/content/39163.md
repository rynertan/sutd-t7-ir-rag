## Description
METHOD AND MEANS FOR ELECTROMAGNETICSTIMULATION OF A VEGETATIVE PROCESSBackground of the I rive n t ion This invention relates to the treatment of living plant cells by altering their interaction with charged species in their environment. In particular, the invention relates to a controlled modification of plantcell growth behavior by the application of encoded electrical information. More particularly, the invention provides for the intra cellular application, via noncontacting direct inductive coupling, of one or more electrical voltage and concommitant current signals conforming to a highly specific pattern. Several attempts have been made in the past to elicit a response of living cells and or tissue to electrical signals. Much of this work is reviewed and discussed in Ryaby, et al. Patent No. 4,105,017, particularly insofar as such responses have been elicited for human and other animal cell behavior. Reference is made to said patent for extensive background discussion. have discoveredthat certain highly beneficial modifications of otherwise normal plant cell metabolism may be specifically and selectively induced via electro magnetic coupling using apparatus and techniques having much in common with that disclosed in said patent and in pending Ryaby, et al. application Serial No. 887,485, filed March 17, 1978.Brief Statement of the Ifl vCnti on It is an overall object of the invention to provide a method and means for selectively eliciting, via electromagnetic coupling, a specifically modified plant cell response. It is another object to achieve the foregoing object in specific application to selectively accelerated seedgermination. Another object is to achieve said overall object in specific application to plant root development. A further object is to achieve said overall object in specific application to selective retardation or stopping of normal plant cell development. It is a still further object to achieve said overall object in specific application to accelerated meristem culture development. A further overall object is to provide method. and means for evoking the non linear electrical response of a plant cell in selective enhancement or diminution of the characteristic electrochemical behavior of the cell. The foregoing objects and various further features of novelty are achieved by the invention, wherein growth behavior of living plant cells is selectively altered by electromagnetically inducing low level voltage and concommitant current pulses of specific time frequencyamplitude relations therewith. More particularly, by controlled application of particular excitation levels and repetition rates of such pulses, it is found that such normal plant development processes as seed germination, root development and ripening may be selectively accelerated or retarded.Detailed Description The invention will be illustratively described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a simplified view in perspective, to show electromagnetic apparatus of the invention, operative upon specimen slant cells in a removable container Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view of the removable container of Fig. 1, specifically fitted for accelerated germination and initial root development of specimen plant seeds Fig. 3 is an electrical block diagram schematically showing means for exciting the apparatus of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a waveform diagram to illustrate operation of the apparatus when thus excited Fig. 5 is a diagram to illuminate discussion of dual coil placement considerations and Figs. 6 to 9 are simplified vertical sectional diagrams to illustrate various apparatus modifications and different plant biology applications of the invention. In Fig. 1, plant seed to be subjected to the method of the invention is suitably supported within an open box like container 10 of non paramagnetic material, and the container is removably positionable upon a supporting shelf, 11 which extends between two parallel upstanding sidewalls 12 13. Spacer bars 14 15 connect corresponding upper corners of the sidewalls 12 13 to assure their parallel relation. The sidewalls 12 13 are generally square, and each of them mounts an electrical coil A B which may be preformed and then assembled, as by means of suitable adhesive or ties, to the outer exposed face of the associated wall 42 13 and the entire coil mounting structure 11 12 13 14 15 is also of non paramagnetic material.The coils A B are duplicates of each other and are interconnected in flux aiding relation, when excited by a suitable source as shown, they are electrically connected in parallel. The seedsupporting volume of container 10 is preferably sized and positioned on shelf 11 so as to enclose all cells to be treated, within the geometrical volume defined by and between the coils A B also, the spacing S between coils A B is preferably less than the effective diameter of the respective coils, as will later be explained in connection with Fig. 5. The particular coils A B inFig. 1 are square and therefore their effective diameter may be approximated by the peripheral extent of the square, divided by s. Fig. 2 shows illustrative seed retaining detail, within the container 10. Each of plural seeds 16 is supported in a moist environment, by and between spaced cotton tufts 17, over a bed 18 of moisture retaining material such as cotton, the cotton being wetted to assure the moist environment for each of the seeds 16. Referring to Fig. 3, a variable d c supply 30 is coupled through gate means 32 to the treatment coil 22 or coils, as the case may be and as will more fully appear below in conjunction with the apparatus ofFig. 1, the coil s 22 of Fig. 3 will be understood to symbolize connection to the line 20 which serves coilsA and B. The gate 32 is under the control of control units 34 36, which cause a pulse signal consisting of repetitive pulses of electrical potential to be applied to the coil means 22. Each pulse cycle, as shown in Fig. 4, is composed of a pulse portion P1 of first polarity followed by a pulse portion P2 of opposite polarity.The control units 34 36 may typically be monostable multivibrators, e.g., to generate appropriate timing signals, and they may be variable to control pulse duration and repetition rate within desired limits, while the use of a variable d c supply 30 permits variation of the pulse signal amplitude as desired. With the pulse generator apparatus thus far described, the output signal for coil excitation is in what has been described as Mode 1, being a steady succession of asymmetrical voltage pulses, the asymmetry being attributable to different time constants and being characterised first pulses P1 of lesser amplitude V1 and greater duration T1, as compared with second pulses P2 of greater amplitude V2 and lesser duration T2, there being a dwell T3 between successive pulse cycles, depending upon circuit constants. The Mode 1 signal will produce cell modulating effects, but I have thus far found a pulse train or Mode 2 excitation signal to be preferred for plant cell stimulation. When pulse train operation Mode 2 is employed, additional timing circuitry similar to units 34 and 36 is employed to define the burst segment duration and the burst segment repetition rate. As shown, control units 35 37 control gate 33 to produce a coil excitation signal of the described asymmetrical nature, but wherein the control units 35 37 determine the number of pulses in a burst and the time between successive bursts of pulses. It has been found that the signal across the treatment coil or coils, and hence the induced signal within plant cells under treatment, should satisfy certain criteria. These criteria will be specified with respect to the signal as induced in the cells under treatment.Such induced signal may be monitored, if desired, by use of an auxiliary monitoring probe or pickup coil not shown which is positioned at a distance from the coilsA B corresponding to the distance of the plant cells under treatment from such coils, as is explained in detail in said patent. It suffices here to state that a typical pickup coil that has been employed is circular, about one half centimeter in diameter, and with about 67 or 68 turns of small gauge enamel coated wire. The potential developed by the coil is divided by the length of the wire in centimeters to provide an induced voltage per centimeter number that is closely related to the volts per centimeter induced in the plant cells under treatment. EXAMPLE In order to demonstrate efficacy in application to plant cells, five identical structures as described in connection with Fig. 1 were identically prepared as discussed in connection with Fig. 2, using a batch of six beans in each of the containers 10. The beans were a commercially available hybrid variety of bushtype green beans, known as tendercrop . Care was taken that each bean was individually supported in substantially the same moisture environment, involving tap water wetting of the supporting cotton elements 17 18.Each of the coils A B was of generally square configuration, 4 in. by 4 in., to define a 16 in. perimeter, having an effective diameter of about 5 inches, being defined by 60 turns of No. 16 enamel coated copper wire and the spacing S between coils was 2.5 inches. Coil excitation with the circuit of Fig. 3 provided a firstpulse amplitude V1 of 15 mv and duration T1 of 200 psec. and a second pulse amplitude V2 of 180 mv and durationT2 of 12use., with a short dwell T3 of 8psec. between pulses. Bursts of five milliseconds were administered concurrently to each batch, at different burst repetition rates, and there was no other variable. The ambient temperature within each batch remained substantially constant at 200C 0.50C., and the treatment continued for five days and nights, with all batches receiving the same quantum of normal indoor sunlight exposure.A control sample batch of beans was supported in an identical moist cotton environment in a sixth container 10 which was not exposed to the time varying magneticflux environment applicable to the five like Fig. 1 systems. At the end of the five days, the beams in containers 10 were inspected for signs of germination and root development, with the following results Burst Burst Repetition Root LengthBatch Duration Rate mea n 1 5 ms 5 kHz 0 2 5 ms 10 kHz 0.5 inch 3 5 ms 15 kHz 1.5 inch 4 5 ms 20 kHz 1.5 inch 5 5 ms 25 kHz 3 4 inch 6 None Not applicable 0 In all cases, except for the control sample of batch 6, the probe coil measurement at the region of seed immersion in the applicable magnetic field, indicated and confirmed the. above noted values of V1, V2, T1, T2 and T3 within all bursts. And a platinum wire resistance element applied to one bean of each batch failed to indicate any appreciable rise in temperature throughout the five day exposure to the moist and time varying magnetic environments the platinum element had the capability of measuring a 0.010C rise in temperature, if such rise had occurred. It is concluded from the foregoing example that a definite window exists for favorable and effective acceleration of the germination and root development phases of the growth cycle of the indicated plant cells. And from basic similarity between all varieties of plant cells, an analogous conclusion is justified a for corresponding phases of the growth cycle of other plant cell varieties and b for other phases of the growth cycle for all plant cell varieties. In all cases, it is considered important for most favor able and uniformly predictable results that magneticflux distribution be substantially uniform and uniformly oriented substantially parallel to the coil axis in the region of plant cell exposure and treatment. The latter point will be briefly discussed in connection with the pair of circular coils A B of Fig. 5. On an elemental basis, it is convenient to consider the circular coil situation depicted in Fig. 5, wherein like circular coils A B of inside diameter D1 are positioned on a common central axis of symmetry, at parallel planes which are spaced apart by the distanceS, and wherein the coils A B are excited in flux aiding relation. If the spacing S is sufficiently small in relation to the diameter D1, then substantially all flux lines within coils A B will extend continuously therebetween, on a generally straight alignment which may even neck down, as suggested by the profile 40. If the spacing S is greater again in relation to the diameterD1 , some stray flux lines 41 will develop, to the detriment of the development of uniform high density flux in the central span S.Generally, in view of the necking down 40 ,and in view of the treatment zone being generally at the center of span S, it is convenient to consider the coils A B as being desirably effective in producing the uniform flux distribution over an imaginary cylinder 42 of diameter DX, tangent to the neck down profile 40. From experience to date, it can be stated that for plant cell application of the character presently described, the span S should be equal to or less than the diameter D1, and of course D2 the effect ive diameter of the zone of plant cell treatment will always be considerably less than D1, being substantially equal to D1 only when coils A B are closely adjacent. As a practical consideration in the application of dual coils to a plant cell specimen or batch, it is believed that the nominal inside diameter D1 of the coils should be at least 1.5 times the diameter D2 of the effective cell treatment zone, and this has been found to be a reliable approach for coil spacing S substantially equal to the inside diameter D1. Further applications, methods and structures of the invention will be indicated in discussion of the successive embodiments of Figs. 6 to 9. In Fig. 6, a container 50 of non paramagnetic material is filled with plant seeds for which the germ ination phase is to be accelerated for example, a normal germination period of about three weeks is to be reduced to a few days. The seeds in container 50 are covered with water while, say, one of the burst repetition rates for one of samples 2 to 5 given above characterizes the 5 msec. bursts of pulses delivered via flux aiding coils A B. After such exposure, the seeds are well along in their germination.phase and may be set out for planting.It will be seen that by making possible such accelerated germination, the plant farmer need not suffer from a spring season subject to late cold spells. He can await the arrival of assuredly good weather, accelerate germination through the moist and pulse characterized varying magnetic field, and then plant without fear of having lost an important part of the growing season. Fig. 6 also illustrates application of the invention to acceleration of a meristem culture development, applicable for example to propagation of certain plants such as orchids. In that event, the container 50 may suitably be a flask containing comminuted plant buds in a liquid nutrient medium, consisting illustratively of coconut milk for hormones , fish emulsion for fertilizer , and a saline solution of roughly the salinity of plant tissues. The development of such comminuted buds into as many discrete plants is greatly accelerÅated by the exposure of the thus laden flask50 to the time varying magnetic field established by and between coils A B. In the arrangement of Fig. 7, horizontal coilsA and B each encircle a non paramagnetic pot or vessel 55, at a vertical spacing between coils that is less than the coil diameter, thus establishing vertical orientation of magnetic lines in a substantially uniform high density flux distribution between the coils. The arrangement is favorably suited to the rapid development of root structure 56 from plant cuttings 57 which have been planted in a moist suitable rooting medium 58, such as potting soil, vermiculite, or sand illustrative plants applicable to such stimulation of potted cuttings include african violets, gardenias, and species of ficus including rubber plants. Again, a process normally requiring several weeks is reducible to several days, upon application of specific excitation signal patterns to the coils A B, connected in flux aiding relation. The arrangement of Fig. 8 will be recognized for its similarity to Fig. 7, the difference being one of scale, in that pieces of fruit 60 are stored within the non paramagnetic container 61, in preferably stacked and spaced array as determined by separation sheets 62. If the fruit 60 was picked short of full ripeness, then application of suitable low level timevarying excitation signals to coils A B will create a cell metabolism enhancing environment, to enable accelerated ripening to completion, for such quantities of fruit as may be presently needed in quickly ripened condition.If on the other hand, the fruit 60 is already ripe and is being stored for postponed use, then preferably air within container 61 is displaced by an atmosphere of nitrogen, and the protective atmosphere is retained by suitable cover means 63 at the same time a regimen of excitation signal amplitudes and patterns is established by adjustments within the circuit ofFig. 3, whereby cells within the fruit 60 are subjected to metabolism inhibiting pulses. In other words, for plant cell storage and prese rvation purposes, one selects excitation pulse levels which are high enough to substantially frustrate and prevent the normal metabolism phase associated with over ripening. The arrangement of Fig. 9 will be recognized for its similarity to Fig. 7, in that plant cuttings have been potted in moist medium 58, but the nonparamagnetic pot or container 70 mounts but a single multi turn coil 71 which circumferentially envelops the vertical wall structure, for the full vertical extent of container 70. It goes without saying that such a single coil 71 amply provides the capability of establishing high density uniform flux distribution within the potted volume containing the cuttings 57 and that, therefore, magnetically induced stimulation of the cuttings for root development may be as effective as in the case of Fig. 7. A full and complete understanding of the mechanism by which plant cell growth is modified by the invention has yet to be given. It is presently believed, however, that each plant cell importantly includes an outer layer which in the indicated moist environment is relatively conductive, thus establishing for each cell what may be viewed as a shorted single turn secondary, inherently susceptible to voltage induction and therefore voltage generation within each cell that is exposed to the timevarying magnetic field established by the particular excited treatment coil or coils.It is believed that each cell exhibits non linear electrical response to cell induced voltage in the presence of a low level time varying magnetic field, the net electrochemical response of each cell during each cycle of a timevarying signal being given by EMI16.1 where AP is the net perturbation for the basic waveform of said signal, where said signal has opposed successive polarity segments of duration T1 and T2, respectively, and where TM1 and TM2 are the respective forward and reverse time constants of said cell. Thus, non linearity in the response of the cell itself may perhaps be as much responsible as any other factor in achieving the described results. For a low level time varying electrical signal of arbitrary waveform to achieve a net biological effect, it is believed that the receiver the plant cell must possess non linear characteristics. For example, if a net perturbation i.e., net, over a period of time of the amount of a specifically adsorbed bound ion at a cell membrane site is the target or goal, then the use of induced current can cause this to occur only if the process exhibits a certain degree of irreversability i.e., non linearity in the case of plant cell stimulation, it is be lieved that activation of calciumbinding protein may be specifically involved in addition, it appears that adsorption and or transmembrane passage of cations e.g., Ca , Na , are also believed to be significant to the response. This non linear property is also coupled with the basic kinetics relaxation time of the process. In other words, the parameters of the perturbing signal must be such that efficient coupling to the biological cell process can be achieved without such excessive amplitude as would remove the signal from the low level category and would invite the occurrence of other non electrical effects, such as thermal effects, which it will be recalled from the present specific example are not .measurably present for the low level amplitude example given. Quantitative assessment of the manner by which informational signals coupled to cellular processes having the just described characteristics can be achieved by considering that i a surface process is involved, ii its basic kinetics are exponential in nature, iii net response during each cycle of a signal of arbitrary waveshape is given by the above indicated expression for AP, the net perturbation occurring for the duration of the waveform i.e.,T1 T2 , iv the various repetitive natures of the signal burst and or repetition rate, as well as the basic waveform timing characteristics can be conveniently quantitated via spectral analysis using Laplace transformation, and v the overall net perturbationAP can then be described in terms of its frequency content in the context of the electrical waveform characteristics. In the above manner, the desirable characteristics of a waveform of any shape can be chosen to provide a correlation between its frequency spectrum as determined by the electrochemical cell surface process and the elicited biological response. Generally, there will be an amplitude range or ranges over which the system receives an adequate dose to modulate function. The number of specific ranges depends upon system complexity. In other words, the more biological stages having distinct control processes, the more amplitude ranges may be present for selective operation upon the different control processes. The described invention will be seen to have achieved the stated objects. In the aspect of plantcell germination and root development, the invention is found to achieve truly striking results with important and beneficial economic and environmentalimpact implications. While the invention has been described in detail for the specific illustrative apparatus and example, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
