# Method and reagent for counteracting lipemic interference.

## Abstract
A method and reagent for counteracting lipemic interfer ence in an assay of a lipid containing sample, e.g. blood. The method includes the steps of a mixing with the sample prior to or during said assay a high surface area, finely divided adsorbent having an affinity for lipids, and a nonionic, water soluble polymer, and b precipitating adsorbed lipids in said sample. The reagent includes a high surface area finely divided adsorbent, and a nonionic, water soluble polymer having a molecular weight of from about 1,000 to 100,000.
