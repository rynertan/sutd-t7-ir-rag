# Polycrystalline diamond body and method of making same.

## Abstract
An adherently bonded polycrystalline diamond body is produced by forming a charge composed of a mass of diamond crystals in contact with a mass of eutectiferous siliconrich alloy wherein the alloy is in contact or in association with hexagonal boron nitride, confining such charge within a reaction chamber, subjecting the confined charge to a pressure of at least 25 kilobars, heating the pressure maintained charge to a temperature sufficient to melt the alloy and at which no significant graphitization of the diamond occurs whereby the alloy infiltrates through the interstices between the diamond crystals producing said body.
