# Laminate of metal sheet material and threads bonded thereto, as well as processes for the manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a laminate composed of two, three, four or more metal sheets. The metal sheets 2 , which may for instance be of an aluminium alloy, are bonded together by means of adhesive layers 3 . In the adhesive layers there are embedded poly paraphenylene terephthalamide or carbon threads 4 having a high modulus of elasticity. In the unloaded state of the laminate in its entirety there is a compressive stress in the range of 0 to 200 or 300 N mmÂ² in each metal sheet and a tensile stress in each layer with threads. The mate rial according to the invention is in the first place meant for use in the field of aircraft or spacecraft engineering. However, it also may with advantage find application in various other fields of engineering where high demands are made on static, dyna mic fatigue properties and damage tolerance.
