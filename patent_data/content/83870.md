# Apparatus for treatment of atherosclerotic occlusions.

## Abstract
A novel balloon catheter apparatus for treatment of atherosclerotic occlusions within the cardiovascular system, comprising a catheter defining a through going lumen 22 , a fluid supply means 26 attached to one end of the catheter for supplying fluid through the lumen 22 , and a balloon 24 attached to the other end of the catheter which is inflatable by forcing fluid through the lumen. A pulse generator 25 is also attached to the catheter for generating pressure pulses in the fluid through the lumen 22 , which pulses cause the balloon 24 to sharply expand and contract at intervals. The pulse generator 25 preferably includes a pulse syringe 12 communicating with the lumen 22 , a spring driven ram 36 to contact the piston 14 of the pulse syringe 12 , and a cam rotor 34 to move the ram 36 away from the piston 14 , thereby compressing the spring 40 until the cam 34 rotates further and the ram 36 is released to strike the piston 14 . When the balloon catheter is inserted in the cardiovascular system of the patient and guided to the occlusive site, the balloon is first inflated by the supply means until the balloon contacts the occlusive material, and then one or more pulses may be applied by the pulse generator through the fluid to rapidly expand and contract the balloon. Since the occlusive material is much more brittle than the surrounding wall, the wall expands in response to the pressure pulses while the occlusive material cracks and separates from the wall to be removed through normal cardiovascular processes.
