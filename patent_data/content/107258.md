## Description
PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A GARMENT, AND GARMENT MADE ACCORDING TO THIS PROCESSThe invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a garment. Garments are generally made from flexible materials with a view to fitting close to the human body or tightly enclosing the human body or a part therof having a certain size. The material may be knitted wool, woven elastic and, in modern times especially, any material in a large category publicized as stretch materials.It is an object of the present invention to utilize the mechanical properties of such garments in combination with the electrodes interconnected by these, so that in the wearing of such garments a constant and automatically maintained galvanic low impedance contact between distant spots on the human skin is realized, without requiring any special provisions that would be found cumbersome. In the present invention this object is attained by the characteristic that on the side of the garment to be turned to the body at least a first and a second pressure electrode are fitted, which are in galvanic contact through an otherwise insulated flexible conductor of sufficient length to bridge the distance between the interconnected pressure electrodes as measured on the garment when applied to the body.The present invention is distinct from another one in this domain Roger Yallouz invention in France No. 1 541 165, patent granted on 26 August 1968, in which a single conduction electrode is applied to the skin and a wire connected therewith is passed round the body or part of the body in the following respects 1 The present invention invariably makes use of at least two pressure electrodes which are interconnected by an insul tated wire. 2 In the present invention it is generally sufficient for the wire connecting two adjacent pressure electrodes to run substantially along one side of the body. It has been found that the wearing of such a garment enables equalization of muscular tone and, therefore, also of the supply o blood to and the temperature in different organs and muscle bundles.The invention also relates to a garment made according to the aforesaid process, in the manufacture of which means of adjustment to size have been used in order to enclose tightly a human body or part of the body of various sizes. The adjustment may be done with a lace, a cling fastener, a belt with buckle or in some other manner. In a very advantageous embodiment of the invention the garment is wholly or partly made in elastic material.The locations of the respective pressure electrodes generally correspond with points known in acupuncture. For a description of these points, one may consult An Outline of Chinese Acupuncture , compiled by the Academy of Traditional Medicine and published by Foreign Languages Press, Peking 1975. The application of the external conductor s in particular affects the electropotential relation between these acupuncture points and therewith the mechanical state of stress. It appears that especially an unduly great difference in electric tension between points in the human body corresponds with great differences in tension between various spots acupuncture points . For details refer to R.Voll Topographische Lage der Messpunkte derElektroakupunktur nach Voll l, Uelzen 1976The garment may also be designed as a combination of two or more of the aforesaid garments As the need arises, it may also be modelled differently in order to envelop the head, knee, neck, chest or other parts of the body and to have a relaxing, soothing or therapeutic effect through equalization of the electric skin potential. The conductor may be designed as a single or multiple wire interwoven with the material of the garment or knitted into it. Alternatively, such a wire may be fixed onto, within or through the material of the garment. The conductor may itself be insulated or the insulation may be provided by the material of the garment.The number of electrodes may vary from two to four, but in certain applications greater numbers of electrodes are also advantageous.These may be interconnected into a network, but it is also possible to build up separate networks in the case of four or more electrodes . The configuration of the electrodes may be symmetrical relative to the bodily structure, but it may alternatively also be centred on one asymmetrically located part or organ of the body.Example IThe garment is designed as an abdominal belt 60 cm long, made wholly or partly of woven stretch fabric with a relatively high proportion of elastic and having an ultimate elongation of over 100 . The central part is provided with electrodes spaced apart 10 cm between centres in the longitudinal direction. Each electrode measures 2 cm in the long direction of the belt and 1 cm across. A press stud serves as a fastener. A further electrode measuring 1 x 1 cm has been fitted at 5 cm from both ends of the belt. Each terminal electrode is linked in galvanic contact to the near by central electrode through a number of interwoven insulated copper wires the electrodes also being made of copper .The abdominal belt is designed for a girth of 80 85 cm. It has been found that wearing of this belt had a beneficial effect on the posture of the wearer such as, for example, in cases of lordosis.Instead of copper another material such as brass or silver may be used. The electrodes can be glued to the fabric, incorporated into the texture or tacked onto the fabric by means of tiny holes in the metal. The conductor may be applied either on in the stretch fabric or in a non stretch part of the garment. The belt may also take the form of a waist belt that can be adjusted by means of a buckle. Example IIThe garment is a fully continuous band that can be pulled over the elbow. when applied, it shows a tangential elongation of about 50 . There are two electrodes on the inside of the elbow at the point which is known in acupuncture as large intestine 9, 10, 11 or the point known as triple heater 111 . Example IIIThe garment is designed as a long legged pantie hose. The first electrode is fitted just above the upper end of the perineum on the back side, and the second electrode on the lower point of attachment of the Achilles tendon of the other leg, whilst the uppermost electrode is connected to the other one s . The wearing of such a garment often brings relief in cases of excessive fluid being present in tissues, by stimulating the urge to secrete fluid.In like manner a vest, whether or not with sleeves, may be designed as a garment according to the invention. A sleeved vest can often be replaced by a shoulder piece, taking the form of a vest without body having one or two arm shoulder parts.
