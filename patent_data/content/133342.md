# A superlattice type semiconductor structure having a high carrier density.

## Abstract
The superlattice type semiconductor material has a multi layered structure on a substrate 1 , e.g. GaAs, and comprising first layers 4 of a semiconductor which alone contains impu rities and has a thickness less than the electron or hole wave length, alternating with second layers 5 of a semiconductor or insulator having such a thickness that electrons or holes may penetrate by tunneling. Electrons or holes distribute uni formly over the whole of the multilayered structure which be haves like a uniform semiconductor material. However, the carrier density may be made very high. Various examples of materials for the first and second layers 4, 5 and dopants for the first layers are disclosed. The individual layers may them selves be composite.
