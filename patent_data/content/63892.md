# Apparatus and method for conditioning a tobacco mass.

## Abstract
Dry, compacted masses of tobacco 46 are condi tioned by inserting an array of parallel perforated probes 72 into the mass and passing high pressure steam through the probes and probe perforations 90 into the tobacco mass as the probes are inserted and with drawn. The conditioning apparatus includes a frame 13 supporting a probe array and a ram 56 for moving the array toward and away from a tobacco mass supported by a conveyor 22. The probes are flexibly mounted to prevent bending, and extend through a stripper plate 140 which is supported from the array by way of a latching mechanism 146. The stripper plate holds the tobacco mass in place to prevent lifting of the mass upon withdrawal of the probes.
