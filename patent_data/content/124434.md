# Optically encoded information display apparatus with tampering indicator.

## Abstract
A display register for displaying information which may vary over time has optically readable code markings asso ciated with the display positions of the register. The optically readable code markings are, for example, bar codes which correspond to the value of the information being displayed by the register. In one version of the invention the bar codes are applied using visible ink adjacent to or over human perceiv able markings on the display register. A hand held laser scanning device is used to read the code markings. Alter natively, the bar codes are applied using an ultraviolet sen sitive ink which is otherwise invisible to the naked eye di rectly over the human perceivable markings on the register. The bar codes are then scanned using a UV laser device. In addition to encoding the variable information displayed by the display register, fixed information, such as the serial number of the display register, location, manufacturer, etc., can be encoded on the face of the register and scanned by the scanning device. The display register may also have an aux iliary display position which will display a code indicative of tampering with the display register. The invention finds par ticular utility in the remote reading of billing meters, such as those used to measure the consumption of water, natural gas, or electricity.
