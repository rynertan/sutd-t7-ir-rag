# Canceller trained echo suppressor.

## Abstract
An echo suppressor for a speech coder communication system comprises for each voice link in the system an echo suppressor circuit 11 having decision logic 28 to open or close suppressor switches 3, 14 and feature measure ments circuits 26, 29 monitoring the operation of the speech coder. A trainer 7 includes an adaptive echo can celler 33 , a circuit 38 for generating echo suppressor control coefficients, circuits 35, 36 for generating the res idue of its cancelling operation and a threshold circuit 37 for comparing said residue against a fixed threshold and for providing a signal of presence or lack of echo to the circuit 38 which adiusts its canceller coefficients in accordance with the signal feature measurements. The decision logic 28 utilizes the canceller coefficients and the signal feature measurements in making suppression determination.
