# Automatic verification.

## Abstract
A transaction involving a customer 5 , a retailer 6 and a bank 8 is carried out via a telecommunications link 7 . The identities of the participants are automatically verified utilising a first verification key ICf stored by the retailer and by the bank and a second verification key ICp supplied by the customer to the retailer and stored at the bank. In the verification process the retailer encrypts a message con sisting of or including a random element D1 with the first verification key and sends the encrypt D1 together with identifications of the retailer and the customer to the bank. The bank retrieves the two keys from its storage, deceypts, re encripts with the second key and returns this re crypt Ei to the retailer who uses the second verification key to con fim that the returned message corresponds to the original. A match proves that the correct keys were utilised and per mits the deduction that the participating parties were gen uine. References to retailer and bank indicate auto matic equipment operated by same.

## Description
SWTaM TIC VERIFICATI BT PATENT CASE 22963 This invention relates to an automatic verification process and especially to an automatic process for use to facilitate commercial transactions in which funds are transferred using a telecommunications network. A particularly important application of the invention concerns the automatic verification of information used in transactions involving transfer of funds via telecommunications networks. A typical transaction involves three parties namely 1 A customer 2 a retailer, and 3 the customer s bank, and verifying the identities of the parties is important, e.g. to prevent frauds and other criminal activities.Errors could also arise from mechanical malfunction, e.g.mis routing in the telecommunications network. It is an object of this invention to make fraud more difficult by increasing the probabilities of detection. The automatic verification process according to the invention utilises two verification keys, each available at first and second stations. The active station encrypts data, e.g. data consisting of or containing a random element with both keys, transmits one encript to the other station which decrypts and encrypts using the other key.The re crypt is returned to the active station and capared with the second encrypt. A match indicates that the two same keys were present at both stations. The comparison may also be achieved by decrypting the recrypt and comparing the decrypt with the data. It is desirable that the process is repeated twice, i.e. once with the first station active and once with the second station active. The automatic verification confirms that the correct keys were used. The use of secret keys, available only at the intended station, permits the deduction that the intended station participated. It is emçhasised that the method of verification does not expose or cczprcGi8e secret keys. It is expected that a station will include data storage means containing many secret keys each of which corresponds to one other station and is retrievable using the identity of that other station as address. The addresses may be exchanged cnenly. The retrieval of the correct keys confirms identity and the correctness of the keys is confirmed automatically by the method of the invention. The automatic verification process is particularly adapted to confirm the identity of the human customer Who provides 1 an address automatically read from a card which address therefore has the high accuracy associated with automatic readers 2 additional data which is subject to human error. Automatic verification may fail because of human error and it is desirable also to provide the human with a limited re try facility e.g. up to four attempts . In this case the first station has two keys as specified above but one is of higher accuracy i.e. automatically retrieved fran data storage and the other of lower accuracy i.e. affected by human input . It is preferred to transmit the encrypt from the key with higher accuracy to the second station together with addresses for the two keys. Decryption and re encryption are carried out with the accuracy associated with automatic processes and the re crypt returned to the first station is therefore accurate.Any discrepancy between the retained encrypt can be assigned to human error and retrials conducted without reference to the second location by storing the re crypt.The invention also includes apparatus for performing the method at 1 the first location 2 the second location. A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates a transaction Figure 2 illustrates the flow of information at the retailer s terminal, and Figure 3 illustrates the flow of information in the bank s data processing equipment. A typical transaction using the system includes the following events. A customer 5 approaches an interface 6 which is part of a retailer s terminal to complete a transaction by paying for cetain goods. The terminal contacts bank 8 via telecommunications link 7 in order to arrange transfer of funds from the customer 5 account to the retailer s account. It is apparent that all parties require assurance that the system is safe, e.g. that criminals are not able to obtain goods or funds to which they are not entitled. Some but not all individual requirements will be identified. The terminal needs to confirm that the customer 5 is genuine and also that the link 7 does in fact connect to the correct bank 8. Not only would mis routing in the telecommunication network lead to errors but, more seriously, criminal activity could result in loss. Thus the customer 5 could be a criminal conspiring with an accomplice who impersonates the bank so as to steal goods. Thus the terminal requires positive identification of both bank 8 and customer 5. The bank 8 requires proper identifications of terminal and customer 5 to safeguard against the stealing of funds by criminals impersonating the customer 5 and orthe terminal. In addition the bank has a duty of care to its various clients. The major concern of the customer 5 is that the system shall protect against criminal access to the customer s account. There is, therefore, a requirement for identification and this invention automatically carries out the identification process. As the primary means of identification each party has an identification code, conveniently abbreviated toIC. Since the purpose of an IC is to identify two parties to one another it must be knawn to both, but both parties must keep their crTwan IC secret from all other parties.Thus each terminal in the system may pair with any bank in the system and there is an IC for each pair this is conveniently known as the link IC because it is characteristic of the linked pair . Each of the bank s clients also has an IC code, which is retained in data storage means at the bank. Each client will also require a substantial amount of other data ta to operate the system and this is conventioaally recorded on a data card preferably as a magnetic strip . Since the card may be lost or stolen data ta recorded therein should not be regarded as secret and it conventional for each client to have, in addition, a personal identification number, conveniently abbreviated to PIN and the client s security depends on the PIN s being kept secret. A PIN is usually short, e.g. about four decimal digits, and therefore a plurality of clients will have the me PIN. Therefore, it is preferred to calculate a characteristic personal IC from the data on the card, and, optionally, the PIN. This promotes adequate security provided the client promptly notifies the bank if the card is lost or stolen and or if the PIN is compromised. A preferred automatic method of verifying IC s will now be described with reference to Figures 2 and 3. It isa particular feature of this method that it minimises the risk of compromising the various IC s and that it also minimises use of the telecommunications network. Tb start a transaction the customer s data card is placed in interface 6. The customer enters the secret PIN and a representative of the retailer enters information about the transaction, e.g. the amount to be transferred from the customer s account to the retailer s account. Interface 6 also reads the data card to identify the customer s bank, the customer s alleged identity and other information which may be required. Tb complete preliminaries the retailer s terminal uses the PIN and information on the card to calculate the personal IC of the customer. The terminal also accesses its own data storage means to retrieve the link IC appropriate for the customer s bank. The verification now proceeds in two phases. In phase one the retailer s terminal verifies customer and bank. In phase two the bank verifies the customer and retailer In phase one the terminal uses random number generator 10 to produce code D1 which is retained in store 11. Code Dl is encrypted twice, i.e. i D1 is encrypted using the alleged personal IC of the customer as key in cypher engine 12 to generate code D1 and ii D1 is also encrypted using the link IC as key in cypher engine 13 to generate code D1 . Code D1 is retained in store L5 and code D1 in store 14. The terminal now composes a contact message for the bank. This comprises the retailer s identity and the customer s alleged identity in clear and intelligible form together with code Dl . This message is automatically transmitted via modem 35 and link 7 to the bank. The bank receives this message on modem 36 and accesses its own data storage means, using addresses contained in themessage to retrieve the link IC apprcpriate to the terminal identified in the message and the personal IC of the alleged customer. The bank uses the link IC as key in cypher engine 18 to decrypt D1 into El. E1 should be the same as D1, but the system functions by verifying this circumstance.Different codes are used to emphasise that identity is not necessary, e.g. if fraud were attempted. It also re çrsnrypts El is cypher engine 20 using the personal IC as key. This process code El which is retained in store 21. This is automatically transmitted to the retailer s terminal via modem 36, link 7 and modem 35 which places code El0 in store 17. Comparator 16 caries the content of stores 15 and 17. A match indicates 1 that Dl was decrypted by the correct link IC as key. This establishes, with reasonable probability, that link 7 was to the correct bank because only the correct bank has knowledge of the link IC 2 that El was enrypted using the same key as the personal IC entered in interface. This establishes that the customer s alleged IC is the same as that in the bank s record and hence that the customer is genuine. If the match fails it is assumed that the customer made an error and re entry of the PIN is attempted. Since store 17 still contains E10 a re match can be carried out without using link 7 to refer to the bank. Several attempts, e.g. four, at matching are allowed. If all fail the transaction is aborted but success establishes that the customer is genuine and allows phase two to commence. As an alternative the customer may first enter the PIN at this stage. In phase two the retailer s terminal composes a transaction message requesting the bank to transfer funds. Clear and intelligible identification of the customer and the retailer are included. On receipt ofthis message the bank satisfies itself that the retailer and customer are genuine by repeating the identification procedure. This repetition is started by the bank which uses random number generator 22 to produce code D2 which is retained in store 23. Code D2 is encrypted twice, namely,D2 is encrypted in cypher engine 25 using the link IC as key giving code D2 in store 26 and D2 is also encrypted in cypher engine 24 using the personal IC from its own records as key giving code D2 in store 27. Code D2 is sent, via link 7, to the retailer s terminal where it is decoded in cypher engine 30 to give the code E2 in store 31. Re encryption in cypher engine 32, using the personal IC from interface 6 verified by the terminal during phase one as key gives code E20 in store 33. Link 7 is used again to send code E2 to store 29 where it is comPared with the content of store 27 in comparator 28. A match is taken as proof, for the bank,that the request canes fram a genuine customer and a genuine retailer. To save usage of link 7 the sendings of El and D2 fran bank to terminal are preferably combined in the same signal. When the bank is satisfied with identifications it accepts the transaction message and acts upon it.Preferably it returns a record of what it has done to the retailer. Terminal 6 preferably makes a hard copy of the transaction far the customer. The originators of the messages passed by the system are authenticated by the secret ICs of the participants. It is important that these be kept private. The security can be erhwsxoed by changing the ICs at suitable intervals. The e system never passes ICs around the telecommunications network in intelligible for.Verification is achieved by passing randam mwiberss encrypted by ICs so the IC cannot be revealed.In addition, the usage of the telexxllmunication network is minimised because the system limits usage to short messages and links need not be kept open While slow procedures are performed. The preferred method is encryption used the IzS algorithm as described in FIPS 64 as published by the U.S. Government. It is noted that all messages passing over link 7 may need to be protected against illicit modification during transmission. This may be guaranteed by appesbding a special data block at the end of each message as it is sent. This block is conventionally termed the message authentication code, and is formed by using the link IC as a key to encrypt data zilch is a function of every bit of the message to be protected. If the message and its authentication cade still tally at its destination then the message can not have been modified in transit. It is convenient to arrange the first and second station with only one cypher engine each. The cypher engine at each end station handles all the cryptography at that station. It is emphasised that the methods disclosed herein are automatic methods carried out electronically.Reference to Code , Key , Data and Information should be construed as representations suitable for automatic processing. Different forms of representation are appropriate in different parts of the method, eg electromagnetic or electrical pulses during transmission, magnetisation in storage and voltages or currents to actuate processing elements.
