## Description
TITTLE STORAGE OF COMPONENTS OF CHEMILUMINESCENT LIGHTING SYSTEMSField of the Invention This invention relates to chemiluminescent compositions and to a method and packaging material for improving the storage stability of chemiluminescent components.Background of the Intention Chemiluminescence is obtained when certain chemiluminescent compounds, for instance oxalic type compounds, such as oxalic acid esters, are contacted in the presence of a fluorescer with a hydrogen peroxide compound. Such a system is described in U.S. Patent 3,597,362, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Packaged chemiluminescent light devices which utilize these chemiluminescent systems are described in U.S. Patents 3,511,612 and 3,576,987. A typical chemiluminescent device comprises a lightstick, i.e.a transparent or translucent flexible plastic outer tube of polyethylene or the like and within the outer tube a frangible glass inner tube. The inner tube is filled with one component of a two component system usually the hydroperoxide component and the outer plastic tube is filled with the other component oxalate plus fluorescer . To operate the device, the outer flexible tube is bent, thereby breaking the glass tube to mix the two components within the transparent outer tube.Reaction of the mixture produces chemiluminescence and the tube transmits the lights. In order for a chemiluminescent system to be practical it must be capable of storage for reasonable storage periods at temperatures above normal room temperature, for example, up to about 400C, and in humid atmosphere, without undue deterioration, which would cause loss of light generating capacity when the system is activated for use. In the systems described, the chemiluminescent component, for example, the oxalic acid ester, is subject to deterioration by light, heat, and humidity. Polyethylene has been the packaging material of choice for containing the oxalate component because of its low cost, ease of fabrication, and translucence. However, the polyethylene tube must be protected from moisture and light by enclosing it in an aluminum foil envelope during storage, since polyethylene is not impervious to moisture. Since the hydroperoxide component would be sensitive to storage in polyethylene, deteriorating rapidly on storage therein even at ordinary room temperature, it is preferred to contain the hydroperoxide component in the sealed inner glass vial which floats in the fluid contents of the polyethylene outer tube. Aluminum foil is a satisfactory wrapper for containing the polyethylene tube in storage, provided the wrapper does not develop any leakage by ruptures, pin holes or the like. There is some difficulty in sealing an aluminum foil wrapper to make it totally impervious to moisture. Rauhut, in U S. Patent 3,974,368, disclosed a chlorosilane passivization treatment for glass or plastic container materials, the object of which is to make the material more suitable for storage of the oxalic acid ester component. While this treatment was shown to be effective, it is costly and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need for a mterial in which the chemiluminescent components are protected from deterioration during storage.Summary of the Invention The present invention employs packaging material for containing one or several of the liquid components in a chemiluminescent device. This material is a laminate of aluminum foil and polypropylene film, bonded togetherpm√®rablyby means of a low molecular weight polypropylene adhesive. Description of the Invention Diaryl and dialkyl oxalates, substituted with strong electronegative groups, may be used as the chemiluminescent component, as described in U.S. Patent 3,597,362.In general, the greatest light output is expected with the oxalates derived from phenols or alcohols having a pKa value lower than 7.0. Examples include bis 4 nitrophenyl oxalate bis 6 carbopentoxy 2,3,5 trichlorophenyl oxalate bis 2, 4 dinitrophenyl oxalate, and the like. The same fluorescers disclosed for use with oxalatehydroperoxide systems in U.S. Patents 3,597,362 and 3,557,233 are useful in the present invention. Examples include 9,10 diphenylanthracene blue emission 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene yellow green l chloro 9, 10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene yellow green 2 chloro 9,10 bis phenylethyny anthracene yellow 1,5 dichloro 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene yellow 1,8 dichloro 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene yellow 5,12 bis phenylethynyl naphthacene red rubrene orange , and the like. Suitable organic solvents for example, dibutyl phthalate and rate regulating catalysts are described inU.S. Patent 3,576,987, Each of the several liquid components of a chemiluminescent system of the kind described can be effectively stored in a container of the laminate material of the invention. The laminate is an aluminum foil bonded to a cast polypropylene film. Suitably the polypropylene film has a thickness of about 0.5 to 4 mils, and contains a food grade antioxidant additive. The bonding adhesive for the laminate preferably is a low molecular weight polypropylene.A suitable laminate is available from American Can Co. under the Trade name Maraflex 7F At least one of the chemilumin excent components is stered in a container made of the laminate with the contents in contact with the polypropylene surface of the laminate material. The laminate is not suitable for use as a maternal for the outer container of a lighting device, because it cannot transmit chemiluminescence. The laminate is nonetheless useful as a storage container for one or several of the liquid chemiluminescent components in a chemilumine scent device to protect the contents from light, air and moisture. A package made of the laminate material can be used in lighting devices of diverse shapes and designs, provided that the construction of the lighting device comprises means to rupture the laminate package and allow the contents thereof to mix and react to produce chemiluminescence within a translucent outer container. Devices of this kind were described for example in U.S Patent 3,539,794 patented November 10, 1970. It has been discovered, quite unexpectedly, that the hydroperoxide component, which is not stable in polyethylene, will be quite stable when stored in a container made of the laminate material of the invention, with the polypropylene layer inside the container contacting the hydroperoxide. The following examples illustrate the invention.Preparation of Samples Pouches were prepared using Maraflex 7F laminate American Can Co. Several of the pouches were charged with 0.15 molar bis 6 carbopentoxy 2,3,5 trichlorophenyl oxalate and 0.009 molar l chloro 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene in dibutyl phthalate solvent, and the pouches were sealed. Similarly, several pouches were charged with 1.50 mol aqueous 90 hydrogen peroxide solution and 2.0 x 1G 3 molar sodium salicylate in a solvent consisting of 80 by volume of dimethyl phthalate and 20 by volume of t butyl alcohol and sealed. The sealed pouches with the contents described were stored at room temperature and at 400C for 1, 3 and 6 months before testing. Control samples were prepared similarly and tested immediately. Testing Procedure Measured amounts of the oxalate component and activator component prepared as described, were tested when freshly made and after storage for measured periods in the pouches described. The components were mixed and light intensity values were measured every two minutes in a monochromatorphotomultiplier light measuring instrument. The measurements were transmitted to computer programmed to calculate the time intensity and other values shown in theTables. The computer program yields time intensity readings for each sample, in both lumens liter and in einsteins sec ml, along with light capacity, TO.75 and Quantum yield.Calibration for absolute light intensities were carried out using the spectroradiometerluminometer developed byB.G. Roberts and R.C. Hirt, Applied Spectroscopy 21,250 1967 .Results Results of the testing procedure for samples 1 12 are given in Table I.

The results in Table I demonstrate that neither the performance of the oxalate ester components nor that of the hydrogen peroxide component, with regard to light production, has been essentially changed when those components have been separately stored in sealed containers made with the laminate of this invention for periods up to three months at temperatures at least as high as 400C.The loss in storage for six months is remarkably small under the circumstances.
