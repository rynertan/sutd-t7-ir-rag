# Four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
A mechanical four wheel drive tractor has a solenoid valve 24 which is de energised to select engagement of drive to the front wheels. Normally the valve 24 is control led by an operator switch 25 but, when the engine is over loaded and exhaust gas temperature rises, a thermal sen sor 32 breaks the circuit to a relay 31 shown energised and relay contacts 30 break the circuit to the solenoid valve 24 so that four wheel drive is automatically engaged. This action is restricted to a low gear range by a switch 29 linked to the mechanism selecting between the low range I and a high range II . Automatic engagement of four wheel drive reduces the overload on the transmission. The action is restricted to the low range I because overloading can occur only in that range and in order to avoid unexpect ed engagement in the higher range II used for road travel ling.
