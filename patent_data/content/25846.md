# Improved process for the preparation of vinylcyclopropane derivatives.

## Abstract
This invention provides a convenient and commercially adaptable process for the preparation of vinylcyclopropane derivatives in high yields. The process involves reacting an alkylating agent and an activated methylene compound in the presence of an onium compound, an alkali metal compound and water, which while only necessary in trace amounts can be present in substantial quantities.
