# Polyolefin composition.

## Abstract
Apolyolefin composition is disclosed, which comprises a polyolefin and an inorganic filler, wherein the polyolefin compo sition comprising A 75 to 97 by weight of a polyolefin com ponent comprising a 90 to 65 parts by weight of an ethylene propylene copolymer having an ethylene content of not more than 7 by weight and or polypropylene and b 10 to 35 parts by weight of a polyethylene having a melt index of not lower than 10 g min., said melt index being from 1.0 to 50 times that of the polymer a , and B 25 to 3 by weight of a fibery inor ganic filler having an average fiber diameter of 0.1 to 2 mi crometers and an aspect ratio of 20 to 60. The polyolefin composition is capable of providing, upon molding, articles having good surface appearance, in particular glossiness and improved mechanical strengths with less warp ing and deformation.
