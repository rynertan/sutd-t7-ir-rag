# Strap feeding and tensioning assembly.

## Abstract
Strap feeding and tensioning apparatus is provided for use in a strapping machine to feed steel or plastic strapping in a loop around an object to be strapped and tension the strap loop about the object, providing maximum gripping force on the strap and minimum marring thereof. The apparatus includes a motor driven drive wheel 40 geared to a feed wheel 70 , the drive wheel 40 and feed wheel 70 respectively having circumferential strap engaging surfaces which cooperate frictionally to grip the strapping therebetween and move the strapping in a tensioning direction in response to rotation of the drive wheel 40 . The axis of rotation of the feed wheel 70 is shiftable about a fixed axis to accommodate movement of the feed wheel 70 toward and away from the drive wheel 40 , tensioning of the associated strap 11 exerting a resultant force on the feed wheel 70 tending to effect movement thereof about the fixed axis in a direction to increase the frictional gripping force exerted on the associated strap 11 by the feed wheel 70 and the drive wheel 40 .
