# Precision medication dispensing system.

## Abstract
A precision medication dispensing system comprising an implantable device 10 . The device includes a medication res ervoir 12 , a pulsatile pump 24 and an absolute pressure transducer 70 . The pumping pressure wave developed in the pumping chamber 60 is measured by the absolute pressure transducer 70 whose output is used to adjust the pulsing rate of the solenoid operated pump 24 so that the programmed time averaged rate of infusion of medication into the body is precisely maintained throughout all operating temperature and pressure conditions.
