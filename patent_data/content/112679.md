# Process for the preparation of esters or salts of aromatic or etheroaromatic acids.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of esters or salts of aromatic or etheroaromatic acids of formula Y Ar CO OR I , where Ar represents an aromatic group constituted by one or more benzene rings, optionally condensed, or an etheroaromatic nuc leus optionally condensed with one or more benzene rings Y represents zero, one or more of certain defined sub stituents including halogen , which substituents may be the same or different and R represents an alkyl group R₁ having up to 5 carbon atoms or an alkaly metal or alkaline earth metal M. These esters and salts I are obtained by reaction of a halide of formula Y Ar X II where Ar and Y have the defined meanings and where X is Cl, Br or I, with carbon monoxide, in an alcoholic solvent R₁OH at atmospheric pressure and at a tem perature from 10 to 60 C in the presence of an acidity acceptor compound and of a catalyst constituted by a cobalt complex of formula III Z Co CO ₄ III where Z has certain defined meanings. The corresponding aromatic or etheroaromatic acids can be obtained by further treatment of the esters and salts thus ob tained, by following known procedures.
