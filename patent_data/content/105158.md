# CUSTOMIZATION WINDOW FOR A COMPUTER NUMERICAL CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A bidirectional communications link, termed a customi zation window, comprises a series of routines including functions, procedures and status flags implemented in soft ware, interfaced between a machine control logic MCL operating to control the auxiliary functions of a computer ized numerical control CNC system and a numerical con trol NC operating to control the multi axis motions of the system whereby the MCL, implemented in software, can ac cess the NC, also implemented in software, and control the system but only under conditions dictated by the NC and en forced by the routines of the customization window so that, for example, the integrity of the NC software will not be compromised by any of the MCL software which is of a user programmabie type. Additionally, machine setup data and the availability of optional system control features are rou ted from the NC to the MCL through the customization win dow. Also the customization window conveys the status of the various operational conditions of the NC to the MCL.
