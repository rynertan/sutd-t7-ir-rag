# Combine harvester with removable threshing and separating unit.

## Abstract
A combine harvester 1 in which an axial flow threshing and separating unit 10 is carried transversely of the harvester 1 by a support structure 9 which is fixed releasably to the cutting table 6 of the harvester 1 . This construction enables the combine harvester 1 to be dis mantled into three main units the cutting table 6 , the threshing and separating unit 10 with its support structure 9 , and a rear part of the harvester 1 so as to simplify considerably the assembly, disassembly and transportation of the harvester 1 .
