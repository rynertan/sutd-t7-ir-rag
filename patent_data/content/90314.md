# PCM ENCODER CONFORMABLE TO THE A LAW

## Abstract
In a PCM encoder, in order to reduce noise in an idle channel or in the absence of any voice signal by converting, in effect, them into low frequency signals, a circuit 901 is provided which detects the idle channel, and a circuit 904 which fixes the polarity bit of a PCM signal produced by the PCM encoder, when the detector circuit has detected the idle channel.
