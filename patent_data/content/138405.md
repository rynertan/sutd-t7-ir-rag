# Coin controlled lock.

## Abstract
A coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation has a coin chute 15 through which one or more coins of the same denomination must pass. The check for minimum diameter is made by insertion of a tapered finger 18 between the edge of the coin, or of a number of abutting coins, and the edge of the chute 15 . If the bolt 2 is allowed to operate, the coin or coins are allowed to drop only when a groove in the bolt 2 aligns with the chute 15 . The chute defines the number and size of coins to be used and is inter changeable to allow rapid modification of the mechanism to operate in a different mode. The mass of a coin is checked by requiring the coin to deflect a spring member 17 .

## Description
Coin Controlled LockThis invention relates to coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for use in security lockers or cabinets which provide a secure repository available, for example, to patrons of swimming pools and leisure centres.In some circumstances security lockers are provided as a facility, free to the patron, in which case the coin inserted is, in effect a deposit upon the return of the key and when the key is again made captive in the lock, by the unlocking action, then the coin is returned to the patron. In other circumstances the lockers are available as a secure repository to be hired temporarily by the patron, and in this case the coin or coins inserted are in payment of the hire fee and are transferred to a cash box when the locker is locked.Here again the key is held captive in the lock when he locker is unlocked.Lock mechanisms are sometimes mounted on the door of the locker or cabinet and sometimes in the vertical post of the door frame. It is an advantage if a bank of lockers can be served by a common cash box. Some lock mechanisms are aranged for single coin operation others are arranged for multiple coin operation.A lock mechanism accepting a single coin is disclosed in Patent Specification Mumber 1,093,600, and a mechanism accepting two coins is disclosed in PatentApplication Number 2,004,400 A.A lock mechanism of the type described above should preferably be capable of being simply and readily adjusted to be operable by coins of 2p or 5p or lOp or 20p or 50p denominations in both the single coin and two coin requirement it is the object of this present invention to provide such a mechanism. It is assumed that where multiple coins are used, they are to be of the same denomination. Checking of coins of different denominations is more complex and not envisaged in the present instance.A lock mechanism of the type above should ensure that the lock is rendered operable only when the requisite coin or coins have been inserted. If the coin or disc inserted is of the correct diameter it is considered to be the requisite coin.Thus three checks are necessary 1. Is the coin too large in diameter 2. Is the coin too small in diameter 3. Is there a coin present in the mechanism Checks 1 and 2 are effected by diameter gauges or gates and are easily arranged. At the entrance slot in which the coin is inserted there is a fixed gate of such a size that an oversize coin cannot be inserted.Within the mechanism there is an exit gate of such a size that a coin of the correct size is retained but an undersize coin passes through the gate and is not retained in the mechanism to take part in any operation of the lock.Check 3 is performed in the earlier of the two patent specifications referred to above by a sensing finger which bears upon the face of the retained coin. If there is a coin present, it must be of the correct size, and the lock mechanism can be operated if the coin is not present the movement of the sensing finger is not obstructed and because of this the lock mechanism is rendered inoperable.In a mechanism arranged for two coin operation six checks are necessary 1. Is the first coin too large in diameter 2. Is the second coin too large in diameter 3. Is the first coin too small in diameter 4. Is the second coin too small in diameter 5. Is the first coin present 6. Is the second coin present In the latter patent specification referred to above the checks 1 and 2 are effected by the entrance gate as described above.Check 5 does not need to be carried out separately, since if check 6 is positive the first coin must be present to support the second.Check number 3 is effected by the exit gate also as described above, but if the first coin is of correct size and is retained by the exit gate then the second coin cannot be subjected to the diameter check number 4 by the exit gate. Instead the two checks numbers 4 and 6 have been combined by so arranging the two coins in the coin chute or channel that the sensing finger bears upon the face of a correct second coin at a point so close to the periphery that an undersize second coin would offer no obstruction to the downward movement of the sensing finger whereby the mechanism would be rendered inoperable. The difference in coin diameter to be detected by this means is sometimes quite small. For example the lp coin is about 1.14 mm. smaller in diameter than the 20p coin which has a septagonal periphery.It has yet to be shown commercially that a sensing finger applied to the coin face can distinguish between these two coins.The aims of the invention are to provide a reliable but inexpensive coin controlled lock mechanism. It should nevertheless be versatile, so that by simple modification, its function can be adapted to new conditions.According to a first feature of the invention, there is provided a coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation having a coin chute through which one or more coins must pass, wherein at least part of a wall of said chute is formed by one face of a member movable in response to rotation of a key, said face including a recess which when positioned to form said wall allows a coin of specified diameter to pass through the chute, while in another position of the member that coin will not pass through. Preferably, the movable member is the bolt which effects actual locking. The dual function of the bolt reduces the number of functional parts and consequently the cost.The recess may be a groove having the width of the specified coin. According to a second feature of the invention, there is provided a coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation and having a coin chute through which one or more coins must pa ss to to permit operation, wherein a check for the minimum permissable diameter of a coin is made with a coin held in the chute, said mechanism comprising a sensor finger movable in a direction generally transverse to the chute at one edge thereof and at a position such that to permit operation of the mechanism the finger must not pass fully into the space between the held coin and said one edge. The finger is preferably tapered at its leading end, so that the degree to which it can penetrate any gap between the coin and the edge of the chute is a very sensitive indication of the diameter of the coin. According to a third feature of the invention, there is provided a coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation and having a coin chute through which one or more coins must pass to permit operation, wherein the walls defining said chute are formed at least in part by a control member which may be provided with various effective surface configurations, whereby the movement or retention of a coin or coins in the chute, and the mode of operation of the mechanism, is varied. Preferably, the control member is removable, allowing rapid interchange so as to adjust the mode of operation, e.g. to change the hire charge. Moreover, since only the control member needs to be altered, the remainder of the mechanism remaining identical, mass production of a variety of different locks becomes cheaper.According to a fourth feature of the invention there is provided a coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation and having a coin chute through which a plurality of coins of the same denomination must pass to permit operation, wherein a check for oversize coins is performed individually by a gate, and a check is performed in the chute for the presence of an undersize coin by checking the combined length across their diameter of a plurality of abutting coins.Preferably the plurality of coins are brought to lie between two horizontally spaced limit surfaces the spacing of which is exactly filled by the presence of the correct coins. The mechanism then tests whether a sensor finger can be inserted into the space in addition. If it can, the operation of the lock is inhibited.According to a final feature of the invention, there is provided a coin controlled lock mechanism suitable for a locker installation and having a coin chute through which one or more coins must pass to permit operation, wherein checks are made for maximum and minimum diameter of coins inserted, and wherein the mass of each coin is checked by causing the coin to pass a spring abutment which obstructs the chute, only coins of a minimum mass passing the abutment. Preferably the abutment is a leaf spring which projects at an acute angle into the chute, generally in the direction of movement of coins therein. This is a simple way of avoiding operation of the lock e.g. by a disc of cardboard, and is cheaper to arrange than a more conventional weighing and tipping mechanism.These various features of the invention may be used separately, or may be combined to produce a simple, versatile and cheap lock, which is easy to maintain and easy to modify for changed circumstances.To illustrate the invention various exemplary embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanyig drawings in which Figure 1 is the patron s view of the lock mechanism mounted in the vertical post of the door frame of a locker Figure 2 shows the general arrangement of the principal elements of the mechanism from the rear Figure 3 is a cross section on the line AA in Figure 2 Figure 4 shows a perspective view of one example of a control bar Figure 5 shows the bolt and its operation Figs. 6,7 and 8 three stages in the passage of two 20p coins through the mechanism to a cash box Figs. 9,10 and 11 show three stages in the passage of a single 20p coin which is refunded to the patron, the positions of the bolt at each stage being also illustrated and Figure.12 shows a further embodiment of a mechanism for receiving three or more coins.In Figure 1 the lock mechanism 1 is shown mounted in the vertical post of a locker door frame and in broken line is shown the bolt 2 in the locked position. The mechanism is operated by the rotation of the key in the lock 3 which can be rotated from the unlocked to the locked position after the requisite coin or coins have been inserted in the upper coin slot 4.If the coin is to be refunded to the patron, the coin issues from the lower coin slot 5, after the lock has been rotated to the unlocked position and the key rendered captive in the lock.The principal elements of the mechanism are disposed as shown in Figures 2 and 3 in which ths frame 6 provides for the mounting of the lock 3, for the pivoted location of the bolts 2 and of the pawl 8 and for the accomodation of the control bar 9.The lock 3 is so arranged that the rotation of the key 10 imparts an equal rotation to the sleeve 11 which is rotatably mounted upon the barrel of the lock. Fixed to the sleeve 11 is the arm 12 and the cam 13. The cam 13 co operates with the pawl 8 and, as is shown more clearly in Figure 5, the arm 12 transmits motion to the bolt. There is a groove 20 in the face of the bolt and this groove connects at one end with an area 21 which has the same depth from the face of the bolt as the groove 20. This area connects with a deeper groove 22 which becomes coincident with the edge of a coin in the control bar when the bolt is in the fully withdrawn and unlocked position.These grooves is provided for the movement of the coin or coins in the control bar, from one position to another in the operation of the lock as described below. The movement of a coin from one position to another is, in every case, a movement induced by the force of gravity, and is therefore always downward through the mechanism.Reverting to Figure 2, the pawl 8 is pivotally mounted on the pivot pin 19, and slides upon the face of the bolt 2. The pawl is constrained by the spring 7 to bear on the periphery of the cam 13.The pawl has a feeler blade extension 18 which is bevelled on the edge 22 to enable the blade readily to enter such space as may exist between the surface of the bolt and the periphery of a coin, in the control bar, detained in the position for check inspection.When the cam is rotated in the direction of the arrow the consequent movement of the pawl causes the feeler blade 18 to enter the coin space provided in the control bar. If there is no coin present, or if the coin present is under size, the pawl follows the cam to the lowest point of the periphery where the face 23 of the pawl abuts the face 24 of the cam and further rotation of the cam is prevented. If a coin of the correct size is present, there is not sufficient space between the periphery of the coin and the face of the bolt for the feeler blade to enter and the motion of the pawl is arrested before the lowest point of the cam periphery is reached. The point at which the motion is arrested is such that the face 23 of the pawl and the face 24 of the cam do not abut so that the rotation of the cam can continue.Such continued rotation of the cam lifts the pawl and retracts the feeler blade from the coin space in the control bar. The control bar 9 shown in Figure 4 is accomodated in the space 14 between the edge flange of the frame and the adjacent partition as shown in Figures 2 and 3 in which Figure 3 shows the juxaposition of the bolt 2, and the control bar 9, and the feeler blade extension of the pawl 8. When the control bar is in position in the mechanism the aperture D in Figure 4 is positioned to accept coins inserted in the upper coin slot 4 inFigure 2.When the requisite coin or coins are inserted in the upper coin slot 4 they pass into a suitably formed channel or coin chute 15 formed largely in the control bar as will be seen in Figures 2 and 4. Over a portion of its length, the chute 15 has one edge wall formed by the surface of the bolt 2. The insertion of an oversize coin is prevented by an entrance gate formed by a pin in hole 16 which is so positioned that the distance D is greater than the diameter of the requisite coin but smaller than the diameter of the next larger coin. In passing down the chute 15 an edge of each inserted coin passes across the surface of the bolt. In the single coin mode, which will now be described, an inserted coin of the correct size, is detained at the exit gate formed by a pin in hole 17. The pin 17 is so positioned that an undersize coin passes through the gate and out of the mechanism whilst a correct size coin is detained in the gate between the pin in hole 17 and the surface of the bolt.When the key 10 is turned to lock the cabinet the feeler blade extension 18 of the pawl 8 checks the presence of the coin, and, if the coin is present, the inward motion of the pawl, permitted by the cam, is arrested so that the key can continue to be turned to the fully locked condition. When this condition is reached, and the bolt is fully extended, the groove 20, provided in the surface of the bolt, is cotincident with the edge of the coin. The depth of the groove 20 from the surface of the bolt is such that the distance between the bottom of the groove and the gating pin in hole 17 is greater than the diameter of the coin which is therefore no longer retained and passes down the chute 15 in the control bar 9 and out of the mechanism into the cash box below.In the above mode or sequence of operations a single coin of a given denomination freed the mechanism and was transferred to the cash box. This mode was prescribed by the control bar shown in Figure 4. The exchange of this control bar for the one shown inFigure 6 would prescribe a different mode wherein the mechanism would be rendered operable by the insertion of two 20p coins which would then be transferred to the cash box.The two coin mode requires the application of an additional check, namely, a minimum diameter check on the second coin. The first coin is checked for maximum and minimum diameter by the entrance and exit gates, in the manner previously described for the single coin mode, but the second coin is not checked for the minimum diameter by the exit gate because the first coin is already in the exit gate and retained thereby as shown in Figure 6 in which 9 is the control bar, 2 is the bolt in section and 25 is the pin which, in conjunction with the surfce of the bolt, forms the exit gate. The minimum diameter check on the second coin is carried out by the feeler blade 18 as previously described and as shown in Figure 7. If the second coin is undersize, as shown in broken line, the movement of the feeler blade is not obstructed and the mechanism is thereby rendered inoperative. If the second coin is of the correct diameter the feeler blade is withdrawn and the operation of the mechanism is continued until the bolt is fully extended and the cabinet is locked.With the bolt fully extended the groove 20 in the face of the bolt 2 in Figure 5, coincides with the edges of both coins and, by virtue of the increased space made available by the groove in the bolt, the coins pass through the exit gate and into the cash box below.It will be noted that in the two coin mode the dual function of the feeler blade in checking both the diameter and the presence of the second coin is essential to the correct operation of the mechanism whereas, in the single coin mode, the essential check is for the presence of the coin only, as the diameter check is effected by the exit gate.Figures 9,10 and 11 show three stages in the passage, through the chute, of a 20p coin which is refunded to the patron. In those modes where the coin is refunded to the patron, the return of the coin is made when the mechanism is fully unlocked and the key is captive in the lock. It will be seen that the width of the channel narrows slightly on the way down between pins 26 and 27.In a first stage, shown in Figure 9, a coin of the correct size has been inserted and is retained at the exit gate between the pin 26 and the face of the bolt 2. The edge of the coin is in contact with the surface of the bolt at the point A shown in the upper view.The rotation of the key to the locked poistion moves the bolt until the groove 20 is coincident with the edge of the coin as shown in Figure 10, upper view, where the point of edge contact between the coin and the surface of the bolt has moved from A to B. The increased space provided by the depth of the groove 20 permits the coin to pass the pin 26, as shown in broken line and to proceed along the chute until it is obstructed at the narrower point formed by the second pin 27 as shown in full line. Here the point of edge contact between the coin and the bottom of the groove has moved from B to C as shown in the upper viewFigure 10.When the mechanism is unlocked Fig.ll , and the bolt fully withdrawn, the deeper groove 21 is brought coincident with the edge of the coin and the point of edge contact of the coin is moved from C to D as shown in the upper view Figure 11. The increased space provided by the deeper groove permits the coin to pass the pin 27, as shown in broken line, and to proceed to the final position, shown in full line, to the coin return slot 5 where it is available to the patron.Fig 12 illustrates another embodiment of a control bar designed to provide a further mode of operation, namely operation by three coins of the same denomination, the hire fee being retained. The basic elements illustrated are as in previous embodiments, although the control bar 9 is illustrated reversed side to side compared with earlier figures. The aperture D defines the maximum size of a coin which is accepted, and the bolt 12 defines with the rear wall 30 an initial retention position for the first coin 31 inserted. However in this case the chute is given a serpentine configuration. This is to enable the minimum diameter check to be made on the second and third coins.The position of three coins after insertion is shown in full lines at 31,32 and 33. Provided coins 32 and 33 are both of the correct diameter, the space between points 34 and 35 equal to twice the diameter is completely filled. The sensing of this fact by the feeler blade extension 18 not illustrated in this figure is carried out as before. If either of the two coins is undersize, the cam 13 will be locked as in other embodiments.This technique of sensing the total diameter of two coins held edge to edge, in order to detect the presence of an undersize coin, can also be applied to three or more coins, and could be used in other mechanisms. The coins do not have to lie in a horizontal line.This embodiment also includes a feature designed to foil operation of the mechanism by discs having the correct diameter, but of incorrect weight e.g. made of plastics or card. A curved leaf spring 38 is fixed at one end 39 and at its free end 40 obstructs one side of the chute which because of this at that point has a dimension less than the diameter of a correct coin. The shape and strength of the spring 38 and the amount of its projection are chosen such that a coin or token of the correct weight will have sufficient kinetic energy on dropping through the chute to displace the spring a lighter disc would be unable to do this and would lodge on the spring. This spring arrangement is applicable to the other embodiments described earlier, and indeed can be used in other lock mechanisms altogether. Any suitable spring loaded member might also be used, but the single leaf spring is extremely cheap to make and assemble.
