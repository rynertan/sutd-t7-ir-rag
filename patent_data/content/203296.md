## Description
The invention relates to a liquid coating composition based on a compound having at least 2 acryloyl groups or methacryloyl groups and an amino compound having at least one primary amino group which is blocked with an aldehyde or ketone containing not more than 10 carbon atoms. A composition of the above type, which is curable under the influence of moisture at ambient temperature, is known from European Patent Application No. 40 288. As amino compound an amino groups containing vinyl addition polymer is used, which as a result of the complicated and time consuming method of preparation often leads to obtaining coloured products. This is objectionable in the case of uses where the absence of colour is of essential importance, as in the case of non pigmented toplayers in a two layer metallics system. The invention provides a coating composition of which the constituents are rapid and relatively simple to prepare and do not or hardly lead to coloured products. The coating composition to the invention is characterized in that the amino compound is an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine containing 2 24 carbon atoms or an adduct of a molecular weight of 300 1500 of an epoxy compound or isocyanate compound or α β ethylenically unsaturated carbonyl compound and an amino compound having at least 1 primary amino group and a group reacting with the epoxy compound or isocyanate compound or α, β ethylenically unsaturated carbonyl compound.
