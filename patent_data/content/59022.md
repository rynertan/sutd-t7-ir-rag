# Plastic ski boot adapted to be releasably attached to a ski.

## Abstract
The boot has an attachment member 15 mounted on its lower 12 between the toe 16 and heel 17 , is adapted to be releasably attached to a ski 22 . The toe 16 and heel 17 portions of the boot are shaped to facilitate safe and comfort able walking and standing, and at least part of the sole walking surfaces 13 are covered with a high friction plastic for walking purposes. The forward lean angle of the boot when out of the binding can be lesser than normal to provide comfortable standing and walking, and the ski binding 20 with which the boot 10 is adapted to cooperate adds sufficient forward lean angle for skiing purposes when the boot is in the binding.
