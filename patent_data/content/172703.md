# Production of ammonia synthesis gas.

## Abstract
A process for removal of excess nitrogen and carbon oxides from a raw synthesis gas used to make ammonia. The raw synthesis gas is divided into two portions. The first portion is methanated to remove carbon oxides and then cooled to condense part of its nitrogen content. The conde nsed nitrogen is fed to the top of a nitrogen wash column. The second portion of the raw synthesis gas is passed over an absorbent which removes carbon dioxide and water vapor. It is then cooled to condense excess nitrogen. The remaining gas is fed to the bottom of an nitrogen wash column where it is washed free of carbon monoxide by the nitrogen condensed from the methanated gas stream.
