## Description
The present invention relates to apparatus employed to monitor EKG information, and more particu larly relates to a programmable apparatus carried by an ambulatory patient for performing continuous, real time analyses of EKG information derived from the patient, for determining the existence of various conditions based on these analyses which portend cardiac complica tions including myocardial ischemia, and arrhythemia activity and for instructing the patient on the manner of treatment required for the detected condition. The leading cause of death in adults in the U.S.A. is coronary artery disease yet the disease re mains silent or dormant in the majority of patients until the fourth or fifth decade of life. Then, coro nary artery disease typically moves from the silent phase to a symptomatic phase, at which time the patient may experience as the first symtoms, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and or sudden death. The prevalence of coronary artery disease in the United States has been estimated at over 4,000,000 persons. Over 1,000,000 are expected to have myocardial infarctions each year and of these, approximately 500,000 persons are expected to survive through the first few hours and the subsequent hospitalization. Put another way, a U.S. male has a 1 in 5 chance of having a myocardial infarction or suffering sudden death before the age of 60. Further, once coronary artery disease is symptomatic regardless of whether the symptom is an gina or myocardial infarction the mortality rate is increased to 4 per year overall and 8 per year in those with an abnormal electrocardiogram or hyperten sion. This increased mortality is due to sudden death or the complications of repeated myocardial infarction. Nearly all symptomatic coronary artery disease is due to coronary atherosclerosis, a pathologic process which results in the narrowing of the coronary arteries the arteries which supply the heart itself with blood due to the presence of excess cellular and connective tissue materials and an abnormal accumulation of choles terol. The presence of these narrowings in addition to spasm of the arteries in the area of the narrowings results in an inadequate blood supply to the myocardium or muscle of the heart. This inadequate blood supply is called ischemia and is expressed by a spectrum of condi tions including angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death. However, and most significantly, myocardial ischemia may be entirely silent , i.e. the patient may be totally unaware of a sudden and potentially dangerous decrease in the blood supply to his heart. Regardless of the initial expression of the coronary artery disease, patients with symptoms are at an increased risk for myocardial infarction and or sud den death. The current approach to the therapy of this condition has been to make a definitive diagnosis by historical criteria, stress testing, radionuclide stu dies, and coronary arteriography and then to treat the patient with medication and or coronary artery bypass surgery. Despite major advances in surgical technique, and the availability of long acting nitrates, beta adrenergic blockers, and calcium antagonists, the death rate from cardiovascular disease has declined only slightly. This suggests the need for new therpeutic approaches. Traditionally, physicians have recognized the presence of acute myocardial ischemia by noting the occurrence of angina in the patient. Indeed, success of therapy is often gauged by how well the symptom of an gina is controlled, i.e. how effective medication or surgery has been at decreasing the frequency and se verity of anginal attacks. This is because when angina occurs, it indicates that ischemia is present, and when ischemia is present the chance of myocardial infarction or sudden death is increased. In theory, decrease in attacks of angina should translate into a decrease in myocardial infarction and sudden death in point of fact, the decrease has been small. The development of apparatus to perform ana lyses on electrocardiographic EKG signals has facili tated recognition of myocardial ischemia in a patient. Through these analyses it has become widely accepted that a depression of the portion of the EKG signal known as the ST segment, relative to the isoelectric segment of the signal, correlates with partial lack of blood supply, while elevation of the ST segment relative to the isoelectric segment of the signal correlates with a complete lack of blood supply. Once the ST segment was identified as an indi cator of myocardial ischemia, it was then verified that during anginal attacks the ST segment was altered a deviation of the ST segment could actually precede the experience of angina by several minutes, or even be entirely silent. Silent episodes are no less dangerous then anginal episodes, and occur in patients with equal ly as extensive coronary disease as those with anginal episodes, and are frequently accompanied by ventricular rhythm disturbances. An individual patient may express ischemia silently at all times, may have angina during many is chemic episodes, or have both silent and symptomatic episodes. Recently it has been suggested that these silent episodes may be a predictor of myocardial infarc tion and death. The patient s failure to sense the myocardial ischemia by experiencing discomfort has been called the result of a defective anginal warning system as it were, and such a defect may be one of the reasons for the high incidence of myocardial infarction and sudden death. Concern for patients with coronary artery disease and rhythm disturbances has led to the develop ment of various devices for the monitoring of EKG sig nals. These devices typically are classified into three groups 1 devices which record EKG signals continu ously for predetermined periods of time on magnetic tape for subsequent printing and analysis by specially trained techni cians and or computers see U.S. Patent No. 3,267,934 to Thornton 2 devices which analyze the EKG signal as it is generated by the patient and which store selected data for subsequent analy sis see U.S.Patent Nos. 4,073,001 and 4,006,737 to Cherry et al and 3 patient activated devices which record, store and or transmit EKG signals to a remote location for analysis when the patient notices something abnormal, or on a preselected basis see U.S. Patent No. 3,724,454 to Unger . The first two groups of devices require so phisticated and costly off line analysis of large amounts of data which may be available only after the event s being monitored has occurred. The third group of devices has the limitations that only symptomatic events detected by the patient are available for analy sis, or the preselected schedule established for moni toring signals may permit major EKG events to be missed entirely. In summary, starting from this technology, the invention goes forward to provide a portable heart moni toring device which in a real time on going manner looks at each and every heart beat, which analyzes each heart beat for certain abnormalities, and upon detecting a problem or even a potential problem, alerts the user, at the discretion of his physician by program ming to the fact, and does so virtually instantly no later than upon completion of that particular suspect heart beat or group s of heart beats or ST segment deviations. Because of the data storage and handling abilities and the speed of current computer technology, the invention device in effect gives the patient the benefit of a cardiologist who is diagnosing each beat of his heart, and who will prescribe treatment or recommend other action instantly upon any one of a rela tively large number of problems stored in the computer s memory arising. The invention is thus a dramatic step forward in the healing arts, and it is expected that the invention will save a large number of lives. It is therefore an object of the present in vention to provide apparatus which will continuously monitor and analyze EKG or ECG signals generated by an ambulatory patient, diagnose abnormal events and in struct the patient on the manner of treatment required. Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable computerized EKG monitor for perform ing real time analysis of EKG signals to recognize and diagnose myocardial ischemic conditions and thereupon to immediately issue instructions for treatment or other action to the ambulatory user himself. Another object of the invention is to provide a portable, light weight computer which performs contin uous real time analysis of EKG information to detect, and alert an ambulatory use of, ischemic conditions, including the silent or pre symptomatic type. Another object is to provide a miniaturized EKG computer for identifying ST segment depression or elevation to assist the treatment of myocardial ischemia in an ambulatory patient. Still another object is to provide a method of analysis of EKG signals which will permit identification of ST depression or elevation indicative of myocardial ischemia, as well as recognition and identification of pulse rate, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular premature beats. Yet another object is to provide a method of analysis of EKG signals which will discriminate between valid QRS complex information and information due to noise or artifacts. These and other objects and advantages are attained by the provision of a device and method of the character described.

Figs. 8 10 illustrate the logic flow chart of the Housekeeping Block shown in Fig. 3. Referring now to the drawings in more detail, there is shown in Figure 1 a typical EKG waveform of a heart of a normal healthy person which exhibits a P wave of positive polarity, a QRS complex consisting of a negative Q wave, a positive R wave and a negative S wave, and finally a T wave separated from the QRS com plex by an ST segment. J is a point in the ST segment and defines the end of the S portion thereof. Normally, in a healthy person the EKG signals will occur regularly at a frequency of about 60 80 beats per minute. Under abnormal conditions the pulse rate may be very erratic. The P wave is normally a small positive wave in certain leads that corresponds to the initial impulse that triggers the commencement of the heartbeat and the resulting reflexive physiological expansions and contractions that are involved in the heart beat. Immediately following the P wave there is a quiescent portion of substantially uniform amplitude. Normally, this portion will have a time duration on the order of greater than 0.04 second and will have a con stant or fixed amplitude that may be used as an isoelec tric or base line signal. As a result, the amplitude of this portion may be employed as a reference against which the remaining portions of the EKG signal may be measured. Alternatively, the segment just prior to the P wave, the TP segment, may be utilized for definition of the isoelectric amplitude or base line. At the conclusion of the isoelectric signal, normally after the P wave, the QRS complex occurs. The complex commences in certain ECG leads with a so called Q wave which is a small negative pulse. The Q wave is succeeded in certain ECG leads by the R wave, which is the most conspicuous portion of the EKG signal. It com prises a positive pulse having an amplitude greater than any of the other waves present in the EKG signal. Nor mally, the R wave will have the appearance of a spike with a sharp rise, a sharp fall, and a relatively short duration. More particularly, it is believed that the maximum time duration will normally be on the order of 0.03 to 0.04 second. However, certain types of abnor malities, such as premature ventricular beats resulting from an ectopic focus or foci of depolarization in the ventricle, may result in an EKG signal characterized by a distortion of the R wave and particularly an increase in width thereof. In other forms of premature ventri cular beats, the R wave may even become inverted i.e. of negative polarity . Following the R wave the QRS complex termi nates in an S wave. The S wave may be similar to the Q wave in that it is usually a small negative pulse in certain ECG leads. Following the QRS complex and the S wave, there will normally be a T wave which is separated from the S wave by the so called ST segment. The ST segment normally originates at the J point which represents the termination of the S wave. The amplitude of this ST segment normally is approximately equal to the isoelec tric portion between the termination of the P wave and the commencement of the Q wave, i.e., the ST portion is usually at base line level. A waveform which is representative of myocar dial ischemia may cause the amplitude of level of the ST segment to appear substantially more negative or more positive than the isoelectric portion. An ST segment depression is indicative of an inadequate supply of blood or oxygen to the heart, while an ST segment eleva tion indicates that the entire heart wall thickness is without adequate blood of oxygen. Referring now to Figure 2 there is shown a generalized schematic view of the apparatus of the pre sent invention in which leads 102, 103 and 104 represent electrodes and wires attached to the patient P at pre determined locations preferably in a conventional manner the preferred embodiment envisions non instrusive elec trode to patient attachment . The electrodes are pre ferably of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,420,223, 3,490,440 and 3,665,064. Lead 104 functions to ground the apparatus, while leads 102 and 103 feed EKG signals, detected by the electrodes, to a pre ampli fier and filtering component 106 to perform two func tions first, to amplify the signals detected by the electrodes, and second to eliminate undesirable noise. The amplifier, while of conventional design must provide a uniform amount of gain over an adequate bandwidth to effectively amplify all of the components in the EKG signal without producing any distortions so that the output signal from the amplifier is a true and amplified reproduction of the EKG signal picked up by the elec trodes. The output of the amplifier is fed to a con verter 108 of the analog to digital A D type. The converter is connected, via a system bus 150, to a mi croprocessor 120 driven by a clock 122 through connec tion 124, one or more random access memory RAM compo nents 130, one or more read only memory ROM components 140, an alpha numeric display device 145, a keyboard 165 and an alarm means 175. A lithium battery can be em ployed as a back up for the memory components. A key board interface component 160 couples keyboard 165 to the system bus 150 while an alarm interface 170 couples alarm means 175 to the system bus. The speeds, capaci ties, etc. of the hardware components needed to imple ment the invention can be determined by persons skilled in these arts, based on the teachings herein. Figure 3, which is a master logic flow diagram of the present invention, shows the amplified, filtered and digitized EKG signal provided from A D converter 108 in Fig. 2 passing to beat detection block 200 to be described in greater detail below . The logic of the beat detection block examines the EKG signal for a sus pected QRS complex and for suspected ventricular prema ture beat VPB occurrences. If a pattern of signals which suggest the existence of a VPB is detected, the logic of beat detection block 200 sends appropriate information via lead 111 to the VPB verification logic block 300 also to be described in more detail below . If a pattern of signals which suggests the existence of a QRS complex is discerned, the logic of beat detection block 200 sends appropriate information via lead 112 to the QRS verification block 400 also to be described in more detail below . If the logic of block 400 verifies a QRS occurrence, the logic passes to block 500 by line 117 to determine the possible existence of VPB. On the other hand, if prematurity is detected, the logic passes to block 300 via line 115 to determine whether the suspected signal has further VPB characteristics. The outputs of blocks 300 and 500 are fed via line 114 or line 118, respectively to the housekeeping block 600 described in more detail below for further processing. Lead lines 119 from block 200 , 113 from block 300 and 116 from block 400 facilitate the transmission of information which is indicative of a discerned error to a system management or housekeeping block 600 where, upon its receipt, an alarm may be set off depending on the nature of the event which generates the so called error signal. Examples of such errors which could trigger activation of an alarm are disconnection of an electrode, insufficient battery power, battery failure, loss of signal , excessive noise, and others. Figure 4 shows the logic in beat detection block 200. Beat detection block 200 determines the existence of, and discriminates between, two basic sig nal patterns received from A D converter 108. These signal patterns are indicative of events which signal the onset of the cardiac complications with which this invention is concerned one pattern represents the onset and inflection points of QRS complexes, followed by an ST segment, while the other pattern is indicative of ventricular premature beats VPB s . Taking a closer look at the beat detection block 200 in Fig. 4, the sequence of amplified, filtered and digitized signal samples are examined at block 210 for a period of time up to, but not exceeding, 2 min utes. In this time frame, the logic of block 210 calcu lates the slope of the signal values and then compares the slope with a predetermined threshold value. If the slope exceeds the threshold value within the 2 minute period, the logic of block 210 determines that a wave form indicative of a QRS complex has begun, and the logic proceeds, via line 214, to block 220. If within the two minute interval, the slope does not exceed the threshold valve, the logic of block 210 generates an error signal which passes via lines 212 and then 119 to the system management or housekeeping block 600 to sound an alarm. After block 210 determines the onset of a slope indicative of a QRS complex, calculations are made at block 220 for the purpose of determining, and there fore confirming, whether a following beat actually oc curs the suspected QRS waveform is actually a VPB. The signal sequence is examined at block 220 during the time in which the slope amplitude and direction sign remain within specified predetermined tolerances for a maximum of 2 seconds. If the sequence completes in less than 125 milliseconds the logic of block 220 indicates the existence of a suspected QRS waveform, and the process moves to block 400 via line 112. If the change occurs in a time equal to or greater than 125 milliseconds, and not greater than 2 seconds the logic of block 220 determines that the sequence of values exhibit charac teristics of a VPB, and the logic moves to block 300 for confirmation of the VPB via line 115. If no change occurs within 2 seconds, the logic of block 220 issues an error signal which is sent to the system management on housekeeping block 600 via lines 216 and 119. While waiting for the change in slope direc tion, the following calculations are made at block 220. 1 2 3 Referring now to Fig. 5, the logic flow dia gram of the QRS verification block 400 is shown in which the information from block 220 if Fig. 4 is checked to confirm the existence of a QRS waveform. Block 410 counts the turns in the waveform and determines whether the number of turns falls within a range indicative of a normal QRS waveform. If the number of turns counted is less than 3 or greater than 5, the suspected waveform is not a QRS waveform, and this information is passed to housekeeping block 600 via lines 412 and then 119. If the number of turns counted falls within the range of 3, 4 or 5, the logic moves via yes line 414 to block 420 where the amplitude of the suspected waveform peak is compared to an empirical value to make sure that the waveform detected by block 200 is a proper QRS curve and not a P wave of a noise pulse or anything else not a QRS. If the peak amplitude does not fall within accep table limits, an error signal is transmitted via lines 422 and 119 to housekeeping block 600. If it is deter mined that the peak amplitude falls within acceptable limits, the logic moves to block 430 via line 424 where a determination is made as to whether the waveform gen erated by the heartbeat is premature. This is accom plished by computing and maintaining a running, updated average of time duration between a series of successive QRS waveform peaks and then comparing the running aver age time to the time between the current QRS peak and the last QRS peak. In this manner, heart EKG informa tion resulting from both a patient who is exercising and from a patient who is at rest is accommodated. If the logic of block 430 determines that the beat is not pre mature, a QRS waveform is confirmed and that information is sent to block 500 via line 432. If the logic of block 430 determines that the time between the current and last QRS peak is shorter that the running updated average time, the beat is considered premature a possi ble VPB, and this information passes to block 440 via line 434. Blocks 440 and 450 perform a secondary check on a suspected QRS waveform which also appears to occur prematurely, i.e. a VPB. For example, without the test provided by blocks 440 an 450 the invention device might otherwise incorrectly identify the end of a waveform in a case where there is an erratic signal portion before the actual termination of the waveform. Block 440 first determines whether the previous beat exhibited true QRS waveform characteristics. The double ended line 436 interconnecting block 440 to line 432 carries the QRS confirmed signal. If the previous beat was not a true QRS waveform, there is no proper QRS by which the com parison may be made and the logic returns to line 432. If true QRS waveform characteristics have been detected, and a comparison can be made, the VPB verification logic flows on to block 450 where another check is accom plished by comparing the area under the present waveform to the area under the previous waveform. If the areas are similar, the logic confirms the existence of a pro per, albeit premature, QRS waveform and returns to line 432. If the compared areas are not similar, the logic flows to Block 300 described in detail below where an analysis is performed to determine whether the waveform is characteristic of a Ventricular Premature Beat VPB . Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown a detailed logic flow diagram for block 300 for the veri fication of suspected ventricular premature beat wave forms detected at the beat detection block 200 shown in Fig. 4. The logic of block 310 determines whether the number of turns of a curve associated with a heart beat counted at block 220 Fig. 4 falls within a range indi cative of a VPB waveform. If there are at least 3 turns, but no more than 7 turns, then the logic flows to block 320. Whereas 5 turns defined the upper limit for a QRS waveform, the larger number of 7 turns is permitted for VPB verification. If the number counted falls outside this range, block 310 generates an appro priate error signal which is sent to housekeeping or system management by Block 600. The logic of block 320 compares the peak am plitude of the suspected VPB waveform with empirical values indicative of upper and lower acceptable limits in a manner similar to that comparison performed in block 420 see Fig. 5 . If the peak amplitude of the waveform falls outside the range, an error signal is generated and sent to housekeeping block 600. If the peak amplitude falls within the range of acceptable limits, the logic flows to block 330 where the previous beat is examined to determine if it too was a VPB. If the previous beat was not a VPB, block 350 determines whether the current beat is premature. If so, the in formation is sent to the system management or housekeep ing block 600 via line 114. If not, an error signal is sent to the system management or housekeeping block 600. If the logic of block 330 determines that the previous beat was a VPB, it is not possible to check prematurity of the current beat for obvious reasons. Instead block 340 compares the area under the waveform associated with the last beat with the area under the waveform asso ciated with the current beat. This comparison is made with the expectation that the areas will be similar. If the areas are not similar, the logic sends an error signal to system management or housekeeping block 600 via line 113. If the areas are similar, the logic re turns to line 114 and then to system management or housekeeping block 600. Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a detailed logic flow chart of the VPB Verification Block 500 which checks to see whether the waveform confirmed by block 400 was preceded by a VPB. In a case where a QRS waveform follows a ventricular premature beat, the interval between the QRS waveform and the premature beat will be greater than the running updated average time interval computed at block 430 in Fig. 5 . Block 510 determines if the previous beat was a suspected VPB. If not, control is transferred to system management or housekeeping block 600 via line 118. If the previous beat was a suspected VPB, the compensatory interval is calculated for the purpose of checking for the presence of a compensatory pause which would indicate that the suspected VPB was a true VPB. The current average pulse interval is added to the time at which the QRS complex preceding the suspected VPB is known to have occurred. This result represents a point in time at which a normal beat following a VPB would fall if a compensatory pause were present. If the cur rent beat s time diverges from the calculated time by more than 12.5 of the current average pulse interval, a compensatory pause is not indicated. The foregoing procedure is repeated three 3 additional times with the average pulse interval being added to the previously calculated compensatory interval each time. This proce dure allows for the verification of interpolated VPB s as well as the possibility of verification of VPB s which are followed by undetected QRS complexes. If no verification can be made by the end of the fourth 4th attempt, control is transferred to line 118. If verifi cation is possible, control is transferred to block 530 where the suspected VPB is labelled a confirmed VPB. The logic of the system management or house keeping block 600, illustrated in Figs. 8 10, performs several functions a certain events described in more detail below in connection with Fig. 8 which require the suspension of normal beat processing are monitored b specified parameters are updated or measured described in more detail below in connection with Fig. 9 c certain events which trigger condi tions are identified and appropriate alarm instructions are issued described in more detail below in connection with Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 8, the logic of block 810 tests whether the power supply is at an acceptable le vel, i.e. of sufficient voltage to maintain operation of the inventive device. The test is performed by conven tional means not shown. If the level of power is not acceptable, the logic of block 810 moves to block 820 where an alarm flag is set for LOW BATTERY . This information is passed via line 899 to the alarm block 1070 in Fig. 10, while the logic flows to block 830. If the level of power is determined to be acceptable, the logic moves directly to block 830 where it is determined whether there has been a loss of the signal. This con dition results from the failure of the device to detect a heartbeat for a period of 2 minutes, and generally is caused by system or patient failure. If, within, the two minute interval, no signal has been detected, the logic moves to block 840 where an alarm flag is set for a LOSS OF SIGNAL condition. This information is then passed via line 899 to the alarm block 1070 shown in Fig. 10 . If a beat has been detected within 2 min utes, the analysis proceeds to block 850 where the logic determines whether SIGNAL CLIPPING has occurred. If so, the analysis moves to block 860 where an alarm flag is set for a CLIPPING condition, and the information is sent via line 899 to alarm block 1070 shown in Fig. 10 . If the logic fails to discern the existence of SIGNAL CLIPPING , the analysis moves to block 870 where a determination is made whether NOISE , i.e. a condi tion exhibiting excessive changes in slope, has been detected. If so, the analysis moves to block 880 where an alarm flag is set for a NOISE condition and a sig nal corresponding to this condition is sent to alarm block 1070 shown in Fig. 10 . If no noise has been detected, the analysis proceeds to block 910 in Fig. 9 where the system determines whether a QRS waveform ac companied the previous beat. If not, the analysis pro ceeds directly to block 1010 in Fig. 10. If so, how ever, the analysis moves successively to blocks 920, 930 and 940. At block 920 the pulse average is updated, at block 930 the ST segment level is measured, and at block 940 one ST segment average is updated. The analysis then moves to block 1010 in Fig. 10, where the logic looks at the results of the analysis performed for the current beat and the last two beats to determine whether all 3 beats exhibits VPB characteristics. If they do, the analysis moves to block 1020 where an alarm flag is set for a condition indicative of Ventricular Tachy cardia and this information is sent to Alarm Block 1070 via line 1099. If the 3 beats examined at block 1010 do not exhibit VPB characteristics, the analysis proceeds to block 1030 where the results of the analysis per formed for only the current beat and the last beat are examined. If the logic determines that for both beats VPB characteristics were exhibited, the analysis moves to block 1040 where an alarm flag is set for a condition known as COUPLET and an appropriate signal is passed to block 1070 via line 1099 otherwise the analysis moves to block 1050 where the logic determines if the ST segment average is within acceptable limits. These limits are empirical values determined for any beat as a function of the isoelectric portion of the PQRST wave form associated with that beat. If the measured ST segment value falls within the limits, the logic pro ceeds to block 1070. If the measured ST segment value falls outside the limits, the logic moves to block 1060 where an alarm flag is set to reflect either a condition for ST SEGMENT DEPRESSION or ST SEGMENT ELEVATION , and a signal corresponding to the condition detected is sent to alarm block 1070 via line 1099. Block 1070, which receives information passed through block 1050 from line 1099 and from line 899, and then reads the alarm flags set and displays alarms cor responding to the various detected conditions of the device and the patient. In addition, block 1070 updates the stored counts for VPB couplets, ventricular tachy cardia episodes and their total duration, as well as the total ST segment duration. The logic then returns to the beat detection block 200. The method of determining the significance of the slope signal at each sampling period carried out by the logic of block 210 is explained below with reference to Figures 11 14. This method of handling data and determining slope is deemed to have general utility beyond the present invention. This method is accomplished using four shift registers each having six bits length see Figure 11 . Of course, this portion of the invention can also be carried out by using shift registers of longer or shor ter length, or even with a different number of shift registers. The patterns in these shift registers re flect slope conditions. Each bit represents one of four conditions at each sampling period and thus each shift register contains a running recond of the most current six sampling periods. The four conditions are positive slope upwardly directed negative slope downwrdly directed active slopegreater than threshold quiescent slope less than threshold Each shift register bit will have either 1 a value of 1 bit set which indicates that the approxi mate condition is fulfilled, or 2 a value of 0 bit reset which indicates that the respective condition has not been fulfilled. Each shift register also includes a Flag Bit . This bit is updated after each sampling period and reflects either a majority of bits set, Flag Bit set or a majority of bits not set Flag Bit reset in the corresponding shift register. A Flag Bit which is set thus represents a trend in slope direction or magnitude. Referring now to Figures 12 13, at Block A the slope for the current EKG is calculated in ac cordance with the equation At Block B, the slope is examined to determine whether the value is positive or negative. If the slope has a negative value, the logic first proceeds to Block C where the positive slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to zero, and then proceeds to Block D where the negative slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to 1. If, however, the slope has a positive value, the logic first proceeds to Block E where the positive slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to 1, and then proceeds to Block F where the negative slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to zero. After shifting the appropriate slope registers and setting the appropriate bits corresponding to a detected positive or negative slope value, the logic proceeds to block G where the quantitative aspect of the calculated slope value is compared to the value which represents the predetermined quiescent threshold. The quiescent threshold is generally taken to be 0.02 milli volts change in each 256th of a second period. This value differentiates waveforms which represent QRS com plexes from other waveforms with which this method is not concerned. If the value of the slope is less than the quiescent threshold, the logic proceeds continue to Fig. 13 first to Block H where the active slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to zero, and then proceeds to Block I where the quiescent slope shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to 1. On the other hand, if the value of the slope is greater than, or equal to, the quiescent threshold, the logic proceeds first to Block J where the active shift register is shifted to the left and the rightmost bit is set to 1, and then proceeds to Block K where the quiescent slope shift register is shifted one bit to the left and the rightmost bit position is set to zero. After completing the operations at either Block I or Block K the Flag Bit for each register is updated to indicate a trend Flag Bit set to 1 or ab sence of trend Flag Bit set to 0 . Next, referring to Figure 14, the procedure for updating slope quality shift register Flag Bits is described this procedure is performed four times, once for each shift register . Overall, this invention uses the fact that six or some other number of positions in a shift register also represent a number, and the fact that machines are very quick at looking up numbers in a table. Thus, with a possibility of 1 through 64 possible answers for six bit positions, corresponding to the numbers 0 63, the invention provides a table stored in the machine, certain numbers of which correspond to certain realities of the slope and of the threshold. Thus, the machine can look at the contents of each shift register every 256th part of a second, look at the number, look it up in the table, and thereby quickly determine the quality of the slope as to positive or negative, the threshold exceeded or not exceeded, and set the Flat Bits accord ingly. More specifically, to implement this concept the bits are used as an index, i.e., a six bit binary word will correspond to one of 64 addresses in a 64 byte table Block R . For 5 or 7 bit shift registers, the addresses and other parameters would be adjusted accord ingly. This table is stored in memory and contains 64 entries, each of which corresponds respectively to each of the 64 six bit binary words which may be used to address the table. Each entry represents whether a majority or minority of bits, in the corresponding six bit word obtained from one of the shift registers, have been set, i.e. have a value of 1. The value of the High Order Bit of each entry is either set i.e. assigned the value of 1 if a majority of bits in the six bit word have been set, or reset assigned the value of 0 if a majority of bits in the six bit word have not been set. Thus the High Order Bit will have a value 0 for the first six entries, but will have a value 1 for the eighth entry. Using the six bit binary address obtained from the respective shift register being updated, a value is retrieved from the table Block S in Figure 14 . This value is used as a replacement for the Flag Bit of the shift register being updated Block T . After the shift registers have been updated as described above, the values of the Flag Bits are exa mined to detect the following conditions Upon the completion of operations in Block 210 of the Beat Detection Block in which the onset of a slope indicative of a QRS complex is identified, the logic proceeds to Block 220, as described above. It is to be understood that the present inven tion is not limited to the embodiments disclosed which are illustratively offered and that modifications may be made without departing from the invention.
