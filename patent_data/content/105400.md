# Process for preparing a heat resistant soft composite.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a heat resistant soft composite which comprises hot pressing a mixture comprising talc powder and mica powder as major components and a bonding material composed of normal boric acid, boric acid anhydride and zinc oxide, at a temperature of from 160 to 200 C under pressure of from 50 to 100 kg cmÂ² to form a composite, and subjecting the composite to heat treatment at a temperature of from 450 to 500 C.
