# Growth substrate bed.

## Abstract
The invention provides a growth substrate bed suitable for growing plants, which is easy to handle and transport. Such a bed consists of a bag shaped casing or other flexible container made of some suitable material, preferably plastic, partly filled with a growth substrate medium, preferably particulate, which swells when water is added thereto. A suitable growth substrate medium is compressed peat pellets. The bag is filled with the medium to such an extent that after watering the medium will fill the bag completely. In order to preserve a uniform distribution of the medium in the bag during handling and transportation and before watering, the bed is rolled up, preferably in its longitudinal direction.
