# Electrochemical cell having a safety vent closure and method for its assembly.

## Abstract
A non resealble vent closure for galvanic cells, such as nonaqueous oxyhalide cells, which comprises a member 56 force fitted within a vent orifice 25 and wherein a corrosion resistant material 27 which is not an integral part of the force fitted member 56 is disposed between the wall defining the vent orifice 25 and the force fitted member 56 so as to predictably insure venting after a predetermined gas pressure build up within the cell.
