# Alkylating toluene with methanol to form styrene.

## Abstract
A process for alkylating toluene or derivative thereof with methanol to form e.g. styrene and ethylbenzene or derivatives thereof using a modified low sodium content zeolite catalyst composition is disclosed. The zeolite catalyst composition is exemplified by a type X or Y zeolite modified with potassium and cesium through a sequential exchange.
