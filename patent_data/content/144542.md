# Buckling clutch assembly.

## Abstract
A mechanical torque transmitting apparatus such as a one way clutch which includes two distinct sets of flexural arms primary 20 and auxiliary 26 and a cylindrical engagement surface 18 . The primary flexural arm 20 is adapted to be in edgewise continuous engagement with the cylindrical surface 18 . Preferably, the primary flexural arm 20 has a long, straight, narrow cross section area and applies a relatively low force against the cylindrical surface 18 when said surface is rotating in a free wheeling direction 16 . In the non free wheeling direction, the force against the cylindrical surface 18 increases until the rotational forces overcome and buckle the primary flexural arm 20 whereup on the auxiliary flexural arm 26 is brought into contact with the cylindrical surface 18 to resist further rotation.
