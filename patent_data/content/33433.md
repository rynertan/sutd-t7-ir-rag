Subcultures of Micromonospora polytrota NRRL 12066 are available to the public from the afore mentioned agency. A culture of this micro organism has been made a part of the collection of the American Type Culture Collection ATCC , where it has been assigned accession number ATCC 31584. Subcultures of Micromonospora polytrota ATCC 31584 are available to the public from the ATCC.Micromonospora polytrota sometimes referred to herein as N.polytrota is aerobic and grows well on a variety of solid and liquid nutrient media. It exhibits especially good growth and antibiotic production under submerged aerobic conditions.The microorganism may be distinguished from other heretofore known species of the genus Micromonospora by a variety of taxonomical parameters. For example,Micromonospora polytrota forms spores, grows on Dand L arabinose and fructose fails to grow on rhamnose and D xylose utilizes citrate, formate, lactate and oxalate grows in the presence of 50 mcg per milliliter of gentamicin, sisomicin, kanamycin, lincon cin and clindamycin exhibits sensitivity to rosaramicin and chloramphenicol hydrolyzes hypoxanthine and hippurate does not hydrolyze xylan and chitin.The microorganism also forms urease and allantionase survives a temperature of 500C for eight hours. Other distinguishing characteristics which aid in determining that Micromonospora polytrota is novel are its growth characteristics on various descriptive media.The foregoing distinguishing characteristics were determined using the following procedures whose results are set forth in detail in the disclosure that follows.Strain MaintenanceThe initial source material was a freeze dried preparation. The contents of the vial were suspended in 10 ml of broth consisting of yeast extract5 5g dextrose, 10 g soluble starch, 20 g NZ Amine type A Difco , 5g CaCO. 1 g tap water, 1000 ml in 25 mm tubes stoppered withMorton closures. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 before autoclaving. The broth suspension was incubated at 30 0C on a rotary shaker New Brunswick, Model Gut2 at 250 rpm for 3 to 4 days. After growth5 5 ml of the resulting biomass was transferred into 50 ml of fresh medium having the composition described above in a 250 mlErlenmeyer flask stoppered with cotton.

Five ml aliquots of the resulting biomass were asceptically dispensed into 17 x 60 mm sterile screwcapped vials and stored at 18 C. Preparation of InoculaOne ml of thawed cell suspension was used to inoculate 25 mm tubes containing 10 ml of the strain maintenance broth, incubated as described above, and 5 inoculum transferred to two tubes of fresh broth. After three days at 300C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation Sorvall, Model GLC 1 at 450 x g for 15 minutes in 15 ml graduated tubes, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in water to three times the packed cell volume. The resulting washed suspension was used as inoculum for the taxonomy tests reported below.A 1 transfer of Micromonospora polytrota was made into duplicate 25 x 150 mm tubes containing 10 ml of a medium consisting of yeast extract, 1 g soluble starch, 1 g dextrose, 1 g CaCO3 , 1 g tap water , 1000 ml or a medium consisting of yeast extract, 10 g soluble starch, 20 g CaCO35 1 g tap water, 1000 ml or a medium consisting of yeast extract, 5 g dextrose, 10 g Cacao3 1 g tap water, 1000 ml or a medium consisting of yeast extract, 1 g dextrose, 10 g CaCO. 1 g tap water, 1000 ml. Tubes were stoppered with Morton closures and incubated at 35 0C on a rotary shaker New Brunswick Scientific, Model G 52 at 250 rpm.At 3, 5, 7 and 14 days, aliquots from the tubes were thinly spread onto the surface of glass cover slips, air dried and inverted onto a glass slide into a drop of dilute crystal violet solution 1 10 with distilled water . Slides were examined under the phase microscope at magnifications up to 2000 times. Micromonospora polytrota was inoculated onto the surface of various agar media in petri dishes an agar consisting of yeast extract, 10 g dextrose, 10 agar, 15 g tap water, 1000 ml pH 7.0 a water agar consisting of tap water, 1000 ml agar, 15 g pH 7.0 and a half strength starch agar consisting of yeast extract, 1.5 g potato starch, 5.0 g distilled water5 1000 ml agar, 15 g pH 7.0.

The color designations assigned to the vegetative mycelium pigments consisted of a color name 2 Descriptive Color Names Dictionary, Taylor, H.D. Knoche, L. Granville, W.C., Container Corp. of America, 1950 and a colorchip number 3 Color Harmony Manual, Ed. 4, Chicago, Container Corp. of America, 1958 . Utilization of CarbohydratesTo 5 ml of the sterile, molten basal carbohydrate medium consisting of yeast extract5 5g CaCO35 1 g agar, 15 g tap water, 1000 ml in 16 x 15C mm screw cap tubes, 0.5 ml of a 10 sterile solution of each test carbohydrate was added, the contents thoroughly mixed, and the tubes slanted. The slants were inoculated with Micromonospora polytrota using a sterile pipette. Tubes were observed for growth after 21 days at 35 C. Decomposition of Organic CompoundsThe decomposition of adenine, tyrosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, xylan, urea, and allantoin were measured according to the procedures described by Lechevalier in the publication referred to herein above.Chitin hydrolysis was measured using a modification of the procedure of Veldkamp Veldkamp H. A study of the aerobic decomposition of chitin by microorganisms , Neded Landbouw Wageningen 55 127 174, 1955 . Ten ml of solidified water agar dispensed into 16 x 50 mm petri dishes was overlaid with 2.5 ml of colloidal chitin agar prepared as described below. Plates were inoculated with a streak down the center, incubated for 7, 14 and 21 days at 350C and examined for dissolution of the chitin.Hydrolysis of hippurate was determined using a modifiedBaird Parker medium sodium hippurate, 10 g dextrose, 2 g tryptone, 2 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 2 g Na2HP04, 5 g distilled water, 1000 ml pH 7.0 .The medium was dispensed in 10 ml aliquots into 25 mm tubes stoppered with Morton closures. Tubes were inoculated with the test culture, and incubated at 300C on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. After 7 and 14 days, the culture was tested for benzoic acid by mixing 1 ml of the culture broth, free of clumps, with 1,5 ml of 50 sulfuric acid in a 16 mm test tube. The appearance of crystals in the acid mixture after 4 hours at room temperature indicated hydrolysis of the hippurate.Temperature RelationshipsThe ability of the test organisms to grow at 280C, 35 0C, 40 C and 45 C and to survive at 5OOC was tested on agar slants consisting of yeast extract, 5 g dextrose, 10 g soluble starch, 20 g NZ Amine A Difco , 5 g CaCO3, 1 g agar, 15 g tap water, 1000 ml employing the techniques outlined by Gordon et al Gordon RE Barnett DA Henderhan JE PANGrH Nocardia coeliaca, Nocardia autotrophica, and nocardin strain. Int.J.Syst.Bacteriol. 24, 54 63, 1974 . Antibiotic Susceptibility of the Novel StrainTest antibiotics were dissolved in the appropriate solvent at a concentration based on an activity of 1000 mcg ml. Stock solutions were diluted in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 500 mcg ml and filter sterilized 0.45 mm filters, MilliporeCorporation . To 10 ml of the sterile antibiotic solutions, there was added 90 ml of melted agar consisting of yeast extract, 10 g dextrose, 10 g agar, 15 g tap water, 1000 ml pH 2.0 cooled to 45 C, and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was aseptically pipetted into sterile petri dishes 100 x 150 mm . The final concentration of each antibiotic in the agar was 50 mcg ml.Utilization of Organic AcidsUtilization of organic acids was determined using the procedures given by Gordon et al,in the publication referred to above. MorphologyMorphologically, some broth preparations of Micromonospora polytrota exhibit a vegetative mycelium formed in large clumps which are difficult to break up. The hyphae are fine, 0.8 to 1.2 microns, and are abundantly branched. The branched hyphae exhibit swelling which form unusual type structures. Spores are not formed to any substantial degree in the broth media utilized even after 10 days incubation. When present, the spores occur singly along the length of the hyphae, either attached directly to the mycelium or on sporophores.By contrast, abundant sporulation is observed on the first and third starch agar media utilized in the morphological tests. Electron microscopic observation of the spore silhouettes revealed the presence of protrubances or warts along the spore surface.Hydrolyzed whole cells contain the meso isomer of diaminopimelic acid. Arabinose and xylose are the characteristic sugars. Mazroscopic observations of the growth, or lack thereof, of M. polytrota on a variety of descriptive media are set forth on Table 1 below. Macroscopic observations of the utilization, or lack thereof, of carbohydrates and organic acids by M.polytrota are set forth on Table 2 below.Table 3 sets forth the growth, or lack thereof, of N.polytrota in the presence of representative antibiotics.The table further sets forth the microorganism s growth, or lack thereof, in the presence of inorganic salts at various concentrations.Additionally, Table 3 sets forth the microorganism s ability, or lack thereof, to hydrolyze a variety of compounds which are carbon and nitrogen sources.

Exemplary of such assimilable carbon sources are the carbohydrates. Exemplary of such assimilable sources of nitrogen are extracts from proteins. Preferred carbohydrates are tryptose, starch, dextrose, cerelose, mannitol, glucose and the like.Preferred nitrogen sources are corn steep liquor, yeast extract, soybean meal, meat peptones, casein hydrolysate and the like.The pH of the fermentation medium and of the vegetative inoculum is adjusted prior to inoculation and is, preferably, maintained at from about 6.0 to about 8.5 by the incorporation of a buffer such as calcium carbonate in the fermentation medium or in the vegetative inoculum. The preferred pH range is from about 6.8 to about 7.2.Production of the antibiotics of this invention may be effected at most temperatures conducive to satisfactory growth of the microorganism e.g.between 200C and 4C C, preferably between 27 0C and and 35 0C. The most preferred temperature at which to prepare the vegetative inoculum and to conduct the fermentation is about 30 C. In general, the nutrient media are prepared in a suitable fermentation vessel or flask, are sterilized and cooled prior to inoculation. However, the media may be stored under aseptic conditions at low temperatures prior to use. In order to produce the antibiotic complex of this invention, a vigorously growing vegetative inoculum is preferred. In general, the inoculum preparation is carried out in two or more stages. For large scale fermentations e.g. about 50 liters , it is preferred that the inoculum be prepared in three stages.Suitable media for preparing vegetative inocula are as follows Medium A Medium BBeef Extract 3 g Potato Dextrin PD650 50 gTryptose 5 g Soy Grits . 35 gDextrose 1 g Dextrose 5 gPotato Starch 24 g Calcium Carbonate 7 gYeast Extract 5 g Cobalt Chloride 238 g Calcium Carbonate 2 g Tap Water to 1.C literTap Water to 1.0 liter Two ml of freshly thawed whole broth of M. polytrota is used to inoculate 50 ml of sterile medium A. The flask is incubated at about 300C for from about 48 to about 96, preferably about 72 hours on a gyratory shaker at about 300 rpm and a 2 inch throw. Twenty five rnl of the first inoculum is used to inoculate a series of 500 ml portions of sterile Medium B in two literErlenmeyer flasks.The flasks are incubated with gyratory agitation at about 300C for from about 24 to about 72, preferably 48 hours. Twenty five ml of the second inoculum is used to inoculate each of a series of 500 ml portions of sterile Medium B in two literErlenmeyer flasks. The flasks are incubated with gyratory agitation at about 300C for from about 24 to about 72, preferably 48 hours.The following medium has been found to provide both satisfactory and reproducible yields of antibiotic productionMedium CStaley J Starch 50 gDistillers Solubles 7.5 gPharamedia 5.0 gCerelose 5.0 gTap water to 1.0 liter For the production of the antibiotic complex ten liters of sterile Medium C are inoculated with 500 ml of the second stage inoculum prepared as described above.The fermentation mixture is incubated at from about 270 to about 35 0C, preferably at about 300C with rotary agitation and aeration at about 350 rpm and at 0.35 vvm, respectively. The pH of the fermentation mixture is maintained at from about 6.8 to about 7.2 by the addition of dilute alkali.The fermentation is permitted to proceed for from about 48 to about , preferably about 72 hours before commencing to monitor for antibioti activity. To monitor the fermentation, a sample of the whole broth is withdrawn and extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent. Exemplary of such solvents are methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate5 amyl acetate or the like, The preferred solvent is ethyl acetate. The monitoring is conducted by thin layer chromatography on silica gel using the lower phase of a solvent system consisting of chloroform methanol petroleum ether water in the ratio by volume of 3 3 1 1.Quantitation of antibiotic production may be made using High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC or other analytical techniques known in the art. When peak antibiotic concentration is attained, the antibiotic AR 5 complex may be isolated by extraction as described in the monitoring procedure using about two volumes of immiscible organic solvent per extract and by extracting the broth twice. The extracts are combine, evaporated to a residue and dissolved in methanol. Precipitation of the product by the addition O petroleum ether to the methanol solution yields the antibiotic AR 5 complex.Separation of the antibiotic complex into its components can be effected by chromatography on Sephadex LH 2O. using a concentrate of an ethyl acetate extract.Elution of the bioactive material can be effected with ethanol. The ethanol eluate containing the bioactive fractions is concentrated and absorbed onto a silica gel column. Elution is effected using the previously described chlorofrom, methanol, petroleum ether and water system. The column is monitored by The use of thin layer chromatography using silica gel plates and the solvent system being used to elute the column.Fractions having Rf of 0.51 and 0.43 contain antibioticAR5 1, antibiotic AR5 2, and the corresponding 12, 13 deepoxy l2,l3 dehydro derivatives thereof, designated 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibiotic AR5 1 and 12,13desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibiotic AR5 2. Co produced in the above described fermentation is gentamicin C complex, a well known antibiotic U.S.Patents 3,091,572 and 3,136,704 , which consists of three distinct entities, namely gentamicin C1, gentamicinCla and gentamicin C2. The above described solvent extraction procedure by which the components of antibiotic AR 5 complex are isolated leaves the gentamicin complex in the broth. It can be isolated from the fermentation broth by known techniques such as the following isolation steps acidification of the broth to pH 2.0 e.g. with sulfuric acid , filtration, neutralization of the filtrate with ammonium hydroxide, absorbtion to an IRC 50 resin column in the ammonium cycle, desorbtion of the gentamicin components with dilute ammonium hydroxide, concentration of the eluate and lyophilization.Antibiotic AR5 1, antibiotic AR5 2 and the other compounds of formula I, wherein A together with the carbon atoms of positions 12 and 13 represents an oxirane ring, can be converted to their respective 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro derivative by reduction.This process can be carried out with alkali metal bromides or preferably with alkali metal iodides in an organic acid at above diet temperature. The carboxylic acids preferably contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. This reaction can also be carried out in aromatic hydrocarbons, such as for example benzene, toluene or xylene, containing concentrated hydroiodic acid. Another possibility resides in treating the starting material with phosphorus trialkoxides, trialkyl phosphines, triphenyl phosphines or hexaalkyl phosphoimidates.A Medium for effecting this reaction is potassium iodide in refluxing acetic acid. The reaction product may be advantageously isolated by diluting the reaction mixture with ice water, extracting the product with a water immiscible organic solvent, washing the extract and isolating the product therefrom. The product of this process consists of substantial amounts of both the cis and trans isomers of the reduction product. This reduction process can also be performed in a preferably dilute mineral acid solution containing chromous ions in an inert atmosphere. The reducing agent, i.e. the chromous ions, are advantageously supplied in the form of a solution containing a chromous salt wherein the anion is derived from a n.l ,erEl aid, e.g. chromous chloride, chromous sulfate or chromous iodide. The preferred reducing agent is chromous chloride which may advantageously be prepared by the procedure described in Inorganic Synthesis, Volume III, pages 148 15C, published byMcGraw Hill 1950 . It is preferred that the chromous chloride solution be freshly prepared immediately before use to mitigate against chromic ion formation.The product is rich in the trans isomer and, therefore, does not require chromatographic separation of the isomers. l0,11 Dihydro antibiotic AR5 1 a compound of formula I wherein M is oxo, R is hydrogen,.Z is the group of formula II wherein X is hydroxy and Y is hydrogen, A together with the carbon atoms of positions 12 and 13 is an oxirane ring and B is a single bond between the carbon atoms of positions 10 and 11 is the metabolite of antibiotic AR5 1. It can be obtained by enzymatic, preferably metabolic, reduction of antibiotic AR5 1.Antibiotic AR5 1 can, for example, be fed to animals e.g. dogs capable of reducing it at the double bond between the carbon atoms of positions 10 and 11, and the 10,11 dihydro antibiotic AR5 1 is isolated from the urine of these animals by extraction. The extraction is preferably carried out with water immiscible solvents, such as for example ethylacetate.

The desired product is isolated by adjusting the solution to pH 9.0, followed by extraction, and known cleaning steps.When for example, this process is used for the hydrolysis of 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibioticAR5 1 and or 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibioticAR5 2, the reaction can be carried out with 0.5 N sulfuric acid at about 960C for 5 hours.A preferred method for the preparation of the desmycinosyl compounds compounds of formula I wherein Z is CH2 OH is the hydrolysis of the respective compound of formula I wherein Z is CH20 glycosyl of formula II, wherein Y in combination with X is oxo, by means of methanolic silica gel. For example 4 dehydro 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibiotic AR5 1 preferably the 2 ester, for example 2 acetate thereof is treated with methanolic silica gel at room temperature during 4 days. The desired desmycinosyl 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibiotic AR5 1 is isolated from the reation mixture, e.g. by column chromatography, and is obtained in high yields.The desmycinosyl compounds of the general formula IIIEMI37.1 can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein 2 is CHO, CH2NH2, CH2NHRê, CH2NRêR CH2ORê, CH2OCORê, CH2NHCORê, CH2NR CORê,EMI37.2 CH2O glycosyl excluding CH20 mycinosyl and CR2 0 3 desmethyl mycinosyl , CH2 ureido or CH2 thioureido, wherein fl2 and R3 independent of each other represent an alkyl group containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group containing 7 to 18 carbon atoms or a heterocyclic group containing 3 to 7 carbon atoms and one hetero atom which is sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen, or in the amino groups one of substituents R and R3 is hydrogen and the other is the group CH2 OR orEMI38.1 wherein is an integer of from two to ten, Q is an integer of from 2 to 6 and B is an alkyl group containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group containing 7 to 18 carbon atoms or a heterocyclic group containing 3 to 7 carbon atoms and one hetero atom which is sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen and R5 is 2 hydrogen, R orEMI38.2 The compounds of formula III can be oxidized to the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein Z is CHO and M is oxo. This oxiation can, for example, be carried out by means of the Jones reagent chromic anhydride in dilute sulfuric acid .The compounds of formula III can be subjected to glycoside formation. This glycoside formation is carried out according to known methods, such as reaction of a compound of formula III or a reactive derivative thereof with the appropriate sugar in the presence of a catalyst e.g. 1 HCl and in the absence of water.In particular, the glycosides of this invention may be prepared by the processes set forth in Angew.Chem.Inter national Edition 1974, No.3, pages 157 170 and the references cited therein.

Hydrolysis can for example be carried out in lower alcohol, e.g. methanol . This is explained by the following examples The hydroxy group in positions 2 has the greatest reactivity. The 2 monoesters may be prepared directly by treating the free unesterified antibiotic with a stoichiometric quantity or a slight excess of an acylating agent, such as an acyl halide or an acyl anhydride in the absence of a base at about ambient temperature preferably in a non reactive solvent such as acetone.The reaction is continued for from about 1 to about 20 hours until esterifica tion is substantially complete and followed by isola tion of the 2 monoester from the reaction mixture. The 2 ,4 diesters may be prepared directly by treating the free antibiotics with an excess of acylating agent at about ambient temperature for from about 1 to about 7 days until esterification is substantially complete and isolating the 2 ,4 diester from the reaction mixture.Alternatively, 2 ,4 diesters may be prepared by treating a 2 monoester with an excess of acylating agent under substantially the same conditions described above for direct esterification. This procedure is especially advantageous for preparing mixed esters wherein the desired compound has a different acyl function on each of positions 2 and 4 . The 4 monoester is conveniently prepared by the solvolysis of a 2 ,4 diester,The C 21 hydroxyl being a primary alcohol is esterifiable by acylating agents known in the art. However, in view of the greater reactivity of the 2 hydroxyl in the desosamine moiety, C 21 esters are prepared by indirect methods. For example, by treating the desmycinosyl derivative with an excess of acylating agent such as acetic anhydride in a tertiary ry amine pyridine , the 2 ,21 diester e.g. 2 ,21 dia etate is formea. To obtain the 21 monoester the 2 ,21 diester is subjected to selective solvolysis such as that described in U.S. Patent 4,056,616 issued November 1, 1977 whose disclosure is incorporated by reference herein.In a compound containing hydroxy in positions 2 ,4 and 9 the2 hydroxy group has the highest reactivity. Mono ,di and tri esters can be prepared by appropriate sequence of esterification and hydrolysis steps.If a compound containing a free amino group and one or more free hydroxy groups is subjected to acylation as described above, all these groups can be acylated except the hydroxy group of position 14 . In order to obtain a compound containing free hydroxy group s in position s 9 and or 2 and or 4 the product is subjected to selective hydrolysis by methods which take advantage of the greater stability to hydrolysis of acylamino groups than the acylated hydroxy groups.The esters of this invention are derived from carboxylic acids having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, generally used in the pharmaceutical arts.Embraced by the term are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic including the hemi esters formed with dicarboxylic acids.Examples of suitable acids are acetic, propionic, valeric, stearic, tartaric, maleic, oxalic, maleic malonic, citric, oleic, palmitic, lauric, lactic, fumaric, succinic, cyclopropylcarboxylic, cyclopentylcarboxylic, adamantoic, furic, nicotinic, thenoic, picolinic, benzoin, phenylacetic acid and the like.

Hydrolysis of the individual components established the presence of two sugars, mycinose and desosamine. Both of the sugars have been found to be constituents of other well known antibiotics.However, they have not heretofore been found to be constituents of the same macrolide antibiotic and in the same positions.Physical data for representative compounds of the invention are shown in the following tables 6 to 10.

The group of formula II has the configuration of D mycinose. The same planar formula applies to the derivatives of these compounds disclosed herein.The antibiotics of this invention were subjected to art recognized tests to determine their antibacterial profile. The test methodology and a summary of the results therefrom are set forth hereinbelow.Antibiotic AR5 1, antibiotic AR5 2, their 12,15 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro analogs, erythromicin and rosaramicin have been subjected to the same tests In vitro broth dilution tests MIC s were done in conventional manner using either Mueller Hinton broth gram positive and gram negative bacteria , SabouraudDextrose Broth fungi or Fluid Thioglycollate broth anaerobic bacteria at the appropriate pH, in volumes of 3 5 ml tube. Inocula were obtained by diluting either overr.i tit cultures gram positive and gram negative bacteria and yeasts , 48 hr. cultures anaerobic bacteria , or 4 5 day cultures dermatophytes . Tubes were incubated at 280C dermatophytes , or 37 C grampositive and gram negative bacteria and yeasts , and endpoints were read after 24, 48 and 72 hours.In vitro agar dilution tests were performed usingMueller Hinton agar which was melted prior to use and cooled to approximately 55 C before the addition of suitable volumes of compound solution, to provide twofold serial dilutions. Thirty ml was transferred to 100 x 15 m square Integrid petri dishes and allowed to dry overnight. Plates were inoculated with a SteersFoltz replicating device. Inoculum concentrations were adjusted so that each inoculating rod of the Steers replicator deliveredapproximately 10 viable units of each organism to the agar surface. Inoculated plates were allowed to dry and then incubated at 370C. MIC s were determined after 24 and 48 hours of incubation, The MIC was the lowest concentration at which less than six isolates, discrete colonies were visible.

Only against the final group of macrolide resistant strains did the antibiotics of this invention lose activity.They were active against some anaerobe strains such as B. fragilis andClostrida but did not show the gram negative potency of rosaramicin.In vivo mouse protection tests were performed in male Carworth CF 1 mice weighing 18 20 g each. Infection was effected, with about 107 organisms per mouse or sufficient inocula to cause death of control groups 24 to 148 hours after infection. The infecting organisms included strains of StaphylococcusEnterococcus, ss hemolytic Streptococcus and E. coli.The serum levels of the respective antibiotics were measured in mice rats and dogs. The results were surprising in that the novel antibiotics exhibit therapeutic serum levels considerably longer than erythromycin or rosaramicin. It was also observed that antibiotic AR52 produces peak serum levels earlier th any of the other antibiotics tested, however, antibiotic AR5 1 produces therapeutic serum levels of greater duration. This phenomenon gives substantial support for pharmaceutical dosage forms containing both compounds. This would provide for fewer doses per day without sacrificing the therapeutic effect.

Unlike erythromycin and rosara micin, with one exception, the compounds of this inven tion appear to have equal potencies orally and subcuta neously.In general antibiotic AR5 1 and 12,13 desepoxy 12,13 dehydro antibiotic AR5 1 were 30 40 fold more potent orally then erythromycin and rosaramicin. The acute toxicity determinations were carried out with groups of male Carworth CF 1 mice weighing 18 20 g. LD50 values the dose that was lethal to 50 of the mice were calculated by probit analysis based on the number of survivors at 24 and 48 hours after dosing.

The compounds may thus be used in the treatment of warm blooded animals suffering from diseases caused by such organisms, The absorption is better than of similar macrolide antibiotics. The compounds may also be used for in vitro purposes as disinfectants for laboratory glassware, dental and medical equipment. The antibiotics of this invention may be administered toFically, parenterally and orally, preferably in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical carriers and excipients.The dosage forms, excluding topicals, should be designed to permit the administration of from about 5 to about 50 mg per kg per day. Topical formulations should be applied to the affected areas from about 2 to about 4 tines a day and should contain from about 5 to 15, preferably about 10, grams per liter for lotions and c qu I quantity per kilogravl for cintmel.ts. However, it should be realized that many factors such as for example the age and general physical condition of the patient, the nature of the infecting organism influence the precise dosage of a medicament to be administered.The antibacterial compounds of this invention may be dispensed in the form of for example capsules, tablets, elixirs and as injectable solutions and suspensions.Formulations may contain one or more of the antibiotics of this invention.In tests with mamals it has been determined that antibiotic AR5 2 reaches a peak serum level earlier than antibiotic AR5 1 by subcutaneous or oral routes, whereas antibiotic AR5 1 gives peak serum levels which persist substantially longer than those of antibioticAR5 2. Thus a combination dosage has the advantage of an early and prolonged peak serum level.A preferred combination is a pharmaceutical dosage form containing 30 to 60 preferably 40 to 50 of one of antibiotic AR5 1 and antibiotic AR5 2 in dosage form in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical excipients, wherein the remainder of the ar.tibacterially active material is the other of antibiotic AR5 1 and antibioticAR5 2.
