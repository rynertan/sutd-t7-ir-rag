# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE DISPLAY OF VIDEO SIGNAL INFORMATION

## Abstract
A video signal display control method and apparatus pro vide the display control functions for both CRT type display devices 5 and LCD type or other similar display devices 8 to be attached as output display units to an external microcom puter or other control systems 1 that provides output video signals 2 . The display controller contains computer program codes for processing the output video signals 2 and permit ting video signal information to be presented on a scaled up size, on a scaled down size, or as a partially extracted informa tion on the physical screen of the display devices 5,8 . The li mitations on the performance of the external microcomputer 1 imposed by the inherent performance of the display devi ces 5, 8 have thus been eliminated, allowing for the optimum use of the microcomputer performance.
