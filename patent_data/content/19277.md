# A process for detecting the presence of an antigen in a specimen.

## Abstract
A process for detecting the presence of an antigen in a specimen is described, which process comprises A contacting said specimen with a substrate coated with antibodies of said antigen, incubating the contacted substrate and washing the substrate B contacting the washed material of step A with a hapten conjugated antibody against said antigen, incubating the so contacted material and washing the so incubated material C contacting the washed material of step B with a radioactive material labeled or enzyme containing antihapten antibody, incubating the so contacted material and washing the same and D effecting radioimmunoassay if said antibody is radioactive or enzyme labeled immunoassay if said antibody contains an enzyme moiety. Quantitative determination of the antigen in the specimen is effected by comparing the counts of the radioimmunoassay or the concentration of enzyme against a standard as by photocolormetric methods.
