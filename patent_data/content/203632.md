## Description
This invention relates to a catalyst for the selective decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide into phenol and acetone, and to the use of said catalyst for that decomposition reaction. Conventionally, cumene is peroxidated to cumene hydroperoxide, and the latter is decomposed by the agency of an acidic catalyst, which is sulphuric acid such a procedure produces phenol and acetone, but accompanied by acetophenone and sulphonated by products which pollute the desired products and are difficult to separate.
