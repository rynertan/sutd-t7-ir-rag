# Resilient drive for fuel injection pump governors.

## Abstract
A resilient drive for a fuel injection pump governor comprising a resilient coupling 76, 92, 96 connecting the governor speed sensing mechanism 38 to the governor shaft 28 . In a preferred embodiment, the governor fly weight assembly 38 is rotatably mounted with respect to the governor shaft 28 and is connected thereto by a resi lient coupling 76, 92, 96 which permits the limited momen tary rotation of the flyweight assembly with respect to the shaft to dampen torsional vibrations.
