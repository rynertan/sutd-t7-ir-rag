## Description
Furniture Drawers This invention relates to furniture drowers and to components for use in constructing drawers. Proposals have been mode for drawers consisting of wall panels hinged together so that they con be pockaged and sold in a generally flat condition and then assembled to form the drawer, catch means being provided to watch the purts in their assembled positions at 900 to one another. Hitherto such catch means have been provided internolly of corner piece parts which are located at the hinged regions, the catch mains then being hidden. However such arrongements suffer from a number of disadvantages. The moulds required in order to make the catch means are complex, and scrap material trimming can be difficult and time consuming. Also, the size of the catch means is limited which makes it difficult to achieve reliable latching action, and the catches are susceptible to breakage. It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate some or all of these disadvantages. The invention provides a device for interconnecting drawer wall panels, the device comprising two hÅangedly inter , connected parts respectively connectlble to adacent drawer wall panels, and catch means for retaining said parts in positions at right angles to one another, the catch means comprising at least one external end cap carried by one of said parts and resiliently engageable with a complementary retaining member on the other port. Preferably similar catch means are provided at the upper and lower ends of the associaeed part. Preferably said parts co operate to form a hollow corner post which is of rectangular shope in plan and remains exposed after assembly of the wall panels, said end cÅap forming an end closure for said post in the assembled condition. Preferably also the, or each said end cap is formed with a downturned lip at its free end adcpted for locking engagement with the associated retaining member. The outer surface of said lip may be curved to conform to the curvature of the edges of the wall panels in appropriate cases, An embodiment of the invention wili now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of part of a drawer system using folding corner pieces embodying the inventionrprior to assembly Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a corner piece used inFig. 1 in its assembled condition and Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are front, top and bock views respectively of the corner piece of Fig. 2 opened out. Referring to Fig. 1, there are shown two sections 10,, 12 of drawer wall panel formed from extruded plastics matesiol. the former to represent a drawer side much shortened fox illustration only and the latter to represent a drawer back.The drawer side 10 is engageable with a front connector 14 at its forward end for attachment to a drawer front, ond a folding corner piece 16 is engogeable with the rear end of the pnel lO for connection with the drawer back panel 12. The panels 10, 12 are each provided on their inner surfaces 20 with longitudinal recesses 21 near their lower edgesto receive the edges of a drawer bottom, and the outer surface 22 of each panel is centrally recessed at 23 to receive a runner or a slide mechanism by means of which the drawer ia slidably supported in c cabinet or the like. Extending between the foces 2D, 22 of the panels are webs 27 displaced from the recesses 23, and webs 28 near etch end of the base 26 of the recess. Between the webs 28 is a narrow cavity 29. The front connector 14 hos a front plote 31 notched o,t 32 and 33 to register with the drawer bottom recess 21 regardless of which side wall it closes. The front plate 31 Carries spigot like extensions 34, 35 near its ends which ore of open box form. The base web 36 of each extension is inset from the adjacent edge of the plate 31 by subutontially the thickness of the external wall 22 of the drawer panel, and extends at 39 beyond the side webs 38. The free end of each extension 34, 35 is broken away at 40 to accommodate the drawer bottom recess 21.The base 36 of each extension 34, 35 has a small exterior stud or projection 41 with a chamfered fonçard edge 42 Figs. 3 and 4 to ease its passage into the drawer extrusion before engagement thereof in a matching hole or recess not visible in the exterior wall 22 of the extrusion. The ends of the side walls 37, 38 of the extensions 34, 35 are chamfered to e,ase entry into the extrusion. The front plats 31 has holes 43 through interior bosses 44 to aid fixing to a drawer front using self tapping screws or threaded studs and nuts. An inwardly directed flat tongue 45 is adapted to engoge in the covity 29 of the extrusion behind the runner recess 23. The folding corner piece 16 see also Figs, 3 to 5 has two ports or leaves 50, 51 hinged one to the other by a thinning of the plastics material between the two parts by means of a V notch 52. The two ports together constitute Q corner post and are each of generally angle section having spoced upstanding walls 55, 56 braced by right triangular bracing webs 57, 58 flanking recesses 60, 61 which register with the runner recesses 23 in the wall panels. The webs 58 abut in the assembled position of the corner piece in which the hinged ports 50 and 51 are disposed at 900 to one another.The free edge of the upstanding wall 5,6 of the part 50 is stepped at 62 to receive the free edge of the upstanding wall 55 of the port 50 and thus produce a strong box like structure or corner past on folding of the hinge leaves together with the edges 62, 63 end bracing webs 57, 58 in abutment. The upstanding walls 55, 56 each carry upper and lower spigot like projections, the lower profeationt 65 being identical to the pro3ections 34, 35 of the d awer front connector 14 and having associated slots 66 to accommodate, the drawer bottom,and the upper pre jections 67 also being identical save for a full end closure wall 68. Al so shown are tongues 69 similar to the tongues 45 of the front connector. Resilient end caps 72 project from the upper and lower ends of the upstanding wall 56 of the, leaf or part 51 and extend towards the other leaf 50. The end caps 72 have in turned lips 73 affording a rodiussed outer surface 74 to match the radiussed corners of the wall panels. Locking projections or ears 76 project from the wall 55 of the other leaf 50 and are inset relotive to ttie end caps 72 so as to fit thereunder when the leaves 50 and 51 are moved to their assembled position.During such movement the end caps 72 are flexed optwärds as the lips 73 slide over the locking ears 76 and then spring inwards to lotch over the edges 77 of the ears. The ears 76 are inset at 78 from te free edge of the wall 55 to provide a further abutment against the side edges of the end caps 72 in the folded condition. These sic,e edges may thus be of greater thickness than the matching parts of the wall panels. In the arrangement described the end caps 72 are each attached at one edge to the wall 53 of the leaf 51 but they may be free of the wbll 53 to facilitate flexing if desired.However this is not essential so long as the material used is of sufficient flexibility. In some caves the ears 70 moy have tapered or otherwise inclined outer surfaces toossist engagement so thot the extent of resilient deformotion of the end caps 72 reduces from its free corner 80 inwards towards the wall 53. The arrangement described provides a simple and effective means of locking the hinged parts of the connector together and hence retaining the walls of the drawer at right angles to one another. The assembled connector is of neat appearance and requires less complex and expensive tooling than previously proposed arrangements. Various modi.fications may be made without departing from the invention. For example the construction of the wnli panels and of the front and corner connector may be altered substantially and the invention could be applied. to drawer co.nstructions vtilizing solid wall panels having openings in their ends to receive spigots, dowels or other svitable projections on the connectors. Any suitable number and arrangement of such projections inoy be provided and if desired the external e,nd cap locking arrangement muy be supplemented by locking meons arranged internally of the corner connectors.
