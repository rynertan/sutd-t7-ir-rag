# Pronunciation showing type faces.

## Abstract
Technical field The application of linguistics to publish ing. Technical features Chinese characters cannot show pronunciation, neither can English letters show pronuncia tion exactly. To know their pronunciation, we have to de pend on phonetic symbols or letters for Chinese, there are Chinese phonetic letters, both old and new for English, there are many sets of symbols, of which the international phonetic symbols and Webster s are the most widely used . But these symbols or letters can only be used in dic tionaries, not suitable for textbooks or readers of any kind. Some Chinese publications have phonetic letters printed between lines, thus causing much trouble both to printing and reading, and so have failed to be widely accepted. Pronunciation showing type faces can show pronunciation through letters or characters themselves, characterized as follows For the Chinese characters, a set of stroke letters have been designed to represent the initial consonant, the yunmu and the tone, and these stroke letters are set in Chinese characters to show their pronunciation. For the English letters, there are two methods. The first is that a letter with a variety of possible pronunciations is marked heavier in different parts to show its different pronuncia tions, but with its original form unchanged. The second is that the vowel letters are classified and given classifying marks to show different pronunciations. The English letters after treatment by the above methods are capable of show ing an accurate pronunciation. Uses The invented type faces may be used to publish both Chinese and English textbooks and readers of all kinds, which will facilitate a fine command of the pronunciation of the two languages and will facilitate the memorizing of new words of English as well.

## Claims
Claims 1. Some written languages faii to show pronunciation or fail to show pronunciation with accuracy. One of the usual solutions of this problem is to design a new writing system to replace the old one, and both the original letters and spellings have to be transformed, which can hardly be widely accepted.Our p,resent invention is not writing systems but type faces which can show pronunciation with great accuracy and, what is more significant, require no painstaking efforts on tne part of millions of people accustomed to the existing writing system to get used to the new type faces, because the original letter forms and spellings in the case of English , and the original character structures in the case of Chinese are kept unchanged. The invention consists of a set of English pronunciation showing type faces and a set of Chinese pronunciation showing type faces, characterized in that English letters in Draft I of the English pronunciation showing type faces or Chinese characters are made to show pronunciation with great accuracy by marking heavier different parts of a letter in the case of English or by marking heavier the inserted stroke letters in the case of Chinese which form the three strokes representative of the initial consonant, the yunmua and the tone of a Chinese character. 2. Various sets of additional marks have been designed to render such phonetic writing system as English capable of showing pronunciation with great accuracy, but all of these sets of marks, which seem similar to our second draft of Englihs pronunciation showing type faces simplified as Draft It , have the defect of being too clumsy. Draftees an extremely economic set of additional marks, characterzed as follows 1 Instead of providing a respective mark for diffrent vowels, a certain class of vowels is olven only one mark, which can show their respective pronunciation. This day of marking is based on our classification of the pronunciation of all vowel letters, single vowel letters and letter combinations pronounced as single vowels are classified into l compound sound , long vowel , 1short vowel round and unwound and various kinds of 1weak vowel vowels that go one after another ln a particular woro are classified into unit of two successive vowels , unit of three successive vowels , and unit of four successive vowels 1 . ThatXs why the total number of marks provided in this draft can be reduced to a minimum. 2 stressed strong vowel , unstressed strong vowel , unstressed weak vowel and stressed wea vowel are four new concepts established in Drafty the unstressed weak vowels in a word are left unmarked and the determination of their pronunciation may appeal to reading rules. This is one of our ways to reduce the number of marks used in a word to a minimum. 3 Successive vowel letters in a particur word pronounced as two or more successive vowels are usually nade to show their pronunciations with two or more marks1 the number of which equals that of the vowels. In Draft 1T , the successive vowels are taken as one unit and needs only one mark which can indicate the number of vowels contained in the pronunciation of these successive vowel letters, and the position of which can tell whether these successive vowels are one compound vowel or several single vowels. With these two points made clear, the pronunciation of these successive vowel letters can thus be ascertained. This is another way of reducing the marks used in a word to a minimum. 4 One mark in Draftitmay have several different uses, e.g. the mark for a stressed strong vowel indicates the position of the stressed syllable,shows its pronunciation and helps to determine the pronunciation of those unmarked syllables in the same word. This is the third way to reduce the marks used iA a word to a minimum.

## Description
PRONUNCIATION SHOWING TYPE FACESThe divorce of pronunciation from letters is a problem cam mon to all languages, especially to Chinese and English.Chinese characters are not phonetic by origin. English, though phonetic letters, is nevertheless incapable of showing pronunciation accurately. To learn writing systems of such languages, phonetic transcriptions are indispensable. Transcriptions can only be applied in dictionaries, they are not suitable fdr readers of any kind. For example, some Chinese text books have transcriptions interlined, thus causing a lot of inconvenience in the process of printing and reading.By the end of the 19th century, a number of Chinese scholars had already made initial efforts towards the reform of the old Chinese writing system and the popularization of new ones. During the last 30 years or so, the reform has been firmly supported all along by the government. However, even now, it cannot progress substantially. The distinguished British writer, Bernard Shaw, advocated energetically the replacement of the existing English writing system by a new alphabet and new ways of spelling. He even dedicated part of his legacy to the English writing system reform. But so far, very little progress, if any, has been made.Histories of all the writing system reformations carried out whether in China, or in other countries, tell that it is almost impossible for big, culturally developed countries to adopt a new writing system by wholly abolishing the old one, because such a change would inevitably impose a change on the habits of millions of people formed through long years. This does not mean that no change at all is admitted.There are two forms of letters, the handwritten and the printed. It is quite possible to make appropriate alterations in the printed form. Lots of printed forms have been designed, however, these designs were made just to give letters an artsitic look. Ours serve a different purpose. They are intended to show pronunciation, and are named pronunciationshowing type faces . ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION SHOWING TYPE FACES Draft I Showing Pronunciation through Letter. Phoneme UnitsThe research of rules governing the pronunciation of English words can hardly result in the solution of the problem, if our attention is directed to only the letters or only the sounds. Both letters and sounds must be taken into consideration simultaneously as two related aspects of one object, inseparable from each other. For example, the letter e has four different pronunciations i , e , , l and therefore, four different letter.phoneme units are formed e i , e e , e , e l .The sound l is the pronunciation of four different letters e, i, y, a, and there are accordingly four different letter.phoneme units eels , i 1 , y l , a l . Though pronounced in the same way, all the four have their own respective reading rules, different from each other, that should be studied separately.In actual words, a letter that may be pronounced in several ways is marked heavier on different parts so as to show its different pronunciations silent letters are represented by fine lines.

The weakening of consonants often coincides with that of vowels. Therefore, the pronunciation of consonants can be determined by the weakening of the preceding or following vowels. a When a, c, , ea is pronounced , the preceding consonant s , c or t is pronounced as and x as k . b When i is pronounced and followed by a vowel, the t or c preceding it is pronounced J3 c When e, is pronounced , the t , s and z that precede these letter combinations are pronounced as fol lows t as t , s as and z or as d When ion is pronounced n , the preceding is pronounced 3 e When u is prnounced , the preceding x is pronounced k . Where there is no weakening of the above mentioned vowel letter combinations, there is no weakening of consonants. For example, Srci ty s sa f When pronounced , u is a weak vowel to soe extent.Only the consonant s t Ii or d will get weakened if followed by this u s is pronounced as , t as tell , d as d , C but t and d can also keep its unweakened pronunciaton tj and dj 1 . 3 c is pronounced k when followed by a, o, u, or by other consonants, or standing at the end of a word. It is pronounced s when followed by e, i, y. Consonant letters that have only one pronunciation each b b , f f , h h , j d , k k , l l , m m , p p , q k , v i . Some of them, however, have pronunciational exceptions.For instance, of is uttered v , and the suffix ed is pronounced t instead of I , if preceded by a voiceless consonant except t . The solution of these prohlems can he found in reading rules and so no special transcriptions are provided.7.

Some of the letters which have pronunciational exceptions in certain words are given no special transcriptions, because they exist only in a very small number of words. all the letters in these words are represented in fine strokes.

The stress rules for double stressed words are too complicated to remember. Therefore,the rear stress mark is put on the sesond stress so that the first stress can remain unmarked. For example, hel with h w In words that have both primary and secondary stresses the position of the secondary stress can be determined by that of the primary one and needs no marking either. After trearment by themathod provided in this draft, i.e. showing pronunciation by letter phoneme units, the word stress is mostly found in a regular position. An irregularly stressed syllable is made to carry a stress mark on its vowel. 10. The ey factor that determines stresses is the stressed syllable s position and its shift . A disyllabic word has ts stress on the last syllable but one. A polysyllabic word has its stress on the last syllable but two. These two positions are designated stress positions . If a weak syllable is found on the stress position, there occurs the shift of stress, for a weak syllable cannot be a stress. 11. A syllable which has a weak vowel or a weak consonant is a weak syllable. 1 Weak vowels a Vowels that are all pronounced a, e, i, o, u, y ou, oa, ua... ar, er, or, ir, ur, yr, our, ure... ia, ie, io b a , e , i c u ju d ia , ie , io , iu , iou 2 Weak consonants a t , s , c , x k sh is not a weakened sound and cannot be included in this group. b z , fJ ci tttj ch t Wis not a weakened sound, and cannot be included in this group. d d d , j d isn t a weakened sound, and can not be included in this group . 3 ktith no vowel taking part, the consonant 1 , m or n may form a weak syllable with another consonant.12.

Notes to Tables I and It 1 Some Concepts a Strong vowel a vowel that exists either in a stressed syllable or in an unstressed one.b Weak vowel a vowel existing only in an unstressed syllable,However, some weak vowels may be in stressed syllables in the following condition the vowels of the syllables of a word are all weak ones. For example, usually etl can only be found in an 4nstressed syllable, but in a special case, it may be a stress. For example, England i gl nd c Stressed vowel a vowel existing in the stressed syllable of a word. A secondary stress is deemed not to be a stressed vowel.d Unstressed vowel a vowel existing in an unstressed syllable of a word. A secondary stress is deemed to be an unstressed vowel.Only in an actual word, can the distinction between a stressed vowel and an unstressed one be found existing. Apart from it, it would be impossible to differentiate one from the other, because neither of them is something substantial if separated from an actual word. But the distiction between a strong vowel and a weak one stands independent. of an actual word.In actual words, the above two pairs of concepts form four kinds of vowels a Stressed strong vowel a strong vowel which exists in a stressed syllable.b Unstressed strong vowel a strong vowel which exists in an unstressed syllable.c Unstressed weak vowel a weak vowel which exists in an unstressed syllable.d Stressed weak vowel a weak vowel which, in some special cases, exists in the stressed syllable of a word the weak vowel can never be a stress . 2 When preceded by a vowel letter, w is deemed to be a non independent vowel . And so is r , if preceded by a vowel letter and pronounced taz. 3 u , when pronounced rju J, is made up of a semi vowel and a vowel , and so classified into compound sounds. In American pronunciation, r r consists of a non independent vowel and an ending consunant, and so placed into compound sounds, too. Compound vowels are included in compound sounds. 4 Table I includes al the pronunciations of single vowel letters pronounced as single vowels, compound vowels or other compound sounds. b the pronunciations of vowel letter combinations pronounced as single vowels. But those vowel letter combinations that are pronounced as compound vowels are not put into this group. 5 Vowel section The vowel letters between two consonants are named vowel section .A vowel section may consist of only one vowel or several successive vowels. In some cases, a word is made up of one vowel section with no consonants at one or either end. For example a, eye, at, do. A vowel section is usually given only one mark to be placed on one of its letters. For example, dày de . 6 r iS silent, if a long vowel,a a , , a , old precedes and no vowel follows. For example, árm a m , wàr w , f r f , f ur f . In American pronunciation, these long vowels become short and r is voiced. For example, arm arm , wàr w r , for f r , f ur f r . See Table III 7 The single letter o is pronounced D1 when given a round short vowel mark l g II is pronounced . The same mark shows that the letter combination oo 11 is pronounced rul o or o is pronouncad B Any vowel that is pronounced as an unstressed weak vowel is unmarked. But such a vowel letter has usually more than one pronunciation and therefore needs the following rules to dif ferentiate them. a generally pronounced . When followed by a consonant with a silent e after it, a is pronounced I . For example, v llage v l d . e mostly pronounced . In a prefix, it is pronounced I .For example, decide d sa d . In a suffix it is pronounced 113 or . For example, dárkness da kn s but when followed by n , it is pronounced only. For example, developmentEMI18.1 i generally pronounced I . In a word of three or more syllables, the i of the middle syllable may either be LiJ or . For example. hòlidy h l d . y generally pronounced t 13. In a word of three or more syllables, the y of the middle syllable is pronounced . For example, làbyrinth l b r n . o o has only one pronounciation, that is t . In some cases, o used to be pronounced o , but now o has been placed by 193. u mostly pronounced . In a word of three or four syllables, the u of the middle syllable is pronounced j or example, pòpular p pj l the same u is pronounced U , if preceded by r1 or j , for example, i nstrumentt inStrumnt the same u is pronounced , if the middle syllable ends in the consonant 1 , m or n , with no vowel following immediately. For example, consultation k ns l e n , volun tary l n r . 9 The weak vowel in a stressed syllable is marked, or exam ple, pretty pr t . English ggl . 5. A regularly silent vowel or consonant is unmarked1 e.g. knife na f , k,e are silent .An irregularly silent vowel or consonant is marked with a dot under it, e.g. wèdnesday wenzd , or represented in fine strokes.6. In some words, the vowel with an irregular pronunciation which cannot be found in the vowel classification table may be given the special mark D for a stressed vowel or D for an unstressed one. For example, any en . These words can also be represented entirely by fine strokes so as to indicate the impossibility of their transcription.7.

The leer combinations pronounced as unstressed single weal vowelsType er in Table I is a letter combination pronounced as an unstressed weak vowel. Besides Type er , there are some other letter combinations pronounced as unstressed weak vowels, which may be divided into two groups single vowels and compound vowels. Following is the table of the letter combinations pronounced as unstressed single weak vowels. Table M Letter Combination Pronunciation Example ay Sùnday s nd I ey vàlley vael ai mountain maunt n ei I sòvereign s vr n ui biscuit b sk t ou humourous h u m r s oa waistcoat wesk t ua unusual nju l Notes to TableThe unstressed weakvawels in the Table may be pronounced in two ways, either I or . The two different pronunciations have to be distinguished from each other by the use of a certain type of letter combinations, because the unstressed weak vowels are generally unmarked. 1 The letter combination ended by y is prnounced . Since its second letter is y , the first one cannot be y or i neither o , for cy can only be pronounced as the di phthong , and must be marked see Table V . The usual English vowel arrangement conditions there are only two combinations for this type ay and ey . 2 The letter combinations ended by i is pronounced I or . Since its second letter is i , for the same reason as above, this type has only the following combinations ai , ei , ui . 3 The letter combinations without a terminal i or y is pronounced 1 a 10. Successive Vowels An English compound vowel is composed of either two or three sounds, ended by any of the following weak vowels , U , L U3. The initial sound is pronounced with stress. Sometimes several vowels go together, one after another, but they are not of the same arrangement as usual English compound vowels.For example, piano p aen , i ae in this word is made up of two successive vowels initiation ,n e n , ia e is composed of a single vowel plus a diphthong, i.e. three successuve vowels biotachnology ba ek n l d , io a u is composed of two diphthongs, i.e. four successive vowels.We name these phenomena respectively unit of two successive vowels 11 unit of three successive vowels and unit of four successive vowels . As regards letter combinations, those pronounced as compound vowels are classified into different units of successive vowels in accordance with the number of their vowels. the diphthongs, e , , , a , e , , a . EU , are deemed as units of two successive vowels the compound vowels of three sounds, a , a , e , , u ,are taken as units of three successive vowels. Besides, the vowels made up of the semi vowel j Vowel, ju , ju , are deemed to be units of two successive vowels, too.A unit of successive vowels may be a compound vowel or a group of several successive vowels. In written form,it is made up of twoor,more letters in pronunciation, it comprises two or more vowels. Compound vowels are also deemed to be units of successive vowels, except those that are represented by single vowel letters. a e , i a , y a , o , u ju ,, u ju classified as compound sounds in Table I, are not units of successive vowels. There are three kinds of units of successive vowels a unit of two successive vowels, a unit of three successive vowels, a unit of four successive vowels.The mark for a unit of two successive vowels stressed 0 unstressed U The mark for a unit of three successive vowels stressed 0 unstressed öA unit of four successive vowels may be shown either with two marks for a unit of two successive vowels or with a mark for a single vowel and that for a unit of three successive vowels.11.

Since the single letter e is in no case pronounced as a compound vowel, the mark can be used to be placed on the e in the unit ere or eir to show the compound vowel La . 50 it is prescribed in the table that re or ir is pronounced e . 2 The r between two vowels is sometimes pronounced r . For example, h ro h r u . P ,nd sometimes Lr 3 . For example, herald her ld . This distinction is shown by the mark on the vowel before r . In h rô , i is the mark for a unit of two successive vowels, indicating what lies under it is a letter combination pronounced as a unit of successive vowels. Therefore, on one hand, r , together with e , forms the unit of successive vowels er , in which r is pronounced L on the other, as a consonant, it is linked in pronunciation to the next vowel o .In hèrald , b is the mark for a single vowel, indicating that the e under it is pronounced as a single vowel, and nr acts only as a consonant, linked in pronunciation to the next vowel.12. There are two kinds of units of two successive vowels compound vowel letter combinations and non compound vowel letter combinations. The former is marked on the front part the latter on the back. But a small number of non compound vowel letter combinations are marked on the front part, too, if the front vowel is a stressed syllable, eg. rúin ru n In order to make it easier to ascertain their pronunciations, the types of letter combinations in Table V pronounced as units of two successive vowels are put into the following groups 1 With the mark on the front part a ...é...

There are two kinds of units of three successive vowels 1 a unit with a weak vowel in the back part simplified as a weak hack unit The back part is a weak vowel or I the front part is a compound vowel of two sounds, i , ei , u , u , i , ju , ju 2 a unit with a strong vowel in the back part simplified as a strong hack unit The back parts a strong vowel,This vowel may be such compound vowels as left, u ,etc, or s strong single vowel, , , , e , i , etc. If there is a compound vowel in the back part, the vowel in the front part must be a single one. If a single vowel exists in the back part, the front part is invariably occupied b a compound vowel and the single vowel must be a stress.The mark positions for a weak back unit of three successive vowels, the mark o is placed on the front part for a strong back unit of three successive vowels, the mark is placed on the back part.17. The letter combination types of the weak back units of three successive vpwels are put into groups as follows 1 ... , ... The front part is i or y the back part may be r or a letter combination with r in it, or may be a, e, o, u , but never i, y . The whole unit is pronounced nasal 2 ... including ay the back part may be r or a letter combination with r in it, or may be e, o , but never a, i, y, u .

The front part is ow the back part is a letter combination with r in it. Since this group is the same with group 4 in form, the distinction between the two has to be shown by the position of mark. That s why is placed on w instead of o . 6 o The front part is o and the back part is o , too. Since it is a weak back unit, the back non being pronounced c the front o is of course pronounced as the compound vowel u . The whole unit is pronounced u . 7 oi The front part is 0 the back part can only be i . The whole unit is pronounced u . 8 y... he front part is oy the back part may be r or a letter combination with rtl in it or a , but never i, y, u . The whole unit is pronounced I . 9 ... ... , e ... The front part is u , you or ew the back part is sometimes r or a latter combination with r in it, sometimes a, e, u, ou . The whole unit is pronounced ju . In a stressed syllable, it may be pronounced ju in some cases.If a unit of this group is ended by i , its pronunciation is all but in a stressed syllable, sometimes it is pronounced ju I , and may also be ju or ju . 1B.The letter combination types of strong back units of three successive vowels are put into two groups The first group the back part is a compound vowel of two sounds and the front part a single vowel.The second group the back part is a single vowel the front part a compound vowel of two sounds.It s difficult to distinguish one group from the other by judging from the letters. The mark position is therefore used to make the difference. If the back part of a strong back unit is a single vowel, the mark is placed right on it if it is a compound vowel, the mark is placed a little after it.For example, initiation InI I eI n . In letter combinations of strong back units, except e , all the vowel letters may be pronounced in two ways a i I , LeJ o u , u ju sometimes ju , u or Take ia . If this combination is marked as is , it shows that a is pronounced so i must be I and i is pro nounced I . If ia is marked as ia , it shows that a is pronounced eI so i must be CI3 and ia is pronounced IeI . Take in for another example. If it is mark ed as io , it is pronounced I u . As the pronunciation of the letter u , the compound vowel thus may sometimes be replaced by Lju . When ufl is pronounced as a single vowel, there may be two pronunciations for it as the front part, it is pronounced U as the back part, . When u is the front part, u shows a is pronounced , u ju , and ua ju . ua shows a is pronounced eI , u u and ua ueI .When u is the back part, iu shows u is pronounced , so i must be I and i is pronounced I . As the back part, e is pronounced e , But ee , as the back part, is pronounced i , so the front part oy must be and oyee is pronounced i Those vowel sections of three sounds that go beyond the above classified types cannot be shown with the mark for units of three successive vowels. For example, koala k u l . u looks like a strong back unit, but in fact it is not.For as a single vowel, the a in a strong back unit of three successive vowels can only be pronounced instead of Ca . Therefore, this word cannot be marked with . It should be marked like this koála k u l . 19. Units of four successive vowels There are only a small number of units of four successive vowels and so no special mark has been designed for them. They are shown with the marks for single vowels and for units of two and three successive vowels. For a unit of four successive vowels is nothing more than two units of two successive vowels or a unit of three successive vowels plus a single vowel. For example, biotechnology b I utek n l d I , situation sItju eI n . situation may also be pronounced sIt eI n . eI , a unit of three successive vowels, may be marked with fl . So this word may be marked like this situation.20. For students of English with some command of English reo ing rulers, it is unnecessary to mark regularly pronounced words. For example Open .Sy llable Closed SyllableLetter Fronunciation Ecample Pronunciation Example a CJi late glad w wand e i he e ten i like LI z sit y L1J hy o u no not u ju tune sun j ,l ,r u June blue trueIrregular words have to he marked.For example, hàva h v , g ve gIv , trúth tru . 21. The total number of marks provided in Draft Ii amounts to nine pairs, which fall into a respective group for the stressed syllables and the unstressed ones. To economize on the marks, the author suggests to choose half, i.e. nine of the total, for use. The chosen marks are listed below compound sound long vowel I long vowel IL short vowel I ò short vowel ar D weak vowel I El weak vowel II unit of two successive vowels . unit of three successive vowels Word stress is shown with a dot placed on the mark, e.g. o The usage of this stress mark, i.e. the dot, is the same as the usage of the stress mark provided in Draft I See pages 11 13, Section II , Draft I . If the position of word stress keeps in agreement with the rules expounded in Section II ,Draft I, the dot showing stress may be omitted. The two drafts are based on the same thesis about English reading rules that the pronuncition of vowel and consonant letters is closely connected with the stress position, and the change in the pronunciation of consonant letters coincides with that in the pronunciation of vowel letters. The application of the thesis to practice has resulted in the two drafts. The first one is from sounds to stress, and the second from stress to sounds. The former is suitable for children and the latter is more extensively applicahle. CHINESE PRONUNCIATION SHOWING TYPE FACES 1. Every character retains its original strokes and structure.Out of each character, three strokes are chosen to represent its initial consonant, yunmu and tone.The pronunciation of a Chinese character, a Chinese syllable, may be divided into two parts ns engmun and yunmu . The former is an initial consonant the latter a single or compound vowel, sometimes a single or compound vowel plus the terminal consonant Ifl or rl . Not every Chinese syllable has an initial consonant. A syllable without the initial consonant is called a non initial consonant syllable. Every Chinese syllable var ies.in pitches. The changes in pitch are known as its tones.2.Whenever possible, the initial consonant is represented by a vertical stroke and the yunmu by a horizontal one. When there is no obvious vertical or horizontal stroke to be chosen, a slanting or point stroke may be the substitute. A horizontal stroke can not represent the initial consonant, neither can a vertical one the yunmu . But both the slanting and the point strokes can represent either the initial consonant or the yunmu . If one of the two strokes representative of the initial consonant and the yunmu is vertical or horizontal one and the other a slanting or point one, what the latter repro sents has to be decided by what the former does if the former is used to show the initial consonant, the latter the yunmu or vice versa. If the two strokes are both slanting or point strokes, it is the order of strokes observed in calligraphy that decides which represents which.The tone is represented by a stroke at the lower part on the right.The strokes that represent the initial consonant, the yunmu and the tone are named stroke letters. 3. The designs for stroke letters 1 Initial consonantsChinesePhonetic Stroke Reason. for Design Alphahet Letter p m t similar to the first half of H f f f with the horizontal stroke missing d t 1 similar to n 1 similar to the first half of n 11 1 I similar to L g 1 similar to G 1C is taken off k and put under the vertical stroke h , a little different from h j J j with the dot missing q x f the first half of x with a downward verti cal stroke. z t z is first changed into and then its upper half is taken. c l C with an upward vertical stroke. s t s is first changed into and then its upper half is taken. zh I The vertical stroke is thickened, because the initial consonant of is zh . ch J similar to sh the other half of the changed s r similar to gamma Note linen used in a short stroke, x f may be written as and c as C . it and are the short form of x and c . 2 Yunmu a Single Vowels Chinese Stroke Reason for Design Phonetic Letter Alphabet a e,o i In Chinese, the character is pronoun ced i u is similar to the straightened form of the letter . ü er The Arabic numeral 2 is pronounced èr in Chinese and , is the straightened form of 2 . Note Besides, there s a short form for some stroke letters. When used in short strokes, u and i may be writ ten like this , u and i b Compound Vowels and Compound Vowels with a Terminal Con sonant Yunmu To make them easier to memorise, these yunmu are arranged into several groups of four Group 1 Yunmu Reason far Design ei ie The half ring upon the horizontal line re presents e , because e can be extended ai ia into . The half ring under the hori zonatl line represents a , because t is extended from a . The horizontal line represents i . Group 2 Yunmu Reason for Design ute i i o u uai iauThe horizontal line represents i , the arc itself represents u and its different positions show some other vowels.Its position on the line indicates e,o the two vowels are of the same Phoneme in Chinese when it is under the line , a is indicated.Group 3 uo ou ua auThe horizontal line performs no more function than that of an axis, showing not a single sound. The arc itself represents u and its different positions indicate some other vowels. When it is on the line, o is indicated its position under the line shows a .Its presence at the head of the line indicates u is the former sound while its,position at the end of the line shows u is the latter sound.Group 4 en i e n an ianThe hlack triangle itself represents 11n its presence on the line shows e its position under the line shows a . The line with the angle at the end represents i the line with the angle at the head shows no sounds, acting only as the axis of position.Group 5 eng i e ng ang iangThe obtuse angle itself represents ng its position on the line indicates le , and that under the line indicades a . The line with the angle at the end shows i the line with the angle at the head shows no sounds. Croup 6 u e n u e ng ong uan uangThe black semi circle itself represents u , its presence upon the line indicates e , its position under the line shows ta. When it is at the end of the line, it indicates the front nasal sound n its position at the end indicates the back nasal sound ng . The line itself represents no sounds.Group 7 ü e n üeng iong uanThe fold itself represents u , its posi tion on the line indicates e , and that under the line indicates a , its prc sence at the head of the line indicates the front nasal sound n and its being at the end indicates the back nasal sound ng . The line itself does not represent any sound. Group 8 üe 3 ToneChinese characters have the following tones Tone 1 high level Tone 2 rising Tone 3 falling rising Tone 4 falling. And there a lit tone in addition.Tone 1 is unmarked.Tone 4 is shown by thickening the end of the stroke at the lower part on the right. For example,EMI39.1 Tone 3 is shown as follows If there s an angle stroke or an angle composed of two strokes at the lower part on the right, the angle is thickened if there s no such an angle stroke or an angle composed of two strokes, both ends of the stroke at the same place as above are thickened,e.g.EMI40.1 Tone 2 is shown by thickening the heginning or the middle of the stroke at the lower part on the right. For example,EMI40.2 The light tone is shown by adding a half dot at the end of the stroke at the lower part on the right. For example,EMI40.3 If at the lower part on the right there stands a little point stroke, the tone may be shown as follows Tone 4 EMI40.4 Tone 3 Tone 2 Light Tone The grammatically regular light tone is unmarked. For example,EMI40.5 tb the SEP suffix SEP of SEP a SEP noun SEP I SEP i SEP I SEP L SEP SEP auxiliary SEP words tb SEP 3 SEP le, SEP E SEP .zhe, SEP 1 SEP LJtJ SEP due, SEP it.

How the stroke letters are set in a Chinese character. 1 The most suitable line to set in the stroke letter representative of the initial consonant is the vertical stroke on the left and that to set in the stroke letter representative of the yunmu is the horizontal stroke at the top. For example, ffi i guo An obvious vertical stroke on the top may also have the initial consonant set in. For example, hú. The slanting or point stroke at the above mentioned two positions may be the substitute for the vertical or horizontal one, if the former is more obvious than the latter. For example,EMI40.6 tb X1, SEP X SEP mel. tb 2 In a non initial consonant syllable, only tne yunmu ano the tone are shown the initial consonant is unmarked, because it does not exist. For example,EMI40.7 3 In the following syllables, the yunmu may be unmarked, but the initial consonant and the tone have to be shown, they are bo po mo fo de te ne le ge ke he ji qi xi zi ci si zhi chi shi ri. For example,EMI41.1 4 As a lot of Chinese characters have a basic structural part on the left or at the top, it s very easy to set the initial consonant and the yunmu in these parts.Some basic structural parts have to be modified to adjust to the two stroke letters representative of the initial consonant and the yunmu EMI41.2 tb SEP is SEP modified SEP to SEP it SEP . SEP e.g. SEP t s SEP qu an tb SEP is SEP modified SEP to SEP JY SEP . SEP e.g. SEP xuan tb SEP is SEP is SEP modified SEP to SEP T SEP angle SEP at SEP the SEP lower SEP end SEP is SEP taken tb away SEP e.g. SEP pan tb is SEP is SEP modified SEP to SEP SEP The SEP third SEP stroke SEP is SEP marked SEP to SEP show tb the SEP tone. SEP e.g. SEP bti tb Other basic structural parts have stroke letters set in themselves as follows EMI41.3 The vertical stroke represents the initial consonant, the slanting stroke represents the yunmu , e.g.EMI41.4 le EMI41.5 The top point stroke represents the yunmu and the vertical stroke on the left represents the initial consonant. e.g. EMI41.6 dang EMI41.7 The vertical stroke on the left represents the initial consonant, the top point stroke represents the yunmu , the fold stroke represents the tone, e.g.EMI41.8 jiou EMI41.9 the top slanting stroke represents the initial consonant, the lowest stroke represents the yunmu , e.g.EMI41.10 tb j SEP jiou tb
