# Planetary gear type reduction starter.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a reduction starter 10 employing a planet ary gear type reduction gear mechanism 24 having an outer ring gear 56 displaceable radialluy of a common axis of a central sun gear 23 and an output shaft 26 carrying planet gears 50 for revolution about the common axis. The outer ring gear 56 is formed by an internally toothed ring gear elastically deformable to assure uniform distribution of load torque to all planet gears 50 . The tooth root bending stress of the ring gear is substantially equalized to the outer periphery bending stress thereof to improve the load performance of the planetary gear type reduction gear mechanism and thus reduce the size and weight of the starter. The outer ring gear has an outer rim 56a of a radial thickness t and a plurality of radially inwardly extending teeth 56b each having a height h. The rim thickness t is determined to fall with a range of from t 0.8h to t 0.4h.
