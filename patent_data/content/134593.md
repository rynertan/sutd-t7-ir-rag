## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELEMENTAL SULPHUR The invention relates to a process for the production of elemental sulphur fran a gas containing hydrogen sulphide H2S and sulphur dioxide SO2 . H2S containing gases become available, for example, in oil refineries and iran processing coke oven gas. Natural gas may also contain H2S. H2S may be ramoved from H2S containing gases by absorption in a regenerable abbent. Subsequent regeneration of the absorbent yields a gas having a much higher H2S content than the H2S containing stating gas and usually also containing carbon dioxide CO2 . The H25 containing gases obtained by this regeneration are usually fed to aClaus type process for the production of elemental sulphur. Elemental sulphur is hereinafter also referred to as sulphur . In a first version of the Claus type process an H2Scontaining gas is partially combusted with a free oxygen containing gas in a furnace referred to herein as thermal zone .In the thermal zone the following reaction takes place with regard to sulphur formation 6 H2S 3 O2 6 x Sx 6 H2O 1 which can be considered as occurring in two steps 2 H2S 3 O2 2 SO2 2 H2O 2 4 H2S 2 SO2 6 x Sx 4 H2O 3 In the thermal zone the H2S is converted to sulphur in accordance with reaction 1 , the quantity of free oxygen containing gas being such that only one third of all H2S can be oxidized to SO, in accordance with reaction 2 .The effluent gas from the thermal zone contains H2S, SO2, sulphur vapour, nitrogen, water vapour and usually also CO2, carbon monoxide CO , carbonyl sulphide COS , carbon disulphide CS2 and hydrogen. The effluent gas from the thermal zone has a temperature usually in the range of from 6000C to 16500C and is cooled to condense most of the sulphur vapour present, to a temperature suitably in the range of from 1200C to 200 C. Thus, sulphur is recovered as a valuable product. The gases are then re heated, to a temperature usually in the range of from 2300C to 2800C and introduced into a first catalytic zone where H2S reacts with to to produce more sulphur in accordance with reaction 3 .The effluent from the first catalytic zone is cooled to condense sulphur. The gas stream freed from sulphur is re heated, to a temperature usually in the range of fran 2000C to 2800C and introduced into a second catalytic zone to produce more sulphur. The e second catalytic zone may be followed by a third and, if desired, the third by a fourth catalytic zone to produce still more sulphur at a temperature usually in the range of fran 2000C to 2800C. Only gases containing much H25 more than, for example, 40 by volume can be readily caibed in the thermal zone in accordance with reaction 1 . Gases containing less H2S between, for example, 20 and 40 by volume can be processed according to a second version of the Claus type process, In the second version the H2S containing gas is split into a first portion representing at least one third and not more than two thirds of the total N S containing gas and a second portion containing the balance of the total H2S containing gas.The first portion is conausted with a free oxygen containing gas in an amount stoichiometric with respect to oxidation of one third of the total amount of h S according to reaction 2 , thus forming a limited amount of sulphur. The e effluent gas fran the thermal zone is cooled to condense the major part of the sulphur formed and then introduced, in admixture with the said second portion of the H2S containing gas, into a first catalytic zone from where the operation is continued as described for the first version. The remaining gases as obtained after condensation of sulphur from the gases leaving the final catalytic zone in which reaction 3 is carried out are also referred to herein as Claus tail gases . These gases contain nitrogen, water vapour, sane H2S and SO2 and usually also CO2 CO, COS, CS2 and hydrogen. H2S and SO2 are present because of the position of the eguilibrium of reaction 3 at the temperature maintained in the final catalytic zone referred to hereinbefore. COS and are present because at least part thereof has been foreed in the thermal zone and they have only partly been erted in the catalytic zone or zones mentioned hereinbefore.This conversion irnrolves a hydrolysis according to the reactions COS H2O CO2 H2S 4 and CS2 2 H2O CO2 2 H2S 5 various catalysts for reactions 3 , 4 and 5 have been described in prior publications. For example, European patent application No. 0038741 describes a catalyst substantially consisting of titanium oxide. It is an object of the present invention to catalyze reactions 3 , 4 and 5 more effectively than hitherto has been the case. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the production of elemental sulphur from a gas containing hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dicxide, which process catprises contacting the said gas with a catalyst composition comprising at least one metal from Group 3b and or Group 4b of the Periodic Table of the Elements on a silica containing carrier. The Periodic Table of the Elements referred to herein is shown on the inside cover of Handbook of Chemistry andPhysics , 63rd edition 1982 1983 . The Group 3b metals mentioned hereinbefore are scandium, yttrium, thorium and the lanthanides, i.e. lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium. The Group 4b metals are titanium, zirconium and hafnium. Preferably, the metal from Group 3b and or Group 4b of the Periodic lable of the Elements is applied as an oxide or sulphate thereof.Most preferably, at least one oxide of titanium, zirconium and or thorium is applied on the carrier. These oxides are themselves active catalysts or are concerted to active catalysts in contact with the starting gas. Very good results have been obtained with titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide. The metals from Group 3b and or Group 4b are applied in an atomic ratio of metals to silicon which can be varied. As a rule, atomic ratios of metal to silicon in the range of from 0.001 to 1.0 are preferred, atomic ratios in the range of from 0.03 to 0.3 being particularly preferred. Suitably, at least 50 by weight of silica is applied in the silica containing carrier. Preferably, at least 75 and, most preferably, at least 90 by weight of silica is applied in the carrier. Among the synthetic silica s commercially available those containing at least 98.0 by weight of silica are generally the most suitable. According to a very attractive embodiment of the present invention a silica is used which has been prepared by the following process steps step a preparing a silica hydrosol by mixing an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate with an aqueous solution of an acid step b converting the hydrosol into droplet form step c shaping the droplets in air or in a liquid which is not miscible with water step d partially pre drying the hydrogel particles obtained step e subjecting the partially pre dried particles to a hydrothermal treatment step f decreasing the cation content of the hydrogel particles thus treated in an aqueous medium to less than 10 by weight, calculated on dry material, and step g drying and optionally calcining the silica particles thus obtained. The e silica thus prepared has a very high attrition resistance and a very high mean side crushing strength. A description of this method of preparation is found in European patent application No. 0067459. A suitable way of preparing the catalyst composition comprises incoroporating a compound or compounds of a Group 3b and or Group 4b metal into the silica when the silica is being prepared, for example during step a or subsequent to step f and prior to step g . If desired, a portion of the said compound or compounds may be incorporated into the silica during step a and the balance subsequent to step f and prior to step g . The e catalyst composition may further be prepared by such conventional techniques as, for example, drynixing followed by calcination, co gellation, co precipitation, impregnation and ion exchange. For example, a mixture of a titanium salt and a silica salt may be co gelled, the material then being dried and ground to an appropriate size or the co gelled material may be slurried and spray dried.However, the catalyst catposition may, for example, also be prepared by reacting the hydroxyl groups at the surface of a silica with a titanium salt by the procedure described in U.S. patent specification No. 3,166,542, 3,220,959 or 3,274,120, thus producing catalyst compositions in which titanium is in chemical combination with silica. Examples of suitable titanium salts are titanium tetrachloride, titanium oxalate and titanyl sulphate TiOSO4 , the latter dissolved in a mixture comprising sulphuric acid and water.In yet another technique, a fumed pyonenic catalyst, in particular a pyrotenic titania silica composition is prepared by combustion of hydrogen and oxygen with a mixture of silicon tetrahalide and titanium halide halide referring to fluoride, chloride bromide or iodide. Another suitable way of preparing the catalyst eomposition comprises impregnating silica with a substantially non aqueous solution of a titanium compound in a non basic, essentially inert, oxygen substituted hydrocarbon as a solvent, removing solvent from the impregnated silica and thereafter calcining the impregnated silica, again producing catalyst compositions in which titanium is in chemical combination with silica. A description of this method of preparation is found in British patent specification No. 1,332,527. The catalyst composition may be subjected to a pre treatment prior to utilization in the process. As a rule it is preferable to do so in order to obtain a higher activity. The pre treatment suitably consists in heating the catalyst composition in an atmosphere of a non reducing gas, such as, for exartple, nitrogen, argon, 002 or of a free oxygen containing gas, such as, for example, air. However, the most suitable method of pre treatment in general also depends upon the form of chemical combination in which the metal catpcund is provided. In many instances titanium compounds have to be converted into oxide.This conversion may as a rule suitably be effected by heating in a non reducing atmosphere, at temperatures in particular in the range of from 2500C to 8000C for periods in the range of from 1 to 18 hours. The catalyst composition may be used according to the invention in any convenient physical form, for example, as a powder, flakes, spheres or pellets. very good results have been obtained with spheres. According to a preferred embodiment the process according to the invention is operated at a temperature above the dew point of sulphur, that is to say above the temperature at which liquid or solid sulphur condenses from the gas at the conditions applied preferably, temperatures in the range of from 2000C to 3500C are used. This embodiment may, for example, be applied in the catalytic zone or zones of the first or second version of theClaus type process which have been described here mbefore in both cases the SO2 in the H2S containing gas has been formed in the thermal zone of the Claus type process. The process according to the invention may be applied to a gas containing H2S to which SO2 has been added or to a gas containing SO2 to which HZS has been added. According to another preferred embodiment the process acoording to the invention is operated at a temperature below the dew point of sulphur, liquid or solid sulphur being deposited on the catalyst composition preferably, temperatures in the range of from 1200C to 1490C are used. This embodiment may be applied to decrease the HZS and SO2 contents of Claus tail gases by reacting H2S with 802 contained therein to produce more sulphur in accordance with reaction 3 and to effectively catalyze reactions 14 and 5 . An off gas containing very littleH2S and SO2 is obtained.This off gas can usually be incinerated without any objection. Incineration of H2S containing off gases can suitably be carried out as described in British patent application No.8318098, filed on even date. The space velocity to be applied will suitably be in the range of from 250 to 20,000 and usually from 1000 to 10,000 Nm3 gas per m3 catalyst composition per hour. Reaction 3 reaches the equilibrium position and COS and CS are almost completely hydrolyzed even when very high space velocities are applied. TheH2S formed by the hydrolysis is subsequently converted into sulphur, thus contributing to an increased sulphur production. When the conversion of N S below the dew point of sulphur drops below a pre deteritlined level the flow of feed gas is stopped and a regeneration gas is passed at elevated temperature over the sulphur loaded catalyst to vaporize sulphur therefrom until sufficient sulphur has been recovered and the activity of the catalyst composition is restored. A suitable method of regeneration is round in British patent specification No 1,307,716. The production of elutetal sulphur is resumed after the activity of the catalyst composition is restored. A very attractive feature of the present invention is that the catalyst composition remains very active in spite of the fact that large amounts of sulphur are deposited on it. For example, depending on the pore volume of the catalyst composition, equilibrium may be reached until more than 90 g of sulphur per 100 g of catalyst composition is deposited. so, the period elapsed between two subsequent regenerations of the catalyst composition is very long. The silica has a pore volume preferably greater than 0.5 and more preferably greater than 1.0 ml g.The pore volume referred to herein is the total pore volume as measurable by the absorption of liquid water. Silica s having such large pore volumes are also very attractive in view of their low particle density, i.e. the density of a given particle including the volume of the silica skeleton and of the pores. Silica supports having a predetermined pore volume can be manufactured as described in European patent application No.0067459. It appears to be especially the amount of water remaining in the partially pre dried hydrogel subsequent to step d mentioned hereinbefore, which determines the pore volume. Another attractive feature of the catalyst composition used in the process according to the invention is that it is insensitive to free oxygen. This contributes to the catalyst comporitisn having a very long life. Free oxygen containing gases may be supplied as, for example, pure oxygen, air enriched with oxygen, air or as other gaseous streams containing significant quantities of oxygen and other components which do not interfere significantly with the reaction contemplated. The e following Examples further illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 An amount bulk volume 250 ml, weight 98 g of silica gel spheres pore volume 1.10 ml g, surface area 300 m2 g was kept for 15 min under a pressure of 0.02 bar abs. The e spheres were then impregnated with tetraisopropylorthotitanate under nitrogen of atmospheric pressure. The impregnated spheres were dried at a temperature of 1100C and the temperature of the dried spheres was increased to 2500C at a rate of 1000C h and to 5000C at a rate of 500C h. The e temperature was kept for one hour at 5000C, increased at a rate of 50 C h to 5500C and kept for 3 h at 550 C. Then, the spheres were allowed to adopt ambient temperature.The catalyst composition thus prepared is referred to as catalyst copposition A some properties thereof are stated in Table I.
