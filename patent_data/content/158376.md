## Description
Method and device for placing building components on top of, and next to, one another. The invention relates to a method for placing building components, such as components for building a wall, on top of and next to one another, the building components having to be placed with the aid of a hoisting means because of their dimensions and or weight. A method of this type is known. In the handling of large building components which are picked up by hoisting means in order to be put down at the intended place there has existed for a very long time the problem that, during placing of the components on top of and or next to already placed components, the attendant persons have to guide the particular component by hand during the lowering of the component. This is not without danger and moreover has the serious disadvantage that it is virtually impossible to place the components on top of and next to one another in such a way that a truly firm wall can be obtained. It is virtually impossible to avoid minor deviations in the joint width and with regard to the position of the front surfaces of the components lying exactly in the same plane, as well as minor deviations in the corners in respect of the front surface of the wall. The invention has the object of providing a very simple solution to this problem. This object is achieved according to th e invention in that, at Least at an upper corner and or lower corner of the component to be placed, a control gauge is placed above the component which has already been placed and adjoins and or lies underneath, the controt gauge having two plate shaped legs which are paral Let to one another and at a mutual distance corresponding to the thickness of a component, and being placed in such a manner that it engages with part of the legs over one component, for example the component which has already been placed, and with the remainder engages over the adjoining component. By means of this control gauge, exact positioning of the component to be placed, relative to the component already placed, is achieved in a simple manner at the corner at which the gauge is employed.This control gauge can take the form of a U shaped brace which can be operated by hand and which can be employed at several corners. When it is used at upper corner which adjoins a component aLready placed, the placing of the components is already substantially improved. Preferably, however, the gauge is also applied to at Least one further corner and this then preferably is the lower corner whichLies diagonally across from the upper corner to which the gauge is applied. The gauge which is employed at an upper corner can consist of 8 U shaped brace hingedly fastened about a horizontal axis, which is transverse to the longitudinal surface of the component to be handled, to that part of the hoisting means which engages on the upper edge of the component, this brace then being pivotable between a raised, non operative position and a downwardly pivoted, operative position in which the base of the U shaped brace is in the horizontal plane of the upper edge of the component, to which the hoisting means is coupled and the legs of which are directed downwards and project beyond the side edge of the component mentioned. During Lowering of the component to be placed the control gauge is then pivoted by hand into the operative position, as a result of which the particular corner arrives at the correct place and specifically just before the lower edge of the component finds support. Then if the component does not sway, the tower edge arrives by itself on the correct place solely as a resuLt of gravity.If a manualLy operated brace is then also employed at the lower corner which is located diagonally opposite the upper corner distortion of corners is aLso completely avoided. This brace preferably takes the form of a resilient clamp. The invention wiLl now be iLlustrated in more detail with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a view of a part of a wall to be built from Large building components. Fig. 2 is a side view of a part of a hoisting device provided with the device according to the invention. Fig. 3 is an end view of Fig. 2. Fig. 4 shows a top view of a possible embodiment of a control gauge to be operated by hand. Fi g. 5 is an end view of the gauge of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a side view of the gauge of Fig. 4. The wall under construction, shown in Fig. 1, consists of building components 1, for example in the form of large sand lime slabs having, for example, the dimensions 75 cm x 1,50 m or larger. 2 i ndicates a component which has to be placed and which is suspended from the hoisting device 3, indicated diagrammatically, which engages by means of pins into bores in the upper edge of the component 2. The Ushaped brace 5, which in Fig. 1 is located in the operative position and thus engages flush around the upper corner 6 of the component to be placed and around the upper corner 7 of the component already placed, is hingedly fastened about the horizontal axis 4 to the above hoisting means. 8 indicates the control gauge to be operated by hand, the design of which is clearer from Fig. 4. Figure 2 shows the hoisting device 3 consisting of a horizontal beam 9, in which pins 12 and 13 are hingedly mounted about axes 10 and 11, the pins having transverse arms 14 and 15 respectively on which the hoisting yoke 16 hingedly engages. The pins are inserted in vertical bores 17 and 18 respectively of a component 2. If the brace 16 is pulled by means of a cable 19 the pins 12 and 13 are pressed against the side walls of the bores 17 and 18 respectively, as a result of which the component can be lifted, displaced and respectively put down elsewhere. The beam 9 has a hinge 20 at one end, on which is fastened a U shaped brace 21 consisting of the base 22, shown in Fig. 3, and the legs 23 and 24 which extend parallel to one another and which are slightly bent outwards at the outer ends, at 25 and 26 respectively, in order to fac Ii faciLitate p Lacing. The broken Lines at 27 in Fig. 2 indicate the non operative, raised state and the full lines indicate the operative position in which the brace is directed downwards and projects beyond the side edge 28 of the component 2. The operative and non operative positions can be secured by means of a spring 29. The control gauge shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 consists of two parts 30 and 31 each provided with a handle 32 and 33 respectively, by means of which these parts are hingedly connected to one another, at 34. A spring 35 which presses the handles apart is located between the latter. The part 30 is a flat plate with bent over probe edge 36. The part 31 consists of a Leg 37 having on it a second ftat plate 38 with probe edge 39. This gauge can be manually opened and clamped onto the edge of a component 2 to be placed, as indicated in Fig. 6. The plates 30, 38 projecting underneath the component 2 then ensure the correct placing. Other embodiments of the U shaped gauge with a handle are of course possible.
