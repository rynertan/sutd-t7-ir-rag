# RANDOM ARTIFICIALLY PERTURBED LIQUID JET APPLICATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
Randomly generated artificial perturbation signals are acoustically coupled to fluid jets to artificially stimulate droplet formation at a rate which varies. Such changes minimize the discernible effects of anomalies in droplet formation e.g. along the cross machine dimension of an extended orifice array caused by standing acoustic waves or other phenomena. A relatively low frequency bandwidth limited square wave with randomly occurring transitions has a controlled amplitude related to a desired magnitude of deviation in the rate of droplet stimulation. This first random signal is used, in the exemplary embodiment, to control the frequency of a frequency modulated oscillator having a relatively higher mean frequency related to the naturally expected rate of droplet formation. As a result, piezoelectric crystal drive furnished by the oscillator randomly varies between upper and lower frequency limits. Provision is also made to ensure that such transition between upper and lower frequency limits is accomplished in a controlled and relatively gradual manner.
