# Process for the production of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.

## Abstract
A process for producing acrylic acid or methacrylic acid by reacting acetic acid or propionic acid with formaldehyde in a gas phase is described, characterized by carrying out the reaction in the presence of a solid catalyst containing at least one of boron oxide or phosphorus oxide and having an acid site of an acid strength, pKa 3.0. The solid catalyst is of high activity and is satisfactory in both selectivity and con version and, furthermore, its high selectivity can be main tained for long periods of time. Thus the desired product, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, can be produced in high yield.
