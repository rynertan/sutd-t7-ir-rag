# ROBOT CONTROLLING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A robot controlling device for turning the arm of a robot around a turning shaft as a center by driving a turn drive unit 103 . A turning speed discriminator SJC is provided so that the turning speed of the arm of the robot does not exceed the maximum allowable speed of the drive of the turn drive unit 103 . The discriminator SJC is constructed to calculate the allowable turning speed Ft responsive to the length Ra of the arm inputted, to compare the inputted instructed speed Fin with the calculated allowable turning speed Ft and to produce the lower speed of the compared both speeds as an instruction speed Fc .
