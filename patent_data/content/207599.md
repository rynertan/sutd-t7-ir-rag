## Description
NOVEL COMPOUNDSThis invention relates to novel arachidonic acid analogues, to processes for preparing them, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and the use of such compounds and compositions in medicine. It is known that certain arachidonic acid metabolites can produce harmful effects in man. For example, some prostaglandins and thromboxanes, produced via cyclo oxygenation of arachidonic acid, can contribute to inflammation in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, and that products produced via lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid, such as the leukotrienes, are implicated in the production of the pathology of asthma and other allergic diseases. European Published Patent Application No.0109225 discloses certain arachidonic acid analogues which can inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism by one or both of these metabolic pathways.We have now discovered a new class of arachidonic acid analogues which are inhibitors of phospholipase A2,one of the enzymes involved in the release of arachidonic acid from its phospholipid store. These analogues are thus of value in the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases whose symptoms are controlled by arachidonic acid metabolites.

Suitably R1 is hydrogen.Suitably R1 is ethyl.Suitably R2 is hydrogen, CO2H CO2CH3, CO2CH2CH3 or cH2Bu. Preferably R1 is hydrogen and R2 is hydrogen, COZH, CO2CH3, CO2CH2CH3 or CO2Bu.Preferably n is 2.Preferably m is 4 or 5.Salts or amides of the compounds of formula I need not be pharmaceutically acceptable, since they can be used as intermediates to prepare other pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of the invention.Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and salts with ammonia, organic bases and amino compounds.Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable amides are those wherein the carboxyl group is modified to a group CoNR3R3a, wherein R3 and R3a are each hydrogen or C1.6 alkyl.The present invention also encompasses splvates of the compounds of formula I or, where appropriate the salts or amides thereof examples of suitable solvates are hydrates and ethanolates preferably the solvates are hydrates.

Inmediately prior to incubation at 370C Spl of DMSO or compound in DMSO were added. The final assay volume was 1.75 ml. After 10 minutes incubation at 37C 750 l of substrate was added, with mixing, and the incubation continued for a further 15 min. The reaction is terminated by placing on ice and adding 5ml CHCl3 Me0H 2 1v v . The lover organic phase is reved ahd stored under N2 at 200C until analysed. Analysis is by dimensional t.l.c. on polygram Sil G sheets in the solvent system petroleum ether diethyl ether acetic acid 60 40 1, v v . In this solvent system the phospholipid remains at the origin and the arachidonic acid has an approximate Rf. value of 0.36. The areas of interest are cut from the plates and their radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation coLmting. All compounds are tested in triplicate.Calculation The radioactivity of the arachidonic acid is expressed as a percentage of the total dpm cut from the plate. The percentage inhibition of arachidonic acid release compared to that of the control is calculated after correction for the level of spontancous release where x corrected mean arachidonic acid release in control y corrected arachidonic acid release after inhibition inhibition Z X Y x 100 xThe nean of the triplicate samples is calculated giving z standard deviation e.
