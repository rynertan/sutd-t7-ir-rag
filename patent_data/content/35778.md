# MODULAR SYSTEM CONTROLLER FOR A TRANSITION MACHINE

## Abstract
A modular system controller for a transition machine enables expansion of throughput in multiprocessing opera tions. The modular system controller may be embodied utiliz ing separate identical system controllers for computing dis joint computational problems or may utilize a plurality of identical subcomponents of the system controller for enabl ing a vertical or horizontal expansion of data constructs util ized in the transition machine.
