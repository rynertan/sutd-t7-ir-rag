# DISPERSIVE PRISM ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A dispersive prism arrangement comprises a pair of identical triangular prisms 10, 20 each of which is mounted on a platform 32 . The two platforms 32 are rotatably mounted on a common shaft 40 which slides in a groove 42 and each platform 32 is also mounted on a respective shaft 34 which slides in a respective groove 35 . These two further shafts 34 are biased outwardly by springs 37 . The two prisms are symmetrically disposed about the com mon shaft 40 . Equal but opposite rotation may be imparted to the two prisms by rotating a knob 47 which drives the common shaft 40 . A multiwavelength input beam 14 incident on the first face of the first prism 10 is refracted at this face, reflected at the second and third faces, emerges after refraction at the second face, and makes a symmetrical passage through the second prism 20 . The prisms 10, 20 may be rotated so that each component of the beam emerges from the second prism without offset or deviation relate to the input beam.
