## Description
The invention relates to new pharmaceutical compositions having a psychotropic activity, to new piperazine derivatives which may be used in such compositions as the active substance, and to the preparation of the said compositions and active compounds. It was found that compounds of the general formula 1 wherein is a 4 or 7 benzimidazolyl group which may be substituted in position 2 with alkyl, or a 7 indolyl group, or a 4 or 7 benzotriazolyl group, or a 5 or 8 carbo or 3,4 dihydrocarbo styryl group, or a 8 quinolinyl group, and the acid addition salts of these compounds have interesting psychotropic properties. As a halogen atom, R₁ is preferably fluoro, chloro or bromo, and as an alkyl group, for example, a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated group having 1 5 carbon atoms. When R₂ is an alkyl group, this is preferably the methyl group or ethyl group. As a hydroxyalkyl group, the group R₃ preferably comprises 1 3 carbon atoms. Compounds which are preferred on the basis of their activity pattern are When a chiral carbon atom is present, both the racemate and the individual isomers belong to the invention. Suitable acids with which the compounds of general formula 1 can form pharmaceutically acceptable acid additon salts are, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, and naphtalenesulphonic acid. The above described compounds of general formula 1 have a psychotropic activity and are hence excellently suitable for the treatment of affections or diseases which are the result of disturbances in the central nervous system, for example, psychoses, aggression, fear and depression. Some of the compounds moreover have also a good central analgetic activity. Dependent on the meanings of the symbols A, R₁ R₃, An important advantage of the present compounds of general formula 1 is that their activity is very specific. It was found, for example, that in mice the antiaggressive activity is not associated with undesired sedative effects. As a rule the antipsychotic activity is produced without the side effects, which are generally considered to be undesired, as a result of dopaminolytic and sedative activity. Dependent on the meanings of the groups A and R₁ R₃, both the antiaggressive activity and the antipsychotic activity may be most prominent. The antiaggressive activity of the compounds was measured in a test suitable for that purpose on isolated mice Advances in Pharmacol. The compounds to be investigated were administered orally to the selected mice. Five mice per dose were used. Sixty minutes after administration of the compound to be investigated, the animals were again evaluated for fighting behaviour. The compound to be investigated is inactive in the administered dose when in this case also 3 or more fighting periods were observed within 3 minutes after a mouse which had not been kept isolated was placed in the cage of the mouse which had been kept isolated. The ED₅₀ value in mg of active substance per kg of body weight was calculated form the results obtained. The compounds according to the invention have an ED₅₀ value which is smaller than 20 mg kg and for most of the compounds the ED₅₀ value is 0.1 5 mg kg. Due to the strong antiaggressive activity and the absence of undesired side effects, for example, sympatholytic, dopaminolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative properties, the compounds are excellently suitable for use in the treatment of intra and extrapunitive behaviour and overt aggressive behaviour in man and animal. For use in humane medicine are to be considered first of all the control of aggressive symptoms in psychiatric diseases and serious forms of psychopathological aggression. As application possibilities in the veterinary field are to be considered especially those forms of aggression which occur in the transport of agricultural domestic animals and the mixing of groups of these animals. The antipsychotic activity of the compounds of general formula 1 was determined in a test procedure in which the suppression of conditioned behaviour in test animals was measured according to procedures known The sedative activity of these compounds was studied in a test in which the influencing of the spontaneous locomotoric activity of test animals is measured according to known methods. For the active compounds of general formula 1 it was found that generally dopaminolytic and sedative effects do not occur in dosages which are at least a factor three higher than the dosages which give 50 suppression of the conditioned behaviour. The quantity, frequency and way of administration may differ for each individual case, also dependent on the nature and the severity of the disturbances. A dosage of 5 500 mg and preferably of 25 150 mg daily are generally suitable for humane application. For veterinary purposes the dosage preferably is 0.1 10 mg kg of body weight. The analgetic activity of the compounds was determined in an analgetic test in mice Brit. J. Pharm. The thrombolytic activity is determined using the method described by Kumada The active compounds according to the invention and their acid addition salts can be processed, according to known standard methods, to compositions such as pills, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders, injection liquids, and the like while using the conventional auxiliary substances, for example, solid and liquid carrier materials. The compounds of general formula 1 are new compounds with the exception of the compounds wherein n and q are 0, and A together with the two carbon atoms of the phenyl group forms a heterocyclic group having 5 or 6 ringatoms, which as the only hetero atom contains one nitrogen atom at the meta position in relation to the piperazine group some of these compounds are known from French patent specification 81.23744 , and compounds in which n and q are 0, and the group of general formula 2 is a 4 or 7 benzimidazolyl group which may be substituted in position 2 with alkyl, or a 7 indolyl group, or a 4 or 7 benzotriazolyl group which compounds are known from Netherlands Patent Application 82.01708 , or a 5 or 8 carbo or 3,4 dihydrocarbo styryl group which compounds are known from Netherlands patent application 81.04923 , or an 8 quinolinyl group which compound is known from Ber. The new compounds according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known for the synthesis of analogous compounds see, for example, United States Patent Specification 2,976,290 and J.Med.Chem. The compounds can be obtained, for example, by reaction of a compound of general formula 3 with a compound of general formula 4, in which formula L is a so called leaving group, preferably chlorine, bromine, alkyl SO₃ or aryl SO₃. This reaction may be carried out both in an inert apolar organic solvent, and in a protic polar solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are chlorobenzene, toluene, pyridine, acetonitrile, lower aliphatic alcohols, for example, ethanol, propanol and butanol. In order to bind the releasing acid, an acid binder, for example NaHCO₃ or K₂CO₃ or an organic base, for example, triethylamine, may be used. The reaction temperature usually is between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent used. It is sometimes necessary or desired in this mode of preparation first to replace the hydrogen atom at the nitrogen atom in the starting material of general formula 4 by a protective group, for example, the benzyl group, an aryloxycarbonyl group or alkoxycarbonyl group the alkoxy group of which comprises 1 4 C atoms. Said protective group can then be removed from the resulting final product by means of the methods conventionally used for this purpose, for example, by catalytic hydrogenation or by acid hydrolysis. Conventional solvents are lower aliphatic alcohols and aliphatic esters thereof or aqueous mineral acid. The reactions are carried out at temperatures between room temperature and reflux temperature of the solvent used. The compounds of general formula 1 can furthermore be obtained by reduction of a compound of general formula 5 or general formula 6, in which the symbols have the above mentioned meanings. This reduction reaction may be carried out, for example, with suitable reduction agents, for example LiAlH₄ or a BH₃.S CH₃ ₂ complex in a suitable solvent, for example, ether or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is carried out at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent used. This method can be used readily only when besides the keto group or keto groups to be reduced, no other groups sensitive to reduction are present in the starting substances of general formula 5 or 6. Another suitable method of preparing the compounds of general formula 1 is the reaction of a compound of general formula 7 with a piperazine of general formula 8, in which A, R₁ R₃, The compounds of general formula 1 can further be prepared by reaction of a compound of general formula 9 with NaNO₂ in the manner described, Some compounds of general formula 1 can furthermore be obtained by conversion of another compound of general formula 1. For example, compounds of general formula 1, in which R₁ and or R₃ is are an esterified hydroxyl function, can be converted by hydrolysis Moreover, compounds of the general formula 1, wherein wherein R₁ R₃, The reaction is carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as for example a lower alkane, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a strong base, for example aryl or alkyllithium or a lithium dialkylamine, at temperatures preferably between 100 C and 0 C. Finally, compounds of general formula 1 can be obtained, dependent on the meaning of A, by converting compounds of general formula 11 into compounds of general formula 1 by a cyclisation reaction. This cyclisation generally takes place, dependent on the meanings of Z and Z and the desired meaning of A, The starting materials to be used in the above described methods can be obtained, in so far as these are new compounds, in a manner known for the synthesis of analogous compounds.
