## Description
Titanium Nitride Dispersion Strengthened Bodies This invention relates to the production of titanium nitride dispersion strengthened bodies. The strengthening of titanium containing alloys by gas phase nitriding to produce a dispersion of titanium nitride is now an established procedure but the nitriding of thick sections remains a problem because the kinetics are so slow. According to the present invention a method of production of a titanium nitride dispersion strengthened body involves the steps of producing a porous body from titanium containing alloy powder and then causing a flowing mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen to permeate the permeable matrix of powder particles so formed so as to effect nitriding of the titanium. Preferably said porous body is produced by heating the powder in a hydrogen containing atmosphere to achieve partial sintering, ie. sintering of the particles to such an extent that the body or matrix is permeable to the nitrogen hydrogen gas flow and is sufficiently self supporting to withstand the flow pressure. A suitable temperature for the partial sintering is in the range of 900 1250 C. The initial porous bodies are preferably disc shaped and may be formed by heating the powder in the container in which it is to be nitrided, or in a separate container of similar shape. Another method of producing the porous sinter may be by causing the powder, in a semi molten atomised form, to impinge and accumulate on a collecting plate. The bodies so formed will tend to be irregular in shape and may need machining to fit the nitriding container. As previously mentioned the porous sinter must have sufficient strength not to disintegrate during the nitriding stage and sufficient interconnected porosity to allow access of the nitriding gas. A suitable temperature for nitriding is in the range 1000 to 1150 C. After nitriding the body is preferably degassed in hydrogen to reduce the excess nitrogen in solid solution. In one example of the invention, tbe nitrided alloy is used in the production of a tie bar of round section.In this case, the alloy powder may initially be produced as a plurality of disc shaped green compacts which are then subjected to the aforesaid partial sintering and nitriding steps. Thereafter a quantity of the discs so formed may be inserted into an extrusion container and consolidated, by extrusion, into a round section rod or bar. In another example, a quantity of the porous bodies may be consolidated, eg. by a rolling technique, into sheet form. It will be understood that various other methods of consolidating quantities of the porous bodies into desired shapes may be employed. If desired, after nitriiking the porous bodies may once again be reduced to powder, as by comminuting, for use in conventional powder metallurgy forming techniques. It is thought that the nitrided powder will exhibit les s ,.,s,usceptibility to oxidation at room temperatures than titanium oxide dispersion strengthened powders wTlich require special handling, eg. in inert atnospheres, to prevent oxidation at room temperatures. The invention has particular application to the nitriding of titanium containing austenitic and ferritic steel powders, especially 20 Cr 25 Wi Ti powder. Thus, ,according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a titanium containing steel powder formed body which has been produced in accordance with the method of the invention. The invention also extends to components consolidated from said bodies and to powder derived by comminution of said bodies.
