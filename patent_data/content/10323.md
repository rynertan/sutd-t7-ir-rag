# A method for producing orthogonally screened colour separation images.

## Abstract
A method and a device for producing separation images which are essentially orthogonally screened for reproducing an original colour image. In one embodiment, the original image is mounted on a drum 1 which is rotated in a Y direction. A sensor is moved in an X direction, essentially orthogonal to the Y directionaxially of the drum 1 adjacent the drum s surface and senses the several colours of the original image 12 on a point by point basis. The distances in the X and Y directions 1₂,1₁ between the scanned points on the original image 12 are changed for each separation image according to trigomometric relationships. Thus, separation images are produced which have equal screen ruling and different screen angles relative to a Y direction. The method and apparatus produce signals which are applied to some form of device or devices which actually generate the separations for use in multicolour print ing or the like.
