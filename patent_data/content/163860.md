# Beta copper base alloy adapted to be formed as a semi solid metal slurry and a process for making same.

## Abstract
A predominately beta phase copper base alloy which is adapted for forming in a semi solid slurry condition. The alloy has a microstructure comprising discrete particles within a lower melting point matrix and consists essentially of from about 9 to about 10.5 by weight aluminum, at least about 10 by weight nickel and the balance essenti ally copper. In accordance with an alternative embodiment the nickel can be replaced on a one for one basis by iron within certain limits. The alloys are processed by chill cast ing with a cooling rate throughout the section of the casting comprising at least about 10 C sec. The alloys as cast or when reheated to a semi solid exhibit a microstructure suit able for press forging.
