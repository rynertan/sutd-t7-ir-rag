# Multi functional sensing or measuring system.

## Abstract
A single multi functional sensing and measuring system capable of detecting both temperature and humidity is fabri cated with a porous metal oxide ceramics whose dielectric constant is varied with an ambient temperature and whose electric resistance is changed with ambient humidity. The single sensing element can detect simultaneously and rapidly both the variations in the ambient temperature and humidity, respectively, by means of variation in electric resistance and dielectric constant of the sensing element. A multi functional sensing or measuring system incorporating such single multi functional sensing system described above is also pro vided in which a combination of the single multi functional sensing element connected in series with a resistor is impres sed with a rectangular pulse voltage so that the ambient temperature and humidity can be measured simultaneously in terms of a time constant of a transient state value and a steady state value of a divided voltage across the resistor. The single multi functional sensing elements described in the present invention can find their wide applications not only in the air conditioning devices but also in other fields which require temperature and humidity controls.
