# AN ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS OF AN AQUEOUS ALKALI METAL HALIDE SOLUTION AND ELECTROLYTIC CELL USED THEREFOR

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrolytic process using a horizontal type cation exchange membrane electrolytic cell in which cath olyte liquor is supplied into a cathode compartment with initial linear velocity of at least 8 cm sec and gas content of at most 0.6 at a catholyte liquor outlet. Also disclosed is an electrolytic cell used for the foregoing process. The invention enables not only conversion of a mercury electrolytic cell to a cation ex change membrane electrolytic cell with low cost, but the long term and stable operation.
