# Needlecraft case with extender.

## Abstract
A storage case for needlecraft materials and the like, with an extender for the case. The storage case has three sections hinged together so the case can be folded into thirds, each of the three sections having pockets for storing materials for easy retrieval. At least one section has a sub divided pocket for receiving knitting needles. A flap above the sub divided pocket can either cover the ends of short needles, or lie against the backing to allow long needles to pass over the flap. Another flap is positioned to cover the ends of the long needles. One end section has a large pocket opening towards the hinge. An extender is foldable about its hinge into two sections. One section of the exten der can be placed into the large pocket, and the entire case can be closed as one case.
