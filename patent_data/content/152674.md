# Process of making steel in converter using a great amount of iron bearing cold material.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a process for producing a steel in at least two converters using a great amount of an iron bear ing cold material. The iron bearing cold material and a carbonaceous material are supplied into one of the convert ers under the presence of a molten iron or a preliminarily treated molten iron and are melted therein under oxygen blowing to obtain a preliminarily treated molten iron con taining a high content of carbon, and said preliminarily treated molten iron is refined in the other converter under oxygen blowing to obtain a molten steel having the given composition.
