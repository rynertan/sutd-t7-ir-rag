# Improved enzyme immunoassay and a kit therefor.

## Abstract
The use, in an enzyme immunoassay, of a detecting support carrying thereon enzyme detecting reagent fixed at a first set of localised predetermined positions in detecting enzyme labels immobilized at a corresponding and second set of fixed localised predetermined positions carried on an immunological reaction support, the immobilization of which labels is the result of an immunoassay reaction, said detecting support being superimposible over said reaction support with the respective sets of positions in contact to permit detection of enzyme labels. A kit for use of the assay method is provided.
