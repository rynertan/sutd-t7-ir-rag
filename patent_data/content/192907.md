# Semiconductor device having improved signal input portion.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device including a plurality of input signal pads P₀ , ..., P₇ a plurality of emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ are connected to the input signal pads P₀ , ..., P₇ a plurality of input signal buffers BUF , ..., ₀ BUF₇ are connected to the emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ and a plurality of con stant current sources I₀₁ , ..., I₇₁ are connected to the emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ . The emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ are in proximity to the input signal pads P₀, ..., P₇ , and the constant current sources I₀, ..., I₇ are in proximity to the emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ . The current values of the constant current sources I₀₁ , ..., I₇₁ are determined in ac cordance with the length of the corresponding connections between the emitter followers Q₀₁ , ..., Q₇₁ and the input signal buffers BUF₀ , ..., BUF₇ .
