## Description
The present invention relates to a cosmetic preparation to promote the trophism of the cutis and of the hair follicles. More particularly the present invention relates to a cosmetic preparation to be used as revitalizing agent for the skin and as active factor for the hair growth.When the skin is pale, wrinkly, little elastic, dehydrated and when it shows clesr symptoms of suffering and of precocious ageing, it is most likely that Its germinative layer is more or less seriously atrophic.It is in fact known that the germinative layer of the skin consists of continuously reproducing and growing cells and that is requires a continuous feeding of nutrient substances to be maintained in a vital and efficient condition.It is known as well that such a feeding is prevailingly, if not exclusively, entrusted to the blood circulation.When the blood circulation towards and within the germinative layer is hindered, or the feeding of nutrient substances is reduced, said layer becomes more and more atrophy and the skin becomes wrinkly, pale, old .In the particular case of the hair, for the matrix and the papilla, which are involved by an intense metabolism, it is even more necessary to get the availability in a relevant amount of the nutrient substances required for their trophism as it is known, a want of said substances would firstly cause the weakening and then the atrophy of the hair follicle, with attendant lack of the capacity of forming new hair.The cosmetic preparations for more or less specific topic treatment of the skin which have been up to date of wide use in order to attenuate the afore said drawbacks, are in most cases mere palliatives, the efficacy of which finds well known limits, essentially imputable to the fact that it is not possible through them to afford to the skin germinative layer the or those few nutrient substances which said preparations may comprise in their composition.In the literature too, several proposals are detailedly described for the solution of the afore said problem.a In the German published application No. 2,317,138 a preparation against the hair fail is described, essentially consisting of a serum extracted from snakes, animals, particularly from snacks, serum which is used either as such or suitably concentrated and processed.The specification does also contemplate the addition to the serum of simple molecules, aminoacids, vitamins, hormones, etc.b In the French Patent No. 2,472,385 the use is taught, in the cosmetic field, of the product of thermal cracking of serums, tissue extracts and the like, the cracking being prosecuted until peptides of molecular weight of between 5000 and 50,000 are obtained. It is in fact known that these peptides have the property of influencing the cell growth c In the French patent No. 2,160,285 the use of liophylized product is foreseen in the cosmetic field. This product is obtained from several serums, amniotic liquid or placenta.d The French patent No. 1,303,571 teaches the use, in the cosmetic field, of preparations containing one or more biocatalyst complexes, mainly of proteic nature, formed by combining biochemical or chemical compounds, showing a certain nutrient action toward the skin, with biochemical products suitable for accelerating the cutaneous cellular metabolism, such as hormones, vitamins, etc.The common feature of all these products and preparations is their biological and extractive origin, whereby their production cannot be adequately standardized, with the evident consequences, especially as regards the constancy of the effects.Moreover, it can not be neglected the fact that not only the presence or absence, but also the amount of the single components of the subject mixtures seem to be important.For the culture in vitro of the epithelial cells the use is known of a synthetic nutrient medium comprising a mixture of simple and quantitatively defined molecules.It is also known that the synthetic medium, in order to obtain a more time extended action on the cultures, must be supplemented with a determined amount of a natural medium.The problem not yet solved until now is that of providing a cosmetic preparation which does not only comprise all the nutrient substances which are essential in order to maintain in a vital and efficient condition the germinative layer of the skin and the piliferous papilla, but does also ensure a substantial contribution, balanced and complete, of these substances thereto.The aforesaid problem is solved according to the present invention by means of a cosmetic preparation for the topical treatment of the skin in order to promote its cellular trophism, characterized by comprising an efficacious amount of a nutrient medium for in vitro culture of isolated human epithelial cells, sndMrr ffibo1 serum of bovine phoetus related to the amount being used of said nutrient medium More particularly a cosmetic preparation according to the invention comprises, as a weight percentage referred to the total weight of the preparation, from 0.1 to 1 of said nutrient medium for the in vitro culture of isolated human epithelial cells and from 2 to 10 of serum of bovine phoetus.If account is taken of the conventional mode of application of a cosmetic preparation and of the well known impermeability of the skin towards almost all the a fore said nutrient substances since the factor limiting the cutaneous absorption Is, as it is well known, the horny layer of the skin , said nutrient substances should be preferably present in their simplest form and of lowest molecular weight for instance aminoacids instead of proteins, nucleic bases instead of nucleic acids, pentoses and hexoses instead of polysaccharides, etc. Moreover, still to promote the permeation of said nutrient substances through the skin, the cosmetic preparation of the present invention comprises dermophilic vehicles, such as for instance ethyl alcohol, polyalcohols or glycols and generally emulsifiers, of the type conventionally used for such a purpose.It is known that the lotions for topical use based on extractive mixtures from connective tissues of animals organs such as for example Tricosaccaride mainly comprising sulphomucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycosanes , can be advantageously used in order to bring to normality the functions of the piliferous papillae and of the related germinative cells. The action of these substances involves the small blood vessels which irrorate the pilosebaceous follicle, restoring the normal conditions of local circulation. The concentration range of the active substance in these solutions may vary from 0.2 to 3 .It has now been surprisingly found that the combination of these substances with the previously considered active compounds and which are the subject of the present invention, gives place to a composition which does not only act simultaneously on both causes leading to the hair fall local circulatory lack and insufficient contribution of nutrient elements , but does also show an unexpectedly greater activity with respect to that foreseable from the sole sum of the single components.According to the invention it has been in fact found that the extractive mixtures and the nutrient compositions for mediums of cellular cultures show, wt is4G08, a relevant action synergism with an improvement of the efficacy of both active substances, the combination of which permits moreover, as above mentioned, to act on the whole of the causes determining the hair fall.It is thus a further subject of the present invention a synergic composition for the stimulation of the trichogenesis which is essentially characterized by the fact of comprising a first active component consistig of extractive mixtures obtained from connective tissus of animal organs and a second active component consisting of a nutrient medium for the in vitro culture of human epithelial cells.It is known that a nutrient medium for the in vitro culture of isolated human cells contains all the nutrient elements necessary for the life of the cells and for their survival and reproduction.The topical application of a cosmetic preparation according to the invention, which is an in vivo application generally carried out in the skin areas wherein the blood irroration and thus the feeding of nutrient substances is most hindered and slowered, has proven to cause a substantial improvement of the local trophic conditions and a consequent normalization of the vitality and reproducing activity of the cells.It has moreover been found that the mineral salts, normally present in the medium for the in vitro culture of isolated human cells, must be preferably absent in the nutrient medium incorporated in the cosmetic preparation according to the present invention.As a matter of fact, whilst the mineral salts, in the strict sense, are not nutrient substances, on the other side they are already present in the cellular liquids.Moreover, in order to take it into account the unavoidable dispersion of nutrient substances at the time of the application of a cosmetic preparation according to the invention, the concentration of the nutrient substances in the medium incorporated in said preparation must be 3 to 5 times greater than the concentration of said substances in the like medium used for the in vitro culture of isolated human epithelial cells.Further features of the present invention shall appear more clearly from the following description in which a composition of a nutrient medium shall be precised for the use in a preparation according to the invention and wherein some examples shall be given of cosmetic formulations based on the afore said product.

The injections were repeated for two periods of five days in succession, with an interval of two rest days.The tests gave the following results.The solution 1 caused the fresh growth of the coat or hair around the injection area.The fresh growth was clearly viewable at about 15 days from the begining of the injection. The solution 2 in turn caused a more rapid fresh growth, which moreover involved a more extended area with respect to that obtained, for each animal, with the sole solution 1 .As already mentioned, the present invention relates also to an anti wrinkle, hydrating and revitalizing action for the skin. In the following examples 10 to 13 the preparation of a cream,a milk and a lotion is illustrated. EXAMPLE 10A planetary equipment of stainless steel is charged with 90 of the water necessary for the preparation of the cream and then the temperature is raised to 70 to 800C. Parallely a separate melter is charged with polyglycol stearate, stearin, lanolin oil, squalane and preservants, bringing the temperature to a value of between 70 and 800C and starting the mixing action as soon as possible. When the temperatures of the aqueous phase and of the fatty phase are in equilibrium, the fatty phase is poured into the water. The planetary mixing is started and the mixture is slowly tooled. When the mass has reached 35do, there are added the concentrated medium, previously dispersed in the 10 of water, the serum of bovine phoetus and the perfume. Then the cooling is completed by keeping the mass under stirring. EXAMPLE 11 A planetary equipment of stainless steel is charged with 90 of the water needed for the preparation of the milk and with the propylene glycol and the temperature is brought to a value of between 700C and 80no. Parallelly, a separate mixer is charged with polyglycol stearate, lanoline oil, glyceryl monostearate and the preservants, bringing the temperature to a value of between 700C and 800C and starting the mixing as soon as possible.When the temperatures of the aqueous phase and of the fatty phase are in equilibrium, the fatty phase is poured into the water. The planetary mixing is started and the mass is slowly cooled.When the mass has reached 350 C, there are added the concentrated medium, as a predispersion in 10 of the water, the phoetal serum and the perfume. The cooling is then completed by keeping the mass always under stirring. EXAMPLE 12A vessel of stainless steel, fitted with a stirrer is charged in the order with 90 of the needed water, then with the concentrated medium, the serum, the glucose, theHamamelis extract, the glycerine, the preservants and the perfume.The mixihg is started and then the ethoxylate lanoline is added, in a form predissolved in the remaining 10 of hot water. The mass is stirred for 15 minutes and then added with the alcohol and stirred again.The pH is brought to 6.5 with diluted sodium hydroxide or HCl, then the mass is filtered in a filter of the type Seitz US and then bottled. EXAMPLE 13A stainless steel vessel, fitted with a stirred, is charged with the necessary water and then with all the components according to example 7, whereas the solid mixture is separately prepared according to example 8. The mass is stirred for about 20 minutes, and then controlled to verify whether the pH is 6.5 if necessary the Ph is adjusted with diluted sodium hydroxide or HCl. After controlling the final volume the mass is stirred again for five minutes and the solution is maintained at rest for a night, and then filtered in a clarifying filter of the type Seitz US.After filtration, the packaging is carried out, comprising the bottling of the solution and the simultaneous dosing of the solid mixture in the reservoir plug.
