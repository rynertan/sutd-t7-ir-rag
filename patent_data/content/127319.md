# Continuous casting apparatus for the production of cast sheets.

## Abstract
A continuous casting apparatus for the production of cast sheets 3 having a casting space 2 defined by a pair of opposed endless belts 5,6 and a pair of side plates 11,12 arranged near the both side edge portions of the belts while being brought into intimate contact therewith and designed to be converged toward a drawing direction. In this apparatus, a filmy water flow forming pad 7,7 arranged behind each of the belts, and each of the side plates are so profiled that the casting space inclusive of the tapered portion depicts a smooth curve at at least a transition area from the taper end portion to a constant thickness portion.
