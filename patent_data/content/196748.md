# Information recording medium and manufacturing method thereof.

## Abstract
A disk shaped recording medium of the invention has a photosensitive recording layer 12 formed on a substrate 10 . Tellurium oxide clusters 18 are dispersed in a hydro carbon matrix 14 of the recording layer 12 so as to thermally stabilize the matrix 14 . Tellurium clusters 16 are dispersed in the matrix 14 which is thermally stabilized by dispersion of the tellurium oxide clusters 18 . The recording layer 12 has excellent oxidation and heat resistance, the recording medium is manufactured by a plasma sputtering technique.
