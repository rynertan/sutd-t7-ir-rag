## Description
This invention relates to a multi terminal semiconductor laser device which attains laser oscillation with a stabilized oscillation wavelength and which allows changes in the oscillation wavelength. With enlarged applications in such fields as optical communication systems, optical measuring systems, optical information processing systems, semiconductor lasers, etc., semiconductor lasers which oscillate laser light with a stabilized oscillation wavelength are required. In order to achieve an optical communication mode with wavelength superposition, frequency modulation FM or the like, semiconductor lasers allowing the oscillation wavelength to vary are also required. For these reasons, semiconductor lasers such as distributed feedback DFB lasers, distributed Bragg reflector DBR lasers, internal reflector interferometric lasers, compound resonator type lasers, external resonator type lasers, etc., have been studied. However, skilled workers are required for the formation of diffraction gratings of the DFB lasers and the DBR lasers. Moreover, structures and the production process of the internal reflector interferometric lasers, compound resonator type lasers, and external resonator type lasers are complicated, and it is difficult to put them into practical use. There is known from JP A 5897888 a semiconductor laser device in which a double heterostructure multilayered crystal containing an active layer for laser oscillation is formed on a single crystal substrate having an elongate channel comprising a plurality of channel portions of respective widths and lengths which are positioned in a row along the longitudinal direction of the channel. In the latter device, the channel portions are of different height relative to the substrate and thereby present a plurality of stepped differences in height between the various channel portions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor laser which overcomes or mitigates the limitations and abovementioned disadvantages of the known devices. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor laser device in which a double heterostructure multi layered crystal containing an active layer for laser oscillation is formed on a single flat crystal substrate having an elongate channel of constant depth comprising a plurality of channel portions of respective widths and lengths which are positioned in a row along the longitudinal direction of the channel, resulting a plurality of optical waveguides in said active layer corresponding to said respective channel portions, said optical waveguides being optically coupled but being electrically separated from each other. In one embodiment, the central axis of one of said channel portions is different from that of the adjacent channel portion, but the one channel portion and the adjacent channel portion have a common boundary portion. In another embodiment, the central axes of said channel portions are in common and one of said channel portions which is narrower than the other channel portions is located in the central area of the channel.

Figure 7 shows another device in accordance with this invention in which the width W₁ of the channel portion in the region 7a is the same as the width W₂ of the channel portion in the region 7b, wherein W₁ W₂ 7 µm and the width W₃ of the central portion is narrower than the widths W₁ and W₂ of the other portions, wherein W₃ 3 µm. The length L₃ of the narrow channel portion of width W₃ is set at about 50 µm. This device is a triple terminal device by which control of current injected into a third region 19, which is located between the regions 7a and 7b and which corresponds to the narrow channel portion, allows control of the oscillation wavelength.
