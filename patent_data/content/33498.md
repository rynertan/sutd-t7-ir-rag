# A process for preparing reaction injection molded polyurethane compositions employing aliphatic amine chain extenders.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for preparing reac tion injection molded polyurethane compositions by reacting A a relatively high molecular weight hydroxyl containing polyol and B a chain extender with C a polyisocyanate, a polyisothiocyanate or a mixture thereof. The chain extender, component B , is a mixture comprising 1 at least one of a hydroxy containing chain extenders which are free of alipha tic amine hydrogen atoms, have an average hydroxyl func tionality of from 2 to 4 and have an average hydroxyl equival ent weight of from 30 to 120 or b aromatic amine containing chain extenders which are free of aliphatic amine hydrogen atoms and which contain at least two aromatic amine hyd rogen atoms and 2 at least one aliphatic amine containing chain extender having at least one primary amine group, an average aliphatic amine hydrogen functionality of from 2 to 16 and an average aliphatic amine hydrogen equivalent weight of from 15 to 500 and wherein components A , B and C are present in quantities such that the weight percent of the theoretical reaction product of the amine hydrogen atoms of component B 2 with a stoichiometric quantity of component C based upon the total weights of components A , B and C is from 5 to 25 and the NCX index is from 0.6 1 to 1.50 1 with the proviso that when an NCX trimerization catalyst is also present, the index is up to 5 1.
