# Filter.

## Abstract
In order to make the filter sheets for a filter comprising a cylindrical, perforated core encircled by a filter sheet pleated in the shape of a concertina, the two ends of this filter sheet be ing fitted into and held by end plates, removable and adaptable to varying core geometries it is suggested that areas for fixa tion be provided at the ends of the filter sheet, these areas for fixation enclosing the majority of the pleats of the filter sheet with the exception of some pleats in at least one circumferen tial area, that the pleats in the areas for fixation be treated with a hardening resin or the like to harden the pleats in the areas of fixation in a required pitch in order to form solid and fixed areas, which fit closely to and cover the core, and that the pleats between the areas of fixation be adapted to be freely spread apart and pressed together in a circumferential direc tion so that they are adjustable to and fit onto the core.
