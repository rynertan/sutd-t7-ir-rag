The novel compounds of this invention show neuroleptic, antidepressive and antiagressive activity. Substituted l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepines have been previously described in the art, as for example, in U.S. Patent 3,393,192, British Patent 1,118,688,Danish Patent 123033, U.S. Patent 3,609,138 and U.S.Patent 4,011,319. The prior art has recognized that substituted 1 phenyl 2 ,3 ,iI ,5 tetrahydro 111 3 benzaze pines exhibit anti bacterial effects, central nervous system effects and a hypotensive effect. The novel compounds of this invention are the esters of substituted 8 hydroxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepines of the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein X is chloro, bromo or trifluoromethyl R1 is alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, l adamantyl, cycloalkoxyalkyl, alkoxy, aralkoxy, cycloalkoxy or aryloxy and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.The alkyl groups referred to above are branched or straight chain alkyl groups. R1 being alkyl may contain 1 to 20 preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The alkyl moiety contained in the other groups mentioned above e.g.aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl etc. contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. These groups can be exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the corresponding branched chain isomers thereof. The alkoxy groups likewise contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and are exemplified by methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy and the branched chain isomers thereof. Preferably these groups contain 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl groups referred to above contain 4 to 8 carbon atoms.The term aryl comprises unsubstituted phenyl and phenyl substituted by halogen, alkyl containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably one carbon atom , alkoxy containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably one carbon atom , hydroxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl or cyano.The acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I can be derived from a variety of inorganic and organic acids such as for example sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, methanesulfonic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, maleic, stearic, succinic, tartaric, fumaric, cinnamic, aspartic, acetic, benzoic, salicylic, gluconic, ascorbic and related acids.The compounds of formula I can be prepared by reacting a 7 X 8 hydroxy 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine wherein X is as defined in the compound of formula I or an alkalimetal especially sodium salt thereof with an acidR1COOH, II, wherein R1 is as defined for the compounds of formula I or a reactive derivative of the said acid. The term reactive derivative of the acid II comprises the acid halides, acid anhydrides and R1 chloroformates. Preferably the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, l adamantyl, or cycloalkoxyalkyl, are prepared using an acid halide in an anhydrous aprotic solvent in the presence of an acid acceptor.Typically, acetonitrile is used as the solvent and sodium bicarbonate as the base, but a dual function solvent such as pyridine may also be used. Other solvents include dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. Reaction temperatures and times are not critical with room temperature and 1 10 hours being preferred. The compounds of formula I wherein R1 is alkoxy, aralkoxy, cycloalkoxy or aryloxy are preferably prepared by reacting the said 7 X 8 hydroxy l pheny1 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine with the appropriate R1 chloroformate in the presence of an acid acceptor in an aprotic solvent. A preferred acid acceptor is sodium hydride while a preferred solvent is dimethoxyethane. Reaction times and temperatures are also not critical with 2 24 hours and room temperatures being most preferred.The 7 X 8 hydroxy 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepines mentioned above as starting material can for example be prepared by dealkylation of the corresponding 8 alkoxy compounds of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is alkyl and X is as defined for formula I.R is usually methyl but may also be any alkyl group containing e.g. up to 5 carbon atoms.To cleave the alkoxy group and provide the hydroxy group at position 8, the compound of formula IV may be reacted with a strong acid, such as for example aqueous hydrogen halide, preferably hydrogen bromideThe reaction can advantageously be performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction is usually carried out in an aqueous medium e.g. using 58 percent aqueous hydrobromic acid at about 75 to 100oC, preferably at reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, for about 2 to 24 hours.Other typical dealkylating procedures are the use of sodium ethanethiolate in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide at 100 1200C for 4 6 hours, or the use of pyridine hydrochloride at 200 2400C for 1 2 hours. Compound IV may be prepared by cyclization of a compound of the general formula III EMI6.1 wherein X and R are as defined for formula IV. The compound of formulatil can be cyclized utilizing a dehydrating agent such as for example polyphosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid P205, zinc chloride and hydrogen fluoride.Especially preferred are sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid P205, and hydrogen fluoride maintained at about 10 to 200C.A convenient way for preparing a compound of the general formula III comprises the reaction of a 2 phenylethylamine with ethoxyethy lbenz ene EMI6.2 in a polar aprotlc solvent such as acetonitrile, pyridine, dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted is not critical, with room temperature to reflux being preferred. Compound Iv can also be prepared by introduction of the desired 7 substituent into an 8 alkoxy l phenyl2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine containing no substituent or a replaceable substituent in position 7. Compound IV can also be prepared by N methylation of a corresponding 8 alkoxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepineEMI7.1 wherein R and X are as defined before. This N methylation is accomplished in a conventional manner, a particularly faciiitative method being the condensation of the compound of formula VII with formaldehyde and formic acid. Alternatively, methyl chloride or methyl bromide may be used to methylate the compound. The compound of formula X can be prepared by known methods, for example analogously to the methods described above for the preparation of compound IV. The compounds of formula I, as well as of formulae IV andVII and of the 8 hydroxy analog of the compound of formula IV contain an asymmetric carbon atom in position 1 chiral center . By the above described processes racemic mixtures of the relevant R and S isomers are obtained. Separation of the isomers can be effected by the usual well known techniques. If an R or S isomer of the compound of formula II or X is used as starting material in the. preparation of the desired compound I , the corresponding isomer of the compound I is obtained by the dealkylation described above.The R and S isomers can be resolved by techniques such as for example resolution by means of forming an adduct e.g. of urea , chromatography, crystallisation from optically active solvents, resolution via diastereo isomeric salts e.g. by means of N acetyl D leucine , resolution by enzymatic processes including destruction and chemical transformation of one isomer and destruction of one isomer. It is preferred to use fractional crystallization.The compounds of formula I can be transformed into pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by reaction with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or a reactive derivative thereof. Also the compounds of formula I in their free form can be set free from their acid addition salts.The compounds of this invention are typically formulated into conventional pharmaceutical compositions according to accepted procedures. The dosage of these compounds is dependent upon various factors, such as the particular compound employed and the patient s individual response.Preferably, the compositions will contain the active ingredient in an active but non toxic amount selected from about 0.8 mg to about 200 mg of active ingredient per dosage unit.The pharmaceutical carrier employed in the formulation of such compositions may be a solid or liquid. Typical carriers include, but are not limited to sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol starches such as tapioca starch and potato starch cellulose derivatives such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose, gelatin calcium phosphates such as calcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate sodium sulfate calcium sulfate, polyvinyl alcohols stearic acid alkaline earth metal stearates such as calcium stearate stearic acid vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil non ionic, cationic and anionic surfactants ethylene glycol polymers, B cyclodextrin fatty alcohols and hydrolyzed cereal solids as well as other non toxic compatible fillers, binders, disintegrants and lubricants commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations. For injectable solutions sterile water and other steril ingredients have to be used. Antipsychotic drugs are widely used e.g. in the treatment of schizophrenia. Their use is generally limited by their propensity to cause neurologic, autonomic and or endocrine side effects. The compounds of this invention are novel antipsychotic drugs. The compounds have effects common to standard antipsychotic drugs but may be regar ded as having a more generally better biological profile. Representative compounds of the invention have been found to have specific antipsychotic, antiaggression and anti depressant activity with low potential for producing extrapyramidal, autonomic and hormonal side effects the compounds did not show sedative and anti convulsant activity. On this basis the compounds of this invention are useful agents for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders due to their combination of neuroleptic, antidepressant and antiaggressive properties.The compounds are thus indicated for reducing excitement, hypermotility, abnormal initiative, affective tension and agitation through their inhabitory effects on psychomotor functions of the treated subjects. In particular these compounds are indicated as useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, mental depression, anxiety and hyperactive agitated behavioral states, particularly in mentally retarded patients. The compounds of the invention may be co administered intravenously with a narcotic to produce neuroleptic analgesia. Such a state provides sufficient CNS action to permit certain procedures e.g. bronchoscopy x ray studies, burn dressing, cystoscopy to be performed without additional medication. Addition of inhaled nitrous oxide to the neuroleptic narcotic combination would provide analgesia sufficient for surgical operations.The daily dosage of the active ingredient is dependent upon various factors, such as the particular compound employed, the condition for which the compound is administered and the patients individual response. Typical dosages for use as a neuroleptic, antidepressant or antiaggressive agent, especially in the treatment of schizophrenia, mental depression, anxiety and hyperactive agitated behavioral states, particularly in mentally retarded patients, would vary from about 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.5 to 10 mg kg per day divided in 3 or 4 doses, administered orally or parenterally.The neuroleptic, antidepressant and antiaggressive properties of the compounds of this invention may be ascertained by testing in standardized assays such as are described in Barnett, et.al., Psychopharmacologia Berl. 36, 281 290 1974 . The properties of tlie compounds of this invention can be illustrated by the following test results S 8 1 adamantanecarbonyloxy 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, has an ED50 of 17 mg kg in the anti muricide assay and an ED50 of 3.0 mg kg in the methamphetamine reversal assay. For this compound theLD50 oral dose in mice is greater than 100 mg kg.Test DescriptionsAnti muricide assay Male Long Evans rats weighing 225 250 g are housed 1 rat per cage, and killers rats show an instinctive mouse killing behavior muricide are selected initially after being deprived of food for approximately 66 hours. This is the only time the rats are deprived of food. Food, ad libitum, is avaiable on the cage floor since food bins are not practical because they afford a hiding place for mice. The rats are tested for muricidal behavior the following day and once a week thereafter non killers are always eliminated. A non killer is a rat which fails to kill a mouse placed into his cage within 5 minutes. Drugs are tested in the afternoon of the day following this weekly check for persistance of the killing behavior. Since the rats are not deprived of food or water and rarely attempt to eat the mouse, this behavior is not motivated by hunger. Four weeks after the first test for killing, the rats are injected, i.p., with placebo and then tested 30 60 minutes after the injection. Rats that do not kill are eliminated. Only rats that consistantly kill mice placed in their home cages are used for drug testing.Every treatment group is comprised of 5 rats. Each rat is presented with a CFI male albino mouse at 30 and 60 minutes after the intraperitoneal injection 1 ml kg of test drug. Blockade of muricidal behavior is determined by observing the number of surviving mice 5 minutes after being introduced into the rat cages. The result is expre ssed in ED50 values, which means that at the given dosage 50 of the tested rats do not kill mice.Nethamphetamine reversal assay Groups of 10 mice are aggregated in a 11 x 26 x 13 cm plastic chamber. Test drugs are given orally thirty minutes prior to an intraperitoneal administration of methamphetamine at 15 mg kg. This dose of methamphetamine is about 1.5 times the LD50 under these conditions and usually kills at least 90 percent of the animals. As a control perphenazine at 1 mg kg is used. this dose of perphenazine usually affords complete protection. The number of deaths in each group are counted 4 hours after administration of methamphetamine.Of the compounds defined by formula I above and its acid addition salts, those compounds are preferred wherein R1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, aralkoxy, aryl, aryloxyalkyl or l adamantyl, especially those wherein X is chloro. In particular compounds are preferred which have the S stereochemical configuration at position 1.Among these compounds are S 7 chloro 3 methyl l phenyl 8 propionyloxy 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, m.p.233 234 C S 7 chloro 3 methyl l phenyl 8 phenoxyacetoxy 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine, m.p.197 199 C S 8 benzoyloxy 7 chloro 3 metbyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, m.p.257 258 C , S 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 pheny1 8 p toluoyloxy 2,3,115 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, m.p. 249 2510C and S 8 l adamantanecarbonyloxy 7 chloro 3 methyl l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.
