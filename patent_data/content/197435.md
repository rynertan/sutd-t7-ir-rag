## Description
This invention relates to new monoclonal antibodies which are specific to surface glycoproteins of cultured choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma cells, and choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma tumor tissues. Additionally, the invention relates to panels of monoclonal antibodies which are used to phenotype these cultured cells and tumor tissues. Surface antigens are expressed on the surface of normal and malignant cells, and have been used to probe molecular events that occur during cellular differentiation, or that accompany malignant transformation. Lloyd, K.O. Human Tumor Antigens Detection and Characterization with Monoclonal Antibodies in R.B. Herberman, ed., Earlier studies have used monoclonal antibodies to detect surface antigens of different types of cancer, e.g., Dippold, et at, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. The introduction by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 of a revolutionary new procedure for the routine production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridomas allows the production of almost unlimited quantities of antibodies of precise and reproducible specificity. While conventional antisera produced by immunizing animals with tumor cells or other antigens contain a myriad of different antibodies differing in their specificity and properties, hybridomas produce a single antibody with uniform characteristics. The Köhler Milstein procedure entails the fusion of spleen cells from an immunized animal with an immortal myeloma cell line. From the fused cells hybridomas , clones are selected that produce antibody of the desired specificity. As hybridoma cells can be cultured indefinitely or stored frozen in liquid nitrogen , a constant supply of antibody is assured. Antibodies are proteins that have the ability to combine with and recognize other molecules, known as antigens. Monoclonal antibodies are no different from other antibodies except that they are very uniform in their properties and recognize only one antigen or a portion of an antigen known as a determinant. In the case of cells, the determinant recognized is an antigen on or in the cell which reacts with the antibody. It is through these cell antigens that a particular antibody recognizes, i.e., reacts with, a particular kind of cell. Thus the cell antigens are Antigenic markers may be used to observe normal processes of cell differentiation and to locate abnormalities, such as cancer, within a given cell system. The process of differentiation is accompanied by changes in the surface antigenic phenotype, and antigens that distinguish cells at different phases, or transformed cells, may be observed if a correct antibody is available. Transformation of normal cells into carcinogenic tumor cells is accompanied by changes in surface protein phenotypes. Monoclonal antibodies specific for surface proteins of carcinogenic cells may be used to identify those cells. Additionally, different cancers exhibit different surface protein phenotypes. Hence, it is possible to determine the presence of a particular type of cancer, given the proper monoclonal antibodies. By means of the monoclonal antibodies of this invention, it is possible to identify choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma cells and tissues, utilizing the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to the cell surface markers of these carcinogenic cells and tissues. Choriocarcinomas are cancers which result from transformation of trophoblasts in the case of gestational choriocarcinomas or from transformation of germ cells in the case of germ cell tumors . The transformation alters the surface antigens of the resulting choriocarcinoma, enabling one to distinguish between cancerous and non cancerous materials. Panels of monoclonal antibodies are provided which phenotypically identify choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma cells and tissues.

Immunol. Six distinct cell surface antigens of human choriocarcinoma were characterized with seven different mouse monoclonal antibodies. Six of the antibodies were generated following immunizations with cultured choriocarcinoma cells or a placenta extract AbLK26 IgG2a , AbSV19 IgG2a , AbK8 IgG1 , AbSV63 IgG1 , AbLK24 IgM , and AbK66 IgG2a . Antigen distribution was determined by MHA assays and or absorption tests with a panel of 150 human cell lines and short term cultures of fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. These results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Additionally immunofluorescence analysis of a range of normal adult and fetal tissues and tumors are shown in Tables 3 and 4. In addition, the choriocarcinoma cell lines used in this study were typed with a series of 20 monoclonal antibodies raised against restricted antigens of other human tumors and the findings with one antibody, AbS4, are presented The following is a brief description of the six antigenic systems of human trophoblast and choriocarcinoma described herein. LK26 shows a highly restricted distribution. It is expressed on all choriocarcinoma, teratocarcinoma and renal cancer cell lines. Among the other tumor cell lines tested, only a small subset of epithelial cancer lines bears the LK26 determinant, whereas leukemias, lymphomas and neuroectodermally derived tumors do not. In striking contrast to the positive LK26 phenotype of renal cancer lines, normal kidney epithelial cells lack LK26 expression. In normal tissues, LK26 is restricted to the trophoblast. All other adult and fetal tissues tested, including normal kidney, were negative for LK26. Studies on gestational choriocarcinoma and hydatidiform mole tissue show LK26 positivity. A subset of teratocarcinomas, breast and renal cancers was also LK26 positive. In immunoprecipitation tests, AbLK26 precipitated glycoproteins of molecular weight of from about 30,000 to about 35,000 daltons from extracts of ³H glucosamine and ³⁵S methionine labeled GCC SV c and OCC MM choriocarcinoma cells. SV19 is expressed on 7 7 choriocarcinoma lines titration endpoints 4 X 10 ⁵ to 1 10 ⁶ , 3 4 teratocarcinoma lines, and 4 13 breast cancer lines titration endpoints 1 X 10 ³ to 1 X 10 ⁴ . Over 120 other cell lines were SV19 negative in MHA direct tests. In absorption tests, low levels of SV19 antigen could be detected on 3 additional breast cancer lines and 5 6 colon cancer lines but not on 35 other tumor lines tested by this method 5 renal cancers, 4 bladder cancers, 9 lung cancers, 1 pancreatic cancer, 6 melanomas, 4 astrocytomas, 5 EBV transformed B cell lines, 1 normal kidney epithelial cell culture . In tissues, SV19 expression is restricted to the normal trophoblast, mammary gland epithelium and colonic epithelium. Among the tumors tested, teratocarcinomas, breast, bladder, colon and lung cancers were SV19 positive. In some additional tissues, e.g., fetal testis and fetal ovary, a distinct nuclear staining pattern was found. The relationship between this nuclear reactivity and the cell surface expression of SV19 remains to be determined. In immunoprecipitation tests with extracts of ³H glucosamine and ³⁵ methionine labeled GCC SV c cells, AbSV19 detected glycoproteins of molecular weight from about 40 to about 45,000 daltons under reducing conditions or molecular weight of about 25,000 daltons non reducing conditions . Two monoclonal antibodies, AbSV63 and AbK8, were generated against placental alkaline phosphatase. This has permitted a detailed serological analysis of a large panel of cultured cells. The results of the MHA assays on the cell panel show that SV63 is expressed on choriocarcinoma, teratocarcinoma and a subset of epithelial cancer lines. The pattern of K8 expression represents a subset of the SV63 pattern on the cell panel. In normal tissues, SV63 is found in the placenta prominent staining of the syncytiotrophoblast and weaker staining of the cytotrophoblast , intestinal epithelium and germ cells, whereas K8 reactivity is restricted to the trophoblast. A subset of teratocarcinomas expressed SV63 5 8 and K8 3 8 , and SV63 was also found in 1 4 colon cancers. The SV63 and K8 antigens were shown to have alkaline phosphatase activity using a solid phase immunosorbent assay Figure 2 . Immunoprecipitation tests with AbSV63 and AbK8 identified the antigens as glycoprotein of molecular weight of about 68,000, daltons, and sequential immunoprecipitation tests with the two antibodies revealed that in GCC SV c cells, the SV63 and K8 epitopes reside on the same molecule. 6 7 choriocarcinoma cell lines are strong LK24 expressors. LK24 is also present on most breast cancer lines and a small subset of epithelial cancer lines, as well as on EBV transformed B cells, certain leukemias and lymphomas. However, titration endpoints in MHA tests with breast cancers and lymphoid cells were more than 10 fold lower than with choriocarcinoma cells, and reactivity was limited to a small fraction 5 20 of cells within a culture. This low percentage of LK24 positive cells, which was not seen with choriocarcinomas, was unaffected by changing the density of the target cells used in MHA tests or the time between target cell plating and testing 1 to 5 days . In normal tissues, LK24 is expressed in the trophoblast, colonic epithelium, distal and collecting tubules of the kidney, urothelium and a subpopulation of cells in the fetal thymus. In the tumor panel, LK24 was found in a variety of epithelial cancers and also in lymphomas. Reactivity of cultured cells with AbLK24 is resistant to boiling 5 min at 100 C and trypsin treatment. Immunoprecipitation tests with extracts of ³H glucosamine and ³⁵S methionine labeled cells failed to show any specific components. These biochemical properties suggest that AbLK24 may recognize a carbohydrate or lipid moiety. Type O erythrocytes, but not A,B or AB, remove LK24 reactivity in absorption tests, but no agglutination was seen with either type O or type A, B, and AB erythrocytes. In the ELISA tests AbLK24 failed to show reactivity with any of the purified blood group glycoproteins and glycolipids carrying A, B, H, I, Le K66 shows an intermediate distribution on the cultured cell panel, being expressed on choriocarcinomas and many epithelial cancer lines, 5 10 astrocytomas, 1 10 melanomas and on normal kidney epithelial cells. Neuroblastomas, EBV transformed B cells, leukemias, lymphomas and five fibroblast cultures derived from adult skin and lung tissues, were K66 negative. However, two fibroblast cultures derived from fetal tissues were K66 positive. Although K66 reactivity with cultured cells was very strong e.g., titration endpoints in MHA tests on renal cancer cells 1 X 10 ⁶ to 1 X 10 ⁷ , no reactivity was seen in tests with the normal tissue panel or the tumors. Also, immunoprecipitation tests with extracts of various ³H glucosamine or ³⁵S methionine labeled cells failed to reveal any specific components. Absorption tests showed that the K66 reactivity is destroyed by boiling 5 min at 100 C or trypsin treatment of target cells, suggesting a polypeptide. The S4 antigen, which has been described by Ueda, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. LK26 is a highly restricted trophoblast antigen. It is found in the placenta but not in any other normal adult or fetal tissue tested and is expressed on trophoblastic tumors, including hydatidiform mole and gestational choriocarcinoma. In sharp contrast to the similarity in LK26 expression between normal and malignant trophoblastic cells, normal and malignant kidney epithelial cells differ with respect to this antigen. 15 15 renal cancer cell lines were LK26 positive whereas 5 5 cultures of normal kidney epithelial cells were LK26 negative. Also, tissues of normal adult and fetal kidney lacked LK26, whereas a subset of renal cancer showed the antigen. Thus, the antigen seems to be restricted to normal trophoblastic cells and certain tumors choriocarcinoma, subsets of other teratocarcinomas, and epithelial cancers . It has been speculated that some biological properties of cancer cells, e.g., invasion of tissues and metastatic spread, correspond to cellular functions normally expressed by the trophoblast during early stages of development, extinguished in the adult stage, and re expressed in cancer cells. The pattern of LK26 expression seems provocative in this respect but, clearly, further studies are needed to define the significance of this cell surface antigen. The availability of cultures of normal kidney epithelial cells LK26 negative and renal cancer cells LK26 positive from the same individuals may provide an S4 is a marker of normal and malignant kidney epithelial cells, both While S4 and LK26 represent antigens shared between trophoblastic cells and cells of renal origin, a different relationship is found for the other antigens described herein SV19, SV63 and LK24 are common to trophoblastic cells and colon and or breast epithelial cells, with SV19 being the most restricted of this group of antigens. Antibodies AbSV63 and AbK8 recognize different epitopes of the PALP molecule, and their patterns of reactivity with the cell panel are quite distinct from the LK26 pattern. The distribution of SV63 and K8 in normal tissues is in agreement with previous histochemical and immunochemical studies on the tissue representation of the different forms of alkaline phosphatase ALP which have been defined by their inhibition characteristics and heat stability, e.g., Harris, Harvey Lect. Cell surface antigens which are widely distributed on cultured human cells but are undetectable in tissues have been reported by Fradet, et al., Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci., U.S.A. The antigenic systems described herein, with the exception of PALP, differ from the cell surface antigens and secreted proteins of choriocarcinoma and normal trophoblastic cells that have been studies by other investigators as reported by Lipinski, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. The restriction of antigens LK26, S4, SV19 and PALP to only a small number of normal human tissues make them useful diagnostic markers for gestational choriocarcinomas and germ cell tumors. In addition, the reciprocal expression of SV63 and SV19 P12 in subsets of breast cancers and the presence of LK26 on renal cancer cells but not normal kidney epithelium indicate that these antigens may be of interest in the study of other epithelial cancers as well. The highly restricted distribution of LK26, which is undetectable in normal tissues other than the trophoblast, makes this antigen a possible target for immunological imaging and immunotherapy of choriocarcinoma. Different subsets of the phenotyping panel described, e.g., in Tables 2 and 3, may be used. For example, in phenotyping cultured choriocarcinoma cells, Table 2 shows that LK26 shows affinity, to one degree or another, with lung, renal, ovarian uterine, breast, teratocarcinoma, and choriocarcinoma cancer cells, and contacting a cell sample to this mAb would limit the possibilities of the identity of the cell sample accordingly. Further contact with SV19 would eliminate the possibility of the sample being lung, renal, or ovarian uterine cancer, as SV19 is distributed only on breast, teratocarcinoma, and choriocarcinoma cancer cells. Further contact with MAb K8 would eliminate the possibility of breast cancer cells, and a final contact, with LK24, would identify the cells as either teratocarcinoma or choriocarcinoma. Although LK24 antigen is distributed over more than one cancer cell type, the passage through LK26, SV19, and K8 has limited the cell possibilities to either of choriocarcinoma or teratocarcinoma. Binding to the cells of LK24 indicates choriocarcinoma, no binding indicates teratocarcinoma. Hence, the panel LK26, SV19, K8, and LK24 will determine the presence, or lack therof, of both choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma.
