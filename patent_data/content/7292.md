## Description
VALVE The present invention generally relates to valves, in particular to valves for controlling and distributing liquid streams from two connections to a third connection or alternatively from one connection to two connections.In connection with warm water systems there is a particular need of control valves of the type mentioned, for example so called shunt valves. Shunt valves may be designed as so called slide valves in which the liquid flow is controlled by using a plate provided with ports or recesses, said plate being rotatively disposed in relation to openings in a valve housing. When using this type of valve, the operation of which is performed by turning an operating shaft, it is difficult to bring about a complete sealing of one of the outlets or inlets of the valve. The valve can be arranged so that the plane slide is urged against the valve housing by a compression spring. As the contact surface between the slide and the valve housing is comparatively large, requirements are severe as far as smoothness of the slide and the valve housing is concerned. Thus, valves of this type are expensive in manufacture. Another type of shunt valve is the so called seat valve which has an axially movable slide provided with shoulders adapted sealingly to contact valve seats provided in the valve housing. The slide can be operated either by an axially movable operating shaft or by a rotary operating shaft, the rotary motion of which is transformed into an axial shifting movement of the slide. If the operating shaft is axially shiftable, problems are encountered in case electrical control motors are to be used for operating the valve because the action of such motors normally is based on a rotary function. To a certain extent this problem can be avoided if a shunt valve having a rotary operating shaft is used. Independently of which type of operating shaft is used, the important problem of seat valves resides in the fact that the slide must be urged against the valve seating by an external force applied to the operating shaft or by an external torque applied to the operating shaft. This external force or external torque respectively is produced by particular auxiliary units included in the valve. These auxiliary units tend to increase the cost of using seats valves , It is the purpose of the present invention t6 provide a valve avoiding the disadvantages of previously known control valves.Thus, the valve of the present invention does not require any auxiliary units with the aid of which the slide is held tightly against thevalve seat. Moreover, the requirements as far as manufacturing tolerances in respect to the component parts of the valve are concerned may be low without impairing the function of the valve. Not either does wear of the constructive element participating in the transmission of power between the operating shaft and the slide interfere within reasonable limits with the sealing action of the valve. The characteristic features of the valve appear from the attached claims. Some different embodiments of the valve according to the invention will be described hereafter by reference to the enclosed drawings in which Fig. 1 is a partial cross sectional view of a valve according to the invention, Fig 2 is a partial cross sect ional view along lineII II i Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a detail of the power transmission between the operating shaft and the and the slide in a valve according to the present invention. The valve according to the invention will be described in detail hereafter in the form of a shunt valve. However, the invention is not restricted to shunt valves but comprises all types of seat valves. The valve comprises a valve housing 1 having three ports of which two are provided with valve seats 2. A slide 3 is axially shiftable in the valve housing. The position of the slide may be controlled by means of an operating shaft 4 journalled in the valve housing by means of a liquid tight bushing 5. At its lower end the operating shaft is provided with a laterally offset stub shaft 6 co operating with a coupling member 7 shaped as a wedge having a central bore.The wedge, on the one hand, is placed onto the stub shaft at the bore and, on the other hand, is fitted into a conical groove 8 extending transversally of the longitudinal direction of the slide. At either end surface the slide is provided with a number of grooves 9, the geometrical shape of which is adapted to permit control of the liquid flow in the valve in dependence of the rotation of the operating shaft. At either end the slide is provided with a shoulder 10. The function of the valve may be described as follows When the operating shaft is turned the movement of the stub shaft 6 due to the excentric disposition of the stub shaft in relation to the operating shaft 4 is converted into an axial shifting movement of the slide due to the fact that the wedge shaped coupling member 7 is moved laterally of the slide while at the same time the slide is shifted longitudinally.Depending on the shape of the slide different amounts of water will flow for each adjustment of the operating shaft through the various ports in the valve housing. When the slide is moved to either of the final positions defined.by each of valve seats 2, the corresponding shoulder 10 abuts against the respective valve seat causing the liquid flow through the corresponding port to cease. A gasket is provided between either shoulder 10 and the corresponding valve seat 2.Once such contact has been established, additional turning of the operating shaft will substantially not involve additional movement of the slide but definitely a movement of the wedge shaped coupling member 7 which will slide upwardly on the stub shaft 6 while contacting either of the oblique side surfaces of the wedge groove 8. The movement along the stub shaft will take place against the action of a force performed by a compression spring 11 surrounding the stub shaft. Hereby an automatic latching of the system is obtained and in the final positions the slide will be urged against the corresponding valve seat under a power which is maintained without the application of an external moment onto the operating shaft 4.The automatic latching action is obtained by selecting the angle between the normal of the plan in which forces act between the stub shaft and the slide and the axial direction of movement of the slide within a suitable interval determined, among other factors, by the frictional properties of the surfaces. The automatic latching function is determined by the power moment acting on the operating shaft due, on the one hand, to the force acting on the end surface of the slide as a consequence of the liquid pressure and, on the other hand, the frictional forces acting between the wedge shaped coupling member 7 and the wedge shaped groove 8, said last mentioned frictional forces acting in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the slide.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention this additional turning is perfdrmed until the rotary moment acting on operating shaft 4 and emanating from the liquid pressure on the one end surface of the slide is 0, i.e. until the moment axis of the force in question becomes 0, which will happen when the angle between the axis line of the slide and the imaginary plane through the axis lines of both the operating and stub shafts 4 and 6 respectively is 0. The importance of the oblique surfaces between the coupling member 7 and the slide 3 will appear from the following considerations assume that these surfaces were not oblique but disposed at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the slide. In order to enable the slide to be moved to its end position, there will be required, in addition to, among other factors, highly exactly determined mutually distances between the operating and stub shafts, also a powerful external moment acting on the operating shaft, in particular during the last phase of the movement of the coupling member in the wedge groove when the final position is being approached.By using oblique surfaces compensation is made for distance variations between for example the stub and operating shafts while at the same time the external moment required for driving the slide towards the end position is reduced due to the fact that the coupling member starts climbing upwardly on the stub shaft and thereby reduces the frictional forces acting between the coupling member and the slide during the final phase of the rotary movement. In a suitable embodiment of the invention the wedge shaped surfaces are inclined at an angle of about 750 to the longitudinal direction of the slide. The embodiment here described of the wedge shaped coupling member 7 which is urged against the slide by means of compression spring 11, means that wear of the various parts of the valve can be compensated by a shifting movement of the wedge shaped coupling member in the longitudinal direction of the stub shaft 6. The necessary requirement for this is that an interspace is provided between the bottom surface of wedge groove 7 and the bottom surface of the wedge shaped coupling member. Vibrations and oscillations observed in conventional valves are considerably reduced in the valve according to the present invention due to the oblique surfaces and the action of a compression spring 11. Fig. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the coupling member which may be imagined to have been obtained by cleaving the wedge shown in Fig. 1 and 2 perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the slide. The two wedge halves which are placed around stub shaft 6 are provided with ont bore each receiving one end each of compression spring 10. Due to the interspace formed between the two wedge halves 7 it is possible, due to the above mentioned shifting of the wedge shaped coupling member in relation to the slide, to compensate also for wear and bad fit of the atub shaft or the arcuate surfaces receiving the stub shaft. The embodiments of the invention as described above can be mod4 4 rd and varied in many respects within the basic idea of the invention.
