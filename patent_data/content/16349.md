## Description
3 FORMYLCYPROHEPTADINE AND ANALOGS, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with 3 formyl derivatives of cyproheptadine and related compounds which are appetite stimulants and antihistaminic agents. Cyproheptadine itself and certain derivatives and analogs are known to be orexigenic and antihistaminic agents such as 3 carboxycyproheptadine in U.S. Patent 3,981,877, 3 carboxy l0,11 dihydro cyproheptadine in British Patent 1,486,847, 10 oxo or hydroxy l0,11 dihydrocyproheptadine inU.S. Patent 3,960,872. Now with this invention there are provided further novel cyproheptadine derivatives and analogs carrying a 3 formyl group and novel processes for their preparation. There is also provided a novel method of stimulating appetite and or producing an antihistamine effect in patients in need of such treatment by the administration of one or more of the novel compounds or novel pharmaceutical compositions thereof which are also provided by this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention have structural formula EMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R represents hydrogen, C13 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, especially methyl, or fluoro and the dotted line represents saturation or unsaturation of the molecule at the 10,11position. It is preferred that R be hydrogen. The novel compounds of this invention with a 10,11 double bond demonstrate atropisomerism and exist as dextro and levorotatory enantiomers. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compounds of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobronide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, pamoate, citrat e, napsylate, pyruvate, isethionate, maleate, fumolrate, or the like. The salts are prepared by dissolving approximately equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in a solven followed by crystallization of the salt produc . The novel process of this invention comprises the oxidation of the corresponding 3 hydroxymethyl compound to the 3 formyl analog.The preferred oxidizing agent for this purpose is sulfur trioxide trimethylamine complex in dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction is conducted at about 0 to 500C but preferably at about ambient temperature, in the presence of a strong base such as a tri Cl 3 alkyl amine, such as triethylamine, pyridine, or N methylpiperidine or the like, over a period of about 6 to 24 hours. In the method of treatment and pharmaceutical composition aspects of the present invention it is noted that the precise unit dosage form and dosage level depend upon the case history of the individual being treated and consequently are left to the discretion of the therapist. In general, however, the compounds of the present invention produce the desired effect of appetite stimulation when given at from about 0.01 to about 10.0 mg per kg body weight per day. The preferred form of delivery of the instant compounds for appetite stimulation of domestic animals is by solution in drinking water or performulated feedstuffs. For human and animal administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical oral forms may be employed such as tablets, elixirs and aqueous suspensions comprising from about 0.01 to about 10.0 mg of the compounds of this invention per kg body weight given daily.Thus, for example, tablets given 2 4 times per day comprising from about 0.5 to about 50 mg of the compounds of this invention are suitable for human treatment. Sterile solutions representatively given for human treatment for injection comprising from about 0.1 to about 10.0 mg of the compounds of this invention given two to four times daily are also suitable means of delivery.When an antihistaminic effect is indicated, the above recited dosage forms and levels are also appropriate. EXAMPLE 1 l Methyl 4 l0,ll dihydro 3 formyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride Step A Preparation of l methyl 4 l0,11 dihydro 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclo hepten 5 ylidene piperidine A solution of 5.0 g l methyl 4 3 carboxy 10,11 dihydro 5H dibenzo a,d3cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride in 200 ml of absolute ethanol was treated with 5 ml of boron trifluoride etherate. After stirring and refluxing for 18 hours the ethanol was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was partitioned between saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution and ether. The ether phase was separated, washed with 3 x 100 ml of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness.The residue, 5.4 g of l methyl 4 10, ll dihydro 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5H diDenzota,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine, after recrystallization from acetonitrile had m.p. 85 870C. Step B Preparation of l methyl 4 l0,11 dihydro 3 hydroxymethyl 5H dibenzola,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine A solution of 5.3 g of the ethyl ester from Step A in 200 ml of ether was added dropwise over about 30 minutes to a stirred mixture of 0.53 g of LiAlH4 and 50 ml of ether. After the addition was complete the mixture was stirred 1 hour at ambient temperature, warmed to reflux and allowed to cool spontaneously to ambient temperature. With vigorous stirring a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added alowly until a granular precipitate and a clear ether phase formed. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was added.After stirring a short time the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness to give 2.28 g of l methyl 4 10,11 dihydro 3 hydroxymethyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine, m.p. 178 1810C after recrystallization from acetonitrile.Step C Preparation of l methyl 4 10,11 dihydro 3 formyl 5H dibenzo a,di cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride A stirred mixture of 1.0 g of l methyl 4 10,11 dihydro 3 hydroxymethyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine and 6 ml of dimethylsulfoxide is treated with 4 ml of triethylamine, 6 ml of dimethylsulfoxide and 1.53 g of sulfur trioxide trimethylamine complex. The mixture is stirred bigorously for about 12 hours. Water 500 ml is added and the mixture is extracted with 2 x 100 ml of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 10 x 100 ml of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The oily residue was dissolved in 5 ml of 4N ethanolic HCl and the solution was concentrated to dryness. The residue was triturated with acetone and the crystalline product was collected, and dried to give 1 methyl 4 10,11 dihydro 3 formyl 5H dibenzo a,di cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride, m.p. 272 2760C. dec. . Employing the procedure of Example 1 but substituting for the l methyl 4 10,ll dihydro 3 carboxy 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride used therein an equimolecular amount of 1 methyl 4 3 carboxy 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten S ylidene piperidine, there is produced 1 methyl 4 3 formyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine hydrochloride. Similarly prepared are l methyl 4 10, ll dihydro 3 formyl 7 methyl 5H dibenzofa,d3cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine, 1 methyl 4 3 formyl 7 methyl 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine 1 methyl 4 10,11 dihydro 7 fluoro 3 formyl SH dibenzoLa,d3cyclohepten 5 ylideneXp√¨peridine and l methyl 4 7 fluoro 3 formyl SH dibenzota,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine.
