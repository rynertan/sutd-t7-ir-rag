# A shock or pressure wave detecting transducer assembly.

## Abstract
A transducer assembly has a head 16 and a transducer element 14 contacting the rear of the head 16 . In order to provide an output signal which has a positive value over a wide range of angles of incidence of shock or pressure waves to be detected, the transducer element 14 contact with the rear of the head 16 over a zone 22 which is smaller in cross sectional area than that of the rear of the head 16. The transducer element 14 is mounted in a metal tube 24 with a partly closed end 25 which electrically contacts the front face of the element 14 . In order to position the transducer assembly positively and to inhibit unwanted shock or pressure waves reaching the element 14 , the assembly has a series path of four interfaces of acoustic mismatch of shock or pressure waves, between said head 16 and a body portion 15 .
