# Improvements in or relating to electric motors.

## Abstract
In an A.C. electric motor such as a three phase two pole stator motor there are three stator windings, one winding for each phase. Each winding consists of a plurality of coils of which plurality half the coils forming a first group A1 ,A1, A2, A2, A3, A3 are associated with one pole and the other half forming a second group A10, A10, A11, A11, A12, A12 are associated with the other pole. In relation to a pole pitch each coil in one group has a positional counterpart in the other group. First, second and third semiconductor switch means S1, S2, S3 are arranged so that when the third switch means S3 closed and the first and second switch means S1, S2 are open all the coils of the winding are in series but when only the first and second switch means S1, S2 are closed one A10. A10 or more of the coils A10, A10, A11, A11, A12, A12 in series in the second group is are connected in parallel with its or their series connected positional counterpart coil s in the first group. Thus in parallel mode connection of the winding the number of effective turns of the winding is reduced and the magnetic flux is increased whereas in the series mode connection by the closed third switch means the effective winding turns is the sum of the turns of all the coils in both groups, and the magnetic flux is decreased. The magnitude of the supply current of one of the phases is measured and if it exceeds a predetermined value control means operate the switch means to establish the series mode connection in each of the three windings otherwise the parallel mode connection exists in all three. Thus the switching from series to parallel mode and vice versa in each winding renders the motor capable of delivering the power and torque required by the load on the motor whilst sustaining low energy losses over a typical duty cycle.
