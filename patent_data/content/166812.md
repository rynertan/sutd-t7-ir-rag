# Electrochemical generator and operation thereof.

## Abstract
An electrochemical generator which utilizes the centri fugal force produced by rotating the electrodes 14, 19 75, 76 of the generator and preferably the electrolyte to perform a variety of functions within the generator including circula tion of the electrolyte past the electrodes, circulation of air past the gas electrode 14, 75 where the generator is a metal gas generator, controlling dendrite growth and provid ing relatively dense uniform deposition of metal during recharge for a rechargeable metal air generator, keeping electrolyte and reaction products away from the pores of a gas electrode to prevent flooding or clogging of the pores, separating reaction products from the electrolyte, maintain ing uniform spacing between the electrodes as the metal electrode of a gas metal generator is consumed, flushing and draining electrolyte for standstill periods, maintaining good electrical contact between electrodes and their current collectors while still permitting easy replacement of con sumed electrodes and automatically switching electrolyte flow and other functions when the generator changes from its discharging to its charging, flushing or draining state,
