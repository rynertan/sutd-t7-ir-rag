# Process for the recovery of selenium.

## Abstract
Selenium bearing materials are treated to recover selenium in a water soluble form by a process comprising the steps of forming an aqueous slurry of the material with an alkali metal carbonate, at least 30 of the total weight of the slurry being water and the water content being sufficient to dissolve all or most of the alkali metal carbonate continuously feeding the slurry to a hot agitated pellet bed maintained in a heated pelletiser at a temperature in the range from 60 to 120 C retaining the pellets in the bed for long enough to form a wet pellet product having a pellet size not greater than 30 mm drying and roasting the pellets in an atmosphere containing free oxygen and leaching the roasting pellets with water.
