# Semiconductor device having input protection circuit.

## Abstract
This concerns a semiconductor device such as a TTL type integrated circuit device which has an input protection circuit for each inner circuit, e.g., each TTL logic gate. The input pro tection circuit is formed on a semiconductor substrate 2 hav ing a first conductivity type, and comprises a first impurity region 1 having a second conductivity type connected to an external terminal 3a and having an island shape formed on the semiconductor substrate and surrounded by an isolation region 2a having the first conductivity type a clamp diode D1 comprising an electrode layer 4 contacting the first im purity region 1 and a PN junction type protection diode D3 comprising a second impurity region 9 having the first con ductivity type which crosses the first impurity region 1 be tween the clamp diode and a portion 3 of the first impurity region 1 connected to the external terminal, and which reaches the isolation region 23a . The reverse withstand voltage of the PN junction type protection diode D3, 9 1 is smaller than that of the clamp diode D1, 4 1 thereby avoiding permanent destruction of the clamp diode.
