# Process for improving the surface properties of articles.

## Abstract
The high temperature properties of an article having at least a portion of its surface formed of an arylene sulfide polymer is improved by treating such article with a treating agent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite, sulfuric acid, chlorine, sulfuryl chloride, nitrogen dioxide, chromium trioxide, alkali metal perman ganates and nitric acid under conditions of concentration of treating agent, time and temperature to effect the desired improvement. Treated articles such as coated substrates and moldings exhibit increased high temperature surface hardness. Articles such as fibers, yarns, fabrics and films exhibit infusibility at 700 F 371 C .
