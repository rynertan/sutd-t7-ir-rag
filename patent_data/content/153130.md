## Description
The present invention relates to a moving target indicator apparatus for a radar having at least one pulse repetition period different from the other pulse repetition periods and supplying amplitude and phase components of received signals including stationary and moving clutter, the apparatus being of the comprising first clutter removing means for responding to the said radar and for removing the stationary clutter having a Doppler speed of nearly zero from the radar received signals and second clutter removing means connected to the first clutter removing means to remove moving clutter. Conventionally, a pulse radar system indicating a moving target such as an airplane is designed with clutter canceler or suppressor means to remove stationary ground clutter originating from buildings or other surface irregularities and moving clutter, such as weather clutter originating from moving reflectors such as rain or cloud, and to detect and indicate the moving target. Among these clutter removing means, a moving target indicator system, hereinafter simply referred to as an MTI system, is often used for removing stationary clutter. Generally, an MTI system adapted as a radar system for detecting and indicating aircraft is used to remove or cancel a signal originating from a stationary clutter source so as to indicate only a moving target. When the phases of transmitted R.F. pulses are compared with the phases of received R.F. pulses, the signal from a stationary clutter source always has a constant phase, whereas the signal from a move target always has different phase for each pulse repetition period. Hence, phase detection is carried out in response to signals from the same distance for the two contiguous pulse repetition periods and the difference between the video signals obtained is taken so as to cancel out the video signal originating from a stationary clutter source and to leave only the video signal corresponding to a moving target. This kind of MTI radar system is described in chapter 17, RADAR HANDBOOK , McGraw Hill, U.S.A., 1970. However, an ordinary MTI system cannot cancel out moving clutter from rain, fog, the sea surface or the like or moving ground clutter from land or the like when radar is installed on a moving carrier such as a ship, because these signals have different phase for each pulse repetition period, similar to said signals from a moving target. An adaptive MTI system is suitable for cancelling moving clutter including moving ground clutter of the kind mentioned, and for indicating only a moving target such as an airplane. Cancelling of an echo from a moving object can be accomplished by varying and transferring the Doppler frequency of the moving clutter to a notch of an MTI filter. A conventional adaptive MTI radar system of this kind is a clutter locking MTI system described in the chapter 9, RADAR DESIGN PRINCIPLES McGraw Hill, U.S.A., 1969. A clutter locking MTI system can remove moving clutter or stationary clutter by detecting an average Doppler frequency or an average Doppler phase shift and locking the average Doppler frequency or the average Doppler phase shift to a notch of the MTI filter. However, when stationary clutter and moving clutter are both present, the detected average Doppler frequency, or average Doppler phase shift, is different from that of stationary clutter alone or of moving clutter alone. The input signals of the clutter locking MTI canceler are then When one input signal is phase shifted by the presumptive value where there exists the condition of US A 3987442 describes a radar system in which in phase and quadrature signals are produced for each one of a series of range sweeps, these signals are phase compared with a reference signal to produce a pair of signals, and this pair of signals is converted into a series of complex digital words. Each complex word corresponds to a different one of a number of range cells in each one of the series of sweeps. A portion of the series of complex words of one of the series of range sweeps is combined with a portion of the series of complex words of another one of the range sweeps to produce a series of correction complex words, each one of which is representative of the average Doppler velocity of returns at a different one of the range cells. Each one of the input complex words of one of the range of sweeps is modified with a correction complex word to produce a series of modified complex words. Each one of the modified complex words is combined with a different one of the input complex words of another one of the range sweeps to reject moving clutter returns and to pass moving target returns. US A 3962704 describes a moving target indicator apparatus of the kind defined hereinbefore at the beginning in which a first canceller stage is either locked to or tracks ground clutter and a second canceller stage independently cancels offset clutter such as weather or chaff clutter. Specifically, the system described in US A 3962704 enables cancellation of clutter offset at different doppler frequencies and comprises a first canceller stage for cancellation of clutter at a first frequency and a second clutter stage for cancellation of clutter such as weather or chaff with a substantial doppler frequency offset from the first frequency. The first canceller stage comprises an in phase I unit and an in quadrature Q digital MTI unit both of which may conventional and which develop I and Q first differences, followed by a conversion of these differences into a combined first difference designated as a quantity M and representing an angle times an amplitude multiplier. Supplied with the M signal, the second canceller stage develops a second difference signal which is then normalized to represent a pure angle term. The angle term is processed by the use of a computer to generate a second difference output signal with the offset weather or chaff clutter substantially cancelled. This shows that phase correction or compensation of a phase is carried out in accordance with a Doppler frequency. According to the present invention, a moving target indicator apparatus of the kind defined hereinbefore at the beginning is characterised in that it further comprises correction means connected between first and second clutter removing means to keep the amplitude components and the phase components of the signal representing the moving clutter at the output of the first clutter removing means nearly constant in value, and in that the second clutter removing means are arranged to remove the signal representing the moving clutter with constant amplitude component and phase component from the output of the correction means. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which An embodiment of the present invention has two conventional MTI stationary clutter removing means i. e., MTI filters, connected in series and a corrector which corrects the phase and amplitude components of the output of a first stage MTI filter in order to detect a moving target in the region where both stationary clutter and moving clutter exist. Specifically, the system according to the present invention includes an MTI canceler for removing the stationary clutter, a clutter locking MTI canceler for removing the moving clutter not removed by the MTI canceler, and correcting means to correct the amplitude and phase variation caused due to a staggered trigger system. It is possible to remove moving clutter with the MTI system described above when the radar transmit repetition time is always a constant time T. In practice, however, a staggered PRF MTI Staggered Pulse Repetition Frequency MTI system is often employed to improve blind speed by varying radar transmit repetition time. This has the disadvantage that moving clutter cannot be removed because the clutter locking MTI canceler receives the input signal with a different amplitude shift and phase shift due to the repetition time difference. For example, when T₁ and T₂ are employed as a radar transmit times, stationary clutter and moving clutter signals supplied to the MTI canceller are Similarly as stated before, one input signal is phase shifted by the presumptive value of of the average Doppler phase shift of the moving clutter this input signal is shown as V₂ and is passed through the clutter locking MTI canceller. The output ΔW of the clutter locking MTI is shown Even when Hence, moving clutter cannot be removed. In the case that the radar transmit repetition time is constant as T₁ T₂ T , it is obvious from the equation 6 that moving clutter can be removed because As described above, in the staggered PRF MTI system, both the amplitude and the phase of the moving clutter in the output of the MTI canceler are varied with the Doppler frequency response characteristics. Thus, it has been hitherto impossible to remove moving clutter with a clutter locking MTI. The present invention is designed to remove moving clutter by correcting the moving clutter having amplitude shift and phase shift varied as stated above and supplying the corrected signal to the clutter locking MTI canceler. Hereinafter, it is described how amplitude shift and phase shift to be corrected should be determined by giving an example of a triple staggered trigger mode where the trigger repetition times are T₁, T₂, T₃. In a radar signal passed through an MTI canceler stationary clutter canceler , stationary clutter is removed leaving only moving clutter components. As stated before, the amplitudes and the phases of these clutter components vary in every staggered trigger repetition by virtue of the Doppler frequency response characteristics of the stationary clutter canceler. The following are the amplitude components A The phase shift components Thus, in the trigger state n 1 , where The amplitude and the phase shift components of the I and Q outputs obtained are corrected so as to have constant values without depending on the stagger trigger time. It is assumed that reference amplitude and phase values are given as A₀ and ϑ₀, respectively, and B Thus, these components are respectively made to be constant value, i.e., 2E₂A₀cosϑ₀ and 2E₂A₀sinϑ₀. In other words, the amplitude and phase components are independent of the difference of the Doppler shift fd₂ of the moving clutter and the trigger period. In the next trigger state n 2 , are given, and the following corrections similarly that with in the previous trigger state are carried out for the I and Q components. In consideration of equations 12 , 13 , the following components independent of fd₂ and the trigger time are obtained. Generally, for amplitude and phase correction in the trigger stage n m , if are assumed, the following corrections are required As a result, both components will be expressed as Fig. 1 is a vector diagram showing the above stated relationship. In Fig. 1A, A An embodiment of the present invention will now be described to illustrate the principle of this invention. In fig. 2, stationary clutter cancelers 11 and 12, composed of the well known delay circuit and subtractor circuit, remove stationary clutter from the signals I Amplitude and phase correctors 13 and 14 correct the input signal on the basis of equation 15 to obtain a signal with constant amplitude and phase and supplies the corrected signal to the moving clutter cancelers 15 and 16. The moving clutter cancelers 15 and 16, comprising the same circuit as the stationary clutter cancelers 11 and 12, remove the corrected moving clutter. Then, the I and Q component signals from which the stationary clutter and the moving clutter have been removed are combined in a I Q combiner 17 and the combined signal is output to a display not shown as an indication video signal. A phase correcting data generator 19 generates a phase variation signal Δ There will now be described an example of manually setting a presumptive value The phase correcting data generator 19 equalizes a reference phase value ϑ₀ with ϑ The amplitude correcting data generator 20 generates the following data to correct the amplitude variation in each state. The amplitude correcting value presumptive value As is clear from the equations 15 to 17 , the amplitude and phase correctors 13 and 14 give the moving clutter signal with constant amplitude and phase through processing for the amplitude component and through the processing for the phase component The embodiment shown in Fig. 2 discloses an example of generating amplitude and phase correction data through a manual operation. However, it is possible to automatically generate the correction data. Fig. 3 shows the embodiment where the correction data is generated on the basis of a presumptive value Next, the presumptive value Δ Herein, the average of N samples of the moving clutter phase shift between the distance R₀ N 2 and R₀ N 2 in the transmit trigger state n m , except the distance R₀, is regarded as the presumptive value of the average Doppler phase shift of the moving clutter. The same processing with the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 is carried out to obtain an integrated value, SIN component and COS component from the obtained presumptive value Δ An amplitude correcting data generator 20A determines according to Δ Fig. 4 is a block diagram of another embodiment for generating correction data. In this embodiment, the phase correcting data generator 19A is identical with that of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, however, the amplitude correcting data generating method is different from that in Fig. 3. An amplitude correcting data generator 20B is composed of an amplitude calculator 201B, an averaging circuit 202B and a reciprocal number calculating circuit 203B. The amplitude calculator 201B develops on receipt of the I components A Next, the reciprocal number calculator 203B obtains as the output of the amplitude correcting data generator 20B the reciprocal number of and then to supplies it to the correcting data generator 23. When the outputs of the cancelers 11 and 12 are corrected according to the correction data obtained as stated above, the phase components and the amplitude components are kept constant so that moving clutter is removed by the moving clutter cancelers 15 and 16.
