# Magnetic tape apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape apparatus having a frame 1 , two winding mandrels 34, 35 journalled in said frame, two capstans 7, 8 and associated pressure rollers 18, 19 , and a drive system whose direction of rotation is reversible for the transport of the magnetic tape in two opposite directions, there are provided switching means 26 for reversing the direction of rotation of the drive system. The switching means can be actuated by a detection system 56 which detects a stoppage of both or one of the winding mandrels while the apparatus is in operation and which detection system comprises two detection plates 74, 75 which are each frictionally coupled to a first and a second winding mandrel respectively.
