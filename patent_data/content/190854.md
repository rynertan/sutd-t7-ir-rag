# METHOD FOR PRODUCING A PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC RECORDING METHOD FOR PRODUCING A PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM MEDIUM

## Abstract
In a process involving the successive formation of a soft magnetic film substantially consisting of Fe and Ni and a perpendicular magnetic film on a plastic substrate, the soft magnetic film is vacuum deposited while its formation position is irradiated with an ion beam so as to prevent cracks and lessen coercive force. Apparatus for carrying out the deposition of the soft magnetic film includes a vacuum chamber 8 divided by a partition 7 into an upper chamber 9 and a lower chamber 10 which can be exhausted through outlets 11 and 12 . The film substrate strip 6 is fed from a roll 1 round a cooled drum 3 to a winder 5 . An evaporator 16 contains an iron nickel ingot 15 , and ion beam radiation issues from the source 17 . A screen 13 has an aperture 14 which limits the incident angle of the ion beam onto the position of the substrate 6 passing round the drum 3 .
