# Four speed ratio transverse automatic transmission.

## Abstract
An automatic transaxle for use in an automotive vehicle driveline for delivering torque from an engine to the vehicle traction wheels comprising two simple planetary gearsets 138 and 140 adapted to provide four forward driving ratios and a single reverse ratio and including three friction clutches 88, 184 and 186 , three friction brakes 136, 178 and 164 and one overrunning clutch 186 that are strategically arranged to provide optimum spacing between the ratios and smooth ratio changes with minimum shift timing problems for the ratio changes.
