# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium for perpendicular magne tic recording comprises a low coercive force material 2 , and a magnetic recording layer 3 which is formed on the low coercive force layer 2 and has magnetic anisotropy perpen dicular to the surface of said low coercive force layer 2 . The magnetic recording layer 3 is chosen to have 0.3 Âµm or less in thickness.
