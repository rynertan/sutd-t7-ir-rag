# DRIVE MECHANISM FOR A TORQUE CONVERTER

## Abstract
A drive apparatus 10 includes a drive member 11 and a connected driving ring gear 23 rotatable about a first axis 21 for supplying power to a torque converter 13 . A compact speed change mechanism 16 interconnects the driving ring gear 23 and torque converter 13 and includes a driven ring gear 25 connected to the torque converter, and a support device 17,20,32,50 . The support device 17,20,32,50 rotat ably supports the driven ring gear 25 on a second axis 27 offset from the first axis 21 , and the meshed ring gears 23,25 have a preselected tooth differential to effect a speed change therebetween. The support device includes a support member 17 having a portion 18 journalled in the drive member 11 , and an arm 50 on the support member is rotationally fixed while it is allowed to have a preselected amount of play movement.
