## Description
The invention relates to an electrical connector assembly in which an electrical terminal is releasably retained in an insulating housing and to an electrical terminal for such assembly. There is frequently a requirfflment for electrical connector assemblies in which electrical terminals are releasably retained in insulating housings and it is often important that such assemblies not only provide a stable mounting for such terminals but also permit limited float of the terminal to permit mating of misaligned terminals without overstress. In addition, release of the terminals from the housings should be effected conveniently. A prior electrical connector assembly disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 52 22595 comprises an insulating housing formed with a terminalreceiving passageway extending between a rear face and a mating face, a wall of the passageway being formed with an axially extending groove at the rear face to define a terminal admitting mouth of keyhole section, forwardly facing terminal retaining shoulders being formed in the passageway on each side of Lhe groove a terminal formed with a retaining portion between a mating end and a conductor connecting portion, the retaining portion comprising a pair of resilient flanges which extend adjacent each other outwardly of the terminal, the terminal being received mating end first in the passageway with the flanges having been resiliently flexed togethe√Ø in the groove and engaging the shoulders in a snap action releasably to retain the terminal in the passageway A disadvantage of the prior assembly is that it may not completely satisfy both requirements for a stable mounting and limited float of the terminal.In addition, insertion of a releasing tool along the passageway from the mating face of the assembly would normally be necessary to release the terminal requiring prior unmating of mated connector assemblies and relatively difficult and time consuming manipulation. According to the invention, a transverse bore intersects the passageway adjacent the mouth to define the terminal retaining shoulders in a cavity receiving the flanges which have first substantially parallel portions and second portions which extend rearwardly from the first portions in a plane parallel to the terminal axis and in mutually divergent relation. Interengagement of the flanges and the cavity wall provides stable mounting whilst permitting limited float of the mating end. In addition, the transverse bore provides ready access for a terminal releasing tool to the retaining portion without a need for access to the mating face of the connector assembly. According to another aspect of the invention, an electrical terminal for the connector assembly described above comprises a retaining portion between a mating end and a conductor connecting portion, the retaining portion comprising a pair of resilient flanges which extend adjacent each other outwardly of the terminal and, is characterised in that, the flanges have substantially parallel first portions and second portions which extend rearwardly from the first portions in a plane parallel to the terminal axis and in mutually divergent relation. A specific example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view partly in cross section of an electrical connector assembly according to the invention Figure 2 is a plan view of a rear end of a connector housing of the assembly with an electrical terminal according to the invention partly inserted therein Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a similar view to Figure 2 showing the terminal fully inserted into the housing Figure 5 is a similar view to Figure 4 showing a portion of a terminal releasing tool operatively aligned to release the terminal and, Figure 6 is a perspective view of an alternative socket terminal according to the invention. The connector assembly includes a housing 10 moulded in one piece of plastics material with a front mating face 12 enclosed by a shroud portion 14.A series of terminal receiving passageways 16 extend from the mating face 12 to the rear of the housing and are arranged in two rows on respective opposite sides of a rearwardly extending wall 15. Rearwardly extending portions 18 of the passageways are of open channel section for mass termination and, if desired, may be closed by a cover, not shown. In an alternative embodiment, where mass termination is not required, the portions 18 of the passageways may be closed by an integral top wall. An upper wall of each passageway 16 at a rear face 22 is formed with an axially extending groove 20 to define a terminal admitting mouth 21 of keyhole section. A bore 24 extends from a surface of the housing adjacent the face 22 to intersect the passageway 16 to define a retention cavity with terminal retaining shoulders 25 on each side of the groove 20 at a rear end and a tapering portion 27 towards a front end. A terminal 26 received in each passageway comprises a mating end which can be a pin 28 as shown in Figures 1, 2, 4 and 5 or a socket 30 as shown inFigure 6. Each terminal includes a rear conductor connecting portion 32 including a pair of spaced parallel, side walls 34 and 36 each having inwardly turned ends 38, 40 and 42, 44, respectively, defining between them a pair of axially spaced slots adapted to penetrate the insulation and to effect electrical connection to the conductive core of an insulated wire 46. Each terminal also includes a pair of crimping ears 48 and 50 for strain relief. The operation and construction of the conductor connecting portion 32 is described in U.S. 4,243,288 9269 . As shown particularly in Figure 6, the terminal is formed, preferably integrally, with a retaining portion comprising a pair of adjacent outwardly extending flanges 52 and 54 having substantially parallel first portions 53 and 55, respectively, and second portions 56 and 58, respectively, which extend rearwardly from the first portions in a plane parallel to the terminal axis and in mutually divergent relation. The terminals are assembled with the housing by insertion, mating end first, through the mouths of the passageways 16 where the flange portions 56, 58 are resiliently flexed together by the walls of the grooves 20 and subsequently engage the shoulders 25 of the retention cavity in a snap action as shown in Figure 4. The terminals can be released from the cavities by inserting a bifurcated tool 60 with the bore 24 to compress the second portions 56 and 8 to the width of groove 20 to permit passage therethrough. It should be noted that the interaction of the retaining portion and the retention cavity walls provides good terminal orientation and stable mounting whilst permitting limited float of the terminal to permit mating of misaligned terminals without overstress which is particularly important in matable connector assemblies having a large number of terminals. In addition, access is possible to the conductor connecting portions without affecting the accessibility or release of the retaining portion. The retaining portion also permits close spacing of the terminals. The connector assembly is reasonably economical to manufacture.
