# Road marking compositions.

## Abstract
The inclusion of a substantially saturated dicarboxylic acid, anhydride or ester substituted with at least one hydrogen and carbon containing group of at least 30 carbon atoms and optionally an acidic C₂ and or C₃ olefin polymer or copolymer of molecular weight 500 to 30,000 having an acid number from 30 to 300 wt. of a resin in a resin based hot melt road marking formulation containing aggregate gives a formulation of improved colour and melt viscosity.
