# A method of copolymerization in suspension of ethylene with straight chain alpha olefins to obtain low density copolymers.

## Abstract
A method of copolymerization in suspension of ethylene with straight chain alpha olefins so as to obtain low density copolymers in two copolymerization steps in an aliphatic hydrocarbon medium having a boiling point above 40 C. In the first reaction step the medium is supplied with a high activity Ziegler catalyst on a carrier and with ethylene and the alpha olefin. The copolymerization reaction is carried out for between 20 seconds and 30 minutes and at a tem perature between 45 and 65 C. The resulting copolymer is used in the second reaction step as a nucleus for polymeriz ing ethylene and the alpha olefin, the reaction medium being supplied with additional quantities of ethylene and alpha olefins so as to maintain the concentration of alpha olefin in the reaction medium at between 4 and 25 by weight per 100 parts by weight of reaction medium and so as to maintain the pressure of ethylene at between 5 and 20 bars, the reaction being performed at a temperature between 50 and 80 C for between 1 and 3 hours.
