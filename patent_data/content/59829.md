# Data storage transfer system.

## Abstract
A data transfer storage system includes host processors 12 which act as utilization devices, a peripheral subsystem 10 having a buffer 15 with buffer segments and devices 13 , which act as data source sinks. Data transfers between respective buffer segments and data source sinks, such as peripheral data storage devices are scheduled as a series of transfers based upon most recent, next most recent, etc. usage of the buffer segments by a utilization device. An MRU LRU list of segments ordered by such usage is dynamically maintained. Replace ment of segment allocations among devices proceeds from the least recent used, next least recent used, etc. segments. Therefore, the single list controls replacement, read ahead prefetch of data from devices to the buffer and transfer of data from the buffer to the devices all based on utilization of the buffer by the utilization device.
