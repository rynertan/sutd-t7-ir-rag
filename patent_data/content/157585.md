# Stack system.

## Abstract
A guyed stack has a system of hozizontal rings and vertical struts surrounding it to which the guy wires are attached. The rings and struts allow free expansion and contraction of the stack. The vertical struts support the vertical components of the guy tensions. The stack supports wind induced bending moments and shear forces. Friction between the stack surface and the horizontal rings under wind induced motion act as a damping mechanism to suppress the motion and reduce the risk of dymamic instability.
