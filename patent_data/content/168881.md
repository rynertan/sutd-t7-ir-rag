## Description
OXA FENCHYL ESTERS AND AMIDES OF ALPHA L ASPARTYL D PHENYLCLVClNE John M. Janusz John M. Cardlik TECHNICAL FIELD The present application relates to oxa fenchyl and like esters and amides of alpha L aspartyl D phenylglycine useful. as high intensity sweeteners. Sweeteners are used in a variety of orally ingested prodducts For example, sweeteners are an Important component of cakes, cookies, chewing gum, dentifrices and the like. Sweeteners are a particularly important ingredient In beverages. In terms of volume, carbonated beverages use more sweeteners than any other sweetened product category. The most widely used sweetener for food, and especially beverage products, is sucrose. Sucrose is safe, naturally occurring, and has a high sweetness quality in terms of a pure, quick onset of sweetness with no aftertaste or undertaste. However, the normal usage of sucrose provides significant caloric load which is undesirable for those persons on weight control or reduction programs. Also, those persons who have diabetes must carefully control their intake of sucrose to avoid problems associated with the disease. Sucrose is also cariogenic so that it cannot be used in dentifrices and is undesirable in chewing gums.Additionally, and perhaps little realized, for the amount of sweetness delivered, sucrose can be expensive relative to other sweeteners such as saccharin, especially when used in carbonated beverages. The drawbacks of sucrose, including its expense, have led those in the beverage industry to seek substitute sweeteners.One particularly Important quality sought in such sweeteners is high sweetness intensity. Sweetness intensity can affect not only the safety profile and caloric value of the sweetener, but also its cost in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness. However, the inability to predict that a given compound is sweet, and particularly that it has high sweetness intensity, makes the search for suitable substitute sweeteners a hit or miss proposi tion. Such unpredictability is especially true for the currently popular L aspartic acid derived sweeteners represented by the following formula EMI2.1 where X is O ester or NH amide . Various theories have been proposed for what imparts sweetness to these particular molecules. However, the current belief is that groups R1 and R2 need to be dissimilar in size for greatest sweetness intensity, i.e.one group large or bulky, the other group small. See Coodman et al., Peptide Sweeteners A Model for Peptide and TasteReceptor Interactions, Proc. 15th Eur. Pep. Symp., 1974 , pp.271 78 Sukehiro et al., Studies on Structure Taste Relationships of Aspartyl Peptide Sweeteners Syntheses and Properties ofL Aspartyl D Alanine Asides, Science of Human Life, Vol. 11, 1977 , pp. 9 16. It also appears that when R1 Is the large or bulky group, the stereochemical configuration generally needs to be L, L for sweetness. See U.S. Patent 3,972,860 to Moriarty et al., issued August 3, 1976 L aspartyl L phenylglycine lower alkyl esters are sweet U.S. Patent 3,492,131 to Schlatter, issued January 27, 1970 L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters are sweet . Conversely, when R1 is the small group, the stereochemical configuration generally needs to be L, D for sweetness. See U.S.Patent 4,411,925 to Brennan et al., issuedOctober 25, 1983 L aspartyl D alanine amides are sweet Ariyoshi et al., The Structure Taste Relationships of the Dipeptide Esters Composed of L Aspartic Acid and Beta Hydroxyamino Acids, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jap., Vol. 47, 1974 , pp. 326 30 L aspartyl D serine esters are sweet . Even with these guidelines, the sweetness intensity of these L aspartic acid derived sweeteners can vary greatly depending upon which combination ofR1 and R2 groups are selected. Compare U.S. Patent A,411,925, supra X is NH, R1 is methyl group, R2 is 2,6 dimethyl cyclohexyl group, sweetness Intensity is 600 times that of sucrose , with U.S.Patent 3,907,766 to Fujino et al., issuedSeptember 23, 1975 X is 0, R1 Is methyl ester group, R2 is fenchyl group, sweetness Intensity is 22,200 33,200 times that of sucrose . For beverage use, the substitute sweetener must be sufficiently soluble and hydrolytically stable. Most carbonated beverages have a pH I of from about 2.5 to about 4.8. Useful sweeteners in such beverages must therefore be relatively resistant to acid catalyzed breakdown. Otherwise, the beverage can quickly lose its sweetness or possibly have undesirable off flavors imparted to it. As In the case of sweetness intensity, it can be difficult to predict whether a given sweetener will be hydrolytically stable, especially In an acidic environment. Other factors are also important in providing a useful substitute sweetener. To obtain approval for food or beverage use, the substitute sweetener must be safe in terms of acute toxicity as well as long term effects from continued use. The substitute sweetener should also desirably approach sucrose in terms of sweetness quality, as well as have a relatively quick onset and short duration of sweetness. Finally, to be classified as a noncaloric sweetener, the substitute sweetener or metabolic products thereof should provide minimal or no caloric value at normal usage levels. The most widely used substitute sweetener at present is saccharin, in particular its sodium salt. Saccharin has a relatively high sweetness intensity about 300 times that of sucrose and is relatively inexpensive in providing sucrose equivalent sweetness in carbonated beverages. However, saccharin also provides an undesirable lingering bitter aftertaste. Besides saccharin, a number of the L aspartic acid derived amides have been proposed as suitable substitute sweeteners. The most prominent examples are the alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters, in particular the methyl ester known as aspartame. Aspartame has been approved for use in dry foods and beverages, and has recently been approved for use in aqueous beverage systems such as carbonated beverages. The sweetness intensity of aspartame Is about 150 200 times that of sucrose with a sweetness quality approaching that of sucrose.The caloric value of aspartame is also relatively minimal at normal usage levels. However, aspartame Is hydrolytically unstable in most carbonated beverages. Perhaps more important to the beverage industry, aspartame is extremely expensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness delivered. The search therefore continues for substitute sweeteners which are 1 inexpensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness 2 are hydrolytically stable in carbonated beverage systems 3 are safe 4 have satisfactory taste quality and 5 provide minimal caloric value.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to certain alpha L aspartyl Dphenylglycine esters and amides useful as sweeteners. These esters and amides include the non toxic salts and have the formula EMI7.2 wherein the ester or amide is the L,D stereochemical isomer wherein X1 is O or NH wherein R is a phenyl group having the formula EMI7.3 wherein A, B, C, D and E are H, OH, F, Cl, Br, or C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy and wherein R is selected from the group consisting of bicyclic radicals having formulas a b and c EMI8.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are H, or C1 C alkyl, hydroxy S alkyl or alkoxy provided that at least one of R2, R3, R4 and R5 are C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy, X2 is O p and q are 0, 1, 2 or 3 and the sum of p q is not greater than 3 x is 1, 2 or 3 y and z are 0, 1 or 2 and the sum of y z is not greater than 2. These al pha L aspa rtyl D phenylg lycine esters and amides are more hydrolytically stable in carbonated beverages than aspartame. Also, certain of these esters and amides have sufficiently high sweetness intensity so as to be relatively inexpensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness. Based on available data for the expected metabolites, it is believed that these esters and amides are safe for use in food and beverage systems, and will provide minimal caloric value at normal usage levels. The taste quality of these sweeteners is also satisfactory. A. Alpha L aspartyl D phenylglycine esters and amides The esters and amides of the present invention have the formula EMI9.1 It has been determined that the L,D stereochemical isomer imparts the sweetness character to these esters and amides. However, minor amounts of the D,L, L,L and D,D stereochemical Isomers can be tolerated without adversely affecting the taste quality ofL,D stereochemical isomer. Such diastereomeric mixtures typically comprise at least about 50 of the L,D stereochemical isomer, preferably at least about 70 of the L,D isomer, and most preferably at least about 95 of the L,D isomer. The esters or amides of the present invention can be in the form of non toxic salts. As used herein, non toxic salts means salts of the present esters and amides which are physiologically acceptable for ingestion. Such salts Include both cationic and acid addition salts of these esters and amides. By cationic salts is meant those salts formed by neutralization of the free carboxylic acid group of the instant esters and amides by bases of physiologically acceptable metals, ammonia and amines. Examples of such metals are sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Examples of such amines are n methyl glucamine and ethanolamine. By acid addition salts is meant those salts formed between the free amino group of the instant esters and amides and a physiologically acceptable acid.Examples of such acids are acetic, benzoic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, citric, fumaric, gluconic, lactic, maleic, malic, sulfuric, sulfonic, nitric, phosphoric, saccharic, succinic and tartaric acids. The compounds of the present invention can be in the form of either esters or amides X is O or NH . The amides are desirable from the standpoint of having greater hydrolytic stability than the esters. However, the esters have acceptable hydrolytic stabillty and in particular have a hydrolytic stability greater than that of aspartame. Also, in terms of sweetness intensity, the esters tend to have a greater sweetness intensity. The phenyl group R of the esters or amides of the present invention has the formula EMI10.1 wherein A, B, C, D and E are H, OH, F, Cl, Br or C Cq alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy. Preferred groups R are those where A,B, C, D and E are all H or where one of A, B, C, D and E isOH or F. Particularly preferred groups R are phenyl A, B, C D and E are H , p hydroxyphenyl C is OH A, B, D and E areH and o fluorophenyl A is F B, C, D and E are H . The terminal group R can be selected from a variety of bicyclic radicals. The first group of such radicals have the formula a EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are H or C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy provided that at least one of R2, R3 and R4 are C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy X2 is O p and q are each 0, 1, 2 or 3 the sum of p q being not greater than 3 and x is 1, 2 or 3. Preferably R2, R3 and R4 are methyl or H Rt is preferably H the sum of p q is preferably 0 x is preferably 2.Especially preferred radicals of formula a are alpha7 oxa fenchyl and beta 7 oxa fenchyl. A second set of such radicals have the formula b EMI11.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X2, p, q and x are defined as before and R5 is H or C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or alkoxy. PreferablyR2, R3, R4,and R5 are methyl or H R1 is preferably H the sum of p q is preferably 0 x is preferably 2. A third set of such radicals have the formula c EMI12.1 wherein R, R2, R3, R4, X2, p and q are defined as before and y and z are 0, 1 or 2 and the sum of y z is no greater than 2.Preferably, R2, R3 and R are H or methyl R1 Is preferably H the sum of p q is preferably 0 the sum of y z Is preferably o or 1. B. Sweetness Intensity of Alpha L Aspartyl D PhenylglycineEsters and Amides The sweetness intensity of the esters and amides of the present invention relative to sucrose can be determined according to the following procedure Male subjects are chosen at random from a group of about 20 persons who have previously been selected on the basis of proven tasting acuity, i.e., persons who could easily recognize the four basic tastes sweet, sour, bitter and salty and who are adept at quantifying their own physiological response numerically. The subjects are asked to taste and expectorate about 10 ml of a test sample temperature of about 22 C having dissolved therein the ester or amide. The subjects are then asked to compare the sweetness of the test sample with five standard samples which contain increasing amounts of sucrose.The standard samples are letter coded A, B, C, D and E and are designated on a ballot by a closed linear scale. Sweetness intensity of the test sample is recorded by the subject making a mark on the linear scale at a point he considers equal in sweetness among the standard samples interpolation between standardsIs encouraged. After completion of the panel, a five point numeric scale is superimposed on the linear scales to obtain numerical data data is averaged and recorded to the nearest 0.25 unit. Equivalent sucrose sweetness is determined by referring to graphs of w v sucrose concentration in the standard samples versus a linear numeric scale. Sweetness intensity is calculated by dividing the concentration w v of perceived sweetness by the concentration w v of the ester or amide required to produce that sweetness. The five point scale with standard samples ranging from 1.37 0.040M to 11.978 0.35 M sucrose is used for sweetness intensity testing. The test sample is prepared at a concentration which would be equal to about 8 108 sucrose.
