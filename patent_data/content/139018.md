# Magnetic transducer head assembly having a single magnetic pole type for perpendicular mode recording.

## Abstract
A single magnetic pole type of composite magnetic head for perpendicular recording comprises a prependicular re cording reproducing head unit and an erase head unit. The perpendicular recording reproducing head unit consists of a main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 made of a thin film of a sort magnetic material of which one end faces a magnetic recording medium 11 , and which has a predeter mined width non magnetic guard members 12a 12b which clamp, from both sides, the surface of the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 which faces the magnetic recording medium a magnetic core part 13a which is integrated with the non magnetic guard member 12a and is positioned a predetermined distance away from the magnetic recording medium 11 in contact with at least one surface of the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 and a groove part 15 provided in the magnetic core part 13a which separates a first auxiliary magnetic pole part 14a in contact with the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 and a return path part 14b acting as a return path for the magnetic flux of the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 , and about which a winding is provided on the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 . On the other hand, the erase head unit is composed of a pair of main erasing magnetic poles 18a 18b which are positioned a predetermined distance away from the main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 in the direction of travel of the magnetic recording medium 11 , facing the medium, and are arranged so that the distance therebetween is smaller than the width of the main recording reproducing main magnetic pole 10 and an erasing winding 21 exciting the main erasing magnetic poles 18a 18b . The main recording reproducing magnetic pole 10 and the main erasing magnetic poles 18a 18b are integrated with each other by the non magnetic guard member 12b at the surfaces thereof which face the magnetic recording medium. Thus there is no possibility that previous data is left unerased when rewriting, even if a track deviation occurs because of some misalignment of the magnetic recording medium 11 in loading, or the expan sion and contraction thereof due to changes in temperature or humidity, and it is possible to obtain accurate data during reproduction.
