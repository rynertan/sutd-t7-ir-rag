Preferred solvents are aprotic solvents, such as the halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene dichloride, chloroform, or the aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, toluene and acetonitrile. A preferred solvent is methylene dichloride. The reaction temperature is, e.g. from about 50 to 300C, especially from 200 to 200C. The reaction is run, e.g. from about 10 minutes to 18 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to 3 hours.The product may be recovered by conventional techniques. However, the compounds of the formula II are suitably not isolated but used in situ in the preparation of the final compounds. In step c the compound of the formula VI is reacted with an oxidising agent such as potassium permanganate or, preferably, chromium trioxide, suitably under acidic conditions.Preferred acids include the mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid, acetic acid or especially sulfuric acid. A suitable solvent is acetone, especially acetone in combination with a small amount of water, although the combination of water and other inert solvents, such as diethylether, may also be employed. The temperature of the reaction is preferably from about 400 to 300C, especially from 100 to 50C. The reaction is run from, e.g.about 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 2 to 3 hours.

Many of the compounds VIII are known or may be prepared by conventional techniques, e.g. metal organic displacements of halogen on silicon. The compounds of formula III, V and IX are either known or may be prepared in conventional manner from available materials. The compounds of formula IV, VI and VII, in which R1 represents C5 22 alkyl, particularly C818 alkyl, are novel and also form Dart of the present invention. Of more particular interest among said novel compounds are those in which any branching of R1 is on other than the carbon atom and also those in which R1 is straight chain C5 22 alkyl, particularly Cg 18 alkyl and especially those in which R2 and R3 are both methyl. It will be understood that the compounds of formula I may exist in the form of optically active isomers, e.g., enantiomers, which can be prepared from optically active compounds III or separated and recovered by conventional techniques, i.e., resolution. Such isomeric forms are also included within the scope of this invention. The compounds of formula I of this invention possess pharmacological activity. In particular the compounds of the formula I are indicated for use in controlling the chloresterol ester content of mammalian arterial walls and are therefore particularly indicated for use as anti atherosclerotic agents,t.e. agents useful in the prophylactic treatment of atherosclerosis and in the controlling of atherosclerotic conditions due to chloresterol ester accumulation in the arterial walls. Such ability of the compounds of the formula I is indicated by known test procedures in which the total chloresterol ester content of cultured cells is shown to be reduced by a test compound, as compared to untreated cells, and carried out, for example, by the following procedures A CELL CULTURE Rhesus monkey smooth muscle cells from the arterial, e.g., aorta, wall obtained by the method of K. Fischer Dzoga et al. Experimental and Molecular Pathology 18, 162 176 19730 are routinely groin in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks usingMinimum Essential Medium Eagle supplemented with 10 foetal bovine serum.For testing a 75 cm flask with a near confluent cell growth is selected. The cells are removed from the flask surface by mild enzymatic treatment with pronase. After centrifugation and decanting the enzyme solution, the cell pellet is resuspended in an appropriate volume of media for seeding the desired number of 60 mm tissue culture dishes.Five 5 ml of the diluted cell suspension are pipetted into each dish. After seeding, the dishes are labelled with the cell type, date and flask number of origin and incubated at 370C in approximately 5 C02 atmosphere in a high humidity incubator.When the cultures are confluent, the actual drug testing is begun. Test compounds are routinely solubilized in 100 ethanol. An equivalent amount of ethanol is added to control groups as well. The tissue culture dishes are randomly divided into groups.To one group, hyperlipemic rabbit serum HRS is added at 5 by volume control . To the remaining groups, 5 HRS and 0,1 to 1 mg per 100 ml of media of the test compound are added. The dishes are returned to the incubator for an additional 24 hours.All operations through to the final incubation are performed using sterile technique in a laminar flow hood. After the incubation period, the dishes are microscopically observed with the Zeiss Axiomat with phase contrast optics and the conditions of the cultures are recorded especially in regard to the size, number and configuration of cytoplasmic inclusions and to cellular morphology. The media is removed from the cultures and 0.9 sodium chloride solution is added. The cells are removed from the flasks with the aid of a rubber policeman and transferred to a conical granuated centrifuge tube. The cells are washed three times by suspending in an isotonic salt solution, centrifuging at 800 x g for 10 minutes and aspirating the supernatant fluid. B CELL EXTRACTION PROCEDURE An appropriate volume of isopropyl alcohol about 1 ml mg protein is then added to the cell pellet and the sample sonicated with a micro probe 140 x 3 mm for 10 seconds with a LO setting of 50 on a Bronwell Biosonik IV. After centrifugation for 15 minutes at 800 x g, the clear supernatant is decanted and an aliquot taken for cholesterol analysis.The residue is dissolved in 0.lN sodium hydroxide and an aliquot taken for protein determination by the method of Lowry et al. J. Biol. Chem. 193 , 265 1951 . C ASSAY Free cholesterol The isopropyl alcoholic solutions of standards, samples and blank isopropyl alcohol alone are treated in a similar manner. An aliquot of 0.4 ml of free agent ReagentA, Table 1 below is added to a 10 x 75 mm disposable glass test tube to which 20 1 of the isopropyl alcoholic solution is added and mixed. After standing at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes, 0.8 ml of 0.5N sodium hydroxide ReagentC, Table 1 is added and mixed. The fluorescence is measured with an Aminco Bowman Spectrophotofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and emission wavelenght of 415 nm. A 1 cm light path cuvette is used with a Xenon lamp, an IP28 Photomultiplier tube and 2 mm slits. Total cholesterol The same procedure described above for free cholesterol is followed for total cholesterol except that the total reagent Reagent B, Table 1 is used instead of the reagent and the samples are incubated for 20 minutes at 370 C before the addition of the 0.5N sodium hydroxide solution Reagent C, Table 1 . Alternatively, the assay for cholesterol, i.e. Step C above obtained from Steps A and B , may be carried out by the method of Ishikawa et al J. Lipid Res. 15, 286 1974 . The amount of cholesterol ester is found by subtracting the amount of free cholesterol from the total cholesterol content of the cells determined by the assay. A finding of a lower amount of cholesterol ester in the group of cells to which the test compound was added, as compared to the control group untreated shows that the test compound is active in reducing the cholesterol ester in the cells.
