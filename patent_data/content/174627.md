# Measuring instrument for concentration of gas.

## Abstract
A gas concentration measuring instrument using the dependency of the propagation velocity of ultrasonic wave propagating in gas on the gas concentration incorporates a dampproof ultrasonic sensor 43, 53, 56, 68 with a metal or the like deposited by evaporation on the surface of the sealing material 51 . Therefore, this gas concentration measuring instrument is almost not affected by the change of temperature and humidity and can precisely measure gas concentration continuously for a long period of time under high humidity. The ultrasonic sensor is formed fundamental ly by an ultrasonic vibrator 45 , a holder 44 and a sealing material 51 . More preferably, this sensor is embeded in a block 67 and sealed with an elastic sealing material 75 and a film of conductive material and or a nonconductive mate rial is formed on the surface of the sealing material, the elastic sealing material, the vibrating end surface 71 of the ultrasonic sensor 68 and the end surface 72 of the block.
