## Description
This invention relates to DNA molecules comprising artificially constructed polynucleotide sequences substantially corresponding to all or a portion of a Of the four species of In many countries malaria has become a more severe disease problem over the last decade. This is due to several factors which include the breakdown in malaria control programs, the emergence of insecticide resistance in the mosquito vectors and most importantly the emergence of strains of Like other As in the liver cell the parasite matures within the RBC and undergoes asexual multiplication to produce numerous merozoites which when released into the blood, upon rupture of the infected RBC, can invade another RBC and initiate another asexual cycle. For reasons that are not clearly understood, occasionally maturation within the RBC results in the formation of male or female gametes. When these sexual stages are ingested with a blood meal by a mosquito they fuse to initiate a process of sexual reproduction the end result of which is thousands of sporozoites in the salivary gland of the mosquito each capable of reinfecting a human being. The immune response to malaria infection is complex. Both antibody and cell mediated immune responses occur and responses are directed against components of several of the life cycle stages. The sera of putatively immune individuals contain antibodies recognizing over a hundred different polypeptide antigens in asexual blood stages of There is a considerable body of evidence that indicates that the asexual blood stages of A system for the continuous culture of the asexual blood forms of Using the techniques developed over the last ten years it is now possible to introduce the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid coding for non bacterial proteins into bacterial cells via the intermediary of a plasmid or bacteriophage, see for example Burrell, C.J. et al, Many non bacterial genes have been inserted and multiplied within bacteria such as One approach to the production of vaccines for inducing immunity against Plasmodia antigens, disclosed in European Patent Applications Nos. 0062924 and 0071705, both in the name of The Wellcome Foundation Limited, has been based on the use of monoclonal antibodies to define certain antigens by molecular weight and immunofluorescence staining pattern, and to isolate these antigens for use in immunisation. The present invention, however, is based on an entirely different approach in using recombinant DNA techniques in the production of antigenic polypeptides. The present invention provides for the synthesis of individual polypeptides substantially equivalent to naturally occurring The invention also provides for the synthesis of According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recombinant DNA molecule comprising an artificially constructed nucleotide sequence substantially corresponding to all or a portion of a In an alternative embodiment, the nucleotide sequence may code for all or a portion of at least two The particular sequence shown in Figure 1 has been identified as corresponding to a portion of the S antigen of It will be appreciated that the artificially constructed polynucleotide sequences of this aspect of the invention may correspond to a naturally occurring sequence, or they may be related by mutation, including single or multiple base substitutions, deletions, insertions and inversions, to a naturally occurring sequence, provided always that at least one polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of an antigenic polypeptide of The nucleotide sequence may have expression control sequences positioned adjacent to it, such control sequences being derived either from In yet another aspect, the invention provides a recombinant DNA cloning vehicle capable of expressing at least one polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of all or part of an antigen of In a further aspect, there is provided a microbial host cell containing a recombinant DNA molecule, e.g. a recombinant DNA cloning vehicle or vector, as hereinbefore described.

After treatment with nuclease S1 the ds cDNA was methylated with EcoR1 methylase and ligated to 0.5 µg of phosphorylated EcoR1 linkers with T4 ligase. The mixture was then treated with 20 units of EcoR1 for 90 min. at 37 and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1 agarose gel in 50mM Tris, 20 mM NaOAc 2mM EDTA pH 8.2. DNA between 0.6 and 2.0 kb was recovered by electrophoresis on to Schleicher and Schuel NA45 membrane filter and elution in 1M NaCl, 50mM free base arginine at 70 C for 1 hr followed by ethanol precipitation and aliquots 20 ng were ligated to EcoR1 cleaved λgt10 DNA 1 µg , packaged into phage and plated on DNA 5 µg from pBR322 was cleaved with EcoR1 and BstN1.

The 1.7kb fragment was recovered and ligated to 1 µg of XbaI cleaved gt11 Young, R. and Davis, R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, in press DNA and packaged as above. DNA 500 µg prepared from plate stocks of the λgt10 cDNA library grown on Uncut λAmp3 DNA 50 µg in 100 µl was ligated for 4 hr at 15 to seal and protect the cohesive ends from subsequent phosphatase treatment. The ligase was then inactivated at 70 for 10 min, NaCl and Tris HCl pH 7.4 were added to 50mM and 100mM and the DNA cleaved with EcoR1 500 units for 4hr.

Colonies were replicated to nitrocellulose filters Hanahan, D. and Meselson, M. Gene Serum was collected with informed consent from adults free of Protein extracts of induced λAmp3 Our strategy for construction of an expression library from To prevent religated parental molecules predominating in our library the EcoR1 cut λAmp3 vector was treated with phosphatase. Because this markedly reduced the cloning efficiency, we first amplified the cDNA by cloning it into the phage vector λgt10 Fig.3 . DNA from the λgt10 cDNA phage pool was cleaved with EcoR1 and the released cDNA was isolated and ligated to phosphatase treated EcoR1 cleaved λAMP3 DNA to generate the final expression library. This procedure resulted in a library of 5 x 10⁴ lysogenic Amp R colonies of which 98 were lac and 50 hybridized detectably to ³²P cDNA from To detect colonies expressing antigens of Antibodies from immune individuals in the endemic Madang area of Papua New Guinea were used to detect The result of such a screen on a filter containing about 10³ λAmp3 cDNA colonies is shown in Fig. 4. Several colonies have apparently reacted with the IgG, giving signals of varying intensity. No such variation is seen with normal IgG although both IgGs give a background reaction with all colonies. Clones in the area of the signals generally 3 10 colonies were plated for single colonies and picked at random in triplicate, so that some should be positive with the remainder providing negative controls. A significant proportion again reacted with the immune IgG but not with normal IgG. The signals were reproducible in the triplicates and the intensity of positive signals in any row all of which derive from the same original positive was characteristic. We tested a replica of the colonies shown in Fig 5A by colony hybridization with ³²P cDNA to establish whether the positive clones contained We examined proteins from lysates of induced antigen positive and negative clones by gel electrophoresis. Staining with Coomassie blue revealed that some clones, both antigen positive and negative, produced abundant quantities of unique polypeptides larger than β galactosidase e.g. clones Ag13, Ag23 and C9 in Fig. 6 . When the proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose by the Western blotting procedure and scored with anti β galactosidase serum, these unique large polypeptides all reacted strongly Fig. 6 . Polypeptides of lower molecular weight were also evident. These may be degradation products or they may be generated by internal initiation or premature termination. When Western blots were scored with the affinity purified anti In a third class of clones, no reactive polypeptides were demonstrable with immune human IgG. This may be the result of extensive degradation, or may reflect inability of the polypeptide to retain antigenicity after boiling in NaDodSO₄. We cannot rule out the possibility that these latter clones are false positives in the colony screening system. Of 78 antigen positive Bacteria harvested from 1 litre cultures were resuspended in 20 ml Tris buffer 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl and lysed by the addition of 0.25 mg ml lysozyme and incubating for 30 min. To the bacterial lysate was added Triton X 100 final concentration 0.2 , an equal volume of Tris buffer, containing 20 mM MgCl₂ and 1 ug ml DNase Deoxyribonuclease, Grade I, Boehringer Mannheim, FRG . After incubating at room temperature for 10 min cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 x g. The 4,000 x g supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 x g to sediment the insoluble fusion protein together with other particulate material. The pellet was solubilised in 5 ml of 0.1 M NaPO₄ buffer, pH 6.4, containing 2 sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS and 10 mM dithiothreitol DTT by boiling for 2 min and loaded on to a column of Sepharose CL6B Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden which was equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 M NaPO₄ buffer, pH 6.4 containing 0.1 SDS and 1 mM DTT. Aliquots of the fractions eluting from the Sepharose column were examined by 1 dimensional SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE . Those containing the fusion protein were pooled, desalted by passage over a PD10 dialysing column Pharmacia equilibrated with 1 mM β mercaptoethanol in H₂O and freeze dried. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly with freeze dried fusion protein 0.5 mg suspended in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline PBS and emulsified in an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant. The rabbits received a second injection 4 weeks later with 0.5 mg of the same antigen emulsified in Freund s incomplete adjuvant and were bled for antiserum 2 weeks later. Antisera were also raised in mice. In this case the bacteria from approximately 1 ml. of an induced culture were lysed in phosphate buffered saline by 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, emulsified in an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally and subcutaneously into female BALB c mice. The mice received a second injection 4 weeks later with the same amount of bacterial lysate without added adjuvant, and subsequently bled for antiserum. Antigens released into the culture medium by Antiserum raised against the fusion protein isolated from clone Ag16 rabbit anti Ag16 serum was tested for reactivity against The cDNA insert of clone Ag16 was subcloned into the phage vector M13.mp9 Messing J., Crea R., and Seeburg P.H. 1981, Nucl. Acids. Res., Using the procedures described in Example 1, clone Ag16 was identified as an antigen positive This fusion protein was insoluble and could be enriched for by lysing induced organisms and centrifuging down insoluble material. This pellet was solubilized by heating in a buffer containing 2 SDS and 10 mM DTT and a single passage over a Sepharose CL6B gel filtration column provided fusion protein free of the majority of proteins in the original A rabbit immunized with the semi purified fusion protein obtained from clone Ag16 produced antibodies that reacted with clone Ag16 and not other Conclusive evidence that the Ag16 clone corresponded to a portion of the isolate FC27 S antigen was obtained by Western blotting experiments. Isolate FC27 has an S antigen Mr 220,000 which is the dominant antigen detected when culture supernatants are analysed by the Western blotting procedure using selected sera from naturally immune Papua New Guineans. One clonal population E12 of Anti Ag16 serum was used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments to demonstrate that the corresponding antigen in isolate FC27 was associated with mature asexual stages in the red blood cell. The staining pattern Fig.10 in which the merozoites inside the segmented schizont were clearly outlined is consistent with the S antigen being located within the parasitophorous vacuole and perhaps also on the merozoite surface. The processes used in Example 1 for preparing recombinant bacteria phage and for selecting E.coli clones making malaria antigens, and in Example 2 for characterising one clone with respect to the parasite antigen it corresponds, to were repeated so as to identify clones producing other antigens of Available nucleotide sequence data on one of these additional clones is given in Figure 2. Information concerning the molecular weight, stage and strain specificity and ultrastructural localisation of these antigens is given in Figures 11 14 and in Tables 1 4.
