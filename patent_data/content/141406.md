# Continuous cycle electroplating plant.

## Abstract
A continuous cycle electroplating plant for a plating loose metal items, the plant including a multiplicity of sequentially arranged processing units which comprise at least one pre treating unit, one or more electroplating units and at least one passivating or coloring unit. Each processing unit comprises a barrel 2 mounted for rotation on a support structure 15 , a spiral 8 rigid with, and extending along and around, the inner side wall of the barrel. Thus, the spiral 8 acts, in use, as a spiral conveyor for moving the metal items from an inlet end 3 of the barrel 2 to its outlet end 4 , and treating means such as a liquid solution for processing the metal items while being moved in the barrel 2 .
