## Description
The present invention relates to novel imidazo 4,5 c pyridine derivatives having positive inotropic activity. Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and sympathomimetics have been widely used for many years for the treatment of heart failure. It is, however, well known that these compounds suffer from a number of disadvantages which limit their use in practice as described, for example, by Opie L.H., Drugs and the Heart V and VII, Lancet 1980, i, 912 and 1011 Editorial, Treatments for heart failure Stimulation or unloading, Lancet 1979, ii, 777 and Braunwald E., Pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular disorders in Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine, p. 1064, ed. Isselbacher We have now discovered that imidazo 4,5 c pyridine derivatives of formula I below possess advantageous inotropic properties which render the compounds useful for the treatment of heart failure while avoiding or obviating problems associated with the use of previously proposed inotropic agents. The present invention thus provides compounds of the general formula wherein x is 0 or 1 and acid addition salts thereof. It will be appreciated that formula I may be depicted in the alternative tautomeric form wherein x is as defined above . Thus, references herein to formula I should be taken to include, where appropriate, references to the above mentioned alternative tautomeric form. Compounds similar to those of formula I , namely 2 4 methoxyphenyl and 2 4 dimethylaminophenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridines, are disclosed in USSR Patent Specification 566842. 2 3 Chlorophenyl , 2 4 chlorophenyl , 2 2 hydroxyphenyl and 2 4 aminophenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridines are described by R.W. Middleton and D.G. Wibberly, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 17, 1957 1980 . 2 2 Aminophenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridine is disclosed by Haskell et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1970, 13 4 , 697. These references do not, however, disclose or suggest the use of the compounds for the therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body. Furthermore, similar compounds are described in U.S. patents No. 4,281,005 and 3,891,660. The present invention also includes the acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I . These salts may be formed by protonation of one or more of the basic nitrogen atoms in formula I . It will be appreciated that for therapeutic use a physiologically acceptive acid addition salt will be required, for example, a salt derived from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, malic, maleic, fumaric, citric, sulphuric, lactic or tartaric acid. A preferred S O The compounds according to the invention are useful as cardiotonic agents since they have been found in both From A further advantage of the compounds according to the invention is that they do not demonstrate any significant myocardial phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity. This contrasts with reports for sulmazole which find this compound to be an effective inhibitor of myocardial phosphodiesterase Diederan and Wiesenberger, 1981, Drug Res. 31 1 , 177 82 . Phosphodiesterase enzymes are widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body and the administration of an inhibitor, which is inherently non specific, may result in phosphodiesterase inhibition at sites other than the myocardium, which may be undesirable from the clinical point of view. The stimulation of myocardial Î² adrenoceptors results in an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP, as does the inhibition of myocardial phosphodiesterase. The resultant positive inotropic effects of these interventions are directly linked to the increased levels of cAMP and thus an inotropic stimulation based on either mechanism may be criticised for the same reasons. Both mechanisms are likely to promote myocardial ischaemia through increasing myocardial oxygen demand by their positive chronotropic effects, and in addition evoke arrhythmias. In experimental studies it has been found that 2 2 methoxy 4 methylsulphinyl phenyl 1H imidazo 4,5 c pyridine hereinafter named A does not exacerbate myocardial injury following selective ligation of the coronary artery The compounds according to the invention also possess an inhibitory effect on blood platelet aggregation which could facilitate the treatment of heart failure by providing some protection against the effects of platelet interaction in the myocardium, particularly after infarctions. A particularly preferred compound by virtue of its advantageous pharmacological properties is A and its physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. The compounds of formula I and their salts may be administered by the oral, rectal or parenteral route. In general, these compounds may be administered at a dosage in the range of 1 to 1200 mg per day although the precise dosage will naturally depend on a number of clinical factors, for example, the type i.e. human or animal , age, and weight of the subject, the condition under treatment and its severity, and the particular compound employed. For administration of the compounds by the oral route, a dosage regime of 100 to 400 mg, e.g. about 200 mg per day may be used, while for administration by the parenteral route, especially intravenously, a dosage regime of 20 to 300 mg, advantageously 35 to 70 mg, e.g. about 50 mg per day is generally preferred. The compounds may be administered intravenously by infusion, if desired, in which case, a dosage rate of, for example, 1 4 mg min may be employed. The compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts are preferably administered in the form of pharmaceutical formulations. The present invention thus further provides pharmaceutically acceptable formulations comprising at least one compound of formula I as defined above or a physiologically acceptable acid addition salt, in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for oral, parenteral particularly intravenous or rectal administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which may comprise one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oil in water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one ore more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agent. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powder, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose, as hereinabove recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents. The compounds of formula I and their acid addition salts may be prepared by any convenient process, e.g. using procedures described in the above mentioned references. Thus, for example, according to a further feature of the present invention, we provide a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I as defined in claim 1 or an acid addition salt thereof, which comprises The reaction in process a may optionally be carried out in a solvent, e.g. an organic solvent for example, ethylene glycol, conveniently at a elevated temperature, e.g. up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. According to a preferred embodiment of process a above according to the invention, a compound of formula II wherein either X and Y both represent amino groups is reacted with a compound of formula III wherein X is as hereinbefore defined and Z is a carboxyl, thiocarboxyl or dithiocarboxyl group or a functional equivalent thereof e.g. an acid halide, acid anhydride, amide, thioamide, imidate, thioimidate or ester thereof or an aldehyde or nitrile thereof. When a compound of formula III is employed, wherein Z represents a free carboxylic acid group, the reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as phoshorous oxychloride. Alternatively, the reaction may be effected in the presence of polyphosphoric acid. When a compound of formula III is employed, wherein Z represents an acid halide, the reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. a tertiary base such as triethylamine. Where a nitrile of a compound of formula III is employed, the reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of an acid, e.g. p toluene sulphonic acid or polyphosphoric acid. Alternatively, a compound of formula III wherein Z represents an aldehyde group may be effected for example, as described by R. Weidenhagen et al., Chem, Ber. 1942, In one example of the preferred embodiment above, the compound of formula II may be reacted with a thioamide of a compound of formula III , e.g. a thiomorpholide which is advantageously employed in the form of a quaternised product thereof, e.g. the appropriate S methyl thiobenzyl morpholide iodide. Alternatively, the compound of formula III may be employed in the form of a morpholide. A further preferred embodiment of process a according to the present invention comprises reacting a compound of formula II wherein one of X and Y represents a halogen atom and the other represents an amino group with a compound of formula III wherein X is as hereinbefore defined and Z represents an amino containing group derived from a carboxyl group, e.g. a Hâ NCO group . In process a , the Z group in the compound of formula III may react sequentially with groups X and Y in the compound of formula II , e.g. with the initial formation of a compound of formula wherein x is as hereinbefore defined which may subsequently be cyclised, e.g. by treatment with lead tetraacetate to form a compound of formula I . Compound A may be prepared for example by oxidation, e.g. using hydrogen peroxide, organic peracids, or bromine or one of its addition compounds, e.g. an alkali metal hypobromite, as described in German Offenlegungsschrift DE 3044 497 of the corresponding methylthio compound. The acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. by treatment of the free base with an appropriate acid. The following Examples illustrate the present invention. A mixture of 2,4 dimethoxybenzoic acid 2.5 g and 3,4 diaminopyridine 1.5 g was ground to a fine powder and added portionwise to phosphorus oxychloride 50 ml with stirring. The mixture was stirred and heated under reflux for 2.5 hours before excess phosphorus oxychloride was removed In an analogous manner to that described in Example 1, the following compound was prepared To a mixture of acetic acid 20 ml , water 6 ml and hydrogen peroxide 30 solution 2.5 eq , while stirring at room temperature, was added, in portions, the compound of Example 2 1.5 g . The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and allowed to stand overnight at 4 C. Tlc indicated that the reaction was complete. The resulting mixture was poured into water 25 ml , basified with 0.88 ammonia and extracted with chloroform. The organic extract was dried, decolourised and evaporated In an alternative preparation, the title compound was prepared as follows Compound A was suspended in ether and dry hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled through the suspension for about 2 minutes. The insoluble solid was filtered off and dried to give the title compound as a white solid, m.p. 153 155 C. The following Examples illustrate pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention wherein the active compound may be any compound of formula I defined above, for example, Compound A. Mix the active compound with the lactose and the sodium starch glycollate. Granulate the mixture with a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone in 50 aqueous alcohol. Dry the granulate and mix in the magnesium stearate. Compress to tablets of average weight 226 mg. Mix the active compound with the lactose and the starch. Granulate with a solution of the methylcellulose in water. Dry and mix in the stearic acid. Fill 238 mg into a hard gelatin capsule. Dissolve the active compound in the Water for Injections. Sterilize the solution by passage through a membrane filter, 0.2 Âµ pore size, collecting the filtrate in a sterile glass receiver. Fill into sterile glass 2 ml vials under aseptic conditions and secure with aluminium seals. The injection is reconstituted before administration by the addition of a convenient volume of Water for Injection or sterile saline solution when a large volume infusion is required. Dissolve the benzyl alcohol in Water for Injection. Add and dissolve the active compound. Make up to volume with Water for Injection. Pass through a membrane filter, 0.2 Âµ pore size, collecting the filtrate in a sterile glass receiver. Fill into sterile glass vials. Close the vials with sterile rubber closures and secure with aluminium seals. Melt the suppository base at 40 C. Incorporate the active compound in fine powder form in the molten base and mix until homogeneous. Pour the mixture into suitable moulds, 2 g per mould and allow to set. Male guinea pigs Halls 275 350 g having been allowed free access to food and water were killed by a blow to the head. The heart was rapidly excised and washed with Krebs Henseleit solution containing the Î² adrenoceptor antagonist carazolol 5 x 10 â¸ M and gassed with 95 Oâ 5 COâ at 34 C. The heart was transferred to a petri dish containing the same buffer kept at a constant temperature 34 C throughout the dissection. Fresh buffer was used for each dissection and washings were discarded after use. A single right ventricular papillary muscle was employed from each heart the tendinous end ligated to a stainless steel hook and the lower end ligated and cut away from the ventricle wall and attached to a perspex clamp such that the tissue was in contact with a platinum punctate electrode. The stainless steel hook was suspended from a Grass FT.03 transducer which recorded isometric tension. The preparation was placed in a 20 ml pyrex organ bath containing buffer gassed with 95 Oâ 5 COâ and maintained at 34 C. 500 mg leading tension was applied to the preparation. Stimulation was effected by rectangular pulses of 1 msec duration at 1.5 Hz at 30 above the threshold voltage 1 5 volts by a SRI stimulator. The transducer inputs were coupled to a potentiometric recording device by a 6 channel Grass transducer coupler. After 90 minutes, preparations unable to sustain uniform contractions beyond this period were rejected. After observing both a stable baseline and contractile force usually 15 minutes additions of test compounds were made in a cumulative fashion in 0.5 logââ unit intervals over the range of 10 â¹ M to 10 Â³ M final bath concentration or the limit of solubility whichever is the greater. Compound A was tested and found, in the concentration range 10 â´ M to 10 Â³ M, to have positive inotropic activity and to be capable of eliciting at least 75 increase in the basal contractile force F Compound A was tested in comparison with amrinone and sulmazole. In anaesthetised, open chest beagles, bolus intravenous injections of the test compound see Table below produce a dose related positive inotropic stimulation as measured by the increase in the rate of change of the left ventricular pressure dp dt over the dose range of 0.003 3.0 mg kg. This is accompanied by a dose related increase in aortic blood flow, and a fall in systemic blood pressure see Table below . The effective intravenous dose of compounds to produce a 50 increase in dP dt EDââINO and a 30 decrease in diastolic blood pressure EDââVASO in anaesthetised open chest beagles. The determination of phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity was effected by a procedure based on that of Thompson and Appleman Biochem., Rhesus monkeys of both sexes 7.3 9 kg, body weight were sedated with phenylcyclidine, subsequently anaesthetised with thiopentone and maintained with sodium pentobarbitone. Catheters were placed in the left femoral artery to record blood pressure and in the left femoral vein for administration of drugs. A further catheter was placed in the contralateral femoral artery for the removal of blood samples. Heart rate was recorded from ECG standard lead II . A left ventricular catheter was introduced via the left carotid artery to measure left ventricular pressure. All cardiovascular parameters were displayed on a polygraph Grass, model 7D . Rectal temperature of the anaesthetised monkey was maintained at 37 38 C via a heated table pad. In preliminary toxicity studies, the effects of intravenous administration of Compound A see above to female Wistar rats has been determined. Animals were randomly distributed into groups of five, each group receiving a single administration of drug. One group served as a control and received the vehicle only. Observations on behaviour were made at 5 minutes and 20 minutes, at 1, 3, 4 1 2 hours and at 2, 4, and 6 days following drug administration. The findings of these studies are tabulated below.
