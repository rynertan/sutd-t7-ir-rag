# Plastisol compositions.

## Abstract
This invention relates to plastisol compositions for use in rigisols and containing a PVC paste resin s having an ISO viscosity number between 100 and 160, at least one butyl phthalate and at least one alkyl benzene. The rigisols thus produced have the desired viscosity stability in spite of the relatively inexpensive plasticizer esters used. The rigisols impart a hard, inflexible finish to products coated therewith and is particularly suitable for use on toys.

## Description
PLASTISOL COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to plastisols containing a butyl phthalate suitable for use in rigisols. A Irigisol is a plastisol i.e. dispersion of PVC resin in plasticisers together with heat stabilisers etc which are so compounded that the fused end products are relatively hard and inflexible at normal temperatures. In formulating a rigisol, plasticiser selection is of great importance. It must confer sufficiently low plastisol viscosity to facilitate normal processes spreading, rotational moulding, dipping etc without conferring a soft or flexible finish to the end product. The following examples illustrate the applications of rigisols. a Components of children s dolls with a hard finish. Plastisol is metered into a mould which is then rotated in 3 dimensions as it passes through a processing oven. The mould is split and the article removed. b Stiff chemically blown PVC foams. These are used in self supporting leathercloth which is used in the manufacture of suitcases etc. Formulations for this application would be similar to formulations used for a with the addition of a chemical blowing agent such as azodicarbonamide. Plasticisers capable of giving low plastisol viscosity combined with a hard finish are often aliphatic dicarboxylic esters, such as e.g. di isodecyl adipate and 2,2,4, trimethylpentane 1,3 diol diisobutyrate. Such esters give plastisols with relatively slow fusion rates requiring relatively high temperatures to achieve complete fusion. Attempts have been made to develop plasticiser blends which contain a high proportion of a fast fusing plasticiser, e.g.di isobutyl phthalate hereafter referred to as DIBP to avoid this defect. Di isobutyl phthalate has the advantage of being less expensive than other fast fusing plasticisers such as e.g. n butyl benzyl phthalate, di propylene glycol dibenzoate, but in common with other plasticisers of this type it confers relatively high plastisol viscosity and poor viscosity stability. We have found that the viscosity of a DIBP containing plastisol can be greatly reduced by replacing a portion of the DIBP with an alkyl benzene. Accordingly, the present invention is a plastisol composition suitable for use in rigisols, said composition comprising a dispersion of a paste forming polyvinyl chloride resin or resins having anISO viscosity number of between 100 and 160 in a plasticiser mixture of a butyl phthalate and at least one alkyl benzene, the phthalate and the alkyl benzene being present in the plasticiser mixture in a ratio by volume of betwen 90 10 and 40 60 respectively. The butyl phthalate may be di n butyl phthalate, di iso butyl phthalate or mixtures thereof. Di iso butyl phthalate is most preferred. The alkyl benzene in the plastisol composition may be selected from a mono 7 di or tri alkyl benzene and diphenyl alkanes and may have straight or branched chains containing between 7 and 17 carbon atoms. The alkyl benzenes may be light alkylates which are produced by oligomerisation of lower olefins followed by alkylation of the benzene nucleus. One such example is dodecyl benzene which is a branched propytene tetramer alkylate. These alkyl benzenes may be used singly or as a mixture. The volume ratio of di isobutyl phthalate to alkyl benzene in the plasticiser mixture is preferably between 80 20 and 60 40. The paste forming polyvinyl chloride resin dispersed in the mixture may be produced by any of the conventional methods of emulsion or micro suspension polymerisation. The resin, whether used alone or as a blend with one or more other resins, must have an ISO viscosity number between 100 and 160. The dispersion of the resin s is suitably prepared by mixing the ingredients in any of the various types of industrial mixers conventionally used for the production of such plastisols. The ratio of the paste forming resin or the blend of such resins to the plasticiser mixture in the composition is suitably between 100 25 and 100 70, preferably between 100 30 and 100 50 by weight. In addition the plastisols may contain minor amounts of other conventional plasticisers such as the higher dialkyl phthalates, e.g. n butyl benzyl phthalate , 2,2,4 trimethylpentane 1,3 diol di isobutyrate, phosphates such as triaryl phosphates, e.g.tritolyl phosphate, chlorinated hydrocarbons, e.g. chlorinated diphenyls and the like. The plastisols may also contain other conventional additives such as heat stabilisers and epoxy esters. Where an expandable plastisol is used for producing stiff chemically blown polyvinylchloride foams, it may contain a blowing agent. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Example.Example Plastisols of the following composition were mixed in a laboratory planetary mixer and de aerated under vacuum. The plasticiser levels were selected to give approximately the same viscosity. The control plastisol contained a general purpose plasticiser, di octylphthalate, for comparison.
