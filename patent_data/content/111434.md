The funnel element 2,4 is moved stepwise forwardly by means of the tractor to consecutively provide the necessary space in the hose for the next bale to be introduced. The tractor loader may be provided with equip ment for applying a treating fluid to the bales during the handling thereof, and the bales, thus treated, are then stored in a practically sealed manner in the said sheet hose.
