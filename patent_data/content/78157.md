# Bearing assemblies for spindles.

## Abstract
A bearing assembly for a spindle shaft comprises a housing 2 adapted to be secured in a support member 6 , said housing 2 having arranged coaxially therein a cylindrical cavity 10 , a first cylindrical aperture 12 between said cavity 10 and the exterior of a first end of said housing, and an at least partially threaded second cylindrical aperture 16 between said cavity 10 and a second end of said housing, said second aperture 16 being of equal or greater diameter than said cavity 10 . The cavity 10 has arranged therein coaxially therewith, in abutting relation and of outside diameter sufficiently less than the diameter of said cavity to allow sliding movement therein, and in order from said first end, a spacer 18 , a first sealed radial bearing 20 a second spacer 24 , and a second sealed radial bearing 22 , each of said spacers being of generally cylindrical configuration and of an inside diameter such that the spacers abut the edge of only the outer races of the bearings 20, 22 . The second aperture 16 has threadably engaged therewith an end plug 26 having a cylindrical aperture 27 therethrough coaxial with said second aperture 16 , and of larger diameter than the inner diameter of said bearings, the face of said plug 26 having a cylindrical protusion 50 thereon to abut the edge of only the outer race of said second bearing 22 . The spacers 18, 24 , bearing 20, 22 and end plug 26 are of predetermined width such that said end plug 26 holds said bearings 20, 22 and said spacers 18, 24 against the wall of the first end of said cavity 10 to thereby prevent axial movement of the bearings within said assembly. A bearing assembly and a spindle unit utilizing that assembly have now been developed which allow for disassembly for replacement of parts, such as individual failed bearings.
