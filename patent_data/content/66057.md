# Shunt wound control for on road vehicle.

## Abstract
A power control system for a DC electric motor includes a control power regulating means which selectively connects either the armature of the motor, the field winding of the motor or both in a series current path with a DC power source permits operation of the motor in either an armature current or field current control mode using a single regulat ing circuit. In the field current control mode a contactor connects the armature of the motor directly across the power source and the regulating circuit controls the field current to regulate torque developed by the motor. The armature circuit and field circuit are interconnected by a diode which permits electronic switching between armature current con trol and field current control modes of operation.
