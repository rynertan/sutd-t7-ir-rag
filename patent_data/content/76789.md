# Arrangement for stabilizing an excentric bearing bush for a printing cylinder bearing, in a bearing hole which rotatably receives the bush in a printing press side frame.

## Abstract
For moving a printing cylinder to and from its operating position its journal stub is carried in an excentric ring 5 via a bearing, said ring being in turn rotatably mounted in a bearing hole 7 in the side frame of the printing press. The outer surface of the ring 5 has a basically circular shape. The hole 7 is circular. The outer surface of the ring 5 is ground off along a lesser circumferential portion. The junctions S between the circumferential portions of the ring 5 form support ridges, by means of which the ring 5 rests against the wall of the hole 7 . A motor 20 ensures that the ring 5 rests, via the junctures S , against the hole wall 7 . The junctions S are situated just outside the limits for the range of movement described by the resultant to the forces which are transferred from the ring 5 to the hole wall 7 .
