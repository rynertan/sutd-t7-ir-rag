## Description
The present invention relates to an epitaxial layer structure grown on a graded substrate and a method of epitaxial growth on the graded substrate. At present, mixed crystals of various semiconductor material such as GaAlAs, InGaAsP, InGaAlAsP and ZnCdSSe are used as epitaxial layer for a semiconductor device, which is grown on a substrate of a similar mixed crystal. In the case of InGaAsP quaternary crystal, for example, it is possible to achieve a wide range of energy bandgaps from 0,36 e Generally speaking, if a crystal having a lattice constant different from that of the substrate is grown on the substrate, a lot of misfit dislocations are introduced from its interface into a grown layer, which undermines the crystal quality of the grown layer. Consequently, the surface condition of the grown crystal is also adversely affected, making it impossible to obtain usable crystals. Since the epitaxial layer should be lattice matched to the substrate, possible bandgap range of the epitaxial layer depends on the composition of the substrate. For instance, when the InGaAsP layer is grown on an InP substrate with a lattice match condition, the bandgap range is restricted to 0,75 e To this end, so called graded substrate is commercially available see DE A 22 49 858 . The graded substrate comprises a binary bulk single crystal substrate, a graded composition layer formed on the binary substrate, and a constant composition layer formed on the graded composition layer. A typical example of such a commercially available GaAs Furthermore, from GB A 2030767 a crystal structure is known comprising a single crystal bulk substrate, epitaxial layers, a constant composition layer and an epitaxial layer, whereby there is an intentional lattice mismatch between the epitaxial layer and the constant composition layer of 3.3 x 10 ³. However, the lattice constant of the epitaxial layer is a greater than that of the constant composition layer. It is the object of the present invention to provide a crystal structure having a graded substrate and an epitaxial layer grown on the graded substrate and a method making the same with a good surface condition and crystal quality. This object is achieved by a semiconductor structure as defined in claim 1 and by a method of growing an epitaxial layer on a graded substrate as defined in claim 2. The present invention is featured in that an intentional lattice mismatch is introduced between the epitaxial layer crystal and the graded substrate surface by the value of Δa a 1 x 10 ³ to 5 x 10 ³ Δa a difference in the lattice constant between the top layer of the graded substrate and the grower layer thereon, Double heterojunctions DH structures for semiconductor laser diodes are prepared for the following respective cases a conventional case where lattice match is carried out on a graded substrate in which a mixed crystal of GaAS An epitaxial layer may be grown by the hydride vapor phase epitaxy VPE method. A GaAsP graded substrate consists of a bulk single crystal, a graded composition layer grown thereon, and a constant composition layer thereon. As the bulk crystal, approximately 300 µm thick GaAs bulk single crystal was used. The graded layer is a grown layer in which 30 µm thick composition is changed by small degrees from GaAs The n type InGaP clad layer was Se doped by approximately 7 x 10¹⁷ cm ³ as an n type dopant, while the p type InGaP clad layer was Zn doped by approximately 2 x 10¹⁸ cm ³ as a p type dopant, respectively. The InGaAsP active and cap layers were undoped. A comparison was made between the case where the above described DH structure for laser diodes LD were grown on the constant layer of GaAs In the case where lattice match was effected, the composition of each grown layer was In Meanwhile, in the case of the present invention in which intentional lattice mismatch was introduced in the direction of alleviating a strain which is internally present in the graded epitaxial substrate, the composition was In As a result of preparing DH structure for various LD₉, observation by the Normalsky differential interference microscope revealed that many fine irregularities occurred on the surface of the lattice matched epitaxial layers, and a deteriorated specular surface was detected. However, as for the surface condition of the epitaxial layers of the present invention to which a lattice mismatch of 1 x 10 ³ to 5 x 10 ³ at room temperature was introduced to alleviate a strain, the results of similar observation were favorable and showed a good specular surface. If Δa a exceeded 5 x 10 ³, the inherent adverse effect of lattice mismatch emerges instead of the effect of alleviating a strain. The lower limit of Δa a at which the effect of the present invention can be detected is 1 x 10 ³, and a deteriorated specular surface can be noted at a level lower than that. Furthermore, using wafers of these DH structures for LDs, Zn diffused planner stripe type LDs with a stripe width of 18 µm were fabricated, and a comparison was made of their oscillating threshold current density by pulse operation at room temperature. The selective Zn diffusion was performed through the window of SiO₂ layer so as to reach the P type clad layer. Ohmic contacts to the p side and the n side were made by An Zn layer and An Ge Ni layer, respectively. The LDs prepared from wafers of lattice matched DH structures for LDs were pulsed at a threshold current density of I As described above, it has been found that the aforementioned problems can be resolved if growth is effected by intentionally carrying out a lattice mismatch of approximately Δa a 1 x 10 ³ to 5 x 10 ³ with the constant composition layer. Preferably, Δa a is selected to be in the range of 3 x 10 ³ to 4 x 10 ³. The aforementioned value of lattice mismatch is very large as compared with the critical value of allowable lattice mismatch generally Δa a I 5 x 10 ⁴ or thereabout at which it is conventionally considered that an epitaxial layer without any misfit dislocation can be obtained in cases where a layer of InGaP or InGaAsP is epitaxially grown on a GaAs bulk crystal substrate. The fact that the epitaxial layer with such a great lattice mismatch yields a better specular surface than a lattice matched epitaxial layer is a remarkable phenomenon. The reason for this phenomenon can be surmised as follows It can be considered that a portion of a stress caused as a result of a difference in the lattice constant between a GaAs substrate and a GaAsP epitaxial growth layer is alleviated by misfit displacements or the like, while some other portion is stored in the GaAsP graded layer and GaAsP constant layer as a strain. It is considered that when epitaxial growth is effected on a substrate where such a strain is inherently present, a better epitaxial layer can be obtained if a lattice mismatch to the extent of alleviating the strain is incorporated into the epitaxial growth. With respect to the growth on a GaAsP graded substrate subjected to graded epitaxial growth using a GaP bulk single crystal in such a manner that the lattice constant will become larger, a favorable specular surface can be obtained for the aforementioned reason if an epitaxial layer having a small lattice constant of Δa a being 1 x 10 ³ to 5 x 10 ³ is grown. More specifically, DH structures for LDs were prepared for the following respective cases a case where lattice match is carried out on a substrate in which an InAs More specifically, as for the InAsP graded substrate, an approximately 300 µm thick InP bulk single crystal was used as the crystal 1. The graded layer is a grown layer in which a 30 µm thick mixed crystal composition layer is changed by small degrees from InAs A comparison was made between the case where the above described DH structures for LD In the case where lattice match was effected, the composition of each grown layer was InAs In the case of the present invention in which lattice mismatch was introduced so as to alleviate the strain, the composition was InAs However, the average oscillating threshold current density was I As described above, if the epitaxial technique of the present invention is used, it becomes possible to form epitaxial layers with good surface conditions and crystal qualities on graded substrates as compared with the conventional method. Needless to say, the present invention can be applied to any other known semiconductor device which are grown on a graded substrate.
