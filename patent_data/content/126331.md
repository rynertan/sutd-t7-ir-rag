# Data input module.

## Abstract
A data input module has a data card jack with power out contacts, power in contacts and data input contacts. The power out contacts are connected to a power source, which is protected against surges and alternating voltages in the module. The power in contacts are connected to power terminals of three integrated circuits and a fourth oscillator integrated circuit, which feeds clocking pulses to the three integrated circuits. The data contacts of the jack are con nected to input terminals of two of the integrated circuits. The power in contacts are additionally connected to inputs of the third integrated circuit. Power from the power source powers the input module elements through the power out and power in contacts and through a card interposed be tween the contacts to activate the circuit. At the same time, binary data from the signal contacts provides information to the first and second integrated circuits. The integrated cir cuits are pulsed to provide pulse sequences from the first integrated circuit to the second integrated circuit, from the second integrated circuit to the third integrated circuit and pulsed signal sequences from the third integrated circuit, which summarizes the simultaneous plural binary inputs from the jack into a pulsed output signal.
