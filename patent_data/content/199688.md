# Apparatus for measuring the oxygen uptake of a person.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the oxygen uptake of a person connected to a respirator 23 includes a closed container 1 of variable volume. The container 1 can be connected to the respiratory passages of the person, via an inspiration line 2 and an expiration line 3 , so that the person can inspire from and expire to the container 1 . One of the lines incorporates a carbon dioxide absorber 19 for removing carbon dioxide from the respiratory gas. Means 17, 18 are provided for monitoring the volume of the container 1 , and controllable means 8,9,10 are found for supplying pure oxygen gas to the container 1 . The oxygen gas supply means 8,9,10 are so controlled by the means 17,18 monitoring the volume of the bellows 1 that the volume of the bellows at a given predetermindd point in the breathing cycle of the person connected to the apparatus is held substantially unchanged. Means are also provided for determining the amount of oxygen gas supplied to the container 1 herewith. The interior of the container 1 is connected to the respirator 23 , via a line 11 incorporating closure means 12 , so that prior to the actual measuring process the person connected to the apparatus obtains assistance in breathing from the respirator via the interior of the container 4 and the volume of gas therein assumes a state of equilibrium with respect to temperature and relative humidity prior to commencing the measuring operation. The variable container 1 is enclosed in an outer, rigid vessel 13 , the interior of which communi cates with the respirator 23 , so as to provide requisite breathing assistance during the actual measuring process.
