Also, hydroxyamine or a hydrazide compound may be available as the preservative.Otherwise, it may freely be practiced to impart the function of controlling pH and buffering with a caustic alkali, a carbonate alkali or an amine as employed generally in black and white developer, and to add an inorganic development inhibiting agent such as potassium bromide, a metal ion capturing agent such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid, a development accelerator such as methanol, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, polyalkylene oxide, etc., a surfactant such as sodium alkyl aryl sulfonate, natural saponin, sugars or alkyl esters of the aforesaid compound, etc., film hardener such as glutaraldehyde, formalin, glyoxal, etc., or an ion strength controlling agent such as sodium sulfate, etc. The pH value may be adjusted as desired at 9 to 12, but the range from pH 10 to 11 is preferred in view of preservation characteristic and photographic performance.The developer according to this invention may also contain an organic solvent selected from alkanol amines or glycols, if desired.The above alkanol amines may be, for example, monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, triethanol amine. Preferably, triethanol amine is employed. These alkanol amines may be employed preferably in an amount of 20 to 500 g, particularly preferably 60 to 300 g, per liter of the developer. The above glycols may include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, 1,5 pentane diol and the like. Preferably, ethylene glycol is employed. These glycols may be employed preferably in an amount of 20 to 500 g, particularly 60 to 300 g, per liter of the developer.The above alkanolamines and glycols may be used either singly or as a combination of two or more compounds.In the method for processing of the direct posi light sensitive photographic material of this invention, processing may be conducted according to various conditions. The processing temperature, for example, the developing temperature may preferably 50 C or lower, particularly preferably around 30 Or while developing may generally be completed within 3 minutes, particularly preferably within 2 minutes to give frequently favorable results. The processing steps other than development, for example, washing, stopping, stabilizing and fixing, and further the steps of prehardening, neutralization, etc., if desired, may be freely employed, and these steps can also be omitted depending on the occasion.Further, these processings may be either the so called manual developing processing such as tray developing or frame developing or mechanical developing such as roller developing or hanger developing.The light sensitive material of this invention and its preferred processing method as described in detail above can accomplish completely the objects of this invention.For example, when the printing evaluation onto a printing plate was performed by use of the thus obtained lightsensitive silver halide photographic material for photoengraving, a printing plate having dot quality with lowDmin minimum density and excellent sharpness in its finishing was found to be prepared.

Example 3An emulsion was prepared following the same procedure as in Example 1, but without addition of rhodium chloride, and subjected to ripening to form fog. This emulsion was divided into 5 equal portions, and coating solutions were prepared according to the recipes E1 through E5. However, into each solution was added pinakryptol yellow in methanolic solution in an amount of 1 g per mole of the silver halide. Subsequently, following the same steps of Example 1, exposure and processing were conducted. Evaluation of the image obtained gave the result that the samples employing the emulsions containing tetrazolium compounds according to this invention are inhibited in re reversal, and finishing with low Dmin and excellent sharpness could be obtained.By the light sensitive photographic material of this invention, the above objects of this invention can be accomplished, whereby Dmin of dot and sharpness of the dot can be improved. And, further, the above effects can be still promoted by processing with a developer containing a compound represented by the aforementioned formula 11.
