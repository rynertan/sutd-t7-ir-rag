# Switching power supply.

## Abstract
A switching power supply 10 in which the maximum power output is limited during various line voltages within a predetermined range on a cycle by cycle basis. The power supply 10 comprises a transformer 15 in which an alternating current voltage is applied across the primary winding 15a thereof. Switching means 25 are connected in series with the primary winding 15a . The repetitive conduction and non conduction of the switching means 25 controls the flow of current in the secondary winding circuit 30 of the transformer 15 for producing a direct current output voltage in the secondary winding circuit 30 . Output voltage is produced in the secondary winding circuit 30 during the interval the switching means 25 is not conducting. For limiting the maximum power output in the secondary winding circuit 30 during various line voltages, a control circuit 40 controls the maximum conduction time of the switching means 25 in response to the rectified voltage appearing across the primary winding 15a of the transformer 15 . The conduction time of the switching means 25 under the control of the control circuit 40 is commensurate with the time it takes the current flowing through the primary winding 15a of the transformer 15 to reach a predetermined magnitude and is commensurate with the magnitude of the voltage across the primary winding 15a of the transformer 15 varying from a preselected magnitude. Thus, the output power produced in the secondary winding circuit 30 has a predetermined maximum value although there is a variance from the preselected limits for the line voltage.
