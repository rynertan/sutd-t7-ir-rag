# Method of mounting galvanometer mirror.

## Abstract
A metal mount 3a of a galvanometer mirror 3 is secured to a plate 1 made of an electrically conductive material via a thin insulating layer 2 in electrically insulated relation to the plate. The thin insulating layer 2 has a thickness within the range of about 10µm to about 500µm. The metal mount 3a and the thin insulating layer 2 are cylindrical and are secured to a cylindrical through hole 1a formed in the plate 1 . Or, the metal mount 15 has an L shaped cross section. One section of the L shaped metal mount 15 is secured to the plate 11 by use of bolts 16 , and the other section thereof is secured to the galvanomen ter mirror by use of screws 14 . In this case, an isulation sheet 12 is positioned between the one section of the L shaped metal mount 15 and the plate 11 .
