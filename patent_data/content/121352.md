## Description
LEADER SEQEEN TO EROMOEg TES SECRETION OF GENE PRODUCTS The present invention relates to fragments of specific deoxyribonucleotide sequences that promote the secretion of gene products from cells and in particular to recombinant INA transfer vectors that contain these fragments. Recent developments in biochemistry have led to the construction of recombinant DNA transfer vectors in which, transfer vectors, for example plasmids, are made to contain exogeneous DNA. In some cases the recombinant incorporates heterologous DNA that codes for polypeptides that are ordinarily not produced by the organism susceptible to transformation by the recombinant vehicle. In its basic outline a method of endowing a micro organism with the ability to synthesise a new protein involves three2, general steps a isolation and purification of the specific gene or nucleò tide sequences containing the genetically coded information for the amino acid sequence of the desired protein or polypeptide, b recombination of the isolated gene or nucleotide sequence with an appropriate transfer vector, typically DNA of a bacteriophage or plasmid to form a recombinant transfer vector that codes, in part, for the production of the desired protein or polypeptide, c transfer of the vector to the appropriate micro organism and selection of a strain of the recipient micro organism contnt ing the desired genetic information. Provided the gene or nucleotide sequence expresses its protein or polypeptide in the chosen micro organism, growth of the micro organism should then produce the desired protein or polypeptide in significant quantities. Once the micro organism has been cultured, the protein or polypeptide must be isolated from the undesired materials. This step is considerably facilitated if the majority of the desired protein or polypeptide is present in the culture medium and or the periplasmic space of the micro organism. In other words purification may be performed in a more efficient manner if, once expressed, the protein or polypeptide passes through the cell membrane and out of the cytoplasm. The passage of the protein or polypeptide through the cell membrane is desirable for two main reasons. First the desired protein or polypeptide will generally be foreign to the micro organism in which it is expressed. In many cases, therefore, it will be quickly broken down by proteolytic enzymes etc in the cells cytoplasm and will, subsequently, have a short half life within the cell. By transferring the protein or polypeptide out of the cytoplasm soon after expression the stability of the protein or polypeptide will be greatly increased. Second the number of unwanted genetic materials and products from which the desired protein or polypeptide must be isolated will be far greater in the cell s cytoplasm than in the culture medium and or in the cell s periplasmic space.It can be seen that on both of the above counts the transfer of the protein or polypeptide through the cell membrane and out of the cytoplasm will greatly facilitate protein or polypeptide isolation. One way in which the secretion of gene products from the cells cytoplasm may be promoted is to produce, within the cytoplasm, a preprotein or prepolypeptide in which the desired protein or polypeptide is preceded by a signal polypeptide. The predominantly hydrophobic signal polypeptide directs the desired protein or polypeptide to the cell 5 periplasmic space, where the signal peptide is removed as the desired protein or polypeptide traverses the cell membrane. Many of the known signal peptides contain cysteine residues.These residues have been found to react in the cell nembrane and thereby inhibit the efficient transfer of the desired gene product out of the cell. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide recombinant DNA transfer vectors containing a leader sequence polynucleotide that codes for a signal peptide that is cysteine free.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description thereof. According to the present invention there is provided a recombinant DNA transfer vector comprising a leader sequence polynucleotide coding for signal polypeptide of formula I. Met Arg Pro Ser lle His Arg Thr Ala lle Ala Ala Val Leu Ala Thr Ala Phe Val Ala Gly Thr The transfer vector may be a bacteriophage or, which is preferred, a plasmid. Preferably the majority of the codons in the nucleotide sequence are those preferred for the expression of microbial genomes. Suitable codons are listed in UK 1,568,047 and BE 2007675L, and these publications are therefore incorporated herein by reference. In one preferred embodiment of the present transfer vector the nucleotide sequence has formula II 5 ATG OGO CCA TCC BTC CAC CGC ACA GCC ATC GCC GCC GTG CTG GCC ACC II GCC TTC GTG GCG GGC ACC 3 The nucleotide sequence coding for the signal polypeptide the leader sequence poly nucleotide will preferably be downstream of and in reading phase with a bacterial or a yeast promoter and a prokaryotic ribosome binding site in the transfer vector. Moreover the leader sequence polynucleotide will either be upstream of an insertion site for a structural gene or, which is preferred, will be upstream of and in reading phase with a structural gene coding for a desired protein or polypeptide.Preferably the gene codes for a eukaryotic, particularly a mammalian, protein 9r polypeptide. The structural gene may code, for example, for such eukaryotic proteins as human growth hormone, human insulin or human chorionic somatomammotropin. Alternatively it may code for such prokaryotic proteins as E. coli ss galactosidase or Pseudomonas carboxy peptidase G2 CPG Carboxypeptidase G2 is an enzyme, produced by Pseudomonas species strain ES 16, that has application in cancer chemotherapy.It is a Zn2 containing diner of 2 x 42,000 daltons and has high affinities Km values of 10 5 or 10 6M for both 5 methyltetrahydrofolate, the predominant ciculatory form of folate in mammals and for the folic acid antagonist methotrexate MTX , which is widely used in cancer chemotherapy. The enzyme may be used directly for the plasma depletion of reduced folates, essential as co factors in purine and particularly in pyrimidine biosynthesis. CPG2 has been shown to inhibit the development of the Walker 256 carcinoma in vivo and to remove MTX from circulation in patients where prolonged exposure to high doses of MTX leads to toxcity . Examples of transfer vectors according to the present invention that code for CPG2 are pNM1, pNM111, pNM14, pNM21, pNM22, pNM31, pNM32 and pLEC3. The promoter is preferably a high expression bacterial or yeast promoter for the structural gene in variety of hosts. The particular choice of promoter will depend on the microorganism to be transformed.For example the transforsation of E.coli will generally be effected by a transfer vector in which an E.coli promoter controls the expression of the structural gene. Examples of E.coli promoters are those present in the plasmids pBR 322 and PAT 153. By contrast, the transformation of Pseudomonas species will generally be effected by a transfer vector in which a Pseudomonas promoter controls the expression of the structural gene. Examples of Pseudomonas promoters are those present in the plasmid pKT 230 or Pseudomonas chromosomal DNA. In order to express the structural gene the present transfer vector will be transformed into a suitable microorganism. According to a further aspect of the present invention thereforethere is provided a microorganism transformed by a recombinant DNA transfer vector according to this invention. The microorganism will preferably be 2 bacterium or yeast in which high expression of the structural gene, within the transfer vector, occurs. Depending on the choice of promoter the microorganism may be a strain chosen from one of the following bacteria E.coli, Pseudomonas and Bacillus or the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Raving transformed the microorganism, the protein or polypeptide, for which the structural gene codes, may then be expressed by culturing the transformed microorganism in a culture medium. It is the primary advantage of the present invention that culturing the transformed microorganism affords a preprotein or prepolypeptide in which the desired protein or polypeptide is preceded by the present signal polypeptide. This means that soon after expression the signal polypeptide directs the desired protein or polypeptide to the cell s periplasmic space, where the signal polypeptide is removed as the desired protein or polypeptide traverses the cell membrance. Since the present signal polypeptide is free of cysteine residues the desired gene product will be efficiently secreted through the membrane. The present transfer vectors may be prepared by any of the methods that are well known in the recombinant DNA art. For example the leader sequence poly nucleotide may be synthesised by the modified triester method of K.Itakura etal, JACS, 1975, 97, 7327 or by the improved oligodeoxynucleotide preparation described in UK 2007675A.The disclosure of both of these references is incorporated herein by reference. The synthesised polynucleotide may then be inserted in a transfer vector, preferably a plasmid. In the transfer vector it will preferably be downstream of and in reading phase with abacterial or a yeast promoter and a prokaryotic ribosome binding site. The leader sequence polynucleotide should also be either upstream of a structural gene insertion site or upstream of and in reading phase with a structural gene. Alternatively, DNA fragments containing the leader sequence polynucleotide may be obtained from natural sources, in particular from the chromosomal DNA of Pseudomonas species strain ES 16. In this particular case a polynucleotide formula II above coding for the present signal polypeptide immediately precedes a structural gene coding for CPG2. A number of the DNA fragments containing this leader sequence polynucleotide may therefore be recognised by their ability, on insertion into a plasmid and transformation of a microorganism by the resultant recombinant vector, to enable a microorganism to grow on folate.Examples of such recombinant transfer vectors that contain both a polynucleotide coding for the present signal polypeptideformula II above and a structual gene coding for CPG2 are pNM1, pNM111, pNM14, pNM21, pNN22, pEM51, pNM32 ani pIC3. Of cantse, alice a Fol recombinant vector has been obtained in this way it may be subcloned to afford alternative vectors either Fol or Fol that also contain a polynucleotide coding for the present signal polypeptide. Once a suitable DNA fragment has been isolated it may then be inserted in a transfer vector, preferably a plasmid. In the transfer vector the leader sequence polynucleotide on the inserted fragment should be downstream of and in reading phase with a bacterial or a yeast promoter and a prokaryotic ribosome binding site. The leader sequence polynucleotide should also be either upstream of a structural gene insertion site or upstream of and in reading phase with a structural gene. The structural gene for insertion downstream of and in reading phase with the present leader sequence polynucleotide may be obtained, for example, by the synthetic methods mentioned above this is particularly useful for the preparation of genes coding for small proteins, such as human growth hormone, insulin and human chorionic somatomammotropin. Alternatively the structural gene may be prepared from m IiNA by the use of the enzyme reverse transcriptase or may be isolated from natural sources chromosomal DNA . An example of the latter method is the isolation of DEA fragments containing a polynucleotide sequence shown in Table 1 coding for the enzyme CPG2 amino acid sequence also shown in Table 1 fromPseudomonas species strain RS 16 chromosomal DNA. Examples of plasmids containing a CPS2 structural gene, as well as a polynucleotide coding for the present signal polypeptide formula II above , are pNM1, pNM111, pNM14, pNM21, pNM22, pNM31, pNM32 and pLEC3. Once prepared or isolated the leader sequence polynucleotide and the structural gene will be inserted into a transfer vector, preferably a plasmid, to form a recombinant DNA transfer vector according to the present invention. The insertion step or steps will preferably be effected by one of the well known techniques in this art that employ restriction endonucleases, see for example the methods discussed in UK 2090600A1 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The choice of transfer vector will be determined by the microorganism in which the leader sequence polynucleotide and structural gene are to be expressed.Generally the transfer vector will be a cloning vehicle that is suitable for transforming the chosen micro organisms and that displays a phenotypical characteristic, such as antibiotic resistance, by which the recombinant transfer vectors may be selected.Thus, if the micro organism is to be E coli, then suitable transfer vectors will be the i coli plasmids pBR322 and pAT153. alternatively, if the micro organism is to be Pseudomonas, TABLE 1A Polynucleotide Sequence, coding for CPG2, isolated fromPseudomonas species strain RS 16 chromosomal DNA Net Arg Pro Ser lie is Arg Thr 5 ATG CGC CCA TCC ATC CAC CGC ACA 10Ala lie Ala Ala Val Leu Ala Thr AlaGCC ATC GCC GCC GTG CTG GCC ACC GCC 20Phe Val Ala Gly Thr Ala Leu Ala GlnTTC GTG GCG GGC ACC GCC CTG GCC CAG 30Lys Arg Asp Asn Yal Leu Phe Gln AlaAAG CGC GAC AAC GTG CTG TTC CAG GCA 40Ala Thr Asp Glu Gln Pro Ala Val lieGCT ACC GAC GAG CAG CCG GCC GTG ATC 50Lys Thr Leu Glu Lys Leu Val Asn lieAAG ACG CTG GAG AAG CTG GTC AAC ATC 60Glu Thr Gly Thr Gly Asp Ala Glu GlyGAG ACC GGC ACC GGT GAC GCC GAG GGC 70 lie Ala Ala Ala Gly Asn Phe Leu GluATC GCC CCT GCG GGC AAC TTC CTC GAG 80Ala Glu Leu Lys Asn Leu Gly Phe ThrGCC GAG CTC AAG AAG CTC GGC TTC ACGVal Thr Arg Ser Lys Ser Ala Gly LeuGTC ACG CGA AGC AAG TCG GCC GGC CTG 90Val Val Gly Asp Asn lie Val Gly LysGTG GTG GGC GAC AAC ATC GTG GGC AAG 100 lie Lys Gly Arg Gly Gly Lys Asn LeuATC AAG GGC CGC GC GC AAG AAC CTG 110Leu Leu Met Ser His Met Asp Thr ValCTG CTG ATG TCG CAC ATG GAC ACC GTC 120Tyr Leu Lys Gly lie Leu Ala Lys AlaTAC CTG AAG GGC ATT CTC GCG AAG GCC 130Pro Phe Arg Val Glu Gly Asp Lys AlaCCG TTC CGC GTC GAA GGC GAC AAG GCC 140Tyr Gly Pro Gly lie Ala Asp Asp LysTAC GGC CCG GGC ATC GCC GAC GAC AAG 150Gly Gly Asn Ala Val lle Leu His ThrGGC GGC AAC GCG GTC ATC CTG CAC ACG 160Leu Lys Leu Leu Lys Glu Tyr Gly ValCTC AAG CTG CTG AAG GAA TAC GGC GTG 170Arg Asp Tyr Gly Thr lie Thr Val LeuCGC GAC TAC GGC ACC ATC ACC GTG CTGPhe Asn Thr Asp Glu Glu Lys Gly SerTTC AAC ACC GAC GAG GAA AAG GGT TCC 180Phe Gly Ser Arg Asp Leu lie Gin GluTTC GGC TCG CGC GAC CTG ATC CAG GAA 190Glu Ala Lys Leu Ala Asp Tyr Val LeuGAA GCC AAG CTG GCC GAC TAC GTG CTC 200Ser Phe Glu Pro Thr Ser Ala Gly AspTCC TTC GAG CCC ACC AGC GCA GGC GAC 210Glu Lys Leu Ser lieu Gly Thr Ser GlyGAA AAA CTC TCG CTG GGC ACC TCG GGC 220 lie Ala Tyr Val Gln Val Asn lie ThrATC GCC TAC GTG CAG GTC AAC ATC ACC 230Gly Lys Ala Ser His Ala Gly Ala AlaGGC AAG GCC TCG CAT GCO GGC GCC GGG 240Pro Glu Leu Gly Val Asn Ala Leu ValCCC GAG CTG CCC GTG AAC GCG CTG GTC 250Glu Ala Ser Asp lieu Val lieu Arg ThrGAG GCT TCC GAC CC GTG CTG CGC ACG 260Met Asn lie Asp Asp Lys Ala Lys AsnATG AAC ATC GAC GAC AAG GCG AAG AACLeu Arg Phe Asn Trp Thr lie Ala LysCTG CGC TTC AAC TGG ACC ATC GCC AAG 270Ala Gly Asn Val Ser Asn lie lie ProGCC GGC AAC GTC TCG AAC ATC ATC CCC 280Ala Ser Ala Thr Leu Asn Ala Asp ValGCC AGC GCC ACG CTG AAC GCG GAC GTG 290 Tyr Tyr Ala Arg Asn Glu Asp Phe AspCGC TAC GCG CGC AAC GAG GAC TTC GAC 300Ala Ala Met Lys Thr Leu Glu Glu ArgGCC GCC ATG AAG ACG CTG GAA GAG CGG 310Ala Gln Gln Lys Lys Leu Pro Glu AlaGCG CAG CAG AAG AAG CTG CCC GAG GCC 320Asp Val Lys Val lie Val Thr Arg GlyGAC GTG AAG GTG ATC GTC ACG CGC GGC 330Arg Pro Ala Phe Asn Ala Gly Glu GlyCGC CGG GCC TTC AAT GCC GGC GAA GGC 340Gly Lys Lys Leu Val Asp Lys Ala ValGGC AAG AAG CTG GTC GAC AAG GCG GTG 350Ala Tyr Tyr Lys Glu Ala Gly Gly ThrGCG TAC TAC AAG GAA GCC GGC GGC ACGLeu Gly Val Glu Glu Arg Thr Gly GlyCTG GGC GTG GAA GAG CGC ACC GGC GGC 360 Gly Thr Asp Ala Ala Tyr Ala Ala LeuGGC ACC GAC CCG GCC TAC GCC GCG CTC 370Ser Gly Lys Pro Val lie Glu Ser LeuTCA GGC AAG CCA GTG ATC GAG AGC CTG 380Gly Leu Pro Gly Phe Gly Tyr His SerGGC CTG CCG GGC TTC GGC TAC CAC AGC 390Asp Lys Ala Glu Tyr Yal Asp lie SerGAC AAG GCC GAG TAC GTG GAC ATC AGC 400Ala lie Pro Arg Arg Leu Tyr Met AlaGCG ATT CCG CGC CGC CTC TAC ATG GCT 410Ala Arg Leu lie Met Asp Leu Gly AlaCGC CGC CTG ATC ATG GAT CTG GGC GCCGly LysGGC AAG TGA 3 Amino acids 1 to 22 are the present signal polypeptideAmino acids 23 to 415 are the CPG2 structural gene NB The leader sequence polynucleotide is the preferred polynucleotide of formula II. then a suitable transfer vector will be Pseudomonas pkT230.

Example 1Preparation of recombinant plasmid pNMl A plasmid containing both the present leader sequence polynucleotide and the CPG2 structural gene To isolate the gene for carboxypeptidase G2 together with the leader sequence polynucleotide chromosomal DNA prepared from thePseudomonas host strain RS 16 was partially digested with Sau3A and fragments of between 6 8 Md isolated from agarose gels by electroelution. The sized DNA was ligated with alkaline phosphatase treated Bamil cut pBR322, transformed into E.coli W5445, andApr transformants selected.Of the 3,500 Apr colonies obtained, approximately 70 were TO5. Utilisation of a rapid plasmid isolation technique on 50 Ap TCs transformants demonstrated that 90 of the gene bank harboured plasmids of the expected size. As a further check on the authenticity of the gene bank, the individual clones were screened for the acquisition of a Leu phenotype. Two such clones were identified. Both carried a plasmid capable of transforming leuB B isopropylmalate dehydrogenase E.coli mutants to prototrophy. Acquisition of a functional CPG2 gene should enable E.coli to utilise folic acid as a carbon source. The 2,400 gene bank clones were screened for the ability to grow on minimal medium containing folate as the sole source of carbon ie Fol . A single Fol clone was detected and shown to harbour a plasmid capable of transforming plasmid minus W5445 to the Fol phenotype.Classical restriction mapping of this plasmid pNMl was undertaken which revealed the presence of a 5.9 Md insert of pseudom onad DNA within pBR322. The restriction enzyme clearage site map of pNMl is given in Figure 1. The nucleotide sequence of the leader sequence polynucleotide and the CPG2 structural gene is given in Table 1.Example 2Subcloning of plasmid pNNl to form pNMlll In order to pinpoint the position of the CPG2 gene and the leader sequence polynucleotide within the 5.9 Nd insert, subcloning of various restriction enzyme fragments, into pBR322, was undertaken. A functional CPG2 gene was shown not to occur on Xhol or Sphl fragments of tne pNM1 insert, but was present on a 3.1 Md Bg111 fragment. This latter fragment was cloned into theBamHl site of p3R322 to give pNM11 6.0 Md . A further reduction in the size of pNMll was achieved by digesting with Sall and religating the resultant fragment to yield pNM111.In addition, plasmids in which the smaller 0.95 Md Sall fragment had become inserted in the opposite orientation to the parent plasmid pNM11 were Cold. Taken together these subcloning results indicate that the OFG2 gene and the leader sequence polynucleotide lie between the Bglll site at 4.14 and the SAll site at 6.03 on pNM11.Furthermore, the gene contains a Sphl 5.17 t Sall 5.07 and at least one Xhol 4.56 and or 5.56 site. The restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pNM111 is given in Figure 2.Example 3Preparation of recombinant plasmid pNM14. A plasmid containing both the present leader sequence polynucleotide and the CPG2 structural gene The 3.1 Md Bgl II fragment from Example 2 above was partially digested with Sau3A. These fragments were then cloned into the Bam HI site of pAT153 and transformed into E coli W5445. Of the two Apr Tcs Fol colonies obtained, one contained a plasmid which had acquired an extra Sal I and Bam RI site, this was pNM 14.The restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pNM 14 is given inFigure 3. Sequencing of the leader sequence polynucleotide and the CPG2 structural gene present in pNM 14 gave the nucleotide structure shown in Table 1. DNA sequencing of pNM 14 also revealed that the Sal I Bam HI fragment was a duplication of a segment ofDNA from within the insert marked on Figure 3 composed of two contiguous Sau 3A fragments. Example 4 and 5Preparation of recombinant plasmids pNM 21 and pNM 22 Plasmids containing both the present leader sequence polynucleotide and the CPG2 structural gene The 3.1 Md Bgl II fragment from Example 2 was cloned into the Bam HI site of pAT 153 and transformed into E coli W 5445. Two Apr Tcs FoI colonies were obtained, one containing a plasmid pNM 21 in which the fragment was inserted in the opposite orientation to pNM1 and one containing a plasmid pNM22 in which the fragment was inserted in the same orientation as pNm1. The restriction enzyme cleavage site maps of pNM21 and pNM22 are given inFigures 4 and 5 respectively. The two plasmids, pNM21 and pNM22 both transformed E.coli to Fol , indicating that a pseudomonad promoter was present on the 3.1Md fragment. However, cells carrying the plasmid pNM21, in which the Bg111 fragment was cloned in the opposite orientation to peel, exhibited more rapid growth with folic acid as the sole carbon source. This difference was clearly visible on agar medium, where colonies developed concentric yellow halos of precipitated pteroic acid, the insoluble product of folate hydrolysis. Confirmation that pNM21 gave enhanced expression of CPG2 over pNM22, was obtained by assaying enzyme production during batch growth of cells containing either plasmid. The cells were grown in complex medium supplemented with 1 w v glucose and where appropriate 0.0 t w v folic acid. The generation time was 56 66 min. The culture was sampled at hourly intervals and whole cells were disrupted by sonication. Enzyme activity was determined in the centrifugal extract . Results are given inTable 2. The expression of CPG2 from the plasmids pNM22 and pEM1 was 2.5 units litre of culture, representing 0.005 soluble protein.In contrast, expression from pNM21 was 3000 3500 units litre of culture, which represented 4.gS soluble protein. As the cloned gene is inserted into the 13amHI site of pAT153, the observed higher expression of pNM21 is almost certainly due to transcriptional read through from the Tc promoter. The low expression ofCPG2 carried on plasmids pNMI and pNM22 is consistent with the view that Pseudomonas promoters function poorly in E.coli. It is also apparent from Table 2 that in the presence of folate there is a two fold increase in the specific activity of enzyme measured in cell sonicates.This phenomenon has been observed in all experiments, but does not seem to be associated with classical induction of the CPG2 gene, as overall enzyme yield in the presence or absence of folate remains at about 3000 litre culture. It in fact reflects a consistent depression in the soluble protein levels measured in sonicates from cells grown in the presence of folate. There is no obvious difference in growth rate of cells grown with folate and the reasons for this result are not clear.TABLE 2 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE G PRODUCTION BY E COLI W5445 , CONTAINING THE PLASMIDS pNM1, pNM21 and pNM22.CULTURE CARBOXYPEPTIDASE G2 SPECIFIC ACTIVITY U MG SOLUBLE PROTEIN AGE pNM1 pNM22 pNM21 HR FOL FOL FOL FOL FOL FOL 1 11.5 13.4 2 12.9 9.6 3 .008 .005 .010 .019 13.9 23.3 4 .009 .011 .015 .013 12.3 26.9 5 .007 .019 .016 .016 11.5 25.6 6 .005 .024 ,014 .023 13.7 24.1 7 .015 .029 .024 .043 13.2 20.6 8 .013 .028 .024 .046 13.0 23.6Expression of the cloned gene in Pa.putida The observation that the CPG2 gene was expressed in E.coli regardless of the orientation of the gene within the vector suggested that the promoter region of the CPG2 gene had been cloned with the structural gene and the leader sequence polynucleotide.The low expression of CPG2 within E.coli from its natural promoter pNM1, pNM22, pNM111 confirmed other findings that Pseudomonas promoters are poorly recognised by E.coli RNA polymerases. It would be expected that if the gene was introduced back into a pseudomonad cellular environment, then improved expression from the Pseudomonas promoter should result. The 3.1 Md BgIII fragment was subcloned into the Pseudomonas cloning vector pKT230 at its single BamHI site. Two plasmids were obtained, pNM31 and pNM32 representing the two possible orientations of the cloned gene. These plasmids were transformed into Ps.putida 2440 by the method of Bagdasarian andTimmis. Pseudomonad cells carrying both plasmids were cultured in minimal salts medium and enzyme production monitored. Yields of 500 1000 units litre of culture were obtained regardless of gene orientation within the plasmid. Specific activity of the enzyme in cell sonicates was 1.5 to 4.0 U mg protein representing 0.3 to 0.7 soluble protein compared with 0.05f soluble protein in the donor strain RS 16 . This result strongly indicates that the CPG2 promoter is present and operating in a pseudomonad background. When the same plasmids were transformed into E.coliW5445 12 40 Units litre were found at specific activity 40.07 U mg C 0.01 soluble protein .Periplasmic localisation of CPG2 There is evidence that CPG2 is located in or near the periplasmic space of Pseudomonas strain RS 16. Pteroic acid, the product of CPG hydrolysis of folic acid is extremely insoluble 2 and is found predominantly outside the cell in both liquid and solid media. Exogeneous pteroic acid is also seen in E.coli cultures containing the cloned gene when folic acid is present in the medium.This is clearly demonstrated by the halo of precipitated pteroic acid observed around colonies carrying plasmids in which expression of CPG2 is from the Tc promoter of p3R322 eg pNM21 . The localisation of CP produced by E.coli cells carrying pNM21 was examined by the separation of cellular proteins into cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and whole membrane fractions. As a control, levels of three marker enzymes, alkaline phosphatase periplasmic glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase cytoplasmic and NADH.O2 oxidoreductase membrane bound , were also determined. As can be seen from Table 3 97 of the CPG2 activity occurs in the periplasm, equivalent to the marker periplasmic enzyme, alkaline phosphatase.This confirms the presence in pNM21 of a leader sequence polynucleotide next to the CPG2 gene that codes for a signal polypeptide according to this in vention that promotes the secretion of CP from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space. Carboxypeptidase G2 synthesised in E.coli The specific activity of CPG2 in crude cell extracts of cells carrying pNM21 was 50 fold higher than equivalent extracts fromPseudomonas strain BS 16. To determine whether the cloned gene product in E.coli had the same properties as CPG2 from the pseudomonad, enzyme was purified from E.coli carrying pNM21. The specific activity of purified CPG2 single band SDS PAGE was 535U mg of protein, which compares to 550 U mg of protein from the pseudomonad. CPG2 purified from E.coli clone pNM21 co chromatographed with CPG2 from Pseudomonas strain BS 16 at a sub unit molecular weight value of 42,000 daltons. Em vallues using methotrexate as substrate were 7.4 x 10 6M and 0 x 10 6M respectively.In addition, antiserum raised against the Pseudomonas enzyme indicated immunological identity between the E.coli and Pseudomonas c G2, as a confluent precipitation line was formed on Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis.

This Eco Ri fragment was then cloned into the promoter cloning vector E.coli pMC1403 M.J. Casadaban et al, J Bacteriol, 1980, 143, 971 , which carries only the structural gene lac Z for B galactosidase ie no promoter and no ATG start codon Steps B and C of Figure 6 .Plasmids were obtained in which the Eco RI fragment had inserted in both orientations, however, only those in which fusion of the CPG2 sequence to the B galactosidase sequence had occurred i yielded a 0.34 Kb fragment upon digestion with BamHI ii enabled the host cell to hydrolyse the colourless lactose analogue, BRIG, and impart a blue colouration to colonies. The 0.34 Kb BaiRI fragment has been recloned into M13mp7 and sequenced to confirm that fusion has occurred. The precursor fusion produced will consist of the signal peptide, the first 22 amino acids of CPG2, 6 amino acids derived from the M13mp7 and pMC1403linker units, and B galactosidase from its 8th amino acid onward. Localisation experiments have been performed on cells carrying a plasmid coding for the fusion gene where the cellular proteins have been fractionated into periplasmic, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. In these experiments an organism E,coli MC 1061 which is deleted for the lac Z gene was grown in phosphate medium E.C. Neu et al, J 3iol Chem, 1964, 240, 3685 and periplasmic enzymes were released from the harvested cells by conversion to spheroplasts.Separation of soluble proteins cytoplasmic from particulate proteins membrane band was achieved by soaiFating the harvested spheroplasts and subsequent centrifugation at 100,QOOg for 1hr, to sediment the cell membrane T.J.Silhary et al, Proc Natl AcadSci USA, 1976, 73, 3423 . The results given in Table 5 demonstrate the presence of 50 of the B galactosidase activity in the periplasmic space. This result is in direct contrast to similar work involving fusion of other periplasmic protein signal sequences to B galactosidase, where the fusion proteins are not exported, but become jammed in the membrane P.J.

Sherwood and R.K. Gibson, The Molecular Biology of Yeast, 1979, Cold Spring Harbor Publications to give plasmids pLEC3 and pIEC4 Figure 7 . These plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain LL20 by the lithium acetate induced transformation method described by Ito et al., J. Bact., 1983, 153, 163. Yields equivalent to 10 20 units litre of culture volume were obtained regardless of gene orientation within the plasmid.Specific activity of the enzyme in total cell extracts was 0,2 0.3u mg protein representing 0.005 soluble protein. This level of expression from the pseudomonad promotor in a yeast background is similar to the level found when the gene was reading from its own promotor in 2.coli 0.01 soluble probein . Localisation experiments have been performed on yeast cells carrying the above plasmids by sphaeroplasting the cells using standard techniques described by J.B.D. 3eggs, Nature, 1978, 275, 105. Periplastic enzymes, localised outside of the cell membrane, were released when the cell wall was removed. The osmotic stabiliser 1.2ç sorbitol was then replaced by 0.1M Tris HCl buffer, pR 7.3 containing 0.2mM ZnCl2 to lyse the sphaeroplasts and the whole centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour to separate proteins in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction from membrane bound proteins. The results in Table 6 demonstrate the presence of 64 of the CPG2 activity in the periplasmic fraction and a further 1 6o associated with the cell membrane fraction.
