# Amorphous alloys and filaments thereof.

## Abstract
Several iron base glassy alloys in the Fe Cr Mo B system have very high tensile strengths, ranging from about 550 to 700 Kpsi. These alloys consist essentially of about 56 to 68 atom percent iron, about 4 to 9 atom percent chromium, about 1 to 6 atom percent molybdenum and about 27 to 29 atom percent boron plus incidental impurities.
