# The preparation of metal alkyls.

## Abstract
A method of producing a trialkyl gallium compound R The organic radicals R₁ and R₂ may be aromatic and or aliphatic radicals. They are preferably alkyl or phenyl radicals. Preferably R₁R₂O is an ether having a boiling point more than 100 C above that of the trialkyl gallium compound. The radi cals R₁ and R₂ may each independently have from 1 to 14 carbon atoms but preferably together R₁ and R₂ have between seven and twelve carbon atoms inclusive. Desirably, R₁R₂O is di isopentyl ether 3,3 demethylpro pyl ether. Other examples of R₁R₂O are diphenyl ether and anisole methylphenyl ether . Preferably, Q is iodine and the gallium trihalide is a chloride.
