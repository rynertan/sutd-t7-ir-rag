Preferred because of their high antibacterial activity are those compounds where, independently,R5 is H and R1 NH2 or NH CH3. Specifically preferred for its high antibacterial activity is the compound L 4 5 hydroxymethyl 2 oxooxazolidin 3 yl benzenesultonamide.

Physiologically acceptable cations Z include alkali or alkaline earth metal ions such asK , Mg , Ca , Li and Na . Other suitable ions would be known to one skilled in the art Detailed Description of the InventionSynthesis Compounds of Formula I where R5 H and R1 NR2R3, or NtOR2 R3 represented by Formula Ia, can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1.Scheme 1 EMI4.1 where Y is an acyl group. The OH function of 5 hydroxymethyl 3 phenyl 2 oxazolidinone II is blocked by refluxing this compound with a reagent which will introduce an acyl group, preferably an alpha halogenated alkanoyl group. Suitable reagents for this purpose include trifluoroacetic anhydride, dichloroacetyl chloride, dichloroacetic anhydride, trichloroacetyl chloride, and trichloroacetic anhydride. The mixture is refluxed at a temperature in the range of about 0 to 150 cm, preferably 0 to 4O0C. This step may be done in the absence of solvent or with any inert hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent.The resulting ester III is contacted with either a halosulfonic acid such as chlorosulfonic acid or fluorosulfonic acid at a temperature of about 30 to 400C to yield the sulfonyl halide of Formula IV. This step also may be done in the absence of solvent or in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as CHCl3, CH3CC13 or CCl4. This product is then dissolved in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, ether, dioxane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or urea solvents, and contacted with the appropriate amine,HNR2R3, or HN OR2 RD, at a temperature in the range of about 200C to 30 C, to yield the compound ofFormula Ia. Compounds of Formula I where X OH and R1 N3, represented by Formula Ib, can be prepared by contacting the sulfonyl halide IV with sodium or potassium azide in an acetone water mixture, as illustrated inScheme 2. Suitable solvents include acetone, lower boiling ketone solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and cyclopentanone, ether solvents and dipolar aprotic solvents. Scheme 2 EMI6.1 The azides Ib as well as the hydrazides Ic of this invention can also be prepared according toScheme 3.Scheme 3 EMI6.2 The sulfonyl halide IV is contacted with hydrazine to prepare the hydrazide Ic. This can then be reacted with a nitrite such as sodium nitrite in dilute acid solution to yield the azide Ib. The azideIb can be reduced by any one of several known methods to yield the sulfonamide Ia. Suitable reduction methods include catalytic methods, reaction with sodium borohydride in an alcohol or in tetrahydrofuran or reaction with zinc and acetic acid. Compounds of the invention where R5 OH and R 1 NXZ, NX2 or N S O nR8R9 can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 4 Scheme 4 EMI7.1 The halosulfonamide Id can be readily prepared by contacting a sulfonamide Ia with halogen and a base such as sodium hydroxide or with a preformed hypohalite such as sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. To prepare the N,N dihalosulfonamide Ie, the pH is adjusted to the range of about 4 to 8. Methods of adjusting the pH include addition of acetic acid, carbon dioxide or dilute mineral acid. The sulfilimines If can be prepared by contacting the halosulfonamide Id with a dialkyl sulfide,SR8Rg such as dimethylsulfide, trimethylene sulfide, methylethyl sulfide or tetrahydrothiophene, preferably in a water alcohol solution. Oxidation of the sulfilimines with, for example, hypochlorite or meta chloroperbenzoic acid, yields the sulfoximines Ig. Compounds of the invention where R1 NR1OX can be prepared, as illustrated in Scheme 5, by reaction with a hypohalite.Scheme 5 EMI8.1 Various simple esters of this invention, represented by Formula Ii, can be prepared as shown inScheme 6 by reaction of a compound of Formula Ia Ih with the appropriate acid chloride or anhydride, preferably in the presence of a base such as pyridine or 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The preferred solvent is pyridine or other solvents of the pyridine class, although in many cases no solvent is required.Scheme 6 EMI9.1 Many of the simple esters can also be prepared by halosulfonating a compound of Formula V as illustrated in Scheme 7. No solvent is required, but solvents inert to the halosulfonic acid may be used. The product sulfonyl halide VI is then reacted with ammonia or an appropriate amine or an azide or hydrazine as inSchemes 1, 2, and 3 to yield the ester of Formula Ij. Scheme 7 EMI10.1 The starting material V can be prepared from 5 hydroxymethyl 3 phenyl 2 oxazolidinone as shown inScheme 8.Scheme 8EMI10.2 Other esters of this invention, Ik, can be prepared, as illustrated in Scheme 9, by contacting an alcohol with an appropriate anhydride Scheme 9 EMI11.1 where A CH CH ,EMI11.2 EMI11.3 and m is 2 or 3.Suitable solvents are weak bases of the pyridine class and a suitable temperature range for the reaction is about 30 to 1150C. The products obtained by the methods described above Ia Im are racemic mixtures, that is, 50 50 mixtures of and enantiomers. The synthesis of optically active compounds can be achieved by using as a starting material in Scheme 1 the compound t 5 hyd roxymethyl 3 phenyl 2 oxazolidinone IIa . This starting material can be obtained by the desulfurization of 3 4 methylthio phenyl 5 hydroxymethyl 2 oxazolidinone VII as shown in Scheme 10. Scheme 10 EMI12.1 A preferred process for preparing t 5 hydroxy methyl 3.phenyl 2 oxazolidinone IIa is illustrated in Scheme 11.Scheme 11 EMI12.2 Aniline in a 2 to 10 molar excess is reacted with glycidol. The excess aniline is removed by dis tillation, and the da 3 phenylamino l,3 propanediol is distilled under reduced pressure. It is resolved by combining it with about 50 60 mole percent t mandelic acid in chloroform or acetonitrile. The desired salt crystallizes and may be purified by recrystallization from chloroform or acetonitrile.The d 3 phenyl amino l,3 propanediol can be isolated by contacting it with a base. The salt is suspended in water, the pH of the mixture is brought to between 8 and 10, the mixture is then saturated with sodium chloride, and then is continuously extracted with dichloromethane. Alternatively, the salt is dissolved in a water alcohol mixture and passed over a strongly basic ion exchange resin. In either case, the resulting extract or column eluate is concentrated to leave the d 3 phenylamino l,3 propanediol. This product is then reacted with diethyl carbonate other carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate or diphenyl carbonate may be used in a polar solvent such as 1,2 dimethoxyethane using potassium carbonate and sodium methoxide as catalysts.The product is isolated by concentrating the solvent, diluting with water and a little acetic acid, and washing with water. The product may be purified by recrystallization from 95 ethanol or acetonitrile. By using d mandelic acid in this process, one can obtain the d isomer of 5 hydroxymethyl 3 phenyl 2 oxazolidinone. Another route to optically active compounds of the invention consists of carrying out the first reaction of Scheme 11 using optically active glycidol, preferably R glycidol, to provide the optically active base directly. The L 5 hydroxymethyl 3 phenyl 2 oxazolidinone IIa may also be prepared from R l benzylgly cerol S. Takano, E. Goto, M. Hirama, and Ogasawara, Heterocycles, 16, 381 1981 followed by tosylation with p toluene sulfonyl chloride in pyridine and reacting this S tosyl ester VIII with the potassium salt of N phenyl 4 methylbenzenesulfonamide in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF.The resulting product IX is reacted with sodium naphthalene radical anion to produce product X which is reacted with diethyl carbonate or other carbonate ester in the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium methoxide to produce the desired l isomer. This sequence is illustrated in Scheme 12 Scheme 12 EMI14.1 Amino acid esters of this invention R5 COCH NH2 R7 may be prepared by the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 13.Scheme 13 EMI15.1 An alcohol is contacted with the appropriate blocked amino acid XI in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. Suitable solvents include dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and ether, to which may be added a small amount of a weak base such as pyridine. Suitable temperatures are in the range of about 0 to 1000C.The filtered product X1I is treated with a volatile acid e.g., trifluoroacetic acid at 0 500C. Upon removal of the acid by, for example, vacuum distillation, the ester Im in the form of its acid salt e.g., trifluoroacetic acid salt remains. This may be freed as an amine by treatment with a base.Treatment of this amine with an appropriate acid yields desired salts such as hydrochloride, phosphate, sulfate, acetate and benzoate salts. The acidic compounds ilk of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic bases which salts are within the scope of this invention.Such salts include alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, ammonium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as the lower aliphatic amines, benzylamine, dicyclohexylamine, and salts with basic amino acids such as arginine.

They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents.They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its node and route of administration age, health, and weight of the recipient nature and extent of symptoms, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a daily dosage of active ingredient can be about 5 to 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily, when the more potent compounds of this invention are used, 5 to 15, and preferably 5 to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram per day, given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form, is effective to obtain desired results. These drugs may also be administered parenterally. Dosage forms compositions suitable for internal administration contain from about 1.0 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit.In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 95 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions, it can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose glucose , and related.sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfate, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid either alone or combined are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl or propyl paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, E. W. Martin, a standard reference text in this field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two piece hard gelatin capsules each with 75 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 150 milligrams of lactose, 24 milligrams of talc and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate. A mixture of active ingredient in soybean oil is prepared and injectd by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 75 milligrams of the active ingredient.The capsules are washed in petroleum ether and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit is 75 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams. of magnesium stearate, 250 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of cornstarch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5 by weight of active ingredient in 10 by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 milliliters contain 75 milligrams of finely divided active ingredient, 200 milligrams of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 milligrams of sodium benzoate, 1.0 grams of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 milliliters of vanillin.Utility Test results indicate that the novel compounds of this invention are active against a wide variety of aerobic, facultative anaerobic and obligate anaerobic bacterial isolates including beta lactamase producingStaphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoea strains, members of the gram negative Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial spectrum of these agents encompasses organisms recognized as major human and veterinary pathogens of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, genito urinary and central nervous systems blood interstitial fluids, soft tissue and bone.

The minimal inhibitory concentrations for the aerobic and facultative anaerobic test isolates representing two grampositive and eleven gram negative genera were determined by an agar dilution method. The method is state of the art and is as follows. Mueller Hinton agar plates are prepared containing two fold compound concentrations ranging from 128 vg ml to 1.0 g ml for the susceptibility testing of the bacterial strains except Neisseria gonorrhoea and Hemophilus sp.The latter organisms are tested using GC agar containing 1 Bacto Supplement C Difco Laboratories, Detroit,Michigan and are incubated under 6 CO2. The agar plates are inoculated with a 0.001 ml calibrated loopful of bacterial inoculum diluted to contain 5 x 106 colony forming units CFU per ml. After a 24 hour incubation period at 350C the MIC s are recorded as the lowest compound concentration which inhibits macroscopic bacterial growth. The agar dilution method described by A. L.Barry The Antimicrobic Susceptibility Test Principles and Practice , 1976, Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with compound concentrations of 32 vg ml to 0.06 vgZml, was used to determine the inhibitory activity of a 4 t5 hydroxymethyl 2 oxooxazo lidin 3 yl benzenesulfonamide for anaerobic bacteria.
