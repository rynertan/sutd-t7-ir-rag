## Abstract
A collimator exchanging system for exchange of col limators between an active device 14 and a storage device 8 includes a cart 5 which is provided with a catching locking device 26 for the collimator, the device 26 being constructed so that the collimator can be exchanged only in the correct orientation of the cart relative to the active device or the storage device. An unlocking pin 34 of the cart enables the exchange, the exchanging system otherwise being blocked.
