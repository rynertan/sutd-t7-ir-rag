## Abstract
Electrode material, preferably lithium metal, is protected by a layer of material ready to function as an electrode separator and capable of sufficient ionic conductivity to provide an electrolyte, preferably a solvent free polymeric electrolyte. The electrode material may be rolled to reduce its thickness while so protected.
