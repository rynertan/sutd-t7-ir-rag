# Pivot joint and window stay including such a pivot joint.

## Abstract
A pivot joint for pivotally coupling two components 10 and 11 where at least one of the components is movable relative to the other. A first component 11 is formed of a plastics material and has a projecting hollow spigot 12 the spigot being engaged within an opening 14 in the second component 10 . In order to effect the pivotal mounting of the first compo nent 11 with the second component 10 the free end of the spigot is deformed to have a diameter which is larger than the diameter of the opening 14 in the second component 10 . Deformation of the free end of the spigot 12 is preferably carried out by a headed fastening 13 being inserted into the bore of the hollow spigot.
