# Process for preparing a polymer alloy, molded product, and reaction injection molded product.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for preparing a polymer alloy based upon at least one polyamide polymer, and at least one polymer of the group of polyurethane polymer, polyurea polymer and polyisocyanurate polymer. The invention further relates to a molded object comprising a polyamide polymer, and at least one polymer of the group of polyurethane polymer, polyurea polymer and polyisocyanu rate polymer. The invention further comprises a reaction injection molded product composed of an alloy consisting of 1. at least one polymer of the group of a polyurethane polymer, polyurea polymer and polyisocyanurate polymer and 2. a polyamide polymer.
