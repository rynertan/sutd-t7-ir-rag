# Slant service rig.

## Abstract
A guide mat 102, 110 for a slant service or drill rig. The guide mat comprises rearward 110 and forward 100 portions and an open area 161 in the rearward portion which is used to allow access to a wellhead. Adjustable pedestals 119, 120 are provided which move in orthogonal planes to the plane of the guide mat and thereby allow for convenient pinning of the mast of the rig to the mat such that the mast is maintained in its correct operating position while the drilling and or service operations are underway.
