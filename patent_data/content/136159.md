## Description
BAKED PRODUCTS EXHIBITING STABLE PROPERTIES CHARACTERISTIC OF FRESHLY BAXED PRODUCTS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUCH PRODUCTSField of the Invention The present invention relates to bakeable flour based products, and particularly to a composite cookie dough bakeable to cookies which retain their freshly baked texture, flavor and appearance characteristics. The invention also relates to processes for preparing such bakeable products, and to processes for preparing baked confectionary products from the composite doughs of this invention. Background of the Invention In the past baked confectionary products have been prepared which are of the ready to serve variety, i.e., finished, fully baked products intended to be distributed and sold to consumers many days after preparation and packaging by the manufacturer. Ready to serve packaged cookies which closely mimic the organoleptic properties associated with freshly baked cookies are also known to the bakery arts. The difficulty in manufacturing ready to serve cookies which retain a degree of moistness, chewiness or softness characteristic of fresh, home baked cookies is known to be primarily a function of the dynamic loss of moisture from the baked cookie over time, typically a result of crystallization of the sugars e.g. sucrose present in cookie formulations. In recognition of this knowledge, the baking arts have provided a variety of methods aimed at retaining moisture and chewiness in cookie products by inhibiting the crystallization of sucrose present or employing sugars in the cookie formulation which have a lesser tendency to crystallize than sucrose.For example, it is known to manufacture ready to serve cookies wherein crystallizable sugars e.g. sucrose are replaced, either in whole or in part, with non crystallizable or slowly crystallizable sugars relative to sucrose under the same conditions. Such sugars include fructose, invert sugar a mixture of fructrose and dextrose , honey and the like which function to retain moisture in baked doughs or batters and, if crystallizable sugars such as sucrose remain present in the formulation, to inhibit the crystallization of such sugars. It is also known simply to add to conventional cookie formulations, materials other than sugars which also act as moisture retainers and crystallization inhibitors. One means of providing ready to serve cookies with the desired textural crisp moist combination characteristic of fresh, home baked cookies is to prepare cookies which contain distinct, texturally differing regions. One region may contribute a crisp texture, while a second region contributes a soft, moist or chewy texture. One example of that approach is found in U.S.Patent No. 3,026,205 to Irwin M. Stone wherein a first conventional layer of sucrose containing dough is overlaid with a second layer of sucrose containing conventional dough which contains sufficient alpha amylase to generate in this second layer products which are crystallization resistant, bind water and interact with sucrose to inhibit its crystallization, and to cause the sucrose to thereby also retain its water binding capacity. The first sucrose containing dough layer which is enzyme free, on the other hand, bakes to a crisp texture. Another example of cookie preparations following the approach described above is found in published European PatentApplication No. 0031718 published July 8, 1981 application number 80304703.4 . According to that application, two doughs are prepared, one dough containing conventional cookie ingredients including crystallizable sugars sucrose and the other dough containing conventional cookie ingredients with crystallization resistant sugars e.g., fructose, maltose, dextrose . Lamination of the doughs and baking provides a cookie having discrete regions of chewy texture attributable to the portion containing crystallization resistant sugars and discrete regions of crisp texture attributable to the portion containing crystallizable sugars . Another means which has been proposed for the production of baked products, such as cookies, which exhibit a stable textural crisp moist combination characteristic of freshly baked cookies, is the in situ development, in a single dough, of distinct dough regions which result, upon baking, in the production of a product having both crispy and chewy, moist textural regions. An example of such an approach is found in U.S. PatentNo. 2,801,921 to William Moses, wherein conventional sucrosecontaining dry brownie or cookie mix formulations are augmented with the addition of invertase enzyme. With the addition of water to the dry mix to form a batter or dough which is then baked in appropriate form, the invertase effects inversion of the sucrose to invert sugar. The presence of the invert sugar so generated inhibits crystallization of the sucrose. This effect is localized, however, in the center of the cookie or brownie as a result of the inherent nature of the baking process, i.e., the higher temperatures achieved in the outer portions of the cookie dough during baking inactivate the enzyme and retard or prevent its inversion to sucrdse in these portions.The inner portions of the cookie dough, owing to their insulation from direct heat and the considerable moisture therein, do not reach temperatures high enough to cause enzyme inactivation. The resultant product consists of a moist, chewy inner region surrounded by regions which are dry or crisp as a result of the unaffected sucrose crystallized in such regions. Similar processes are described in the earlier mentioned U.S. Patent No. 3,026,205 to Irwin M. Stone and U.S. PatentNo. 4,344,969 to Rudolph W. Youngquist et al. In the Stone patent, doughs or batters are formulated which contain flour, sugar, shortening, water and the enzyme alpha amylase. During baking, the alpha amylase becomes quickly inactivated in the regions of the dough or batter which are either directly exposed to the oven heat or in contact with a conductive surface e.g., a baking sheet or pan . In such regions, therefore, during normal baking the development of a dry, crisp crumb structure occurs.The internal portion of the dough does not, however, reach temperatures at which alpha amylase becomes inactive. In these internal portions, therefore, the alpha amylase is free to act upon the starches in the dough to produce therefrom dextrins and mono and disaccharides which are non crystallizable or only slowly crystallizable ,and which inhibit the crystallization of normally crystallizable sugars e.g., sucrose . The resultant product contains soft, moist regions and dry crisp regions. In the Youngquist et al. patent, enzymes such as invertase or amylases are employed to provide baked, ready to serve cookies with soft, moist chewy regions, with steps taken to inhibit enzyme activity in other regions so as to permit normal development of crystallized dry, crisp regions. Although the foregoing procedures provide potentially technologically acceptable routes to the provision of cookies and other baked products which exhibit a combined crispy chewy texture long after their actual preparation, difficulties exist in adapting these procedures to high speed, high volume commercial manufacturing techniques and in achieving the desired results in a cost effective manner. More specifically, processes involving enzyme utilization in a single dough to develop regions of moist, soft, chewy texture while retaining regions of crisp texture,require a degree of control as to enzyme handling, baking conditions and the like which can be somewhat difficult to achieve in a largescale environment. On the other hand, processes which require utilization of separate dough layers which are formulated ab initial to be bakeable to regions having crispy texture and regions having a chewy texture require the preparation and handling of doughs for producing of the chewy regions containing significant amounts of materials such as honey, fructose and the like.Doughs formulated from such materials are often quite viscous and tacky and present significant difficulties in handling and formation on conventionally employed production equipment. In addition, materials such as fructose and honey undergo browning reactions during baking which lead to differences in color between the chewy regions and crispy regions of the baked product, which differences often are not desired. One of the advantages of the baked cookie products which are produced from the composite dough and process of this invention is that they can be made substantially uniform with respect to color with the exception of materials such as nuts or flavor chips which may be present. To some degree, the color differential can be masked through use of suitable colored ingredients or color additives e.g., chocolate , but in cookies such as chocolate chip cookies or vanilla cookies, for example, the opportunities for color masking are limited.Also, while it is possible to minimize such differences by completely enveloping the chewy cookie dough with the conventional sucrose containing dough, thereby keeping the chewy dough out of direct contact with heating surfaces and out of direct exposure to the heated atmosphere, color differentials may still develop. Summary of the Invention The present invention concerns composite dough products capable of being baked to baked products, such as cookies, and the provision of baked products, and especially cookies, from such dough composites, which have a storage stable plurality of crispy and. chewy regions. Cookies baked from the composite dough of this invention have been found to retain the crispy and chewy textural dichotomy characteristic of freshly baked cookies for extended time periods. The method of the present invention for preparing baked products, such as cookies, which possess storage stable regions of crispy texture and storagestable regions of chewy, moist texture, as hereinafter described, is adaptable to high volume high speed commercial manufacturing requirements. The method hereinafter described furthermore provides baked ts aril codcies which present a substantially uniform color throughout the crumb structure of the product. The process hereinafter described comprises the steps of a. preparing a first dough comprising flour, shortening, water and a readily crystallizable sugar component b. preparing a second dough comprising flour, shortening, water and an in situ developable crystallization resistant sugar component, said developable component comprising an enzyme and, if required, an added substrate for the enzyme, wherein, at the conditions of baking, the enzyme acts upon its substrate to convert the substrate, at least in part, to materials which are crystallization resistant or only slowly crystallizable , bind water and inhibit crystallization of any readily crystallizable sugars in the second dough c. forming a composite dough by surrounding or sandwiching the second dough within or between the first dough such that no surface of the second dough is, during subsequent baking, in direct contact with a heated baking surface or directly exposed to a heated atmosphere and d. baking the composite dough, at conditions which do not significantly inactivate the enzyme in the second dough, to form a final baked product in which there are present, after equilibration, regions contributed by said first dough exhibiting a crispy texture and regions contributed by said second dough exhibiting a moist, chewy texture. Thus cookies which exhibit a storage stable plurality of crispy and chewy regions and which are substantially uniform in colour throughout their cross section and exterior surface can beEMI7.1 prepared by enrobing an enzyme containing cookie dough with a sugar containing cookie dough, or by sandwiching the enzyme containing cookie dough between upper and lower layers of a sugar containing dough, and then baking the dough composite at a temperature and under conditions at which the enzyme is active in generating materials required for formation of a crystallization resistant sugar component in the inner, enzyme containing dough.The outer dough layer containing the crystallizing sugar bakes to an outermost crisp region, while the activity of the enzyme present in the inner dough results in a discrete band or region of a moist and soft or chewy baked dough between the layers of the baked crisp dough. This invention also provides a composite dough for preparing a baked1 crumb continuous flour based product having distinct storage stable regions of crumb having a crispy texture and distinct regions of crumb having a chewy texture, said composite dough comprising a. a first dough portion, bakeable to a crispy crumb structure comprising flour, water, shortening and sugar and b. a second dough portion bakeable to a chewy, moist crumb structure including as ingredients thereof at least flour1 water, shortening and an enzyme, wherein at least one ingredient of the second dough it acted upon by the enzyme when the composite dough is baked to provide in the baked second dough an amount of crystallization resistant sugar effective to bind water and to inhibit the crystallization of any readily crystallizable sugar present in the second dough c. wherein the second dough portion is enrobed in the first dough portion and d. the composite dough is bakeable to a product in which there is present after equilibration of moisture present in the baked product, discrete regions of crumb contributed by the first dough having a crispy texture, and discrete regionsOf crumb contributed by the second dough having a moist, chewy texture. Detailed Description of the Invention In accordance with this invention, a baked, flourbased product is provided which, long after its initial preparation, substantially duplicates the combined crispy and chewy textural dichotomy characteristics of freshly baked products.While the invention is applicable to a wide variety of product shapes, sizes and formulations, the description will focus on the preparation of products recognizable as cookies , i.e., small cakes which are prepared from doughs or batters. No attempt is made herein to distinguish between flourcontaining baked products referred to by traditional category names e.g., cookie, cake, biscuit, cracker, or the like, because the various products referred to by one of these category names are often virtually identical in major or basic ingredients to other products traditionally given different category names.Similarly, the terms batter and dough define overlapping compositions. Thus, the only significance which is ascribed to the foregoing terms and category names is that which can be ascribed on the basis of historical usage, rather than technical significance or applicability of the present invention. The baked cookies of the present invention are of the so called crumb continuous type. In contrast to iced cookies, glazed cookies, filled cookies, sandwich type cookies, etc., the crumb continuous cookies of this invention are characterized by a substantially continuous cookie crumb matrix visibly extending throughout its cross section, typically interrupted only by the presence of additives separate from the dough such as nuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, etc., conventionally employed in drop type cookies. As employed herein, the term crystallization resistant sugar means a sugar component which contributes sweetness to the baked product made from the dough in which it is contained, is capable of binding water at the conditions of storage of the baked cookies and is only slowly crystallizable relative to sucrose , if at all, under the conditions of baking and storage employed . An important feature of the present invention is the in situ development of the crystallization resistant sugar component in the chewy cookie dough, rather than including the crystallization resistant sugar component as an ingredient of the dough prior to baking. The crystallization resistant sugar component, developed in situ in the composite cookie dough of this invention through enzymatic action, can comprise any of the materials capable of being generated in dough products through enzymatic conversion and which,either alone or in combination, meet the definition of crystallization resistant , given above. Among these materials are glucose, maltose, invert sugar, fructose, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, honey, dextrins, low molecular weight saccharides, and the like. Any one or more of these materials may also be overtly added to the enzyme containing dough as part of its initial formulation, so long as the levels of use are sufficiently low to preclude difficulties with respect to processing of the dough and browning reactions. As employed in the context of the present invention, the term chewy is intended to define textures which possess a discernible degree of plasticity. Chewiness also connotes impressions of softness and moistness. Crispness and chewiness can be described in terms of taste panel tests which take as standards the texture of fresh saltine crackers having a moisture content of about 2 rating of 0 and a freshly baked cookie having a distinctly chewy texture throughout rating of 10 i.e., chewy cookies prepared in accordance with the following recipe 2 3 c. sugar 1 4 c. butter or regular margarine 1 tsp. ground ginger 1 2 tsp. ground cinnamon 1 2 tsp. baking soda 1 2 tsp. salt 1 2 tsp. vanilla 1 egg 1 2 c. honey 1 1 2 c. sifted flour The cookies are prepared by combining 2 3 cup of sugar, butter, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and creaming the ingredients until they are light and fluffy. Next the eggs are added and beat in until the mixture is very fluffy. The honey is then blended in, followed by the blending in of the flour a little at a time. The dough is dropped by teaspoonfuls 2 1 2 inches apart onto a lightly greased baking sheet, baked at 3500F for 10 to 15 minutes until lightly browned and removed at once from the baking sheet to racks to cool thoroughly. Employing the rating scale described above, the chewy portion of the product of this. invention preferably has a rating of at least 3 and most preferably at least 5. The crispy por tion preferably has a rating of less than 5 and most preferably less than 2. The regions should show a difference in ratings of at least 2 units, and most preferably at least 5 units. The baked cookies prepared in accordance with the present invention are also storage stable both in the sense of microbial stability and maintenance of their freshly baked tex tural dichotomy over long periods of time. Preferably, the cookies of this invention maintain their crispy chewy textural difference, found in the cookie shortly after baking, for at least about 3 weeks. A significant feature of the present invention is the utilization of a dough composite to provide a final, crumb continuous baked cookie product having crispy and chewy regions attributable to the different doughs utilized in making the composite. The dough employed for contributing the crispy regions of the final baked product can be a conventional sucrose containing dough comprised of flour, water, shortening and sucrose, as well as other optional ingredients such as flavorants, colorants, nuts, flavor chips and the like. Thus, the dough which contributes the crispy region will contain a readily crystallizable sugar comprising sucrose. In addition to sucrose, the dough which ccntributes the crispy region may also include crystallization resistant sugars such as maltose, fructose, honey, invert sugar, etc. so long as such materials are employed at levels which will not inhibit crystallization of the sucrose, will not cause the dough to be difficult to handle or process, will not cause the dough to become undesirably colored due to browning reactions, and will not bind water to such a degree as to detract from the desired crispness of the baked dough. Generally, the level of such materials in the crispy cookie dough will not exceed about 15 by weight of the sucrose present in the dough which contributes the crispy region, and will not exceed 5 to 10 by weight of the overall crispy dough formulation. The dough formulation employed to provide the moist, chewy regions in the final baked cookie comprises, at a minimum, flour, water, shortening and an enzyme. As will be explained in greater detail below, the enzyme is chosen so as to result in the in situ generation within the chewy dough formulation of a crystallization resistant sugar component. The flour and shortening employed in the doughs used in the present invention are selected from conventional ingredient lines. For example, the shortening can be any edible fat or oil or mixtures thereof suitable for cooking or baking and may further include conventional food grade emulsifiers. The flour can be any comminuted cereal grain or edible seed meal such as wheat flour, corn flour, corn starch, barley flour, and the like. The dough may contain typical flavorants and colorants including solid or semi solid ingredients such as chocolate chips or raisinsl. The water content of the doughs generally will be such that the moisture content of a cookie baked therefrom will be less than about 10 by weight, typically between about 4 to 8 by weight, and such that the water activity aw of a cookie baked therefrom in conjunction with the use of suitable waterbinding materials in the formulation will be in the range of from about 0.25 to about 0.80. The enzyme employed herein is selected to act upon one or more of the components of the cookie dough to provide the crystallization resistant sugar component. Of course, if the recipe for the cookie dough selected for use does not include a substrate or a sufficient amount of substrate for the enzyme, an additional ingredient may be added to the dough because it is a good substrate for the enzyme. Typically, the substrate for the enzyme will be either sugar or a starch component present in the cookie dough. For example, flour, one of the basic cookie dough ingredients mentioned above, typically has a starch content of about 50 by weight and provides a substrate for the enzymatic action of carbohydrases. Enzymes which are suitable for use herein include glycosidases and polysaccharidases which, after acting upon carbohydrates, provide crystallization resistant sugars as a by product of their enzymatic activity. The choice of an enzyme within the glycosidase or polysaccharidase class to employ in a given cookie formulation will depend upon parameters which are conventionally considered in connection with enzymatic processes including baking temperatures and times, pH of the dough, water content, and the relative availability of the substrate to the action of the enzyme. Of course, baking conditions, pH of the cookie dough, etc. may also be adjusted to optimize the activity of the enzyme and, hence, the in situ generation of the crystallization resistant sugar component. Glycosidases hydrolyze simple glycosides and oligosaccharides. An example of a useful enzyme from that class is invertase which acts upon sucrose to provide invert sugar as the by product of its enzymatic action. The entire quantity of sucrose present need not be inverted, so long as a sufficient amount of invert sugar has been produced to inhibit the crystallization of any unconverted sucrose in the baked dough. Invert sugar generated in situ is itself crystallization resistant or only slowly crystallizable relative to sucrose under similar conditions and is capable of binding water. Enzymes suitable for use herein also include polysaccharidases which act upon farinaceous materials to provide lower molecular weight saccharides such as glucose, maltose, modified starches, dextrins, etc. Enzymes of this type include the alpha and beta amylases. Mixtures of different enzymes may also be employed. For example, a primary enzyme e.g., a bacterial alpha amylase may be employed to act upon a complex polysaccharide to provide simple glycosides, dextrins, and or oligosaccharides which are then acted upon by the auxiliary enzyme e.g., a glucosidase to provide a greater amount of lower molecular weight sugars than would be produced by the action of the primary enzyme alone. A particularly suitable enzyme for use herein is alphaamylase which acts upon starch to provide maltose and dextrins.Alpha amylases, such as those obtained from bacterial sources B. subtilis or B. mesentericus are known to be quite heat stable, and have been reported to be able to retain some activity at temperatures as high as 1000C. Enzymes of this type are commercially available and include Fresh N, a product of G.B. Fermentation Industries, Inc., Charlotte, North Carolina, as well as Termamyle and Bacterial Amylase Novo BAN which are products ofNovo Industri A S, Novo All , DK 2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark. When the only substrate for the enzyme is provided by the starch component of the flour in cookie dough, it is preferred to employ the equivalent of about 12 SKB units of alpha amylase to as high as about 2,000 SKB enzyme activity units per 100 grams of starch in the dough. Stated alternatively, the number of SKB units 100 g of flour will typically fall within the range of about 6 1000SKB units, because flour generally includes about a 50 weight percent portion of starch. SRB units may be assayed by the method ofSandstedt, Kneen and Blish, given in Cereal Chemistry, Vol. 16,712 1939 . When the substrate for the enzyme is provided by the starch component of flour,as well as an added pregelatinized starch component in the dough, the SRB units of enzyme employed may be re duced from that given above. For example, a preferred substrate comprises a pregelatinized starch component and cake flour in a weight ratio of about 1 1 10, e.g. 1 1.2 7, wherein the preferred enzyme activity units employed with such a substrate are about 50 to l00G SKB units per 100 grams of the combined substrate. The pH of the cookie dough to which the bacterial alpha amylase is added is preferably about 6.0 to about 7.5 most preferably about 6.2 , assuming that the bacterial alpha amylase containing dough will be baked at a temperature of about 1750F to about 4250F. Thus, the cookie doughs employed in combination with alpha amylase enzyme preferably do not include baking soda or any other ingredient which would place the pH of the dough outside the preferred pH range stated above. Cooking times and oven temperatures may also be adjusted to aid in optimizing the action of the alpha amylase enzyme on the starch substrate. Typical baking times and oven temperatures employed are about 175 to about 4500F, preferably about 200 F to about 4000F for about S to 15 minutes. During baking, the cookie may be incubated for an extended time period at oven tem perature lower than that normally employed to bake cookies, in order to provide an extended time period over which the enzyme is active and not heat inactivated during the baking process. The incubation period may be followed by the completion of baking at higher enzyme inactivating oven temperatures. For example, the cookies may be baked briefly, e.g. about 1 3 minutes at oven temperatures of about 425 4750F to rapidly bring the enzyme con taining dough in the center of the composite to optimal temper atures, then at a second lower temperature for an extended period of time to maintain optimal activity e.g. about 11SOP to about 2000F for about 25 to 75 minutes ,followed by a third baking temperature at a higher temperature during which the baking of the cookie is completed.During baking of the prepared dough composite, in situ enzymatic conversion of substrate in the chewy dough occurs so as to result in the presence in such dough of a crystallization resistant sugar component. If the enzyme is not totally inactivated during the baking process, the conversion at room temperature of substrate may continue in some degree even after the cookies have been baked. In the process of the present invention, the enzymecontaining cookie dough is either sandwiched between two layers of the cookie dough productive of a crispy region, or the enzymecontaining dough is completely enveloped or surrounded by the crispy cookie dough. For example, the enzyme containing dough may be enrobed in the dough which is productive of the crispy region, by flattening a portion of the latter and employing it to enrobe a spherical portion of the enzyme containing dough. An enrobing process equivalent to that described above may be performed automatically by conventional apparatus, such as theModel 207, Rheon Encrusting Machine, available from the Rheon Automatic Machinery Company. The dough employed to make the crispy region and the dough employed to make the chewy region may contain the same ingredients, differing only by the presence of an enzyme in the dough that will be baked to the chewy region, or if desired, different doughs may be employed to form the outer crispy layer and the inner chewy region of the baked product. In addition, a substrate additive for the enzyme may be included in the enzymecontaining dough, but not included in the crispy dough. Moreover, by adjusting the amount of dough productive of a chewy region relative to the amount of dough productive of the outer crispy region employed in the composite dough, the ratio of chewy to crispy regions in the final baked product may be adjusted as desired.For cookie products having the crispy chewy textural dichotomy of a fresh baked cookie, a weight ratio of dough productive of a chewy region relative to dough productive of a crispy region of about 0.8 3.0 1, and preferably about 1 1 may suitably be employed. After equilibration of moisture in the baked cookie, the result is a product in which, in the outer upper and lower layers, a crispy texture is achieved by reason of the crystallization of the sucrose therein and the concomitant loss of moisture and bound water associated with crystallization. In the inner regions of the product, however, the presence of an in situ generated crystallization resistant sugar component results in a moist, chewy texture which persists in that region during storage for extended time periods. A number of important features are attained through the present invention. For example, it will be appreciated that the enzymatic processes which are involved in the present invention are designed to render the entire chewy dough bakeable to a chewy cookie region in the composite dough of this invention. As such, the processes of this invention differ from those described in the earlier noted patents of Moses and Youngquist et al., wherein the enzymatic processes are designed to produce, from a single dough, a baked cookie containing both chewy and crisp textural regions.The enzymatic processes involved in preparation of the chewy cookie regions used in the present invention are performed in a way such that enzymatic activity generally occurs throughout the chewy dough e.g., through use of enzymes which are not inactivated by the temperatures encountered in any portion of the cookie during baking . At the same time, appropriate choice of enzyme and substrate levels will insure that enzymatic activity does not occur to any significant degree in the upper and lower or surrounding crispy dough regions. This aim is also aided by the fact that the temperatures attained during baking in the crispy dough regions being in contact with the heating surface or directly exposed to heated atmosphere result in rapid enzyme inactivation. In addition, it will be appreciated that neither of the doughs employed in the present invention contains, in its original formulation, the quantity of crystallization resistant, water binding materials employed in prior processes for genera tion of chewy cookie regions . Thus, while each of the crispy and chewy doughs of the present invention may optionally be formulated ab initio to contain certain levels of such materials, the present invention relies upon the generation of the major proportion of such materials in situ in the chewy dough to obtain a dough bakeable to a chewy cookie region. An important advantage achieved through this manner of processing is the ability to begin with essentially conventional, easily processible dough compositions for both the crispy and chewy doughs, avoiding the difficult processing problems associated with doughs wherein their ability to be baked to soft, moist, chewy cookie regions is attained by initially formulating the doughs using materials such as fructose, honey, invert sugar and other viscous, tacky materials. Still further, the use of an in situ generated crystallization resistant sugar component contributes to lesser degrees of browning reaction differentials than occur when doughs initially formulated to contain such materials are baked with conventional sucrose containing doughs. In these latter doughs, the browning reactions begin immediately upon the start of the baking cycle in the doughs of the present invention, the materials which might otherwise lead to browning reactions, differinq in intensity from those occurring in the crispy, sucrose containing doughs, are only beginning to come into existence during the baking cycle and thus experience less time for reaction.Also, since some quantity of these in situ generated materials may occur even after the cookie has been baked, obviously little browning will occur in the cooling temperature environment existing after baking. This latter advantage is also significantly aided by maintaining the chewy dough within or between the sucrose containing dough s during baking. By maintaining the chewy dough out of direct contact with baking surfaces and out of direct exposure to the heating atmosphere, browning reactions are minimized. As a result of these features, it is possible to prepare baked cookies from dough composites wherein the doughs do not develop significantly different colors during baking and produce a baked cookie having a substantially uniform crumb color throughout its cross section. Features of the present invention will be explained further with reference to the following examples. EMlUtPLE 1 A composite cookie was prepared from the following recipe Ingredient Amount Cake Flour 597 g American Beauty Baking Powder 2 tsp. Ingredient Amount Baking Soda 1 tsp. Solid Shorteningl 397 g MFB0,Hunt Wesson Co. Sucrose 599 g Eggs 4 whole Milk 4 tbs. Vanilla 4 tsp. Salt 1 tsp. Pregelatinized Starch 1 cup Binasol,B.E.Staley Co., Decatur, Ill. Hydroenated palm and soybean oil. The eggs, sugar, shortening and vanilla were creamed in a Hobart mixer for two minutes at slow speed, the milk was then added and creamed with the other ingredients for an additional two minutes. A premix of the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and starch was then added slowly to the mixture and blended in a Hobart mixer at low and then high speeds. After mixing, the dough was refrigerated for about one hour. One half ounce por tions of this dough were flattened into a rectangular form and used to enrobe inner, spherical one half ounce portions of dough prepared by the above procedure, modified by the addition of 2.0 g of or bacterial alpha amylase enzyme from B. subtilis, Clinton Corn Products, Inc., 1400 SKB per gram of enzyme . The enzyme was added to the ingredients given above in the form of a suspension in the milk. The composite dough was baked at 4000F for 10 minutes, cooled and sealed into airtight packages. The packages were opened after a one, two and three week storage period and the organoleptic properties of the cookies qualitatively evaluated in comparison with controls prepared by enrobing an equally sized portion of enzyme free dough. The composite, enzyme containing cookies retained a moist, chewy center and a crisp exterior throughout the test period. EXAMPLE 2 A composite cookie was prepared from the following formulation Ingredient Outer Dough Inner Dough Flour 454 g 354 g Shortening 184 g 184 g Pregelatinized Starch 100 g Sucrose 202 79 g 281 g Salt 3.2 g 3.2 g Baking Soda 4.3 g 4.3 g Water 41 g 100 g Eggs 112 g 112 g NFDM 5.4 g 5.4 g Enzyme Fresh Ns, G.B. 10.0 Fermentation Ind.,Inc., Charlotte, N.C., 27 SKB gram of enzyme To prepare the inner dough, the eggs, sucrose and shortening were creamed for two minutes in a mixer at slow speed.A mixture of a suspension of the enzyme in the water was creamed in over 2 minutes, followed by a premix of the remaining ingredients which were slowly added, then blended at low and then high speeds. The outer dough was prepared similarly, except that the enzyme and modified starch were omitted and 79 g of the sucrose was added after addition of the final premix. The refrigerated doughs were formed into composites according to the procedure ofExample 1 and baked into cookies which exhibited organoleptic properties similar to those of Example 1. In useful modifications of the procedure of Example 3, the enzyme level was increased to 18.0 g and baking times of 13 minutes at 4000F and 15 minutes at 3500F, respectively, were employed for both dough composites. EXAMPLE 3 The procedure of Example l is followed with the following modifications a the baking soda is omitted from the inner dough, or b lactic acid 80 is added to the inner dough in order to lower the pH of the inner dough to a range which would optimize the activity of the B. subtilis alpha amylase enzyme to about 6.0 6.5 before baking and 7.0 7.S after baking .Baking is carried out for three minutes 4600F , 1 hour 1400F and 6.5 minutes 3750F , or alternatively for 8 minutes at an average of 400at band oven .
