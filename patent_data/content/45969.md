# Catalyst and use of same for polymerizing olefins.

## Abstract
A transition metal compound and a metal halide com pound are chemically combined to form a composition of matter. The composition of matter is mixed with a precipitat ing agent to form an active olefin polymerization catalyst. The catalyst can be further treated with a halide ion exchanging source to form an active olefin polymerization catalyst. Prepolymer is deposited on the catalyst s in an amount effective to reduce polymer fines when the catalyst s are used in polymerization processes.
