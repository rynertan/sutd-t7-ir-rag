# Superalloy article repair method and alloy powder mixture.

## Abstract
A powder alloy mixture for use in a method of repairing high temperature superalloy articles includes a first, higher temperature alloy powder in the range of about 35 65 weight percent of the mixture. The first alloy powder is based on at least one element selected from Ni and Co and is characterized as having good strength and environmental resistance along with the substantial absence of melting point depressant elements selected from Si and B in amounts greater than about 1 Si and 0.5 B. The second alloy powder is of a lower melting temperature alloy of Ni Cr Si B Co and is caracterized by the substantial ab sence of C.
