# Low power CMOS reference generator with low impedance driver.

## Abstract
A low power, low output impedance, CMOS voltage reference with high source sink current driving capability. A CMOS current mirror preamplifier includes matched transis tor pairs having their W L ratios scaled to reduce the level of current to the subthreshold region. A CMOS source follower output stage also has its transistors biased in the sub threshold region. Circuitry for protecting the preamplifier from the effects of supply voltage and output voltage bumps is also disclosed.
