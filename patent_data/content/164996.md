# GRAPH MANAGER FOR A REDUCTION PROCESSOR EVALUATING PROGRAMS STORED AS BINARY DIRECTED GRAPHS EMPLOYING VARIABLE FREE APPLICATIVE LANGUAGE CODES

## Abstract
A parallel register transfer mechanism and control sec tion have been disclosed above for use in a reduction processor for the evaluation of expressions of a variable free applicative language stored as binary directed graphs. The expressions are reduced through a series of transformations until a result is obtained.
