# An electronic sphygmomanometer.

## Abstract
An electronic sphygmonanometer comprises a K sound detection circuit SD for detecting Koroktoff sound from a microphone, a pressure transducer 17 for converting pressure to an electric signal, a pressure pulse detection circuit 20 for detecting a pressure pulse signal from the electric signal and a double integral type converter for converting an analog output of an amplifier 18 to a digital signal. An arithmetic unit 11 receives the output signals of the K sound detection circuit SD , the pressure pulse detection circuit 20 and the converter 8 drives a display device 12 for indicating systolic and diastolic pressures digitally. A detection circuit S includes the K sound detec tion circuit SD , the pressure transducer 17 , the amplifier 18 , the pressure pulse detection circuit 20 and an analog section 19a of the converter. A logic circuit L includes a digital section 19b of the converter 8 , the arithmetic unit 11 and the digital display 12 . A plurality of signal lines WR connected between the detection circuit S and the logic circuit L and include a first signal line S5 for transmitting the output signal from the K sound detection circuit to the arithmetic unit, a second signal line S4 for transmitting the output of the pressure pulse detection circuit 20 to the analog section 19a and a third signal line S1, S3 for transmitting an output of the analog section 19a to the digital section 19b .
