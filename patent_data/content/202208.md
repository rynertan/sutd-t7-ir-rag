# Heat treated high strength bimetallic cylinder.

## Abstract
A high strength bimetallic cylinder having a wear resistant ferrous liner or inlay and capable of withstanding high stresses is provided by a heat treatment process wherein the cylinder steel is transformed into the austenitic phase, followed by rapidly cooling the cylinder to an intermediate temperature so that the ferrous outer housing is transformed to a bainitic structure, and then slowly cooling the cylinder to transform the ferrous liner into a martensitic structure.
