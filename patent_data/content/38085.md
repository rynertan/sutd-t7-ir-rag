# Buried heterostructure laser diode and method for making the same.

## Abstract
The buried heterostructure laser diode BHLD is made of InGaAsP crystal layers on an InP substrate. To provide a BHLD having an improved linearity of the active layer stripe and a reduced optical waveguide loss and to provide a plurality of BHLDs having different lasing wavelenghts formed on the same substrate the BHLD of the invention has such structure that an active layer is provided in a semiconductor region forming a mesa stripe, and except for the top surface portion of the mesa stripe the side surface portion of the mesa stripe and the reminder are covered by a current block ing layer. A current confining layer covers only this cur rent blocking layer and a clad layer covers this current blocking layer and the top surface portion of the mesa stripe. A method for producing the above BHLD includes the processes of uniformly growing a necessary layer or layers and an active layer on a substrate then form ing a mesa stripe including the active layer so as to have a predetermined stripe width, thereafter selectively growing a current blocking layer and a current confining layer successively on the mesa shaped structure except for the top surface of the mesa stripe, and subsequently growing a clad layer on the top surface of the mesa stripe and on the current confining layer.
