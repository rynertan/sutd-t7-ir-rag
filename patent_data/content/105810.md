# AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR HAVING AN ANTI DECOUPLING DEVICE

## Abstract
An electrical connector assembly including a pair of mating shells 100, 200 having end faces 122, 224 on dielectric inserts 110, 210 and a coupling nut 300 rotatably mounted on first shell 100 , coupling nut 300 including an elongated a generally U shaped passageway 142, 146, 144 sized to receive a coupling pin 28 on second shell 200 , the passageway forming an integral cantilevered latch spring 160 of the type having adjacent its deflectable end a detent 162 for captivating the pin 280 , rotation of coupling nut 300 bringing end faces 122, 224 into abutment to stop axial advance but permit continued rotation to allow cou pling pin 280 to advance along the passageway to deflect latch spring 162 downwardly and reach the detent 162 whereupon latch spring 162 springs forwardly to captivate coupling pin 280 therein.
