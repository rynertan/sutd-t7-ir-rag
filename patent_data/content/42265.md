# Record material carrying a colour developer composition.

## Abstract
A colour developer for use in a pressure or heat sensitive record material comprises a particulate amorphous hydrated silica hydrated alumina composite in which the hydrated silica and hydrated aiumina are chemically bound and in which the mean alumina content on a dried weight basis is up to 7.5 , based on the total weight of silica and alumina. The composite may be metal modified, e.g. with copper.
