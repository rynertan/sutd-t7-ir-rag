# Geodesic dome lens antenna.

## Abstract
The antenna of the geodesic lens type is based on optical principles and provides wide angle scanning of a narrow beam. The exact shape of the domed structure 10 is found by solving an integral equation and results in nearly perfect focus in the scan plane. A dielectric loaded flared horn 20 is attached to the feed circle 15 of the domed structure and focusses energy in the plane orthogonal to the scan plane. The cross sectional shape of the outer curvature of the dielectric 21 is elliptical. Since the structure is cir cularly symmetrical, constant beam shape, wide angle scanning, and a rapid scan rate are possible.
