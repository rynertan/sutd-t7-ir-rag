## Description
This invention relates to a pulse width modulation inverter apparatus comprising a frequency setting part for setting the frequency of the fundamental wave of an output voltage to be supplied to a load a control circuit part generating a pulse width modulation signal on the basis of the fundamental wave and a carrier wave in response to the signal from said frequency setting part a phase drive part receiving the pulse width modulation signal from said control circuit part and a DC power source part connected to said phase drive part. A known pulse width modulation PWM inverter apparatus of this type IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, Vol. 19 1983 , No. 2, pages 212 to 216 is used in a variable speed drive DC AC converter for an induction motor. The latter has the merits of being stout and inexpensive and is presently widely employed. The rotation speed of the induction motor is principally determined by the frequency of the supplied voltage, and a variable speed is strongly demanded nowadays for the induction motor referred to hereinafter as a motor from the viewpoints of comfortableness and energy saving. As a means for solving this problem, a commercial AC voltage is converted into a DC voltage, and in the PWM inverter apparatus, by suitable switching, an AC voltage having any desired frequency and voltage is generated again. However, it is known that, when such a PWM inverter apparatus is used, a PWM voltage in pulse form is generated as an output voltage, and a harmonic current is supplied to the motor, with the result that a force having frequencies two times as high as various harmonic components is generated in the primary windings of the motor, and the laminate forming the stator core of the motor is vibrated to generate magnetic noise. At the same time, bipolar transistors are used presently as elements making switching operation for realizing the DC AC conversion. In view of the properties of such elements, the upper limit of the carrier frequency of the PWM voltage is about 4 kHz, and a carrier frequency of about 2 kHz is commonly used. Accordingly, the motor generates magnetic noise at 16 Hz 20 kHz included in the audible range and has been defective in that it provides a source of discomfort. Further, in the PWM signal generating part generating the PWM voltage, a fundamental wave and a triangular wave providing the carrier frequency are compared to generate the PWM signal for each phase. The ratio a b between the amplitude a of the fundamental wave and the amplitude b of the triangular wave is called the modulation rate m which represents an output voltage relative to an input voltage. There is always the relation a b, and, theoretically, the output voltage generated is the same as the input voltage when a b. In order to efficiently drive the motor, it is necessary to maintain constant the ratio of the output voltage frequency. Thus, the frequency of the fundamental wave is changed while, at the same time, the amplitude a is changed, and the carrier frequency of the triangular wave is selected to be about 2 kHz so as to drive the motor at about the maximum modulation rate m 95 . However, as described already, noise having a frequency two times as high as the carrier frequency is generated, and, especially, when the motor is driven at a low speed, that is, when the noise of the motor itself is low, magnetic noise is heard which is felt uncomfortable. Therefore, studies have been made to increase the carrier frequency thereby generating magnetic noise which exceeds the audible range of a man. IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, Vol. 19 1983 , pages 212 to 216 disclose the use of MOSFET transistors as power switches in the phase drive means of the PWM inverter apparatus operated at a high switching frequency of 18 kHz or higher. However, when the carrier frequency is increased, the minimum output pulse width at the maximum modulation rate provides a frequency about 20 times as high as the carrier frequency. Accordingly, there has been such a problem that stable generation of the PWM signal at the high carrier frequency and at the maximum modulation rate of 95 is difficult. USP 4 020 361 discloses a PWM inverter apparatus in a switching mode power controller for a music or a voice signal. With the latter one as a reference signal, the power controller must span a relatively large dynamic range, and measures are taken to overcome limitations due to the maximum available switching frequency. It is an object of the present invention to provide for a PWM inverter apparatus of the above referenced type in which an audible magnetic noise produced by a load is greatly reduced while simultaneously a reduction of the efficiency is relatively suppressed. One solution to attain this object is according to the invention characterized in that said control circuit part is responsive to the signal from said frequency setting part to increase the carrier frequency of said pulse width modulation signal when said setting frequency is decreased and vice versa, whereby the frequency range lies between 8 kHz and 24 kHz. The resulting variation in the carrier frequency thereby complies with the variation of noise level generated by the load itself and audible magnetic noise does not occur while a reduction of the efficiency is relatively suppressed. An alternative solution to the above object for a variable speed drive DC AC converter for an induction motor including a pulse width modulation apparatus of the before referenced type is characterized in that the carrier frequency of said pulse width modulation signal from said control circuit part is selected to have a predetermined value in the range of 8 kHz to 16 kHz. By selecting the carrier frequency in this range, audible magnetic noise is sufficiently decreased to become the same as the operating sound generated from the motor when driven by an AC power source while maintaining reduction of the efficiency relatively suppressed. The drawings show an embodiment of the present invention, in which Fig. 1 is a view showing the fundamental structure of the PWM inverter apparatus Fig. 2 is a view showing the basic principle of PWM signal generation in the PWM inverter apparatus Fig. 3 is a view showing the PWM signal Fig. 4 is a view showing the PWM output voltage Fig. 5 is a view showing the current supplied to the motor by the PWM inverter apparatus Fig. 6 is a graph showing the noise value relative to a change in the carrier frequency in the PWM inverter apparatus Fig. 7 is a graph showing the input electric power value relative to a change in the carrier frequency Fig. 8 is a view showing the fundamental structure of the PWM signal generating circuit and Fig. 9 is a graph showing the carrier frequency relative to a change in the set frequency of the PWM signal generating circuit. Referring to Fig. 1, 1 designates a frequency setting part setting the frequency of the output voltage of the PWM inverter apparatus, 2 designates a control circuit part receiving the signal from the frequency setting part 1 and applying its output signal to gate drive parts of individual phases, and 3 designate phase drive parts which constitute a final output part of the PWM inverter apparatus for effecting the DC AC conversion. Each phase drive part 3 is composed of a first power switching element 4, a first gate drive part 5, a second power switching element 6, and a second gate drive part 7. 8 designates a DC power source part connected across the power switching elements 4 and 6 of the individual phase drive parts 3. 9 designates a motor connected to neutral points x, y and z of the individual phase drive parts 3 to be driven by the output voltages of these parts. When the frequency is set in the frequency setting part 1, the control circuit part 2 receives the setting signal and generates fundamental waves of the set frequency having a phase interval of 120 in electrical angle. As shown in Fig. 2, the fundamental wave A of one phase at the set frequency is compared with a triangular wave B to generate, for each phase, a PWM signal as shown in Fig. 3. The PWM signals are applied to the first gate drive parts 5 of the individual phase drive parts 3, while, inverted signals of the PWM signals are applied to the second gate drive parts 7, thereby alternately turning on off the first and second switching elements 4 and 6. At each of the neutral points x, y and z of the individual phase drive parts 3, an output voltage of the set frequency which is a pulse voltage as shown in Fig. 4 appears to be applied to the motor 9. When the PWM signal voltage shown in Fig. 4 is applied to the motor 9, a current including harmonic components as shown in Fig. 5 is produced by the primary windings of the motor 9 to drive the motor 9. As described already, it is known that the flow of a harmonic current generates magnetic noise having a frequency two times as high as the carrier frequency. The audible range of a man is about 16 Hz 20 kHz. Therefore, when elements capable of high speed power switching, for example, power MOS FET s were used as the first and second power switching elements 4 and 6, and the carrier frequency was increased as shown in Fig. 6, it could be confirmed that the noise value was decreased greatly from about 8 kHz, and, at about 24 kHz, became the same as the operating sound generated when the motor was driven by an AC power source. As described above, theoretically, the motor generates magnetic noise having a frequency two times as high as the carrier frequency. Actually, however, noise having the same frequency as the carrier frequency was also generated due to the difference between the characteristics of the individual switching elements and due to external noise. Further, as the carrier frequency is increased as shown in Fig. 6, the switching loss and snubber loss increase to reduce the efficiency. Therefore, when the carrier frequency is selected to lie within the range of 8 kHz 24 kHz, a PWM inverter apparatus can be provided, by which generation of the magnetic noise of the audible range is greatly reduced and reduction of the efficiency is relatively suppressed. When the efficiency is especially noted, an efficient PWM inverter apparatus can be provided, by which generation of the magnetic noise in the audible range is relatively suppressed, by selecting the carrier frequency to lie within the range of 8 kHz 16 kHz. Further, when the generation of the magnetic noise in the audible range is especially noted, a PWM inverter apparatus can be provided, by which the mangetic noise is rendered inaudible and the reduction of the efficiency is relatively suppressed, by selecting the carrier frequency to lie within the range of 16 kHz 24 kHz. A practical example of the control circuit part 2 for increasing the carrier frequency will now be described with reference to Fig. 8. 1 designates the frequency setting part setting the frequency of the output voltage of the PWM inverter apparatus, and 2 designates the control circuit part. The control circuit part 2 includes a fundamental wave oscillating part 10, a triangular wave oscillating part 11 generating a triangular wave of variable frequency in response to the signal from the frequency setting part 1, and a comparing part 12 generating the PWM signal by comparing the output of the fundamental wave oscillating part 10 and that of the triangular wave oscillating part 11. The triangular wave oscillating part 11 is composed of a first OP amplifier 30, bias resistors 31, 32 for this first OP amplifier 30, charge discharge resistors 33, 34 for this first OP amplifier 30, an integrating capacitor 35 for the first OP amplifier 30, a charge discharge switching transistor 36, a second OP amplifier 37, and external resistors 38, 39 for the second OP amplifier 37. When the frequency setting part 1 sets the frequency by a DC voltage, the fundamental wave oscillating part 10 oscillates a fundamental wave having the frequency and amplitude based on the DC voltage value. At the same time, the setting DC voltage from the frequency setting part 1 is applied to the triangular wave oscillating part 11. This triangular wave oscillating part 11 is a conventional, constant amplitude variable frequency triangular wave oscillating circuit, and the voltage obtained by dividing the setting DC voltage value by the resistors 31 and 32 is applied to the positive input terminal of the first OP amplifier 30 having its output negatively fed back through the integrating capacitor 35. The first OP amplifier 30 generates its output so as to maintain the same potential at the negative input terminal. When the output of the second OP amplifier 37 making comparator operation with the potential obtained by dividing the voltage by the resistors 38 and 39 is Low, the charge discharge switching transistor 36 is turned off to generate an output discharging the integrating capacitor. When the output potential drops to the potential provided by the external resistors 38 and 39 for the second OP amplifier 37, the output of the second OP amplifier 37 turns into Hi to turn on the charge discharge switching transistor 36, so that, conversely, the output of the first OP amplifier 30 charges the integrating capacitor 35. With such a circuit structure, the output N of the first OP amplifier 30 generates a carrier frequency whose amplitude is constant and determined by the potential provided by the external voltage dividing resistors 38 and 39 associated with the second OP amplifier 37 and which has a relation between it and the setting frequency of the fundamental wave as shown in Fig. 9. This triangular wave and the output of the fundamental wave oscillating part 10 are applied to the comparing part 12 to be compared to provide the resultant output. Thus, the carrier frequency is high, when the setting frequency is low, while, the carrier frequency decreases with the increase in the setting frequency, and a PWM signal achieving the maximum modulation rate of 95 is obtained. Therefore, when the control circuit part is constructed to generate such a PWM signal, the magnetic noise generated from the motor has a frequency which is the same as or two times as high as the carrier frequency. When the rotation speed of the motor becomes further higher, the mechanical sound generated from the motor itself becomes more loud, and the magnetic noise is hardly audible. Therefore, when the motor rotates at a low speed, the carrier frequency is increased to prevent generation of the audible magnetic noise from the motor, while, when the motor rotates at a high speed, the carrier frequency is decreased, whereby a PWM inverter apparatus can be provided which can realize the maximum modulation rate of 95 , and in which the audible magnetic noise generated from the motor is cancelled by the mechanical sound generated from the motor itself. In the embodiment described above, the incremental signal from the frequency setting part 1 acts to decrease the carrier frequency generated from the triangular wave oscillating part 11. This is because a load is considered where the noise value increases with the increase in the rotation speed. However, in the case of any other loads too, the control circuit part may be suitably constructed so that the frequency setting signal can deal with whatever change of the carrier frequency. As described above, according to the PWM inverter apparatus of the present invention in which the carrier frequency of the PWM generated voltage is selected to lie within the range of 8 kHz 24 kHz, the rotation speed of whatever induction motor can be controlled so that generation of the audible magnetic noise is greatly reduced, and reduction of the efficiency is relatively suppressed. Also, similarly, according to the PWM inverter apparatus in which the carrier frequency of the PWM generated voltage is made variable, a load where the noise value increases with the increase in the rotation speed of the motor can be controlled so that the audible magnetic noise may not be generated. Also, in any other cases, control can be made so as to prevent generation of the magnetic noise when the modulation rate is low and so as to increase the modulation rate when generation of the magnetic noise is allowable to a certain extent. Therefore, the utility of the PWM inverter apparatus can be greatly enhanced.
