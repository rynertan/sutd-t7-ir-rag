# Composite explosives and processes for making same.

## Abstract
A new arrangement of matter is developed which can be formulated to be a high explosive, a propellant or a gas generator. The new arrangement of matter in its explosive embodiment is known as a microknit composite explosive MCX in which an essentially anhydrous mixture of inorga nic salts, surfactants and organic fuels is prepared while the oxidizer is molten, and a microcrystalline property is created which imparts a hard, machinable characteristic to the arrangement of matter. The invention includes three proces ses for making MCX compositions 1 dissolving surfactants, crystal habit modifiers, thicken ers or combinations into the molten oxidizer in a manner which permits supercooling with subsequent solidifica tion 2 forming an unstable oil continuous emulsion as a pre liminary step, followed by a controlled disruption of the oil phase continuum which causes the composition to solidify after supercooling and 3 retarding crystal nucleation in salt continuous emul sions by introducing surfactants, thickeners, crystal habit modifiers or combinations, along with immiscible fuels, resulting in supercooling and subsequent solidifi cation to a hard composition.
