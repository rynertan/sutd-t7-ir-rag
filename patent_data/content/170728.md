# Apparatus for gas pressure bonding, hot isostatic pressing or the like.

## Abstract
An apparatus for gas pressure bonding, hot isostatic pressing or the like in which a workpiece may be treated at elevated temperatures and pressures comprises an elon gate cylindrical pressure vessel 10 for enclosing a furnace. The furnace comprises an insulated bottom 14 and an insulated hood 13 with openings near the top and bottom. The insulating hood 13 encloses a workspace with the bottom 14 . Means for heating 16 the workspace and means for cooling the pressure vessel 10 are provided. The improvements according to this disclosure are means 18 for establishing a first circulating flow of pressurized fluid down along the interior of the pressure vessel wall, and means 17 for establishing a second circulating flow of pressurized fluid down through the workspace. Heat ex change between the two circulating flows of pressurized fluid after the first flow has been cooled by flowing down along the interior wall of the pressure vessel 10 and after the second flow has been heated by flowing down over the workpiece in the workspace provides for effective tem perature control in the workspace. The flow rate of at least one circulating flow of pressurized fluid is positively estab lished by pumps 18 or fans.
