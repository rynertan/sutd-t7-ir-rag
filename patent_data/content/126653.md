## Description
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO MICRO STRAINERS FOR USE IN WATER PURIFICATION The present invention relates to microstrainers for use in water purification. Micro straining units for water purification conventionally comprise a revolving drum into which water to be strained or purified is caused to flow at one open end of the drum, the water then passing through a filtering screen cladding the periphery of the drum. The screen is continuously washed clean of suspended solids, organisms and other materials filtered out by the screen by means of water jets or water sprays directed onto the outside of the screen at the top of the drum, above the free surface of the flow, the solids and other materials washed off the screen being collected by a hopper or hoppers inside the rotating drum, the hoppers exhausting continuously through a stationary pipe arranged along the rotational axis of the drum. The filtering screen is composed of a mi crc straining fabric hitherto woven, most commonly, from stainless steel wires although other mi crc straining fabric materials are now beginning to be used. Traditionally, at least in so called GlenfieldMicro Straining Units, the fabric has been woven in standard panel widths and jointed directly to external machined surfaces on the outside of a cylindrical drum using cover straps and sealing tapes fixed in position with screws.This is a skilled and time consuming operation which has, necessarily, to be performed and repeated on the units in situ from time to time in order to effect repairs to tears which can occur in the fabric, mainly due to fatigue failure of the fabric wires at critical points caused by continual flexing of the fabric under the action of the hydraulic forces in use of the units. Since repairs in situ require draining down the tank work, considerable time and effort is involved. In order to mitigate this problem it is proposed in GB A 1 513 373 to have the microstraining fabric sandwiched between multi windowed plates under factory conditions by gluing and subsequently to fit the sandwiched plates to the revolving drum in situ, using screws. Such sandwiched plates however, present 2 considerable reduction in the total area of micro straining fabric exposed for filtering the water. In FR A 1 109 607, a construction of microstraining fabric panel is described having a surrounding frame and protection strips fixed between the panel and the frame to prevent the to and fro flexing of the fabric under the action of the hydraulic forces damaging the strands at the edges of the frame. The present invention a ms to provide an improved micro straining fabric panel which may be manufactured under factory controlled conditions and thereafter readily fitted to the revolving drum of a micro straining unit in situ using relatively unskilled labour, the improvement being directed to reducing the flexing of the fabric in use of the panel due to the hydraulic forces. Broadly speaking, the present invention is a micro straining fabric panel comprising a rigid frame having micro fabric stretched on, and attached to, the frame by means of an uninterrupted band of adhesive. In this manner, an optimum tension may be achieved in the warps and wefts of the micro fabric, to combat fatigue failures due to flexing, and this tension is strictly maintained in the finished panel by the continuous adhesive band. At the same time the panel is readily handled and fitted to a micro straining unit in situ. It is an optional feature of the present invention that the panel is curved in one direction to fit with a cylindrical revolving drum and that the micro fabric is stretched on and adhered to the convex side of the frame. Preferably, in a panel of the present invention, the tension in the warps and wefts of the micro fabrie is selected to tension the wires substantially within their elastic limit, e.g. in the case of the warps, to about one third their breaking strain. Since the warps are straight, or substantially so, the necessary tension is easily determined. In the case of the wefts, there is some suggestion that these tend to straighten under load so that the individual tension of the wires is not so easily determined. Suffice to say that the micro fabric may be stretched on the frame with equal loading in its warp and weft directions. In a panel of the present invention the micro straining fabric is supported under optimum tension to combat fatigue failures and in use of the panel it becomes desirable to ensure that this regime is not substantially interferred with either when attaching the panel to a drum of a micro straining unit or when revolving the drum, which is conveniently driven from one end. To this end, the present invention additionally provides a micro straining unit for water purification comprising a rigid, skeletal, cylindrical drum structure having panels as above defined removably clamped to the outside thereof thereby to form a drum, each panel being clamped all round to sealing surfaces of the drum structure of a shape corresponding to the shape of the surfaces at one side of the frame of the panel. In this fashion, the panels are sealed to the drum structure with intervening sealing strips without distortion, and in as far as the skeletal drum structure is made rigid, the drive to revolve the drum from one end is transmitted through the drum structure without exerting forces on the panel frames tending to distort the panels. In a preferred form, the drum structure comprises spoked rings, one at each end, a plurality of rigid, axially extending drive transmitting members interconnecting the rings, the drive transmitting members being spaced inwardly from the periphery of the drum structure and carrying, outwardly thereof on spacing members, positioned at discrete, spaced apart locations along the drive transmitting members, a windowed, sheetform structure presenting, on the outside thereof, said sea√¨illg su faces of tfle rum structure, said panels being clamped to the sealing surfaces each on an opposite pair of straight sides of the panel, by clamping forces transmitted to the drive transmitting members through further ones of said spacing members. The sheet form structure of the drum allows water to flow through its window openings and through the micro fabric of the panels without churning so that the hydraulic forces are reduced and substantially streamline filtering flow is achieved. Also, in √Öas far as the window openings may be of a size only a little less than that of the panels, substantially the whole of the microfabric of the panels is exposed to direct water flow without impediment. Specific embodiments of micro straining units in accordance with the present invention employing micro straining fabric panels will now be described by way of example, and not by way of limitation, with reference to drawings in which FIG. 1 is a plan view of the frame of a panel in accordance with the present invention FIG. 2 is a cross section of the frame FIG. 3 is a partial cross section on lineA A in Fig. 1 FIG. 4 is a cross section on line B B inFig. 1 and showing the micro fabric FIG 5 is a diagram FIG. 6 is an end view, in part in section, of a micro straining unit according to the present invention FIG. 7 is a front elevation, in part in section, of the unit shown in Fig. 6 and FIGS. 8 to 31 show details of construction of the unit as follows FIG. 8 is a front elevation FIG. 9 is a plan view in Fig. 8 FIG. 10 is an end elevation in Fig. 8 BFIG. 11 is a view of the assembly at A A inFig. 8 FIG. 12 is a flattened plan view showing screw fixing centres FIG. 13 is a plan view of a drive transmitting member FIG 14 shows the detail E in Fig. 15 FIG. 15 is a side view of the member shown in Fig. 13 FIG. 16 is a view on C in Fig. 20 FIG. 17 is a view on B in Fig. 20 FIG. 18 is a view on D in Fig. 21 FIG. 19 is a section of A A in Fig. 18 FIG. 20 shows the cetail at X in Fig. 13 FIG. 21 shows the detail at Y in Fig. 13 FIG. 22 shows a base plate FIG. 23 is a plan view of the base plate FIG. 24 is an enlarged view of the base plate FIG. 25 shows an end circumferential base plate FIG. 26 is a section on A A in Fig. 27 FIG. 27 is a plan view of the end circumferential base plate FIG. 28 shows an intermediate circumferential base plate FIG. 29 is a section on B B in Fig. 30 FIG. 30 is a plan view of the intermediate circumferential base plate and FIG. 31 shows the curvature profile for the end circumferential base plate shown in Fig. 25 and the intermediate circumferential base plate shown in Fig. 28. With reference now to the accompanying drawings and first with reference to Figs. 1 to 5, the frame is composed of two opposite pairs of stainless steel, box sectioned transverse side members 11 of 575 mm in length and longitudinal members 12 of 785 mm in length, two intermediate transverse stainless steel, box sectioned members 13 and a longitudinal, stainless steel rod member 14 passing through bores in the intermediate members 13 and bores in the inner walls of the side members 11 to abut the inside of the outer walls of these members. The box section ends of the side members 12 are left open to drain water from the members, and the members 11 and 13 are provided with vent holes 16 for a similar purpose. The members 11 and 13 are curved to a radius of 1533 mm as indicated in Fig. 5 before welding to the members 12. The welds 18 are finished clean and ground off flush on the top and bottom of the frame and all sharp edges and burrs are removed. The frame is then mounted in a suitable jig not shown and an adhesive applied in a continuous band to the whole of the convex surface of the frame. A piece of stainless steel duplex 18120 and 35 woven wire cloth 15 larger than the frame is then clamped along its four edges and stretched over the convex surface of the frame with the warps of the cloth extending longitudinally of the frame, the fabric being tensioned under a substantial load in its warp and weft directions. The adhesive is then allowed or caused to cure or set.The adhesive penetrates the weave of the cloth and forms a continuous band of adhesive around the frame 11, 11, 12, 12 each sub frame il, 12, 12, 13 and the sub frame 12, 13, 13, 127 so that in effect each wire of the fabric is embedded in, and individually held in tension by, the adnesive band. It is to be understood that any suitable adhesive may be used which will bond stainless steel to stainless steel and at the same time withstand the environmental conditions to be encountered in use of the panel in a micro straining unit and that the adhesive would be cured or caused to set under the manufacturers recommended conditions. The adhesive used in the present example is an anaerobic adhesive manufactured by LocktiteLimited, a British Company. The adhesive has a setting time of about 10 to 15 minutes at ambient temperature. This adhesive has the further advantage that it can be removed from the frames by treating the frames with a hot caustic solution which enables frames to be recovered. Instead of pre curving the members 11, 13 the frame may be welded up using straight members 11, 13 to form the frame, and the fabric 15 is attached to one side of the frame using adhesive, all as previously described. The frame members 1, 13 are then bent to the required curvature so further tens√¨oning the fabric wefts to a small degree, the tensioned fabric still being stretched on the convex side of the frame. The invention may be applied to the production of micro strain√¨ng panels comprising, instead, a polyester fabric using a suitable adhesive. With reference to the Figs 6 to 31, the microstraining unit comprises a revolving drum 30 into which water to be strained or purified is caused to flow at one open end 31 of the drum, the water then passing through a fabric filtering screen 33 cladding the periphery of the drum to the outside of the drum 30 and composed of sixty four framed panels 49 of the fabric as described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5The screen is continuously washed clean of suspended solids, organisms and other materials filtered out by the screen by means of water Jets or water sprays 35 directed onto the outside of the screen 33 at the top of the drum 30 above the free surface 40 of the flow, the solids and other materials washed off the screen being collected by the hoppers 41 inside the rotating drum, the hoppers exhausting continuously through a stationary pipe 43 arranged along the rotational axis 44 of the drum. Each panel 49 has its longitudinal frame side members 12 disposed axially of the drum and its curved frame side members 11 disposed circumferentially of the drum. The drum 30 comprises a pair of spoked rings 5Q, one at each end, sixteen rigid, axially extending, round sectioned, drive transmitting tubular members 51 interconnecting the rings 50 and a windowed, sheetform structure 53 to the outside of which the panels 49 are removably clamped by clamping means later to be described. The drum is driven from one end via a pinion 55 which engages with a toothed gear wheel 56 carried by the spoked ring 50 at the water inlet end of the drum. The members 51 have welded on, drum support, end securing members 58 seen in Figs. 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 20 bolted to the spoked rings 58, each by a pair of bolts 60. These members comprise platform plates 61 to which are bolted longitudinal and end circumferential base plates 64 and 65.The members 51 further have three welded on drum support, intermediate securing members 66 seen in Figs. 13, 15, 18, 19 and 21 comprising platform plates 67 to which are bolted longitudinal and intermediate circumferential base plates 64 and 70. The members 51 still further have, between each adjacent pair of drum support securing members, three spaced apart, welded on clamping studs 72 seen in Figs. 13, 14 and 15, carrying drum support platform blocks 73 for supporting longitudinal base plates 64, the studs 72 forming parts of the clamping means for the panels 49 hereinbefore referred to. The end circumferential base plates 65 are also bolted along their length to the spoked rings 58, as at 76 see Figs. 12 and 27 . The end circumferential base plates have welded on clamping studs 77 positioned half way along their length. The intermediate circumferential base plates 70 likewise have welded on clamping studs 78 positioned half way along their length. The The end circumferential base plates 65 and the intermediate circumferential base plates are rolled to the radius of the inner surface of the side members 11 of the panels 49. The longitudinal and circumferential base plates together form the windowed, sheet form structure 53 having window openings 80 see Fig 8 corresponding in number to the number of panels 49 the window openings 80 being of a size only a little less than that of the panels 49 and the inner surfaces of the side members 11 and 12 of the panels 49 being clamped to the sheet form structure 53 with the intervention of flat sealing strips 82 see for example Fig. 14 , one panel covering over each window opening 80. The panels are removably clamped in position with T and inverted L sectioned clamping members 84 and 85 which arL positioned on the studs 72 and 78 and the studs 76 respectively, and clamping nuts 90 screwed onto the studs. In as fai as the widowed, outer surface of the sheet form structure 53 is right cylindrical and conformed accurately to the curvature of the panels, the panels are clamped to the structure 53 without distortion which might otherwise alter the predetermined tensioning of the fabric of the panels.Furthermore, the straight sides of the panels are clamped to the members 51 and the rigid frames of the panels are, therefore, rigidly supported from the drive members each along two opposite sides, so that the windowed sheet form structure 53 is largely relieved of water forces applied to the panels. Also, the drive to the drum structure at the gear wheel 56 is transmitted through the drum structure by the members 51 and the windowed sheet form structure 53 is relieved of the driving forces which might otherwise tend to distort the panels. Accordingly, the micro straining fabric of the panels is maintained under even, predetermined tension in use of the unit as desired. The members 51 being of round section are of streamline shape and tend to move smoothly through the water as the drum structure is revolved. Water is free to flow between the members 51 and the sheet form structure 53 so that churning of the water at the inside face of the filtering fabric of the panels is avoided, the hydraulic forces are reduced and filterinr flow is improved. By removing its clamping nuts 90 and clamping members 84, 85 or 84 any panel 49 may readily be removed and replaced from the outside of the drum structure without draining down the water, and this may be achieved with semi skilled labour. By increasing or reducing the number of rings of intermediate circumferential base plates 70 and fittings therefor, the drum 32 ray be lert rene or shortened whilst still using standard sized panels 49 covering the window openings 80. The structure described is, therefore, adaptable to sw straining units of different sizes and to convert existing units using parts as detailde in Figs. 8 to 31 of the accompanying drawings. The panels may readily be replaced in situ without draining down the micro straining unit and with relatively unskilled lebour. The panels 49 as described with reference toFigs. 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings have their fabric wires substantially uniformly tensioned within their elastic limit in a uniform, part cylindrical surface under a high degree of permanent tension which significantly reduces the flexing of the fabric and improves the fatigue life of the individual wires in use of the panels and, therefore, the life of the fabric. In the specific example described the fabric is tensioned in its warp and weft directions under a load of 10 to 25 Newtons per cm. By evenly tensioning the strands of the fabric, the filtering flow is improved.
