At the time being a bicycle training apparatus is known, as set forth in U.K. Patent Application G. B. 2,026,876 A filed March 9, 1979, claiming the priority of Italian Utility Model ApplicationNo. 60925B 78 and entitled Bicycle training apparatus . Such a device realizes a considerable progress in the field of bicycle apparatus because it is capable of being used with a wide range of bicycles of differing shapes and sizes. The apparatus according to this patent application is collapsible but . there are some difficulties to assemble it and, when collapsed to a reduced size, it could not be easily disposed.Moreover, the apparatus of UK patent application 2,026,876 required small disassembling and assembling which, even if easy, could provide a support on the user laziness providing a mind justification of a delay of training. Tn fact, sport training represents a tribute of suffering in view of health and of being quite fit. Such apparatus should be always and everywhere available so as to provide potential users, kept away from gymnasiums and roads by present day trend engagements. An object of the present invention is to provide a form of bicycle training apparatus wherein the aforementioned disadvantages are obviated and which incorporates means enabling it to be available everywhere, at any time, by any user, with any bicycle. With this object in view, the present invention provides bicycle training apparatus of the kind adapted to receive and form a stationary mounting for bicycle, which can then be ridden under condition simulating road use, which is quickly and easily collapsible and disposable in a bag of reduced size which is adapted to be carried by the user and follow him anywhere. In the apparatus of the invention to obtain such semplifications comprise the provision of an extending hinged member connectable to the frame in at least two positions a first extended position, suitable to receive the forward wheel tire and a second collapsed position wherein the extending member is folded and connected flat with the flat structure. The road simulating means is provided by a single drum and the brake control comprises a wheel bolt, placed at the top of an arcuated hollow member, whose level, as that of uprights, supporting the bicycle rear wheel axle, i.e., the whole bicycle, may be adjusted in accordance with the user needs. Also the uprights may be swung flat, simply by lowering them upon releasing two butterfly bolts.The wheel bolt, placed at the top of the arcuated hollow member, easily adjustable by the user provide a remote control, whereby the user may adjust the braking power of the road simulating drum. However, an important object of the invention is to provide an apparatus characterized in that it provides an organic unit of the weight of about kg. 7 which, in collapsed condition, may be placed in a bag which is disposable in a bag, extending more in lenght and height than in thickness, substantially shaped as a prism 21 cm. height or thick, with ends in the shape of isosceles trapezoid 52 cm height and 30 cm and 58 cn length parallel sides. The bag being provided with a pair of big handles merging from top sides of trapezoid and comprising a single closed band.

Figure 3 shows the bicycle training apparatus, taken off from the bag and illustrating a first step in the mounting of same. Figure 4 shows a bicycle training apparatus, according to the present invention, ready for mounting of the bicycle on the apparatus. Figure 5 is a fragmentary perspective view of bicycle training apparatus, according to the present invention, in slightly enlarged scale taken from the bottom to show details not shown inFigures 1, 2, 3 and 4. Figure 6 is a back view, in an enlarged scale, or a bicycle training apparatus, according to the present invention, with a racing cycle 0 mounted, in its suitable position, on the apparatus sed in use, only the rear part of the bicycle being shown. The illustrated embodiment of the bicycle training apparatus according to the present invertion, comprises a generally triangular lattide base frame 1, preferably hollow which at an angle 10 is provided with a square cross sectioned joint member 12. To said triangular lattice frame, which is supported by three short lets 20, 21, 22, each provided with an antislip shoe 20 , 21 , 22 , the carrying and operating members, are connected. In fact, joint 12 may receive a back bone 3, comprising two sections 30 and 31 and an elbow 32 with hinges 32 , 32 .The outward end of back bone section 31 is provided with a bottom short leg 23 with a shoe 23 and with an upper lengthwise locator or receiver in the form of a channel member 33 to carry the tire of bicycle Q forward wheel not shown .Fr ame 1 is characterized by pair of lengthwise parallel members 13, 13 . Frame sections 13, 13 are provided, at a short distance from frame back side 11, with a U shaped bracket 4, comprising a base section 40 and two uprights sections 41, 42 each in the fotm of an angle member. Each uprights, in the form of an angle member, has ole side 41 , 42 parallel to frame side 11 and the other side 41 , 42 parallel to lengthwise 13, 13 . The upper ends of uprights 41 and 42, i.e. of sides 41 , 42 of same, are provided with a seat 141, 142 in the form of a saddle to be described in the following. Also on sides 41 , 42 of uprights 41 and 42, at a level of sections 13, 13 , each upright is provided with a hole 241, 242 to receive a bolt 51, 52 with a butterfly nut.Each upright 41, 42 may be coupled, by said bolts 51 and 52 and nuts 51 and 52 , as well as by bolts 151 and 152 and nuts 51 and 152 , to a pillar 6 and 7 which are complementary each other, as explained in the following. The upper end of pillar 6 is provided with a socket 60, whose hollow space receives, at one end 60 , a butterfly bolt 61 62 and at the other end 60 with a bush 63 of which it will be spoken in the following. Connected with socket 60 there is another vertical socket 69, square in cross section, which receives a sliding rod 68, which may be fastened by a butterfly bolt 69 . Such rod is hollow and receives a cable 8, to be spoken with in the following and the upper end of sliding rod 68 is provided with a knob 80 of which it will be spoken in the following. The second pillar 70 is U shaped, comprising two uprights 71 and 72. The upright 72, is provided therethrough with a threaded 72 hole of which it will be spoken in the following and the upright 71 is provided with a saddle seat 71, which is substantially coaxial with hole 72 . In the threaded hole 72 is mounted a butterfly bolt 74 . The bolt free end 74, is idle connected with a pressing member 73.In fact, on the free end 74 of screw 74, there is a groove 73 receiving the inner flange edge 73 of pressing member 73. Pressing member 73 is in the form of a bush which is provided with forward sockets 173. In other words, pressing member or bush 73 is shaped and sized so as to receive therein any nut 01 such as a poligonal nut, armed nut 01 , butterfly nut or the like, of any bicycle rear axle 00. Since pressing member or bush 73 receives, in its hollow and sockets 173, the whole nut 01, its flat forward surface 173 may engage the surface 07 of the rear axle bracket 07 of bicycle 0. Thus, bracket 07 is urged toward the bicycle wheel 02 but, since the rear surface 07 of bracket 07 is engaged by the arms 271 of upright 71, the rear axle bracket 07 of bicycle 0 is strongly fastened to the apparatus.In a like manner operates, at the other end of axle end, the pressing member or bush 63 which, however, simply engages the outer surface of bracket 06.It will be appreciated that the fastening power, provided by pressing member or bush 73, is more effective in fastening the bicycle 0 to the apparatLts due to the thorough reaction provided by the rear surface of the same bracket member. Whereas, the pressing member or bush 63, engaging the power accepting surface of the other axle bracket o6 of bicycle 0, provides only a vertical support to receive, therein in its hollow space, the nut 09i while the axial power applied by bush 63 on power accepting surface is not corqresiond ly confronted by a direct reaction power and such reaction occurs. Reference will now be made to those apparatus members simulating the road, comprising a road simulating roller which povide a bicycle support and a braking means 5 to simulate different road gradients and or conditions. Brake means 5 comprise a plunger 50, connected for swinging movement about fulcrum 510 in the form of a first class lever whose effort 520 is driven by one end 58 of operating cable 8 which is slidably mounted through sheating 8, wherein the other end 8 of cable 8 is connected to a bush 81 with a threaded hole 81 , which receives a wheeled bolt 80. Bush 81 is provided with a radial rod 81 engaging the lengthwise opening 86 of hollow upright 68. It is thus self explaining how, clockwise and anticlockwise rotating the wheel bolt 80, the brake means may be suitably adjusted in accordance with user needs. It will be appreciated that the collapsed apparatus may be disposed in a bag 9 extending more in length and height than in thickness, substantially shaped as a prism 21 cm height or thick, with ends in the shape of isosceles trapezoid 52 cm height and parallel sides 30 cn and 58 Cm length. Bag 9 is provided with a pair of big handles 90, merging from short top sides bn of trapezoid and comprising a single closed band 90 . Bag 9 is provided with a slip fastener 91, extending along tree sides so that it may be opened substantially flat see figure 2 . It will be appreciated that, as shown in figures 1 and 2 the apparatus may be collapsed to a substantially flat shape thus providing a sustantially flat shape of the bag too. Once that the apparatus is taken off from the bag it is in the conditions, as shown in figure 2, of course aside of the latter.As shown at figure 3 the first steps to be taken are to rise uprights 6 and 7, as well as extracting backbone 3 completely from joint 12 and remounting it after an anticlockwise rotation of a right angle, whereby to place leg 23 parallel to leg 22, i.e., in vertical fashion and whereby channel member 33 is topwise open see figure 4 . It will be appreciated that uprights 6 and 7 are simply swung up and bolts 151 and 152 set in seats 141 and 142 and this is particularly easy since uprights 6 and 7 are provided with lengthwise opening theretrough. Thereupon the butterfly nut 151 and 152 are fastened. The apparatus is now ready to install thereon one of a wide range of bicycles, e.g. O. Of course some apparatus members are to be adjusted and adapted to the bicycle, particularly setting butterfly nut and bolt 151 , 152 , 62, 74 , and 69 , as well as adjusting the position of channel member 33. It will be appreciated there is no need for making any physical adaptations or modifications, even of a temporary nature, to the bicycle itself. It is to be understood that the foregoing description serves only to illustrate one form the apparatus can take, and that variations may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.
