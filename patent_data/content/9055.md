## Description
VINYL ESTER RESIN COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING DICYCLOPENTADIENE ALKENOATE This invention is directed to a thermosetting resin composition comprising from 80 to 30 percent by weight of a terminally unsaturated vinyl ester resin and from 20 to 70 percent by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer characterized in that the ethylenically unsaturated monomer comprises from 5 to 90 percent by weight of a dicyclopentadiene alkenoate and from 95 to 10 percent by weight of a vinyl aromatic monomer. The use of the dicyclopentadiene alkenoate surprisingly accelerates the rate at which hardness of the resin develops during room temperature cure. The thermosettable resin composition is useful to make laminates, molded articles and coatings. Vinyl ester resins having terminal unsaturation are well known in the art. These resins are prepared by reacting a polyepoxide resin with an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. As such, these vinyl ester resins have in their structural formula a group having the formulaEMI1.1 Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids include, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, cinnamic acid, and dicarboxylic acrd half esters of hydroxyalkyl acrylates. Any of the known polyepoxides may be used which includes, for example, glycidyl polyethers of polyhydric phenols and polyhydric alcohols, and epoxy novolacs. Preferred polyepoxides are the bisphenol based resins and epoxy novolac resins having epoxide equivalent weights from 150 to 1000. Also included in the definition of vinyl ester resins used herein are resins in which the secondary hydroxyl group produced when the epoxy group reacts with the carboxylic acid group is post reacted with a dicarboxylic acid anhydride to form pendant half ester groups.Vinyl ester resins useful in this invention may also be modified by reactions with isocyanates, other anhydrides, and other reagents reactive with the secondary hydroxyl group. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomers copolymerizable with the vinyl ester resin comprises vinyl aromatic monomers such as, for example, styrene, methyl styrene, chlorostyrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene and diallyl phthalate. Preferably, the vinyl ester resin with the ethylenically unsaturated monomer contains from 30 to 50 percent by weight of the monomer based on the combined weight of the vinyl ester resin and the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. A small amount of an inhibitor such as, for example, tertiary butyl catechol is added to this mixture. The amount added is generally in the range of from 50 to 300 parts per million based upon the amount of vinyl aromatic monomer. The dicyclopentadiene alkenoate employed in this invention is preferably prepared in an acid catalyzed reaction of a commercial C10 hydrocarbon stream containing at least 50 percent by weight dicyclopentadiene with a monocarbaxylic afknoic acid. The process is known from British Patent 1,114,585. Useful monocarboxylic alkenoic acids have 3 to 5 carbon atoms, such as, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, angelic acid, tiglic acid and mixtures thereof. Preferably the alkenoic acid is acrylic acid. This invention is also directed to cured fibrous laminates prepared from thermosetting resin compositions described hereinbefore. The laminates are prepared by first adding free radical forming catalysts to the thermosetting resin composition and then adding the mixture to a suitable fibrous reinforcement such as, for example, asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, fibrous glass, or inorganic fibers. When fibrous glass is used, it can be employed in any form such as, for example, chopped strands, filaments, ribbons, yarns, or reinforcing mats. Examples of suitable catalysts include benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl peroxide, and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide Accelerators are frequently used such as, for example, cobalt naphthenate and dimethyl aniline.The thermosetting resin composition containing catalyst and optionally an accelerator is rolled, sprayed or impregnated into the fibrous reinforcement and then cured in a manner well known in the art.Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Run A A thermosetting resin composition was prepared inExamples 1 and 2 by blending a commercially available vinyl ester resin with dicyclopentadiene acrylate and styrene.In Comparative Run A, the vinyl ester resin was only blended with styrene. The vinyl ester resin was prepared by combining the following proportions of reactants A polyepoxide resin was prepared first by reacting three parts by weight of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with one part by weight of bisphenol A, after which 1.45 parts of. the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A was blended therewith. The polyepoxide mixture so produced was reacted with 1.15 parts by weight of methacrylic acid. When the acid content is reduced to less than 3 percent by weight, the polyepoxide methacrylic acid product was reacted with 0.2 parts by weight of maleic anhydride. The dicyclopentadiene acrylate DCPD A was prepared by reacting one mole of acrylic acid with one mole of dicyclopentadiene in the presence of a BF3 catalyst. Glass laminates containing 25 percent by weight random fiber glass mats were prepared using the above resin compositions. Two fiber glass mats and a hand roller technique were used to make a sheet 1 8 inch 3 mm thick and 12 inches by 14 inches 30 cm by 36 cm in dimensions for each blend. Catalysts were added to each resin blend so that the gel time was between 15 and 18 minutes. The Barcol hardness development data illustrates that the hardness development is significantly more rapid for the laminates employing the resin compositions of Examples 1 and 2 than for Comparative Run A, and the end value is higher.
