# RECEIVER FOR ANALYZING INCOMING SIGNALS

## Abstract
In a receiving circuit a control circuit 30 and a direction finding circuit 40 generate a digitally encoded descriptor which characterises pulses of r.f. radiation received in a particular azimuthal direction and having a particular carrier frequency. The descriptor may be compared with data stored in a processing circuit 50 representing r.f. pulses emitted by sources which have already been detected or which are known to exist. To reduce the workload on processing circuit 50 a number of emulator circuits 41 generate pulse patterns which simulate pulses produced by known sources of little inherent interest. If the received pulses match the simulated pulses a gate 18 inhibits control circuit 30 .
