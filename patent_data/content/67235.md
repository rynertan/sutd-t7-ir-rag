# INDUCTION HEAT COOKING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
In an induction heat cooking apparatus for induction heating a metallic article to be heated, a plurality of induction heating coils 9 are arranged in a line and an inlet 4 for taking in cooling air to cool the interior of the cooking apparatus and an outlet 5 for exhausting the air are provided at the front face and at the rear face of the cooking apparatus respectively. This makes it possible to cook comfortably as no exhausted hot air blows up onto the cooker and possible to cool effectively as no hot air exhausted from the article to be heated is taken in. In addition, a partition 10 is provided for separating the electric power converting unit and the operating section of the induction heat cooking apparatus and a cooling fan 12 is provided in the opening 10a of the partition 10 . It is thus possible to cook effectively as no cooling air circulates back into the cooking apparatus and to prevent a noise mulfunc tion caused by the operating section being exposed to the induction radiation from the electric power converting circuit.
