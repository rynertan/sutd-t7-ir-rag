# Process for producing ethylene copolymer by gaseous phase polymerization.

## Abstract
A process for producing an ethylene copolymer com prises polymerizing a predominant amount of ethylene and a minor amount of an alpha olefin having 4 to 10 carbon atoms in the gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a transition metal catalyst component and B an orga nometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the period ic table, wherein i at least 1 mole, per mole of ethylene, of a gaseous sat urated hydrocarbon having 3 to 6 carbon atoms is present in the gaseous phase copolymerization system, and ii the gaseous mixture containing the unreacted olefin which has been discharged from the gaseous phase copoly merization system is cooled to a temperature at which the mix ture is not liquefied, and the cooled gaseous mixture is recy cled to the gaseous phase copolymerization system.
