# Eye movement recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for recording eye movement. A light source has its rays directed toward the eye of a subject and a glass dome 35 secured to spectacle frames worn by the subject. The primary and secondary glints reflected off the glass 35 and eye cornea, respectively, are transmitted via mirrors 36, 37, 38, 41 , lenses 39 and a fiber optic image guide 25 to a video camera tube 26 . The position of the glints on an XY axis is electronically determined and the information is fed to a computer which compares the data from the two glints and compensates for the head movement which corresponds to movement of the primary glint.
