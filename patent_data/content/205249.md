# Vehicle brake pressure proportioning valve.

## Abstract
Housing 4 has a master cylinder hydraulic pressure inlet 12, a rear brake pressure outlet 14, and a stepped bore 6 with narrow and wide parts 8 and 10 containing stepped plunger 16 loaded by spring 24 and consisting of narrow and wide plun ger parts 18 and 20. The plunger has a small and large end faces 40 and 42, and a bore 26, 28 containing rod 30, plunger 34 and spring 38. Fluid flow is through grooves between ribs 32 on the rod and through passage 36. A valve is formed by light spring 44 urging ball 46 towards seat 48 about plunger bore 26. Initially brake pressure Pb increases by the same amount as the master cylinder pressure Pi increases. On the pressure Pi and Pb reaching a pre determined value at which the effect of the brake pressure Pb on end face 42 overcomes both the spring 24 and the effect of Pi on end face 40 and so the plunger 16 shuttles leftwards relatively to rod 30 and ball 46 until the ball abuts seat 48 to block bore 26, 28. On pressure Pi continuing increasing, its effect on face 40 supplemented by spring 24 overcomes the pressure effect on face 42, and the plunger shuttles rightwards allowing valve 46, 48 to open. Therefore brake pressure Pb starts to increase again until its effect on face 42 causes the plunger 16 to shuttle leftwards again. This left right shuttling of the plunger allows brake pressure Pb to rise but now only as a proportion of pressure Pi. Eventually another pre determined value of pressure Pi is reached at which its effect on an effective area X of ball 46 where X equals the cross section of bore 26 is enough to hold the ball 46 on the seat 48 and compress the spring 38 as the plunger moves rightwards. Now brake pressure Pb cannot be increased any further.
