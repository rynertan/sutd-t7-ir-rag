# A device for preventing the accumulation of fibres in an open end spinning frame.

## Abstract
An open end spinning frame comprises a fiber feeding mechanism, constructed with a feed roller 2 and a presser 3 urged towards the feed roller 2 , a combing roller 4 having a metallic wire 6 wound therearound, a rotor for spinning the fibers delivered from the combing roller 4 , and a pair of flat side plates. The feeding mechanism is provided with a pas sage for flowing air circuit, which passage is formed by chamfering the side of the presser 3 , by shortening the width of the feed roller 2 or by forming only one project at the front end of the presser. Through the air current flowing pas sage, one or more flow in air currents A, B, C flow so that the accumulation of fibers does not occur easily.
