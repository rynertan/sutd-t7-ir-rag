# Improved distillation process.

## Abstract
A method for improving the separation of a feed into a distillate and a bottoms product is disclosed. The subject invention includes a first distillation zone 20 and a second distillation zone 30 , each having rectification zones 22, 32 and stripping zones 24, 34 . Bottoms from the first stripping zone 24 are passed into the second distillation zone 30 . Distillate from the second rectification zone 32 is removed utilizing a fluid evacuation means 40 and returned to the first stripping zone 24 . Preferably, the fluid evacuation means 40 is a steam ejector.
