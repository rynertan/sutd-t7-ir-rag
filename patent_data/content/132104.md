# Heat resistant phenolic resin foams.

## Abstract
A heat resistant phenolic resin foam contains a hydrate of an inorganic compound which generates a water vapor at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the phenolic resin foam. The hydrate is chosen such that a satu rated aqueous solution thereof has a pH of not more than 8, e.g., MgSO₄.4H₂0, Na₂SO₄.10H₂0, ZnSO₄.7H₂0, N aAl SO₄ ₂.12H₂0, Mg₃ PO₄ ₂.8H₂0, Al₂.9Si0₂.13H₂0, KAl SO₄ ₂.12H₂0 and Al₂ SO₄ ₃.14 18H₂0 and is contained in the foam in an amount of 2 to 30 by weight.
