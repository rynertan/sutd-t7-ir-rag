# Package for use in preserving apples or the like.

## Abstract
A process is described for preserving apples, together with an apple case for use in the process. A bag for receiving one or more apples is provided, and an ethylene absorbent and a deoxidant are placed in the bag, each of the absorbent and the deoxidant being in an amount such that ethylene biosynthesis is suppressed for keeping freshness of the apple while the apple is within the bag. Each apple is placed within the bag which is then sealed to contain the apples, the ethylene absorbent and the deoxidant. The sealed bag allow air to permeate through it to a degree such that minimum amount of air necessary for the or each apple is available in the presence of the ethylene absorbent and the deoxidant. Apples may thus be stored in the sealed bag whereby ripening of the apples is delayed to maintain their freshness.
