# Bib having segmented neck aperture perimetric edge.

## Abstract
A bib 20 having a neck accommodating aperture defined by a segmented perimetric edge ie, a segmented neck aperture perimeter. The neck accommodating aperture 43 is generally oval shape and the sheet material from which the bib is constructed has a plurality of bifurcations such as slits 28 or notches which extend generally radially outwardly from the perimetric edge of the neck accommodating aperture. Each pair of adjacent bifurcations define a portion of bib material which is attached to the parent bib material along only a proximal end defining line and which portion is designated a petal. The petals 27 are radially conformable to a range of neck sizes and will, due to inherent resilience of the bib ma terial maintain a comfortable fit even during infant neck con tortions. In an exemplary embodiment, the distal end portions of such petals 27 are doubled under and have their distal ends secured adjacent their proximal ends, to obviate raw cut edges of such portions from contacting users necks.
