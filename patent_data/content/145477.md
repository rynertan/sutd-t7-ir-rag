# Digital image processing.

## Abstract
A system and method for porcessing digital representations of images by routing the representations sequentially through a plurality of stages. Each stage includes a delay 112 for delaying one of two inputs and a function unit 114 for performing logical operations on the delayed and undelayed signals to produce two outputs. The logic unit performs any one of a plurality of logic functions as dynamically selected S1SF, S1PF during processing. Specific functions of particular interest include 1 ORing the delayed signaland the original digital signal and 2 ANDing the delayed signal and the original digital signal. The delay includes a first shift register 130 through which the serial signal is shifted, a storage device 136 for storing signal segments read from the first shift register, and a second shift register 140 into which the segments are returned from storage to be re serialized to produce the delayed signal.
