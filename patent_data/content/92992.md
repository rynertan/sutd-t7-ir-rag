# Pressure transmitting medium and method for utilizing same to densify material.

## Abstract
A quantity of material 10 , which is at less than a predetermined density, is disposed within a sealed container 12 which is, in turn, encapsulated in a pressure transmitting 18 medium which is, in turn, placed within a pot die 20 of a press where it is restrained as a ram 24 enters the pot die 20 and applies a force to the pressure transmitting medium 18 to densify the material within the container into a compact 10 of predetermined density. The pressure transmitting medium 18 is characterized by a rigid intercon nected ceramic skeleton structure 26 which is collapsible in response to a predetermined force and fluidizing glass 28 capable of fluidity and supported by and retained within the skeleton structure 26 . The glass 28 becomes fluidic and capable of plastic flow at temperatures utilized for compac tion whereas the ceramic skeleton 26 retains its configura tion and acts as a carrier for the fluidic glass 28 . As external pressure is applied by coaction between the pot die 20 and ram 24 , the ceramic skeleton structure 26 collapses to produce a composite 18 of ceramic skeleton structure fragments 26 dispersed in the fluidizing glass 28 with the composite 18 being substantially fully dense and incom pressible and rendered fluidic and capable of plastic flow at the predetermined densification of the material being com pacted within the container. Accordingly, the ceramic skele ton structure 26 is dominant to provide structural rigidity and encapsulation and retainment of the fluidic glass 28 until the skeleton structure 26 is collapsed under ram 24 force, at which time the fluidic glass 28 becomes dominant to provide omnidirectional pressure transmission to effect the predetermined densification of the material being com pacted within the container 12 .
