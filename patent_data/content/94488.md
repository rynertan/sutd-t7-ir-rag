# Separation of regenerated catalyst from combustion products.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for separating regenerated catalyst from gaseous combustion products within a re generator. The apparatus comprises a downcomer within the regenerator vessel through which the catalyst and gaseous combustion products flow. Means are provided at the lower end of the downcomer for utilizing the momentum of the catalyst particles to separate them from the gaseous com bustion products.
