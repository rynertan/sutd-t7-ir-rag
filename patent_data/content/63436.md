# Zeolites.

## Abstract
A synthetic zeolite material, designated zeolite EU 4, having a molar composition expressed by the formula O to M₂O aY₂O₃ at least 100 XO₂ 0 to 35 H₂O wherein M is a monovalent cation or 1 n of a cation of valency n, a is from 0 to 9, X is a silicon and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic, antimony, manganese, gallium or boron, and H₂O is water of hydration additional to water notionally present when M is H, and having a defined X ray diffraction pattern is prepared from an aqueous reaction mixture containing the oxide XO₂, optionally the oxide Y₂O₃ and an alkyltrimethylammonium or dialkyldimethylammo nium compound. Zeolite EU 4 is a useful catalyst for methanol conversion and the like.
