# A method of detecting addressing errors in a catalogued memory, and catalogued memory using same.

## Abstract
A redundant error detecting addressing method and system for use in a cache memory. A directory converts logical data addresses to physical addresses in the cache where the data is stored in blocks. The blocks are expanded to include redundant addressing information such as the logical data address and the physical cache address. When a block is accessed from the cache, the redundant addressing is compared to the directory addressing information to confirm that the correct data has been accessed.
