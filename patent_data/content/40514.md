# Improved particulate coal in liquid mixture and process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
Improved particulate coal in liquid mixtures and a pro cess for the production thereof wherein, prior to mixing with liquid, the coal component of the mixture if finely divided in a substantially airtight fluid energy attrition mill 11 , and there after separated in a separator 17 from ash particles. The particulate coal product thus produced is mixed with a suit able liquid in a vessel 19 to provide a product which may be used in coal gasification or hydrogenation processes, or as a composite fuel, and which can be stored for extended periods without appreciable settling out of the coal from the mixture.
