# Colouring of fruit.

## Abstract
A process for artificially colouring fruit characterised in that an aqueous medium containing the fruit is treated with a colourant and a hydrolysable tannin at an adequate tem perature until the desired quantities of colourant and hyd rolysable tannin are absorbed by the fruit, the pH is lowered at least to a value at which the colourant becomes substanti ally insoluble, after which the pH is raised gradually while ensuring that the pH of the inner parts of the fruit does not exceed 7 and finally the fruit is separated from the aqueous medium.
