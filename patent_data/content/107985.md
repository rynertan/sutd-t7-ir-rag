# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium is described which comprises, on a support, a magnetic layer containing ferromagnetic powder, said ferromagnetic powder compris ing ferromagnetic metallic particles of the average grain size not more than 0.5Âµ, the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis acicular ratio thereof being from 0.3 to 4.5, and the coercive force thereof being from 1350 Oe to 1600 Oe.
