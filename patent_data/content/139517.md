# Improvements in or relating to diamond heatsink assemblies.

## Abstract
A diamond heatsink assemby comprises a multifaceted diamond mounted on a metal heatsink. The diamond may be partially embedded in the metal heatsink by pressing, soldering or clamping or the metal heatsink may comprise a split collet arrangement so that the diamond is removable. An electronic component such as a mullimetric or a mic rometric wave device can be mounted on one or several facets, and a faulty component can be removed and a new one secured to the same or another facet.
