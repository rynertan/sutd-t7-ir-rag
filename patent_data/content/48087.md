# Hydraulic master cylinder.

## Abstract
A hydraulic master cylinder has pistons 16 displacable along the pivot axis of a brake pedal 13 to apply the vehicle brakes. Motion between the pedal 13 and the pistons 16 is transmitted by balls 19 located in a respective arcuate track formed partly in the pedal 13 and partly in the respective piston 16 . The master cylinder is particularly suitable for dual circuit brake systems. A master cylinder having a single piston is also disclosed.
