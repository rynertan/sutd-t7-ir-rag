# Light tight cassette.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a light tight cassette 1 suitable for holding a roll of web like light sensitive photo graphic material 2 wound around a core 6 and for dis pensing said photographic material through a slit 19 provided in the cassette. The cassette of the invention is substantially in the form of a box comprising a shell portion 3 whose wall is at least partly and locally realized as a double wall and two end closure walls 4, 5 which are secured to said shell portion 3 by means 42, 46 43, 47 44, 48 and 45, 49 provided in the outer wall of the double wall portions of said shell and in said end closure walls respectively. By incorporating the locking means of the shell portion cooperating with the locking means of the end closure walls within the outer wall of the double wall portions of the shell the inner wall of the double wall portions of the shell prevents light from falling into the cassette through the locking means and makes the cassette perfectly light tight.
