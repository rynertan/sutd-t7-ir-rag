## Description
HOMOCARNOSINE OR ACYLHOMOCARNOSINE SALTS This invention relates to a new homocarnosine or acyihomocarnosine zinc or aluminum salt. More particularly, this invention relates to a homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine aluminum or zinc salt of the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group M represents a zinc atom or an aluminum atom a denotes 1, 2 or 3 and b denotes 0, 1 or 2 provided that when a denotes 1, b denotes 0 and M represents zinc, a hydrogen atom is omitted from the homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine residue. These new compounds tll have excellent antiulcer and wound healing promoting actions. The conventional drug therapy for peptic ulcer involves administration of antacids having gastric mucosa protecting and tissue repairing actions, bismuth drugs, aluminum preparations, L glutamine preparations, etc. However, these drugs generally have the disadvantage that they are not sufficiently effective, although the side effects they induce are relatively mild. Recently, with an increasing incidence of peptic ulcer, various studies on therapeutic drugs for the disease have been undertaken and particularly as the mechanism of onset of peptic ulcer has been made increasingly clear, therapeutic drugs antagonizing the ulcer such as histamine H2 receptor antagonists, gastrin antagonists and autonomic nerve blocking agents have been studied in detail. Actually, some drugs developed along these lines have already been on the market. However, while these antagonists and blockers are generally potent, they produce severe and diverse side effects, thus presenting various problems from the standpoint of drug safety. Further, in the field of dermatological drugs for external use, there is the axiom that spontaneous healing cannot be accelerated and, for this reason, little study has been undertaken on the action of drugs to promote spontaneous healing of wounds. In view of the above drawbacks and problems, the present inventor conducted an intensive study to develop a drug which would protect the gastric mucosa and repair the damaged tissue, cause little side effect, produce remarkable therapeutic effects and be useful as a therapeutic agent for peptic ulcer or and an agent for promoting the spontaneous healing of wounds. As a candidate drug, the present inventor paid attention to homocarnosine, a compound which had not been much studied so far, and its acyl derivatives but these compounds as such were found to be inadequate in therapeutic action on peptic ulcer or in the action to promote spontaneous healing of wounds and do not warrant development as drugs. In an attempt to overcome the above mentioned problems, the present inventor synthesized a large number of derivatives of homocarnosine and investigated their therapeutic activity and other properties. As a result, it was found that the zinc or aluminum salts of homocarnosine and acylhomocarnosines which may be represented by the above general formula 11 produce excellent therapeutic effects against peptic ulcer and also possess high activity to promote spontaneous healing of wounds and that they cause only mild side effects. Thus, it was found that the above mentioned problems can be overcome by converting homocarnosine or an acylhomocarnosine into the corresponding zinc or aluminum salt. This invention has been predicated on the above finding. This invention is, therefore, directed to a homocarnosine salt of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group M represents a zinc atom or an aluminum atom a denotes 1, 2 or 3t and b denotes 0, 1 or 2, provided that when a denotes 1, b denotes 0 and M represents zinc, a hydrogen atom is omitted from the homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine residue. The homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine zinc salt according to this invention can be produced easily and in quantitative yield by reacting homocarnosine or an acylhomocarnosine with a zinc compound such as a zinc halide, zinc sulfate or zinc hydroxide in the presence or absence of a basic agent such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or a sodium alkoxide in a hydrophilic or hydrophobic solvent, water, or a mixture of water and such a solvent.In a homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine zinc salt, it is considered that the homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine molecule is usually combined with zinc atom in the state of lacking 2 hydrogen atoms of the molecule. The homocarnosine or acylhomocarnosine aluminum salt can also be produced in quantitative yield by reacting homocarnosine or an acylhomocarnosine with an aluminum alkoxide in a hydrophilic or hydrophobic solvent, water, or a mixture of water and such a solvent. In either case, the reaction is generally conducted at room temperature or under mild heating for fractions of hour to several hours. The reaction product thus obtained can be worked up and purified in the per se conventional manner, for example by extraction, recrystallization, concentration, filtration, aqueous washing, activated charcoal treatment, column chromatography, resin treatment, etc. An acylhomocarnosine can be easily produced by acylating homocarnosine with, for example, acetic anhydride, an acetyl halide, a benzoyl halide or the like in the per se conventional manner. The homocarnosine or acylcarnosine for this purpose may be in any of its D form, L form and DL form. The compounds according to this invention have excellent antiulcer and wound healing promoting actions and are, therefore, of value as antiulcer drugs or dermatological therapeutic drugs for external application, therapeutic drugs for stomatitis, therapeutic drugs for hemorrhoids, etc. These compounds are used orally in such dosage forms as tablets, capsules, granules, fine granules, syrups, etc. or non orally as injections, ointments, powders, liquids, etc. For oral administration, the compounds are used generally in a daily dose of 20 mg to 2 9. According to the disease, patient s condition and therapeutic procedure, they can also be used in combination with other drugs. 1. Antiulcer activity a Water immersion stress ulcer Male JCI SD strain rats aged 7.5 weeks and weighing 220 250 g were used in groups of 7 animals. After a fasting period of 24 hours, 400 mg kg of each test compound was orally administered to each animal, and after 30 minutes, the animal was immobilized in a stress cage and was immersed in 230C water down to the level of the thorax for 7 hours. After this stress loading, the rats was exsanguinated by decapitation and the stomach was excised and fixed in 1 formalin for 15 minutes. Then, an incision was made from the pyrolus along the greater curvature and the lengths of the lesions formed in the body of the stomach were measured using a dissecting microscope with a scale graduated in 1 100 cm . The sum of the lengths was used as the ulcer index. The results of the experiment are shown in TableI.

H.G. Shay, S.A.Komarow, S.S. Felds, D. Meranze, M. Gruenstein, and H.Siplet, Gastroenterology, 5, 43 1945 l, and 300 mg kg of each test compound was immediately administered intraduodenally. The incision was sutured and 13 hours after drug administration the rat was sacrified by cervical dislocation. The stomach was excised, slightly inflated by an injection of 1 formalin solution, immersed in the same solution for 15 minutes to fix the gastric wall, and then opened along the greater curvature. The ulcer in the fore stomach was measured under a dissecting microscope to calculate the ulcer index and the efficacy of the drug was expressed in terms of percent ulcer index. The results are shown in Table II.

Wound healing promoting activity method Male rats weighing about 180 g were used in groups of 9 animals. The hair on the back of each rat was clipped with an electric clipper and under ether anesthesia, a wound 20 mm long was made with a chisel having a 20 mm edge in two positions of the cropped back. A suspension of each test compound 10 g in 20 ml of peanut oil was applied to the wound in a volume of 0.05 ml per dose once daily for 10 consecutive days. After 10 days, the animal was bled to death by decapitation and the skin of the back was peeled until the wound was separated. The tension grams required for separating the wound was measured as an indicator of drug efficacy. Results The results are shown in Table III. It is seen that homocarnosine Zn is particularly excellent in wound healing promoting effect.

The test compounds L homocarnosine, N acetyl L homocarnosine and the compounds of Examples l to 9 were respectively administered orally in a dose of 5 g kg each and the animals were observed for 7 days.No death occurred in any of the groups, indicating that all of these compounds are very low in toxicity. The foregoing results may be summarized as follows. The novel compounds 11 according to this invention have excellent anti ulcer and wound healing promoting actions and are very low in toxicity.Therefore, these compounds are of great value as drugs for the treatment of ulcer which usually requires a long time to cure or as other drugs such as dermatological therapeutic drugs for external use.Further, by taking advantage of their pharmacological actions, these compounds may be used as drugs for the treatment of stomatitis, drugs for the treatment of hemorrhoids, and so on.
