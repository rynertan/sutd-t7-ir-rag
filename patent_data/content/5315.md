# Production of xylene hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, especially toluene methylation, is carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising an aluminosilicate zeolite of the ZSM 5 type in which some or all of the protons of the zeolite have been replaced by monovalent cations. Preferably, the replacement cations are sodium ions, the catalyst preferably containing more than 2 by weight of sodium.
