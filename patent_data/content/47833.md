# Data communication signalling interface.

## Abstract
The present interface comprises means for exchanging information between a data terminal equipment DTE and data circuit terminating equipment DCE over a communica tions line. The specific information to be exchanged is the information indicating the delay period between a request to send received at the DCE and a clear to send condition occurring some time later in response to the request to send. The transmitter signal element timing or clock line 8 is used to convey the information from the DCE to the DTE. In response to receipt at the DCE of a request to send signal from the DTE, the DCE temporarily stops the transmission of clock pulses from clock 1 , thus preventing the DTE from transmitting data. When the DCE modem has established carrier frequency and has completed its synchronization routine, the DCE re enables the transmission of clock pulses from clock 1 . The clock signals are transmitted at all times except during the request to send clear to send delay period.
