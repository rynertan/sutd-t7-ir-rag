# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO SUGAR CANE HARVESTERS

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a sugar cane harvester having a pair of contra rotating cutters 33 to cut cane at its base and to lift the cane cut ends first onto a conveyor 40 which delivers the cane through de trashing devices and then to a pair of rollers 53, 54 which draw the cane from the conveyor and propel it into the open end of a container 56 against an adjustable barrier 64 disposed along the container from said open end. The barrier is positioned to suit the length of the cane being harvested and cutters 65 are provided to cut the cane tops from the stalks where they protrude at the open end of the conveyor to separate the tops from the stalks.
