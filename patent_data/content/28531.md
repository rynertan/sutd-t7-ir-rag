# Vibratory device and dental scaler incorporating it.

## Abstract
A vibratory device 10 , such as a dental scaler, in which an air driven rotor 60 is driven about a shaft 42 to impart vibrations thereto and drive a work tool 24 or other object attached to the shaft 42 . A portion 51 of the shaft 42 beneath the rotor 60 has an enlarged diameter such that axial movement of the rotor 60 caused by shaft wear is continuously corrected during rotation. Chamfered end edges 65 of the rotor 60 minimize pressure differentials at the end of the rotor edges 63 and consequently assist in centraliza tion of the rotor 60 about the fluid outlet 70 on the shaft 42 . The fluid outlet comprises outlet ports 70 in the shaft wall beneath the area of rototion of the rotor 60 and having chamfered outside end edges to minimize power losses from turbulence. Additionally, a support 30 is provided along the shaft 42 at a desired vibratory node and has sufficient non resilience to bias the shaft 42 into the desired mode of vibra tion.
