# Ground rod, coupling and method of making such coupling.

## Abstract
A ground rod 10 , coupling 14, 15 therefor and method of making that coupling are disclosed providing both strength and improved conductivity. Ground rods 10 are usually copper 18 coated or plated steel rods 17 , formed in sections 11 13 which are driven or perhaps more correctly pounded into the ground 22 to form grounding or earthing connections for dissipation of electrical current into the earth. The coupling 14, 15 includes co extensive inner and outer sleeves 24 25 34, 35 40, 25 of copper and a corrosion resistant metal such as stainless steel, respectively, which are mechanically interlocked 27, 28 36 along their axial length. The inner copper sleeve is formed with threads 32 or oppositely directed cones 43, 44 after the two sleeves are interlocked and in so doing the interlock between the sleeves in enhanced. If the connection of the coupling to the rod is threaded or a simple cone friction fit, the connection and or driving of the rod sections yet further works the internal copper sleeve enhancing both copper to copper electrical conductivity and the interlock of the inner and outer sleeves.
