# IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An image processing system is disclosed which includes a control computer 10 which has a CPU 14 and a main memory 16 therein and an image memory section 12 which is con nected to the CPU 14 through an interface 26 and which has an image memory 20 for digitally storing image data, a memory controller 44 and an image processor 50 . A memory area 16a as part of the main memory 16 is independently allocated to store as a register area data transferred through a privately leased data bus 28 which bypasses the interface 26 between the control computer 10 and the image memory section 12 . When random access operation of the image data with respect to the image memory 20 is performed, the data transfer between the CPU 14 and the image memory section 12 can be performed through the memory area register area 16a and the special data bus 28 without going through the interface 26 .
