U.S. Sieve Series mesh sizes are used herein. Basically, the equipment used in the invention process is a reaction zone followed by a separation zone. In Figure 1, feed components are fed into the system via lines 66 and 68 and proceed to pump 56 via line 88. The pressurized feed is passed via lines 12, 14, 16 and 18 into the top of reactor 10. In transit pressurized feed passes through heat recovery exchanger 58, steam heat exchanger 62 and gas fired heat exchanger 64. Reactor 10 contains a fixed bed of phosphorus containing catalyst supported on inert catalyst support or a reductive amination catalyst e.g., Ni supported on an inert catalyst support.The reaction product stream effluent is passed via line 22 through heat recovery exchanger 58 and on into ammonia flash tank 52 for the purpose of separating ammonia and any diluent from the liquid reaction product stream. Since hydrogen is used in the feed when a reductive amination catalyst is used, hydrogen will be separated along with the ammonia and any diluent by flash tank 52. The ammonia is taken off through line 36 to condenser 54 the condensed ammonia is recycled to reactor feed line 88 via lines 38 and 90. The bottoms from flash tank 52 are fed via line 24 into ammonia stripping still 20. The ammonia coming off of the top of still 20 is also recycled via lines 42 and 90.The bottoms from ammonia still 20 are passed via line 26 into distillation still 30 maintained at a temperature sufficient to remove the water contained in the reaction through line 44. The heavies from the reaction are recovered from distillation column 30 through line 28 and are passed to still 40 for the recovery of one component by way of line 48. The recovered component can be withdrawn via line 72 or fed via lines 48 and 86 into reactor feed line 88. Another higher boiling component can come off below the top of distillation column 40 and be withdrawn via lines 74 and 76 or fed via lines 74 and 86 into reactor feed line 88.The heavies from the distillation are removed through line 32 into distillation column still 50 from which one component is recovered through, line 70 or fed via line 78 into reactor feed line 88.The bottoms from that separation are removed through line 34 and passed to distillation column still 60 for the recovery of one component which is recycled by way of line 80 to reactor feed line 88 or is withdrawn via line 82. The bottoms of that separation can be passed from line 84 into a batch still or a series of refining columns for recovering each of the various remaining components of the stream. By reaction zone is meant that vessel, e.g., autoclave, continuous stirred tank reactor or packed bed reactor, in which the catalyst is located and the production of polyalkylene polyamines is effected. Although the reactions can be carried out in the batch mode, they are preferably conducted as continuous processes through a bed of particulate catalyst, for example, operation of a continuously stirred tank reactor or a packed fixed bed reactor.The continuous process is carried out by employing conventional process techniques and apparatus well known to those skilled in the art. In the continuous reaction processes, the catalyst can be added alone or in combination with the reactants, or, as stated above, the catalyst can be provided as a fixed bed on conventional support materials well known to those skilled in the art. The reaction is allowed to proceed until a desired conversion is obtained or the reaction is complete. Normally the reaction is carried out within about 0.5 to 5 hours in the batch mode or residence times based on the ethylenediamine and ethanolamine components of 0.1 to 4.0 hours in a continuous mode for practical levels of organic amine condensation product production. The reactor can be an up flow or down flow reactor and can have a fluidized bed or, most commonly, a fixed bed. The catalyst bed can contain inert particles which can be interspersed throughout the bed and or form discrete layers, e.g., at an end or intermediary to the bed. The volume of the reaction zone containing such inert particles is the reaction zone volume for purposes of determining the feed rate. Preferably, the space velocity should not be so high that for the reactor geometry, a significant amount of backmixing occurs. Advantageously, the flow through the catalyst bed is substantially plug type flow. The mole ratio of reactants fed to the reaction zone depends upon the individual organic amine condensation reaction. The reaction is preferably conducted in the vapor phase or the supercritical phase, although the reaction can be conducted in the liquid phase.As used herein, the phrase gas phase encompasses the gas phase and the supercritical phase.The liquid hourly space velocity of the reactants is between about 0.1 and about 100 per hour and preferably is between about 1 and about 25 per hour The reaction is usually conducted at atmospheric or elevated pressure. The pressure at the time of reaction should normally be within the range from about 1 to about 4,000 p.s.i., preferably greater than 100 p.s.i.g. and most preferably from about 200 to about 2,000 p.s.i.g. In any event, the pressure should be selected such that the reaction feedstream is maintained in the desired phase.Normally, a gaseous diluent, such as, hydrogen, methane, helium, water, nitrogen, argon and stoichiometrically excessive ammonia, can be added to increase the pressure in the reactor. In the reactor, the temperature for the reaction depends upon the particular starting materials, ratios of reactants, and most importantly, the activity of the catalyst used. Generally, in the process of the invention, temperatures within the range of 125t to 425 C. are suitable, but the temperature range actually used will depend upon the type of organic amine condensation reaction being run.When a reductive amination catalyst is used, preferably the reaction temperature range is 1500 to 235 C. When a phosphoruscontaining catalyst is used, the reaction temperature is preferably 220 to 350 C. and most preferably 260 to 300 C. A diluent gas can be utilized to help in the control of the reaction temperature and to assist in maintaining the desired pressure. The catalysts used in the invention are heterogeneous catalysts. The catalysts are used in an amount of 0.1 to 12 weight percent, preferably 0.5 to 10 weight percent, and most preferably 2 to 7 weight percent, based on the total weight of the reactants. The catalyst is preferably an amination catalyst, such as, reductive amination catalysts and phosphorus containing catalysts. Any suitable or conventional reductive amination catalyst can be used in the reactor. When a reductive amination catalyst is used, the reactor feed can include hydrogen. Preferably 4 to 12 mole percent, typically about 2 to 20 mole percent based on the total moles of one of the reactants, preferably the most prevalent nitrogencontaining reactant, e.g., ammonia, of hydrogen is used. Reductive amination catalysts are well known in the art and usually comprise the metal or oxide of one or more of nickel, copper, cobalt iron and the like as the active species. Other compounds which can find use in such catalysts include the metal, oxide or salt of one or more of chromium, lanthanum, lithium, potassium, cesium, cerium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, iridium, silver, zinc, titanium, manganese and boron. Often the catalysts are the Raney nickel type or Raney cobalt type, or are supported catalysts.Many of the catalysts ae preferably activated at elevated temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere.Particularly desirable catalysts comprise nickel as the catalytically active species. The preferred reductive amination catalysts are those which are nickel on a catalyst support ma trial and the most preferred are those which are a mixture of nickel and rhenium impregnated on various support materials including alumina, silica, silica alumina, kieselguhr or diatomaceous earth and silica titania. Preferably the mole ratio of the nickel to the rhenium is in the range of from 2 1 to about 30 1 and the total nickel and rhenium metal present is in the range of 3 to 30 percent by weight of the support. Such catalysts can be prepared by the methods taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,1 i 1,840 and 4,123,462, the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference. Basically, such catalysts are solid catalysts wherein the nickel and rhenium metals are supported on certain catalyst support materials. Hydrogen is used in the reactor to maintain the activity of the reductive amination catalyst. The nickeFrhenium catalysts can contain various other metals in admixture with the nickel and rhenium which do not detrimentally affect the catalytic properties of catalysts containing nickel and rhenium as the only impregnated metals. These additional metals, in certain amination processes, can actually improve selectivity and activity of the basic Ni Re catalyst. Certain of these metals can extend the activity life and other physical properties of the Ni Re catalyst. Examples of catalysts containing additional metal components include Ni Re La, Ni Re Ca, Ni Re Mg, Ni Re Sr, Ni Re Li, NiRe K, Ni Re Ba, Ni Re Ce, Ni Re W, Ni Re Fe, NiRe Ru, Ni Re Cu, Ni Re Ag, Ni Re Zn, Ni Re Co,Ni Re U, Ni Re Ti and Ni Re Mn. The amount of Ni Re catalyst present in the process depends on many variables inciuding the reactants, the relative proportions of the reactants, reaction condition and the degree of conversion and selectivity desired. Moreover, the amount of catalyst will depend also on the nature of the catalyst itself, e.g., its metal loading and activity and age. The catalyst must be present in the reaction zone in sufficient catalytic amount to enable the desired reaction to occur. This is also true for any of the catalysts useful in the invention process. Other preferred reductive amination catalysts are catalysts composed of rhenium, nickel and boron impregnated on a support material selected from the group consisting of aluminas e.g., alpha , silica, silica aluminas, kieselguhrs or diatomaceous earths and silica titanias, wherein the ratio of nickel to boron to rhenium is in the range of from about 2 2 1 to about 30 30 1 and the total nickel, boron and rhenium present is in the range of about 3 to about 30 percent by weight of the support material. The most preferred mode of the catalyst is a reductive amination catalyst which has a silica support marketed under the mark T 869e by UnitedCatalyst Incorporated. The best mode of the catalyst is obtained from the United Catalyst Incorporated. It is believed that the catalyst is prepared by impregnating the T 869e catalyst support with an aqueous solution containing nickel nitrate, ammonium perrhenate and boric acid in a metal composition of 66 percent of nickel, 19.6 percent of rhenium and 14.4 percent of boron. Following the impregnation, it is calcined at 330 C. for 2.5 hours.Then it is impregnated a second time with the same solution and calcined again under the same conditions for the same length of time. Thereafter it is impregnated a third time to reach a 12 percent total metal loading. It is then calcined at 330 C. for 2.5 hours. Then it is reduced under a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 332 to 337 C. for 16 hours. Following the reduction step it is stablized at 60 C. for 30 to 40 hours. Examples of other useful reductive amination catalysts are the rhodium atom containing catalysts of U.S. Patent No. 4,322,530, the copper rhenium catalyst of U.S. Patent No. 4,206,149, the nickelcobalt iron catalysts of U.S. Patent No. 3,766,184, the cobalt nickel copper containing aluminum oxide or silicon dioxide support catalyst of U.S. PatentNo. 4,014,933 and the catalysts containing copper oxide or copper hydroxide, nickel oxide or nickel hydroxide, and, optionally, an oxide or a hydroxide of a Group ilA metal of U.S. Patent No. 4,409,339 the pertinent parts of such patents are incorporated herein by reference. U.S.Patent No. 4,209,424 the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference teaches an amination catalyst which has at least one active metal from the group of transition metals consisting of nickel, cobalt and copper, uniformly combined with a refractory microporous substance. The pertinent parts of copending, commonlyassigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No.454,485, filed on December 29, 1982, are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Ser. No. 454,485 discloses a process for the production of an amine composition having a high ratio of diethylenetriamine to piperazine which comprises maintaining ethylenediamine in the presence of a nickel, cobalt or rhodium catalyst, wherein the metal is present on the surface of the catalyst in a polyatomic form, and at a temperature between about 1700 to about 210 C. sufficient to convert less than about 35 percent of the ethylenediamine to polyamine. The catalyst of U.S. Ser.

Preferred catalysts are Raney nickel or Raney cobalt or a Ni Re B on silica catalyst prepared as described in U.S. PatentNo. 4,123,462. The catalyst charge, as a weight percent of the total charge, is not narrowly critical, although a charge of about 3 weight percent is preferred for the reaction temperature and times taught in U.S. Ser. No. 454,485. The reaction conditions and catalysts of U.S. Ser. No. 454,485 can be used in the reaction zone of the invention. The pertinent portions of copending, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. 613,116, filed on May 23, 1984, are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Ser. No. 613,116 discloses reductive amination catalysts which are catalysts comprising a support material selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, silicaalumina, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earth and silicatitania, and nickel and at least one potentiating agent selected from the group consisting of platinum and iridium wherein the catalyst has a total nickel and potentiating agent is in the range from about 1 1 to about 30 1. The potentiated nickel catalyst includes catalysts which contain various other metals in admixture with the nickel and potentiating agent which do not detrimentally affect catalytic properties.These additional metals, in certain amination processes, may actually improve selectivity and activity of the potentiated nickel catalyst. Certain of these metals may extend the activity life and other physical properties of the catalyst. Examples of additional metal components include lanthanum, boron, magnesium, lithium, potassium, cesium, cerium, iron, ruthenium, copper, silver, zinc cobalt, palladium, titanium, manganese, rhodium, and rhenium. The amount of such additional metal components, ratioed to nickel and expressed as an atomic ration, is about 0.001 1 to 1 1, frequently about 0.01 1 to 0.5 1. Particu arly preferred catalysts comprise nickel, iridium and or rhenium. In these catalysts, the rhenium or iridium is generally provided in an atomic ratio to nickel of about 10 1 to 1 10. When a reductive amination catalyst is used, the reaction temperature preferably is 150 to 235or. and most preferably the reaction pressure is 200 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. Any phosphorus containing catalyst can be used. One group of preferred phosphorus containing catalysts is the metal phosphate catalysts, which can be metal phosphates, metal monohydrogen phosphates, metal dihydrogen phosphates and metal pyrophosphates. The metal phosphate catalysts include boron phosphate, aluminum phosphate, ferric phosphate, zinc phosphate, ferrous phosphate, nickel phosphate, chromium phosphate, copper phosphate andcobalt phosphate. Other metal phosphate catalysts which can be used are the phosphates of lithium, sodium, potassium, other metals of Group IA of the periodic tables, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, other metals of Group IIA of the periodic tables, titanium, zirconium, other metals of Group 1VB of the periodic table, antimony and tin valence statesII and IV . Further useful catlysts are those which comprise a phosphorus bonded to a Group IVB transition metal oxide support, such as are disclosed in published European Patent Application 0115138 the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference .Mixtures of two or more of the metal phosphate catalysts can be used. The metal phosphate catalysts also include the pyrophosphates, monohydrogen phosphates and dihydrogen phosphates of strontium, copper, magnesium, calcium, barium, zinc, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, cerium, neodymium, and mixtures thereof.Specific examples of such catalysts are SrHPO4, Sr BaHPO4, Sr H2POe 2, Ca H2PO. 2, Ndz HPOlh, Ce 2 HPO 3, CoHPO4, NiHPO4, Al 2 HPO 3. MgHPO4, BaHPO4, CuHPO. and ZnHPO. The metal phosphate catalysts include the crystalline zirconium phosphates of U.S. Patent No. 3,416,884 and the granular zirconium phosphates of U.S. Patent No. 4,025,608 the pertinent parts of such patents are incorporated herein by reference. The metal phosphate catalysts which are most preferred for practicing the process of the invention are Group IlIB metal acid phosphates includingGroup IIIB metal phosphates, Group tliB metal monohydrogen phosphates, Group IlIB metal di hydrogen phosphates and mixtures thereof. U.S.Patent No. 4,463,193 the pertinent parts of the patent are incorporated herein by reference discloses processes for preparing the Group lilB metal acid phosphates While the intent of the catalyst preparation is to specifically provide a particularGroup I1IB monohydrogen phosphate or dihydrogen phosphate, mixtures of the Group lIB metal phosphates of the above mentoned types can be obtained owing to complicated dependence of the catalyst composition on preparation conditions.Nevertheless, although the Group IlIB metal acid phosphate catalyst of the invention comprises the metal phosphate, monohydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate or mixtures thereof, the monohydrogen and dihydrogen phosphates of theGroup lliB metals are the preferred catalysts when in relatively pure form individually or in combination. A Group IIIB metal is meant to include scar dium, yttrium, lanthanum and the rare earth lanthanide metals having atomic numbers 58 to 71, and the rare earth actinides having atomic numbers 89 to 92. The most preferred metal phosphate catalysts for the production of noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines are the acid phosphates, preferably the monohydrogen phosphates and dihydrogen phosphates, of scandium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, europium, thulium, erbium, ytterbium, yttrium, luetium, thorium, neodymin, praseodymium, dysprosium and gadolinium. The acid phosphate catalysts can be used for the production of polyalkylene polyamines either singly or in combination. It is preferred to use those which are more catalytically active and provide for substantial conversion to the noncyclic polyalkylene polyamine products. Examples of the most preferred catalyst compounds include lanthanum monohydrogen phosphate, lanthanum dihydrogen phosphate, lanthanum phosphate, praseodymium monohydrogen phosphate, praseodymium di hydrogen phosphate, praseodymium phosphates, neodymium monohydrogen phosphate, neodymium dihydrogen phosphate, neodymium phosphate and mixtures thereof. The quantity of the acid phosphate salts of theGroup IIIB metals used in the reaction can vary widely depending upon the reactivity of the catalysts and the reactivity of the reactants present. A catalytically effective amount of material is used for example, an amount which causes a reaction of the ethylenediamine and ethanolamine to yield polyalkylene polyamine products at the temperature and pressure used. Usually though, the amount used to provide a catalytic effect ranges from about 0.1 to 25 mole percent based upon the total amount of reactants present in the reaction mixture, and preferably is an amount of about 0.1 to 10 mole percent. Within these ranges though, the level of catalyst is empirical and is adjusted depending on the product slate desired. The Group IIIB metal phosphate catalysts used in the process of the invention can be prepared by the precipitation of the desired metal acid phosphate salt, washing the salt to remove inorganic coproducts and drying the salt. Optionally, dried catalysts can be further processed prior to use. Such processing is well known to those skilled in the art and includes extrusion or pelleting or compounding with an inert support such as alphaalumina. Methods of preparing Group IIIB metal monohydrogen phosphate or dihydrogen phosphate are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,324,917 the pertinent parts of the patent are incorporated herein by reference . Phosphate containing materials can be obtained which consist predominantly of the Group IIIB metal phosphate, the Group 1118 metal monohydrogen phosphate, the Group 1118 metal dihydrogen phosphate, or mixtures in varying proportions of the Group 1118 metal monohydrogen and di hydrogen phosphates and or mixtures in varying proportions of any of the above Group IIIB metal monohydrogen and di hydrogen phosphates with the Group 1118 metal phosphate.Such variations in catalyst composition can result from dependence of the catalyst composition on preparation conditions, such as temperature, concentration of reagents, stoichiometry of reagents, rate and order of reagent additions, pH of preparation, duration of preparation, volume and pH of water wash, duration of catalyst washing, and duration. and temperature of catalyst drying. In any event, the Group 1118 metal acid phosphates obtained according to the general preparations referred to above are catalytically active for the production of, for example, polyalkylene polyamines. Published European Patent Application 0115138 the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference discloses methods for preparing the catalysts comprising a phosphorous bonded to a Group IVB metal oxide support. Any appropriate liquid or liquifiable phosphorus compound can be used as a source of the phosphorus.For convenience, phosphoric acid will normally be used. However, other phosphorus compounds such as phosphoryl chloride POCI3 , phosphorus acid, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus halides, such as phosphorus bromide, alkyl phosphates and alkyl phosphites such as trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, trim ethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, etc. may be utilized. Also, a diaminohydrogen phosphate such as diammonium hydrogen phosphate, NH4 2H PO4, dimethyldiamino hydrogen phosphate, diethylaminohydrogen phosphate, etc.may be used. The catalyst compositions are prepared by depositing a phosphorus compound on a support comprising an oxide of a group IVb transition metal oxide. The group IVb transition metal oxides include the oxides of titanium, zirconium, hafnium and thorium. Pellets of the group IVb metal oxide may be prepared by extrusion or by compaction in conventional pelleting apparatus using a pelleting aid such as graphite. The phosphorus compound can be on a powdered IVb metal oxide followed by pelleting and calcination. Preferably the catalyst composition is prepared by impregnating a preformed pellet. A suitable procedure to be used is to heat a liquid containing the liquid or liquefiable phosphorus cqmpound at a temperature of about 100C to about 150 C. and to then add pellets in an amount about equal to the volume of the heated liquid.This treatment should be continued from about 0.5 to about 5 hours. At the end of that time, the resulting mixture of pellets and liquid is cooled, decanted to remove excess liquid followed by washing with an amount of water adequate to substantially completely remove unadsorbed liquid.Temperatures above 1500C. can be used, if desired, but there is no particular advantage in doing so. It will be understood that the phosphorous that is present on a thus treated pellet is not present as elemental phosphorous, but rather as phosphorous that is chemically bound, probably as an oxide, to the group IVb metal oxide support. However, the exact nature of the bonding is not completely understood. European Patent Application 0115138 discloses an amount of phosphorous that is bonded or otherwise adheres to the support is a function of heating and other conditions used in the treating step and is also a function of the chemical identity of the phosphorous compound that is used as a source of phosphorous. Under the treating conditions exemplified above, at least about 2.5 weight percent of phosphorous is caused to bond or otherwise permanently adhere to the pellets. There is an upper limit to the amount of phosphorous that bonds or otherwise permanently adheres to the support. This upper limit is, as indicated, a function of both the treating conditions and the chemical used as a source of the phosphorous.Normally, the maximum amount of phosphorous that can be caused to bond or otherwise permanently adhere to the pellets is within the range of about 5 to 10 weight percent. As a matter of convenience, the normal practice is to use only one chemical as the phosphorous source e.g., phosphoric acid . However, mixtures of two or more such reagents may be used, if desired. Calcining is not mandatory if the pellets are impregnated at least at about 100 C., but the pellets can be calcined, if desired. Calcining is conducted for 2 to 24 hours at a temperature of 1000C. but below the temperature at which thermal destruction of the phosphorous bonding occurs. This can be determined experimentally for a particular catalyst. Temperatures above 900 C. should be avoided. A suitable calcining temperature range is normally 200e to 800 C. and, more preferably 500 to 700 C. Other procedures can be used in adding phosphorous to the group 1Vb metal oxide. The pertinent parts of copending, commonlyassigned U.S. Application Serial No. 576,807, filed on February 7, 1984, are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Ser. No. 576,807 discloses certain phosphorous acid or acid derivative compounds which are useful phosphorus containing catalysts within the scope of the invention herein. The term phosphorus acid or acid derivative defines compounds having a P X bond wherein P is a phosphorus atom bonded to a halogen, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atom and wherein X is a radical capable of 1 hydrolyzing to produce the corresponding phosphorus acid structure, or 2 exchanging with a hydroxyl group from the hydroxy alkylene reactant to provide a phosphorus ester. The phosphorus acid or acid derivative catalyst of U.S. Ser. No. 576,807 is believed to function by forming with a alkanolamine or alkylene glycol compound a phosphorus ester in situ. For this reason, it is believed that a requirement for a good phosphorus catalyst is that it contain as a substructure an atom bonded to phosphorus that can be replaced readily by the oxygen atom of a hydroxyi group of the difunctional hydroxyl alkylene compound. Such a replaceable atom might be oxygen as in the case of phosphorus or phosphoric acid or their esters , halogen, nitrogen as in the case of amides of phosphorus or phosphoric acids or another atom that can be transformed into a phosphorus ester by a similar process. Phosphorus containing compounds such as trialkyl and triaryl phosphines and phosphine oxides, which contain no such exchangeable sub structure. do not function as catalysts as defined inU.S. Ser. No. 576,807. Very sterically hindered phosphorus compounds such as hexaethyl phosphoric triamide, while containing the requisite exchangeable substructure and functioning to some extent, are less preferred catalysts because they undergo the exchange process with a alkanolamine or alkylene glycol hydroxyl moieties only slowly.Phosphorus acids are defined by those structures wherein X in the P X radical is a hydroxyl radical.Acid derivatives are defined by structures whereinX is a substitute functional group. Various acid derivatives include salts when X is O M whereinM is a mono or polyvaient cation amides when X is bonded to be phosphorus atom through a nitrogen atom anhydrides when X contains a second phosphorus atom bonded to the first phosphorus atom through an oxygen atom esters when X is OR and so on with regard to other functional groups defined by X. The precise phosphorus acid or acid derivative structure is not critical so long as it fulfills the following two functional requirements when being used in the production of polyalkylene polyamines t that it provides for the relatively selective production of predominantly linearly extended polyalkylene polyamines and 2 that it enables increased conversion rates for polyalkylene polyamine production when water is removed during the reaction, possibly due to the water inhibited formation of a phosphorus intermediate compound during the reaction. The phosphorus acids or acid derivative catalysts of U.S. Ser. No. 576,807 include those having the structure EMI11.1 wherein Y is an oxygen or sulfur atom n is 0 or 1 X is hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, or the thio analogs of the foregoing, alkyl or aryl substituted amino, halo, or the salts or phosphorus anhydrides or thioanhydrides of the foregoing when X is hydroxy or mercapto and R and R are hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or one of the groups previously defined by X. Suitable phosphorus acid or acid derivatives ofU.S. Serial No. 576,807 which can be employed included, for example, acidic metal or semi metal phosphates, phosphoric acid compounds, and their anhydrides, phosphorus acid compounds and anhydrides, alkyl or aryl phosphates, alkyl or aryl phosphites, alkyl or aryl substituted phosphonic acids and phosphinic acids, alkali metal monosalts or phosphoric acid, phosphorus amides and phosphoric amides, the thio analogs of the foregoing, and mixtures of any of the above. Suitable acidic metal or semi metal phosphates include boron phosphate, ferric phosphate, aluminum phosphate and the like. Suitable phosphoric acid compounds include aqueous or anhydrous phosphoric acids, such as orthophosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and condensed phosphoric acids such as polyphosphoric acids.Any commercially available mono , di , or trialkyl or aryl phosphate or phosphate ester can be employed. In addition, bis phosphates and secondary phosphate esters, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,869,526 and U.S. Patent No. 3,869,527, respectively, can be utilized. Suitable alkyl or aryl substituted phosphonic acids or phosphinic acids include alkyl phosphonic acids, aryi phosphonic acids, alkyl phosphinic acids and aryl phosphinic acids. Examples of such phosphorus acid or acid derivative compounds include phenyiphosphinic, ethylphosphonic, phenylphosphonic, napthaphosphonic, and methyiphosphinic acids methyl phenylphosphonate, dimethyl phenylphosphonate, methyl phenylphosphinate, ethyl naphthaphosphinate, propyl methylphosphonate and hexamethyl phosphoric triamide, hexaethyl phosphoric triamide and their analogous phosphorus triamides.Preferred phosphorus catalysts include hexamethyl phosphorus triamide, hexaethyl phosphorus triamide, boron phosphate, ferric phosphate, aluminum phosphate, phosphoric acid and phosphorus acid. The amount of phosphorus acid or acid derivative catalyst of U.S. Ser. No. 576,807 utilized is a catalytically effective amount to cause condensation of the reactants to produce the desired organic amine condensation products. This quantity will vary depending upon the reaction conditions and catalyst utilized. Usually a catalytically effective amount will be from about 0.01 to about 10 mole percent and preferably from about 1 to about 3 mole percent, based on the moles of reactants used. The pertinent parts of copending, commoniyassigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No.606,000 filed on May 2, 1984, are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Ser. No. 606,000 discloses certain phosphorus amide catalysts which are compounds having at least one phosphorusnitrogen, i.e., P N bond. Preferably, the P N bond is part of a P N H or P N C substructure. Compounds containing suitable P N bonds can have three, four, or five substituents about the phosphorus. Suitable compound catalysts of U.S. Ser.

If R , R , or Y contains hydrogen bonded to O, S, or N, such as when R or R is hydroxy or mercapto or Y is monoalkylamino, then corresponding metal salts containing P O M, P SM, or P N M linkages, where M is a monovalent or polyvalent metal or semi metal ion, and anhy drides, thioanhydrides, and condensed phosphorus amides containing respectively P O P, P S P. andP N P linkages can be suitable catalysts as well. Suitable phosphorus amide catalysts of U.S.Ser.

The alkyl or aryl substituents on these substances can be linked to phosphorus through more than one atom, so as to form cyclic members of the above classes containing such heterocyclic rings as 1 ,2 diazaphospholidine, EMI13.1 1 ,3,2 oxazaphospholidine,EMI13.2 tetrahydro 2H 1 3,2 oxazaphosphorine, EMI13.3 and the like. Such cyclic phosphorus amides can also be used as catalysts in the invention. An additional class of phosphorus amides ofU.S. Sen No. 606,000 that can be useful as catalysts in the invention comprise azophosphoranes in which nitrogen is bound directly to phosphorus.Examples of such compounds include 1,6 dioxa4,9 diaza 5 phospha 5 PV spiro 4.4 nonane,EMI13.4 and 2.3,5,6,8,8 hexahydro 8 methyl 1 3,2 oxazaphospholo 2,3 b 1 ,3,2 oxazaphosphole, EMI14.1 Preferred phosphorus amide catalysts of U.S. Sen No. 606,000 include hexamethyl phosphorus triamide, hexaethyl phosphorus triamide and the phosphorus amide reaction product of ethylenediamine with phosphoric or phosphorus acid. U.S. Patent No. 4,503,253 the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference dis closes catalysts which are phosphorus or phos phoric acid on an inert support. Inert supports which can be utilized include silica, alumina, car bon silica alumina clays and molecular sieves, e.g., aluminosilicates. The weight of phosphoric acid to support is variable and its optimum level will de pend upon the reactants and operating conditions. Typically, the weight of phosphoric acid to support is from 1 to 85 percent. Phosphorus containing cation exchange resins can be used in this invention and can be prepared by the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,324,9t7. The cation exchange resins provide ex changeable phosphorus containing ions such as phosphonous, phosphonic, phosphoric and phos phorus. Preferably the resins useful here are weak acid cation exchange resins containing one or more of the above phosphorus containing exchangeable ions. Duolite commat resins available from Diamind Shamrock Corp. are typical commercial phosphorus containing resins. Examples of these are Duolite 0 ES 62, Duolite commat ES 63, and Duloite s ES 65 which are the phosphonous, phosphonic and phosphoric acid types. respectively. When a phosphorus containing catalyst is used, the reaction temperature is preferably 220or. to 350 C. most preferably 260 to 300 C. and most preferably the reaction pressure is 200 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. Any of the non resin phosphorus containing catalysts useful in the invention can be supported on carriers, such as, silica, silica alumina, silica titania, alumina, diatomaceous earth Kieselguhr and any other conventionally employed inert reac tor packing material. Generally, the catalysts are supported. The active catalyst species are provided on the surface of the support through, for example, coating or impregnation. The catalyst say metal components on the support often comprises about 1 to 50, say, about 3 to 30, weight percent of the catalyst. Useful supports can be porous and have surface areas of from about 0.1 to 500, say, about 0.3 to 100, square meters per gram. The catalyst can be of any convenient size or shape. Catalysts can be made in the form of powders, spherical or conical pellets, extruded strips and the like. Impregnated spherical pellets ranging in diameter from 1 8 inch to 3 16 inch and extruded strips of a cylindrical type shape ranging from 1 32 inch to 1 2 inch in length are typical of those which can be used as supports. Often, for commericalscale operations, the pellets range in diameter from about 0.1 to 1 centimeter. By separation zone is meant those apparatus, e.g.. stills, distillation columns, condensors, adsor bers, flash off units or evaporators, in which a reaction product stream is separated into at least one component. The separation zone can be a conventional separation zone used for the separation of any reaction product stream containing at least one organic amine condensation product. For example, an organic amine condensation product is separated from the first reaction product stream in the separation zone and then a different organic amine condensation product is separated from the second reaction product stream in the same separation zone. U.S. Patent No. 4,00,539 the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference discloses a separation scheme which could be used in the invention process. Initially, for example, the reaction product stream exiting from the reactor can be passed into a conventional flashing unit to flash off the diluent and or excess ammonia, plus any hydrogen . This allows more efficient operation of the distillation columns. After any diluent and or excess ammonia plus any hydrogen have been flashed off, for example, the reaction product stream can be fed into a series of distillation columns to remove the various reaction products and by products and unreacted feed components. PREPARATION OF POLALKYLENE POLYAMINES Polyalkylene pdlyamines can be prepared by r.eacting an alkylenediamine having at least two amino groups e.g., ethylenediamine and an alkanolamine having at least one amino group e.g., ethanolamine . Noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines, such as, diethylenetriamine and cyclic polyalkylene polyamines, such as piperazine, can be prepared. For the production of polyalkylene polyamines, the reactor is operated most preferably at a pressure of 200 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. most preferably at a temperature of 260 to 300 C., when a phosphorus containing catalyst is used or preferably at a temperature of 1500 to 2350C. when a reductive amination catalyst is used. Also, preferably a metal acid phosphate catalyst or Ni reductive amination catalyst is used in the reactor. Any amination catalyst can be used. Preferably the reaction is conducted in the vapor phase or supercritical phase. The alkyleneamine having at least two amino groups is preferably an unbranched alkylene moiety, such as, ethylenediamine, and preferably has primary amino groups. The alkanolamine preferably has a primary or secondary hydroxyl moiety and preferably amino group s . Preferably, the alkanolamine has an unbranched alkylene moiety. The alkanolamine compounds used in the invention process include those represented by the formula EMI15.1 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl C, to C4 radical, R is hydrogen or an alkyl C, to C2s radical, x is a number from 2 to 6, and y is a number from 0 to 3. Examples of suitable alkyl radicals are the lower C, to C alkyls, such as, methyl, ethyl and butyl, and higher alkyls, such as, octyl, decyl and octadecyl. Methyl is the preferred lower alkyl radical. However, it is preferred that R and R both are hydrogen thus the alkanolamine would contain a primary amino group.Examples of useful alkanolamine compounds are the ethanolamines, isomeric propanolamines, N 2aminoethyl ethanolamine, N methylethanolamine,N,N dimethylethanolamine, N,N,N trimethylaminoethylethanolamine and the like. The alkyleneamine reactants used in the invention process are represented by the formula EMI15.2 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl C. to C. radical, R is hydrogen or an alkyl C, to C25 radical, x is a number from 2 to 6, and y is a number from 1 to 4. Examples of suitable alkyl radicals are the lower C, to C. alkyls, such as, methyl, ethyl and butyl, and higher alkyls, such as, octyl, decyl and octadecyl. It is preferred that R and R are both hydrogen. The preferred lower alkyl radical is methyl.

In the reactor, the temperature for the reaction depends upon the particular starting material, ratios of reactants, and most importantly, the activity of the catalyst Used. Generally, in this embodiment of the process of the invention, temperatures within the range of about 125C to 425 C. are suitable. A diluent gas can be utilized. A relatively high pressure of the reaction is also preferred. Normally, a diluent, such as, hydrogen, helium, water, nitrogen, methane or argon, can be added t9 increase the pressure in a batch reactor and the volumetric flow in a fixed bed reactor. The pressure at the time of reaction should normally be within the range from about 50 to about 4,000 p.s.i.g. In any event the pressure should be selected such that the reaction feedstream is maintained in the desired phase. Ammonia or a primary amine or a secondary amine can also be used in the feed to the reactor.In fact, the reaction preferably is conducted with ammonia present in the feed. The ammonia is both a reactant and a diluent when excess of it is present in the invention process. When ammonia is used, the mole ratio of ammonia or the primary amine or the secondary amine to the combination of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine is usually in the range of 20 1 to 1 20 and preferably in the range of 12 1.25 to 1 1. Ammonia and the preferred primary and secondary amines which are used in the invention process are represented by the formula EMI16.1 wherein R is hydrogen or an alkyl C, to C2s radical, preferably a lower alkyl C, to C radical, such as methyl or ethyl. Stoichiometrically. one molecular unit of ammonia or amine primary or secondary is required per molecular unit of hydroxyl group.However, the formation of diethylenetriamine is favored by the presence of excess ammonia, but a practical limit on the amount of ammonia employed exists due to energy consumption. Useful amine feedstocks include monomethylamine, dimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, octylamine and octadecylamine. Use of secondary amines instead of ammonia leads to polyalkylene polyamines containing terminal dialkylamino groups. Altematively, use of primary amines instead of ammonia leads to polyamines which contain randomly distributed monoalkylamino groups. The invention process generally predominantly produces noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines if the proper procedures, conditions, etc., are followed and observed. Noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines that are generally produced by the reaction of alkanolamine, plus an alkylenediamine are represented by the formula EMI16.2 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl C, to Ct radical, preferably a methyl radical, X is a number from 2 to 6, Y is a number from 2 to 7, and X can vary for a given value of Y.Examples of such noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines that are produced are dipropylenetriamine, tributylenetetramine, di 2 methylethylene triamine, tri 2 methylethylene tetramine, N 2 amino ethylf 1,3 propylene, diethylenetriamine and the noncyclic isomers of tetraethylenepentamine. It is generally desirable not to coproduce significant amounts of by products, particularly cyclic amines, especially piperazine and aminoethylpiperazine, that are of less commercial value than diethylenetriamine. Cyclic polyalkylene polyamines that are produced by the reaction of a an alkyleneamine and an alkanolamine or b ammonia, an alkyleneamine and an alkanolamine or c an alkanolamine and ammonia are represented, for example by the following formula EMI17.1 wherein R is hydrogen, an alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl grup containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms, R is hydrogen or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X is hydrogen or CH2CH2Y and Y is OH or NH2.

Noncyclic polyalkylene polyamines include polyalkylene polyamines having straight chain and branched alkylene groups. Polyethylene polyamines are useful as corrosion inhibitors, fabric softeners, iubricating oil additives, comonomers for polyamide resins, fungicides, surfactants, curing agents for epoxy resins and chelating agents. Diethylenetriamine is specifically useful as a solvent for sulfur, acid gases, various resins and dyes and as a saponification agent for acidic materials.PREPARATION OF TRIETHYLENEDIAMINE Triethylenediamine or its carbon substituted derivatives can be prepared by the invention process. Triethylenediamine is also termed diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane or DABCO commat . For example, triethylenediamine is prepared from N aminoethylpiperazine.

U.S. Patent Nos. 3,297,701 and 3,080,371 the pertinent parts of such patents are incorporated herein by reference discloses the conditions gen erally used in preparing di abicyclo 2.2.2Foctane and its derivatives from the above mentioned start ing materials. The effluent from the reaction zone contains significant amounts of compounds in which the ethylene group CH2 CH2 has a nitrogen at one end and either a nitrogen or an oxygen at the other end. Moreover, such effluent contains at least mi nor amounts of the compounds present in the feedstock. Representative members of the com pounds which might be formed as conversion pro ducts from the reaction zone include ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenediamine, piperazine, diethanolpiperazine, di betaaminoethyl piperazine, and triethylenetetramine.

TEDA is particularly useful as an accelerator or catalyst in urethane systems empolying a variety of isocyanates and polyols as reactants.PREPARATION OF ETHYLENEDIAMINE Ethylenediamine can be prepared from ammonia and monoalkanolamine and can be prepared from a stream containing ammonia, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine, as produced by the direct reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia. For the production of ehtylenediamine, the reactor is operated normally at a pressure of 50 to 4,000 p.s.i.g., preferably a pressure of greater than 100 p.s.i.g., and most preferably at a pressure of 200 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. When a reductive amination catalyst is used, preferably the reaction temperature is 1500 to 235 C. When a phosphorus containing catalyst is used, preferably the reaction tem perafure is 220 to 350 C. Preferably the reaction is conducted in the vapor phase or supercritical phase. The pertinent parts of U.S. Patent No.4,400,539 are incorporated herein by reference.Alkanolamines are prepared by the conventional reaction of ammonia and ethylene oxide. Any of the processes described in the prior art which involve the reaction of ethylene oxide with ammonia to produce a mixture of monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine can be used. A desirable process is one which produces a mixture in which monoethanolamine is present in amounts greater than 50 weight percent of the total concentration of alkanolamines. Illustrative of such processes are those described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,196,554, 3 697,598 and 3,723,530. The reaction converts the products of the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia, which products contain, inter alia, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine, to ethyleneamines. In the typical practice of the invention, the reaction serves to convert such products into ethylenediamine. As mentioned above, the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia produces a stream which contains essentially ammonia, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.The amount of ammonia in the product mixture is subject to the amount of ammonia which is utilized in the reaction with ethylene oxide. In the typical case the amount of ammonia which will be used will be vastly in excess of the stoichiometry of the reaction to produce the product mixture and therefore the available ammonia which is used in the reaction between ethylene oxide and ammonia will in large part be adequate from the subsequent amination reaction to produce the ethyleneamines.The feed stream can also contains recycled monoalkanolamine and optionally ammonia. Usually the feed stream contains at least 70 weight percent monoethanolamine based on the total ethanolamines content, not more than about 30 weight percent diethanolamine, same basis, not more than 15 weight percent of triethanolamine determined on the same basis, and the sum of the diethanolamine and triethanolamine does not exceed 30 weight percent. of the total ethanolamine content thereof. The amination feed stream also contains ammonia in an amount which is in stoichiometric excess of the alcoholic hydroxyl groups which are present in the amination feed stream. Usually there are contained at least 10 moles of ammonia for each mole of ethanolamine present in the feed stream. The amination feed stream can also possess a limited amount of water. The water content in the feed stream can range between 0 weight percent to 10 weight percent, based on the weight of the amination feed stream. Gaseous diluents such as nitrogen, water, helium, methane and the like can also be present in the reaction zone. Such gaseous diluents can be utilized. The reaction temperature is broadly about 125 to 425 C. Preferably the feed stream within the reaction zone is under supercritical fluid or vapor phase conditions although the liquid phase can be used . Therefore, the pressure within the reaction zone should preferably be correlated with the temperature so as to achieve either the supercritical fluid conditions or a vapor phase condition.The reaction pressure broadly ranges between 50 and 4,000 p.s.i.g. After the reaction product stream is removed from the reaction zone, it is subjected to a variety of separation steps from the purpose of removing the various components contained therein. For example, the effluent gas stream from the amination zone will be subjected to distillation to remove water, ammonia ethylenediamine, monoethylpiperazine which can be recycled . hydroxyethyl piperazine, aminoethylethanolamine, tetraethylenepentamine, diethylenetriamine, aminoethylpiperazine, piperazine, triethylenetetramine. diethanolamine and triethanolamine. Because of the vast differences between the boiling points of monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine, the separation of monoethanolamine from the composition is very readily obtained and an extremely pure stream of monoethanolamine can be produced by simple distillation.In the normal course, the monoethanolamine which can be obtained by distillation will contain at least 99 weight percent of monoethanolamine with extremely small amounts of piperazine, diethylenetriamine, aminoethylpiperazine, hydroxyethylpiperazine, and the like, being present.PREPRARATION OF ALKYLAMINES Aliphatic amines, such as, alkyl amines, can be prepared by reacting an aliphatic alcohol, such as, an alkanol, and an aliphatic aldehyde, with ammonia or a primary amine or a secondary amine. For the production of the methylamines, the reactor is operated most preferably at a pressure of 200 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. and most preferably at a temperature of 325 to 375 C. For the production of higher alkylamines, the reactor is operated most preferably at a pressure of 100 to 2,000 p.s.i.g. and preferably at a temperature of 150 to 200 C. A metal acid phosphate catalyst is preferably used for the production of methylamines and a reductive amination catalyst e.g., Ni is preferably used for the production of higher alkylamines. Preferably the reaction is conducted in the vapor phase or supercritical phase. The alkanols have the formula R,CH20H wherein R, is a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having t to 10 carbon atoms. Examples are methanol, ethanol, propanol, isobutanol and octanol. The alkyl aldehydes have the formula EMI20.1 wherein R is a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, prionaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde and n valeraldehyde. The primary or secondary alkyl amines having the formula EMI20.2 wherein R2 and R3 each is a hydrogen atom or a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples of such amines are dimethyl amine, diethylamine, methylamine and heptylamine. The product is an alkyl amine having the formula EMI21.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings set out just above. Of particular interest is the catalyzed reaction of butanol and ammonia to produce monobutylamine, dibutylamine and tributylamines. Generally, the mole ratio of ammonia to butanol can range from about 1 1 to 5 1, and preferably ranges from about 1.5 1 to 2.5 1. If butylamine is the desired product, it is advantageous to carry out the process with the proportion of ammonia to butanol in a stoichiometric excess, e.g. up to about 3 1 or more. In the preparation of the methylamines, the reaction is broadly 230 to 430 C. If the temperature is too low, the conversion of methanol and ammonia to methylamines will be low. If the temperature is too high, hydrocarbon by product formation and catalyst coking becomes a significant problem. The pressure utilized for carrying out the reac tion is broadly about 1 to 75 atmospheres.PREPARATION OF MORPHOLINE AND ITS DERIVATIVES Morpholine and morpholine compounds can be prepared from diglycolamine and diglycolamine compounds, respectively. For the production of morpholine and its derivatives, the reactor is normally operated at a pressure of 50 to 4,000 p.s.i.g., and most preferably a reaction temperature of 220 to 3500C. is used. Also, preferably a metal acid phosphate catalyst or a Ni catalyst is used in the reaction. Preferably the reactor is conducted in the vapor phase or supercritical phase. Morpholine compounds having the formula EMI21.2 wherein R5, R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each is hydrogen or an alkyl radical, andR4 is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, saturated heterocyclic or aryl radical, can be prepared by contacting a glycol having the formula EMI21.3 wherein R , R2 and R3 have the meanings given above, with ammonia or an amine having the formula H2N R wherein R has the meaning given above, in the presence of a phosphorus compound, at a temperature of from 200 to 350 C., under a pressure sufficient to maintain the reactants in the liquid phase. By varying the glycol and the ammonia or amine utilized, one can achieve, for example, C alkyl substituted morpholines or N substituted morpholines. The primary amine may be a substituted or unsubstituted aryi amine or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl amine. The N substituted morpholine compounds that can be produced have the formula above in which R is an alkyl radical, a substituted alkyl radical, an aryl radical or a substituted aryl radical.Examples of these compounds are N methyl morpholine, N phenyl morpholine, N aminoethyl morpholine, N 2 N ,N dimethyiaminoethyl morpholine and N methyl 2,6 di ethyl morpholine. R1, RZ, Rl and R may contain substituted moieties which are nondeleterious to the reaction, for example oxy, thio or tertiary amino moieties. The glycol that can be used has the general formula above wherein R , R2 and R3 are independently an alkyl radical e.g., having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydrogen. The preferred glycol is diethylene glycol. The primary amine that can be utilized has the formula above wherein R has the meaning given above. Examples of suitable primary amines are methylamine, ethylamine, aniline, 2,6dimethylaniline, the naphthylamines, N 2aminoethyl morpholine, N 2 aminoethyl piperazine, and C aminoalkyl morpholines. Additionally, R may contain substituted moieties which are nondeleterious to the reacton such as oxy, thio or tertiary amino moieties. The only requirement of the above compounds is that they contain a nitrogen moiety having two labile hy drogens and that the constituents or moieties linked with the nitrogen are not, or do not contain, constituents deleterious to the reaction. For example, primary amines containing a second primary amine group so that the primary amine can be an alkylene diamine or a hydroxy group can be used, but they will often substantially increase the byproducts and side reactions. The diglycolamine compounds can be, for example, alkyl diglycolamines, wherein each of the alkyl groups contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In such case, the morpholine derivative products would be alkyl morpholines, wherein each of alkyl groups contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The reaction is broadly conducted at a temperature between 250 and 350 C. Preferably reaction conditions are chosen which minimizes the production of dioxane by product. Normally, the glycol and ammonia are reacted at molar ratios of from 1 1 to 20 1, preferably 2 1 to 10 1, moles of ammonia per mole glycol compound. Normally, the glycol and the primary amine are reacted at molar ratios from 0.5 1 to 20 1, and preferably 1 1 to 10 1, moles of glycol per mole of primary amine.
