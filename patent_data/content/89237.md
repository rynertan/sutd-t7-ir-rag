# Single plane optical membrane switch and keyboard.

## Abstract
Photo optical switch apparatus useful for example in keyboard switches includes a photopolymerized orthogonal matrix of horizontal and vertical intersecting light channels or guides, monolithically formed by exposure to ultraviolet light on a flat planar, plastic substrate. Each intersection has a refractive index higher than either the channel or the adjacent substrate area. A curved tap or light coupler couples the horizontal to the vertical channel of the array. The intersections of the channels are disposed over an array of upstanding projections on a flat mounting substrate with each projection located at a respective intersection of the horizontal and vertical light channel. A light absorbing key pad is arranged over each intersection to couple light from the channel up into the key pad. A relative loss of light indicates the key being depressed.
