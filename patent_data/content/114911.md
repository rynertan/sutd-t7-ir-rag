# Novel repressurization for pressure swing adsorption system.

## Abstract
Gaseous mixtures are separated on a two zone two columns connected in series per zone carbon molecular sieve pressure swing adsorption system to produce a gas stream enriched in at least one component. This process includes the partial pressurization of an absorbent zone with lean gas in the range of 40 to 90 percent of the adsorption pressure.
