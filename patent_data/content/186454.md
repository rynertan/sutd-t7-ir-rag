## Description
The invention relates to 6 purinyl N 2 chloroethyl carbamate and thiocarbamate of the general formula I The pertinent literature reports certain 6 purinyl derivatives of carbamic acid, eg N 6 purinyl N aryl and N alkylureas A S Jones et al, Tetrahedron The subject compounds of formula I can be prepared by reacting the respective 6 substituted purine derivative of the general formula II The starting purine derivatives of formula II, ie hypoxanthine X 0 and 6 mercaptopurine X S , are commercially available materials. The preparation of 2 chloroethylisocyanate is described at several places in the literature cf eg Siefken W, Ann Chem Suitable inert media for the aforementioned reaction are advantageously dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, phosphoric acid hexamethyltriamide or tetramethylurea. The reaction of hypoxanthine or 6 mercaptopurine with 2 chloroethylisocyanate proceeds rather slowly yet, surprisingly, it is unexpectedly accelerated in the presence of one to two molar equivalents of an alkaline agent, preferably a tertiary organic amine such as, eg triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 1 ethylpiperidine, 4 methylmorpholine or the like, whereby the reaction rate is approx by an order of magnitude increased and also the yield of the desired product is substantially higher. The compounds of the invention are either slightly soluble in the aforementioned solvents and separate spontaneously from these media during the reaction, or can easily be isolated from the reaction mixture by dilution with water and subsequent filtration. The subject compounds of the general formula I, ie 6 N 2 chloroethyl carbamoyl thiopurine compound Ia, X S and its oxygen analogue, 6 N 2 chloroethyl carbamoyl oxypurine compound Ib, X 0 , show a remarkable antineoplastic activity in pharmacological experiments both The antineoplastic activity of the compounds of the invention has been investigated testing the compounds of the chemical group The therapeutic effect for the purposes of the invention means the inhibition of characteristic disease symptoms in biological subjects bearing tumours which are namely tumour growth, shortening of the survival period of biological subject and increasing the number or the growth of tumour cells. Tumour growth may be observed clinically or in experiments Such a useful therapeutical effect of the compounds of the present invention has been proved in experiments with S180 and or STE tumour bearing female mice H. In comparison with untreated control animals significantly lower mean tumour weights have been observed in treated groups of animals cf examples 3 and 4 . Additionally, the compounds of the present invention are useful in increasing survival time of the suitable biological subjects, namely mice and rats bearing tumours STE, ZAH and or Y because the lethal nature of the test system employed, the antitumour effect of the compounds is illustrated by a side by side comparison of the survival time of treated animals those which survived for a longer time with the untreated control groups of animals cf examples 5, 6, 7 . In these typical experiments ten animals were in the experimental groups and the treated groups of animals survived for a longer time than the untreated controls. Moreover, in some cases the antitumour effect of the compounds of the present invention has been proven in experimental conditions in which the clinically useful and structurally similar compound 6 mercaptopurine was inactive cf example 8 . The result of the experiment is in agreement with the idea that mechanism of action of the compound Ia is different from that of clinically used 6 mercaptopurine. This effect may be clinically useful in all cases of the resistance of the tumour or leukaemia against an antimetabolite of this class. Additionally, the therapeutic synergism of the compounds of the general formula I with other cytostatic drugs has been proven, for example, in combination chemotherapy with Benfluron 5 2 N,N Dimethylamino ethoxy 7 oxo 7H benzo c fluorene hydrochloride CAS 80427 58 3 cf example 9. The groups of animals treated by combination of the compound Ia with the cytostatic drug Benfluron survived for a highly significant longer time p 0. 01 than the untreated animals of the control group or animals treated with Benfluron alone. The foregoing examples indicate that the compound Ia may be effectively used alone or in combination with other cytostatic drugs for treatment of malignant neoplastic diseases. In experiments The compounds of the present invention are also potent inhibitors of DNA and protein biosyntheses of tumour cells. This conclusion clearly followed from example 12. Inhibition of any of the vital biosynthesis mentioned above is attainable as a result of antitumour activity of cytostatic drugs. The compounds described herein can be administered to suitable biological subjects, particularly mammals, for their therapeutic antitumour effects by conventional modes of administration alone, but preferably as active ingredients with any conventional suitable non toxic pharmaceutical carrier, dissolved or suspended, for example, in water, saline, polyethylene or polypropylene alcohols, etc. The administration is preferably by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the type of tumour for which treatment is desired, the type of biological subject involved, weight, body surface, localisation to the tumour, its morphological type, the frequency of treatment, individual tolerance and responsiveness of each subject, etc for example, by oral route, the prolonged administration of 100, 200 mg kg daily appears to be well tolerated both in the rat and in the mouse. The assessment drawn from the biological tests is that doses of 20 mg kg eg, about 740 mg m² could be regarded as well tolerated in man. The compounds are hardly toxic for example, the compound Ia is practically non toxic the LD₅₀ in small rodents was assessed up to 3 g kg by oral route . It is understood that therapeutically useful effects can be expected to occur upon the administration of such doses that are completely non toxic to the respective mammalian organism. The process for preparing the subject compounds of formula I as well as their selected biological assay results are illustrated by the subsequent non limitative examples. Melting points were determined on Kofler block and are not corrected, yields are indicated in stoichiometric of theory. A suspension of 6 mercaptopurine monohydrate 17. 0 g, 0. 1 mole in dimethylformamide 150 ml is treated with triethylamine 10.1 g, 0.1 mole and the solid is dissolved by warming of the mixture to 50 60 C. The solution is cooled to 15 C and 2 chloroethylisocyanate 11.6 g, 0.11 mole is dropped in under cooling with tap water to 15 20 C. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 2 hours, and the precipitated product is collected on filter, washed with acetone and dried under reduced pressure at a temperature of approx 50 C to give 20.7 g 80 of the title compound Ia melting at 221 223 C. UV absorption spectrum in dimethylsulfoxide , To a suspension of hypoxanthine 6.8 g, 50 mmoles in dimethylformamide 200 ml there is added triethylamine 5.05 g, 50 mmoles and then, at 15 20 C, 2 chloroethylisocyanate 5.8 g, 55 mmoles is dropped in. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature until dissolution of the solid approx for 2 hours , thereafter poured into an ice water mixture 750 ml , the precipitate of the title product is separated by suction, washed with acetone and dried at room temperature. The yield is 8.2 g 67.8 of compound Ib, mp 320 340 C with decomposition , UV absorption spectrum in dimethylsulfoxide , Sixty female mice H weighing approximately 20 g were divided into three groups one control group and two experimental groups of 20 animals each. A lethal dose of the Crocker tumour S180 homogenate was implanted subcutaneously to all the animals. The experimental groups were treated with the substance Ia in water suspension. The suspension contained the substance Ia in such an amount that a dose 0.4 or 0.2 ml of the suspension po was equal to a dose 200 or 100 mg Ia kg. This dose was administered to the experimental animals once a day, eight times altogether, starting on the fifth day after the implantation. On the fourteenth day after the implantation, half of the animals in each group were killed by ether anaesthesia, tumours were removed and weighed. The remaining animals were left to monitor the time of death. Statistically, significantly lower average values of the tumour weight were observed in the treated animals in comparison with the untreated control group. In analogous experiments carried out on the animals with implanted Ehrlich tumour STE female mice H weighing approximately 20 g, 20 animals per group the treated animals exhibited statistically significantly lower average values of the tumour weight in comparison with the untreated control group. The results of the experiments are summarized in the following table. Fifty infantile female Wistar rats weighing approximately 60 g were divided into five groups one control and four experimental ones, 10 animals in each. A lethal dose of the tumour ascites from Zajdel ascitic hepatoma was implanted intraperitoneally to all the animals. The experimental groups were treated with the substance Ia in water suspension. The suspension contained the substance Ia in such an amount that a dose of 0.4 or 0.2 ml of the suspension po was equal to a dose of 200 or 100 mg Ia kg. This dose was administered to the experimental animals once a day, five times altogether, starting on the first day after implantation. The results are summarized in the following table. As in Example 5 an experiment was performed in an analogous fashion upon animals with implanted Yoshida tumour infantile female Wistar rats weighing approximately 60 g, 10 animals per group and resulted in a statistically significantly higher average value of the survival period in the treated animals in comparison with the untreated control group. The results of the experiment are summarized in the following table. As for examples 5 and 6 an experiment was performed in an analogous fashion upon animals with implanted Yoshida tumour infantile female Wistar rats weighing approximately 60 g, 10 animals per group showed a statistically significantly higher average value of the survival period in the treated animals in comparison with the untreated control group. The results of the experiment are summarized in the following table. An experiment analogous to those of examples 5 to 7 performed in animals with implanted Zajdel ascitic hepatoma infantile female Wistar rats weighing approximately 60 g, 10 animals per group showed a statistically significantly higher average period of survival in the animals treated with the substance Ia but not in those treated with 6 mercaptopurine, in comparison with the untreated control group. The results of the experiment are summarized in the following table. One hundred and twenty seven infantile female Wistar rats weighing 50 60 g were divided into 16 groups one control group of 25 animals and fifteen experimental groups of 6 to 7 animals. A lethal dose of the tumour ascites from Yoshida ascitic sarcoma was implanted intraperitoneally to all the animals. The experimental groups were treated with the substance Ia in water suspension, water solution of a cytostatic Benfluron CAS 80427 58 3 , or a combination of both the substances. The suspension or solution contained the substances in such a concentration that doses 0.4 or 0.2 and 0.1 ml of the suspension solution po were equal to doses 200 or 100 and 50 mg Ia kg or to doses 160, 80 or 40 mg Benfluron kg. Doses of the substance Ia were administered to the experimental animals once a day, four times altogether, starting on the first day after the tumour implantation. Benfluron was administered only once, on the fourth day after the tumour implantation, 7 hours after the last dose of the substance Ia. Over a period of 29 days it was observed that all the animals in the control group died on the fifth to the fifteenth days after the implantation while the groups treated with the substance Ia or with its combination with the cytostatic Benfluron survived longer with an average statistical significance α 0.05 or a high statistical significance α 0.01 . The results of the experiment are summarized in the following table. The degree of influence on the incorporation of ¹⁴C from adenine ¹⁴C and valine ¹⁴C to the fraction of Ehrlich Carcinoma cells insoluble in trichloroacetic acid serves as the measure of cytotoxicity. The value ID₅₀ is the concentration of a cytostatic that reduces the ¹⁴C incorporation down to 50 of the non influenced control cells. The results of the experiment are summarized in the following table. In analogous experiments to those already described the degree of influence on the initial velocity of the incorporation of ³H from 5 iodo 2 deoxy 6 ³H uridine or that of ¹⁴C from a mixture of L U ¹⁴C aminoacids to the fraction of Yoshida ascitic tumour cells insoluble in trichloroacetic acid serves as the measure of cytotoxicity. The values IC₅₀ is the concentration of a substance that reduces the initial velocity of the ³H or ¹⁴C incorporation down to 50 of the non influenced control cells.The results are summarized in the following table. In analogous experiments to those described above the following values of IC₅₀ were determined.
