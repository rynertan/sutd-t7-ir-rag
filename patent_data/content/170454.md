# FSK demodulator.

## Abstract
Clock pulses b are applied to a first counter 7 and are gated with the FSK signal a and applied to a second counter 6 which is reset by the output of the first counter 7 when the lower, mark frequency pertains. When the higher, space frequency pertains, the first counter 7 is reset by the inverted FSK signal c and the output of the second counter 6 goes true and is latched in a D type flip flop 8 . An R S flip flop 9 is reset by the latched output when the space frequency pertains but is set by the output of the first counter 7 when the mark frequency pertains. The output h of the second flip flop 9 is the demodulated signal.
