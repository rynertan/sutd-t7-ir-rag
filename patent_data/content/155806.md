## Description
HAIR CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions for application to and care of human hair. More particularly, it relates to improved compositions for conditioning hair. Products which improve the appearance, feel, and manageability of hair have gained increasing acceptance and popularity with consumers. The utility of such compositions is particularly important with the use of such hair treatments as permanent waving, dyeing, teasing, and bleaching. The physical condition of hair can also be affected by atmospheric conditions, such as sunlight, which may cause photo catalyzed oxidation.These factors may result in hair with poor texture, which is difficult to manage and comb, whether wet or dry. Accordingly, compositions which condition hair generally improve the manageability, appearance and feel of hair, as by reducing dry static and increasing the ease of combing both wet and dry hair. Such conditioning products are well known. Some are rinse type products which are applied and rinsed off the hair, while others are deep conditioners which are allowed to remain on the hair for extended periods of time. Many conditioning products contain long chain quaternary ammonium compounds combined with fatty materials, such as fatty alcohols.Such compositions are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,155,591, Hilfer, issued November 3, 1964 and U.S. Patent 4,269,824, Villamarin, et al., issued May 26, 1981. While such products have particularly good cosmetic in use and rheologic characteristics, they may leave the hair greasy or oily, and subject to resoiling with dirt and sebum. These undesirable characteristics are, unfortunately, related to the conditioning benefit, since such products as they are known in the art inherently lead to deposition of both vehicle and conditioning active materials on the hair. A variety of compositions have been developed which attempt to provide good conditioning benefits while maintaining acceptable cosmetic in use and rheologic characteristics. In particular, volatile silicone oils are well known for use in conditioning products. For example, British Patent Specification 1 ,598,567, Lewis, et al., published September 23, 1981, discloses hair conditioners containing volatile silicones and certain surfactants. An essential feature of these compositions is their freedom from fatty materials and quaternary ammonium compounds. British PatentSpecification 999,222, published July 21, 1965, discloses organosilicone polymers in water alcohol mixtures for use as hair conditioners U.S.Patent 4,374,825, Bolich, et al., issuedFebruary 22, 1983, discloses conditioners containing hydrocarbon or silicone conditioning agents, certain nonionic water soluble thickening agents, and a cationic conditioning agent. U.S.Patent 4,387,090, Bolich, issued June 7, 1983, discloses conditioning compositions containing volatile hydrocarbon or silicone conditioning agents and certain polymeric thickening agents.U.K. Patent Application 2,066,659, Abe, published July 15, 1981, discloses conditioning hair rinse compositions comprising quaternary ammonium salts, silicone materials, and propylene glycol. It has now been discovered that hair conditioning formulations containing a dimethicone copolyol and a silicone conditioning agent, in a gel vehicle consisting of a lipid material and a cationic surfactant, have improved hair care benefits while maintaining excellent in use characteristics. In particular, such compositions exhibit lower resoiling of hair after use than similar compositions that do not contain the dimethicone copolyol. Thus, such products provide excellent conditioning benefits with low resoiling, while maintaining preferred rheology. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides hair conditioning compositions comprising at from about 0.1 to about 10 of a silicone conditioning agent b from about 0.01 to about 10 of a dimethicone copolyol c from about 0.1 to about 10 of a lipid vehicle material d from about 0.05 to about 5 of a cationic surfactant vehicle material and e the balance of water.Preferably, the lipid vehicle materials are fatty alcohols or fatty esters. These products are preferably used as rinse type conditioners. Thus, the present invention also provides methods of conditioning hair by applying the compositions to freshly shampooed hair and rinsing the composition from the hair. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The conditioning compositions of this invention contain five essential ingredients a silicone hair conditioning agent a dimethicone copolyol a lipid vehicle material a cationic surfactant vehicle material and water.

Methods of Manufacture The conditioning compositions of the instant invention can be prepared by methods well known in the art. Specific procedures for forming compositions may vary, however, depending upon such factors as the particular components used and the product rheology that is desired. In general, compositions may be made by simple admixture of components into heated water, cooling, and milling. While the aqueous bulk mixture is generally maintained, during the initial admixture of components, at a temperature above the melting point of the highest melting component, the temperature may have to be reduced before adding volatile or other temperaturesensitive components. Certain components may be premixed and then added to the aqueous batch mixture. For example, formulation of conditioning compositions containing high molecular weight silicone conditioning agents may be facilitated by premixing the silicone conditioning agent with a volatile silicone oil. Methods of Use The hair conditioning compositions of the present invention are preferably used as a rinse on freshly shampooed hair.Preferably all shampoo is rinsed from the hair prior to application of the conditioning product. Thus, the present invention provides methods of conditioning hair, comprising the steps of a applying from about 1 gram to about 60 grams of a composition of the present invention to freshly shampooed hair and b rinsing the composition from the hair.Preferably, from about 5 grams to about 30 grams of the composition are applied.

EXPERIMENT I Four formulations were prepared which had the same compo edition as the products described In Example I , but with the following variation in levels of silicone materials present. Weight silicone conditioning dimethiconeComposition active copolyol A 0 0 B 0 0.5 C 0.5 0 D 0.5 0.5 To the extent that these compositions contained levels of silicone conditioning active or dimethicone copolyol lower than inComposition D, the amount of water was increased. Each of these compositions was applied to hair switches in order to determine the levels of vehicle materials and silicone containing materials that remained on the hair after rinsing. Specifically, 20 switches of hair, weighing 4 grams and approximately 203 mm long, were prepared by stripping in a 90 10 mixture of methylene chloride and methanol, for one hour. The switches were then washed with a conventional shampoo for 30 seconds, rinsed for 30 seconds, shampooed again for 30 seconds, and finally rinsed for 60 seconds. The shampoo rinse shampoo rinse sequence was then repeated. One of Compositions A, B, C or D was then applied to each switch of hair. A total of 5 switches were used to evaluate each composition. The respective test composition was dispersed thoroughly throughout each switch, and then the switches were rinsed for 30 seconds. Gloves were worn throughout the treatment procedure, and changed between each product treatment. The switches were then air dried. Samples were cut from each dried switch, placed in tared vials, and weighed. Ten milliliters of a suitable solvent, such as a 90 10 methylene chloride methanol solvent mix, were added to each vial, and the vials agitated for approximately 18 hours. The extracted solution was then filtered and placed in tared vial.The level of cationic surfactant was then determined using HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography. The amount of siliconecontaining material was determined using Atomic AdsorptionSpectroscopy. The following table presents the levels in micrograms per milligram of hair of cationic surfactant and silicone containing material present in the switches treated with each Composition TABLE I cationic silicone containingComposition surfactant material A 0.307 B 0.196 0 C 0.286 0.19 D 0.176 0.18 less than the 0.02 gimg minimum detection level The levels of cationic surfactant vehicle material deposited from Compositions B and D containing a dimethicone copolyol were significantly different than the levels deposited fromCompositions A and C without the silicone copolymer , at a 95 confidence level LSD 0.070 This data thus demonstrates that the dimethicone copolyols of the present invention significantly reduce the levels of cationic surfactant vehicle material deposited on hair during use.This data also shows that the dimethicone copolyol material is not, itself, deposited in significant amounts.Therefore, this data demonstrates that the dimethicone copolyol reduces undesirable deposition of vehicle materials on treated hair without significantly reducing the deposition of the silicone conditioning agent. EXPERIMENT IIFour formulations A, B, C and D were made, each composed identically to those tested in Experiment I. The compositions were applied to hair switches. After the switches were soiled with synthetic sebum, the switches were then graded by expert judges in order to determine the cleanlinessldirtiness of the switches. In particular, 48 switches of hair were prepared by rinsing each for 15 seconds at approximately 38 C, washed for 30 seconds using a conventional shampoo, rinsing for 30 seconds, and then soaking for one hour using a 90 10 methylene chloridelmethanol mixture. Each switch was again rinsed for 15 seconds, washed for 30 seconds with a conventional shampoo, rinsed for 30 seconds, washed again for 30 seconds, and finally rinsed for 60 seconds.Thereafter, one of each of Composition A, B, C or D was applied to each switch, using 1 milliliter of product per gram of hair.Composition A vehicle only was applied to 18 switches, Composition D of the present invention was applied to 12 switches, andCompositions B and C were applied to 6 switches, each. The rinse formulations were then dispersed throughout their respective hair switches, and allowed to remain for 60 seconds. The switches were combed and rinsed for 60 seconds. The switches were allowed to dry overnight and then weighed A solution of synthetic sebum containing materials corresponding to those found in natural sebum was then sprayed on each switch until a predetermined weight of sebum was applied. The switches were then allowed to equilibrate at approximately 270C and 80 relative humidity. The switches were paired as detailed in Table II, below.Each pair of switches was then evaluated by ten expert judges, and rated on a scale ranging from not soiled to heavily soiled . Higher scores indicated less soiled cleaner switches. The pairings and results are set forth below. TABLE II Degree ofPair Compositions tested Cleanliness 1 A vehicle only 50 B vehicle dimethicone 57 copolyol 2 A vehicle only 57 C vehicle silicone 55 conditioner 3 A vehicle only 66 D present invention 75 4 C vehicle silicone 49 conditioner D present invention 63 The scores for Pairs 7, 3 and 4 reflect significant differences in cleanlinesslsoiling between switches in each pairl at a 95 confidence level. This data thus demonstrates that the compositions of the present invention such as Composition D exhibit lower soiling of hair after use than similar compositions that do not contain dimethicone copolyol.
