## Description
Interleukin 1 IL 1 is a protein synthesized ara secreted by activated macrophages. As part of thebody s defense mechanism against infection and otner forms of injury, this polypeptide hormone stimulatesthe proliferation and or differentiation of a broad spectrum of cell types including T and B lymphocytes,liver cells, bone marrow cells, connective tissue elements, skeletal muscle, brain cells, etc. . Through itsactions on these diverse cell populations, IL 1 modulates immune function. fever, liver cell function increased synthesis and secretion of acute phase reactants increased uptake of amino acids, iron andzinc , production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, skeletal muscle proteolysis, changes inconnective tissue, etc. IL 1 has also been described in the prior art as lymphocyte activating factor LAF ,leukocyte endogeneous mediator LEM , endogeneous pyrogen EP , and mononuclear cell factor MCF .Until recently all studies of IL 1 were conducted with partially purified protein preparations, therefore, it hasnot been certain whether all the activities associated with IL 1 are contained within one molecule, or whetherfragments of IL 1 or other macrophage proteins are responsible for certain of the functions outlined above. Since it has been difficult to prepare sufficient amounts of human IL 1 for structural and activity studies,the biochemical nature of this molecule is poorly understood. IL 1 preparations show evidence of size andcharge heterogeneity. IL 1 activity is associated with single polypeptide chains with molecular weightsanywhere in the range between 12,000 and 19,000. Recently, the gene coding for mouse IL 1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia Coli Lomedico et al.. Nature 312, 458 462 1984 . In conjunction with the sequencing studies on purified natural mouse IL 1, it was possible to understand how this hormone is synthesized to yield the populationof molecules possessing size and charge heterogeneity. When purified natural mouse IL 1 is electrophoresedon SDS polyacrylamide gels. one finds multiple polypeptides with molecular weights between12,000 and 19.000. all of which are biologically active. These polypeptides have different amino terminalsequences and demonstrate charge heterogeneity on Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels. Sequencing of thecloned mouse IL 1 cDNA and in vitro translation expenments proved that IL 1 is initially synthesized as aprecursor polypeptide of 270 amino acids. Biologically active IL 1 can be obtained from E. coli byexpressing the carboxy terminal 156 amino acids of this precursor. Hence, IL 1 activity is proteolyticallyreleased from the carboxy terminus of the 270 amino acid precursor protein. Multiple points of proteaseattack will generate a population of molecules with ragged amino termini, thus providing an explanation ofthe size and charge heterogeneity observed in purified natural IL 1. The cloning of a putative gene for human IL 1 was described by Auron et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 81, 7907 7911 1984 which was published in February 1985. The DNA and protein sequencesdescribed therein are only partially homologous to the sequences described below. The purification of natural human IL 1 to homogeneity has been reported by Lachman Fed. Proc. 42.2639 2645 1983 . The method used molecular weight fractionation, isoelectric focusing and preparativepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the last step, the productwas denatured and exhibited only a trace of its original biological activity. See also Schmidt J. Exp. Med.160, 772 787 1984 for a purification scheme using HPLC methods to produce a single charged species ofhuman IL 1 and Kronheim et al. J. Exp. Med. 161, 490 502 1985 . It has also been known in the art to produce antibodies directed against murine IL 1 Mizel et al., J.Immun. 131, 1834 1837 1983 . These antibodies, which were raised in goat, were utilized to develop anassay for IL 1 and also in the production of an anti IL 1 immunoabsorbent column which in turn is useful forfurther purification of either natural or recombinant munne IL 1. The anti murine IL 1 antibody crossreactspoorly with human IL 1. The present invention relates to the cloning of the human IL 1 gene, its engineering into suitableexpression vectors, transformation of host organisms with such expression vectors and production ofbiologically active recombinant human IL 1 by culture of such transformed cells. Additionally, the presentinvention relates to the isolation and use of the resulting recombinant human IL 1 polypeptide. Thus, the present invention utilizes recombinant DNA technology as the means to discover the DNAsequence and the deduced amino acid sequence for human interleukin 1 and to its production and to itsuse. More particularly, the present invention relates to the isolation and identification of a DNA sequencecoding for biologically active form of human interleukin 1. This was accomplished by employing a mouseIL 1 cDNA clone to isolate a partial human IL 1 genomic clone. This genomic clone was used in turn toisolate a human IL 1 cDNA clone. The sequence of this cDNA revealed the structure of the human IL 1precursor protein. Expression of the carboxy terminal 154 amino acids of this precursor in E. coli resulted inthe production of biologically active IL 1 protein. European Patent Application. Publication Nos. 188 864 and 188 920, which both are pnor rights withregard to the present case, relate to the cloning of two genes coding for the human interleukin 1 precursorpolypeptide. EP 188 864 discloses the expression of a gene coding for a IL 1 precursor polypeptide in COS 7 cellsand predicts that the mature hlL 1 polypeptide comprises amino acid residues 113 to 271 of the amino acidseauence of the hIL 1 precursor polypeptide. A DNA coding for the said mature hIL 1 polypeptide wasexpressed in E. coli. EP 188 920 is based on five priority applications, only two of which were filed prior to the first prioritydate of the present case. The first priority application discloses the nucleotide sequence and thecorresponding amino acid sequence of a human interleukin 1 precursor polypeptide containing 271 aminoacids and a fragment thereof having an amino acid sequence extending from position 63 to position 271 ofthe amino acid sequence of the said human interleukin 1 precursor polypeptide. The second priorityapplication of EP 188 920 relates to rabbit interleukin 1 whose amino acid sequence differs considerablyfrom that of human interleukin 1. On the other hand the present application discloses for the first time a minimum carboxy terminussequence of the amino acid sequence of the human interleukin 1 precursor polypeptide needed forbiological activity. Said minimum carboxy terminus sequence extends from position 118 to position 271 ofthe amino acid sequence of the human interleukin 1 precursor protein. Thus the present applicationprovides a novel human interleukin 1 IL 1 polypeptide free of other human polypeptides which IL 1polypeptide has an amino acid sequence corresponding in identity and position to the amino acidsequence of a mature IL 1 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence More particularly the presentinvention provides a polypeptide having the amino acid seauence defined above. The polypeptide of thepresent invention may optionally contain an initiator methionine and are preferably free of any glycosylation. The present invention also provides cloned genes coding for the said polypeptide, which cloned geneis preferably prepared from a messenger RNA produced from normal peripheral human blood leukocytesinduced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore the present invention provides a cloned gene whichis an incomplete copy of the human IL 1 mRNA having the nucleotide sequence shown in figure 2A but noadditional nucleotide sequence from the human IL 1 mRNA. The present invention also provides expression vectors comprising a cloned gene coding for apolypeptide of the present invention and a DNA sequence capable of propagating and expressing the saidgene in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. i.e. a promoter DNA sequence. whereby said gene is located at aposition downstream of the said promoter sequence. The preferred expression vectors are capable ofreplication in eukaryotic cells or in gram negative bacteria. most preferably in an E. coli strain. such as theexpression vectors phil 1 154 and phil 1 154 described below. The present invention also providesprocaryotic and eukaryotic cells which are transformed with such expression vectors. The present invention also relates to processes for the preparation of the polypeptides of the presentinvention, of expression vectors comprising cloned genes encoding the said polypeptides as well as toprocesses for the preparation of eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells capable of expressing the cloned genescomprised in the said vectors. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical preparations suitable for parenteral administration,said preparation comprising a minor, effective amount of the human interleukin 1 polypeptide of the presentinvention in homogeneous form and a mayor amount of a conventional pharmaceutical parenteral carriermaterial. Thus, more particularly, the present invention relates to the isolation and identification of DNAsequences encoding the human IL 1 precursor and biologically active molecules contained therein, and tothe construction of expression vectors containing such DNA sequences operatively linked to expression effecting promoter sequences. In another aspect, the present invention relates to host culture systems, suchas various microorganism and vertebrate cell cultures transformed with such expression vectors and thusdirected to the expression of the DNA sequences referred to above. In other aspects, this invention relatesto the means and methods of converting the end products of such expression to novel entities, such aspharmaceutical compositions, useful for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of humans or in diagnosticassay systems. In preferred embodiments, this invention provides particular expression vehicles that areconstructed properly such that human interleukin 1 is produced in the host cell in mature form. The present invention will be more readily understood when considered in connection with theaccompanying drawings Figure 1 shows the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of mouse IL 1 precursorcDNA. Figure 2A shows the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the carboxy terminalregion of human IL 1 precursor from phil 7 with the partial sequence of phil 4 indicated byunderlining, while 2B shows the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the humanIL 1 precursor as deduced from a composite of clones phil 7 and phil 19. Figure 3 illustrates the sequence homology of the mouse and human IL 1 precursor proteins. Figure 4 is a flow chart showing the construction of an expression vector which directs the synthesis of amodified 154 amino acid carboxy terminal sequence of human IL 1 phil 1 154 using pEV vrf 2 as avector. Figure 5 is a flow chart showing the construction of expression vector phil 1 154 which directs thesynthesis of the 154 amino acid carboxy terminal sequence of human IL 1 without the extraneous aminoacids at the amino terminus of phil 1 154 . As indicated above the cloned gene coding for a human IL 1 polypeptide may be obtained by use of amouse IL 1 cDNA clone as a hybridization probe. In such a procedure, an EcoR1 partial human genomicphage library Fritsch et al., Cell 19, 959 972 1980 was screened using as the hybridization probe theplasmid plL1 1301 Lomedico et al., supra . Phage plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose filters bystandard methods Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. 1982 and the filters 138 mm containing the immobilized DNA werehybridized in 10 ml solution containing 5XSSPE 1XSSPE 0.18M NaCI, 10 mM Na phosphate, pH 7.0,1mM Na The partial human IL 1 gene obtained as above was then employed as a probe to isolate a human IL 1cDNA clone derived from mRNA obtained from induced normal human peripheral blood leukocytes. Thehuman leukocyte concentrates, collected and prepared from normal donors were obtained from theAmerican Red Cross, Lansing, Michigan. The contents from 50 leukocyte concentrates were asepticallyremoved from the collection bags and pooled. The leukocyte pool was mixed with a half volume of a 6 solution of hetastarch Hespan, American Hospital Supply Corp., Irvine, California in a separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 3 hours at room temperature. This procedure differentially sedimented thecontaminating red blood cells from the leukocytes. The volume of the leukocyte Hespan mixture shouldnot exceed two thirds of the volume of the separatory funnel to insure proper sedimentation. The red bloodcells sedimented to the bottom of the separatory funnel and cell separation was complete when a sharpinterface band of white cells was apparent just above the red cell layer. The low density white blood cellswere used for the production of interleukin 1. These cells were removed from the separatory funnel bycarefully aspirating only the uppermost layer of cells located above the interface white cells. The lowdensity leukocytes were removed from the Hespan by sedimentation in 250ml conical centrifuge tubes Corning Glassworks, Corning, New York at 500xg for 20 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 9volumes of a 0.83 solution of ammonium chloride for 5 minutes to lyse the remaining red blood cells. Theleukocytes were removed from the ammonium chloride solution by sedimentation at 500xg for 10 minutesas described above. The cell pellet was then resuspended to a concentration not exceeding 3.5 10 A particularly preferred procedure for isolating poly A Since human IL 1 cDNA clone 7 turned out to be an incomplete copy of human IL 1 mRNA, thefollowing strategy to complete the sequence was adapted Based on the DNA sequence of clone 7, asynthetic oligonucleotide with the sequence 5 GGGCGTCATTCAGGATGAATTCGTA 3 was devised andsynthesized using solid support phosphoramidite technology. This oligonucleotide is complementary to thesequence coding for amino acids 20 28 as predicted from phil 7. The oligonucleotide spans a region in thecDNA predicted to contain an EcoRI restriction site. Such a site is useful for fusing an extension clone withclone 7 to create a cDNA encompassing the complete protein coding region for the human IL 1 precursor.This oligonucleotide was annealed to size fractionated poly A Plasmid phil 7 contains the coding information for the carboxy terminal 163 amino acids of the 271amino acid human IL 1 precursor protein. Plasmid phil 19 contains the coding information for the amino terminal139 amino acids of this protein. Each plasmid possesses a single EcoR1 restriction endonucleasecleavage site within the sequence 94 nucleotides long that is common to their inserts. This EcoR1 site canbe used to join the information from the two plasmids into a single composite plasmid containing the entirecoding region from the human IL 1 precursor protein. Using standard methods, plasmids phil 7 and phil 19 can be individually digested with EcoR1 and Bam HI, and the resultant DNA fragments separated bypolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Plasmid pEV vrf2 is a pBR322 derivative modified using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides to contain aribosome binding site RBS initiation codon downstream from a tightly regulated phage Œª P pRC2 is a derivative of pBR322 ATCC No. 37017 containing a unique BgIII site adjacent on the amp pRC23 was constructed by inserting into pRC2 a 250 bp BgIII HaeIII fragment containing the Œª P For the construction of plasmid pEV vrf2, pRC23 was digested with EcoRI and Hind III and thelinearized vector isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. Two complementary deoxynucleotides 3 AATTAATATGAATAGAATTCGGATCCATCGATA, 4 AGCTTATCGATGGATCCGAATTCTATTCATATT were synthesized supra , combined and heated to 58 C for 5 minutes in 150 mM NaCI, andcooled slowly to allow annealing. 0.1 pmoles of the synthetic duplexes were added to 0.07 pmoles of thepRC23 EcoRI HindIII vector and incubated with T4 DNA ligase at 15 C for 15 hours. Strain RR1 pRK248clts was transformed with the ligation products, and ampicillin resistant transformants werescreened by restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis to identify pEV vrf2, the expected construction ofwhich was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid pEV vrf2 contains restriction sites EcoRI, BamHI,Clal, and HindIII located downstream from an appropriately positioned initiation codon RBS. Hence,appropriately positioned coding region sequences inserted into these restriction sites will be expressedunder control of the P The synthetic oligonucleotides used above were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380ADNA synthesizer. Diisopropyl phosphoramidites were used as the active nucleotidyl component for couplingto the support see Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 1859 1862 1981 . Synthesis on thesupport was carried out at 0.5mmol level using a CPG resin with the 3 nucleotide attached to the resin asdescribed by Matteucci and Caruthers, supra. The synthetic cycle was essentially the same as provided bythe manufacturer, however, 2 dichloroacetic acid was used in place of 3 trichloroacetic acid as thedetritylating reagent. Synthesized oligonucleotides were isolated on 20 polyacrylamide sequencing gels.Isolated oligonucleotides cut out from the gel were eluted in gel elution buffer and desalted on C With the recombinant DNA thus obtained, living cells may be transformed to amplify the cloned cDNAor to produce IL 1 polypeptide. Suitable eucaryotic host organisms, which may be employed for production of IL 1, include vertebra,yeast and the like. For instance, monkey cells, e.g. CV 1 cells, transformed by a replication origin defectivemutant of SV 40 and expressing the SV 40 large T antigen COS cells as discussed by Gluzman Cell 23,175 182, 1981 , mouse derived cells described by Ohno and Taniguchi Nucleic Acids Research 10, 967 977 1982 , and yeast host vector systems which have been utilized for the expression of interferongenes, discussed by Hitzeman et al. Nature, 293, 717 722 1981 may be utilized. In addition, it is possibleto use insect cells such as described by Smith et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 2156 2165, 1983 . Suitableprocaryotic host organisms include Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and the like. For amplification of DNAin host organisms, it may be preferred to use E. coli as a host, however other hosts can also be employed. Suitable vectors used for E. coli include EK type plasmid vectors stringent type pSC101, pRK353,pRK646, pRK248, pDF41 etc., EK type plasmid vectors relaxed type ColEI, pVH51, pAC105, RSF2124,pCR1, pMB9, pBR313, pBR322, pBR324, pBR325, pBR327, pBR328, pKY2289, pKY2700, pKN80, pKC7,pKB158, pMK2004, pACYC1, pACYC184, dul etc., Œª gt type phage vectors Œª gt. Œªc, Œª gt, ŒªB, Œª WES, Œªc, Œªgt. ŒªB, ŒªWES, ŒªC, ŒªWES, ŒªB, ŒªZJvir., ŒªB , ŒªALO, ŒªB, ŒªWES. Ts622, ŒªDam etc. In general pBR322 hasbeen frequently used as a vector for E. coli. Transformation of the host cell with the recombinant DNA may be carried out by conventionally usedmethods as follows Where the host is prokaryotic such as E. coli, competent cells which are capable of DNA uptake areprepared from cells harvested during the exponential growth phase and subsequently treated by the CaCl Where the host used is eucaryotic, transfection methods of DNA as calcium phosphate precipitatesconventional mechanical procedures such as microinjection, insertion of a plasmid encapsulated in redblood cell hosts or in liposomes, treatment of cells with agents such as lysophosphatidylcholine, or use ofvirus vectors, or the like may be used. However, various other microbial strains are useful, including known E. coli strains such as E. coli B., E.coli X 1776 ATCC No. 31537 and E. coli W 3310 ATCC No. 27325 , and most preferably E. coli RR1 ATCC No. 31343 or other microbial strains such as MC 1061, many of which are deposited and availablefrom depository institutions, such as the American Type Culture Collection ATCC cf. the ATCC cataloguelisting. See also German Offenlegungsschrift 2644432. These other microorganisms include, for example,Bacilli such as Bacillus subtilis and enterobacteriaceae among which can be mentioned as examplesSalmonella typhimurium and Serratia marcescens, utilizing plasmids that can replicate and expressheterologous gene sequences therein. As examples, the beta lactamase and lactose promoter systems have been advantageously used toinitiate and sustain microbial production of heterologous polypeptides. Details relating to the make up andconstruction of these promoter systems have been published by Chang et al., Nature 275, 617 624 1978 and Itakura et al., Science 198, 1056 1063 1977 , which are hereby incorporated by reference. Morerecently, a system based upon tryptophan, the so called trp promoter system, has been developed. Detailsrelating to the make up and construction of this system have been published by Goeddel et al., NucleicAcids Research 8, 4057 4074 1980 . Numerous other microbial promoters have been discovered andutilized and details concerning their nucleotide sequences, enabling a skilled worker to ligate themfunctionally within plasmid vectors, have been published see, e.g., Siebenlist et al., Cell 20, 269 1980 . The expression system hereof may also employ the plasmid YRp7, which is capable of replication inboth E. coli and the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A useful strain is RH218 deposited at the AmericanType Culture Collection without restriction ATCC No. 44076 . However, it will be understood that anySaccharomyces cerevisiae strain containing a mutation which makes the cell trp1 should be an effectiveenvironment for expression of the plasmid containing the expression system. An example of another strainwhich could be used is pep4 1. This tryptophan auxotroph strain also has a point mutation in the TRP1gene. The experience with expression of mouse IL 1 cDNA in E. coli suggests that the carboxy terminalportion of the human IL 1 precursor should possess IL 1 biological activity. Clone phil 7 described above,contains the coding information for the carboxy terminal 163 amino acids of the human IL 1 precursor.There is an Alu I restriction endonuclease cleavage site near the 5 end of the phil 7 insert see figure 2A within the codon for the ninth amino acid that is, the 155 The protein encoded by expression plasmid phil 1 154 contains, in addition to the initiator methionine,6 extraneous amino acids at its amino terminus. These were removed by site directed mutagenisis asfollows 1 2¬µg of plasmid phil 1 154 were subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion in two separatereactions. In one reaction, 1 2 units of both Bgl II and Bam HI created a linearized plasmid with a gap seefigure 5 , and in the other reaction, 1 unit of Pst I generated a linearized plasmid. Pst I treatment wasfollowed by treatment with 1 unit of Klenow fragment of E.Coli DNA polymerase I. These opened plasmidswere purified by electrophoresis through a 0.7 agarose gel and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Eachplasmid was resuspended in 5¬µl H20. A 1¬µl aliquot was taken from each and was combined with 50ng ofphosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide 5 P ATTGCTCAGGAACATATTAATTCC OH 3 in a 12¬µl reactioncontaining 12mM Tris.HCI, pH 7.5, 9mM MgCl The single stranded region was made double stranded and the plasmid was ligated in a 20¬µl reactionvolume of 75¬µM dATP, 75¬µM dTTP, 75¬µM dCTP, 75uM dGTP, 500¬µM ATP, 2 3 units of the Klenowfragment of E.coli DNA polymerase I and 1 unit of T Like many other recombinant proteins see Williams, D.C. et al., Science 215, 687 689 1982 Lacal,J.C. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. 81, 5305 5309 1984 , human interleukin 1 aggregates into insolublecytoplasmic inclusion bodies within E.coli. Hence the purification of recombinant human IL 1 begins withthe isolation of these inclusion bodies see Lacal et al., supra . E. coli cell paste 1 g was suspended in 5 ml of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in buffer A 30mM Tris HCI, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA and the cells were sonicated six times for a total of 3 minutes using aSonifier cell disrupter Model 350 Branson Sonic Power Co. . The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 minutesat 30,000 X g to separate the insoluble fraction. The particulate fraction which contains most of IL 1 activity was sequentially washed with 5 ml each of 1 buffer A, 2 1 Triton X 100 in buffer A and 3 1.75 Mguanidine HCI. After each wash, the particulate fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 X g for 20minutes. IL 1 activity was solubilized from the remaining particulate fraction by 3 ml of 5 M guanidine HCI,followed by centriguation at 30,000 X g for 30 minutes. Up to this step, all procedures were carried out at4 C. The solubilized IL 1 protein was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl5 200 or Sephadex G 75 Phamacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J. equilibrated and eluted with 5Mguanidine HCI. The purified 1 154 IL 1 behaved as a single polypeptide on SDS polyacrylamide gels Laemmli, U.K., Nature 227, 680 685 1970 . When submitted for amino acid compositional analysis andamino terminal sequence analysis, the expected results were obtained, thus verifying the purity and identityof the protein. In similar fashion E.coli transformed with phil 1 154 were used to produce 1 154 proteinwhich was purified as above. Experiments with the expression products of deletion mutants of the mouse IL 1 gene has provided abasis for determining the minimum sequence which provides a bioactive protein from the carboxy terminalof the mouse IL 1 precursor. The results are summarized below in Table I. As seen in Table I the sequence proximal to the carboxy terminus is needed for activity. A minimum ofabout 139 amino acids is apparently required to maintain activity as the 17 156 exhibits high activity,whereas deletion of an additional thirteen amino acids at the amino terminus of this fragment destroys theactivity. The purified recombinant human IL 1 peptide encompassing the sequence needed for biologicalactivity can be employed in a manner known per se to stimulate the immune system of a host subject, suchas. for example, by improving host defense response to pathogens. by acting as a vaccine adjuvant and byenhancing host defense against neoplastic diseases. Other clinical uses identified for human IL 1 in the artinclude promotion of wound healing via stimulation of fibroblast proliferation and improvement of therecovery of critically ill, protein malnourished patients. Purified IL 1 peptide prepared in accordance with this invention may be administered to warm bloodedmammals for the clinical uses indicated above. The administration may be by any conventional methodsuch as by parenteral application either intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Obviously, therequired dosage will vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, theduration of the treatment and the method for administration. A suitable dosage form for pharmaceutical usemay be obtained from sterile filtered, lyophilized IL 1 peptide reconstituted prior to use in a conventionalmanner. It is also within the skill of the art to introduce buffers. stabilizers, bacteriostats and other excipientsand additives conventionally employed in pharmaceutical parenteral dosage forms.
