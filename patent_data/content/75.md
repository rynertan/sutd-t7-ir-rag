This head water can be polluted with much sludge or another pollutant. In order to reduce pollution of the environment with the aid of effluent means which are not very expensive and which can be easily adjusted, said effluent means comprises in accordance with the invention a tubular sheath 23, inside which is telescopically arranged a level adjustable common outlet conduit 24 which can be withdrawn into said tubular sheath and be brought out thereof to a considerable distance below the vessel 1 respectively, and which is connected with coupled conduits 16, 19, 18 of more than one siphon 12.
