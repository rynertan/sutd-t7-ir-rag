## Description
SELF GUIDING TYPE MEDICAL VASCULAR CATHETER This invention relates to a self guiding type multipurpose medical vascular catheter, viz, a medical vascular catheter capable of guiding its tip by itself to peripheral blood vessels in the affected parts of a living body for withdrawal of blood and other specimens from the affected parts, or for infusion of a drug solution to the affected parts. A medical vascular guide wire has a function for aiding the insertion of a catheter into peripheral blood vessels in the affected parts. When the guide wire is used in combination with the catheter, first, the guide wire is inserted into the blood vessels. When the guide wire reaches the peripheral blood vessels in the affected parts, the catheter is inserted into the blood vessels so that the catheter sheathes the guide wire and then, the guide wire is withdrawn therefrom leaving the catheter.Thereafter, a drug solution is infused through the catheter to the affected parts. Most conventional guide wires are coil form metal wires, such as stainless steel wires, supplied by, for example, COOK Inc., Universal Medical Instrument Corp. andUSCI, a division of C.R. Bard, Inc. Most conventional catheters are made of synthetic resin tubes and supplied by, for example, Universal Medical Instrument Corp.,Electro Catheter Corp. and USCI, a division of C.R. Bard, Inc. The above mentioned coiled metal guide wires have some disadvantages. Firstly, the coiled metal wires possess an uneven surface and hence thrombi are liable to be deposited thereon. Secondly, the metal wires are too rigid to permit their tips to reach the blood vessels in the affected parts without causing undue strain or pain to the patient, or taking a great deal of time. Thirdly, the coiled metal wires are not easy to manipulate so that it is sometimes difficult for their tips to reach the affected parts. Fourthly, there is a danger that the coiled metal wires may injure the intimae of blood vessels.The above mentioned catheters also have some disadvantages.Firstly, the catheters are larger in diameter than the guide wires and therefore, it is difficult for the catheter tip to reach the intended location, particularly in peripheral blood vessels, where the guide wire has reached.Furthermore, it is generally difficult to accomplish the catheterization without causing undue strain or pain to the patient. Secondly, in the process of catheterization, many kinds of catheters and guide wires must be used in combination. Thus the procedure requires a substantially long period of time. A primary object of the present invention is to provide a self guiding type medical vascular catheter capable of guiding its tip by itself to the peripheral blood vessels, which can be easily and freely manipulated for permitting its tip part to reach the peripheral blood vessels without restraint. Another object of the present invention is to provide a self guiding type medical vascular catheter having a smooth surface on which thrombi are deposited only to a slight extent, and which catheter is sufficiently flexible for permitting its tip part to reach peripheral blood vessels in the affected parts without undue strain to the patient or taking a great deal of time and further without injury to the intimae of blood vessels. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a self guiding type medical vascular catheter comprising a continuously extending body made of a synthetic resin hollow monofilament and comprising a tip part, a relatively flexible part having a smaller diameter than the other parts, a tapering part and a manipulating part, these four parts continuously forming a line, in that order, along the monofilament axis said body having a hollow extending at least from one end of the manipulating part to the tapering part or to the other end of the manipulating part or to a point in close proximity to said other end of the manipulating part, said hollow having an X ray impermeable metal inserted therein at least in the manipulating part, and said hollow having a diameter larger than that of the Xray impermeable metal so that there is formed a space within the hollow, said space forming a lumen for permitting a liquid and or a gas to pass therethrough, which lumen is opened to the outside of the body through an inlet opening at the distal end of the manipulating part and through an outlet opening bored in the tip part, the relatively flexible part, the tapering part, or the other end of the manipulating part or at a point in close proximity thereto and said body further having a hollow in the tip part having an X ray impermeable metal inserted therein. In the drawings Fig. 1A is an enlarged longitudinal sectional. view illustrating one example of a self guiding type catheter of the invention and Fig. 13 is an enlarged transverse sectional view taken along the line A A in Fig. 1. Referring to Figs. 1A and 1B, self guiding type catheter 1 is made of a synthetic resin monofilament having a hollow 2 extending along the monofilament axis.The catheter 1 is comprised of a tip part 4, a relatively flexible part 5 which is hereinafter referred to as flexible part for brevity a tapering part 6 and a manipulating part 8. These four parts continuously form a line, in that order, along the monofilament axis. The tip part 4 is of a hollow structure and hasX ray impermeable metal 9 inserted therein. The shape of the tip part 4 is not particularly limited but may preferably be spherical, oval spherical or end rounded cylindrical. The size of the tip part 4 is preferably about 0.5 3 mm, more preferably about 0.7 2 mm, in maximum diameter, and preferably about 0.5 5 mm, more preferably about 0.7 4 mm, in length. The flexible part 5 may be either hollow or solid and possesses a substantially uniform diameter over its entire length. The size of the flexible part 5 is preferably about 0.1 0.5 mm, more preferably about 0.15 0.4 mm, in diameter, and preferably about 10 100 mm, more preferably about 20 70 mm, in length.The flexible part 5 possesses a smaller diameter, and is more flexible and pliable than the other parts, and furthermore, is sufficiently strong to prevent the catheter from being broken between the tip part 4 and the flexible part 5. The tapering part 6 tapers from its end adjacent to the manipulating part 8 toward the flexible part 5.The size of the tapering part 6 is preferably about 10 100 mm, more preferably about 20 70 mm, in length.Although there may be no clear demarcation between the tapering part 6 and the flexible part 5, the total length of these two parts should preferably be not greater than 200 mm. The tapering part 6 may be either hollow or solid. It is, however, preferable that the tapering part 6 be hollow and have an X ray impermeable metal inserted therein. The manipulating part 8 is of a hollow monofilament structure. Its diameter is preferably about 0.7 3 mm, more preferably about 0.7 2 mm. Its length should be at least about 200 cm, preferably 50 200 cm and more preferably 70 150 cm. The manipulating part 8 has an Xray impermeable metal 9, in the form of a wire of about 0.2 0.4 mm in diameter, inserted in the hollow thereof.Therefore, the manipulating part 8 possesses not only a high stiffness but also a suitable degree of rigidity as well as a suitable degree of flexibility and elasticity, and this part of the catheter can be easily and freely manipulated for permitting the tip part of the catheter to reach the peripheral blood vessels without restraint. The above mentioned numerical values for the size of the self guiding type catheter are mere exemplifications and it should be understood that the size of the catheter is not particularly limited to such values. These sizes may be suitably varied depending upon, for example, the age and the physical condition of the patient or the state of the parts for which treatment is intended. The body of the self guiding type catheter 1 has a hollow 2 extending at least from one end of the manipulating part 8 to the tapering part 6 or to the other end of the manipulating part 8 or to a point in close proximity to said other end of the manipulating part. The follow 2 has a diameter larger than that of an X ray impermeable metal 9 inserted therein over substantially the entire length of the hollow, and therefore, a lumen defined by a space 2 is formed within the hollow 2. In general, it is preferable that the diameter of the hollow 2 is as large as possible. This space 2 forms a lumen for permitting a liquid and or a gas, such as a drug solution, to pass therethrough. The lumen is opened to the outside of the body of the catheter 1 through an inlet opening 10 at the distal end of the lumen and through an outlet opening 7.The outlet opening 7 is bored preferably in the tapering part 6 as illustrated in Fig. 1A. However, in the case where the flexible part 5 is hollow and has a relatively large diameter, the outlet opening 7 may be bored in the flexible part 5 or the tip part 4. The outlet opening 7 preferably has a sectional shape, as shown inFig. 1A, such that the section becomes broader toward the outside of the catheter body so as to avoid the undesirable retention of a drug solution. The lumen defined by the space 2 is usually sterilized. The X ray impermeable or radio opaque metal is inserted at least in the tip part and the manipulating part of the catheter, so that the catheter cm be monitored from the outside of the patient s body during the introduction of the catheter into blood vessels. The X ray impermeable metal 9 inserted in the hollow 2 preferably possesses a diameter corresponding to 20 80 of the diameter of the hollow 2. As the X ray impermeable metal, a tungsten wire is preferably used because of its high radio opacity. In view of the possible reactivity of theX ray impermeable metal with a drug solution, it is preferable that the X ray impermeable metal is coated with a resin such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate or a fluorine containing resin. Furthermore, the X ray impermeable metal wire is preferably tapered at one end portion thereof toward the tip part 4.The tapered metal wire exhibits an enhanced flexibility, as compared with a non tapered metal wire, and thus, the catheter can be more unrestrictedly moved in blood vessels and more easily manipulated. Moreoever, the tapered metal wire permits a drug solution to pass through the lumen more smoothly. The inlet opening 10 at the distal end of the lumen preferably has a diameter smaller than that of the X ray permeable metal wire 9 so that the metal wire 9 does not come out through the inlet opening 10. The inlet opening 10 may be capped when the catheter is not applied.Furthermore, the end portion of the monofilament body, having the inlet opening 10, may preferably be of a structure such that a connector or an injector can be connected thereto. The multi purpose medical vascular catheter of the invention may be made of any melt extrudable thermoplastic synthetic resins. The thermoplastic synthetic resins used include, for example, polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate polyamides, such as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610, nylon ll, nylon 12, and nylon 6 66 polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene and, fluorine containing resins, such as copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with hexafluoropropylene. These thermoplastic synthetic resins may be used either alone or in combination. The medical vascular catheter of the invention may be manufactured as follows. A thermoplastic synthetic resin is melt extruded through an annular orifice of a spinneret provided in an extruder, to obtain an undrawn or slightly drawn continuous hollow monofilament. The continuous hollow monofilament is cut into predetermined lengths. A limited portion of the entire length of each hollow monofilament, which portion is adjacent to one end portion thereof, is drawn several times its original length, whereby a relatively flexible part 5 and a tapering part 6 are simultaneously formed. X ray impermeable metal 9 is inserted into the hollow of the undrawn or slightly drawn end portion thereof and then, its open end is heat sealed to form the tip part 4.X ray impermeable metal 9 is also inserted into the continuously extending hollow of the manipulating part 8 from the end thereof opposite to the tip part 4 and then the open end is heated so that the inlet opening is narrowed. As hereinbefore mentioned, the X ray impermeable metal wire is tapered at one end thereof prior to its insertion into the hollow of the monofilament body. The tapered metal wire exhibits an enhanced flexibility and the catheter can be more unrestrictedly moved in blood vessels and more easily manipulated. 1 Then, an outlet opening 7 Fig.lA is drilled through the wall of the tapering part by using a fine drill. The end portion of the monofilament body, which has an inlet opening 10 Fig. 1A , may be provided with a cap or an adaptor to connect the catheter with an infusion pump. The hollow monofilament body of the catheter of the invention can be surface treated in order to enhance its self lubricating property and thus, to minimize the thrombus deposition and to make the manipulation of the catheter very easy. The surface treatment employed includes i a silicone treatment, ii a fluorine containing resin coating treatment or iii a plasma spark discharge treatment. These surface treatments can be effected as follows. i Silicon coating treatment A hollow monofilament body is passed several times through a bath of a solution of a medical silicone dissolved in, for example, isopropanol, and then the so coated monofilament body is dried under reduced pressure, thereby removing the solvent therefrom. Prior to the silicone coating treatment, the monofilament body may be surface treated with sandpaper in order to facilitate the silicone coating treatment. ii Fluorine containing resin coating treatment A hollow monofilament body is treated with a solution of a fluorine containing resin, such as tTeflon 30 J trade name, an aqueous suspension containing about 60 weight of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene having a particle size of about 0.3 micron, supplied by Mitsui Fluorochemical Co. and Teflon D l trade name, an aqueous suspension of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene, supplied by Daikin Kogyo K.K. .The treating procedure may be similar to that explained above with regard to the silicone coating treatment. iii Plasma spark discharge treatment A hollow monofilament body is placed in a chamber which is maintained at a reduced pressure of below about 1 mmHg and into which a small amount of a gaseous organic fluorocompound is introduced. Then, a plasma spark discharge is effected, thereby introducing fluorine substituents into the polymer forming the surface of the mono filament. The advantages of the self guiding type medical vascular catheter will be explained. When the catheter is inserted in blood vessels, the tip part 4 is capable of drifting in the blood stream and thus, freely moving in blood vessels in response to delicate manipulation even in the case where the blood vessels wind and curve. The tip part does not penetrate into intimae of blood vessels.Thus, the tip part 4 reaches the affected parts without even a slight strain being caused on the patient, and there is no risk of injuring the intimae of blood vessels.This is in a striking contrast to conventional metal guide wires, which must be forced into blood vessels. As the, tip part 4 has an X ray impermeable metal inserted in the hollow thereof, the tip part 4 can be easily monitored by an X ray projection. The flexible part 5 permits the free movement of the tip part 4 in blood vessels. The tapering part 6 can prevent unusual retention of blood and also, ensures the unrestricted manipulation of the catheter. Thus, a highly skilled and delicate manipulation of the catheter can be easily effected, which manipulation is required for advancing the catheter into the intended blood vessel branch at a turning point. The flexibility and pliability of the tapering part 6 are enhanced by the fact that one end portion of the X ray permeable metal inserted in the taper part 6 or the extended hollow part from tapering part 6 to manipulating part 8 is formed taperingly.Aforesaid tip part 4, flexible part 5 and tapering part 6 render the catheter so flexible and pliable as not to penetrate into even bean curd. Therefore, the injury of the intimae of blood vessels and undue strain on the patient can be remarkably reduced. The manipulating part 8 which is made of the synthetic resin monofilament has a smooth surface and therefore, thrombi are deposited thereon only to a slight extent. Furthermore, the manipulating part 8 has an X ray impermeable metal inserted therein through its entire length therefore, this part is not only easily manipulated but also can be monitored easily. After the tip part of the catheter has been guided to the intended affected parts, if a drug solution is introduced and supplied under pressure from the inlet opening 10 on the rear end of the lumen 21, the drug solution can effectively be supplied from the outlet opening 7 to the affected parts and a high medical effect can be attained. Furthermore, since the drug solution is selectively supplied to the affected parts alone, the intended medical treatment can be accomplished with use of a reduced amount of the drug solution and a risk of side effects can be reduced. The self guiding type catheter of the present invention can act both as a guide wire and as a catheter.Accordingly, the medical treatment implement can be simplified and the treatment time can be shortened. The catheter of the present invention is very valuable for medical treatment utilizing the ultra selective catheterizing technique. The catheter can be used for sampling blood from the affected parts. It can also be used for monitoring the blood pressure by intruding a liquid or gas into the catheter. Furthermore, the catheter can be used as a so called indwelling catheter which is inserted in a blood vessel and left therein for intermittent infusion of a drug solution. The invention will now be illustrated by the following example.EXAMPLE A hollow monofilament having a diameter of 0.8 mm and a hollow diameter of 0.35 mm was prepared from poly ethylene terephthalate according to the conventional meltspinning method using a ring spinneret, and the hollow monofilament was cut into a length of 1.5 m. One end portion of the cut monofilament was locally drawn at a draw ratio of about 3 except a part of about 3 mm to be formed into a spherical tip part, whereby a flexible part having a diameter of 0.3 mm and a length of 50 mm and a tapering part having a length of 30 mm were formed simultaneously. A tungsten piece having a diameter of 0.3 mm and a length of 1 mm was inserted into the top end part to be formed into a spherical tip part and the open hole was melt sealed.A top tapered tungsten wire having a diameter of 0.25 mm and length of 1.3 m was inserted from the rear end into the hollow portion of the tapering part of the catheter, in a manner such that the tapered top part of the tungsten wire was directed towards the spherical tip part. Then, the rear end portion was heated so that the opening size was reduced to obtain a catheter having a hollow extending from the rear end to the tapering part and which has the tungsten wire inserted therein.A small opening having a diameter of 0.25 mm was formed from the outside on the shoulder of the tapered part whereby a drug solution discharge opening was formed. The so obtained catheter having a structure as shown in Fig. 1 was used in clinical examination in which the catheter was advanced from the abdominal aorta through the coeliac artery to the hepatic artery. Both the images of the spherical part and the tapering part produced under irradiation with X rays were clear and their positions could easily be monitored. The top end portion of the catheter could easily be guided to the intended affected part of the liver only by handling the manipulating part. When a drug solution was supplied into the lumen in advance and the solution was forced by a precision metering pump connected to the drug solution inlet opening on the rear end, the drug solution could be supplied selectively to the affected part. This medical treatment required only about 1 5 of the treatment time necessary in the conventional method using a metal guide wire and a catheter in combination, and the pain given to a patient could remarkably be reduced. After the treatment, the catheter could easily be withdrawn, and the withdrawn catheter could easily be cleaned by wiping it with gauze and deposition of thrombi was hardly observed.
