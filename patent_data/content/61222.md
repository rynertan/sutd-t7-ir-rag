## Description
Solar collector . The invention relates to a solar collector comprising one or more elongate, plate shaped absorbers, which or each of which is in heat exchanging contact with a pipe which contains a heat transport medium which discharges the heat which is incident on the absorber or respective absorber, the or each absorber being enveloped by an evacuated, transparent envelope having a circular cross section, there being arranged on one side of the or each absorber, outside the envelpe, a reflector which consists of two parts which contact the envelope along a common generatrix. The invention has for its object to provide an improved solar collector which has a small depth, which ensures that all intercepted solar radiation is incident on the absorber plate either directly or via only one reflection, and which enables optimum interception of solar radiation with a comparatively cheap construction. In order to achieve this object, the solar collector in accordance with the invention is characterized in that each of the reflector parts has the form of part of the cylindrical surface of a circular cylinder and has a centre of curvature which is situated at least substantially on the circumference of the envelope or respective envelope, and in that 0.8 b 4 R 4 b and 0.7 b 4 d 4 1.2 b, where R the radius of curvature of each of the reflector parts, d the distance between the centre line of the or each envelope and the edge of each of the associated reflector parts, b the diameter of the or each envelope. A reflector is thus obtained which is very shallow, and which has a large interception angle for solar radiation, the intercepted solar radiation being incident on the rear of the absorber after only one reflection. An optimum compromise can thus be achieved between cost of construction and yield. The invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings which show by way of example a solar collector in accordance with the invention. Figures 1 and 2 are a diagrammatic sectional view and plan view, respectively, of a solar collector. The reference numeral 1 in the drawing denotes a backing on which there is arranged a solar collector which comprises a number of transparent tubes 5 of circular crosssection, each of which accommodates an elongate absorber plate 7 which is provided on both sides with a black absorption layer. The absorber plate 7 is heat conductively connected to a heat pipe 9 which extends to the exterior of the tube 5, where it can exchange heat, via its condenser 11, with a medium to be heated in a duct 13. In order to prevent heat losses frcm the absorber plate 7 to the environment, a sub atmospheric pressure prevails inside the envelope 5. Underneath each of the envelopes 5 there is arranged a reflector which consists of two shell parts 15 and 17 each of which has the form of part of the cylindrical surface of a circular cylinder and has a centre of curvature which is situated on or substantially on the envelope 5 at the area 19. The shell parts 15 and 17 contact the envelope along a common generatrix of the envelope at the area 21. The radius of curvature R of the shell parts has a dimension between b and 0.8 b, b being the diameter of the envelope 5. The dimension d of the shell parts 15 and 17 in a direction extending transversely of the centre line of the envelope 5 is between 0.7 b and 1.2 b, b again being the diameter of the envelope 5. When these dimensions are used, a collector is obtained which collects the incident solar radiation on the absorber plate for a very large part either directly or after only one reflection, without being excessively deep and with a reasonable distance between the absorbers. In a practical embodiment of a suitably operating solar collector, the diameter of the envelope the width of the absorber amounted to 65 mm. The radius of curvature R of the reflector parts amounted to 52 mm and the dimension d of the reflector shells in the transverse direction amounted to 52 mm.
