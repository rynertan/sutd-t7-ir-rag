## Description
Antibacterial Compounds, Processes For Their Preparation and Compositions Containing Them This invention relates to antibacterial compounds and in particular to a class of esters which have antibacterial activity against certain Gram positive andGram negative organisms, and also possess anti mycoplasmal activity. The compounds are therefore of value in the treatment of human and veterinary infections. The compounds of formula I and salts and esters thereof EMI1.1 wherein Y representsEMI1.2 andEMI1.3 are disclosed in West Germany Offenlegungsschriftn No. 2726619, 2726618 and 2848687 and European Patent Application No. 79300371.6. Compounds of formula I having the tri substituted double bond in the E configuration are referred to as monic acid C, monic acid A and monic acid B.respectively. We have now found a small group of cyano esters of the compounds of formula I which have particularly good antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides an ester of formula II EMI2.1 wherein Y is as defined with respect to formula I andR1 represents hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group and R2 is hydrogen or cyano. Preferably the compounds of formula II are derivatives of monic acid A or C, i.e. Y representsEMI2.2 Suitably, R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group.When R2 is hydrogen the cyano group may be in any position on the aromatic ring, but a preferred position is the mposition. When R2 is cyano the cyano groups may be in any position on the aromatic ring but preferably they are in the two m positions. The compounds II of this invention incorporate a tri substitteddouble bond and may therefore exist in both the E natural and Z or iso geometrical forms. It is to be understood that both geometrical isomers of the compounds of formula II are included within the scope of this invention, as well as mixtures of the two isomers.However, because in general the E isomer of a particular derivative of compound II has the greater activity, it is preferable to employ that isomer. In addition the 10, 11 double bond in the C series of compounds is naturally E in configuration. Compounds of this invention have antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity, and are therefore of value in the treatment of bacterial and mycoplasma induced human and veterinary diseases. The infections against which compounds of this invention are particularly useful include venereal disease. They are also effective in the treatment of respiratory infections such as bacterial bronchitis and bacterial meningitis, non specific urethritis and pneumonia. In animals it may be employed for the treatment of mastitis in cattle, for swine dysentery, and for mycoplasma infections in animals such as turkeys, chickens, pigs and cattle. Some of the human and veterinary diseases either caused by mycoplasma species or in which they play a prominent role, and against which compounds of this invention are effective, are as follows Avian M gallisepticum Chronic respiratory diseases air sacculitis of chickens and turkeysBovine M bovis Mastitis, respiratory disease and arthritis of cattle M dispar Calf pneumonia Porcine M suipneumoniae Enzootic pneumonia of pigs M hyorhinis M hyosynoviae arthritis in pigsHuman M pneumoniae primary atypical pneumonia Compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in the treatment of enzootic pneumonia in animals such as pigs, cattle and sheep, because they also have activity against the bacteria Bordetelia bronchispetica,Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus spp, which often cause respiratory complications in cases of this disease. This invention also provides a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition which comprises a compound of formula II together with a pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable carrier or excipient. The compositions may be formulated for administration by any route, and would depend on the disease being treated. The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, liquid or gel preparations, such as oral, topical or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinyl pyrollidone fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica disintegrants, for example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For topical application to the skin compounds of this invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for compounds of formula II are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry s Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books, and the British Pharmacopoeia. Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, eg cocoa butters or other glyceride. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and water removed under vacuum. The dry lypophilized powder is then sealed in the vial. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compounds. Veterinary compositions for intramammary treatment of mammary disorders in animals, especially bovine mastitis, will generally contain a suspension of a compound of formula II in an oily vehicle. The compositions may contain from 0.1 to 99 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 mg to 3 g, per day, for instance 250 mg to 2 g, per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. Alternatively a compound of formula II may be administered as part of the total dietary intake. In this case the amount of compound employed may be less than 1 by weight of the diet and in preferably no more than 0.5 by weight. The diet for animals may consist of normal foodstuffs to which the compound may be added or it may be added to a premix. A suitable method of administration of a compound of formula II to animals is to add it to the animals drinking water. In this case a concentration of compound in the drinking water of about 5 500 pg ml, for example 5 200 pg ml, is suitable. Compounds of formula II may be prepared by reacting a cyano benzyl compound of formula III EMI7.1 in which X is a good leaving group, preferably a halogen atom or an alkyl or aryl sulphonate, and R1 and R2 are as defined in formula II with a salt of the acid of formula I , preferably the sodium salt. Preferably,X is a bromine atom or a mesylate group. The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, suitably dimethylformamide, at 200 to 1000C and the resulting product may be purified chromatographically on silica. Compounds of formula II wherein Y representsEMI8.1 may also be prepared from compounds of formula II wherein Y representsEMI8.2 by reaction with a reagent which converts an epoxide to an olef in. Such reactions are described in ourEuropean Patent Applications Nos. 78300530.9 and 79300371.6. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of various compounds of the present invention.
