# Aqueous emulsion of acrylic acid copolymer.

## Abstract
Copolymerisation is carried out in the presence of a radical polymerisation initiator, of an aqueous mixture of, by weight a 60 99.8 of an acrylic acid fluoroalkyl ester deriva tive up to 90 of which may be replaced by an acrylic acid alkyl ester and up to 99 of which may be replaced by a radical poly merisable vinyl monomer b 0.1 20 of an acrylic acid derivative, c 0.1 20 of a polyfunctional monomer causing inter nal cross linking of the copolymer and d optionally 0.001 10 of a vinyl monomer having a sulfonic acid group. The resultant emulsion contains copolymer particles of size 0.03 to 2 Âµm and a specific gravity of 0.9 to 1.5, and it has excellent stability and can be dispersed in a buffer solution or physiological saline solution.
