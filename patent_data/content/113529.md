# Drive control method for stepping motors.

## Abstract
A drive control method for stepping motors in which a rotor is made to repeatedly actuate in a period of the sum of a stationary time after one rotation step and a stationary time after the following one rotation step, in order to enable to obtain substantially smaller angular displacement of the rotor than the predetermined unit rotation angle.
