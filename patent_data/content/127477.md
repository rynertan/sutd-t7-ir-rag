## Description
This invention relates to radiation sensitive compositions, to radiation sensitive devices, in particular radiation sensitive plates for lithographic printing plate production and photo resists comprising substrates coated with such compositions, and to the processing of such radiation sensitive devices. Radiation sensitive devices of the type with which the present invention is concerned conventionally consist of a radiation sensitive composition coated on a suitable substrate. Image wise exposure of the device to radiation using a suitable transparency causes the coating to change its characteristics in the areas struck by radiation so that the coating may be selectively removed from the substrate in the non image areas by application of a suitable developer to leave a printing image or etch resistant area on the substrate. In the case of the so called negative working devices, it is the non radiation struck areas of the coating which are removed. As is well known, it is possible to strengthen printing images or etch resistant areas by baking or burning in in the processed devices at a temperature of 180 degC or above. In the case of some lithographic printing plates, the run length can be extended by 2 or 3 times using such treatment. It is desirable that some indication is provided that the device has been baked and moreover that the device has been sufficiently baked to obtain the maximum effect. DE C 732 754 discloses a method of producing a printing plate having an image layer formed from a polyvinyl compound. The exposed substrate is hardened prior to etching by an essential treatment with ammonium molybdate and subsequent heating. A combination of methylviolet and safranine is used to give colour changes to indicate that the hardening is complete. No other image layer or dyes are disclosed, and no indication is given of the temperature at which the dyes are required to change colour. FR A 2 264 307 discloses a method of producing a photographic image avoiding the use of wet chemicals wherein a heat sensitive dye is incorporated into a photopolymerizable composition. After exposure, the photopolymerizable composition is heated, such that those parts of the composition which were exposed, having thereby different dielectric constants and heat losses, reach the temperature required for the dye to change colour, and the unexposed parts do not, thereby forming a visible image. However, the dyes of the present invention are not disclosed. It is an object of this invention to provide such an indication and this is achieved in accordance with the present invention by baking the developed device in the presence of a heat sensitive dye which undergoes a colour change at a temperature of 180 C or more. The heat sensitive dye may be incorporated in the radiation sensitive composition. Accordingly, the present invention provides a radiation sensitive composition comprising a radiation sensitive material and a heat sensitive cationic, azo dye having a chromophoric resonance conjugation system and a positive charge distributed over the system which dye undergoes a colour change at a temperature of at least 180 C. Any radiation sensitive material may be used in the composition of the present invention. Whilst some compositions may not in themselves benefit from baking, an improvement in the strength of such compositions may be obtained by including, in the compositions, a support resin which does benefit from baking. The radiation sensitive composition may also contain a substance which produces a colour change on exposure to radiation. In the case where the composition is coated onto a substrate to form a radiation sensitive device, the substrate may be, for example, grained and anodised aluminium or other substrate conventionally used in the production of lithographic printing plates or in etching processes. In use of such radiation sensitive devices the radiation sensitive composition is image wise exposed to radiation and then developed to selectively remove the more soluble areas of the composition and reveal the underlying substrate and to leave an image on the substrate constituted by the less soluble areas. Subsequent baking of the developed device is then carried out until the dye in the composition undergoes its colour change. In this way it can readily be ascertained that the developed device has been heated to the required temperature. The actual colours involved will depend upon the particular dye used and upon any colour which the image may inherently have as a consequence of other components of the radiation sensitive composition. A well known disadvantage of baking some radiation sensitive devices is that during the baking step contaminating residues are formed and these become deposited on the background areas i.e. the non image areas of the printing plate or the areas to be etched of the photo resist . This is particularly serious in the case where the device is to be used in the production of a lithographic printing plate as the contaminating residues cause scumming during subsequent printing and render the printing plate useless even if they are present to only a small degree. This problem can be overcome by treating the device with a processing liquid before baking, in accordance with our Thermotect RTM process described in our G.B. Patent No.1513368 whereby a thin coating of a protective substance is applied to the device before baking. This protective substance forms a layer which shields the background areas from the contaminating residues and, as it is water soluble and remains water soluble during the baking step, it and the contaminating residues can be readily washed off with water after the baking step. If desired the heat sensitive dye may be incorporated in such a processing liquid in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a method of forming an image or etch resistant area which comprises image wise exposing a radiation sensitive device comprising a radiation sensitive composition coated on a substrate developing the device to selectively remove the more soluble areas of the composition to reveal the underlying substrate and leave an image or etch resistant area constituted by the less soluble areas coating the developed device with a processing liquid comprising a heat sensitive cationic azo dye which undergoes a colour change at a temperature of at least 180 C and a protective substance to shield the revealed underlying substrate from contaminating residues formed when the developed device is heated to a temperature of at least 180 C heating the coated device until the dye exhibits a colour change and washing the device to remove the coating. The protective substance in the processing liquid may be any one of, or a mixture of, the substances described in G.B. Patents Nos. 1513368, 1534424 and 1555233 or G.B. Patent Application No. 2099371 and it is advantageous for the processing liquid also to contain a film forming agent, for example poly vinyl alcohol . It is particularly preferred for the protective substance to be a surfactant such as sodium dodecyl phenoxy benzene disulphonate, a sodium salt of an alkylated naphthalene sulphonic acid, the disodium salt of methylene dinaphthalene sulphonic acid, sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate, or a sodium salt of a sulphonated alkyl diphenyl oxide. In accordance with the invention, the dye is a delocalised, cationic, azo dye, in which the positive charge in the dye molecule participates in the chromophoric resonance conjugation system of the dye. A particularly preferred dye of this type contains the chromophoric group where X represents CH,CR₂ or N O , S , R, R₁, R₂ and R₃ , which may be the same or different, each represents H, or an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl or heterocyclic group, and rings A and B are optionally substituted and or are optionally fused to aromatic or heterocyclic rings. Another preferred dye of this type contains the chromorphoric group wherein R₄ represents H or an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl or alkoxy group, and G, and I and J taken together, represent the atoms required to complete a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring. G,I, and J may, for example, be carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and or sulphur atoms and the ring may be fused to an optionally substituted ring system. The azo linkage of the above dyes may be connected to the residue of a diazonium compound or to the residue of a coupling component. Examples of dyes containing the group I are These dyes are blueish green in colour and change to red violet on heating to 180 An example of a dye containing the group II is This dye is greenish blue in colour and decolourises on heating to a temperature of at least 180 Dyes containing group III are illustrated by Formulae XXVI to XXVIII. Generally, the radiation sensitive compositions of the present invention will contain up to 20 by weight preferably up to 10 by weight of the dye, based on the weight of the composition. The processing liquids of the present invention will generally contain up to about 1 by weight of dye, depending upon solubility, and up to about 20 by weight of protective substance, based on the total weight of the liquid. The anionic portion of the cationic dyes has little, if any, affect on the properties of the dyes other than their solubility. Any anion may be used, for example chloride, zinc chloride, tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, sulphate, acetate, methyl sulphate, phosphomolybdate, phosphotungstate, phosphotungstomolybdate, or a sulphonate such as p toluene sulphonate, naphthalene sulphonate or trisopropyl naphthalene sulphonate. Chloride and zinc chloride anions are particularly suitable as regards aqueous solubility. Whilst the reason the dyes change colour is not completely understood, it is believed that the azo linkage breaks at elevated temperature to give heat decomposition products which are colourless or of a different colour to the dye. In all the examples of dyes given, the positive charge is shown to be associated with a specific nitrogen atom within the dye molecule. In practice, the positive charge will be spread, or delocalised, over the entire chromophoric structure of the dye. The following Examples illustrate the invention. A positive working radiation sensitive composition was prepared by mixing together The mixture was then made up to 400 ml with 95 5 Acetone Methyl Oxitol. The diazo diphenylamine fluoroborate produces acid on exposure and the acid causes the Sudan Yellow dye to change colour. The composition was split into 3 equal portions A to C and dyes were added as follows to portions B and C The resultant radiation sensitive plates A to C were exposed under a positive transparency on a Berkey Ascor frame for 18 units approx. 36 seconds , giving in the case of Plate A a yellow image area, and in the case of Plates B and C green image areas, against a red background. These colours, and the other colours referred to in this and the other Examples, were as seen under yellow safelight. The plates were dish developed in aqueous alkaline developer for 45 seconds. The developed plates were all treated with a 10 solution of sodium dodecyl phenoxybenzene disulphonate protective substance , then buffed down until dry, and baked in an oven for 10 minutes at 200 degC. The colour of the images of the baked plates was then evaluated. The comparison shows that whereas the image formed from the composition of the invention had a good colour change on baking, the colour change of the image formed from the composition containing the TPM solvent dye for comparison purposes was inadequate. Further samples of plate C were baked for 10 minutes at different temperatures. After baking the following image colours were observed A negative working radiation sensitive composition was prepared from The composition was split into portions D to F and dyes were added to portions E and F as follows Each portion of the composition was whirled into sheets of electrolytically grained, sulphuric acid anodised aluminium to give coating weights of 1.1 gm per sq.m. The coatings were dried at 65 degc for 5 minutes. The resultant plates were image wise exposed under a negative transparency for 25 units on a Berkey Ascor frame, and developed with a solvent developer to give lithographic printing plates having a yellow image Plate D and green images Plates E and F against colourless backgrounds. The plates were treated with an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl phenoxy benzene disulphonate protective substance and baked in an oven for 10 minutes at 200 degC. After baking, the folowing plate colours were observed The comparison shows that whereas the image formed from the composition of the invention had a good colour change on baking, the colour change of the image formed from the composition containing the Microlith Blue A3RK dye for comparison purposes was inadequate. A processing liquid was prepared to the following formulation Water to 100 mls. An exposed and developed plate plate A from Example 1 having a yellow image was treated with this solution, and buffed down to give a plate with an overall greenish blue colouration. The plate was then baked in an oven for 10 minutes at 220 degC whereupon the plate became pale violet in colour in the background areas. The plate was washed with water and inked in. There was no contamination of the background areas. Example 3 was repeated using a plate identical to plate D of Example 2. Similar results were obtained. Examples 1 to 4 were repeated except that an infra red baking apparatus was used instead of a conventional oven. Similar results were obtained. Examples 1 and 2 were repeated using the dyes of formulae V to XXVIII. The resultant colour changes of the image on heating to 200 Example 3 was repeated with the dye replaced by the dyes of Formulae V to XXVIII. The colour change of the background areas occurring on heating to 200 A photopolymerisable composition was prepared from made up to 200 mls with ethyl methyl ketone. The composition was split into 2 equal portions, A and B, and dyes were added as follows Each portion of the composition was whirler coated onto sheets of electrolytically grained and anodised aluminium and dried, to give coating weights of 1 g m ². The dried layers were overcoated with poly vinyl alcohol to prevent oxygen inhibition. The resultant radiation sensitive plates were exposed under a negative transparency on a Berkey Ascor printing down frame for 5 units approx. 10 seconds . In the case of each plate, a red colouration was produced in the image areas, against a green background. The plates were hand developed in alkaline surfactant solution for 30 seconds, giving dark green image areas against a white background. The plates were treated with an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl phenoxy benzene disulphonate protective substance and baked in an oven for 10 minutes at 200 In most cases the colour changes would be similar when viewed under white light. Although some would be different, the change would still be discernible. Thus the dye of Formula VIII in Example 2 would change from violet to yellow brown.
