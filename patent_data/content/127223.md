# Semiconductor device.

## Abstract
The invention discloses a compact construction of an n channel surface MOS source follower in a p pocket in an n type substrate. The source is connected to the p pocket in order to avoid feedback. The drain is connected to the subs trate which acts as a supply line. This construction permits manufacturing several output amplifiers with a minimum pitch. The invention is of particular importance for CCD sen sors.
