## Description
MOLDING COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic compositions containing terephthal ate resins have become increasingly significant as extrusion and molding compositions. The exploitation of such polyester compositions as molding resins was initially retarded because of drawbacks of its most widely available member poly ethylene terephthalate . Because this polyester crystallizes very slowly, molded articles are dimensionally unstable after removal from the mold unless unattractively long mold cycles and high mold temperatures are employed. Poly butylene terephthalate is a rapidly crystallizing polyester and is highly suited for injection molding and extrusion applications. Blends of PBT with PET, as described in U.S. 3,953,394 of Fox et al. are also molding compositions useful at low molding temperatures and rapid cycles times. Other terephthalate resin compositions contain ing modifier polymers have also proven superior. Thus, inU.S. Patent No. 3,937,757 of Seydl et al., it is disclosed that from 5 to 20 by weight of polyolefin will increase the tracking resistance of a poly butylene terephthalate composition. Similarly, U.S. Patent 4,267,286 of Campbell describes an impact modifier for use with poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resin or polyester copolymers. That modifier is a combination of polyacrylate resin or a vinyl aromatic diene block copolymer resin with a poly l,3 butylene terephthalate which includes units derived from 2 methyl 1, 3 propanediol. Notwithstanding these discoveries, further improve ment of terephthalate resin molding compositions remains desirable. In particular, enhancement of the appearance of readily producible molded articles is sought. Introduction to the Invention An improved poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate molding composition is provided.An amount of from I to tOl of poly 2 methyl l ,3 propylene terephthalate modifier is incorporated into the composition.This modifier provides a desirable increase in the surface gloss of molded articles prepared with this composition. Descrlctin to the Invention Terephthalate resins are available commercially or can be prepared by techniques such as the alcoholysis of esters of terephthalic acid with a diol and subsequent polymerization, as heating a glycol with the free acid or with a halide derivative thereof, and similar cor.ventional processes. These polyesters are desirably of high molecular weight and have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.6 deciliters gram for poly ethylene terephthalate and preferably at least 0.8 deciliters gram, for PBT as measured in a 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane mixture at 30 OC, The poly l,4 butylene terephthalate fording the resin base for the present compositions may include a small amount e.g. up to S mole percent based on the terephthalate units of a branching component containing at least three ester forming groups. These branched resins are especially useful when high melt strength is important. The branching component can be one which provides branching in the acid unit portion of the polyester or in the glycol unit portion. It can also be a hybrid. Illustrative of such branching components are tri or tetracarboxylic acids, such as trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid, and lower alkyl esters thereof, and the like or preferably, polyols and especially preferably, tetrols, such as penta erythritol, triols, such as tri methyloipropane, or dihydroxy carboxylic acids and hydroxydicarboxylic acids and derivatives, such as 2,2 bis hydroxymethyl propionic acid, and the like. Suitable branched poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins and their preparation are described inU.S.Patent 3,953,404 of 3orman. The copolyesters, suitably described by Borman et al. in German Offen, 2,756,167 may also find application as a component in the resin base of the subject invention. By the term resin base it is meant that the poly l,4 butylene terephthalate forms a significant portion of the present compositions. This portion is ordinarily at least 30 by weight of the total composition. The poly 2 methyl 1,3 propylene terephthalate resins of the present invention can be made in known ways, for example by one of the procedures outlined above, but substituting a 2 methyl l,3 butylene glycol or a reactive derivative thereof. The amount of the poly Z methyl l ,3 propylene terephthalate modifier may range from 1 to 20 by weight of the poly butylene terephthalate resin base of the compo sition. Preferably, it is from 2 to 15 of such weight.Such amounts have been found to provide an improved appearance for mold articles, most particularly by provision of enhanced surf ace gloss. This amount of poly 2 mqthyl l,3 propylene terephthalate also does not significantly affect the crystal lization rate s of other resins which may be present. Thus, the poly 2 methyl l, 3 propylene terephthalate appears to act as an amorphous phase extender which does not interere with the desirable properties of the resin base or of other constituent s of the composition. The present compositions may, in addition to the poly 2 methyl 1,3 propylene terephthalate modifier, consist essentially of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate .Alternatively, however, an auxiliary thermoplastic polymer or resin i.e. a polymer other than one of the foregoing terephthalates may be incorporated into these compositions for the purposes fox which are already known. Optional auxiliary resins include the poly ethylene terephthalateX, polyolefins, and other resins discussed above. In addition, rubbers or other impact modifiers provide optional additives. Similarly nylons, polyphenylene ether and the like may be incorporated into the present compositions. Preferably, however, the poly l,4 butylene terephthalate base resin remains a major constituent of the composition. It will ordinarily comprise at least from 30 to 80 , more preferably from 50 to 80 by weight of the total composition. Within the foregoing parameters, the present composition may contain other conventional ingredients.In certain preferred embodiments, for example, the composition will include filler, especially reinforcing filler such as fibrous filamentous glass, or mineral fillers, such as clay, mica, talc and the like, preferably clay.The fillers can be untreated or treated with silane or coupling agents, etc. Similarly, the compositions may contain an ef√®ct ve amount of a conventlonal flame retardant agent. As is well known, flare retardants can be based on elementary red phosphorus, phosphorus compounds, halogen and nitrogen compounds alone or preferably in further combination with synergists, such as antimony compounds. Especially useful are polymeric and oligomeric flame retardant agents compris ing tetrabromobisphenol A carbonate units, see, for example,U.S. Patent 3,833,685 of Wambach and U S. Patent No. 3,855,277 of Fox. Other ingredients, such as dyes, pigments, drip retardants, and the like can also be added for their conventionally employed purposes. Such optional ingredients including those discussed in greater detail above, may be present in any amount up to about 70 by weight. However, amounts of from about 10 to 50 by weight of the total composition are preferred. The compositions of this intention can be prepared by any number of procedures. In one way, the resin base, poly I,4 butylene terephthalate , and any optional ingredients are put into an extrusion compounder to produce molding pellets. In another procedure, the modifier is mixed with the other ingredients by dry blending, then either fluxed on a mill and comminuted, or then are extruded and chopped.The modifier can also be mixed with the other ingredients and directly molded, e.g., by injection or transfer molding techniques. It is always important to thoroughly free all of the ingredients poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins, modifier if used, and any optional, conventional additives, from as much water as possible. In addition, compounding is desirably carried out to ensure that the residence time in the machine is short the temperature is carefully controlled the friction heat is utilized and an intimate blend is obtained. Although it is not essential, best results are ordinarily obtained if the ingredients are pre compounded, pelletized and then molded. Pre compounding can be carried out in conventional equipment. For example, after carefully pre drying the polyester and modifier and the reinforcing agent, or filler, for example, for four hours at 1200C., a single screw extruder is fed with a dry blend of the ingred ients, the screw employed having a long transition section to ensure proper melting. On the other hand, a twin screw extrusion machine, e.g., a 53 mm Werner Pfleiderer machine, can be fed with resin and additives at the feed port and reinforcement donwstream. In either case, a generally suitable machine temperature will be about 230 to 3000C. The pre compounded composition can be extruded and cut up into molding compounds such as conventional granules, pellets etc., by standard techniques. The composition can be molded in any equipment conventionally used for thermoplastic compositions, e.g., a Van Dorn type injection molding machine with conventional cylinder temperatures, e.g., 230 2800C. and conventional mold temperatures, e.g., 550 1000C. The following example are given by way of illustration only and are not intended as a limitation on the scope of this invention. Many variations are possible without departing from its spirit and scope.Unless otherwise specified herein all proportions are provided on a weight basis. EXAMPLE 1 Sample molding compositions of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate containing various amounts of poly 2 methyl 1,3 propylene terephthalate modifier are prepared by coextrusion in a standard plastic extruder. Testing of these samples reveals that their physical properties, including moldability and crystallization rates, are substantially uniform. The appearances of molded articles produced from them, however, differ as follows SAMPLE NO.

The crystallization rates of the blends were measured at 150of.using the method of depolarized light microscopy. Surprisingly, even the presence of 10 of the amorphous additive did not affect the crystallization rates of the blends.
