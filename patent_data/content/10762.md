# Apparatus for generating electric signals simulating the output of a device for measuring a physical variable.

## Abstract
An apparatus generates an electric signal to simulate the output of a measuring apparatus, such as a thermocou ple, which is sensitive to a physical variable, such as tem perature, and which provides an output electric signal. The apparatus comprises a selector 11 for choosing the par ticular type of thermocouple to be simulated, a measuring unit selector 12 to select the temperature scale to be utilised, a selector 13 in the form of keyboard for selecting the value of the temperature the measurement of which is to be simulated and a computer circuit 14 which includes a memory containing information concerning the type of measuring apparatus that can be selected, and a converter 15 controlled by the computer to supply a simulated out put signal to output terminals 6 .
