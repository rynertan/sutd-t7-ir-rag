## Abstract
A bolus for administering a biologically active material for example an insecticide into a liquid environment such as the water of a reservoir or lake or an anthelmintic into the rumen juices of an animal comprises a succession of liquid impermeable outer segments 153, 263 enclosing a core which in the simplest case may be a single unitary active material segment 151, Figure 14 or in a developed embodi ment may comprise a succession of annular segments 269, Figure 25 contained in sealed recesses 267 in the outer segments 263 which are located on a degradable central rod 265 e.g. of magnesium alloy, which itself will be active for instance to combat magnesium deficiency. As shown in Figure 25, the device may incorporate a weight 275 which, in animal use, inhabits regurgitation. Additionally, the device may include a galvanic couple element which, with the rod 265 sets up a galvanic action which controls the speed of degradation of the rod 265 and thereby the rate of administration of the segments 26 .
