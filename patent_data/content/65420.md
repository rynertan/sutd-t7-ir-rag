# Alternating potential electrostatic separator of particles with different physical properties.

## Abstract
The separator charges the particles to be separated and passes them through an alternating electric field which has a non uniform intensity in a direction perpendicular to the forward direction, and which also has field lines curved in the same direction. The particles which move along the curved field lines due to their charge are thus subjected to a centrifugal force which effects their separation. The separator includes a pair of conductive electrodes, the first being substantially horizontal or possibly at an angle from the horizontal and the second mounted facing the first at a predetermined angle to it. The electrodes may be planar or curved. The field is supplied by an ac source operating in the range of 3 to 1000 hz. A mechanical vibrator attached to the first electrode lmparts the forward motion to the parti cles.
