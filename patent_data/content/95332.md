# Position determination apparatus.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic induction type position determina tion apparatus comprises an interface plate 11 having plural conductors 1 installed thereon in the form of a matrix with specified spaces in X and Y directions a control means 13,12a,12b,19,20 for supplying two currents to two conduc tors 1 in the same direction out of said plural conductors, which comprises a current source 17,16,14 for producing a current a selection means 13,12a,12b coupled to said current source for selecting said two conductors in the same direction out of said plural conductors and supplying said two currents to the selected two conductors and a scanning means 20,18,19 for controlling said current source 17,16,14 and for giving address data for selecting said two conductors to said selection means, said two currents applied to said two conductors being so controlled as to be in a predetermined relation to each other a pickup means 2 movably positioned on said interface plate 11 for picking up two induced voltages induced by magnetic fields generated by said two currents flowing through said selected two conductors a detection means 26,27 coupled to said pickup means for detecting a predetermined relation between said two induced voltages and a deriving means 29,24a,24b,23 coupled to said control means 13,12a,12b,19,20 and said detection means 26,27 for deriving current data and said address data when said detection means 26,27 detects said predetermined relation between said two induced voltages, thereby to obtain coordinate data corresponding to the position of said pickup means 2 on said interface plate 11 .
