# Administering of agricultural chemicals in liquid form.

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 administers agricultural chemicals in li quid form to a land. Agricultural chemical 54 is fed from a reservoir 52 to a liquid chemical container 12. Control means 16, for example level control means including a float valve arrangement, controls the inflow of liquid chemical into the container 12 to keep liquid chemical within the container at a constant level. Liquid chemical flows under gravity under a constant hydraulic head via a composite flow line 18 44, 46, 50 and flow restrictors 20 to administering means 22 which deposit it on a land, conveniently in furrows in a seed bed. Flow rate adjustment takes place by selecting suitable flow restrictors 20, or by adjustment of the control means 16 to effect a suitable level hydraulic head , or both.
