# Pneumatic rotary grinding tool.

## Abstract
A pneumatic rotary grinding tool in which the motor unit 15 is displaceable between a rear, operative position and a forward, dislocated position. A safety guard 18 mounted on the tool housing 10 forms an axial support for the motor unit 15 to keep the latter in a rear, operative position, thereby maintaining a seal means 23 25 in active position to prevent supplied pressure air from passing directly from the supply passage 12 to the exhaust passage 35 without energizing the motor unit 15 . When the safety guard 18 is removed the motor unit 15 is dislocated by the air pressure to a forward position in which the seal means 23 25 is rendered inactive and allows supplied pressure air to pass directly from the air supply passage 12 to the exhaust passage 35 .
