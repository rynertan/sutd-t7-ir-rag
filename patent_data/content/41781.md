# INTRUSION DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEM

## Abstract
A self contained intrusion detection and alarm system for doors and other closures comprising a loop antenna 12 , an rf oscillator circuit 14 electrically connected to said antenna, a DC power source E electrically connected to said oscillator circuit 14 , a detection and processing circuit 16 , a memory and inverter circuit 20 connected to said detection and pro cessing circuit, an audio oscillator 22 connected to said memory and inverter circuit, and an audio transducer 28 connected to said audio oscillator. The construction is such that the total electromagnetic field produced at any point a distance of 47,850 F kHz metres equivalent to λ 2π from said antenna does not exceed 15 microvolts per metre.
