# Molecular models.

## Abstract
A molecular model 2 6 of a relatively large molecule or a portion thereof is made up of a series of solid parallel and equidistant cross sections of rigid transparent plastics sheets 2 2,2 7,2 8,2 9 representing space occupied by the atoms in the crystalline state. The adjacent cross sections are generated from x ray crystal spectroscopic data providing crystal coordinates of the large molecules in computer readable form. Computer tapes of such data are used to print out numbered cross sections of the molecule showing coordinate plots of atoms intersecting such cross sections along a preselected axis. These cross sections are duplicated manually in clear rigid plastics sheets and assembled in order using appropriate spacer blocks 2 1 to maintain accurate spacing of the adjacent cross section.
