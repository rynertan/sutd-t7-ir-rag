# ARTIFICIAL FUEL EFFECT GAS FIRES

## Abstract
A radiant fuel support for an artificial fuel effect gas fire 9 in the form of a plaque 1 of refractory material having an upper surface 3 formed with a series of ridges 2 with chan nels 4 there between, the ridges being designed to support artificial fuel elements 12 placed thereon and the channels being designed to receive gas flames impinging on the sur face thereof the support being mounted in an artificial fuel effect gas fire having a series of flame producing means 10 , with each such means being arranged so that a flame 11 therefrom would impinge on the surface of one of the chan nels at a shallow, glancing angle thereto, the artificial fuel elements being arranged on the ridge to bridge the channels bu this means the channels and the undersurfaces of the fuel elements can be heated to incandescence by the flames which would also appear as naked flames above the support and between the fuel elements.
