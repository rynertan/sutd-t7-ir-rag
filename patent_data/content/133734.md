## Description
Description Hard Disc Cartridge ArrangementTechnical Field The present invention relates to a disc cartridge arrangement for a disc drive for information storage and retrieval.Background Art A cartridge arrangement for a disc drive generally comprises a disc which is either flexible or rigid hard and which is coated with a material upon which information can be stored magnetically or optically. A housing is provided about the disc to protect the disc from environmental contamination.The disc is mounted on a hub which is in turn mounted through the housing such that the hub can engage with the spindle of a disc drive unit. The housing includes an aperture for allowing reading and recording heads to have access through the housing to the disc. The housing further includes a door arrangement which closes over the aperture when the cartridge arrangement is not in use to prevent contamination from entering the housing. In designing a cartridge arrangement, there are several considerations which the prior art does not adequately take into account. First, the cartridge must be designed in such a way that the possibility of contaminations entering the housing is minimized. Second, the cartridge must be designed in such a way that the door arrangement, which closes over the aperture when the cartridge arrangement is not in use, can be accurately positioned in an open position so that the door does not interfere with the orderly placement of the read write heads into contact with the disc. Third, the cartridge arrangement must be designed so that the user cannot accidentally or intentionally open the door, potentially contacting the disc and destroying data stored thereon. The present invention takes into consideration these shortcomings of prior cartridge arrangement. Summary of the Invention The present invention is directed to a cartridge with a hard data storage disc, which cartridge is removably insertable into a disc drive and comprises a housing, a hub means for mounting the hard disc to the housing so that the disc is free to rotate with respect to the housing, and wherein said housing defines an aperture for allowing access through the housing to the disc.The cartridge further includes a door means for selectively covering and uncovering the aperture with a first position for covering said aperture and a second position for uncovering the aperture. The cartridge further includes means for selectively locking the door in the first position and means for selectively unlocking the door from the first position and urging the door into a second position. In another aspect of the invention, the means for selectively locking the door includes a recess defined by one of the door means and the housing and a projection defined by the other of the door means and the housing, the projection being received in the recess for locking the door in the first position. In yet another aspect of the invention, the door is biased toward the first position. In still a further aspect of the invention, a cam means is included for urging the projection out of the recess. In still another aspect of the invention, the means for unlocking the door includes a first cam for urging the projection out of the recess and urging the door towards the second position, and a second cam for further urging the door means into the second position. In another aspect of the invention the door includes a cover with an arm projecting.therefrom, the means for selectively locking the door includes a recess defined by one of the arm and the housing, and a projection defined by the other of the arm and the housing, the projection being received in the recess for locking the door in the first position. Further, the means for selectively unlocking the door has a lever and cam arrangement.The lever and cam arrangement is pivotally mounted in the housing, and includes means for engaging the arm The lever and cam arrangement has a first cam means for urging the projection out of said recess and urging said door means towards said second position and a second cam means for further urging said door means into said second position. The lever and cam arrangement, or other means for unlocking the door means may be pivotally mounted to said housing, and such a lever and cam arrangement may include means for engaging the doors arm projecting from a cover. Then there may be a biasing means for biasing said arm engaging means and said door means towards the first position. The cartridge preferably includes means for mounting the hard disc to the said hub means, said mounting means including a hub aperture with a periphery defined by the hard disc and also including means for urging against said periphery. Such urging means include an eccentric, more specifically there may be three eccentric washers and means for urging said eccentric washers into engagement with said periphery of said hub aperture to provide a positive lock. It is desirable to provide means for keeping the said door means from bowing as it moves to the second position. Such keeping means may include a cam mounted in either of said door means or said housing, with said cam being placed into contact with the other one of said door means and said housing 12 as said door means is urged to the second position. In a preferred arrangement the cartridge housing includes first and second substantially parallel planar sides and a peripheral side located between and secured to said first and second planar sides while the said aperture includes a first aperture in said first planar side, a second aperture in said second planar side located substantially in line with said first aperture and a third aperture in said peripheral side, with said first and second apertures communicating with said third aperture. The door means may be substantially U shaped in cross section and include first and second side portions and means for slidably mounting these side portions relative to the first and second parallel planar sides of the housing, and a peripheral portion 32 joining the first and second side portions, which peripheral portion is slidable relative to the peripheral side of the housing.The door means can then define an aperture which can be aligned with the apertures of the housing, Stated differently the cartridge housing may have a substantially planar side 14 and a peripheral side 18 which is at an angle to the planar side 14 while the said aperture includes a first aperture in said planar side and a second aperture in said peripheral side which communicates with said first aperture, and a door and means for slidably disposing the door on said housing so that the door can be slid over the first and second apertures. It is preferable that the cartridge housing should be flexible about hub means for mounting a hard disc to the housing. From the above it can be seen that the present invention solves or ameliorates needs which were brought into focus by the prior art. In other words, the present invention provides a door which, when closed, stays closed to prevent contamination from entering the housing and potentially destroying data.Further, the cover, when the cartridge is inserted into a disc drive, is opened exactly and precisely so that the door does not interfere with the proper movement and placement of the heads relative to the disc. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the invention, Figure 2 is a bottom view of the embodiment ofFigure 1, Figure 3 is a top view of the embodiment ofFigure 1 with a portion thereof broken away, and Figures 4a, 4b are partial cross sectional views of the lever and cam arrangement of the embodiment ofFigure 1. The present invention is related to the invention as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 384 927, which was filed on June 4, 1982, and is assigned to Syouest Technology, the present applicants. It is incorporated by reference herein, for which purpose a copy is being filed with the present application. With reference to the figures and in particular to Fig. 1, a disc cartridge arrangement, with a hard data storage disc, which arrangement is removably insertable into a disc drive, is depicted and designated by the numeral 10. Cartridge 10 includes a housing 12 which is comprised of two substantially planar and parallel upper and lower sides 14 and 16 and a peripheral side 18 which is substantially perpendicular to the upper and lower sides 14 and 16 in a preferred embodiment. Located inside the housing 12 in a preferred embodiment is a hard disc 20 for magnetically storing information.It is to be understood that the disc could incorporate optical or other methods of data storage. The disc 20 is secured to a hub 22 which hub is disposed through housing 12 as will be discussed hereinbelow. The disc cartridge arrangement 10 further includes a door means 24 which allows the reading and recording heads to access the disc 20. Door means 24 includes a door 26 which is substantiallyU shaped in cross section and is slidingly mounted to both the upper and lower sides 14 and 16 and is slidable over the portion of the peripheral side 18 which joins the above portions of the upper and lower sides 14 and 16. Door 26 defines a first side portion 28 which slides over the upper side 14, a second side portion 30 which slides over the lower side 16, and a peripheral portion 32 which joins the first and second portion 28 and 30 and slides relative to peripheral side 18. The door 26 defines an aperture 27 as follows.First and second side portions 28 and 30 define apertures 34 and 36, respectively, which are trapezoidal in shape in a preferred embodiment and which are lined up one above the other. Apertures 34 and 36 communicate with an aperture 38 defined by the peripheral portion 32 of door 26. Door 26 further includes a linkage or arm 40 which is secured to the peripheral portion 32 and which extends from the side of the peripheral portion 32 and engages a lever and cam arrangement 42 which is pivotally mounted to the housing by pin 44. Lever and cam arrangement 42 includes lever 51 and lever 53, a first cam 55 and a second cam 57. The linkage or arm 40 consists of a pin 74 which is received in a slot in the lever 51 so that the lever 51 is capable of opening and closing the door. When,cam and lever arrangement 42 is urged to pivot about pin 44, the linkage 40 is moved to the side, sliding the door 26 towards the cam and lever arrangement 42. A torsion spring 46 is positioned in the housing 12 about pin 44 to cause the lever and cam arrangement 42 to urge the door 26 closed.The torsion spring 46 slips over pin 44 with one leg loaded against lever 53 and the other leg resting on a wall provided in housing 12. The first cam 53 and the second cam 55 both project from lever 53 of the arrangement 42 in the same direction. Cam 55 is located above cam 57 and projects further from lever 53 than does cam 57. The housing 12 defines an aperture 47 which includes a first substantially trapezoidal shaped aperture 48 in the first planar side 14 and a second substantially trapezoidal aperture 50 in the second planar side 16, and an aperture 52 in the peripheral side 18 of the housing which communicates and joins the apertures 48 and 50. The apertures 34, 36 and 38 of the door 26 can be slid into alignment with the apertures 48, 50 and 52 of the housing through the lever and cam arrangement 42 to give the reading and recording heads not shown access to the disc 20 through not only the peripheral side 18, but also through the upper side 14 and the lower side 16. The linkage or arm 40 includes a projection 41 which can be received in a recess 43 defined on an inside surface of the housing 12.When the projection 41 is received in the recess 43, door 26 is locked in a first position so that the door 26 covers the aperture 47 of the housing 12 Fig. 2 . Along with the urging of the door 26 to a second position wherein the aperture 27 is not aligned with the aperture 47, allowing access to the disc, the lever and cam arrangement 42 causes the projection 41 to be urged out of the recess 43. It is to be understood that, alternatively, the.projection 41 can be placed on the internal surface of the housing 12 and recess 43 can be constructed in the linkage 40. Further, a surface 49 is provided for engaging with the linkage 40 at end 71 as the door 26 is urged to the open position in order to keep the door 26 from bowing and thus keeping the door 26 properly aligned. A slot 45 is defined through the lower side 16 of the housing 12. Slot 45 is located directly below cam and lever arrangement 42. Slot 45 is additionally defined by a portion of the peripheral side immediately adjacent to the door 26.Through slot 45, a two step member 59 which can be part of a disc drive, can be introduced to actuate the cam and lever arrangement 42 to open the door 26. The height of this upstanding member 59 from side 16, is lower than the lever 51, thereby allowing lever 51 to pass thereover, so as not to provide interference with lever 51 or with linkage 40 in the fully open condition. Two step member 59 includes a lower first step 61 and a higher second step 63. The lower first step 61 first engages cam 57 and urges projection 41 out of recess 43 and continues to urge the door 26 toward the second position. The second step 63 then engages the second cam 55 to finally position the door 26 in an open position so that the aperture in,the door is aligned with the aperture in the housing 12. Accordingly the door does not interfere with the read write heads not shown of a disc drive. The hub 22 includes a hub clamp 54 as shown in Fig. 2 which is located relative to the lower side 16 of the housing 12. Hub clamp 54 is designed for engaging a spindle not shown of a disc drive and accurately positioning the disc relative to the spindle. In a preferred embodiment the hub clamp includes fingers 56, 58, 60, 62, 64 which extend from equidistant positions about the hub and project inwardly. The fingers act as springs to securely engage the spindle and accurately position the hub 22 on the spindle. The fingers 56, 58, 60, 62 and 64 are designed such that they are always flexed below the flexural fatigue endurance limit of the material when they are pushed apart to accept the spindle. The fingers can be constructed of a variety of metals and plastics, as is well known in the industry.As the fingers are equally spaced about the spindle and each applies the same pressure, the hub clamp 54 arrangement is self centering. The hub 22 includes, in a preferred embodiment, three eccentric cams 80, 82 and 84 on the surface opposite that which has the hub clamp 54 Fig. 3 . These cams are held in position by appropriate screws which are provided through bevelled apertures in the eccentric cams 80, 82 and 84. As the screws are inserted into the bevelled apertures, the cams 80, 82, 84 are urged outwardly into engagement with the periphery 86 of the central aperture 88.of the disc 20. This insures a positive engagement between the disc 20 and the hub 22 so that the disc 20 is accurately fixed with respect to the hub 22. This arrangement prevents the disc from having any radial movement with respect to the center established by the fingers 56, 58, 60, 62, 64.A clamp disc 89 sits on top of the cams 80, 82, 84 and the disc 20 and is secured to the hub clamp 54 by three screws not shown that are torqued suitably to contain any vertical motion of the disc 20 in the cartridge assembly. Further it is to be understood that in a preferred embodiment housing 12 is comprised of a durable plastic material so that at least side 16 about hub 22 is flexible. This flexibility assists in the proper seating of the fingers 56, 58, 60, 62, 64 about the spindle. Industrial Applicability The operation of the disc cartridge arrangement 10 is as follows. The cartridge 10 is inserted in a disc drive not shown and as the hub clamp 54 comes into alignment with the spindle, member 59 of the disc drive extends into the slot 45 to open door 26. With door 26 open the apertures 34, 36 and 38 are aligned with apertures 48, 50 and 52 so that the heads not shown of the disc drive not shown can be deployed through the upper and lower sides 14 and 16 of the housing 12 into a position immediately adjacent to the upper and lower sides of the disc 20. The hub clamp 54 is at the same time urged down onto the spindle with the fingers 56, 58, 60, 62 and 64 thereof firmly engaging the spindle circumferentially.The region of the housing immediately around the hub 22 flexes as the cartridge 10 is urged down on the spindle and then urged slightly away from the spindle by the disc drive so that the fingers are properly seated about the spindle. It is to be noted that the lever and cam arrangement 42 is designed in such a way that the member 59 of the disc drive not shown when inserted into the slot 45 essentially pushes the lever and cam arrangement 42 out of the way as it proceeds therepast, so as to first unlock door 26 and then urge it precisely to the open position. From the above, it can be seen that the cartridge arrangement 10 allows for contaminant free operation and that the door means 24 and the hub clamp 54 allow for proper alignment. Other aspects, objects, advantages of the invention can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure and the appended claims.
