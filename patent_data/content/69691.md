# Apparatus for attaching fasteners to belts.

## Abstract
A riveting gun 55 is mounted on a carriage 37 for movement on a way 36 to a plurality of positions over belt fasteners 11 placed along the edge of a clamped belt 12 . The gun 55 is guided into the desired positions by an indexing member 50 which permits actuation of the gun 55 for driving the rivets 67 through the fasteners 11 and belt 12 when in position. A rivet deforming member 18 on the other side of the belt 12 upsets the rivets 67 . Resilient mounting of the carriage 37 is provided to maintain alignment and absorb impact reaction stresses.
