# Apparatus for recording and reading information on a magnetic disk.

## Abstract
The apparatus records and reads binary information on a magnetic disk having magnetisable surfaces subdivided into a plurality of concentric tracks in which the information is recorded in block form sectors . A first electric motor rotates the magnetic disk at a substantially constant angular velocity, and a second motor 22 of stepping type is oper able to position the magnetic recording and reading heads 16, 17 with respect to the recording tracks of the disk. On each track, each block of binary information contains prere corded burst information which, when read by the corre sponding magnetic head, is capable of causing micrometric rotary adjusting movements of the stepping motor to bring the magnetic head into precise alignment with the selected recording track and to hold it in that position. Thus am plitude information from two bursts either side of the centre line of the track is compared 52, 55, 59, 58 to provide a signal µSTEP when the amplitude discrepancy exceeds a threshold, and a signal µDIR indicating the sense of the discrepancy. A motor control circuit 61 effects micro steps by applying pulses to the stepping motor 22 with duty cycle modulation.
