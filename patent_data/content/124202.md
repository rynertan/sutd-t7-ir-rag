## Abstract
A timing control system and timer sub assembly for microwave cooking source parallel connected with a timer and series connected with an interval time switch and a de frost cycle switch and a power level selector. The timer is operable to cycle the defrost switch at a fast rate for se lected operating timer intervals of a given value or greater and a slow rate for selected interval less than the given va lue. The timer provides progressively decreasing on time of the defrost cycle switch for each cycle. The timer sub as sembly has a pawl driven ratchet wheel having a toothed sector of lesser pitch diameter and a meshing rachet wheel having periodic deep notches spaced thereabout for per mitting the drive pawl to periodically engage the teeth of lesser pitch diameter for slower advance of the driven ratchet for indexing a plurality of rotary cam tracks for mi crowave source switch actuation.
