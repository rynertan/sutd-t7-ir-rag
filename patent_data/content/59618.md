# Process for the preparation of mixed resin foams.

## Abstract
Conventional foamed products prepared from a phenol formaldehyde resin, blowing agent and acidic catalyst are disadvantageous as they posses a fairly brittle foam structure with low compression strength and high friability. Such problems are now overcome by preparing a foam by reacting a furfuryl alcohol polymer and a phenol formaldehyde resin in the presence of a blowing agent and a catalytic amount of a strong acid catalyst. The foam can be used for insulation purposes.
