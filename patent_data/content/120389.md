# Method of driving a semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser oscillating in a single mode under direct current drive is driven by a signal in which a high fre quency current is superposed on a direct current, so that the laser is brought into continuous wave pulsed oscillation at a pulse width of at most 1.2 ns, whereby laser noise is suppres sed.
