## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and, in particular, to anti bacterial pharmaceutical compositions which may be administered by injection. British Patent Specification No. 1,508,977 describes inter alia clavulanic acid of formula I EMI1.1 and salts thereof, and the use of such compounds as synergists for penicillins and cephalosporins. Synergistic formulations for injection comprising clavulanic acid or salts thereof are described in the aforementioned British Patent an3. in European PatentApplication Publication No. 0008905. Certain of these compositions tend to lose potency fairly quickly on reconstitution in the solvent for injection. It is an object of this invention to provide an injectable pharmaceutical composition having improved stability relative to the previously known compositions. Accordingly the present invention provides an injectable pharmaceutical composition, which composition comprises a a water soluble salt of clavulanic acid b a water soluble salt of an a amino penicillin or cephalosporin and c a vehicle of water and glycofurol. In one aspect, the present invention provides an injectable pharmaceutical composition, which composition comprises a solution of a a water soluble salt of clavulanic acid b a water soluble salt of an a amino penicillin or cephalosporin and c a vehicle of water and glycofurol and d optionally a local anaesthetic such as lignocaine or benzyl alcohol. Glycofurol is the recognised term in the art for tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether with an average of two ethylene glycol groups. Glycofurol may be regarded as having the formula IT EMI2.1 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2.Suitably the glycofurol is Glycofurol 75 supplied byRoche. The ratio of glycofurol to water in the compositions of this invention is normally in the range 70 30 to 10 90, usually in the range 60 40 to 20 80, preferably in the range 50 50 to 20 80 for example approximately 50 50 or approximately 25 75 these ratios are volume volume .Of these 25 75 is preferred. The ratio of anti bacterial agents to vehicle present in the composition is normally from 2 15 to 7 15 usually 2 15 to 4 15, and generally approximates to 3 15. These ratios are weight taken as free acid equivalentweight volume . The ratio of clavulanate salt to penicillin or cephalosporin salt present in the composition will normally be in the range 10 1 to 1 10, usually in the range 1 1 to 1 8, and will preferably be 1 2 to 1 5, for example 1 2. These ratios are weight weight ratios based on free acid equivalent weights . Suitably the clavulanate salt will be the sodium or potassium salt, preferably the potassium salt. Suitably the penicillin or cephalosporin salt is the sodium or potassium salt, preferably the sodium salt. a Amino penicillins and cephalosporins have a sidechain of structure III EMI3.1 wherein R is an organic radical of up to 20 carbon atoms.In formula III , the NH group is attached to the 6 or 7 position of the penicillin or cephalosporin nucleus. A particularly useful class of such penicillins and cephalosporins has R in structure III being phenyl, p hydroxyphenyl or cyclohexadienyl. Examples of such penicillins include ampicillin and amoxycillin, and of such cephalosporins include cephradine. It has been found that this invention is particularly pertinent to formulations wherein the penicillin is amoxycillin. The formulations of this invention are particularly applicable for penicillins and cephalosporins that show a tendency to dimerise in aqueous solution at pH values greater than 7.0. Such penicillins and cephalosporins include cephalexin, cephaloglycine and epicillin. Thus one preferred embodiment of this invention is an injectable pharmaceutical composition comprising a solution of sodium or potassium clavulanate and sodium or potassium amoxycillin in a vehicle of water and glycofurol. In these preferred embodiments the relative proportions of the ingredients are suitably as hereinbefore. Most preferably in these embodiments the active ingredients are potassium clavulanate and sodium amoxycillin. In another aspect, the invention also provides a twin pack in which the first part of the pack contains the active ingredients and the second part of the pack contains the vehicle. The invention also provides a process for preparing the composition of the invention, which process comprises bringing into association the active ingredients and the vehicle. The exact nature of this process, of course, varies with the nature of the compositions to be prepared. When the composition is in solution form, then the process comprises dissolving the active ingredients either simultaneously or consecutively in the vehicle. When the composition is in the twin pack form, then the process comprises filling the appropriate ingredients into separate parts of the pack. The twin pack of this invention will generally comprise a vial containing the mixed active ingredients in the form of a dry powder and or a freeze dried plug and a second vial or rmrpoule containing iherMed solvents. In order to form the injectable solution the liquid from the second vial will be transferred to the first vial. The vial containing the active ingredients is conveniently filled by freeze drying a solution of the clavulanate salt in situ and thereafter adding to the resulting plug the penicillin or cephalosporin salt in powder form. These dry components may then be sealed into a vial. Alternatively the vial may be filled in a convenient conventional manner with separately prepared dry salts in powder form. The injectable compositions of this invention may be used in the manner described in U.K. Patent No. 1,508,977. In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a method of improving the stability of an aqueous injectable solution of a water soluble salt of clavulanic acid and a water soluble salt ofan a amino penicillin or cephalosporin which method comprises incorporating in the solution glycofurol as hereinbefore described.
