# Optical fiber temperature sensor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a novel fiber optic temperature sensor based on internally or self generated thermal radiation. The wavelengths of the spectral composition of the self generated thermal radiation vary along the length of an optical fiber as a function of the variations in the temperature of an object along the length of the optical fiber. However, since the total radiation varies exponentially with temperature, the spectral composition and total power of the radiation transmitted to an end of the optical fiber is determined substantially by the highest temperature region along the optical fiber whereby the temperature, location and length of a hot spot, or region, of the object is determined.
