# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REDUCING THE STORAGE TIME IN A SATURATED TRANSISTOR

## Abstract
The storage time of a saturated transistor is reduced by connecting a low impedance current source or sink to the base of the transistor in response to a control pulse which turns the transistor off, to thereby increase the rate at which the excess minority carriers are removed from the base. The connection of the current source or sink to the base is provided by means of an inductor connected to the base ter minal of the transistor and an auxiliary transistor that is ac tuated in response to the voltage across the inductor. A change of the current through the inductor produces a vol tage transient across the inductor, which is applied to the base of the auxiliary transistor to turn it on. In turn, the auxili ary transistor connects the base of the main switching tran sistor to a current source or sink, depending on the type of transistor, to thereby increase the current flow into or out of the base region of the transistor, thus reducing its storage time.
