# SAMPLED COSTAS LOOP

## Abstract
A Costas loop for recovering the carrier signal from a carrier signal which is continuously phase modulated by a data signal. So as to increase the stability of the Costas loop the loop comprises a clock signal generator controlled sample and hold circuit for applying as a control signal to the voltage controlled oscillator a square wave signal which is obtained by instantaneously sampling the control signal generated in the Costas loop at a predetermined fixed instant per bit period.
