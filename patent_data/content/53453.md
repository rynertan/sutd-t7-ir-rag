# Ultrasonic bubble detector.

## Abstract
Ultrasonic bubble detection apparatus utilizes a typically one piece, rigid housing 10 having a channel 12 defined therein for receiving flow tubing 14 in which bubbles are to de detected. First and second ultra sonic sending and receiving transducers 16, 18 are positioned on opposite sides of the channel 12 , with an aperture communicating between each of the trans ducers and the channel, the apperture being filled with an elastomeric material 26, 28 capable of transmitting ultrasound energy between the channel 12 and each transducer. An air containing slot 30 is positioned at the bottom of the channel to hinder the propagation of ultrasound energy through the housing 10 from the first to the second transducer 16, 18 by a route other than one passing through the elastomeric material.
