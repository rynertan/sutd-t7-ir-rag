# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an impact resistant polymer composition based on a copolymer of unsaturated nitrile, a largely saturated rubber and a chlorinated polyethylene. To improve certain properties of said composition, it is characterized in that said composition comprises a. 50 95 parts by weight of one or more polymers obtained by the polymerizaton of 10 90 by weight of styrene and or derivatives of styrene and 90 10 by weight of acrylonitrile and or methacrylonitrile. b. 5 50 parts by weight of b.1. a largely saturated rubber b.2. chlorinated polyethylene, which chlorinated polyethylene has a chlorine content of between 32 and 40 by weight and a DSC crystallinity of 0 7 , while the weight ratio of rubber to chlorinated polyethylene is between 2 1 and 1 10.
