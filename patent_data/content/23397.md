# Heteropolysaccharide process and microorganism for producing it.

## Abstract
Biopolymer PS 87, a heteropolysaccharide comprising glucose, galactose, mannose, glucuronic acid and fucose, is pseudoplastic and has a consistency at 20 C of at least 150 poise and a yield stress value at 20 C of at least 30 dynes cmÂ². Biopolymer PS 87 is synthesized by a specific strain or mutant of Bacillus polymyxa NCIB 11429 or by micro organisms which have undergone genetic manipula tions. This heteropolysaccharide has many domestic and industrial applications as a suspending agent or thickener.
