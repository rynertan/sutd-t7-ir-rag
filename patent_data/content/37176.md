# Movably jointed high pressure conduit.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to fluid delivery conduits having relative movement between the ends, and capable of delivering fluid at pressures exceeding 15,000 pounds per square inch 10, 106 MPa for use in hydraulic machinery. The prior art has generally employed hoses delivering fluid at lower pressures, with pressure intensifiers incorporated into the working head. The mass of the intensifier restricts freedom of movement of the head. The present invention provides for transmission of the full working fluid pressure up to the order of 60,000 psi 40,423 MPa to the working head, so that the operator can freely position the relatively small mass of the head and tool. The conduit comprises a plurality of rigid lines having rotary joints therebetween. The joints employ radial seals which contain the full working fluid pressure and permit relative movement between the rigid cubes when working pressure is not applied.
