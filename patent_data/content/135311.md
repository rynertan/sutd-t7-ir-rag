# High rigidity ethylene propylene copolymer and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A high rigidity, whitening resistant ethylene propylene copolymer is provided, which is obtained by copolymerizing propylene with ethylene at three successive stages wherein at the respective first, second and third stages, a copolymer fraction having a specified ethylene content is formed in a specified amount based on the total polymerization amount, in the presence of a catalyst obtained by reacting an organoaluminum compound L or a reaction product there of with an electron donor E with TiCℓ₄ reacting the resulting solid product I with an E and an electron acceptor and combining the resulting solid product II with an L and an aromatic carboxylic acid ester R , the molar ratio of R to II being specified, and in the presence of hydrogen.
