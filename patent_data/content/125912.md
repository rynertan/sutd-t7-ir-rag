# Method of producing ceramic parts.

## Abstract
Ceramic parts of complicated configurations with differ ent thicknesses portions can be mass produced economically with high production yield and excellent quality by mixing a ceramic powder or metal powder with a molding additive, injection molding the mixture to form a green body of a desired shape, processing the green body to a substantially final configuration, removing the molding additive from the processed body to yield a processed and degreased body, and firing the processed and degreased body to sinter the same.
