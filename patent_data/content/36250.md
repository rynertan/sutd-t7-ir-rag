# Wrap around device and arrangement which includes such a device.

## Abstract
A wrap around device for enclosing an elongate object comprises a cover 1 which is preferably dimensionally recoverable and has two opposed edge portions 3,4 that can be interlocked to retain them together. At least one of the edge portions, and preferably both the edge portions, are provided with a protuberance 7,9 , which extend along the edge por tions and engage the opposed edge portion to retain them together against a tensile force for example as may be caused if the device and enclosed object is bent. Preferably at least one of the edge portions is provided with a layer of adhesive to prevent moisture ingress between the edge portions. The invention also provides an arrangement comprising a wrap around device and a slide that may be moved along the edge portions to engage them.
