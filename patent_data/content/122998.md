# Method and apparatus for electron curing on a cooled drum.

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with a method of transfer coating electron beam curable materials, by applying such materials to the surface of a cooled drum, either through a sheet or web carrying the same over the drum or from the drum surface itself, curing the material against the drum at a region of electron beam radiation direction thereupon and releasing the cured material from the drum surface and with the latter, where desired, reflecting radiation back into the material being cured.
