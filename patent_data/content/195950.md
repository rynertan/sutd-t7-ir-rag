# Device which synchronizes free running oscillator frequency by means of a feedback saturable transformer and square wave output voltage.

## Abstract
A new device meant to synchronize free running oscillator frequency with a feedback saturable transformer and square wave output voltage. It may find application in space or ground uses. Its uniqueness is given by the insertion within the feedback circuit made up of a saturable transformer of a synchronizing circuit which causes feedback transformer saturation at times strictly dependent upon synchronism generator, without impeding frequency adjustment by means of a potentiometer.
