## Description
SEALING OF CONTAINERS In order to preserve various products such as food stuffs, cr beverages it is conventional practice to fill the product into a container body and then to seal the body b a closure, trapping a sealing gasket in the seal between the body l√¨d the closure. This sealing gasket is conventionally made by lining the sealing face of the closure with a liquid composition comprising rubbery polymer, and then drying the liquid composition to form a gasket. The sealing face of the closure is compressed around the end of the container thereby sealing the closure to the sealing face with the gasket within the seal. When the container is a bottle this gasket is trapped between the sealing face of the rim of the bottle and the overlying closure.When, as is more usual., the container is a can the gasket is generally trapped in the double seam. formed in conventional manner by compressing the outer periphery of the container closure around an outwardly extending flange of the side wall of the can body and then pressing the flange and the closure periphery against the side wall of the can body, generally in a singie operation. The majority of the compositions that are filled into such containers are substantially free of fats and oils. For instance the filling composition may be of fruit or vegetables in an aqueous medium or may be an aqueous beverage. In these circumstances the filling composition will have substantially no effect on the gasket, even upon prolonged storage, and so the sealing composition from which the gasket is made can be formulated having regard primarily to the need to achieve a good initial seal. Commercially satisfactory sealing compositions are almost always formed of rubbery polymer together with various additives, typically filler and tackifying resin.It is generally accepted that, for good sealing properties, the polymer should dry to form d rubbery and elastic film. A wide variety of polymers have been proposed in the literature for use in sealing compositions for containers filled with aqueous products such as fruit, vegetables and beverages and many such polymers are described in ourBritish Patent Specifications 2084600 and 2084601. Despite the large number of polymers that have been proposed in the literature the commercial reality is that styrene butadiene rubbers are invariably used for aqueous filling compositions such as fruit, vegetables and beverages. A particular problem arises when the filling composition contains a fat or oil, for instance when at least 0.5 by weight of the filling composition is organic fatty or oily material. This liquid organic material may be animal or vegetable oil and the filling compositions may therefore be, for instance, fatty meats, chicken soup or products containing vegetable oils. Compcsitions based on styrene butadiene rubber are used with oily and fatty packs but it is difficult to obtain both optimum sealing properties and optimum oil resistance. For instance any modification in the formulation to improve the oil resistance is usually accompanied by a deterioration in the sealing performance. Compositions that are to be used with oily or fatty packs are often judged, for instance byGovernmental and other agencies, by an open oil immersion test. A suitable test is the test of the ParmaInstitute in Italy. In this test, referred to herein as the Parma Open Oil Immersion Test, a stripe of the composition being tested is spread onto a strip of tin plate and then dried for 10 minutes in a hot air oven at 800C.After two days storage at ambient temperature the tin plate strip is immersed in olive oil at 903C for 2 hours. The strip is tben removed from the oil and the stripe assessed for loss of adhesion, loss of coheson ard softening each on a scale of 0 to 4, 0 sicJnifiing no deterioration in properties and 4 indicating total loss of properties. values of 1 may be adequate but O is preferred. It has been difficult te provide composition that will both pass this open oil immersion test and that will give satisfactory sealing properties. According te a first aspect of the invention we have now surprisingly found that it is possible to formulate a gasket that gives good sealing properties and that has good oil resistance if the polymeric component in the gasket comprises a copolymer of styrene and an acrylic ester. In particular a liquid composition suitable for forming a sealing gasket for a container comprises the defined copolymer and this copolymer and the other components of the composition are such that, when tested by the described oil immersion test, the loss of adhesion, loss of cohesion and degree of softening are each 0 or 1, and preferably are all O. Styrene acrylic copolymers have been mentioned previously for possible use in certain container gaskets in British Patent Specifications Nos. 2084600 and 208460 but only as one of a very large list of exemplified polymers that can be incorporated in sealing compositions. The compositions described in those specifications are described as having been tested for sealing with hot liquid nutriments, which will inevitably have been conventional oil free aqueous nutrients. The preferred polymers are said to be styrene butadiene copolymers and, as mentioned above, these are very satisfactory for substantially oil free aqueous compositions but are less satisfactory for compositions containing oil.Accordingly there is nothing in either cf those patents to suggest that it would be possible, for the first time, to achieve both good oil resistance and good sealing properties by using copolymers of styrene and acrylic ester. Also, since it is accepted that it is necessary for the polymers in gasket compositions to be rubbery, styrene acrylic ester copolymers would not generally be regarded as very satisfactory since their rubbery properties are rather poor, a film of such copolymers generally being relatively hard. A sealed container according to a second aspect of the invention is filled with a filling composition containing fat or oil and comprises a container body, a closure sealed to the body and a sealing gasket in the seal between the body and the closure and formed of a gasket composition comprising a copolymer of styrene and acrylic ester. Generally at least 50 , and preferably at least 75 , by weight of the polymer in the gasket is provided by styrene acrylic ester copolymer and usually it is preferred that this copolymer provides substantially all the polymer in the gasket. The copolymers used in the invention should be based on styrene and acrylic ester monomers and, optionally, small amounts of other monomers. However it is important that the total amount of such other monomers should be relatively low, for instance below 15 and generally below 10 , since higher amounts are likely to detract from the properties of the polymer in the gasket. There is no suggestion in British PatentSpecifications Nos. 2084600 or 2084601 that there should be any additional monomeric units in the polymer but we have surprisingly found that it is particularly advantageous that the polymer should contain from 0.5 to 10 , preferably I to 5 , by weight of monomeric units that include non esterified ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, generally acrylic or methacrylic acid.The acid groups may be in the form of free acid or in the form of a salt, for instance with an alkali metal, amine or ammonia. According to a third aspect of the invention a liquid composition suitable for forming a sealing gasket for a container comprises a copolymer of styrene, acrylic ester and non esterified ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, as described above. This aspect of the invention also includes gaskets made from this composition, for instance by lining onto a can end or the other closure in conventional manner. The acrylic ester is generally an ester cf acrylic acid or less preferably methacrylic acid with an alkyl group generally containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, most preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Mixtures of acrylic esters may be present in the polymer. Preferably the acrylic ester consists wholly or mainly of butyl acrylate. Preferred copolymers are formed from 30 to 70 styrene, 1 to 10 methacrylic or, preferably, acrylic acid and 70 to 30 alkyl methacrylate or, preferably, alkyl acrylate. Preferably the amount of styrene is 40 to 60 , the amount of acrylate ester 60 to 40 and the amount of acrylic acid 1 te 5 , all percentages being by weight. The money viscosity is generally 20 to 200, preferably 35 to 100. The polymer is preferably supplied as a latex. The gasket is generally made by depositing onto the sealing surface of the can end of other closure a liquid sealing composition and then drying this to form the gasket. The gasket composition, and thus the solids content of the liquid sealing composition, generally contains other components such that the amount of polymer in the compositions is generally from 20 to 60 , most preferably 30 to 50 , by weight of the solids content of the compositions. The compositions typically contain from 20 to 60 , most preferably 30 to 50 , by weight of a filler.Typical fillers are talc and kaolin but any of the fillers known for use in container sealing compositions, for instance as discussed in British Patent Specification 2084600, may be used. The compositions may include a tackifier resin, for instance in amounts up to 30 by weight, most preferably 5 to 15 by weight, based on the weight of the solids content of the composition. Suitable materials are well known and may be selected from, for instance, synthetic hydrocarbon or petroleum resins, polyterpene resins, phenolic resins modified with natural resins such as rosin or terpene, xylene formaldehyde resins ad modified products thereof and esterified rosins or other rosin type resins such as rosin, hydrogenated rosin or hardened rosin. The compositions will generally contain at least one stabiliser for stabilising the liquid sealing composition. The amount of stabiliser is generally from 1 to 10 , preferably 2 to 7 , by weight solids. Any of the stabilisers conventionally used may be used, including styrene maleic anhydride or other styrene copolymers, methyl cellulose, polyacrylamide, ethoxylate condensates, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ammonium oleate and casein. Mixtures may be used. The compositions may contain minor amounts, for instance up to 10 by weight solids maximum and generally below 5 and often below 1 by weight solids, of other additives that are conventional in liquid sealing compositions based on a latex of rubbery copolymer. Such additives include viscosity increasing agents for instance ammonium alginate, bentonite or gum keraya or high molecular weight polyacrylic acid , bactericides, corrosion inhibitors, surfactants, antioxidants for instance phenolic or amino antioxidants and pH adjusters for instance ammonia, primary amine, sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate . Volatile additives such as ammonia will be present in the liquid sealing composition but may evaporate during the formation of the gasket by drying. The total solids content of the liquid sealing composition is generally from 20 to 85 , preferably 30 to 80 , by weight with the balance generally being water. The liquid sealing composition may be made simply by blending together the latex of polymer and the other additives under conditions that avoid coagulation of the latex and the formation of a uniform dispersion of the latex, any filler, ana other solids ingredient. The liquid composition may be lined onto the can end or other container closure and dried all in conventional manner. The can, jar or other container body may be filled with the oily filling composition and the closure then applied to the body and affixed to it in conventional manner as discussed above. Preferably the container is a can. The container is generally completely filled with the filling composition but may be only partly filled.The filling composition generally contains at least 1 , and preferably 2 or more, of an animal or vegetable fat cr oil. To demonstrate the surprising properties of the invention, 6 liquid sealing compositions were prepared from the components identified in Table 1. All amounts are b weight. The amounts of latex are the dry weight of latex. Latex X is a latex of hot polymerised styrene butadiene rubber having a bound styrene content between 44 and 48e and a Mooney viscosity between 35 and 5. Latex Y is a latex of a compcund of 2.5E methacrylic acid, 51t styrene, 26.5 butadiene and 20 butyl acrylate and that has a Mooney viscosity of 39. Latex Z is a latex of a copolymer of, by weight, 3t acrylic acid, 475 styrene and 50 butyl acrylate and that has a Mooney viscosity of 58. The stabiliser in compositions A, B and C was a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer whilst in compositionsD, E, F and G it was casein. The vulcanising system in compositions D, E and F was 0.8t zinc dibutyl dithiocarbamate and 0.2 sulphur. The other solid ingredients are formed of conventional additives such as thickener, antioxidant, antifungicide, carbon black and surfactant.

Cans having a soldered side seam were then filled with a hot liquid nutrient, typically at a temperature of 970C, leaving a small headspace. In some of the tests the liquid nutrient was free of fat or oil but in others 2 vegetable oil was added to the nutrient immediately before filling so as to give a layer of oil on the surface at the time of closing, thus simulating a typical oily pack. These test closures were then double seamed onto the filled cans, sometimes with steam injection into the headspace whilst fitting the closures, and sometimes without steam injection. The closed cans were then sterilised, typically at 3200C for 20 minutes, and after sterilisation were immediately cooled in water contains gas producing, non pathogeiiic micro orcanisms capable of growth in the aforementioned nutrient. After cooling and whilst still wet with the cocling water, the cans were subjected to a controlled deformation at the junction of the side seam and the double seam of the test closure.After incubation for six days at an elevated temperature optimum for the growth of the micro organism, followed by one day at ambient temperature, the cans were examined visually and the number of swollen cans recorded. The retained vacuum in the remaining cans was measured. Cans having a low retained vacuum and the swollen cans are considered to have reached this condition through failure of the seal in the test closure. The swollen and low vacuum cans are termed failures and the biological seal value is the failure rate expressed as the number of such cans per thousand tested. Because of the procedures used the number of failed cans per thousand in this biological seal test is of course very much greater than that which would occur with commercially packed cans sealed with these compositions. The results of one series of tests are given inTable 2, standard pack results being for the aqueous nutrient and oily pack being for the aqueous nutrient with added oil. The results of another series of tests, conducted at a different time and using separately prepared compositions as shown in Table 1, are given inTable 3.

It is also apparent that the vulcanising system in composition F is not essential to obtaining good results. The compositions were tested for oil resistance by the described method and the results are shown in Table 4.
