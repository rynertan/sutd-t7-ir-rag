# Method and apparatus for measuring pH.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for measuring a chemical characteristic of a liquid 52 such as its hydrogen ion activity or pH value. A disposable cassette 10 having a reference electrode 30 and indicating electrode 24 therein utilizes the same solution 38 to first calibrate the device and then as an electrolytic bridge from the liquid sample to the reference electrode. The solution 38 has the properties of a buffered pH and also provides a stable electrochemical environment around the reference electrode 30 . In one embodiment, a volume of a liquid sample is placed into a capillary tube 50 and the open end of the tube is then placed overthe indicating electrode 24 immersed in the solution 38 . The electrical potential between the indicating electrode 24 and the spaced reference electrode 30 in the electrolyte solution 38 pro vides a measurement of the pH value of the liquid 50 when compared to the calibration potential previously measured without the liquid sample contacting the indicating electrode 24 .
