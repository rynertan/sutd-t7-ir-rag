# Method of treating nickel base alloys.

## Abstract
A method of heat treating and coating a nickel base alloy containing chromium, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, molyb denum, tungsten, boron and carbon. The alloy is heated at a temperature of at least 1121 C to put most of the coarse gamma prime particles into solution coated with a cobalt, nickel or iron base alloy treated at a temperature of at least 871 C to lessen the sharp differential in chemistry between it and the coating at the interface thereof treated within the temperature range of from 816 to 982 C to precipitate fine gamma prime particles, to coarsen existing gamma prime particles and to precipitate discrete carbide particles and treated at a temperature within the range of from 704 to 816 C to precipitate additional fine gamma prime particles, and dis crete carbide particles at grain boundaries.
