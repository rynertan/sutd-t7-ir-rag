# Storage stable topical pharmaceutical compositions containing zinc erythromycin and t butanol.

## Abstract
A storage stable topical pharmaceutical composition containing zinc erythromycin, particularly useful in the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, is disclosed. This composition con tains a solvent having a dielectric constant, measured at 25 C, of from about 5.5 to about 15, preferably from about 8 to about 12, such as t butanol, to impart storage stability to the zinc erythromycin component. The composition may additonally contain particularly selected pharmaceutically acceptable ni trogencontaining stabilizer components, such as diisopropa nolamine.
