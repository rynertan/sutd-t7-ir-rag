# Improved impatt diode tuning circuit.

## Abstract
A typical tuning circuit 40 which couples a negative resistance microwave diode 3t to the cavity 14 of a microwave power combiner 13 consists of a metallic rod 46 which is biased by a spring 62 against the diode 36 supported by a carrier 64 which is effective to vary the position of the diode 36 along the longitudinal axis 41 of the rod 46 . The rod 46 cooperates with bores 56, 58, 59 in a block 10 to comprise, seriatim, between the diode 36 and the cavity 14 , a transmission line 46, 59 whose length varies in accordance with diode 36 position, a fixed impedance transformer 46, 58 and a fixed length transmis sion line 46, 56 .
