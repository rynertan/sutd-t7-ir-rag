# High rate sputtering of exhaust oxygen sensor electrode.

## Abstract
An improved method of sputtering a platinum exhaust gas electrode onto a vitrified zirconia thimble for an elec trochemical type exhaust gas oxygen sensor, whereby porous high surface area films are consistently deposited at high rates of deposition. A DC magnetron cathode assembly having a magnetic field strength of at least 500 gauss across its target face is used at a sputtering power of 4 9 kilowatts. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a thimble target spacing of less than 3.0 cm, a pressure less than 1.33 Pascals 10 millitorr , a sputtering atmosphere consisting essentially of more than 50 percent nitrogen and or oxygen, an electric ally isolated deposition surface, and an electrically floating reference electrode precoated on the zirconia thimble sur face, are used.
