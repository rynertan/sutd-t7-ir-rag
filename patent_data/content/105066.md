# Process for the separation of fatty acids using a solid bed of adsorbent.

## Abstract
Stearic acid and oleic acid are separated from mixtures of stearic acid with palmitic acid and oleic acid with linoleic acid by contacting the mixture at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent comprising a nonionic hydrophobic insoluble crosslinked styrene polymer, thereby selectively adsorbing the stearic or oleic acid. The adsorbed acid may be de sorbed using a desorbent. Preferably the process is carried out using a simulated moving bed countercurrent adsorp tion system.
