# HYDRAULIC HORIZONTAL MIXER

## Abstract
A hydraulically powered mixing aerator rides on an upright beam member for submersion in a body of water such as an equalization basin, oxidation ditch or sludge holding tank used in sewage treatment plants. The aerator employs a submersible, hydraulically powered mixing motor driving a propeller which is mounted on the beam member by a slidable bracket for height ajdustment. The beam member is swingably supported to allow adjustment of the vertical plane angle. Because the beam member is also mounted for rotation, substantially any attitude or position of the mixer can be selected for creating an efficient flow pattern within the body of water. The speed at which the propeller is rotated, and therefore, the rate at which the water is circulated and aerated, is selectively adjustable. The hydraulically driven motor provides for a low speed and high torque rotation of the propeller without the use of a reduction gear.
