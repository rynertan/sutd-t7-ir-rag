# MIXER FOR MIXING FIBRES INTO A SLURRY

## Abstract
A mixer for mixing glass fibres into a thick aqueous cement slurry comprises means 12,14 for feeding glass fibres on to the surface of a batch of the slurry in an upright cylindrical chamber 10 , an agitator mounted on a coaxial vertical shaft 16 and carrying at its lower end both a plurality of short impeller blades 17 and a long horizontal member 18 with tip blades 19 of opposite sense to the impeller blades, so as to cause vertical as well as horizontal circulation of the slurry, and stationary baffles 20 on the wall of the chamber angled to cause production of standing waves on the surface of the slurry.
