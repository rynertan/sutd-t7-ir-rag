# Vehicle bumpers.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a vehicle bumper comprising a rigid tube 11 to which mounting arms 30 are attached by brackets 34 to support the tube on a vehicle body and a bumper shaped moulding 10 attached at its centre to the tube by a U shaped bracket 15 and also to the brackets 34 . Neither the brackets 34 nor the bracket 15 penetrate the wall of the tube 11 where they are attached to the tube to avoid any loss in structural strength of the tube at the attachment points.

## Description
VEHICLE BUMPERS This invention relates to vehicle bumpers. The invention provides a vehicle bumper comprising a rigid elongate tube, attachment means for mounting the tube on a vehicle body, a plastics bumper shaped moulding extending along the tube and mounting means attaching the moulding to the tube to transmit an impact on the moulding to the tube, both the attachment means and mounting means engaging the tube without penetrating the tube wall. The tube is therefore not weakened by the mounting of the tube on the vehicle and the bumper moulding on the tube. Preferably the mounting means for mounting the bumper on the tube may comprise a bracket attached at the centre of the bumper moulding and having an aperture through which the tube extends to enable the bracket to be slid along the tube into the required position, the bracket also being formed with an abutment adjacent the aperture and facing away from the bumper moulding to transmit impact on the bumper moulding to the tube. The bracket may comprise a U shaped bracket having a base connected to the bumper moulding at the centre thereof and a pair of resilient arms having apertures therein through which the tube extends, the resilient arms, in their relaxed condition, being angled with respect to one another to grip the tube, the bracket being assembled on the tube by holding the arms in parallel relationship to allow the bracket to slide over the tube. The beam can thereby be joined to the bumper in a simple and rapid hand operation. The following is a description of a specific embodiment of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a motor vehicle bumper assembly including a bumper shaped plastics moulding and reinforcing tube Figure 2 is a perspective view of part of the reinforcing tube and a bracket for connecting the tube to the centre of the bumper mouldings Figure 3 is a perspective view of the tube and attachment arms for connecting the tube to the vehicle structure Figure 4 is a detailed perspective view of the attachment of an arm to the tube and the bumper moulding to the attachment between the arm and the tube and Figure 5 is a perspective view of a central part of the bumper assembly and Figures 6 to 8 are further detailed views of the assembly. Referring to the drawings, there is shown a vehicle bumper assembly comprising a moulded plastics e.g. PP EPDM i.e. Polypropylene ethylenepropylene terpolymer channel section wrap round bumper moulding 10 having upper and lower walls 10a and lOb mounted on and supported by a reinforcing beam 11. The beam 11 is a rigid glass fibre reinforced plastics pultrusion which may be a closed section, for example, a square section tube, The tube wall is free of any opening or aperture through the wall which would weaken the tube. The bumper moulding 10 comprises a main part 12 which is slightly bowed in plan view to extend across the front of the vehicle and wrap round ends 13 to protect the forward corners of the vehicle. On the inside of the channel of the main part 12 of the moulding there is a raised rib or ribs 14 extending in the plane of the beam and against which the tube 11 engages. As a result of the bowing of the main part of the moulding 12 and practical limitation on the depth of the ribs relative to the wall thickness which is feasible , the ends of the tube 11 bear against the inside of the moulding whereas the central part of the tube is spaced from the central part of the moulding. At the centre of the tube 11 there is aU shaped moulded resilient plastics e.g. polypropylene bracket 15 comprising a base 15a and legs 15b. The legs 15b have square apertures 15c which are slightly oversize from the tube 11 and, in its natural state, the legs 15b diverge slightly away from the base.This also enables the aperture to be produced in the legs in a simple moulding tool for the bracket since the apertures can be formed without the need for elements in the mould having to move in a direction transverse to the direction of opening and closing of the mould.The bracket is mounted on the tube by holding the legs parallel and threading the tube through the openings 15c in the legs as illustrated in Figure 2 to locate the bracket at the centre of the tube. When released, the legs move apart slightly to grip the tube in the holes 15c. The bracket 15 is located on the tube with the base 15a on the forward side of the tube to bear on the inner side of the bumper moulding 12 at the centre thereof and the flange 14 is cut away as indicated at 16 at the centre to provide clearance for the bracket. Referring now to Figures 6 to 9, the base 15a of the bracket is formed with a pair of upstanding inclined tabs 17 which terminate in heads 17a and the legs 15b of the bracket are extendd above the top edge of the base to form shoulders 18 spaced outwardly of and facing in the opposite direction to the tabs 17.The bumper moulding 12 is formed with a rectangular recess 19 along the central part of the forward side of the moulding to receive a number plate 20 for the vehicle and the base of the recess is formed with slots 21 through which the tabs 17 extend to lock into recesses 22 in the bumper moulding. The edges of the moulding above the slots are thus trapped between the tabs 17 and shoulders 18 on the bracket 15. The lower part of the base 15a of the bracket has a downwardly and rearwardly inclined wall 15d which follows the inside of the lower channel wall lOb of the bumper moulding. The lower end of the base wall 15d is formed with a tab 23 which engages over an edge portion of the channel wall lOb and the tab is formed with a head 23a at its free end to snap into a recess 24 in the outer face of the channel wall lOb. The legs 15b of the bracket are formed with buttresses 15c between the base 15a and openings 15c to bear on the beam 11 and transmit impact from the bumper moulding to the rigid tube. The base 15 is connected to the inside of the bumper moulding 10 as illustrated in Figure 9. The tabs 17 are located in the slots 21 and the base is then raised to snap the heads 17a on the tabs into the recesses 22 and, at the same time, to snap the head of lower tab 23 into recess 24 in the channel bottom wall 10b. The base 15a is then fastened to the moulding 10 and a number plate 20 is fastened to the front face of the moulding in the recess 19 of the moulding by a flat headed staple 27 which is passed through apertures in the number plate, bumper moulding and base. The staple has legs 28 the free ends of which project through the base 15a and are turned outwardly as can be seen in Figure 8 to lock the assembly together. Referring again to Figures 1, 3 and 4, the tube 11 is mounted on the vehicle structure by means of a pair of arms 30 attached to the tube intermediate the centre and outer ends of the tube and extending rearwardly of the above for attachment to parts of the vehicle structure not shown. The forward end of each has upper and lower lugs 31, 32 and each arm is attached to the tube 11 by means of a stirrup shaped bracket 33 which extends around the tube and has corresponding upper and lower lugs 34, 35 attached to the lugs 31, 32 of the arm by bolts 36. The lower lugs 32, 35 of the arm and bracket are extended downwardly to bear on the inside bottom wall lOb of the bumper moulding and the moulding is attached to the lugs by a fastening device 37. The rigid tube which reinforces the bumper moulding 10 is thus mounted on the vehicle body and the moulding is attached to the tube without the need for any aperture through the tube wall which would weaken the tube. The central attachment bracket 15 between the tube and the bumper moulding spans the gap between the bumper moulding and reinforcing tube at the centre thereof to transmit external impacts on the moulding of the tube. The rigid tube reinforcing the bumper moulding 10 provides a strong buffer fDr resisting impact. The bracket and arm attachments to the tube and moulding can be quickly and simply assembled. The number plate or possibly another trim or decoration element covers the lugs 17 projecting tabs extending through the slots in the bumper moulding and assists in holding the tabs engaged over the slot edges.
