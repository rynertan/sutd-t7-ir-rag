# Electrode, fixed and stabilised by vacuum.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electrode intended, for ex ample, for electrocardiogram examinations, and capable of being held in position by suction. Vacuum conditions are created through a hose or tube 8 , through which a measur ing conductor 7 is drawn. The electrode comprises an in flexible backpiece 3 , an intermediate component 2 made of an elastomeric material, and an electrode plate 1 , prefer ably made of a silver coated plastics. The intermediate com ponent 2 includes a relatively inflexible sealing ring 9 which, in the operative state of the electrode, supports against the skin of a patient via a sealing lip 13 and against the opposing side of the backpiece 3 . The electrode plate 1 is firmly connected to the backpiece, while the sealing ring carried by the intermediate component 2 is movable and can be readily sprung away from the backpiece via resilient means 17 . When no load is exerted on the lip side of the ring and the ring is thus urged outwardly, a vacuum valve is closed automatically through the intermediate component 2 , and is re opened when the electrode is pressed against the surface of the skin, whereupon the electrode is held firm ly by suction.
