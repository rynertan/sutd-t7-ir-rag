## Description
Ceramic structure thermal radiator, and process for constructing itThe invention concerns a radiator for space heating characterized by a high yield completely ceramic structure, prepared by utilizing the thermal properties of the construction Process.It is known that metal radiatiors of every type present the problem on construction of realizing the internal spaces for the circulation of hot water, which are prepared by using occlusion cores which are then removed after casting.However, this process prevents the formation of large cavities with small inner volumes, to increase the exchange surface between the hot water and the environment. In fact, the thermal yield of a radiator depends substantially on the ratio between the radiating surfaces and the volume of water at the limits of the mechanical strength of the structure, the optimization of the yield requires the presence of very large surfaces at the edges so that a small volume of hot water moving on the inside may radiate.The aim of the invention is to realize radiators with high yield, striking mechanical strength operational life, with no particular maintenance requirements.This aim is achieved with radiators prepared by casting ceramic materials of any type in plaster forms, designed so that the water in the mixture is absorbed for a limited thickness so as to leave in the liquid state the material inside the dehydrated and so solidified perimeter structure, and so that when the liquid is removed inner spaces are created in large precise shapes.It is evident that the subseauent processing of the resulting ceramic radiators that is, drying, painting and then firing in ceramic kilns affords products with strength properties analogous to those of metal radiators and with much higher yields.In fact, the advantages of ceramic radiators are very smooth inner surfaces of the spaces and outer surfaces of the radiating areas, due to the perfect fusion of the paint with the ceramic mixture, upon firing at high temperature, less loss of water moving through the inner spaces, due to the lack of roughness on the surfaces, with ess strain on the pump faster movement of air on the outer surfaces, and so increased thermal exchange absolute hygiene, due to the constituent material, ahalogous to that of bathroom fixtures high thermal yield, due to the advantageous ratio between radiating surfaces and water volume good pressure resistance.The invention is shown in an exemDlifying nonlimiting preferred embodiment in the attached figures 1 and 2, which show, respectively a horizontal section of the structure of some tubes of a radiator a portion of an external axonometric view. With reference to the details the figures show the internal spaces 1 and 2, with even complex shapes, surrounded by the structure of constant thickness ceramic material 3, easily realized even around small volumes like space 2, because it is prepared by absorption oftthe water present in the casting mixture by the plaster forms placed there, while said spaces derive simply from removal of the ceramic mixture, said barbotine, which in any case remains in the liquid or semi liquid state since the water in it has not been removed.The radiators according to the invention may be made of any of the following materials, as a variant faience of any type, pottery, sandstone, porcelain hard, semi hard or even soft , with analogous results.
