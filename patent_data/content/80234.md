# Filter circuit incorporating a differential amplifier.

## Abstract
A filter circuit which operates as a substantially opti mum integrating circuit can be realized by means of a differential amplifier A a input of which is connected to an amplifier output via a series arrangement comprising a first resistor R1 and a capacitor C1 , a input and the output each being coupled via a series arrangement of a second resistor R2 and a capacitor C2 to a terminal 5 carrying a reference voltage, the second capacitor C2 carrying the output voltage, and the time constant R1, C1 of the first capacitor C1 and the first resistor R1 being substantially equal to the time constant R2, C2 of the sec ond capacitor C2 and the second resistor R2 . The ca pacitance values and the resistance values may, for exam ple, be equal.
