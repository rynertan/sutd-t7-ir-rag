# Feed deviation preventive path controlled machining method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A feedpath deviation preventive NC path controlled machining system in which a plotting unit is used, during a preliminary operation in advance of a machining operation, to produce on a record medium 18 a continuous plot equivalent to a programmed machining feed path to be followed by relative displacement between a tool member 12 and a workpiece 11 during the machining operation. A sensing head 20 is disposed in sensing relationship with the plotted record medium 18 for relative displacement to the latter jointly with the relative displacement between tne tool member 12 and the workpiece 11 . The sensing head 20 continues to trace the continuous plot for as long as the actual machining relative displacement proceeds along the programmed machining poth to produce an OK signal. An output circuit unit is provided to respond to any disappear ence of the OK signal representing a deviation of the actual displacement from the programmed path for providing a warning signal and or a control signal which acts to deactu ate the machining feed drive system 3, 6 .
