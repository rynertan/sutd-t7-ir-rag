# Fully automatic penetration hardness tester.

## Abstract
A fully automatic penetration hardness tester 10 which includes a penetrator 28 and clamp 34 driven by respective serially connected pneumatic cylinders 18, 12 for engaging test specimens 30 . Pressure regulators 46 are coupled to the respective cylinders for first applying clamping pressure against the test specimen and then ap plying a plurality of loads in a predetermined sequence to the clamped specimen through the penetrator, with the total clamping and penetrator pressure against the test specimen remaining constant through the test cycle. A control circuit 44 monitors penetrator position and automatically initiates application of the next load in the test sequence when mo tion of the penetrator following application of the preceding load has settled such that a predetermined number of sequential position readings fall within a preselected posi tion range. Specimen hardness is determined as a linear function of penetration depth under the various loads. An automatic calibration feature determines gain and offset of such linear function from actual and apparent hardnesses of two test specimens of known differing hardness.
