# Filter apparatus and fabric filter bag.

## Abstract
A filter fabric is knitted from crimped synthetic multifilament yarn 40 having a denier in the range from 70 to 300. The yarn is knitted into courses having from about 8 to 13 stitches per centimeter. Certain yarns are knitted into stitches defining a ground G and others are knitted into terry loops T extending from the ground to a height of about 0.5 to 4 millimeters. The stitches in the ground define open areas in the range from about 1 to 100 microns. A method of making this filter fabric and apparatus utilising filter devices made from such fabric are also described.
