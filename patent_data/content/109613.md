# Automatic analytical apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic analytical apparatus comprising a sample cassette A for holding a plurality of cups 30 each containing a sample, a pipette means P for pipetting the sample contained in the cup into a reaction tube 40 transferred to a predetermined position P₃ , a transport means B for holding the reaction tube at predetermined spaces, a driving means 81 for intermittently driving the transport means, a diluent pipetting means D₁ for pipetting a diluent into the reaction tube containing the sample at a predetermined position according to a measuring item, a pipette transfer means J for measuring the sample and the diluent added thereto and for discharging them into a reaction tube 40 held in a measuring turret E , a reagent pipetting means D₂ for pipetting a reagent according to the measuring item into the sample and diluent in the reaction tube held in the measuring turret, a transfer means for transferring the reaction tube containing the sample the diluent and the reagent to an absorptiometry position, and an optical measuring means G for optically executing an absorptiometry of the sample by irradiating beam of a light source.
