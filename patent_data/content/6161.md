# Data processing system with photographic slides output.

## Abstract
Apparatus for automatically generating photographic pictures, such as 35 mm slides, includes a number of micro computer terminals at scattered locations, a central com puter at a location remote from these terminals and a pic ture producing device for creating photographic pictures from computer generated data. The microcomputer ter minals are each provided with a color display and input keyboards for enabling the user to enter data. The terminals are programmed to generate and display in color a number of standard graphical representations having certain vari able characteristics. A particular representation and its characteristics are entered by users through the terminal input as answers to questions presented by the terminal. The terminals are capable of modifying the display of a graphical representation in response to user entries which change the answers to the questions so as to create a final set of answers. When a graphical representation is com plete, to the satisfaction of the user, data representing the user s final answers are transmitted from the terminal to the central computer. The central computer is pro grammed to generate data defining the raster points for the standard graphical representations based on the data representing the user s final answers. These raster points define a graphical representation with enhanced resolution over that generated and displayed by the terminal. Finally, the picture producing device creates photographic pic tures slides from the higher resolution raster point data generated by the central computer.
