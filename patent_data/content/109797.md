# POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS RESISTANT TO ELECTRICAL AND WATER TREEING

## Abstract
A composition comprising a polymeric component and a siloxane, having at least one silicon bonded group having the general formula OX wherein X is an unsaturated hydrocarbon radical, is disclosed. A method of stabilizing polymers against water and electrical treeing, which com prises adding a siloxane having at least one silicon bonded group having the general formula OX wherein X is an unsaturated hydrocarbon, is further disclosed.
