# Connecting device.

## Abstract
A device for connecting a measuring instrument to a process duct 1 for process control mainly comprising one or more pressure ducts 5, 6 between measuring instrument 7 and process duct 1 , each pressure duct 5, 6 being connected by coupling means 3, 4 with the process duct and the measuring instrument respectively, wherein the coupling means 3, 4 comprise a coupling sleeve 13 to be fastened to the process duct 1 and the measuring instru ment 7 respectively and a releasable clamping socket 14 between the coupling sleeve and the pressure duct 5, 6 said sleeve being provided with an adapting stub 13 , whose outer diameter and hardness are equal to those of the pressure duct 5, 6 , whereby it is no longer necessary to form the pressure duct into shapes that can be bent only with difficulty, since it can be readily adapted to the proportioning of the process system and to the desired angle to the measuring instrument.
