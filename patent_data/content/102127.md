# R.F. circuit arrangement.

## Abstract
In an R.F. circuit with at least one R.F. transmission line 15, 13 comprising a ground plane 13 on an insulating substrate 3 and with two diodes 24, 25 respectively D.C. connected to two portions 38, 39 of the ground plane 13 mutually D.C. isolated by a slot 37 therein to enable the diodes 24, 25 to be biased, the substrate 3 is mounted in a housing 1, 2 of conductive material, and the two portions 38, 39 of the ground plane 13 are mutually R.F. coupled via the conductive material, one of the portions 39 being conductively connected to an adjacent housing member 2 and the other portion 38 being separated therefrom by a thin insulating layer. The slot 37 is such as to inhibit coupling of R.F. energy out of the circuit into the slot 37 , suitably being very narrow, e.g. 20 Âµm, so as to form a further transmission line with a very low characteristic impedance and also to have a high attenuation along its length for operation at mm wavelengths.
