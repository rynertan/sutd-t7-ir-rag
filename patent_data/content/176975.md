# Programmable universal synchronization byte dectector.

## Abstract
A programmable synchronization byte detector in a disk controller includes a shift register for serially receiving and shifting in the register a stream of bits read out from a disk unit, a processor for generating a plurality of select signals, a register for storing and making available over a time period one of the select signals, and a multiplexer receiving in input the parallel bit output of the shift register and transferring in output the select bit signal under control of the select signal received from the register. The signal in output from the multiplexer is used as synchronization signal for placing the disk controller in byte synchronization with the stream of bits received form the disk device.
