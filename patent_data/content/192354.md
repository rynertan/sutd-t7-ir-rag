# Method for thermally processing plastic food containers.

## Abstract
Methods are provided for thermally processing a plastic container having foodstuff therein to reduce softening and distortion of the plastic during thermal processing, wherein by combining the foodstuff with an acidulant and thereby reducing the pH of the foodstuff to 4.6 or below, the thermal processing time temperature parameter is reduced below what it would have been without the acidulant. Thanks to the reduced severity of processing, softening and distortion of the plastic is significantly reduced. Preferred acidulants are mixtures of lactone forming acids and their lactones, for example glucono delta lactone.

## Description
METHOD FOR THERMALLY PROCESSING PLASTIC FOODCONTAINERS This invention relates to the thermal processing of foodstuffs in plastic containers. More particuarly, the invention is directed to methods the consequences of which lead to substantially reduced distortion of plastic containers during thermal processing such that the resulting containers have an acceptable configuration. It is well known in the food packaging industry that foodstuffs are filled into metal or glass containers which are hermetically sealed and then thermally processed to sterilize the food to render it safe for human consumption. Thermal processing herein means subjecting the foodstuff in the container to a time temperature parameter which results in a commercially sterilized food, as defined inU.S. Title 21 CFH Part 113 Definitions, Section 11.3 . Commercial Sterility of thermally processed food means the condition achieved n i By the application of heat which renders the food free of a Microorganisms capable of reproducing in the food under normal nonrefrigerated conditions of storage and distribution and b Viable microorganisns including spores of public health significance or ii By the control of water activity and the application of heat, which render the food free of microorganisms capable of reproducing in the food under normal nonrefrigerated conditions of storage and distribution. Conventionally, thermal processing of foodstuffs in metal containers is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 1900F to about 2800F 88 138 C for from about several minutes to over six hours in various equipment such as rotary continuous cookers, still retorts and the like, and the containers are subjected to one of these cook cool cycles before they are discharged, stacked and packed for shipment and distribution. The highest processing temperatures are usually applied to low acid foods which provide better media for growth of microorganisms than do acid foods.Acid foods require less heat because lose microorganism era quite sensitive to acids.The preserving effect of acids is due to their hydrogen lon concentration and destabilisation effect on bacterial cells. Acid say be found in foods as a natural component, produced in foods by fersentation, or added to tood directly as a chesical. Since acid enhances the lethality of heat, acid foods pM 4.6 or below need only be heated generally up to about 205OY 2 such 1 much lower than the heat needed for foods of higher pH to render then free of spoilage organisms, Thus, there are certain foods, particularly low acid vegetables so.. of which are hereinafter enuserated which require thermal processing at i relatively high tenperature for a long period of tise high tile tesnerature processing parameter in in order to kill microorganisms responsible for food spoilage and toxicity. Much effort has been expended to packaging foods in plastic containers as a substitute for petal and glass containers. Plastic containers are desirable because they provide advantages of low cost, light weight, lack of rust and corrosion problems, and ease of disposability.Metal and glass containers commonly used for packaging and preserving foodstuffs have no difficulty in withstanding thermal processing temperatures which are higher than about 190 F and isportntly they can easily withstand the highest thermal processing or retorting temperatures used co ercially 135 to 138 C currently around 2750F to 230 F without permanent distortion or loss of hermetic seals Rigid plastic containers however, for example those made of olefinic structural material such as polyethylene, polypropylene or blends thereof, soften increasingly as the elevated thermal processing temperature increases and as the materials approach their respective elating points. Por a typical 135C high density polyethylene themelting point is about 275 F, and 166 C for a hosopolyser of polypropylene it Is about 330 F while softened, the plastic distends and tends to distort due to relative interna Vexternal pressures and handling. ln conventional thermal processing of plastic containers, unless various thermal processing factors are very closely controlled, the container, upon cooling, will be permanently distorted and therefore have an unacceptable configuration.One reason that the softened plastic at the elevated thermal processing teaperature distorts is that the pressure within the container during thermal processing exceeds the external pressure, i.e. the pressure in the equipment in which the process is carried out. The internal pressure against the plastic wall causes the wall to distend outwardly. Factors which contribute to increasing the internal pressure within the container are that the small amount of air or other gases usually present in the hernetically sealed container head space above the food level in the container undergo significant increases in volume and pressure at the elevated temperatures.Additionally, internal pressures also develop due to thermal expansion of the product, increased vapor pressures of the products, the dissolved gases present within the foodstuff contents and the gases generated by chemical reactions in the product during its cooking cycle. Thus, the total internal pressure within the container during thermal processing is the sum total of all of the aforementioned pressures. When this pressure exceeds the external pressure, the container distorts outwardly, thereby tending to expand the gases in the head space and thereby reducing the pressure differential relative to the external pressure.Usually, attempts are made to assure that the external pressure always exceeds the internal pressure such as by processing the filled container in a water sediua with an Over pressure of air sufficient to compensate for the internal pressure. This is one of the means used to process foods packed in well known flexible film packages such as the retort pouch. Also, external pressure in a steaa retort can be increased by adding air to the steal. However, this reduces heating efficiency of the steam and can alter heat transfer within the retort. When the container is cooled, pressure within the container decreases relative to the external pressure and conseqently the side wall nd or the bottom vall of the plastic container distends invardly to compensate for the reduction in pressure Cooling also tends to rigidify the plastic. This can cause the container to be permanently distended outwardly and or inwardly. It is well recognized that major problems in developing rigid thermally processubl plastic containers and in developing methods for thermally processing foodstuffs In such containers have been distortion and leakage of the plastic containers during processing and the compleilty and criticality involved in controlling the filling of the containers, the amOunt of hendepace, relative internal and external pressures, cooling rate, handling and other factors which affect distortion and strength of the container walls and whether or not the distorted walls become permanently deformed in unacceptable configurations. Such deformations can be side wall bulging, side wall panelling buckling of the side wall inwardly , and or outward distortion of the container bottom wall referred to as bulging1 or rocker bottom . These deformations and distortions may be unsightly, may interfere with proper stacking of the containers during shipment, and ay cause them to rock and be unstable when placed on flat surfaces.Any such deformation may be perceived as r possible indication of spoilage of the food contents, thus resulting in rejection of the container by the consumer.Unless these distortions and deformities and related problems are eliminated or substantially reduced, it will be difficult to develop and provide low cost, universally satisfactory commercially thermally processable rigid plastic containers for foodstuffs as viable commercial alternatives to thermally processable metal and glass containers. problem associated vith controlling the headspace within a narrow range to limit or control internal gas and pressure formation to within acceptable levels is that foodstuff filling equipment does not always fill the container with precisely the same amount of food, all plastic containers are not always exactly of the same dimensions and capacity, and there say be spillage. Because of these factors, the headspace above a foodstuff in a plastic container can vary during a run, and can be difficult to control within a narrow range.The narrowness and criticality of allowable headspace range has been a particular problem which has contributed to the overall complexity of the thermal processing of plastic containers, and has made commercial thermal processing of plastic containers difficult. A problem associated with the high temperatures of conventional thermal processing is that at the higher retorting temperatures the plastic is softer and waker, and the plastic is more easily stressed. One result is that the container at those temperatures tends not to have sufficient crush resistance to withstand many containers being stacked thereon during still retorting. For example, in a test simulating 14 layers of cans, the bottom most layer was evaluated. The cans were subjected to a still cook at 250 C F for 65 minutes. All 16 cans of the bottom layer were severely crushed and were deemed to be unacceptable for commercial use. In a second test at 2450 F for 75 minutes, all cans exhibited slight crushing.In a third test, at 2400F for 90 minutes, all 16 cans were examined and none exhibited crushing.Thus, the lower the still retort temperature, the greater the crush resistance of the containers on the bottom row and the greater is their ability to withstand the weight of containers stacked over them. Another result is that those containers whose walls are not manufactured to have good uniform material distribution or have thin or weak spots, vill, due to the internal pressures, be first and or excessively stressed and distended in those areas, relative to other more uniformly thick areas. Thus, plastic containers intended for thermally processing foods at the higher temperatures require a greater degree of uniformity in material distribution than containers intended to be processed at the lower temperatures. Still another problem involved in thermal processing of plastic containers, rigid or flexible, is that the hermetic seals may rupture. At high enough temperatures, if the previously rigid body book softens enough, it may unfold from the double seam and cause the metal end to blow off. Hermetic seals formed by use of beat ring adhesives made of lower melting polymers, may also rupe re under the influence of internal and external forces developed at the elevated thermal processing temperatures, e.g.above 240 0F. Although it is recognized that it may be possible to make plastic containers from highly riqid resins with sufficient thickness in the side and bottom walls, and or to use higher melting polymers and rbhrrlvrr to better withstand the temperatures and pressures developed during thermal processing, practical considerations such as costs associated with the greater amounts of these resins, the increased weight, the decreased thermal conductivity, increased plastic container manufacturing time heating, cooling, etc. , and other factory militate against use of this approach. Another approach to thermally processing foodstuffs in plastic containers is to maintain the thermal processing temperature at a level low enough that the polymers do not soften significantly. However this approach requires significantly longer processing times to achieve the same level of commercial sterility of the foodstuff. The extended times produce no relative energy cost savings, increased the reduces throughput in the equipment and often, particularly with respect to low acid foodstuffs, they will result in the foodstuff being of poorer quality in terms of its texture, color and flavor. The extended thermal process tends to overcook the foodstuff compared to the quality of the same foodstuffs processed at higher temperatures for shorter times. In view of the aforementioned problems, it would be desirable and it is an object of this invention to provide methods of thermally processing foodstuffs in plastic containers, both rigid and flexible, which would overcome or substantially reduce these problems wholly or in part. Accordingly, this invention seeks to facilitate the thermal processing of plastic food containers packed with foodstuff ac as to yield processed plastic containers which nave acceptible configurations. its invention seeks to reduce the temperature needed to thermally process foodstuffs in plastic containers to thereby alleviate the problems associated with softening of plastic at the usual, more elevates tt.erra processing temperatures so as to reduce the problems o plastic container wa 1 distortion and of the permanently deformed configurations associated therewith. We have striven by this invention to reduce the thermal processing time temperature parameters, especially the temperature, as well as the energy utilized as well as to maintain throughput in thermal processing of plastic containers packed with foodstuffs. An advantage of the lower thermal processing temperatures and parameters possible according to this invention is that they enable the use of thinner plastic containers, and permit the foodstuff thermally processed in a plastic container to have at least the same quality as that provided in a metal or glass container along with the advantages attendant in having containers made of plastic rather than metal or glass. This invention can facilitate the thermal processing of foodstuffs in plastic containers by increasing the headspace range with respect to which and within which a foodstuff can be successfully and easily filled and thermally processed in a plastic container. Thanks to the invention, the thermal process and the reformation of distorted plastic container walls are less complicated and less critical. Better plastic container performance and strength during thermal processing can be attained by effecting the process at lower temperatures, yielding processed plastic containers having commercially acceptable, aesthetic, physical and performance characteristics. It is an aim of this invention to provide a method of thermally processing foodstuffs in plastic containers at lower temperatures than without an acidulant, whereby the acidulated foodstuff has one or more improved organoleptic qualities, such that the total organoleptic effect is as pleasing or more pleasing than it would be if the same product were processed at higher parameters without an acidulant. The invention meets its objectives for example by using as the acidulant a mixture of an acid and its lactones, whereby the acid lowers the pH to 4.6 or below, and the amount and type of acid employed are such that it does not impart an objectionable acid taste such as the strong, sharp, pungent, sour, or pickled flavor associated with acids commonly used in foods. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of thermally processing a plastic food container having a foodstuff therein, e.g. an acid or low acid foodstuff, which comprises combining the foodstuff with an acidulant in an amount sufficient to reduce its equilibrium pH to 4.6 or below, hermetically sealing the container, and thermally processing the foodstuff in the container. The invention also provides a method for substantially reducing the time and or temperature to which a plastic container is subjected during thermal processing of a foodstuff hermetically sealed therein, said foodstuff e.g. being an acid or a low acid foodstuff, which comprises combining the foodstuff with an acidulant in an amount sufficient to reduce its equilibrium pH to 4.6 or below, hermetically sealing the container with the acidulated foodstuff therein, and thermally processing the container at a time and or temperature which is reduced and which thereby reduces softening and distortion of the plastic container during the thermal process, relative to the time temperature which would have been employed and the consequent increased softening and distortion of the plastic container which would have occurred if the foodstuff were not so acidulated. Further the invention provides, a method for substantially reducing the softening and distortion of a plastic container during thermal processing of a foodstuff hermetically sealed therein, said foodstuff e.g. being an acid or a low acid foodstuff, which comprises combining the foodstuff with an acidulant in an amount sufficient to reduce its equilibrium pH to 4.6 or below, and thermally processing the foodstuff in the container at a time temperature parameter substantially lower than possible if said equilibrium pH were above 4.6 during said thermal processing, said reduced time temperature parameter being responsible for reducing the side and bottom wall distortion of said container. Also, there is provided a method of thermally processing a foodstuff in a rigid plastic container with minimal plastic softening and distortion during thermal processing, said foodstuff e.g.being an acid or a low acid foodstuff, which comprises filling the container with foodstuff and acidulant in an amount to lower the equilibrium pH to 4.6 or less hermetically sealing the container and subjecting the sealed contents to a time temperature parmeter sufficient to commercially sterilize the contents the temperature of said parameter being lower than the higher temperature commercial sterilizing parmeter needed when the acidulant is not present, the lowered temperature parameter being primarily responsible for the reduced softening and distortion compared to the higher parameter. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a hermetically sealed plastic container containing an acid foodstuff of commercial sterility and an acidulant which imparts to the foodstuff an equilibrium pH below what it was prior to its having been combined with the acidulant, the foodstuff having an improved organoleptic quality as compared to the organoleptic quality which the commercially sterile foodstuff would have had, had it not been combined with the acidulant. Tunis invert ion provides avantager over conventional thermal processing of plastic containers in that the lower thermal processing temperatures permitted by the invention create less internal gas build up and less internal pressure against the container walls. Therefore there is less stress and diatention of the plastic walls and fewer chances of the container bursting, rupturing, leaking or permanently distending beyond the container material s elastic limit. Further, the lower temperatures greatly facilitate the thermal process and make it much easier to reform the container walls to an acceptable configuration.The allowable headspace range is broader and less critical, and the control of the relative internal external pressures is less critical, there being less need, if any, for over pressure cooling. In terms of container performance during processing at the lower temperatures wherein the plastic is not as soft, the plastic and the container are stronger and can resist more stress. Thus, at the lower processing temperatures in a still retort, containers exhibit better resistance to crushing and more containers can be placed on top of one another thereby increasing the retort output. Also, container wall uniforn material distribution is not as critical. In terms of economy, the thermal processing apparatus can be simpler in that overpressure cooling apparatus may not be needed. Retorts not already equipped for overpressure cooling can now be utilized Since the thermal processing and cooling times can be reduced, and since, for example, more containers can be still retorted due to increased stacking, there can be economies through the increased thermal processing output. Economies can also be obtained by using thinner wall constructions or less expensive, weaker structural materials. With respect to inprovements in terms of the foodstuffs processable in plastic containers, since less gas is evolved at the lower temperatures, it is easier to thermally process products which tend to evolve greater amounts of gas such as corn, dried beans, and dried bean products such as chile with beans which heretofore were more problematical in plastic containers at the higher temperatures.The lower thermal processing parameters of this invention permit the thermal processing in plastic containers of heat sensitive foodstuffs such a. low Kid heat sensitive vegetables which, due to the higher conventional thermal processing temperatures nd or longer times, tend to degrade in organoleptic qualities texture, i.e. firmness and compositional integrity, color, flavor, and aroma . Using the method of this invention, these vegetables are less overcooked, less flaccid and more firm, the color tends to be brighter, and the flavor improved, all relative to the same products processed at the higher temperatures for the same length of time or longer. Also, foodstuffs processed in plastic containers at the lower temperatures have organoleptic properties closer to the fresh or properly booe cooked product than the same products thermally processed at the highterOvtimeXtemperature parameters.When the preferred acidulants re employed, Basking of the fresh natural flavor of the foodstuff by an objectionable acid taste is minimized or eliminated. Reducing the temperature to which plastic containers are subjected during thermal processing to low enough levels might permit the use of other thermoplastics which as structural materials, would soften and melt at lower temperatures than the hereinafter blends used in Ixample I Such a material when employed with an oxygen barrier layer such as an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, a vinylidene chloride copolymer, nylon or other layer which is a better oxygen barrier than the structural layers may advantageously provide a potential for less expensive rigid plastic packages for thermally sterilized food products than currently available. Reducing the thermal processing temperatures for multi layer plastic containers having an inner moisture sensitive oxygen barrier layer. such as made of an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer material1 would reduce or eliminate the need for a drying agent to he incorporated in a layer of the structure to protect the barrier from moisture see U.S. Patent flo. 4,407,l97 , since depending on the level of the lower processing temperature, there will be less or little permeation of moisture through the outer structural polyethylene or polypropylene layers to the barrier layer during retorting.With less or little permeation there is less of a need for a drying agent to absorb the permeated moisture. Te invention will be Further exrained In more detail in the following non imitative descrip 5on In accordance with this invention, r method is provided for thermally processing plastic containers with foodstuff therein, at lower temperatures than heretofore conventionally practiced.More particularly, a method is provided for substantially reducing side and bottom wall distortion of a plastic container during thermal processing of a foodstuff hermetically sealed therein, which comprises combining the foodstuff with an acidulant in an amount sufficient to reduce the equilibrium pB of the foodstuff and contents to 4.6 or below, and thermally processing the foodstuff in the plastic container at a time temperature parameter sufficient to achieve commercial sterilization of the foodstuff yet substantially lower than otherwise possible from a commercial sterility standpoint if said acidulant vere not added and said equilibrium pB were above 4.6 during thermal processing.The lower temperature parameter substantially reduces the side and bottom wall distortion of the container during thermal processing, greatly facilitates the thermal process and cooling process and the control of their parameters and results in a thermally processed plastic container having an acceptable configuration. Although the invention applies with respect to any foodstuff and any acidulant appropriate for reducing the equilibrium pH as aforesaid without significantly deleteriously affecting the flavor of the food, the invention is especially applicable to low acid foodstuffs that normally require high processing temperatures to render them shelf stable and especially those low acid foodstuffs which are heat sensitive in the sense that they are susceptible to degradation in texture, color or flavor due to the more severe conventional thermal processing parameters and conditions.The preferred acidulant is a mixture of an acid and its lactones, preferably an aldonic acid and its lactones, e.g. 9 mixture of gluconic acid and glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone, preferably provided to the foodstuff by combining the foodstuff with glucono delt lactone CDL , which hydrolyzes and form, a mixture of gluconic acid and its aforementioned lactones because it is effective in reducing the equilibrium pH of low acid foodstuffs to 4.6 or below vithout imparting a strong, harp, pungent, pickled or acidic taste more commonly associated vith other acidulants such as acetic, citric, lactic, maleic, tartaric, and phosphoric acids which are commonly used in foods. The descriptior. which follows is given by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings. wherein like numerals are employed to designate like parts Figure IA is a front elevational view partly in section, of an open ended cylindrical plastic container before the container is packed with food and sealed according to this invention Figure lB is a front elevational view partly in section, of the container shown in Figure IA after the container has been filled with food and sealed under partial vacuum Figure 1C is a front elevational view partly in section, of the container shown in Figure B during thermal processing but before reforming, showing bulging of the container bottom wall, Figure lD is a front elevational view partly in section, of the container shown in Figure 1C illustrating rocker bottom after thermal processing, Figures 1E is a front elevational view partly in sectior., of a container similar to Figure lD but wherein the container SidewailS are panelled Figure 1F is a cross sectional viev taken along line 1F IF through the container shown in Figure lE Figures 1G is a front elevational view partly in section, of the container shown in Figure 1A illustrating sidewall panelling and bottom bulgln9s Figure 1H is a front elevational view partly in section, of the container shown in Figure lA after thermal processing, according to the present invention and having a commercially acceptable configuratlonz and Figures 2 to X each show representative parameter curves for thermally processing r different low acid foodstuff to commercial sterility, the curves to the right illustrating conventional parameters needed without an acidulant, the curves to the left illustrating parameters needed by using an acidulant, i.e.the preferred CDL, in combination with a foodstuff in accordance with this invention, Figure 2 being for yellow squash, Figure 3 carrots, Figure 4 green beans, Figure 5 green peas, Figure 6 corn, and Figure 7 lasagna. In accordance with this invention, the foodstuff to be thermally processed in the plastic container is combined with an acidulant, the amount of the acidulant being sufficient to reduce the equilibrium pfl of the foodstuff contents to 4.6 or below in the plastic container prior to thermal processing. By equilibrium pE is meant the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration of the blended product, taken in accordance with CrR 114.80 a 1 , 2 and CER 114.90, each incorporated herein by reference, but in any case taken not more than 24 hours after completion of the thermal process, i.e. when the application of heat is terminated. The foodstuffs which can be thermally processed in plastic containers in accordance with this invention can be any foodstuffs, regardless of the level of its acidity, d.e. acid, acidified, or low acid. Thus, the invention is applicable to any acid foodstuff naturally or otherwise already having a pB 4.6 or below, the acidulant being added to increase the acidity even further to thereby enable the thermal process to be conducted at r still lower time temperature parameter which has even less an effect on the plastic of the container. The invention is, however, more particularly directed to low acid foodstuffs having a pH above 4.6, regardless of whether the foodstuff is particulary sensitive to heat in terms of degradation of texture, flavor and or color.Examples of low acid foodstuffs are seafood including fish and shrimp , meats, meat products including chili and beef stew , vegetables, cereal grains e.g. rice and cereal grain based products including fried rice, Spanish rice and other rice products and pastas including lasagna, ravioli and spaghetti .Low acid foodstuffs often require severe thermal processing to achieve commercial 250 sterility, that is, a high temperature, e.g. above Assay to 138 C 2800F for a long time to kill microorganisms responsible for food spoilage and toxicity, and, for some products also to obtain sufficient tenderixation. In general, commercial sterilization teiperatures and times employed for commercial sterilization of low acid foodstuffs packed in metal containers has ranged from about 110 135 C 2300F to about 275 F , for about from 10 minutes to about 6 hours, the times and temperatures being selectable depending upon the type, amount, conductivity, thermal death time requirement, and initial temperature of the food product, the size of the container, type of sterilization process used, the type of and operating parameters of the equipment employed, as well as energy costs and the throughput desired. For those low acid foods for example, peas and corn which are not particularly heat sensitive when packed in c small to medium sized containers, e.g. 303x406d, e.g. corn, in the sense that relatively speaking it can withstand more heat prior to degrading than many other vegetables , a high temperature, short 135 C cook, e.g. 275 F for just enough time to achieve commercial sterility and tenderize the kernels, e.g. an agitated cook of about 10 minutes, is usually employed because it provides quick throughput and good flavor and texture.However, most low acid foodstuffs are usually processed at lower temperatures of fros about 240 0F to 2550F 116 12XcC about 255 F for from about 15 to 50 minutes. High temperature, long cooks can tend to cause the most heat sensitive of the low acid products to degrade in quality as to texture. in terms of their losing their firmness being overly softened and losing their integrity, as to flavor by having an overcooked or caramelized taste, and as to color by king darkened as compared to the freshly harvested product. The heat sensitive products also tend to lose aone nutritional value. Examples of naturally acid foodstuffs include tomatoes, tomato products, most fruits and berries. Examples of low acid foodstuffs which might be considered heat sensitive for one reason or another include cereal grains, meats and neat products, beans including lima, kidney, snap beans, e.g. blue lake, green and wax , and snap bean products e.g. bean salads , dried bean products including baked beans, chili , beets, certain seafoods e.g. shrimp , yellow squash, zucchini, pumpkin due to its poor conductivity in large containers, e.g. 603x700, it darkens due to the need for a long cook time for sterilization , carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, melons, eggplant, stir fry Chinese vegetables, cabbage, pasta, celery, mushrooms, olives and onions, and food combinations including one or more of such vegetables Of the above foodstuffs, squash, zucchini, melons, artichokes, cauliflower and celery are very heat sensitive. Acidulants are added to foodstuffs to permit thermal processing of the plastic containers in which they are contained to be effected at lower processing temperatures because of the aforementioned effect of the acid on acid sensitive microorganisms and its effect on destabilizing bacterial cells. The presence of the acid enhances the lethality of the heat with respect to such microorganisms and cells. The acidulant is combined with the foodstuff in a conventional manner. If the acid is in solid form, such as granular, it may be sprinkled on the food or intimately mixed therewith The most preferred procedure is to include the acid in an aqueous solution, called a brine, which is included with the food in the container.With respect to low acid foodstuffs, the amount of acid explored is that which is sufficient to reduce the equilibrium pH of the fooc contents to be thermally sterilized to 4.6 or below. Te amount is in part dictated by the pH sought to be obtained and in part by the desired resulting taste of the thermally processed foodstuff. Too much acid would tend to provide the foodstuff with a strongly acidic taste. Typical acids added to foodstuffs include acetic, citric, maleic, etc. The acids create a distinct pickled flavor. In many instances, the taste of these acids deleteriously detracts from or masks the natural flavor of the product.Thus, pickled beets would have a superior color and texture compared to non acidified canned beets, but they would not taste like fresh beets. The preferred acidulant to be combined with the foodstuff is a mixture of an acid end its lactones, preferably a mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones. The preferred aldonic acid is gluconic acid. It is a mild organic acid which has a mild acid taste. The aldonic acids which can be combined with the foodstuff in accordance with this invention are prepared for example by oxidation of sugars or aldoses, preferably from those having six carbon atoms, although they could be prepared from those having five carbon atoms. Those acids prepared from sugars having six carbon atoms are talonic, galactonic, idonic, gulonic, mannonic, gluconic, altronic and allonic although currently these acids, vith the exception of gluconic, may be unavailable commercially .These acids are respectively derived from their aldoses talose, galactose, idose, gulose, mannose, glucose, altrose and allose. Sugars having five carbon atoms are lyxose, xylose, arabinose and ribose. Those skilled in the art will understand from this disclosure regarding six and five carbon atom aldonic acids, that other acids which form their own lactones and mixtures of other acids and their lactones, which perform the same functions and objectives of this invention, particularly regarding lowering the pH and regarding lack of an objectionable acid taste in the processed foodstuff. would be within the scope of this invention For exule, aldaric acids, i.e.dibasic acids such as glucaric which forms saccharo lactone, might be employed. Any suitable method or material can be employed to bring the aldonic acid and its lactones into combination with the foodstuff.While the acid might be added by itself since the acid, when in contact with moisture or water in the foodstuff, will be converted to a mixture of the acid and its lactones , doing so currently is probably not practical since, so far as we know, alconis acids are not known to to be coercislly available in crystalline tore or in food grade.This is the case with the preferred gluconic acid. There acids mry be coinwerically available in technical grade in aqueous solutions.For example, gluconic acid is so available in aqueous solutions stated to be about 50 by weight gluconic acid. These aqueous solutions of the acid are equilibrium mixtures of gluconic acid and its lactones, glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone.Gluconic acid has a mild acid taste. The preferred method for providing the aldonic acid and its lactones to the foodstuff is to combine the foodstuff with a precursor of the aldonic acid. A precursor of the acid herein means a liquid, material or compound which adds the acid to, or forms or provides it in the foodstuff with which it is combined. Again, when the acid contacts moisture or water in or of the foodstuff, it will convert partially to and will co exist with its lactones.Precursors of these acids which can be employed include their lactones themselves which can be said to be latent acids since they hydrolyze in water to form a mixture of the acid and its lactones , mixtures of these lactones, and salts of the acids in combination with certain strong acids. For example, precursors of the preferred gluconic acid which can be employed include glucono delta lactone, glucono gas a lactone, mixtures of these lactones, and gluconate salts in combination with the strong acid, hydrochloric. By far, the most preferred precursor for this invention is glucono delta lactone GDL . When used in powdered form, the taste of the powder is initially sweet, and thereafter as it hydrolyses, the taste becomes mildly acidic.Of course, when CDL is employed in increasingly large amounts, the foodstuff would tend to taste increasingly acidic, although less acidic than with equivalent amounts of one of the aforementioned acids commonly used in foodstuffs. CDL is preferred because it results in significantly less detraction from or masking of the natural flavor and has less of an acid taste than acids commonly used in foods.Use of an acidulant such a. GDL has an added advantage with respect to acid foods in the sense that it permits their thermal processing in plastic containers at time temperature parameters even lower than otherwise possible within acceptable limits from a commercial sterility viewpoint without the addition of the GDL and with less of an effect on taste than most other acids would produce GDL is commercially available in food grade as a free flowing, odorless, white powder. Food grade solutions of GDL are also commercially available and can be employed. CDL is an inner ester of gluconic acid which when hydrolyzed forms gluconic acid. Hydrolysis occurs when GDL is combined with water, for example that of an aqueous brine or in the foodstuff.Hydrolysis of the glucono delta lactone results in an equilibrium mixture of from about 55t to about 608 by weight gluconic acid and from about 451 to about 40t by weight of a mixture of glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone. The rate of acid formation during hydrolysis is affected by the temperature, the pH value and concentration of the solution.Hydrolysis of delta lactones tends to be more rapid than hydrolysis of gamma lactones. In the absence of heat, hydrolysis tends to be slow. Heating the brine accelerates the hydrolysis reaction and it the preferred method. Beating the foodstuff also has the same effect. Like results would be expected to occur with the use of lactones of other aldonic acids, e.g. galactono delta lactone. For this invention, rapid hydrolysis through heating is preferred to help acidify the particulate foodstuff rapidly and thoroughly. Examples of those salts which can be used in combination with certain strong acids each suitable for food use , include sodium, potassium and calcium salts, for example, sodium, potassium ana calcium gluconates. An example of an acid considered herein to be strong is one which will react with the acid salt and provide enough available hydrogen ions to form the desired aldonic acid and its lactones in the foodstuff. Such an acid would be hydrochloric. Of course, the type, manner and or amount of strong acid s elrioyed should be such that in accordance vith the objectives of thls invention, a sharp, strong or objectionable acid taste is not imparted to the foodstuff. If hydrochloric acid is used as the strong acid, all of it should be converted so that no such acid would remain, only some derived salt.This invention does not preclude the addition of other ingredients with the acidulant to the foodstuff acid combination. For example, small mounts of other acids, for example citric may be added with GDL to the combination, usually in the brine for example to overcome the buffering action resistance to a change in pH of certain vegetables, such as asparagus , the amount preferably being minor and below that which would deleteriously affect or mask the taste of the foodstuff.Also salt, sugar, and or other ingredients may be added to the brine solution or added separately for example tor flavor, according to conventional practice. The plastic containers are filled with the foodstuff acid lactone combination and the containers are hermetically sealed, for example by a conventional double seam, typically either under e vacuum or in an atmosphere of steam by hot filling or by passing steam at the container top while sealing. The sealed container is then thermally processed at a temperature of 190 C 1 usually Icrr 190 F or higher usually less than about 240 F depending upon the factors previously mentioned, to sterilize the container and contents. Thereafter, the container and contents are cooled to ambient temperature, stored and shipped for distribution. The methods of this invention can be more fully understood by reference to the Drawings and Examples. Reference is now made toFigures 1 through 1H in relation to understanding plastic distortion problems associated with thermal processing plastic containers. There is shown in Figure 1A an open ended plastic container 1 having sidewalls 3 and a bottom wall 5 which includes a substantially flat portion 7 and outer and inner convex annular rings 9 and 9a with an interstitial ring 9b. After the container is filled, it is sealed vith r top closure 11 as shown in Figure 1B, leaving at the container top, a headspace of gases generally designated 13. The containers shown in the drawings are not to be taken as limiting of the scope of the invention, since the containers can be rigid or flexible. Likewise, the top closure shown is not to be limiting in that it can be rigid or flexible and it can be made of any suitable material, for example, metal, plastic or a combination thereof. Figure 1C shows container 1 during thermal processing, or after thermal processing but before bottom reforming. As shown in this Figure, the container bottom is outwardly distended because the pressure within the container exceeds the external pressure If no proper prior measures are taken, after the container is cooled, the bottom wall may remain deformed as shown in Figure lD. Such a container configuration is unstable or undesirable due to rocker bottom.As will hereinafter be explaine 5, rocker bottoms Figure 1D and sidewall panelling as shown in Figures 1E and 1F, or both Figure 1G , may he minimized or prevented by utilizing the method of this invention wherein lower commercial sterilization processing temperatures nd or times say be employed. For r full discussion of thermal processing food containers at elevated temperatures, the problems involved and solutions to the problems, see U. S. Application Serial No. 6 627,703 filed on July 3, 1984 assigned to ourselves The disclosure of Serial No. 627,703 is incorporated herein by reference. Figure 18 represents a desired acceptable container configuration after thermal processing and reforming of the container because it has no rocker bottom or sidewall panelling.This container configuration is the same or nearly the same as the configuration shown in Figure 1B The present invention and its advantages will nov be explained with reference to the following Examples and associated illustrativeFigures. For Example 1, the foodstuff was contained in 211 x 215 2 11 16 in diameter, by 2 15 16 high multi layer injection blow molded rigid plastic containers constructed of the following five layers an outer layer of a 40 60 blend of high density polyethylene and polypropylene, an adhesive layer of a blend of graft copolymers of maleic anhydride and propylene wherein the maleic anhydride pieties are grafted onto the respective polypropylene chains the blend being comprised of 50 Adder OF 500, 25 OF 550 and 25t of other ingredients including 16s disodium phosphate the Admers are sold by Mitsui Petrochemical Industries,Ltd. an oxygen barrier layer of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer EVOH sold under the trade designation EVAL EPT by Kuraray Co.,Ltd. , another adhesive layer of the previously mentioned material, and an inner structural layer of the blend of htgh density polyethylene and polypropylene.The average thickness of the 0.20mn 0.79 mn container side wall was .031 Inch and of the bottom wall was .011 inch bottom wall measurements were taken at about the tlp of the arrow of lead line for Wumber 9 in Figure 1E . t is to be understood, however, that the nature of the different layers or whether the plastic container has only one layer or another number of layers, or is of different wall thicknesses, is not per Se critical, since the advantages of the lower thermal processing parameters of this invention for the plastic container can be realized for any single plastic container made of another number of layers, another or other plastic material s , and of different wall thicknesses. Example 1 Freshly harvested yellow squash, a low acld foodstuff, was 1.2 cm conventionally washed, sliced each slice approximately 1 2 thick , 93 C and blanched for five minutes in water at about 200 F a conventional treatment primarily to stop enzyme action , the blanch being terminated by a cold water rinse. The blanched sliced yellow squash was filled into a series of the 211 x 215 multi layer rigid 142 S plastic containers to a fill weight of S ounces.Some of the cans were filled with a brine which was an aqueous solution formed by adding 25.5 grams of GDL and 35 grams of salt in 3 liters of water 82 C heated to 180 F The initial fill temperature of the container 43 C contents vas about 110 F and the contents had an equilibrium pH of less than 4.6, namely 4.2. Employing a heated brine helps to rapidly hydrolyze the GDL, which is a benefit. As previously mentioned, when GDL is hydrolyzed, it forms an equilibrium mixture of gluconic acid, glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone. Although it is not necessary to heat the brine, heating it is preferred. The cans were hermetically sealed leaving a headspace cf 3 16 inch, and thermally processed in accordance with this invention to achieve commercial sterility in a still retort at minutes to reach a can center temperature CCT of 205 F. At the 96 C end of the 15 minute cook, when a CCT 205 F had been reached, steam flow into the still retort was terminated. The Steam was then vented to the atmosphere, and, via a bottom fill, cooling water at about 70 F was introduced into the retort to cool the containers 30C for about 5 minutes to about 100 F The water was drained and the containers were removed from the retort.Some of the containers were opened within 24 hours whereupon the equilibrium pH was determined. The resulting thermally processed yellow squash had a firm texture, a bright yellow color, a near fresh home cooked flavor, and the brine clarity drained was clear. The plastic containers containing the yellow squash thermally processed in Example 1, as would be expected, softened and distended some during the retort thermal processing, however, at 220 FXthe distention was minimal and significantly less than would have occurred at temperatures of 200p 160C IG C the CcT of 205 F was reached, overpressure cooling was not needed. During cooling, all containers reformed to a commercially acceptable configuration. Briefly, Figure 2 shows that when the yellow squash is acidulated to reduce its equilibrium pH tc 4.6 or below, the thermal processing time temperatures which can be employed to achieve commercial sterility of the foodstuff are greatly reduced. Before referring in more detail to Figure 2 and to Pigures 3 7, some general observations should be made about the Figures. In each one Figures 2 7 , speaking in general each curve to the right shows a parameter curve which gives an indication of the various time temperature combinations which will achieve commercial sterility of the particular foodstuff mentioned when thermally processed without an acidulant in a multi laytr plastic container of the size specified.These curves are based upon heat penetration characteristics data derived from a heat penetration test with the particular product and container size, and a certain time teperature data point along each right hand curve corresponds to time temperature thermal processing conditions actually used by the assignee of this invention in reaching commercially sterility with the specified foodstuff without GDL in the specified container size and retort.Each parameter curve to the left gives an indication of the various time temperature combinations calculated to achieve commercial sterility of the particular foodstuff mentioned when thermally processed with an acidulant in the same multi layer plastic container.The left curves are based upon the same heat penetration characteristics data as used for Its associated right hand curve but with the additional critical factor that foodstuff contents are acidified with an acidulant to have an equilibrium pH of 4.6 or below when thermally processed. The left hand curves are calculated to achieve a can center temperature CCT 9 C of 205 F which is sufficient for achieving commercial sterility of all acidified foods. It is to be noted that FIgures 2 7 are logarithmic and merely illustrative of the dramatic movement of the parameter to the left under this invention, and, therefore those skilled in the art will understand that the parameters illustrated are not precisely interpretable and are not to be used for selection of a particular actual thermal process time and temperature. Referring now to Figures 2 7 in greater detail, rigure 2 shows the shift to the left of a still retort thermal processing parameter curve to achieve commercial sterility of yellow squash, the shift being from the right curve figured at an Fo of 3.7 without an acidulant having been added, to the left curve calculated to achieve a can center temperature CCT of 205 F which is also sufficient to achieve commercial sterilization of the product, and which for this product would be equivalent to r calculated Fo of .01. Example 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate that the addition of an acidulant, here CDL, to a yellow squash foodstuff to be canned permits a significant reduction in the severity of the tbe aal process to achieve commercial sterility of the contents, in that the thermal processing temperature, as well as the time, are significantly reduced with respect the heat sensitive plastic material of which the container is made. The scope of the change can be appreciated by reference to Figure 2.In achieving the same the state of sterilization, for the same product in the same container with the same retort, whereas the right curve shows that without practicing this invention, the thermal process to which the plastic would be subjected typically would be about 240 F for about 36 to 40 minutes, the left curve shows that under this 104 C invention the plastic need only see 220 for about 15 minutes.It is to be noted that the chart clearly shows that for time through put, energy and economic reasons, as well as the increased likelihood of overcooking the product, it would be commercially impractical to process yellow squash in a plastic container at 154 C 220 0F without an ac dulant, for at that temperature it would take as long as 200 minutes to thermally process the same yellow squash. The temperature time parameters of each curve to the right in the Figures are based upon a particular sterilizing value Fo for the particular product which value here is basically a time equivalent calculated at 250 F Particular Fo values required to achieve commercially acceptable shelf stable sterility are highly variable depending upon type and size of the container, type and size of food product, acidity of the product and the like.Reference is directed to the publication Calculation of Processes for Canned Foods , Copyright 1967, American Can Company, which is anAmerican Can Company Technical Services Publication, for further information on this matter, and how F0 values are derived by those skilled in the art. The higher the F0 value, the greater the severity of the thermal process. Generally speaking, the lower the pE, the less severe the heat treatment required for thermal sterilization. Those skilled in the art of thermally processing foodstuffs hose heating characteristics have been established, can determine by known calculations available in the aforementioned Publication , a sterilizing value here, for example, CCT which will achieve commercial sterility for the acidulated product in question and the type of retort or process to be employed.For products which heretofore never have been commercially sterilized and canned or for which no heating characteristics have been developed, it is recom3endeo that an established thermal processing authority such as the assignee of this invention be consulted to obtain a sterilizing value here again, for example, CCT which will achieve commercial sterility for the equilibrium pH of the particular acidulated product contents to be processed. For all products whose 9 C equilibrium pR have been lowered to 4.6 or below. a CCT ot 205 F , can be employed for commercial sterility. Should It be desired to use r CCT of less than 205 F an aformentioned authority should be consulted to determine whether the lower CCT temperature would be sufficient to obtain commercial sterility The can or container center tesperature eCT is determined by implanting a thermocouple into the container prior to its being hermetically sealed and tested. CcT herein means the temperature at the slowest heating point of the food product in the container which, depending on the food product, may be but not necessarily is the actual center point of the container. Figure 3 shows the shift to the left of a still retort processing parameter curve 1a1c.h3i v commercial sterility of diced carrots in 401 x 407 thersoformed multi layer rigid plastic containers, the shift being from the right curve wherein carrots were thermally processed at an Fo of 3.5 without an acidulant, to the left curve which is based on an initial fill temperature of 100 F scalculated to achieve a CCT of 205 F 96 C and which this product, would be equivalent to an Fo of .01.This curve indicates that whereas thermal processing of diced carrots would usually be conducted at say 240OF for but 30 minutes, using an acidulant combined with the food in accordance with this invention, 10X C the plastic containers need only be subjected to 220OF for 12 minutes It is to be noted that carrots are exemplary of a low acid foodstuff which is heat sensitive, and due to higher thermal 11 CX processing temperatures, e.g. 240 F for 30 minutes, the sterilized carrots suffer some degradation in organoleptic quality in that they exhibit a slightly darkened orange color, a slightly carmelized burnt flavor, and a slightly flaccid texture.By contrast, and in llne vith a specific objective of this invention, carrots processed 1OLCC vith an rcidula t at the lower temperature of 2200F for about 12 canutes exhibit a bright orange color, a sore fresh like flavor and a firm texture, and the overall organoleptic effect is improved despite the possibility of a slightly acidic flavor. Figure 4 shows the shift to the left of a still retort processing parameter curve for achieving commercial sterility of green beans in 303 x 406 multI layer rigid plastic containers, the shift being from the right curve with respect to which the green beans vere thermally processed at an Fo of 2.8 without an acidulant, to the left curve which is based on an initial fill 38 C temperature of 100 r, is calculated to achieve a CCT of 205 F 96 C and which for this product would be equivalent to an Fo of .01.Since commercial canning of green beans in metal cans often occurs 124 C at temperatures of 255 C reference to the right curve of Figure 4 indicates that at that temperature a process of approximately 17 1 x 11. 1 ez sinutes in 303 x 406Xplastic containers would be needed to reach commercial sterility in a still retort. At a retort temperature of 124 C 255 Fl container walls of polyolefin based materials such as polyethylene and other structural materials previously described will soften to the point where distortion or crushing can often occur, especially in the bottom layers of the retort.These problems could be reduced by selecting a process along the right 116 C hand curve vith a lower temperature parameter, say at 240 F.for 27 for 27 minutes. However, at this temperature, a retort overpressure during cooling would probably still be needed and the headspace and other container and process variables must be carefully controlled to avoid occasional distortion problems. Also, the longer cook, 27 minutes versus 17 minutes would reduce product throughput in the retort. A better solution to the elimination of plastic container distortion in this example would be to utilize an acidulant such asCDL according to the present invention, thus allowing the achievement of commercial sterility along the left curve in Figure 4. This would allow use of significantly lower retort temperatures 10h C and tiles such as, say, 220 for 12 minutes. This parameter significantly reduces plastic distortion, increases retort throughput 12 minutes vs. 17 or 27 minutes and produces canned beans with firmer texture and less of an overcooked or caramelized flavor, as vell as better retention of heat sensitive nutrients. Figure 5 shows the shift to the left which can be obtained in accordance with this invention of a still retort processing 8.1 x 11.1 co parameter curve for thermally sterilizing green peas in 303 5 406 multi layer rigid plastic containers, the shift being from the right curve wherein the thermal processing was effected at an tO of 6.0 without an acidulant, to the left curve which is based on an initial fill temperature of l000F an38d C5 calculated to achieve a cCT of 205 F which for this product, would be equivalent to an tO of 01 A comparison of the curves shows that whereas plastic containers packed with green peas would be thermally processed say at about 240 For about 53 minutes, an equivalent commercial sterility could be achieved with an acidulant in a plastic container which, according to this invention, would only be subjected to 104 C for about 11 minutes. As examples using a different retort, two packs were made with 8.1 x 11.1 cm green peas in 303 x 406 nulti layer rigid plastic cans which were thermally processed in a Steritort, which rotates the cans during cooking. For the first pack, a 260 F 15 inute cook was used. The packed cans had an acceptable configuration including g2ogod double seam integrity . The second pack, cooked at 265 F for 13 minutes to obtain faster throughput, was a failure because the double seams unrolled and destroyed the packages integrity. The curves and the above packs show that a better solution to the need for higher throughput would be to acidulate the green peas and process them at a temperature of 2200F 104 C . Example 2 Freshly harvested corn was conventionally washed and overblanched. 63 cc s of cold fiSt C9Qt4l iQg brine was filled into each of a series of 303 x 406 thef29Ooz ed, multi layer rigid plastic containers. 10.5 ounces of the blanched corn was added to i L7 g each of a series of the containers. Then, 5 weight ounces of 190 0F water was added to top the cans off leaving a headspace of 3 16 of an inch The containers were steam flow hermetically sealed and thermally processed in an agitated retort steritortt at a 6.3 1bx C RPM reel speed to achieve commercial sterility at 2550F for 20 minutes. The resulting thermally processed corn was of good quality. Although an overpressure of Zoo10 psi 0.69 bar was employed during cooling, due to poor material distribution in the container wall, w fair number of the thermally processed plastic containers were panelled and therefore did not have r commercially acceptable configuration. Figure 6 shows the shift to the left of an agitated retort processing parameter curve for commercially sterilizing corn, the shift being from the right curve with respect to which one data point represents wherein the corn was actually thermally processed in Example 2 at an Fo of at least 10. without an acidulant to the 36 C left curve which is based on an initial fill temperature of 1000F and calculated to achieve a can center temperature of 205 F which for this product would be equivalent to an Fo of .01.Again, whereas the plastic containers conventionally thermally processed in accordance with Example 2 were subjected to temperatures of about 124 C 255 F for about 20 minutes, an equivalent thermal sterilization of the product could be achieved in accordance with this invention by subjecting the q ers to about 230 F for about 8 minutes, or to about 220 F for about 10 minutes. Figure 7 shows the shift to the left which can be effected in accordance with this invention of a still retort processing parameter curve for commercially sterilizing lasagna, the shift being from the right curve wherein the lasagna thermally processed at an Fo of 8.3 without an acidulant, to 5ttcieft curve which is based on initial fill temperature 1000F and is calculated to 96 C achieve a CCT of 205 F, which for this product would be equivalent to an Fo of .03.The Figure shows that whereas the plastic container in which the lasagna would be commercially sterilized say at 240 F for about 100 minutes, an equivalent sterilization can be obtained with an acidulant in r plastic container which in accordance with this invention would only be subjected to 22001 104 C for about 48 minutes. Example 3 Canned lasagna is currently often thermally processed 116 C commercially in metal containers in still retorts at 240 F. The 121 C packer wants to process it at 250 F to achieve a higher throughput. With respect to plastic containers, test packs of lasagna were 6.8 x 7.4 cm prepared in the plastic cans of Example 1 i.e 211 x 215 and 1160C 1l80C 0 in 0 processed in a still retort both at 240 F nd at 245 using a 0.69 bar 10 psI air overpressure during the cooling stage. The cans were stacked 13 layers high. The lower cans easily support this load at room temperature. With respect to the cans of a crate which were 1 l80c processed in the retort at 245 F , for 80 minutes, the cans of the bottom 3 layers exhibited crushing of the bearing ring, just outward from the tip of the arrow of the lead line for No. 9 at the resting point of the container in Figure 1A . 116 C As for the cans of a crate which were processed at 2400F for 100 minutes, crushing was confined to the bottommost layer of the stack. Even though this is a longer cycle time, better can quality 116 C would necessitate using a 240 0F cook for non acidulated lasagna when using this type of retort. It can be seen from the right cure 121 C of Figure 7, the packer s objective of processing at 250 F to obtain a high throughput still requires a cook time of about 70 minutes and therefore the objective cannot be reached with these particular cans and this load in this type of retort.Bovever, the left curve of Figure 7 shows that vith acidulated lasagna, the objective can be met in that the process time can be reduced to 104 C about 48 minutes using a 2200F cook. Under these conditions, it can be seen that since the lower cans had significantly better crush 116 C 116 C 0 resistance at 240 than at 245 F , it is evident that at 220 F 104 C the lower cans will not crush and a fast cycle tire can be achieved. The multi layer rigid plastic containers used as a basis for calculating the curves of Figures 2 7 were five layer constructions whose layers were similar to those of the containers of Example 1 in that the outer and inner layers were blend of high density polyethylene and polypropylene, the barrier was an EVOKE material and the adhesive was not a blend of Admer materials but was a single adhesive material. with respect to the cook cycle techniques which would be employed In accordance with this invention, from the Start of the steam cook until the end of the cook when the steam is turned oer, the thermal processing technique other than with respect to temperatures snd times , which would be employed with respect to plastic containers, need not be but they can be basically the same as those which would be employed for thermally processing the respective foodstuffs in plastic or metal containers of the same size with or without an acidulant .With respect to temperatures and times, under this invention, if the conventional elevated temperature is not problematical due to either or both the foodstuff or the plastic container, within limits required for achieving commercial sterility, the time can be shortened to thereby achieve consequent increased throughput and obvious economic and energy savings If temperature is problematical to the product and or to the plastic, the temperature can be lowered as desired within limits required for commercial sterility and within limits of the equipment, and with respect to certain products within the time limits needed to sufficiently cook the product, e.g. q for firm products to obtain adequately softened texture.EereLofore, for aonieving commercial sterility of low acid foods in plastic containers, the desired thermal processing temperature range would 116 C ic9 C have been from about 240 FJto about 265 FA preferably to about 124 C 255 0F just as with metal containers. For most such products, 1160C processing at below 240 0F would take too long to achieve commercial sterility. Increasingly, from about 255 0F to 265 F the structural material tends to become so softened that distortion becomes increasingly problematical both in terms of distortion and crush resistance in a still retort and reformation becomes more difficult. In one test done vith green peas in an agitated cook 129 C Steritort at an 8 RPM reel speed at 2650F for 13 minutes all 8.1 x 11.1 cm the double seams of the 303 x 406 multi layer rigid plastic 260 F for 15 containers unfolded. At F, for 15 minutes, vith closely controlled overpressure cooling, 9 out of 125 containers panelled. In accordance with this invention, plastic containers can be thermally processed to achieve commercial sterility of the packaged foodstuff at temperatures below 240 F 116 C preferably from about 104 116µC 2200F to about 2400F. Of course, the temperature time employed will depend upon many factors as previously mentioned. Other things being equal, the time required for thermal processing plastic containers is longer than for metal containers because plastic does not conduct heat as well as metal. At the end of the thermal sterilization cycle, as in the case with plastic containers processed without an acidulant, any plastic wall distortion must reform.Reformation is done while the plastic of the bottom wall is at a reformable temperature, and can be achieved by causing the pressure outside of the container to exceed the pressure inside of the container, either by utilizing an added external pressure or by reducing the pressure inside the container. In accordance with this invention, as demonstrated by Example 1 and as illustrated 8 6Oth e left hand curves in Figures 2 7, since a CCT of only 205 F need be achieved for commercial sterilization of an acid or acidified foodstuff and since foodstuffs develop high internal pressures at 100 C 212 F or above, depending on the various factors involved, in many instances an overpressure cool may not need to be employed. For example, generally, there tends to be less need or desire for an overpressure cool for an agitated rotary cook than for a still cook.Less plastic container time in an agitation environment advantageously reduces chances of abrasion of the container wall surfaces. It has been found that as a general guideline for still cooking, depending of course on the factors involved, in any instances an overpressure cool may not be needed at temper below about 230 F, but, at temperatures above about 230 , it may be desirable to use some overpressure. 110 C 0.69 bar Above about 2300r, about 10 psi overpressure over the cook pressure inside the retort equipment has been found satisfactory.For example, should an overpressure cool be desired for r still retort in a situation in which there has been a cook temperature of ZIOOF 7tier ii60C 240 F with an internal retort pressure of lO.5,air or some inert O.C4 bar gas is introduced into the retort before cooling. About 10 psitover above the internal retort pressure has been found satisfactory for acceptable bottom wall reformation. After the bottom is reformed and the air pressure is removed by venting to ataospherlc, the water cooling process can be employed according to conventional practices, it being appreciated of course that with the lower cook temperatures hereunder, less cooling time Ir needed. From the above, it can be seen that, by reducing the thermal sterilisation temperature, need for a pressure cool and for staying within an allowable pressure cool psi time range say be eliminated while still obtaining acceptable reformation and good container aesthetics. As previously stated, an advantage provided by this invention is that the lower processing temperature mean less criticality as to filling conditions in terms of controlling the headspace to within an acceptable range because of the affect of headspace on internal gas pressures imposed on the container wall during the thermal sterilization cycle.Although it is not to be taken as directly analogous to foodstuffs, the broadening of the useful headspace range as cook temperature decreases can be somewhat illustrated by the fact that in the case of water hermetically sealed in 211 x 215 6.B x 7.4 cm 129 C multi layer rigid plastic containers, at 2650F the headspace must be kept between 8cc 10cc If less, there are rocker bottoms and 1270C if more, there is pannelling. At 260 Fr the range is between 6cc 116 C 10css at 255 F it is tween 4cc 10cc and at 240 F it is between Zce l4cc. It might be expected that the useful headspace range would be broadened at lower temperatures for water or for food. It is to be noted that in Example 1 squash, cooked at 104 C 2200 , acceptable configurations were obtained with 20cc headspace. It is thought that the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from the foregoing des ription, and it is apparent that various changes may be made in the steps of the methods and in the structures and materials described without departing from the ir .enton or sacrificinr its material advantages, the methods and the structures and materials hereinbefore described being merely preferred embodiments thereof.
