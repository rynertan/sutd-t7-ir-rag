## Description
CONCENTRATED LIQUID FABRIC SOFTENER COMPOSITION This invention pertains to concentrated liquid fabric softener compositions comprising a fabric substantive agent in conjunction with a fabric softening component. The fabric substantive agent is selected froi polyatines, alkylpyridinium salts and mixtures thereof. The fabric softening component can be represented by quaternary ammonium salts, alkylimidazolinium salts, fatty esters, ethers of fatty alcohols, fatty compounds which are interrupted by a sulfur or a nitrogen atom, and mixtures thereof.In preferred composition herein, the fabric softening component is represented by a mix ture of a quaternary ammonium salt and an additional fabric softening component selected from fatty esters, ethers of fatty alcohols and fatty compounds containing a long alkyl chain which are interrupted by a sulfur or nitrogen atom. The concentrated liquid softeners of this invention, in addition to easy pourability and water dispersability, provide a series of in portant advantages inclusive of consumer convenience in transport, storage and usage flexibility inasmuch as housewives are not any longer limited in selecting their degree of softeness by the capacity of the fabric softener dispenser in automatic washing machines. Another con venience aspect relates to the possibility now offered to the consumer to either utilize a concentrated product as such or to utilize it in a conventional concentration after predilution. Although it was well recognized that concentrated fabric softener compositions could provide convenience and utilization facilities to housewives, as of yet no technical solutions could be made available to overcome known deficiencies, especially, pourability and water di sper sability, inherent to conventional products containing more than about 10 to 12 active materials. Attempts have been undertaken to solve these problems through the use of electrolytes, inclusive of calcium chloride in e.g. levels up to 2000 pups. However, such remedies have not provided a satisfactory solution to the problems inasmuch as all that can be achieved is to possibly incorporate a few percent more actives into conventional liquid fabric softeners. However, the prior art does not provide a solution to formulate a commercially viable liquid rinsesoftener product containing active ingredient levels as claimed herein, or more broadly above about 15 , which do not have the physical appearanee and use shortcomings set forth above. It is a main object of this invention to provide concentrated fabric softener compositions having pourability and water dispersability properties which are substantially comparable to liquid softeners having conventional active concentration ranges i.e. from about 3 to about 10 by weight. It is a further object of this invention to provide a liquid concentrated softener composition the physical aspects of which ressemble conventional low active softeners and which is not subject to any phasestability or other deficiencies which can develop during prolonged storage. The above and other objects of this invention can now be obtained through the combined use of a fabric substantive agent and a fabricsoftening component in defined ranges as can be seen from the following description of the invention. SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION It has now been disebvered that concentrated liquid fabric softeners can be prepared which are capable of providing a series of convenience, usage and, generally, economical advantages.

Normally, at 600C, the subject softening agents exist in liquid form and therefore form true emulsions with an aqueous continuous phase.On cooling, the disperse phase may wholly or partially solidify so that the final composition exists as a dispersion which is not a true liquid liquid emulsion. It will be understood that the term dispersion means liquid liquid phase or solid liquid phase dispersions and emulsions. The following experimental evidence serves to illustrate the invention and to facilitate its understanding. EXAMPLE I A concentrated liquid fabric softener was prepared having the composition listed hereinafter. The glycerol monostearate was molten at 65 v. The ditallowdimethylammonitmchloride and the N tallowyl N,N , N tri 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3 propane diamine unneutralized were dispersed, under stirring, in the molten glycerolmonostearate to thus form the molten active material premix. The active material premix was thereafter dispersed under vigorous stirring in a waterseat having a temperature of about 600C. Prior to adding the premix, hydrochloric acid an minor ingredients were added to the waterseat to adJust the pH of the liquid softener composition to 4.5 measured at 200C . INGREDIENTS PARTS BY WEIGHTN tallowyl N,N ,N tri 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3 propanediamine d hydrochloride 12Ditallowyldimethylammoniumchloride 4Glycerolmonostearate 16Water and minor ingredients balance to 100 pH of composition as is at 22 C 5 The concentrated composition Cf this invention was easily pourable at ambient temperature after preparation and after a prolonged storage. This composition showed excellent phase stability and homogeneity after a 2 weeks storage. This composition also showed excellent fabric rinse softener properties either on adding to the rinse in its concentrated form thereby reducing the quantity to be added to thus take into account the higher level of actives, or after predilution to the usual liquid rinse softener concentration 5 to 8 . Substantially comparable fabric softener performance can be obtained from the composition of example I wherein N tallowyl N,N ,N tri 2 hydoxy ethyl l,3 propanediamine is replaced with a substantially equivalent amount of a polyanine selected from the group orN soybean alkyl l,3 propane diammonium sulfate N stearyl N,N di 2 hydroxyethyl N 3 hydroxypropyl 1,3 propenadiamine dlhydrofluorlde N cocoyl N,N,N ,N ,N pentamethyl 1,3 propane diammonium dichloride or dimethosulfate N oleyl N,N ,N tris 3 hydroxypropyl 1,3 propanediamine dihydrofluoride N stearyl N,N ,N tris 2 hydroxyethyl N,N dimethyl 1,3 propanediamonium dimethylsulfate N palmityl N,N ,N tris 3 hydroxypropyl 1.3 propanediamine dlhydrobromide N stearyloxypropyl N,N ,N tris 3 hydroxypropyl 1,3 propanediammonium diacetate N tallowyl N 3 aminopropyl 1,3 propanediamine trihydrochloride Noleyl N N ,Nr bis 2 hydroxyethyl 3 aminopropyl N ,N bis 2 hydroxy ethyl 1,3 diaminopropane trihydrofluoride.1 N hydrogenated tallowylaminopropyl pentahydropyridinium dihydrochloride and 1 N stearylaminopropyl 5 hydroxyethyl tetrahydropyridinium sulfate.
