# Improvements in or relating to the testing of structures by impact.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for testing structures by impact. The structure 4 is struck by an impactor 15 associated with a force transducer 13 the output of which is related to the force which the transducer experiences on impact and encompasses a frequency range including the lowest fre quencies typically approaching zero frequency which that force contains to any substantial degree. A test spectrum of the force including that full range of frequencies is produced by a Fourier transformer 21 in a form suitable for automatic comparison, and is then so compared at 22 with a reference spectrum typical of impact with a reference struc ture, and a signal is produced at 26 indicating fit or lack of fit between the test and reference spectra.
