# TRANSISTOR INVERTER DEVICE

## Abstract
A current mirror circuit M driven by the output of an inverter unit and first and second constant current sources are provided, and a first reference potential V1 applied to one input terminal of a comparator OP3 is formed by a first current i1 flowing through a first output current path of the current mirror circuit M at the time of the start of the inverter unit. At this time, an output potential V2 obtained from a time constant circuit 46 according to a second current i2 flowing a second output current path of the current mirror circuit M is compared in the comparator OP3 , and a resistor for restricting the inverter unit transistor base current is short circuited by the output of the compara tor OP3 when there occurs a relation V2 V1. As a result, a discharge lamp is held on by the output of the inverter unit. Toward the end of the life time of the discharge lamp, the output of an operational amplifier OP1 goes to a high level in response to an output from a detection winding, thus turning on a transistor Q2 to increase the current i1 in the first output current path of the current mirror circuit M so as to increase the second current i2 . Thus, the output level V3 of the time constant circuit 46 is increased up to V3, and the output of the inverter unit is intermittently stopped according to the output of the comparator OP2 .
