# TOOL RETENTION MECHANISM

## Abstract
A tool retention mechanism 10 is disclosed for clamping a tool holder knob 22. An elongate rod member 44 is supported lengthwise in a compartment 14 formed within the centre of a housing 12. A knob clamping assembly 54 is mounted on the outer end 48 of the rod member 44 and is constructed of an annular array of claw fingers 62 that are spring biased to urge them to move radially inward. A first piston 46 is slidably supported on the rod member 44 rearwardly of the claw fingers 62 and has a cylindrical collar portion 78 which slides over the claw fingers 62 to retain them in a knob clamping position. A second piston 50 is carried on the inner end 49 of the rod member 44 to define a closed chamber 110 with the inner closed end 34 of the compartment 14. A first set of Belleville washers 92 is mounted on the rod member 44 between the first 46 and second 50 pistons to bias the first piston 46 to the knob holding position, and a second set of Belleville washers 96 is concentrically disposed relative to the first set of Belleville washers 92 between an annular shoulder 98 formed in the compartment 14 and the second piston 50 to effect a large force on the rod member 44 in a direction towards the closed end 34 of the compartment 14. A fluid control means 100 is provided for selectively driving the second piston 50 a slight distance A to overcome the force exerted by the outer set of Belleville washers 96 and to drive the first piston 46 inwardly of the compartment 14 and move the cylindrical collar portion 78 away from the claw fingers 62 to free them to open.
