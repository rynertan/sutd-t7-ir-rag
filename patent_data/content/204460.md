# CARBONLESS SYSTEM INCLUDING SOLVENT ONLY MICROCAPSULES

## Abstract
A carbonless system having improved imaging charac teristics by the use of microcapsules containing only solvent is disclosed. The solvent only capsules are disposed within a carbonless system to enhance the resulting image without the use of additional dye precursor.
