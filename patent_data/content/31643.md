# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device of a charge storage type in which information can be erased by strong ultra violet light is disclosed. The device comprises at least one dummy bit line connected to dummy cells incorporated with main memory cells and at least one compensating circuit for detecting the potential of the dummy bit line. The compensating circuit supplies compensating currents to bit lines connected to the main memory cells, respon sive to the change of the potential of the dummy bit line.
