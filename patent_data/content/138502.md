## Description
VALVE ASSEMBLY This invention relates to a valve assembly and in particular to a valve assembly of the type in which one fluid carrying line can be alternately connected to each of two other lines. More specifically, the invention is concerned with a valve assembly for use in the dairy industry for connecting a milk line leading from the milk claw and teat cup liners or inflations alternately to a vacuum line, for receiving milk, and to a cleaning line, for receiving wback flushing fluids for cleaning the milk claw and the milk line. Infection of the teats and udder of a cow, generally known as mastitis, can be transmitted among the cows in a herd through the teat inflations or liners of the teat cups, the normal practice being to use the same liner on several cows during one milking session. One approach to controlling the spread of mastitis has been to wash the inflations manually with a disinfectant solution after every milking. Since it is not feasible to prepare fresh solution for each wash, the solution becomes contaminated and the whole effort becomes fruitless or counter productive. Semi automatic cleaning of the inflations with plain water has been tried also in the past. In recent year attempts have been made to systematically clean the inflations between milking by backflushing or running a clean solution backwardly through the inflations. In general, the backflushing technique includes a pre rinse cycle for the removal of residual silk from the silk tube and claw cluster, a sanitizing cycle for the removal or elimination of the mastitis causing bacteria from the milk tube and claw cluster, a post rinse cycle for the removal of the sanitizing solution from the milk tube and claw cluster, and an air dry cycle for removal of the rinse water, and drying. In most backflush systems the length of each of these cycles is adjustable. In general, backflush systems have been successful in reducing the, spread of mastitis and improving udder health. However, problems still remain. Most backflush systems use a slide valve for disconnecting the claw cluster from the milk line and connecting it to the back flush line which furnishes the water, air and sanitizing solution. This valve is the heart of the system because it must be capable of disconnecting the sanitizing solution line without contaminating the milk with sanitizing chemicals. The design standard for backflush valves is stated in FDA Transmittal 79 13 M A 65, dated 11 15 79 as follows An intervening break to the atmosphere shall be provided between the water and or chemical solutions and the product and or product contact surfaces at all times. The slide valves currently used in backflushing systems have not been completely successful in meeting this standard because they become plugged by milk or cheese bulldup, and can make the intended intervening break non existent. Milk or cheese build up in conventional valves leads to vacuum leakage and leakage of sanitizing solution from the solution line to the aflklfne. Some of the specific problems associated with current slide valves are a. The springs used for maintaining tension between sliding parts of the valve tend to get loose or are not properly tightened, with resulting leakage. b. The constant sliding of the valve promotes wear and looseness of the sliding parts, leading to leakage. The problem is aggravated by sand or other abrasive particles often present in farm environments. c. Mechanical or electrical failure of the components associated with the sanitizing solution line leads to mixing of the sanitizing solution with the milk in the milkline. Sliding valves are not generally designed to be fail safe. d. Slide valves are difficult to clean. In most cases they must be disassembled and cleaned manually using a hand brush. 8uch practice is not compatible wit r modern farm automation and the nearly contlnuDus use of dairy equipment for 20 to 22 houri of continuous milking. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a valve assembly in which a primary conduit can be alternately connected to two secondary conduits, the relative movement between said primary conduit on the one hand and the two secondary conduits on the oher being arcuate in nature and through an open space. Because the movement is arcuate the disconnection and connecticn of the primary conduit with the secondary conduits is axia. of the conduits, avoiding shear minimizing abrasion and wear and avoiding the smearing of the fluids being conveyed cr adjacent surfaces. Because the movement is through an oper space, there is little or no chance of transmission of fluid from one secondary conduit to the other. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a view in side elevation of a preferred form of valve assembly according to the invention. Figure 2 is a view in front elevation, taken from the left in Fig. 1. Figure 3 is a plan view of the assembly of Fig. 1.

Figure 6 is detailed view of the tube and nipple feeding into the valve of Fig. 1. Figure 7 is a view in side elevation of an alternative embodiment of a valve assembly according to the invention. Figure 8 is a front elevational view of the device of Figure 7 taken from the left of Fig. 7 showing the relationship between the several linkages. Figure 9 is a plan view of the device of Fig. 7. Figure 10 is a view in front elevation showing the connection between the drive link and the hose ring in the device of Figure 7. Referring first to Figures 1 6, a valve assembly according to the invention is positioned in a box or container 10 which will noraally but not necessarily be mounted with its long axis vertical as shown in Figure 1. A hinged cover S is provided for the box 10. On one side of the container are provided apertures 11, 12 for two nipples 13 and 14 to which are attached tubes 13A and 14A. The nipples may be fixed to the wall of the box, as by welding. On the opposite wall of the box is provided an elongated aperture 15 to accommodate a third tube 16A to which is connected a nipple 16. The tube 16A is not fixed to the wall of the box 10 but is free to love up and down in aperture 15. Inside the box is located a linkage system indicated generally ar 9. This system comprises two base links 17 and 18 which are fixed to the wall of the box 10 by screws 19, 20. Pivotally connected at one end to the base links 17, 18 are connecting links 21, 22. Each of the connecting links 21, 22 is connected at its other end to an end of a main link or beam 23. The relationship and dimensions of the links can be seen more clearly from Figure 2. As will appear from that figure, the beam 23 is fairly broad nod has a number of holes or apertures. One of these, 24, accossodates the nipple 16. Ai shown in Figure 6, this nipple has a head 25, and an extended section 26 with a groove 27. Tube 16A fits into section 26.In assembly the upper section 26 is fitted through the aperture 24 in the beam 23 and a retaining ring 29 is snapped into groove 27. A washer 30 is then slid over the nipple 16 to rest on retaining ring 29. A helical coil spring 31 is placed over the washer 30 and is retained by a channel member 32 which is fixed to beam 23 by screws 33, 34. Also fixed to the beam 23 is a hose support bracket 8 which may be used to carry a hose not shown attached to tube 16. A slide plate 47 is provided to close aperture 15.It is held against the wall 48 of the container 10 by a bow spring 49 which bears against the plate 47 and channel member 32. Roles 49A and 49B are provided in plate 47 to accomodate tube l6A and the hose support bracket 8. The beam 23 further carries a seal or cover 35.Cover 35 has a shaft 36 which passes through a counter sunk aperture 37 in beam 23 and is held loosely therein by a retaining ring .38 which has a rnap fit on shaft 36. Cover 35 is urged downwardly by a spring 39 which is inserted between the beam 23 and the cover 35. The linkage 9 is operated by means of a pneumatic cylinder 40. Cylinder 40 is mounted in a bracket 41 fastened to the top of box 10 by bolts 42. Cylinder 40 is positioned behind the linkage assembly 9, as the device is shown inFigure 1. It acts on the linkage assembly through a piston 43 whose end is threaded and connected to the short arm 45a of an L shaped element 45 Figure 5 whose long arm 45b is attached to connecting link 22 by screw 46. In operation, in a milk processing context, the tube 16 is connected to the milk line not shown leading to the milk claw and the inflations. not shown The tube 13A is connected to the vacuum line not shown for receiving the milk from the milk line attached to tube 16A. The tube 14A is attached to the backflush line not shown . In the position shown in Figure 1 milk will flow from the cow being milked through the tube 16A, into the nipple 13, tube 13A and thence to a collection device for further processing. After the particular animal has been milked, through a series of signals whose generation is not pertinent to the invention and not shown in the drawing, compressed air will be admitted to the upper end of cylinder 40 through tube 7, driving piston 43 downward in Figure 1.Piston 43 will rotate connecting link 22 downwardly in an arcuate movement. At the same time nipple 16 and tube 16A will be separated from nipple 13 and moved in an arcuate path to connect with nipple 14, being forced down against nipple 14 by the pressure of spring 31. This movement is accompanied by sliding of the plate 47 downwardly with the tube 16A. At the same time the vacuum line and nipple 13 will be sealed by cover 35 under action of spring 39. With the nipples 14 and 16 connected, backwashing fluids can be sent through tube 14A nipple 14, nipple 16 and tube 16A to the milk claw and inflations, cleaning them and finally drying them. When the backwash cycle is coapleted, air may be admitted to the lower end of cylinder 40, through tube 6, forcing the piston upwardly and moving nipple 16 back to connect with nipple 13 as shown in Figure 1. Figs. 7 to 10 show an alternative form of the invention. Again, the valve assembly is mounted in a rectangular container or box 50 whose longitudinal axis is generally vertical. A partition 51 which is about half the depth of the box 50 is attached to the bottom and sides of the box as by welding. This partition 51 has two apertures in which are mounted nipples 52, 53. Two conduits 54, 55,are led through apertures 56, 57 in the wall of the box 50 and secured to the nipples 52, 53 by hose clamps 58, 59. The bottom of box 50 is only partially closed by a channel member 60, which is bolted to the sides of the box at 60a and 60b, leaving a space 61 extending across the width of the box. In this space is inserted a flexible conduit 62 to which is fixed a nipple 63. The conduit 62 carries at a point near its end, a pivot ring 64 Fig. 6 . As shown inFig. 10, the pivot ring 64 is supported between two pivot links 65, 66 by pins 67, 68. The pivot links are separated at their other end by a spacer pin 69. Spacer pin 69 is pivotally mounted in the wall of the box and in a second channel member 84 which is secured to box 50 by bolts 85, 86. The pin 67 is pivotally attached to one end of a driving link 71 which, at the other end, is pivotally attached by a pin 72 to the end of one leg 73 of an L shaped link 74. The other leg 75 of link 74 is pivotally attached to the channel member 84 by pin 76. At the angle of L shaped member 74, it is pivotally mounted in a yoke 79 which is threaded on the end of a piston 80 which is operated by pneumatic cylinder 81 mounted in the box 50 on bracket 82. Assuming the device is to be used in a milking operation, the conduit 54 is a vacuum line for receiving milk, and the conduit 55 is a backflushing line. The conduit 62 is the milk line fro the milk claw and inflations. In the position shown in Figs. 7 to 10, the conduit 62 is connected to the vacuum line 54. After washing is completed air will be admitted, through a valve not shown, and through conduit 87, to the upper end of the cylinder 81.Piston 80 will move down, causing L shaped link 74 to rotate about the pin 76 thus swinging drive link 71 and pivot links 65, 66 about spacer pin 69. The conduit 62, being attached to the links 65, 66 by pivot ring 64, swings downwardly away from nipple 53 in an arcuate path unitl its nippl c 63 closes with nipple 62, thus connecting the milk claw and rhe inflations with the back washing system. After bick washing is completed, air may be furnished to conduit 88 of the pneumatic cylinder 81, forcing piston 80 upwardly and swinging conduit 62 and nipple 63 back into engacement with the nipple 53 and the vacuum system. Although the invention has been deserted in connection with a milking system it is clearly a , plicable to various other fluid systems where a positive dis onnect of fluid transport lines is desired. Similarly, although the system is shown as pneumatically operated, hydraulic or electrical driving means could be employed.
