# Lighting apparatus.

## Abstract
A lighting apparatus comprises a housing having an opening, a light source received in the housing and a light transmitting cover 12 fixed at the opening of the housing and through which light rays are projected from the light source. The light transmitting cover 12 includes a plate made of light transmitting material and having a first surface and a second surface. Segment lens elements of the same size are arranged on the first and second surface of the plate and formed integrally with the plate. The segment lens elements on the first surface 33A are positioned in face to face relation with the segment lens elements arranged on the second surface 33B , thus forming a segment lens 31 . The segment lens elements have a common optical axis 32 and convex surfaces 33A, 33B , respectively. The focal lengths defined by these convex surfaces 33A, 33B are equal. The focal point of one of the segment lens elements lies on the convex surface of the other segment lens element, and that of the other segment lens element lies on the convex surface of the other segment lens element.
