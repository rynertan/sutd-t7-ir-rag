# A scale of flat construction.

## Abstract
The scale is of limited height and utilizes Z shaped flexures between the load frame and support frame. The scale can be placed in a hospital bed for weighing bedridden patients or for monitoring weight variations in bedridden patients. A cart is provided for transporting the scale from place to place and includes an inclined ramp from which the scale may be readily moved onto a bed.
