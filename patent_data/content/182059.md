# THERMALLY TRANSFERABLE INK COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A thermally transferable ink composition comprising a from 50 to 95 by weight of a thermoplastic polymer selected from polyvinyl chloride, copolymers thereof, and blends thereof b from 50 to 5 by weight of a flexibilizer for said thermoplastic polymer that is compatible with said thermo plastic polymer and c up to about 40 by weight of a colourant the com position having a 20 elongation temperature of less than about 85 C and an elongation at break of at least about 15 and being thermally transferable from a carrier to a recep tor at a temperature in the range of 75 to 110 C. The inks are suitable for use in the preparation of sign faces.
