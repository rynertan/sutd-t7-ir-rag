# SILICA GEL LINKED TO A PHTHALOCYANINE COMPOUND AND A METHOD FOR TREATING POLYCYCLIC ORGANIC SUBSTANCES THEREWITH

## Abstract
Silica gel is treated with a reactive phthalocyanine com pound to form the blue silica gel, which has a phthalocyanine skeleton linked through an organic group. Typically, a phthalo cyanine reactive dye is used for the reaction with silica gel at its hydroxyl or other reactive site. The blue silica gel easily ad sorbs and desorbs the polycyclic organic substances in a solu tion. The blue silica gel can be used for the separation or re moval of the mutagenic substances from the environment, foodstuffs, etc.
