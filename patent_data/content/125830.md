# Scrap tire cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting scrap tires and other waste pro ducts is disclosed. The apparatus includes a frame having a cylindrical anvil roll 10 rotatably mounted therein. A blade roll 30 is also mounted in the frame for rotation about an axis parallel to the rotational axis of the anvil roll, and a plurality of axially spaced roller blades 40 of predetermined diameter are fixed to the blade roll and rotatable therewith. The blade roll is also provided with a pair of axially spaced thrust wheels 56, 58 , with the thrust wheels being positioned outboard of the blades and being equal to or slightly greater in diameter than the predetermined diameter of the blades. Driving means 160 are provided in the apparatus for rotating the anvil roll and the blade roll in opposite directions in such a manner that scrap tires fed to the rolls will be drawn inwardly into the nip formed between the rolls and will be cut between the blades and the anvil. Biasing means 80, 82 are also provided for forcing the outer peripheries of the thrust wheels and the anvil roll into hard contact with one another thereby to maintain the spacing between the cutting surfaces of the blades and the outer surface of the anvil fixed, notwithstand ing the separating forces caused by the movement of a tire between such surfaces.
