# Turbine stator assembly.

## Abstract
The stator vanes 12, 14 of an axial flow gas turbine are supported by spaced flanges 4, 6 in the surrounding turbine case one of which flanges 6 supports the upstream end of the outer shroud 10 of the vane 12 radially and also serves to position the blade tip seal segments and the surrounding air seal ring 40 . The other flange 4 engages lugs 8 from the vane shroud 10 and also supports clips for the clip seal segments and the upstream edge of the air seal ring 40 .
