# MOS switch circuit.

## Abstract
The invention provides an inverting amplifier having a CMOS inverter 34 and a MOSFET 36 , the latter being connected to an input output path of the CMOS inverter 34 to autozero the CMOS inverter 34 to its toggle point upon being turned on. An output signal from a CMOS inverter 40, 42 which has a short circuited input output path is supplied to the back gate of the MOSFET 36 . Even if a gate threshold voltage of the MOSFET 36 varies, its ON resistance is kept substantially constant.
