# Herbicidal sulfonamides.

## Abstract
Sulfonamide derivatives of the formula CHEM wherein Q is an optionaily substituted benzothiazole, benzisothiazole, benzoxazole or benzisoxazole group W1 is O or S, R7 is H or CH3 and A is a mono or bicyclic heterocyclic group, e.g. pyrimidinyl or triazinyl, and their agriculturally suitable salts, exhiblt herbicidal activity. Some also show a plant growth regulant effect. The compounds may be formulated for agricultural use in conventional manner. They may be made e.g. by reacting an appropriate sulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate QSO2NCW1 with an appropriate heterocylic amine HNR7A.
