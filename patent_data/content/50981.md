# STEROID CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR TOPICAL USES

## Abstract
A composition which can be used for nightly administra tion to a patient requiring treatment of topical disorders of the rectum and distal colon, comprises, per discrete unit, from 0.1 to 2 mg of a topically active steroid drug such as beclometha sone dispropionate. The unit may be in the form of a 50 to 150 ml aqueous enema. The low dosage avoids systemic side effects.
