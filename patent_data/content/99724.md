# DEPOSITION OF COATINGS UPON SUBSTRATES UTILISING A HIGH PRESSURE, NON LOCAL THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM ARC PLASMA

## Abstract
A process for the coating of a substrate characterised in that it comprises generating a non LTE arc plasma at a pressure of greater than 0.1 atmospheres introducing a coating material into the arc plasma and positioning a substrate proximate to the arc plasma, activated species of the coating material formed by the arc plasma contacting the substrate to form a coating is disclosed. In certain embodiments of the present process, a semicon ductor or a photovoltaic semiconductor may be produced. The present invention offers advantages over the prior art.
