Examples of the dosage form are, for instance, tablets, capsules, granules, syrups, suppositories, ointments and the like.Carrier used in the dosage form of the antibacterial agents of the present invention is usually inactive pharmaceutical carrier of an organic or an inorganic solid or liquid suitable for an oral, rectal, topical or parenteral administration such as, for instance, crystalline cellulose, gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium sterate, talc, plant or animal fat or oil, gum or polyalkylene glycol. A ratio of the antibacterial agent of the present invention to the carrier in the dosage form can vary from 0.2 to 100 by weight. The antibacterial agent of the present invention can contain another pharmaceutical component such as another antibacterial agent compatible with the antibacterial agent of the present invention. In this case, however, the antibacterial agent of the present invention is not necessarily the chief ingredient of the dosage form. The antibacterial agent of the present invention is administered with such a dose that the desired activity is achieved without any side effect.Though the actual dose should be determined according to the judgment of the doctor, around 10 mg to around 10 g, preferably around 20 mg to around 5 g per day of the antibacterial agent of the present invention is usually administered for adults. The antibacterial agent of the present invention can be administered in a pharmaceutical dosage unit containing 1 mg to 5 g, preferably 3 mg to 1 g of an effective component. The present invention is more particularly described and explained by the following Examples.However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to such Examples and various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In the following Examples, infrared absorption spectrum was measured according to the potassium bromide tablet method. Thin layer chromatography was carried out using Silica gel 60 F254 E. Merck Co. and the thin layer chromatography plate 20 cm x 20 cm . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum was measured using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and deuterated chloroform solution. Measurement of the visible absorption spectrum was conducted in a solvent of methanol. Example 1 Synthesis of derivative No. 1 A solution of 0.2 g of benzoxazinorifamycin, which was prepared according to the method described inHelv. Chim. Acta, 56, p 2369 1973 , in 7.0 ml of methanol was mixed with a solution of 0.2 g of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 0.28 ml of triethylamine.The mixture was stirred for 18 hours at room temperature.Ethyl acetate was added to the reaction mixture and the resultant was washed twice with a saturated NaCQ solution, followed by distillation of a solvent under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silca gel column chromatography adsorbent Wakogel C 200, eluent chloroform acetone 90 10 to give a fraction containing the desired derivative. A solvent of the fraction was distilled away under reduced pressure and the residue was subjected to silica gel columnchromatography as above, followed by work up of the resultant to give 53 mg of a pure derivative No. 1.
