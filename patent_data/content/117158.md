## Description
DISC DRIVE CARRIAGE SLIDE ASSEMBLY The present invention relates to floppy disc drives, and more particularly, to a floppy disc drive which incorporates a novel carriage slide assembly for providing relative movement between a carriage and a fixed member associated with the disc drive mainframe. Floppy disc information storage systems currently available typically utilize a thin pliant disc element contained within a cover jacket with low cost accessing, transducing and control systems. The transducer structure comprises a single or double channel head mounted in a transducer, the transducer itself being mounted in a carriage that is accessed to different circumferential tracks on the floppy disc by a inicroprocessor based control system. The carriageA ead assembly is mounted on a pair I of spaced steel rods attached to the mainframe to allow the carriage to slide in a linear direction, the carriage being incrementally positioned by a metal band actuator or a lead screw . The bearing surface, typically made of plastic, is provided by the carriage itself, the steel rods directly COI tacting the inner surface of the portion of the carriage through which it passes. Normally a tight fit is desired between the two contacting surfaces to provide for accurate accessing of the desired circumferential track. However, the tight fit increases the friction between the two contacting parts, thus reducing access speeds and causing hysteresis effects.The hysteresis effect causes the head to be accessed to two different track positions although the same access signal is applied, at different time periods, to a stepper motor.The difference between the two positions is known as the spread If one attempts to minimize the spread by loosening the coupling between the two surfaces, carriage wobble and vibration, witn the associated positioning inaccuracies and noise, are likely to result The two carriage rods, it should be noted, must be spaced apart a predetermined distance to minimize the carriage tilt movement, thus limiting the amount of space left on the mainframe. The disc drive designer is thus constrained to a certain degree from reducing the size of the drive system, at least with respect to the principle plane dimensions, by the rod spacing. The orientation of the disc element determines the orientation of the carriage element and thus the orientation of the carriage rods. This factor also limits the flexibility of system design both from the standpoint of component place anent and system size reduction. What is desired, therefore, is to provide an improved disc drive system slide assembly wherein the carriage is movable in a manner wherein the friction between the carriage and the fixed support member is substantially reduced while maintaining the necessary tight coupling for accurate positioning capabilities. It is also desired that the slide assembly have the capability of being mounted to the carriage in various orientations, thus allowing further reductions in system size and for optimization of the disc drive manufacturing and assembling operations. The present invention provides an improved disc drive carriage slide assembly which allows a transducer head supporting carriage to move relative to a disc drive mainframe.The carriage slide assembly provides a first, or movable, member, coupled to the carriage, and a second, or fixed member, mounted to the mainframe. A plurality of precision roller bearings are retained within the slide assembly between the movable and fixed members in a manner to allow the movable member to move relative to the fixed member in a linear manner while maintaining a tight coupling therebetween. The slide assembly is designed such that its orientation with respect to the carriage element can be varied, orientation selection being determined by space and manufacturing considerations.The fixed member of the slide assembly may be formed as part of the disc drive mainframe to reduce system costs. The carriage slide assembly as described substantially reduces the friction encountered as the carriage is accessed to a selected circumferential track on the disc while maintaining the tight coupling required for accurate positioning.Since the slide interaction surfaces are within a limited, closely spaced area, the width of the carriage can be reduced.Further the assembly can be located at various orientations with respect to the carriage. Both features allow the disc drive to be reduced in size since component placement in the disc drive mainframe can be more compact. Further, locating the fixed portion of the assembly in the mainframe substantially reduces the cost of disc drive manufacturing since the fixed portion is produced as an integral part of the mainframe, the cost of manufacture that would otherwise have ben necessary to produce the separate component thus being eliminated.

Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, a typical prior art disc drive carriage slide assembly 8 is illustrated.Manufacturers of disc drive systems incorporating illustrated slide assembly 8 include, for example, Shugart Associates, Sunnyvale, California Tandon Corporation, Chatsworth, California and Mitsuishi Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. Slide assembly S includes a carriage 10 and a transducer assembly 12 mounted thereon. A magnetic head 14 is mounted to the transducer assembly 12 as illustrated. Although only one magnetic head 14 is illustrated, a second magnetic head oppositely disposed to head 14 can be provided to increase the storage capacity of the system. Carriage 10 includes portion 16 which is coupled to a metal band actuator system 18 which comprises bias spring 20, cable 22 affixed to carriage portion 16 and cable drum 24.The construction and operation of metal band actuator systems have been widely described in the prior art and thus will not be set forth in detail herein. Two parallel steel rods 26 and 28 are provided to allow the carriage 10 to move in a linear manner in the direction of arrows 27. As illustrated, the length of rod 26 is less than the length of rod 28, although equal length rods could also be utilized. Carriage 10, preferably made of plastic material, has an inner surface 30 which provides a bearing surface between the carriage 10 and and rod 26. The inner surfaces of support members 32r 34, 36, and 38 of slide portion 16 also provide bearing surfaces between carriage 10 and rod 28.Although not illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the rods 26 and 28 are supported above the surface of the system mainframe 40 of disc drive system 8 to allow for linear movement of the carriage 10 without interference. It should be noted that the rods 26 and 28 are required to be spaced apart a predetermined distance in order to eliminate a tilt movement which would occur otherwise.The required distance between rods 26 and 28 necessarily limits the space available on the surface of m.ainframe 40 for placement of other components which comprise the disc drive system In operation, a controller not shown generates appropriate control signals such that the head 14 is accessed to a preselected circumferential track on the disc 42. In particular, the signal drives a stepper motor not shown which is directly coupled to drum 24. Rotation of the drum causes cable 22 wrapped thereon to position carriage 10 via portion 16 such that head 14 is properly accessed, carriage 10 sliding on rods 26 and 28. Figure 3 shows a plan view of the carriage slide assembly of the present invention. In order to place the present invention in better perspective, definitions of some of the terms utilized hereinafter are now set forth In particular, the term mainframe as utilized hereinafter is intended to signify the main casting made to house the disc drive system components and is referred to by reference numeral 50. The various components which make up the disc drive system of the present invention are generally secured to the mainframe 50 directly or through various intermediate components.The phrase principal plane dimensions as used hereinafter refers to the dimensions in the , Y direction as shown in Figure 3 and, as will be set forth hereinafter, is utilized in the context of the present invention to illustrate that the disclosed slide assembly allows the principal plane dimensions to be reduced, thus reducing the overall size of the disc drive system. It should be noted that the same reference numerals utilized in each of the figures identify identical components. The disc drive system of the present invention is similar to the prior art device shown in Figures 1 and 2 with the exception that the carriage slide assembly 8, which in essence comprises two separate, spaced apart interaction surfaces rods 26 and 28 is replaced by a carriage slide assembly 52 having slide interaction surfaces within a limited, closely spaced area. The carriage slide assembly 52, discussed in more detail hereinafter with reference to Figures 6 10, comprises a fixed member 54 and a movable member 56. A carriage 57 supports transducer assembly 58 having a magnetic head 59 mounted therein. As with the prior art disc drive systems, a second magnetic head positioned adjacent the opposite disc surface can be provided. A portion 60 of carriage 57 is coupled on side 61 to the movable member 56 and on side 63 to a metal band actuator 62 via fastener 64.Cable 62 is formed about pulleys 66 and 68, pulley 66 being maintaincd in tension by spring 70 and pulley 68 being driven by the shaft 72 of a stepper motor not shown . A member 74 for centering the floppy disc when it is inserted into the disc drive system is provided as illustrated hcn the disc is inserted into the. disc drive in the direction of arrow 76, member 74 pivots about rod 78 in order to center and hold the disc in proper position. Head 58, normally positioned away from the plane of the disc, is pivoted into contact with the disc surface at the same time the centering member 74 is rotated into position.Finger, or control tab 75, is engageable by a solenoid operated element not shown or by an element related to the clutch assembly to permit automatic pivoting of transducer 58 from the disc or to release the transducer 58 to permit engagement or landing of the magnetic head 59 on the flexible disc. Engagement of the finger 75 also causes the centering member 74 to be similarly engaged via the coupling between finger 75 and the finger support arm 83. In operation, after the flexible disc is inserted into the disc drive system, a controller applies appropriate control signals to the stepper motor, rotating shaft 72 a predetermined amount such that band 72 drives the carriage 57 an appropriate distance. In particular, head 58 is accessed to a preselected circumferential track by carriage 57 sliding in the linear direction arrows 791 by virtue of the novel carriage slide assembly 52 of the present invention Figure 4 is a bottom view of Figure 3 and shows fiyed member 54 of the carriage slide assembly 52 affixed to a support member 82 extending from mainframe 50 via screws 84 and 86. Also shown in the figure is disc drive motor 88 and stepper motor 90. Figure 5 illustrates an alternate carriage drive mechanism which can be utilized in the present inventionIn particular, a lead screw 92 has a movable nut 94 forme2 thereon, nut 94 being joined to carriage portion 60 as illustrated. The direct drive motor 96 is coupled to lead screw 92. Energization of motor 96 rotates lead screw 92, causing nut 94 to move along the lead screw 92 and thus moving the carriage 57 to a predetermined position such that head 59 accesses the desired clrcumercntial track on the disc. Figure 6 is a partial sectional view along line 6 6 of Figure 5 and shows the external end details of the novel carrage slide assembly 52 of the present invention. Side 61 of carriage portion 60 is secured to movable member 56 as shown, member 56 being slideably coupled to fixed member 54 by a precision roller bearing arrangement shown in more detail in Figures 7 10. A carriage slide end cap 100 for limiting the movement of member 56 is affixed to one end of the member 56 via screw 102. Two slide end plates 104 only one shown in Figure 6 affixed to member 54 at each end via end plate retaining screws 106 and 108, maintain the roller bearing guide rods 110 Figure 8 associated with fixed member 54 in place. As illustrated, member 54 is affixed to member 82 extending from the surface of mainframe 50 via screws 84 and 112. The details of the novel carriage slide assembly 52 of the present invention are now described with reference to Figures 7 10. Fixed member 54 is shaped C shape in the embodiment illustrated such that a channel 111 is provided to allow movable portion 56 to slide therein. Channels, or passageways, 114 and 116 are formed along the length of member 54 and channels, or passageways, 118 and 120 are formed along the length of movable member 56. Channels 114 and 116 are spaced from and coextensive with channels 118 and 120, respectively. A plurality of roller, or ball, bearings 122 are arranged between channels 114 and 118 and a plurality of roller bearings 124 are arranged between the channels 116 and 124 as shown. It should be noted that although only seven roller bearings are illustrated in each arrangement, either more or less can be utilized.The roller bearings are spaced from one another, in each arrangement, and held in position by an apertured spacer member 126. Two guide rods 110 are positioned in each of the channels 114 and 116, guide rods 110 being fixed in position by end plates 104. Two guide rods 128 are positioned in each of the channels Ilb and 120 and secured along the surface of movable member 56 between plate 100 and lip 133 of member 56. A plurality of bearing adjustment screws 130 are provided to allow a movable pressure plate 132 positioned within channel 116 to be adjusted whereby the overall friction level between the movable member 54 and fixed member 56 can be adjusted as desired. As set forth hereinabove, rods 110 are fixed to the fixed member 54 via end plates 104 whereas rods 128 are fixed to the movable member 56 by end plate 100 in a manner such that guide rods 128 move with the movable member 56.Guide rods 128 tbus slide over the roller bearings 110 and 124 to provide reduced frictional coupling between fixed member 54 and movable member 56 as the carriage 57, and thus head 58, is accessed to its desired position Figure 10 shows more detail of the circled portion of the carriage slide assembly of Figure 8. The bearing ad justment screws 130 act upon the pressure plate 132 in a manner such that roller bearings 124 can be moved either closer or further away from the movable member 56, thereby adjusting the frictional contact between the fixed member 54 and movable member 56. Figure 11 is identical to the disc drive system shown in Figure 3 with the exception that the novel carriage slide assembly 52 of the present invention is shown in a dif ferent orientation. In particular, carriage slide assembly 52 been positioned on the opposite side of carriage portion 60 as viewed in the figure, on the bottom of the carriage portion 6t in contrast to its position shown in Figure 3 as viewed in the figure on the top of carriage portion 60 . Figure 12 shows a third orientation of the carriage slide assembly 52 of the present invention wherein the assembly is positioned with the fixed member 54 above the carriage portion 60 Figure 13 shows a fourth orientation of the car riage slide asembly 52 with the fixed member 54 positioned below the carriage portion 60. Although only four orientations have been disclosed, other orientations can be provided.The possible variations in orientation of the carriage slide assembly 52 provides a system design with great flexibility in designing the overall disc drive system such that the weight and size can be reduced and in placelaxent of system components in a more compact manner. Further, the flexibility of carriage slide assembly orientation also can adapt itself to minimize manufacturing and assembly costs associated with the disc drive system itself. Referring now to Figure f, an alternate embodiment of carriage slide assembly 52 is illustrated. In particular, the necessity of using guide rods is eliminated since the bearing surface 10 of the roller bearing is machined as a series of recesses, or seats, into the surface of fixed member 54 along its length Similarly, coextensive recesses, or seats, 142 are machined into the surface of movable part 56 along its length. The roller bearings are positioned for rotation within tlle seats 140 and 142 as illustrated and thus reduce the friction between the movable and fixed members when the drive force is nppljed to carriage 57. Figure 15 is a further embodiment wherein the necessity of using a separate component for fixed member 54 is eliminated, the fizzed member now being an integral part of mainframe 50. As shown, the roller bearing seats 160 are machined into the surface of mainframe casting, saving processing time and reducing overall manufacturing costs. In this embodiment, the corresponding seats 162 for the roller bearings are machined into the movable member 56 in a manner similar to that described with reference to Figure 14. Figures 16 and 17 are set forth to illustrate the hysteresis effect described hereinabove. Ideally, the carriage element always returns to the same position if the same positioning control signal is applied to the motor driving the carriage. Figure 16 includes a reference position 180 to which it is desired to move the carriage in either the direction indicated by reference arrow 182 or the direction indicated by reference arrow 184. Assuming ideal conditions, the carriage would be driven to the reference location 180 each time the proper signal is applied. However, Figure 17 illustrates the actual situation that occurs in prior art disc drive systems. Reference arrow 186 illustrates the initial positioning of the carriage to reference position 180 reference position 187 illustrates, after a period of time, the position taken by the carriage when moved in the direction of arrow 188 for the same signal which moved the carriage to reference position 180 and reference position 189 illustrates, after a period of time, the position of the carriage when moved in the direction of arrow 190. The distance a, or spread, is caused by the hysteresis effect. The present invention by virtue of using the roller bearing carriage slide assembly described hereinabove substantially reduces the spread effect caused by hysteresis. The versatility of the novel carriage slide assembly of the present invention provides many advantages over the prior art carriage slide assemblies. In particular, since the slide surface intersection surfaces are in a limited area, space considerations dictated by the prior art use of two spaced apart steel rods is eliminated, thus allowing reduction in the principal plan dimensions since there is more area available on the mainframe surface to position the remaining components in a more economical and compact manner. The primary advantage of the present invention is that the roller bearings substantially reduce the friction between the bearing services of the fixed and movable members, substantially eliminating the aforementioned hysteresis effect and thus allowing more accurate positioning of the head to the selected circumferential track.Since the carriage slide assembly can be positioned with respect to the mainframe in any one of a plurality of orientations, the system designer has great flexibility in positioning the slide assembly to provide the most compact, efficient, and cost effective disc drive system. The present invention also provides for the fixed member of the carriage slide assembly to be part of the mainframe, substantially reducing the cost of system design. In contradistinction thereto, the prior art carriage slide assembly guide rods cannot be made part of the mainframe, thus limiting the amount of cost savings svllich can be attained. While the invention has been described with reference to its preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true spirit an scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teaching of the invention without departing from its essential teachings.
