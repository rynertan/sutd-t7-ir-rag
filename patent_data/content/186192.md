# Control switch for motor driven remote control mirror in vehicle.

## Abstract
A control switch for a motor driven remote control mirror device in a vehicle has a switching control circuit for connecting motors for driving a mirror to be tilted to a DC power source. The control circuit has first and second stationary contact to be connected with one terminals of the motors for tilting the mirror around horizontal and vertical axes, and a third stationary contact to be commonly connected to the other terminals of the motors, the contacts are selectively connected with the negative and positive polarities of a power source by bridge members disposed corresponding to the contacts. The bridge members ordinari ly connect the contacts to the negative polarity of the power source, and connect, when elastically deformed, to the positive polarity. A push plate is elastically supported by the bridge members, has a leg for operating the bridge members on the back surface, and the relative bridge member is operated by pressing the direction indication unit of the push plate.
