## Description
A Gatherable Laminated StructureIncluding An Apertured Elastic Member Background of the InventionRecent years have seen an increased dcrzand for in expensive apparel and the developmellt of new and inexpensive components of construction and methods of construction of articles of apparel. In certain instances, there is a demand for apparel that is very inexpensive, and indeed, disposable. New elastomeric materials and methods of incorporating them into portions of a garment have been developed to meet the desire to fit these types of garments to a human form. For example, U.S.Patent No. 3,639,917 discloses the use of a strip of a heat recoverable elastomeric material to gather the cuff of a disposable hospital gowm. Disposable diapers have been marketed which include an elastic or stretch member in the longitudinal side edges of the disposable diaper to provide elasticity about the leg of the infant when the diaper is applied. Exaaples of such stretchable fitted diapers which have elastic members disposed in the longitudinal side edges of the diaper are shown in U.S. Patents 3,360,003 and 4,030,462. By being able to elastically contract the longitudinal sides of the diaper, which are the leg ard thigh encircling portion of the diaper once placed on an infant, you can compress the diaper about the leg of the infant. By virtue of this compressing, you reduce leakage at the leg of thE infant and the tighter you make the fit, the more you tend to reduce leakage. However, if the fit is too tight you will cause irritation on this tender portion of the thigh, especially when the diaper is wet.There are also a number of patents which disclose means for making the waist encircling portion of a disposable diaper elastic for tighter fit of the diaper about the waist of the wearer, for example, as shown and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,995,637 and 3,995,640.Disposable diapers usually comprise a facing and a backing layer which are substantially co extensive and a somewhat smaller absorbent core or panel interposed between the facing and backing layer. The facing and backing layers are adhered together about their perimeter by hot melt adhesive or other adhesive material as is well known. In producing stretch or elastic diapers, an elastic member in its stretched or partially stretched state, is interposed between the facing and backing sheets along one or more edges of the diaper. The elastic member is adhered either to the facing and or the backing sheets by adhesive or similar means and allowed to relax to produce elastic sections at the edges of the diaper. An example of a method for inserting elastic members in disposable diapers is disclosed in U.S.PatentNo. 4,081,301. The incorporation of these elastic members into disposable diapers has increased both the cost of materials and construction of disposable diapers. With solid elastic members, it is necessary to adhere the side edges of the facing and backing sheets together, either directly or by their mutual attachment to the elastic member. Also, the use of the same adhesive throughout the process of incorporating the elastic members into the diaper to simplify its manufacture, require that the adhesive should be compatible with and have dhesive qualities with the elastic member, the plastic film backing material, and the soft textile facing material.In addition, when adhesively securing an unapertured elastic member into a disposable diaper, the adhesive chosen must be elastomeric or must be applied in a discontinuous pattern or the glue may make the diaper too stiff to gather. In contrast, the apertured elastic members of the present invention need not be adhered to either the facing or backing sheets, and the adhesive used to secure the facing to the backing sheet need not be elastomeric and need be compatible with and have adhesive qualities with only the facing and backing sheets, and not the elastic member. Surumarv of the Invention Wbat we have discovered is an improved laminated structure adapted to be gathered for improved fit about a portion of a human body and a method of akin the same. The laminated structure comprises first and second substrates of flexible, gatherable clatcriall and an apertured elastic member disposed between the substrates. The elastic member includes a plurality of interconnected elastic elements which define the apertures therebet. een, and in the laminated structure the first and second substrates are secured together through at least of some apertures. The laminated structure of the present invention may be used in any fitted garment but perhaps, is most suited for use in inexpensive and disposable apparel.The laminated structure can be incorporated into the sleeve cuff, the leg encircling portion, about the neck, and the waist of an article of apparel.In particular, the laminated structure may be incorporated into both the waist and thigh encircling portions of a disposable diaper or other disposable undergarments.The improved laminated structure of the present invention reduces the pressure applied to the skin of the wearer, and, in a disposable diaper or a disposable undergarment reduces the possibility of irritation and rash when wet. Surprisingly, the apertured elastic member can be readily Inserted between the first and second substrates and these substrates easily adhered together to hold the elastic member in place, at high speeds, with good reliability and at reduced costs.Furthermore, using the apertured member of the present invention in a laminated structure vith adherence of layers through the apertures of the member allows for reduced thickness of the final laminated structure as compared to a similar structure using a solid elastic member wherein there must be an extra layer or thickness of adhesive on one or both surfaces of the solid member.This reduced thickness of the laminate along with the apertures in the elastic member provide for overall reduced forces in the final product mainly because of the reduced mass of the portion of the product to be gathered. This combination of reduced thickness and apertures also unexpectedly produces a more uniform distribution of the elastic forces which directly transmits into better conformity and improved fit about the extremity of the wearer e.g., the leg of a wearer in a diaper product.In accordance with the present invention, my improved laminated structure comprises first and second substrates of flexible, gatherable material and an apertured elastic member which includes a plurality of interconnected elastic elements definIng the apertures therebetween. The first and second substrates are secured together through at least some of some of said apertures. Preferably, the elastic member has a width from about 1 2 inch to about 1 1 2 inches and the member may have a thickness of from 1 to 50 mils and preferably from about S to 20 mils. The elastic member may be made of any of the standard film materials which are stretchable and are recoverable and have a modulus of elasticity at 100 percent elongation of from about 20 to 2000 lbs. sq. inch. In a disposable diaper in accordance with the present invention, the elastic member may be disposed between the backing and facing sheet of the diaper in the longitudinal side edges of the diaper.In one method of the manufacture of a disposable diaper incorporating the laminated structure of the present invention, the facing and backing sheets c the diaper are adhesively secured together as in the past i.e., adhesive is placed on the backing and the absorbent core is secured to the central portion of the backing sheet and the facing sheet is adhered at the edges. The apertures of the elastic member, disposed in one or more of the edges of the backing, allow the adhesive disposed on the backing to adhere to the facing sheet through the apertures.Also, when using our new apertured elastic member and adhering the facing to the backing through the aparatus eliminates the need to adhere the facing to the backing outside the elastic member as is generally required when a solid member is used.It should be pointed out that by using the reticulated or apertured elastic members in accordance with the present invention, the insertion of the member into the product and the adherence thereto is greatly simplified and, hence, has considerable economic benefit in the manufacturing process. The apertures or openings insure a uniform, intermittent lamination between the elastic and non elastic layers and reduce the criticality of adhesive application. Also, the openings or apertures combined with adhesion of the layers through these openings or apertures provides that the final lamination acts or performs in its stretch, recovery and similar elastic properties substantially the same as the original reticulated or apertures member, thus allowing for greater certainty in predicting the quality and functionality of the final product.In contrast to this, when using a solid elastic member, its performance in the final product with regard to stretch, recovery and similar elastic properties altered b the manner and degree of adhesion to the non elastic layers and by the properties of the non elastic layers.Furthermore when an elastic member according to the present invention having longitudinally and transversely extending elements defining square or rectangular shaped apertures therebetween, is stretched in the longitudinal direction, there is no necking down of the member i.e., reduction in the transverse dimension of the member. This transverse stability provides considerable advantages in the new and improved method for inserting elastic members in laminates according to the present invention as it is very easy to align the elastic member in a stretched condition at or near the edge of the material to which the member is to be laminated. Also, on relaxation of the elastic member, there is no widening of the member and concomitant widening of the bonds securing the member to the material to which it is laminated.Brief Description of the DrawingsIn the Drawings Figure 1 is an enlarged perspective view illustrating a reticulated elastic member which may be used in one embodiment of the laminated structure of the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view illustrating a disposable diaper in accordance with the present invention, with the diaper laid out flat Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view showing relative positioning of the diaper elements depicted in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the disposable diaper embodying the present invention Figure 5 is a perspective view showing still another embodiment of the disposable diaper embodying the present invention Figure 6 is a plan view of one embodiment of the disposable diaper of this invention with a portion broken away to show interior detail Figure 7 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken along line 7 7 of Figure 6 Figure 8 is a plan view of another embodiment of the disposable diaper of this invention with a portion broken away to show interior detail Figure 9 is a plan view of still a further embodiment of a disposable diaper of this invention with a portion broken away to show interior detail Figure 10 is a plan view of an additional embodiment of a disposable diaper of th.is invention with a portion broken away to show interior detail Figure 11 Is a plan view of yet another eglbodinuent of this invention with a portion broken away to show interior detail Figure 19 is a plan view of a disposable underglrment laid out flat, in accordance with the present invention with portions folded back to show interior detail Figure 1 is a perspective view of the disposable undergarment of Figure 12 viewed in the configuration it assumes when disposed about a wearer andFigure 14 is a schematic representation of one embodiment of a method of assembling the components of a disposable diaper according to the present .invention. Description of the Preferred Embodirmens For a laminated structure of the present invention, the apertured elastic member is a readily stretchable, preferably thermoplastic member that possesses a certain minimum elastic recovery.The term elastic , as used herein, refers to sheets, films, ribbons, filaments, and the like which have a recovery of at least 90 percent, when elongated to within 10 percent of their yield point and measured in accordance with the following formula Percent RetractionEMI9.1 where Lo original length of sample Le fully extended length Lt length of sample ezsured three seconds after release from extended length The thickness of the elastic member may be from about 1 to 50 ii and is preferably from about S to about 20 mils.They have a width of from 1 4 inch to 2 inches and preferably in diaper applications widths of from 1 2 inch to 1 inch have been found satisfactory. For ease of stecbility, the modulus of elasticity of the elastic ember at 100 percent elongation should not exceed about 2000 lbs. sq. inch. The modulus of elasticitv is preferably substantially less than 2000 lbs. sq.inch and most preferably is about 75 to about 400 lbs. sq. inch.The term reticulatc , as used herein, refers to a construction having openings or apertures, substantially uniformly distributed therein to produce a net like construction. As shown in Fig. 1, the openings or apertures 20 in the reticulated elastic member 21 may be rectangular in shape however, the rectangular or square configuration is not essential to the present invention and the openings may have round, oval, or other various shapes. The apertured elastic members of the present invention need not have the symmetrical, regular array of rectangularlike apertures of a reticulated member, but may merely include a plurality of interconnected elastic elements defining apertures therebetween. Depending on the modulus of elasticity of the material used and the thickness and width of the member, the number of openings may vary from two to 100 openings per linear inch in both the longitudinal and transverse direction of the member. In addition, the elastic elements may be of different widths in the longitudinal or transverse direction, and the spacing between the elastic elements may vary from the transverse to the longitudinal direction. Referring to Figure 2, a disposable diaper 25 embodying the present invention has longitudinal side margins 26 and 27. The central portion of each side margin is elasticated to provide improved fit about the baby s thighs. The elastic member 28 and 29 in each of the longitudinal side margins is a reticulated film member according to the present invention. Individual components of the disposable diaper of Figure 2 are illustrated inFigure 3.The diaper additionally includes a first layer or backing layer 30 made of a floisture impermeable material, a rectangular absorbent batt 31 superimposed over backing layer 3G and secured thereto by a series of glue lines 35 deposited on the backing layer, and a second layer or facing layer 32 made of a moisture permeable web and positioned in superimposed relationship to the absorbent batt. The absorbent batt is of smaller area than the backing and when substantially centered to tiie backing, is spaced from the longitudinal sides as well as the transverse ends of the diaper.The absorbent batt is f anked on its longitudinal sides by reticulated elastic members 28 and 29 located generally parallel the longitudinal side margins of the batt, and which, in an extended state, are secured between the backing and the facing by means of the adhesive lines 35. A moisture pervious facing 31 is superimposed over the absorbent batt and secured to the backing by means of the end and side portions of the glue lines 35. The facing is also secured to the backing between the openings in the reticulated film member.For securing the diaper about a baby, the diaper is provided with pressure sensi.ivre tape tab embs 5 and 34. In the tnanuàcture of the diaper, oul the central portions 6 and 37 or t reticulated members 23 and 29 remain elastic and are secured between the facing and the backing. tt sbould be noted the end portions of the elastic member winch are not adhered to the facing and or backIng may be reticulated or not as desired. The use of a reticulated or apertured elastic member provides a reduction in cost of materials over a solid elastic member of the same length and width used to apply a gathering force to the longitudinal side margins. The reticulated elastic member of the present invention may be produced by a variety of metrlods such as by passing an appropriate stretchable and recoverable film between the nip of a pattern forming roll and a back up roll in a procedure analogous to that shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,881,381 and 3,632,269. A technique that may be used in the manufacture of the diaper in accordance with the present invention is to apply the adhesive directly to the reticulated elastic member along the portion desired to be adhered between the backing and facing members. Another technique is to apply adhesive to that portion of the backing or facing layer to which the elastic member is to be secured. In assembling the diaper, pressure is applied to the diaper in the region of the elastic member to adhere the facing and backing together between the openings in te elastic member. The components of a disposable diaper may be assembled according to one embodiment of the present invention as shown in Figure 14.The backing layer 180, the absorbent pads 182, the facing layer 184, and the continuous ribbon of elastic members 186 are brought to an assembly station. The elastic members are stretched on their way to the assembly station b running nip rollers 200 at a speed lower than that of compressing roller 190. In this embodiment, adhesive is applied to the elastic members by nozzle 183. Pressure is applied to the diaper assembly in the region of the elastic members, by passing at least those regions through the n.n of compressing rollers 190. In X particularly pre èi.r d embodiment, the surface of one of the rollers may be resilient.The pressure applied to the diaper to adhere the backing layer to the facing layer may also squeeze a4hc s e through the openings in the elastic members, allowing one to adhere the backing to the facing X tien adhesive is originally valied to only one of the backing layer, the facing layer, or one surface of the elastic member.It is desirable, to aid in insuring that the facing and backing are adhered together through the openings in the elastic member, that the upper or top compressing roller 190 be made of a very resilient material or have a very resilient covering as its outer surface. The resilient surface allows the roller surface to deflect into the openings of the elastic member and press together the thin areas where only facing and backing layers are present.The portion of the elastic member not secured by the diaper components may be allowed to retract inside the diaper between the facing and backing and remain thei e. There are a number of ways that retractioii of a portion of the elastic member without gathering the layers of material may be accomplished. One such technique is to secure the elastic member with the facing and or backing layers only over a portion of the mer.lber. ssen the member is sub sequently severed in an uIIsecured portion, such as by a cutting knife 192 and back up roller anvil 194 to produce individual diapers, the unsecured portion of the member will retract to an area where the member is secured with the facing and or backing layers. Such retraction ill have no gather ne effect on the facing and backing layers. The elastic member may be left unsecured to the facing and backing layers at certain portions by a number of techniques such as not applying adhie to specific areas or eliminating the compression in specific areas until after the member has been severed or treain a portion of the elastic member with a release agent such as a silicone so that t will not adhere to the facing and backing layers or other similar processes for rendering a portion of the elastic member ineffective to gather the facing and backing layers.As previously mentioned, an important and unexpected advantage of using our new reticulated elastic member, having square or rectangular shaped openings, is that the member does not neck down i.e., reduce its width or transverse dimension when stretched in the longitudinal J direction. As can be appreciated, this is extremely important since the elastic member is in a longitudinally stretched condition when assembled in the diaper. The elimination of the necking down phenomena allows the member to be positioned with accuracy. The elastic member may be placed at the extreme outer edge of the facing and backing layers to allow for complete use of the layers in the final product without having to trim the edges and without excess material extending beyond the elastic member.Furthermore, the tolerance required to obtain suitable insertion of the elastic member into the diaper are reduced. The above advantages simplify the method of manufacture of the diaper and provide improved yields in manufacture both of which are economically beneficial. figure 4 shows another disposable diaper 40 similar to that shown in Figure 2 with the exception that all four edge portions that is, the two loitdil side margins 41 and 5 and the front As and rear 4.1 end portions all have reticulated elastic members iriserted brtl ccn the facing and the backing with the central portions thereof elastic.Figure 5 shows a disposable diaper 50 similar to the diaper depicted in Figure 2 with the exception that the reticulated elastic member 51 is in the central front waist portion 52 of the diaper to provide improved fit about the baby s waist.In the embodiment shown In Figure 6, a disposable diaper 60 is provided with a substantially rectangular panel 61 sandwiched between a backing 62 and facing 63 and together with the backing and facing define side margins 64 and 65. Curvilinear cut outs are provided in the respective central side portions of the facing and backing for further fit enhancement. Pre stretched reticulated thermoplastic elastic members 68 are positioned in the longitudinal side margins and are secured to the backing and facing along the longitudinal sides of the absorbent panel. The reticulated elastic members have been rendered inelastic at their end positions 69 and 70.A technique for rendering the end of a thertnoplastic elastic member inelastic is to heat the end sufficiently to remove the elastic property of the thermoplastic material in the heated area. Such a technique along with the related techniques which may be used to render portions of elastic members inelastic are disclosed and described in the co pending British patent application Serial No 7902909 filedJanuary 26, 1979, which is incorporated herein by reference. Glue lines 71 secure the facing and absorbent panel to the backing and adhesive tape tabs 72 and 73 provide diaper secureinent means.Referring to Figure 7, which is a cross sectional view taken along line 7 7 of Figure 6, there is shown the impervious backing member 62 with the reticulated elastic ribbon 68 secured between the backing member and tiio facing member 63 by the glue lines 74 and 75.In the embodiment shown in Figure 8, the disposable diaper SO is provided with an absorbent batt 81 and also having curvilinear side cut outs and sandwiched between faring 82 and backing 83 having similar cut outs. Glue lirles 85 serve to secure the batt and facing to the backing. Reticulated elastic ribbons 85 are situated in the general rectilinear diaper side margins. The reticulated elastic ribbons are secured between the facing and backing at the central portion 86 by adhesive lines 88 which may be applied at the same time as, and may lie along the same line as certain of the glue Lines 84. Protruding portions 89 and 90 of the absorbent batt overlap into the four corners of the diaper and tabs 113 and 114 adhered to the backing member.The embodiment shown in Figure 1.0 is a disposable diaper 10 which comprises a rectangular impervious backing member 121 it a smaller area of absorbent core 12 adhered thereto with glue lines applied to the backing member. On top of the absorbent core is the facing member 124 which is co extensive with the backing member to form the longitudinal side margins 125 and 126 and the end margins 127 and 128. In a preferred construction, reticulated elastic member 129 is adhered between the backing and facing members at the front waist nlargin 128. A similar reticulated elastic member may also, if desired, be inserted in the back waist margin 127 of the diaper. The adhesive tape tabs 133 and 134 are adhered to the backing member and are used for securement of the diaper about the baby.The elastic members suitable for use in the diapers contemplated may be made from films extruded, calendered, or otherwise formed to the desired thickness and pattern of openings utilizing low stretch modulus materials made from any rubbery elastic material. Specifically un vulcanized thermoplastic compositions which are made of an elastomeric component and an optional compatible modifier which is a thermoplastic polymer of a relatively low molecular weight but solid at ambient temperatures have been found to make suitable elastic members for use in accordance with the present invention. Illustrative of the elastomeric components suitable for present purposes are block copolymers which comprise terminal thermoplastic polymer blocks and at least some non terminal or intermediate elastomeric polymer blocks. Block copolymers of this general type may be prepared using a step wise polymerization initiator, e.g., an organolithium compound. Such block polymerization techniques are well known in the art. The elastic component can be linear or radial X 2 brock copolymers or mixtures thereof wit simple 1 B block copolymers wherein A1 and A2 can be alike or different and represent a thermoplastic polymer block, such as poly vinyl arene block, and B represents an elastomeric polymer block such as a conjugated diene or a lower i.e., C1 C4 alkene.The modifier component is a low molecular weight thermoplastic polymer having an average molecular weight of about 500 to 7,500 and is present in the composition in an amount of about zero to about 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the elastomeric component.A preferred thermoplastic film composition for the elastic members comprises an elastomeric component which contains, as a major constituent thereof, an unvulcanized linear block copolymer of the general configuration, A1 B A2 wherein A1, A2 and B have the same meaning as hereinabove.In these block copolymers, the A blocks are derived from styrene or styrene homologues, and the B blocks are derived from conjugated dienes or lower alkenes. The thefl plastic polymer modifier is compatible with the elastomeric component and associates principally with the thermoplastic terminal blocks of the aforesaid unvulcanized block copolymer. The thermoplastic polymer modifier preferably has an average molecular weight of about 1000 to about 3000, and is present in the film coposirion in an amount of about 80 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the elastomeric component. The preferred A1 B A block copolymers have A blocks derived, i.e. polymerized or copolymerized, from styrene or styrene homologues and B blo s derived from conjugated diens, such as isoprene or butadiene, or from lower alkenes such as ethylene and butylene.Small proportions of other monomers also may enter into the block copolymers themselves. The individual A blocks can have an average molecular weight of at least about 6000, preferably in the range of about 8000 30,000, and the A blocks constitute about 5 50 percent, preferably about 10 30 percent, by weight of the block copolymer. The average molecular weight of the B blocks for linear A1 B A2 block copolymers preferably is in the range of about 45,000 180,000 and th of the linear copolymer, itself, preferably is in the range of about 75,000 200,000. The average molecular weight of the radial .Al B A2 block copolymers prcferably is in the range of about 125,000 400,000.The term linear block copolymer or copolymers includes branchedA1 B A2 copolymers as well as unbranched A1 B A2 copolymers.The radial A1 B A2 copolymers useful for manufacture of elastic members for diapers of this invention are of the type described in United States Letters PatentNo. 5,281,383 to Zelinski, et al. and conform to the following general formula A B nX , wherein A is a thermoplastic block polymerized from styrene or styrene homologues, B is an elastomeric block derives from conjugated dienes or lower alkenes, as indicated above,X is an organic or inorganic connecting molecule it a function lity of about two to four as described inPatent No. 3,281,383, or possibly with 3. higher functionality as described in the Article entitled New Rubber is Backed by Stars appearin on Page 35 of the June 11, 1975, issue of Chemical Week. As used hereinabove, n has a value corresponding to the functionality of X.The preferred elastic member is highly thermoplastic and, though elastomeric, is unlike rubber in that it exhibits a relatively sharp melting point and is capable of being heat shaped. Also, tulle elastic member can form permanent heat seals to substrates such as non woven fabrics or the like, at relatively low heat sealing temperatures, generally not above about 350 0F. The member is very flexible, extensive and soft, and normally exhibits a Gurley stiffness of about one or less at a film thickness of one mail.Elastic members especially suitable for use in disposable diapers may be made frown combinations of thermoplastic rubber and amorphous polypropylene. The thermoplastic rubbers used in such combinations are block copolymers having blocks of polybutadiene or polyisoprene, and blocks of polystyrene. A review article discussing these materials is Structure And Properties Of Block Polymers And Multi phase Polymer Systems An Overview of Present Status AndFuture Potential , by S. L.Aggarwal, Polymer, Vol. 17,November 1976, Pages 933 956. Two representative types of thermoplastic rubbers useful in these combinations are the linear block copolymers A B A having a mid block of polybutadiene or polyisoprene and end blocks of polystyrene, and the star or radial bloc copolymers having from 4 to 20 arms connected to a common center. Each arm is anA B block copolymer, the inner portion being polybutadiene or polioprcne, with the outer portion being polystyrene.The material added or combined with the thermoplastic rubber, primarily to improve processability, while still retaining the characteristic rubbery properties of the rubber, is amorphous polypropylene. Amorphous polypropylene is a known material. It is essentially atactic polypropylene having an isotactic content of not more than about 20 weight percent, and preferably not more than about 10 weight percent.The amorphous polypropylene is employed in an amount sufficient to improve the processability of the thermoplastic rubber when extruding thin films or sheets. The exact minimum amount of amorphous polypropylene which must be employed varies somewhat from case to case, but it is usually of the order of about 10 weight percent, based on weight or rubber plus amorphous polypropylene, although the proportion may be as low as about 5 weight percent on the same basis in some cases. The upper limit of polypropylene will also vary from case to case, depending on the nature of the ingredients and the use intended for the product. At proportions above about 35 weight percent Con the same basis , a significant reduction in the characteristic rubbery elastomeric properties of the product begins to occur. This may be acceptable for some uses, and not for others. Thus, the upper limit of amorphous polypropylene would be that point at which the product still retains significant rubbery elastomeric characteristics.Other conventional materials, employed in the usual amounts, can be employed in the mixture for their known purposes.Such materials include pigments, anti blocking agents, stabiliers, anti oxidants, ultraviolet stabilizers bonding aid, aid, an the like.In some embodiments of the disposable diaper of the present invention, the elastic member is a member which ì l lN be maple elastic by imparting heat or other forms of energy to the member to shrink the member and provide it with elastic characteristics. A portion of the members is so treated to provide the elastic means while otr portions are not treated.Tile heat shrinkable films which may be used as elastic members in the disposable diapers of the present invention may be the polyolefin films which have been oriented to a degree and which will then become elastic when heat shrunk. Usually, a preferred technique for orienting the polyeti ylene film to provide the heat shrunk elastic properties is by irradiation such as suggested in British Pater o. 866,820. Also, useful as the heat shrunk elastic members are the copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, ethylene and ethyl acrylate, and the like. The forming of such copolymers is well known and specific methods of forming such materials are disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 2,200,429 and 2,953,551. After the copolymer is formed and made into a film, it is given the proper orientation as described in the previously mentionedBritish Patent No. 866,320. The apertured elastic member useful in accordance with the present invention may also be made from other materials such as, natural rubber, the synthetic rubbers, and the like. The member may be nadee in the form of a film with intermittent longitudinal portions that are reticulated separated bv nooi reticulated portions. The flin Is slit into the desired width and inserted between the backing and facing sheet of the diaper. Broadly, the elastic members may be . Je from materials having elongations of from 20 to 1000 percent and preferably from about 50 to 00 perccnt with in the range of 20 to 100 percent and preferably from 70 to 100 percent. The material should have a force to stretch it 100 percent of from 30 to 00 grams.The important factor to re oember is that when the material is placed in the end product the material be elastic as previously defined, so it functions z such an elastic in the final product. For example, in the diaper leg band area, the member should have 90 percent or better recovery in very short periods of time and preferably allaos X simultaneously, the member should also require a relatively low amount of force to stretch the log band area back to its original or non gathered length. Such force should be less than 200 grams and may be as low as 20 grams.The apertured elastic member may be sd ei.ed in the diaper by placing the adhesive on the backing and placing. the apertured ember on the adhesive. The facing layer is placed on top of the apertured member and pressure is applied by means of a roll to cause the adhesive to pass through the openings in the member and adhere at least the facing and backing together. Another technique is to place the adhesive on either or both sides of the elastic member and place the backing and facing on opposite sides and press together to cause the backing and facing to adhere. When the facing and backing are adhered together through the apertures in the elastic member, it is not necessary to adhere the facing and backing together outside the elastic member. In fact, when the facing and backing are not adhered together outside the elastic member, the edge of the diaper takes on a soft and pleasing ruffled effect along its edge.Though only the rectangular elastic members have been discussed above, it should be appreciated the elastic members could be shaped or curved as desired depending on the desired shape of the final garment.The disposable diaper 140 illustrated in Figure 11 has an hour glass shaped absorbent batt 141, a moisture impervious backing layer 142, and a moisture permeable facing layer 143. The diaper 140 has side marginal portions 144 and 145 with curvilinear reticulated elastic members 146 and 147 disposed therein. The facing and backing layers are cut out as shown to give the diaper an hour glass configuration.The facing and backing layers may be adhered to each other through the apertures of the elastic members and or may be attached to the elastic member. Tape tabs 148 and 149 are provided for securing the diaper about the waist of the wearer.Figure 12 illustrates a disposable undergarment 160 suitable for use in toilet training infants, or by incontinent children or adults. The undergarment has a front portion 161, a rear portion 162, and a crotch portion 163 comprised of an intermediate liquid absorbent panel 164 disposed between outer layer 163 and a moisture permeable inner layer 166.The waistband of the undergarment may be gathered by z reticulated elastic member s 167 located between the ends of the inner and outer layers at the rear portion nd optionally between the ends of the inner and outer layers at the front portion. The undergarment may also be provided with reticulated elastic members 168 disposed between the inner and outer layers at the site margins of the crotch region.rig. 13 illustrates the disposable undergarment 160 ofFig. 12 about a wearer in use both side margins 169 and .70 of the front portion being joined to respective side margins 171 and 172 of the rear portion to define a waist portion 173 and self fitting leg apertures 174.several different types of facing materials may be used for the disposable undergarment, for example, the facing may be a non woven web made of a mixture of fibers consisting predominantly of inexpensive, short, cellulosic fibers such as short wood pulp fibers or cotton linters in amounts of 75 percent to 9S percent, the balance being textile length fibers such as rayon as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,663,348 to Lloia, ct al.Non woven facing materials suitable for use in disposable undergarments of this invention can have fabric weights in the range of from about .5 to 5 ounces per square yard soon densities of less than .15 g. cc., generally in the range of .0z to about .1 g. cc. The dry strength of the facia sheet for a fabrIc having a beige of about 1.5 ounces per square yard is at least .15 lbs. per inch of wid h in the machine direction and at least .1 1b.per onch of width in the cross direction. Such fabrics hc. c good elongation, loft s ftness, and drape characteristics. Facings may also be made of an apertured non woven fabric which is formed, for example, in accordance with the teachings of commonly assignedU.S.Patent Nos. 2,862,251 3,081,514 and 3,081,515. Furthermore, facings may also be made from other types of fabric such as those disclosed and described inU.S. Patent No. 3,485,706 to Evans. Such facings can be made of naturally occurring fibers, synthetic fibers or blends thereof. Typical facing sheets made of polyester type fibers may have a weight of about .75 ounces per square yard.The facing may be the same size as, and coterminous with, the backing or alternatively, the facing may be wider p than the backing and have its side edges inwardly folded so that the facing is coterminous with the backing, as is shown in Figure 3 of U.S. Patent No. 3,612,055. In the latter case, the elastic members may be secured above the inwardly folded side edges of the facing. In addition, facings may be made from non apertured materials such as non woven isotropic webs or apertured polyolefin or polyester films having the desired moisture permeability. In all of the aforementioned facings, the materials should be relatively hydrophobic so as to retard wicking within the facing.The moisture absorbent batt or panel of a desired shape, but smaller than the facing and backing, can be formed in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 3,612,0 to leek, et al.A suitable backing material for the disposable undergareen s embodying the present invention can be an opaque polyolefin for example, polyethylene about .001 inch thick. Another suitable material for this purpose is polyethylene terephtbalate having a thickness of about .005 inch. In use, the disposable diaper is applied to the baby by laying out the diaper on a single 1 surface and placing the baby thoreon. The waist underlying end of the diaper is that end having the fastener means and the other end of the diaper extends downwardly between the baby s Is. Next, the downwardly extending end of the diaper is brought up between the baby s legs to a position covering the perineum and contiguous with the front portion of the baby s waist.The diaper therefafter Is secured to the baby by placing the corners of the waist portion of the abdomen covering end as far around the baby s waist as they will go and by bringing the corners of the underlying end of the diaper into an overlapping relationslolp with the aforementioned corners so that the diaper snugly encircles the baby s waist and provides a custom fit. The adhesive tape fasteners are then prepared for use and the diaper is brought iii a desired position by simply urging the pressure sensitive adhesive surface of the tape tab in contact with the adjacent outer surfaces of the opposite corner of the diaper. In some instances, it may be desirable to have a second fastener available that can be applied just above the thigh of the infant and below the standard fasXealer to improve and secure the fit of tie stretch diaper. The foregoing description of the drawings are illustrative and are not to be taken as limiting. Still other variations and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention
