## Description
Background of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention relates to a novel method of inhibiting detrusor muscle spasticity and increasing the force of detrusor muscle contraction. Such an invention has many novel applications including but not limited to the treatment of patients suffering from unstable bladder conditions. Description of the Prior Art The human bladder is composed of four coats serous, muscular, submucous and mucous. The muscular coat consist of three layers of unstriped muscular fiber an external layer, composed of fibers having for the most part a longitudinal arrangement a middle layer in which the fibers are arranged, more or less, in a circular manner and an internal layer, in which the fibers have a general longitudinal arrangement.In the external longitudinal layer at the sides of the bladder, the muscle fibers are arranged obliquely and intersect one another. This layer is called the detrusor muscle. Thiphenamil hydrochloride is a class of compounds comprising a di N substituted aminoethyl ester of diphenylthioacetic acid having the formula EMI1.1 in which R represents a disubstituted amino radical of either the diethylamino group, the morpholino group or the piperidino group. G4i22SS3 485G58 3 201 150.00 CK O4 2 4S505o 204 50.00 CK The prior uses for thiphenamil hydrochloride center around its use as an anti spasmotic agent in the upper and lower gasto intestinal tract for pylorospasn, spasm associated with the gallbladder and coson bile duct, as well as diarrhea and the irritable bowel syndrome. Prior art uses also include treatment of ureterospasm and bladder irritation. There have been further reports that thiphenamil hydrochloride has been successfully used for the treatment of bronchospasm. Thiphenamil hydrochloride is a well known compound and is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 2,390,555 toRichardson, incorporated herein by reference. Additional methods of making thiphenamil hydrochloride are described inU.S. Patent No. 2,510,773 to Clinton. The term Idetrusor instability generally refers to the condition wherein the bladder spontaneously contracts and empties before the patient is ready. Generally, the following compounds have been used for the pharmacological treatment of detrusor instability URISPAS flavoxate hydrochloride which is a smooth muscle relaxant tDITROPANS oxybutynin chloride an anti cholinergic used for the relief of neurogenic bladder symptoms and BANTHINEt methantheline bromide an anti cholinergic and anti spasmodic drug. For the most part, the above listed and other derivatives of atropine are unpredictable in their effect on bladder instability. In addition to their rather poor successful treatment record, anti cholinergic compounds produce undesirable side effects such as dryness of the mouth, dilation of the pupils and slowed heartbeat. In the uses of thiphenamil hydrochloride as a smooth muscle relaxant It has generally been assumed that the drug relaxes and inhibits the ability of smooth muscles to contract.This phenomenon has been shown in a number of studies 1.

As a result of these and other studies, persons skilled in the art generally expect the force of the smooth muscle contractions to be greatly diminished after administering thiphenamil hydrochloride. There has been a need in the pharmaceutical art for a drug which inhibits involuntary detrusor contractions while at the same tine increasing the strength of voluntary detrusor contractions. Thus, it is an important object of the present invention to provide a method for inhibiting unplanned or premature muscle contraction of the detrusor muscle while at the same time increasing the force of voluntary contraction of the detrusor muscle. it is yet another, important object of the present invention to provide such a method which is safe for use on human patients, particularly sensitive patients such as glaucoma patients without subjecting the patient to the undesirable side effects of anti cholinergic drugs, for example dryness of the mouth, dilation of the pupils and slowed heartbeat. It is another important object of the present invention to provide such a method of inhibiting unplanned or prenature muscle contraction while at the same time increasing the force of the detrusor muscle contraction without leaving or accummulatinp, any foreign substances in the human body tissues. Summary of the Invention These and other Objects are met in the novel method for inhibiting unplanned or premature detrusor muscle contractions while at the same time increasing the force of contraction of the detrusor muscle comprising the administration of a di N substituted aminoethyl ester of diphenylthioacetic acid having the formula EMI4.1 in which R represents a disubstituted amino radical of the group consisting of the diethylanino group, the morpholino group or the piperidino group. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a graph showing data taken from a subject with a normal detrusor under control conditions. Figure 2 is a graph showing data taken from the same subject used in Figure 1, after taking a dose of 400 mg of thiphenamil hydrochloride. Figure 3 is a graph showing data taken from a subject having an unstable detrusor. Figure 4 is a graph showing delta taken frox the same subject used in Figure 3, after having taken a 400 mg dose of thiphenamil hydrochloride 30 minutes prior to recording. Description of the Preferred Embodiments It is evident from the experimental results which follow that thiphenamil hydrochloride inhibits involuntary detrusor muscle contraction while at the same time increasing the force of voluntary detrusor muscle contractions.Apparently, the combined action of inhibiting detrusor spasticity while increasing the force of detrusor contraction is a unique property of thiphenamil hydrochloride and is an unknown action of any other compound. The advantage of this effect of thiphenamil hydrochloride .s that involuntary detrusor muscle contraction is inhibited thereby giving the patient effective bladder control.Furthermore, because the strength of the detrusor muscle contraction is increased, there is a more complete emptying of the bladder, even in cases where there is a partial obstruction such as in a prostatic obstruction generally encountered in older patients suffering from prostatic hypertrophy. The experimental results reveal that thiphenamil hydrochloride acts as an effective detrusor spasticity inhibitor and detrusor force of contraction increaser in a dosage range of from about 0.7 to about 11.4 mglkg of body weight. A preferred dosage is in the range of from about 1.4 to about 5.7 mg kg of body weight. A still more preferred dosage range is from about 2.8 to about 5.7 mg kg of body weight. Thiphenamil hydrochloride can be administered orally, typically in tablets of 100 400 mg or by intravenous injection necause thiphenamil hydrochloride slowly hydrolizes in water, it is generally not used as a serum or suspension.It is possible however to encapsulate microspheres of thiphenamil hydrochloride in the form of a liquid suspension for adminis tration to patients. The invention is further disclosed by. means of the following examples which are intended only as illustrations and which in no way limit the invention. Examples Urodynamic studies were performed on 20 women having a mean age of 28 7 years. Those studies incorporated water cystometrogram, UPP, and isometric tests. Control urodynamic testing without use of thiphenamil hydrochloride was undertaken in all subjects. The effects of a single dose of 400 mg and a single dose of 800 ng of thiphenamil hydrochloride given orally were compared with the control value for each subject.Specifically, the measurements taken included bladder capacity, residual volume, maximum detrusor voiding pressure, and isometric contractility during bladder filling and at bladder capacity. The results of these experiments are shown in Tables I IV. The experimental results show no significant increase in bladder capacity and a decrease in the detrusor muscle contractility of from 41.3 15.3 cm H20 to 37.2 16.0 cm H20 The test results further demonstrate that the isometric detrusor pressure during the filling phase of the bladder significantly increases from 36.1 26.9 cm H20 to 63.0 27.1 cm 1120. Referring to figure 1, data is shown taken from a subject having normal detrusor activity. The parameters measured include isometric detrusor pressure during bladder filling and while voiding under control conditions, EG and urine flow rate. Typical segments of a polygraph recording were obtained at a bladder volume of 100 ml segment A , 200 ml segment B and the voiding at 30C ml segment C . The parameters shown are detrusor pressure in cm H20, E 16 electromyogram recording showing muscle electrical activity and urine flow rate. This subject exhibited no detrusor instability during the measurements. The same subject was then monitored after a 400 mg dose of thiphenamii hydrochloride and the measurments were plotted in Figure 2. Three segments of a polygraph recording are shown at the bladder capacity and conditions described inFigure 1. As can be seen, the detrusor pressures in segmentsA and B in Figure 2 are considerably higher than the corresponding values shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 illustrates the voiding phase of the cystometrogram for a subject havin an unstable detrusor muscle. Spontaneous detrusor contractions are shown to precipitate voiding at a bladder urine volume of about 210 ml. The onset of voiding is associated with involuntary contractions series of detrusor pressure peaks between 0 and 50 seconds that are suppressed by increased EMG activity. The voiding was voluntary and complete with no residual urine volume. The same subject used in Figure 2 was monitored, and the results traced, in Figure 4 after being given a 400 ml dose of thiphenamil hydrochloride 30 minutes prior to recording.The polygraph shows that the pattern oi detrusor instability i.e., the series of increasing peaks in the detrusor pressure during the time leading up to voiding observed under the control conditions illustrated in Figure 3 has shifted significantly to the right as well as a general decrease in the height of those peaks. Hence, there is really only a significant detrusor pressure peak immediately before the onset of voiding. As can be seen from the EMG tracing in Figure 4, the range of fluctuations is greatly decreased indicating that the detrusor instability is nearly eliminated, In Figure 4, voiding was voluntary and complete.
