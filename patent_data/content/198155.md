## Description
Snowblower lawnmover.This invention relates to a Snowblower lawnmover.According to the prior art, solutions of single lawn mowers and single snowblowers are already known.The drawbacks resulting from said solutions relate to the maintenance of gardens and both of main and side streets together with roads close to private houses in places with cold winters and frequent snowfalls.Infact in such places in order to have the lawns mowed in summer and the drives and other utilization areas cleared from the snow in winter, two specific means are to be employed, one to perform the first task lawn mower , and the other to perform the second task snowblower .This invention is intended to provide a remedy to the abovementioned drawbacks. It solves the problem providing a lawn mower which can be turned into a snowblower by replacing and using some specific fittings. This is possible by employing an engine lawn mower which works as a real lawn mower if normally positioned and which works as a snowblower if rotated by 900 moreover, by means of an additional ground supporting carriage, a propeller fan, which replaces the lawn mower blade, and the work and control blade and different fittings, it works as a snowblower.In the case of an internal combustion engine I.C.Engine , both the tank and the carburettor are palced in a tilted position between the vertical and horizontal axis so that in either working positions the former normally supplies and prevents the leakage of fuel and the latter can always keep the normal expected performance.This is possible by inclining of about 450 the respective fuel filler and the working axis of the respective carburettor.This solution provides great advantages, namely a single means, suitably fitted, can successfully perform the two single and different operations.The invention will be now described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a snowblower lawnmover designed according to this invention, in its working condition as lawn mower Figure 2 is a side view of a snowblower lawnmover illustrated in fig. 1, rotated by 900 in its working condition as snowblower and, therefore, equipped with all the fittings necessary to be turned into a snowblower Figure 3 is a front view of a snowblower lawnmover in its working condition as snowblowertl, as illustrated in fig. 2 Figure 4 is a top view of the same snowblower lawnmover in its working condition as snowblower as illustrated in figures 2,3.This invention, as represented in said figures, consists of a traditional I C.Engine lawn mower m , with four wheels two front CI and two back 1 ones, a sliding handlebar 2 , with respective commands 3 . The lawnmover comprises a lawn mower blade, set in operation by the engine m and of a grass collector device 5 The I.C Engine m is characterized in that it has the tank s filler b , and the carburettor in an angle position of approx 450. llowever, it is placed in such a way that it always secures the normal and constant refuelling both in the normal position as a lawn mower horizontal position, fig. 1 , and in the upsidedown position of 900 to be employed as snowblower vertical position, fig. 2 .The conversion of the lawn mower into a snowblower can be made as follows 1. sliding of the handlebar from the normal back fixing in position to a fixing in position facing the engine 2. eployment of a carriage structure 6 possibly equipped with two back wheels 1 , removed from the back axle 13 , and fixed on one side to the front wheel hub 1 , and on the other 2 , to the handlebar 2 3. rotation by 900 of the lawn mower to enable the wheels 1 of carriage structure G to lean on the ground 4. possible replacement of the lawn mower blade 4 with a propeller fan 7 , to increase the performance 5. emplyment of a small conveyor box with a snow collector blade equipped with sled titans to enable the guide at. the same level of the ground and shock absorber springs 10 6. replacement of the grass collector device 5 with a snowconveyor discharge device 11 made of a conveyor piping with side snow discharge 11 , whose outlet 11 is angularly adjustable both vertically and circularly, alld frontly made of a screen grid shielding the propeller 12 . in this way the snow gathered and conveyed by the blade 8 towards the container 11 is sucked in by the propeller 7 , whose rotation conveys it to the discharge piping 11 .
