# Method of melting a fuse using a laser beam.

## Abstract
A method of melting a fuse is a semiconductor device including the steps of forming a passivation film 16 , which has an opening 17 exposing that region of the interlayer insulation film 13 formed on the fuse element 12 which corresponds to the region 12A to be melted of fuse element 12 , melting the region 12A of the fuse element 12 by radiating a laser beam on the exposed region of the interlayer insulation film 13 through the opening 17 , and forming a protective resin layer 18 on the whole main surface of the resultant structure after melting is completed. The opening 17 , which can be formed simultaneously with bonding pad openings, ensures that the fuse is melted more reliably and using less energy.
