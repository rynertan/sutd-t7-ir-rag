# Scaffolding systems and connectors for use in such systems.

## Abstract
In post and runner type scaffolding, a uniquely formed integral connector 36 is created from the end of the runner 26 or other similar cross member. The integral connector secures to a scaffolding post bracket 34 concentrically affixed to a post 24 and abuts forcefully against a convex surface of said post by means of a wedge 48 acting through the bracket. The connector has a longitudinally extending cross slot in its end of a width and depth to accommodate the bracket and dividing the end into upper and lower limbs. The free end of each limb terminates with the tubular walls thereof reformed from the tubular shape of said cross member preferably to a more flattened shape effective to strengthen and stiffen said limbs for their extended use of supporting scaffolding loads and connection stresses. A hole is formed in each limb so as to align with an aperture in said bracket to accommodate said wedge.
