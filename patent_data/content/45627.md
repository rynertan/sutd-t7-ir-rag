# Enhanced recovery memory metal device.

## Abstract
A sheet 10 of memory metal has a plurality of rectangular perforations 12 arranged in a rhombic lattice pattern, as indicated by lines 16 . On recovery, the rectangu lar perforations 12 become diamond shaped, thus giving enhanced recovery of the sheet 10 in a single direction 14 that is to say recovery enhanced beyond the inherent recovery of the memory metal.
