# A packaging machine.

## Abstract
A packaging machine having a film former for convert ing a flat, unfolded web of thermoplastic film material into a relatively flat rectangular tube with one major surface 37 of the flat tune having an inwardly turned edge 38 and the other major surface 39 of the tube overlapping the turned in edge. As the web of film is routed over and through the film former 18 , the flat rectangular tube described abouve is generated on a continuous basis and the product being packaged is simultaneously fed through the former and into the flat tube as it is generated. A side seal is then created in the overlapping area and, subsequently, transversely extending ends seals are formed to totally encapsulate the product whilse serving the web.
