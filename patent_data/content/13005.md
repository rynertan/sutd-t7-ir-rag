# D.C. transformers and multi terminal D.C. power network utilizing the same.

## Abstract
Multiterminal, high voltage D.C. power networks in which the sub terminals are electrically isolated from each other comprise D.C. Transformers, as the terminals. Each trans former comprises a large number of efficient, high energy batteries, connected as two separate groups one group made up of paralleled long strings of series connected batteries and the other group made up of paralleled short strings of one or more batteries each. Each transformer also comprises auto matic monitoring, control and switching means for periodi cally exchanging charged and discharged strings between the two groups, one of which the primary is connected across the supply lines from the power source s for the network and the other of which the secondary is connected across the service lines providing power to users thereof.
