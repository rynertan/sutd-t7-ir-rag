# Package for hazardous materials.

## Abstract
A package assembly for transporting hazardous materials including a bottle containing a hazardous material disposed within a metal can wherein the bottle is surrounded on all sides by individual upper, lower and side absorbent non resilient and frangible synthetic resin foam elements. The foam elements provide cushioning for the bottle and absorbency in case of spillage. The individual foam elements are maintained out of contact with each other by means of fiberboard spacers. The spacers are disposed to separate the upper and lower ends of the bottle from the resin foam and to protect the frangible foam from disintegration due to abrasion by the bottle. The metal can can be suspended with an outer corrugated fiberboard box by means of a fiberboard insert element for the outer box. The fiberboard insert element supports the can out of contact with the outer fiberboard box and provides a protecting buffer zone between the can and the walls of the outer fiberboard box for the protection of the can.
