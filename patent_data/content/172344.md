# POWER SAVING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A power saving system according to the present inven tion in a computer having at least one of a central processing unit CPU 1 , MODEMs 29, 37 , a floating point processor 13 and a floppy disk unit 23 has a common power supply circuit 59 , a power control port 41 connected to the CPU 11 , and a switch circuit 43 connected to the common power supply circuit 59 and the power control port 41 a power off control signal for turning off the unit which is designated to be turned off to the switch circuitry 43 . The switch circuitry 43 receives the control signal and turns off the corresponding switch to pass the power supply from the common power supply circuit 59 to the designated unit.
