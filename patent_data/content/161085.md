# Control system for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable belt drive transmission is provided with an additional operating range. A control system of the variable belt transmission 2 has a transmission ratio control valve 1 having a spool 46 which is moved in a downshift direction 44 to downshift the transmission and in an upshift direction opposite to the downshift direction to upshift the transmission. An actuator 48 is provided for moving the spool 46 . When an accelerator pedal 96 of the vehicle is depressed at the additional D L range, the actuator 48 op erates to move the spool 46 in the downshift direction, and when the accelerator pedal 96 is released at the D L range, the actuator operates to move the spool 46 in the upshift direction.
