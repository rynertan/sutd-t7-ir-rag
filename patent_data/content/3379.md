## Description
Tool for removing material. The invention relates to a tool for removing material, for exam pie, wallpaper and paint form a substrate, comprising a holder having a knife,or scraper that may be exchangeable and a handle. The tools, used nowadays, for removing material, such as wall paper from a wall or a ceiling, paint from doors, cupboards and other objects or for removing cement residues from floors, usually consist of a a priming knife or an ordinary knife. Apart from the difficulties invol ved in removing such materials with this kind of tool, this tool has the disadvantage that it may cause injuries due to more or less unskilled use, since the knife may slip by unexpected movements or abrupt disenga ging of material so that the tool gets out of control and may cause a wound. Therefore, a person skilled in the art uses, for example, a steam apparatus for removing wallpaper or a burner for removing paint. With re gard to energy such apparatus is often inefficient and cannot be employed by an amateur without risks. It is,therefore, desirable to have tools that can be readily han died by toth the skilled person and the amateur without practically any risk of injuries, whilst these tools should provide the same results as obtained by the professional tools, for example, a paint burner or a steam apparatus for removing wallpaper. his is achieved by the tool according to the invention which is chara ,terized in that the handle is provided with one or more supports for improving the grip of the tool. Since the tool according to the invention lies better in the hand and is provided at the desired points with supports, the tool according to the invention permits of exerting heavier forces on the material to be removed, whilst supping and the like of the tool is minimized. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show a few preferred embodiments of tools in accordance with the invention. Fig. 1A C is a plan view , a side elevation and a bottom view respectively of a paring knife. Fig. 2A C is a plan view , a side elevation and a bottom view respectively of a scraper in accordance with the invention. Fig. 3A C shows an alternative embodiment of a scraper as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 4A C is a plan view, a side elevation and a bottom view of a scratching tool. Fig. 1 is a view of a tool for cutting off wallpaper, for removing cement residues on floors or for emoving paint bubbles on walls and the like. For easy handling the hand grips around the handle 1 of the tool, between the support 6 and the end of the handle 7. By means of the screws 5 in the recesses 10 the knife 3 can be exchanged so that the tool can be used at low costs, since after a job only the knife needs to be replaced. In order to avoid penetration of the tool, particularly of the knife, into Ã…a wall or an object the knife 3 is rounded off at the corners 8.The knife 3 is disposed in an inclined position relative to the holder 2 so that at the beginning of the job for removing material, the material, to be removed, can be more readily worked over a comparatively small width, in which a so called carving pattern is formed in the material to be removed. At the transition from the handle to the holder stiffening ribs 9 are provided so that with a ninimum amount of material the tool has adequate rigidity. The tools according to the invention may be made from any suitable material such as wood, iron or synthetic resin, but for economic reasons it is preferred to make the major part of the tool fro a synthetic resin and the cutter or scraper form a kind of steel. Fig. 2 shows a scraping tool with exchangeable knives 23. This tool comprises a handle 21 changing over at the frost, where the knife is fixed, in a holder 22 provided with a wing nut 25 for fixing the knife or the scraping member 23 in a cavity 24. The knife or the scraping member 23 may be constructed so that it can be used both at the front and At the rear and be adjusted with the aid of the screw 20 so that by one movement two scrapings are carried out at a height 23 differing from the height 19 with respect to the object or the surface worked on with the tool,as shown in Fig. 2. With the tool shown in Fig.2 particularly the extensions 26 and 28 are important, since in using this tool the thumb will preferably be put against the extension 28 and the extension 26 will be clamped between the other fingers. Thus the tool can be satisfactorlly manipulated. As an alternative the hand may be placed between the extension 26 and the en of the handle at 27 so that the tool shown in Fig. 2 is gripped in the same manner as the tool illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a scraping tool comparable with that of Fig. 2, but in an alternative embodiment. The knife 33 is clamped in the holder portion 34 in a gap 35 so that the knife 33 cannot be exchanged. The scraping tool of Fig. 3 is intended for use as a dispenser tool that can be thrown away when its quality has deteriorated to such extent that it can no longer be successfully employed. The handle 31 has a downwardly extending support 36 and an upwardly extending support 38. The supports 36 and 38 are having the same functions, as the supports 26 and 28 of the tool shown in Fig. 2. The handle 31 does not have a bevelled end 37, where the tool 3 is preferably held between the supports 36 and 38. Fig. 4 shows a scratching tool. The handle 41 and the holder 42, which largely corresponds with the handle and the holder shown in Fig. 2.The handle of Fig. 4 differs from that shown in Fig. 2 in that the tool of Fig. 4 is not provided with an upwardly extending support so that the tool of Fig. 4 is preferably held between the support 46 and the downwardly inclined rear side 47. The scratching member 43 comprises a bent portion 49 and a curved portion 48 terminating at the bent portion 49. The curved portion 48 being located in the curved recess 44 of the holder 42, in which it can be positioned with the aid of a screw 40 and a nut 45. The tapering portion 49 serves for cleaning cracks, for example, in walls so that these cracks can subsequently be successfully filled with a filler. The limbs 49 and 50 are preferably at an angle of 95P to 1300 to one another. Although the end 48 of the member 43 may be used for scratching, this is less desirable on account of the nature of this tool, and, therefore, the adjustability of the scratching member is less required in comparison to the scraping member 23 of Fig. 2. It will be obvious that a number of variants of the tools as described above are possible, for example, by varying the fastening members or by combining tools within the scope of the present invention.
