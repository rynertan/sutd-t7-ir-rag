# Star delta change over switch.

## Abstract
Switch wherein fixed contacts q₁ q₄ , formed by bending conductive long plate members, are disposed at the top and the bottom positions of the pole chambers 3 , so as to provide the stardelta connection. The movable bridging contacts P₁ P₄ are provided with plate springs 5 on their backs. This plate springs 5 are pressed by cross bars 17, 18 to curve according to the tilting manipulation of the lever 6 to shift the movable contact in right or left directions to operate. The manipulation lever is provided with an erroneous manipulation preventing mechanism. This mechanism is composed of fixed concave portions on the top of the bearings and a control plate with concaves portions the latter is slidably moved by the lever 6 between the bearings. A key shaft is made engageable with the bearings and the concave portions of the control plate to holt the star neutral and delta position.
