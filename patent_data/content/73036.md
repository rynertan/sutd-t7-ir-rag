## Description
TITLE Toughened Polyamide Blends FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to toughened polyamide blends, and more particularly to toughened blends of at least one amorphous polyamide and at least one semicrystalline polyamide. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The properties of thermoplastic polyamide molding resins may be altered by addition of various additives to the resins, such as fillers or reinforcing agents, flame retardants, stabilizers and the like. In addition, other thermoplastic polymers, such as ionorneric resins, polymeric toughening agents and the like, may be added to the semicrystalline polyamide molding resins to enhance certain properties. Furthermore, certain amorphous polyamides can be molded to produce transparent molded articles. As with the semicrystalline polyamides, certain additives including other thermoplastic polymers can be added to the amorphous polymers to enhance certain properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In this invention, it has been discovered that blends of amorphous thermoplastic polyamides and semicrystalline thermoplastic polyamides can be toughened with toughening agents to a degree greater than that expected from toughening either polyamide alone. In its broadest aspect, this invention is a blend containing 1 99 60 by weight of thermoplastic polyamides comprising complementally a about 20 to 90 percent by weight, based on total polyamide, of a thermoplastic semicrystalline polyamide of film forming molecular weight, b about 8 0 to 10 percent by weight, based on total polyamide, of a thermoplastic amorphous polyamide obtained from at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid containing 8 18 carbon atoms and at least one diamine selected from the class consisting of i 2 12 carbon normal aliphatic straight chained diamine ii 4 18 carbon branched aliphatic diamine, and iii 8 20 carbon cycloaliphatic diamine containing at least one cycloaliphatic, preferably cyclohexyl, moiety, and wherein optionally, up to 50 weight percent of the amorphous polyamide may consist of units obtained from lactams oroF aminoacids containing 4 12 carbon atoms, or from polymerization salts of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids containing 4 12 carbon atoms and aliphatic diamines containing 2 12 carbon atoms, with complementally 11 1 40 by weight of blend of a toughening agent having a maximum tensile modulus of 80,000 psi, that is an organic polymer of film forming molecular weight which imparts to component a a notched Izod value at least 50 percent greater than the notched Izod value of Component a alone when 20 by weight of the toughening agent is present with Component a . The term thermoplastic semicrystalline polyamide means that the polyamide has a distinct melting point with a measurable heat of fusion as described below. Amorphous polyamides will generally have no distinct melting point nor measurable heat of fusion although with very slow cooling from the melt or sufficient annealing some crystallinity may develop. The heat of fusion is conveniently determined by use of a differential scanning calorimeter DSC . A suitable calorimeter is TheDu Pont Company s 990 thermal analyzer, Part Number 990000 with cell base II Part Number 990315, and DSC cell, Part Number 900600. With this instrument, heat of fusion can be measured at a heating rate of 200C per minute. The sample is alternately heated to a temperature above the anticipated melting point and cooled rapidly by cooling the sample jacket with liquid nitrogen.The heat of fusion is determinedson any heating cycle after the first and should be a constant value, within experimental error. Amorphous polyamides are defined herein as having a heat of fusion, by this method, of less than 1 cal gram.Semicrystalline polyamides are defined herein as having a heat of fusion of more than 1 cal gm. For reference, semicrystalline 66 nylon polyamide with a molecular weight of about 17,000 has a heat of fusion of about 16 cal gm. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The semicrystalline polyamides are well known in the art. They have a molecular weight over 10,000 and can be produced by condensation of equimolar amounts of a saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid containing from 4 12 carbon atoms with an aliphatic diamine containing 2 12 carbon atoms, in which the diamine can be employed, if desired, to provide an excess of amine end groups over carboxy end groups in the polyamide. Vice versa, the diacid can be used to provide an excess of acid groups. Equally well, these polyamides may be made from acid forming and amine forming derivatives of said acids and amines such as esters, acid chlorides, amine salts, etc.Representative aliphatic dicarboxylic acids used to make the polyamides include adipic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, and dodecanedioic acid, while representative aliphatic diamines include hexazethylene diamine and octamethylenediamine. In addition, these polyamides can also be prepared from self condensation of a lactam. Examples of polyamides include polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon , polyhexamethylene azelamide 69 nylon , polyhexamethylene sebacamide 610 nylon , and polyhexamethylene dodecanoamide 612 nylon , poly bistp aminocyclohexyl methane dodecanoamide, or polyamides produced by ring opening of lactams i.e., polycaprolactam 6 nylon and polylauryl lactam.It is also possible to use polyamides prepared by the polymerization of at least two of the amines or acids used to prepare the above polymers, as for example, a polymer made of adipic acid, and sebacic acid and hexamethylene diamine. Blends of polyamides, such as a mixture of 66 nylon and 6 nylon are also included as are copolymers such as nylon 66 6. Preferably the condensation polyamide employed herein is polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon , or a blend of polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon and polycaprolactam 6 nylon . With respect to the amorphous polyamides, by the term aromatic dicarboxylic acid is meant that the carboxyl groups are attached directly to an aromatic ring, such as phenylene, naphthalene, etc. By the term aliphatic diamine is meant that the amine groups are attached to nonaromatic containing chain such as alkylene. By cycloaliphatic diamine is meant that the amine groups are attached to a cycloaliphatic ring composed of 3 to 15 carbon atoms. The 6 carbon cycloaliphatic ring is preferred. Preferred examples of amorphous polyamides include a polyamides obtained from hexamethylene diamine and a mixture of 55 100 weight percent isophthalic acid and 458 0 terephthalic acid based on total weight of the acids , b polyamides obtained from i a mixture of 70 100 weight percent 2,2,4 and or 2,4,4 tfimethylhexamethylene diamine and 30 to Q weight percent hexamethylene diamine and ii 0 100 weight percent terephthalic acid and 100 0 isophthalic acid, wherein total weight percent diamine refers to total diamines present and weight percent acid refers to total acids present, c polyamides obtained from i an 8 20 carbon atom cycloaliphatic diamine with at least one cyclohexyl moiety and ii a mixture of 50 100 weight percent isophthalic acid and 50 0 weight percent terephthalic acid and 10 50 weight percent based on the total weight of polyamide of a lactam, W aminoacids containing 4 12 carbon atoms, or salts of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids containing 4 12 carbon atoms and aliphatic diamines containing 2 12 carbon atoms, d polyamides obtained from a mixture of i 40 98 mole percent isophthalic acid, based on total acids present, ii 2 60 mole percent terephthalic acid based on total acids present, iii 50 98 mole percent hexamethylene diamine, based on total amines present and iv 2 50 mole percent, based on total amines present, of at least one aliphatic diamine containing between 8 and 20 carbon atoms and containing at least one cyclohexane nucleus, wherein the mole percent acids present totals 100 and the mole percent amines present totals 100 . The amorphous polyamides exhibit melt viscosities at 3000C of less than 50,000 poise, preferably less than 20,000 poise measured at a shear stress of 105 dynes cm2. The amorphous polyamides can be prepared by known polymer condensation methods in the composition ratios mentioned above. In order to form high polymers the total moles of the acids employed should equal the total moles of the diamines employed. Representative preferred cycloaliphatic diamines containing 8 20 carbon atoms and at least one cyclohexyl moiety or nucleus include l amino 3 aminomethyl 3 ,5,5 trimethylcyclohexane, i.e.,EMI6.1 1,3 or l,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane, i.e.,EMI6.2 tb H2N CH2 SEP CH2NH2, SEP bis SEP p aminocyclohexyl SEP tb methane, SEP i.e., SEP H2NCH2NH2, SEP and SEP the tb like. As normally made the l amino 3 aminome thy 1 3i5,5 trimethylcyclohexane and the 1,3 or 1,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane arermixtures of the cis and trans isomers. Any isomer ratio may be used in this invention. Bis p aminocyclohexyl methane PACM hereinafter which can be used as one of the diamine components in this invention is usually a mixture of three stereoisomers. In this invention any ratio of the three may be used. In addition to isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, derivatives thereof, such the chlorides, may be used to prepare the polymer. The polymerization to prepare the amorphous polyamides may be performed in accordance with known polymerization techniques, such as melt polymerization, solution polymerization and interfacial polymerization techniques, but it is preferred to conduct the polymerization in accordance with the melt polymerization procedure. This procedure produces polyamides having high molecular weights. In the polymerization, diamines and acids are mixed in such amounts that the ratio Qf the diamine components and the dicarboxylic acid components will be substantially equimolar. In melt polymerization the components are heated at temperatures higher than the melting point of the resulting polyamide but lower than the degradation temperature thereof.The heating temperature is in the range of about 170 to 300 C. The pressure can be in the range of vacuum to 300 psig. The method of addition of starting monomers is not critical. For example, salts of combinations of the diamines and acids can be made and mixed. It is also possible to disperse a mixture of the diamines in water, add a prescribed amount of a mixture of acids to the dispersion at an elevated temperature to form a solution of a mixture of nylon salts, and subject the solution to the polymerization. If desired, a monovalent amine or, preferably, an organic acid, may be added as viscosity adjuster to a mixture of starting salts or an aqueous solution thereof. The amounts of the amorphous polyamide present in the toughened blend of this invention will be between 10 80 , preferably 15 508 by weight based on total polyamide present.

The samples were tested dry as molded DA M and after conditioning to 50 relative humidity RH equilibrium moisture by boiling in potassium acetate solution 1.25 lb potassium acetate per lb water . Flexural modulus was determined as described in ASTM D 790. Notched Izod was determined as described in The following examples illustrate the invention wherein the percentages are by weight unless indicated. The toughened polyamide compositions are prepared as follows The polyamides and toughener in dry form were mixed after weighing in the proper proportions by tumbling in a polyethylene bag. The mixture was then blended in a 28 mm Werner Pfleiderer twin screw extruder in which the hopper was blanketed with nitrogen and the vacuum port maintainedat abut 25 to 30 inche s vacuum. Extruder barrel temperatures were set at about the melting point of the polyamide matrix 100C, level condition yielding melt temperatures in the range of 50 to about 100 C above the melting point of the matrix. The beading exiting the extruder was water quenched, cut and vacuum dried overnight at 80 C prior to molding. Tensile bars 1 8 inch thick and test bars, 1 2 x 5 x 1 8 inch were molded in a 6 oz.injection molding machine at melt temperatures 100 to 300C above the melting point of the polyamide matrix. The mold temperature was about 900C with fast injection and a 20 20 or 20 30 molding cycle seconds ram forward second hold . The molded bars were tested in the dry as molded state and at 50 percent RH. The number of bars tested was sometimes less than that specified by ASTM. Controls A to E were prepared by extrusion blending 66 polyamide and amorphous polymer in absence of toughener in the proportions indicated inTable 1. The semicrystalline 66 polyamide had an inherent viscosity of about 1.25 0.10 measured as 0.5g per 100 iril of m cresol at 250C. End groups were 65 73 eq. of COOH 10 gm of polymer and 47 53 eq. 6 of NH2 per 10 gm of polymer. It had a heat of fusion of about 16 cal gm. The toughening agents used in the Examples had tensile moduli less than 80,000.

Controls F and G and Example 1, in Table 2 below, were prepared using the same polyamides as inControls A to E. The toughening agent for Control F and Example 1 comprised a mixture of a 10 percent of a copolymer of ethylene propylene hexadiene norbornadiene, 66 70 25 29 4.1 0.4 on a weight basis and a Mooney viscosity of 50 60 by ASTM D 1646 ML 2 0 at 1210C grafted with fumaric acid to obtain 1.8 percent fumaric acid graft, and b 9 percent of the copolymer defined in a but without carboxyl groups grafted thereto. The toughening agent for Control G contained 10 percent of a as in Control F and Example 1 and 9 percent of a copolymer of ethylene propylene hexadiene 70 74 23 27 2.4 with a Mooney viscosity of 42 54. The minor difference in Component b is not significant.

The notched Izod of the toughened blend of the two polyamides is, surprisingly, significantly higher than that of either toughened polyamide alone. Example 2 and Control H, shown in Table 3 below, were prepared in the same way as Example 1 andControls F and G except that 12 percent of the grafted ethylene copolymer was used as the toughening agent. Again, the product with the blend of polyamides produced the tougher product.

The ionomeric copolymer was an ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer of weight ratio 90 10 that is 728 neutralized with Zn ions. The copolymer was prepared as described in Rees U.S. Patent 3,264,272 and had a melt flow gms 10 min, measured by ASTM 1238, Condition E of about 1 after neutralization. Again, the blend of polyamides was toughened to a greater degree than either polyamide alone, as seen by Table 4.
