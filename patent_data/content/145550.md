## Description
NON REFRIGERATED SHELF STABLE COOKIE DOUGHS This invention relates to a shelf stable cookie dough which can be chub packed and is shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions. This invention also relates to a method for making the dough. Packaged doughs which are shelf stable for extended periods of time under refrigerated conditions are well known. However, such products generally require defrosting or the inclusion of significant quantitles of a melting point depressant to reduce defrosting times so as to obtain a readily formable dough.Additionally, they occupy valuable freezer or refrigerator space.Refrigerated shelf stable doughs are disclosed, for example, inU.S. Patents 4,372,982 and 4,374,151. U.S. Patent 4,372,982 discloses a dough composition for maklng thinly sheeted farinaceous food products such as a pie crust. Excessive browning during baking throughout 90 days of refrigerated shelf life is avoided by use of a flour having a high starch level, low enzyme level and minimal starch damage. U.S. Patent 4,374,151 discloses a frozen dough composition which is suitable for immediate baking when removed from the freezer. A melting point depressant, such as ethanol, is included in the dough so as to permit the dough to quickly soften in the oven as its temperature rises. Also well known are packaged doughs and batters which are shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions. Non refrigerated shelf stable batter compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,021,220, 3,753,734, and 4,022,917.. Dough compositions which are shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,769,034, 3,767,421, 3,767,422, 3,853,998 and 3,966,990. However, none of these patents teach a cookie dough which is shelf stable and sliceable into discrete pieces under non refrigerated conditions over extended periods of time.Additionally, none of these patents disclose a pumpable dough composition. U.S, Patent 3,021,220 discloses a pumpable batter which is shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions. However, the batters are high in water content and are prepared using heat sterilization, a water soluble acidic material and a microbiological inhibitor to achieve a sterile batter. A basic batter, it is disclosed, contains 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight farinaceous material per part of water and not less than one third part by weight sugar per part of water. U.S. Patent 3,753,734 teaches shelf stable pancake batters which may be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration in non hermetic packages. The batters have a water activity of from about 0.80 to 0.90. Water soluble edible polyhydric alcohols, which may range from about 20 to 35 percent of the batter, are used to obtain the desired water activity and resultant bacteriostatic protection. U.S. Patent 4,022,917 discloses a premixed batter which is shelf stable at room temperature. It has a pH ot about 5 or less to inhibit microbial growth. An alkaline leavening agent is encapsulated in a normally water insoluble edible material to isolate it from the acidified batter. U.S. Patent 3,769,034 discloses a dough composition of intermediate moisture for the production of flaky textured products, such as pie crusts, which doughs are shelf stable for months under non refrigerated storage conditions. The compositions include about 18 26 water by weight of the dough composition, about 20 35 shortening by weight, on a moisturefree basis of the dough composition and an amylaceous component.The composition includes a dough plasticizer, such as propylene glycol, dextrose, or corn syrup solids, and a mold and yeast inhibitor. The dough plasticizer is used in amounts of up to about 3X by weight on a moisture free basis of the dough composition. Incorporation of large amounts of corn sugars is taught as a cause of excessively rapid browning. U.S. Patent 3,767,421 discloses a dough composition which is shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions comprising about 30 to 75 amylaceous component by weight, about 0.5 to 202 shortening by weight, a starch tenderizing agent in an amount of from about 0.3 to 1.0 by weight, said percentages being on a moisture free basis of the dough composition, a mold and yeast inhibitor, and about 18 to 28S overall moisture by weight of the total dough composition. The incorporation of high concentra tions of sugar to stabilize intermediate moisture dough compositions, it is taught, results in very sweet products which are not very suitable for general use. The dougho produced in accordance with U.S.Patent 3,767,421 are pliable, elastic, bland intermediate moisture level doughs of the plastic and sponge type such as tortilla doughs, lexsa doughs, and potato cake doughs, pizza, bread, rolls, biscuits, and donut doughs. U.S. Patent 3,853,998 also relates to tortilla dough shelf stability. Esters of para hydroxybenzoic acids, it is taught, increase the shelf life of tortilla doughs under non refrigerated conditions. U.S. Patent 3,767,422 discloses a dough composition which is stable under non refrigerated conditions for periods of up to 20 months. The dough compositions are partially baked, have a moisture content of from about 18 to 241 by weight, based upon the weight of the dough, and are for the production of bread like baked goods. A shelf stable cookie dough is not disclosed. U.S. Patent 3,966,990 discloses a dough for puffable food products which can be stored without deterioration for periods up to about six months prior to baking. Refrigeration or freezing, it is taught, insures freshness of the dough. The dough comprises from about 30 to 70 percent by weight of a granular hydroxypropyl starch derivative, 0.5 to 10 percent by weight shortening, 0 to 2 percent by weight salt, 0 to 30 by weight other food ingredients, including corn syrup solids, and 10 40S by weight water. The present invention provides a cookie dough which is shelf stable under non refrigerated conditions for at least six months. Preservatives are not required to achieve shelf stability but enhance it. Additionally, the cookie dough can be formed into discrete coherent pieces by cutting, for example, at room temperature with substantially no crumbling during its non refrigerated shelf life. Shelf stability is achieved by using a lower moisture content and lower water activity than those encountered with conventional refrigerated doughs to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. In spite of the low moisture content, the cookie dough is still pumpable and can be readily packaged in a chub pack. A chub pack is a sleeve or casing, typically of a plastic material, which is sealed at each end. This type of packaging is widely used for packing cheeses and in the meat industry for the packaging of sausage, salami, bologna, and the like. Pumpability and formability are obtained by controlling the initial dough viscosity with syrups and fats or shortenlng. The present invention also provides a process for making a packaged, non refrigerated shelf stable cookie dough. The shelf stable and formable cookie dough of the present invention has a water activity of less than about 0.72, preferably less than about 0.70, and a pH of about 6.5 or above. The shelf stable cookie dough comprises a from about 5 by weight to about 20 by weight, preferably from about 8S to about 16S by weight of at least one corn syrup, or other viscous sweetener, for viscosity and water activity control, b from about 10S to about 25 by weight, preferably from about 14S to about 20 by weight of sucrose, c from about 13S to about 30S by weight, preferably from about 20S to about 252 by weight, shortening, d from about 25S to about 60 , preferably from about 30S to about 50 by weight, flour, e from 0 to about 3.5S by weight, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 by weight or an encapsulated leavening agent, f from about 0 to about 7S by weight, preferably from about 2 by weight to about 4S by weight of an edible humectant, and g typically from about 3 to about 25 by weight of conventional cookie texturizing and flavoring ingredients, said percentages being based upon the total weight of the dough and adding up to 100 . The total moisture content of the dough ranges from about 6 to about 122 by weight, preferably from about 7 to about 10 by weight, based upon the weight of the dough. Preservatives, which include mold and yeast inhibitors, are optional in the present invention.Viscosity control, to achieve pumpability, is obtained with the at least one corn syrup and the shortening. Typically, the weight ratio of the at least one corn syrup to the shortening ranges from about 0.3 to about 1. The shelf stable cookie dough is prepared by admixing all materials except for the flour, fat encapsulated leavening agent, and particulate flavorings to produce a smooth cream. The flour and rat encapsulated leavening agent are added and then mixing is continued until a substantially homogeneous mixture is obtained.The addition of the fat encapsulated leavening agent in a second mixing stage minimizes the breakdown of the fat coating. The particulate flavoring ingredients, such as chocolate chips, are then added with minimal mixing so as to retain particle integrity. The dough is pumped to a chub packing machine and packaged in a flexible plastic film. The product is shelf stable for at least about six months under non refrigerated conditions, and can be formed into coherent pieces for baking by cutting with a knife without substantial crumbling for at least six months. The shelf stable cookie dough can also be packaged in conventional margarine type plastic tubs and can be formed into coherent pieces by spooning. A water activity of less than or equal to about 0.70 in the shelf stable cookie dough of the present invention is achieved without the need for removing water or partial baking by using ingredients having a low water content or which tightly hold water. The ingredients used and their amounts should be such that the total water content, based upon the weight of all of the ingredients, ranges from about 6S to about 12S, preferably from about IS to about 10X by weight. At water contents below about 6 by weight, the pumpability of the dough and formability of the dough deteriorate. As the moisture content increases above about 12 by weight, shelf stability will tend to be adversely affected.Water contents within the above ranges or even above the above ranges, should be such that the water activity is less than or equal to 0.70 so as to assure the attainment of a shelf stable product. Generally, in cookie formulations which contain water absorbing ingredients, such as peanut butter, higher water contents can be utilized because these water absorbing ingredients tend to lower the water activity of the formulation. The corn syrup, or corn syrups and their amounts are chosen so as to obtain a cookie dough having a water activity of less than 0.72, preferably less than about 0.7. In addition to controlling water activity, the corn syrups are used to control the viscosity of the dough. These syrups improve pumpability of the dough by lowering its viscosity. Generally, the less viscous the corn syrup, the less viscous the dough. Accordingly, high fructose corn syrups can be used to reduce dough viscosities for easier pumping. The more viscous corn syrups tend to reduce pumpability compared to the pumpability obtained with high fructose corn syrup. However, as the viscosity of the corn syrups increases, the doughs tend to become more coherent and accordingly more sliceable into discrete coherent pieces.Suitable corn syrups for use in the shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention have a dextrose equivalent DE of about 36 to about 71. The dextrose equivalent is defined as the percentage of reducing sugars in the syrup, calculated as dextrose, on a dry weight or dry substance basis, according to the Handbook of Sugars 2nd Edition, Pancoast et al, AVIPublishing Company, Inc., Westport, CT, p. 172 1980 . Suitable high fructose corn syrups which can be used in the shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention have solids contents of about 68S to about 82 by weight. The shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention comprise from about 5 to about 202 by weight, preferably from about 8S to about 16S by weight of the one or more corn syrups, including high fructose corn syrup. At amounts below about 5S by weight, the doughs tend to become too viscous to be pumped. They also tend to crumble excessively upon slicing. At amounts above about 20S by weight, the moisture contents of the doughs tend to be too high so as to impair shelf stability. The risk of excessive spreading of the dough during baking also increases at excessively high levels of the corn syrup or syrups. A mixture of corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup 18 preferred for optimum control over pumpability and sliceability of the shelf stable cookie dough. Suitable relative amounts are about 30 by weight to about 70 by weight high fructose corn syrup, based upon the total weight of corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup. Other edible viscous sweeteners which can be substituted in whole or in part for the one or more corn syrups include invert syrup, aqueous solutions of corn syrup solids, mixtures thereof and the like. The shelf stable dough of the present invention also comprises sucrose which acts as a natural preservative in the dough and which also serves to provide oven spred and a crispy texture to the baked good. The amount of sucrose is suitably from about 10 to about 25 by weight, preferably from about 14 to about 20 by weight, based upon the total weight of the dough. Suitable fats and shortening are those conventionally used in the production of cookies and include animal fats such as lard, and tallow, hydrogenated animal oils, solid vegetable oils such as hydrogenated vegetable shortenings, such as corn oil, peanut oil, coconut oil and soybean oil. Mixtures of fats or shortenings can also be used. They may be emulsified or stabilized with mono glycerides or mono and diglycerides, or other known emulsifiers. Commercially available emulsified or stabilized shortenings typically contain from about 2.25 to about 2.75 emulsifier by weight. The shortening or fats should normally be solid at room temperature or above so as to avoid leakage from chub packaging and to provide firmness to the dough which enhances sliceability.Mechanical heat generated by low shear mixing fluidizes the fats or shortening which facilitates pumpability of the dough. Once packaged and held under ambient conditions, the dough increases in firmness as a result, it is believed, of fat or shortening solidification or crystallization.Fats or shortening which melt or become pourable at temperatures of about 850F to about 1100F, for example, are suitable for use in compositions of the present invention. The shortening or fat is used in an amount from about 13S to about 30 by weight, preferably from about 20 to about 25S by weight, based upon the total weight of the dough. The shortening or fat and the at least one corn syrup are used to control the viscosity so as to achieve a pumpable dough composition.Typically, the weight ratio of the total weight of the one or more corn syrups to the fat or shortening ranges from about 0.3 to about 1 to obtain a readily pumpable composition which can be formed into pieces by cutting, for example, during its shelr life. The flour is used in an amount of from about 252 to about 60 by weight, preferably from about 30S to about 50S by weight, based upon the total weight of the dough composition. The flour should preferably be a low protein content flour, which typically has a protein content of about 6.0 to about 9.0S by weight to reduce imbibing of the water supplied by the corn syrups. Wheat flour is preferred but other flours conventionally used In the preparation of cookies can also be utilized In the present invention. Gelatinization, by heating, of a portion of the starch of the flour is not necessary to achieve a shelf stable product even under non refrigerated conditions. The low moisture content, low water activity, the at least one corn syrup, the sugars, and the neutral to alkaline pH of the dough of the present invention make it unnecessary to include artificial preservatives or mold and yeast inhibitors for the attainment of a shelf stable product even under non refrigerated conditions. Molds grow at low moisture levels but a neutral or alkaline pH is unfavorable to mold growth. A pH of from about 6.5 to 8.0 is preferred in the dough compositions of the present invention. The pH is measured for a 10 by weight aqueous solution of the cookie dough. Edible organic or inorganic acids, such as citric, malic, or phosphoric acid or salts thereof,and or edible alkaline materials such as the carbonates of sodium and calcium can be used to obtain a desired pH. An antioxidant in conventional amounts can be used to enhance shelf stability over extended periods of time. Exemplary of antioxidants are ascorbyl palmitate, Vitamin E as dl alpha tocopherol, BHA, BHT, and TBHQ and mixtures thereof. Suitable amounts of antioxidants typically range from about 0,01Z to about 0.1 by weight, based upon the weight of the fat or shortening. Optional antimicrobial agents include sodium benzoate, benzoic acid, sorbic acid, calcium propionate, sodium proplonate, potassium sorbate, calcium sorbate, and the like. These preservatives can be used in conventional amounts which generally range from about 0.l5s to about 0.30S by weight, based upon the weight of the dough composition. The preservatives mag be used alone or in combination with preservatives such as sugar or corn syrup, and antloxidants. Leavening of the dough prior to packaging by the use of yeast is undesirable because of extended processing times.Additionally, excessive gas production by the leavening can be detrimental to package integrity. Chemical leavening agents which are only nominally active at room temperature and are activated by heat during baking contain a carbonate or bicarbonate salt and optionally an acidifies. However, even the nominal activity of these chemical leavening agents at room temperature is undesirable in a cookie dough which is packaged in a chub pack. In a chub pack, the dough is packaged with essentially no air space. Accordingly, over extended periods of time, the leavening activity would create undesirable pressures within the package which could lead to swelling and leaks in the packaging. Even though the doughs of the present invention are of low moisture content, the amount of water is sufficient so that reaction between the carbonate or bicarbonate and the acldifier would occur over time. Although the dough compositions of the present invention can be made without any leavening agent, incorporation of the leavening agent is preferred so as to obtain less dense products upon baking and to enhance consumer appeal. In the compositions of the present invention the leavening ingredients are protected from the moisture in the dough until the baking operation.Commercially available fat or shortening encapsulated leavening agents can be used. The carbonate or bicarbonate and optional acidifies should be encapsulated to avoid premature reaction.The encapsulated leavening ingredients are used in conventional amounts which generally range up to about 3.5S by weight, preferably from about 0.5 by weight to about 2 by weight of the dough. To avoid the risk of hot spots or local concentrations of leavening agents, which are evident as brownish spots in the cookie dough or baked cookie, finely granulated leavening agents should be used. Suitable for use are leavening agents having a sieve analysis of less than about 40 by weight retained on a 40 mesh screen or finer. Optional humectants, such as molasses, honey, glycerine, humectant gums, humectant gels, and mixtures thereof, can also be included in the shelf stable dough compositions of the present invention. The humectants reduce moisture migration to water imbibing ingredients which tends to enhance sliceability or the dough. The humectant should be used in an amount which does not adversely affect the flavor, color, or texture of the cookie. Suitable amounts of the optional humectant range up to about 7S by weight, preferably from about 2 by weight to about 4S by weight, based upon the weight of the dough. The texturizing and flavoring ingredients are those conventionally used in the production of drop type cookies. They are employed in conventional amounts and typically range from about 3 by weight up to about 252 by weight, based upon the weight of the cookie dough. Exemplary of drop type cookies are sugar cookies, butter cookies, chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, oatmeal granola cookies and oatmeal cookies. Typical cookie flavoring and texturizing ingredients include emulsifiers such as sorbitan monostearate, mono and or di glycerides, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as polysorbate 60 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbltan monostearate , and sodium stearoyl 2 lactate. They also include salt, whole egg powder, egg white powder, milk powders, pregelatinized starches such as pregelatinized corn, wheat, or waxy maize starch, peanut butter, peanut flour, vanilla, cocoa, spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg, particulate flavoring ingredients such as chocolate or butterscotch chips, cereal grains such as oats and rice, raisins, and nut meats. Commercially available chips which are coated with an edible shellac are preferred for reduced smearing into the dough during mixing or pumping. The shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention can be made by combining the ingredients in conventlonal manner USilig a creaming stage, and a dough forming stage. The fat encapsulated leavening agent should be added in the dough forming stage to minimize breakdown of the fat encapsulant. The particulate flavoring ingredients which are intended to maintain their integrity but which tend to smear upon mixing, such as chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and the like should be added last.They are added with minimal mixing so as to distribute them substantially uniformly through the dough without substantial destruction of the integrity of the particles. Generally, all ot the wet ingredients such as the at least one corn syrup, liquid flavoring and texturizing ingredients, liquid humectants such as molasses and honey, the shortening, and the sucrose are creamed together to form a substantially homogeneous mixture. Mixing is typically performed at ambient temperatures of about 650F to about 850F without external heating. Suitable mixers include vertical and horizontal mixers, such as conventional bakery typeHobart mixers. In the dough forming stage, the flour and encapsulated leavening agent are added to the creamed mixture and mixing is continued until the dough clears to obtain a substantially homogeneous doughs. The dry flavoring and texturizing ingredients and humectants can be added in either the creaming stage or the dough forming stage. The particulate flavoring ingredients are then added to the dough with minimal mixing. The thus obtained dough should be packaged within a reasonably short time, preferably within one hour, most preferably immediately, so as to avoid drying out of the cookie dough. For packaging in a chub pack, the dough is transferred, by conveyor for example, to the hopper of a conventional twin auger feeder, which feeds the dough to a positive displacement pump.The pump feeds the dough to a conventional chub packing machine.The shelf stable cookie dougha of the present invention are readily pumpable at pump pressures of about 150 to 200 pol. Lower or higher pressures, however, can be used. They should be high enough so as to permit continuous operation. However, excessive pressures may cause fat or shortening separation or bleed from the dough. To reduce the risk of separation at high pumping pressures, stabilized or emulsified shortening can be used. Additionally, minimizing the distance which the dough is pumped to the packaging device reduces the risk of rat or shortening separation. A suitable chub packing machine is manufactured by TheKartridg Pak Co. The pump which is optionally provided with these types of machines is not needed. The cookie dough is pumped into a formed plastic film sleeve formed by the chub packing machine. The sleeve is automatically sealed by the machine by clipping each end with preformed wire clips around each end to obtain a relatively air tight seal. The sealed package is automatically then cut by the machine at its attached upper end. Typical chub packing mechanisms and machines are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,149,447, 3,380,226 and 3,795,083.Conventional plastic packaging materials, such as those used for the packaging of refrigerated chub packed cookie doughs and cheeses, can be used. Typically, the chub packed dough is about 2 inches in diameter, is about 8 inches long and weighs about 400 grams. When packaged in a chub pack, the cookie dough of the present invention may be formed for subsequent baking by cutting the dough into disc shaped pieces as are the chub packed refrigerated cookie doughs. The shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention may also be packaged by pumping the dough into conventional margarine style plastic tubs with heat salable membranes or in line thermoform fill seal type containers. When packaged in thls manner, the dough composition is spooned onto a baking sheet. Other conventional packages, which are suited to the end use application of the dough, such as slicing or scooping lnto pieces can be used. The packaging,.however, should be.a barrier to moisture and oxygen, should not permit the escape of shortening or fats, and preferably should be a barrier to light.Additionally, the packaging should be capable of being tightly packed with a minimum of head space. The cookie dough may also be packaged in appropriate conventional cartridges for use with automatic cookie forming machines to produce a variety of shapes. The shelf stable cookie doughs of the present invention may also be formed into pieces and then packaged. In this embodiment, the pieces can be stacked and optionally separated by conventional non stick packaging materials such as wax paper or plastic film. Formation of the dough into pieces can be performed with aFay machine, where the dough is pressed into disc shaped cavities, or with conventional wire cut machinery. Cookie baking temperatures and times for thei doughs of the present invention are generally comparable to those conventionally used in the production of home baked cookies.Typical temperatures range from about 3500F to about 3750F, Somewhat shorter baking times or lower baking temperatures may be desirable in view of the low moisture content of the doughs of the present invention. Typical cookie baking times range from about 7 minutes to about 15 minutes, depending upon the number Or cookies being baked, the thickness of the cookie, the shape or the cookie, the size of the cookie, the oven temperature, the cookie ingredients and the texture desired. The present invention is further illustrated by the follow ing examples in which all parts, proportions and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in 0F unless otherwise indicated EXAMPLE 1 The ingredients and their relative amounts, based upon the weight of the dough, used to prepare a chocolate chip cookie dough are INGREDIENT WEIGHT PERCENTHigh Fructose Corn Syrup about 72S solids, 42 fructose 50a dextrose 10Sugar Sucrose 14.5 Shortening melting point of about 106 F 23FlourChocolate Chips 9Fat encapsulated Soda Sodium Bicarbonate 1Molasses 0.5Salt, Sodium Monostearate, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Stearoyl 2 lactate, and flavor 2.5Other Minor Flavoring and Texturizing Ingredients pregelatinized corn starch, egg white powder, milk powder 4.5 100 The high fructose corn syrup, sugar, shortening, molasses, salt, sodium monostearate, polysorbate 60, sodium stearoyl 2lactate, and flavor are mixed together to produce a smooth cream. The flour, other minor texturizing and flavoring ingredients, and fat encapsulated leavening agent are added to the creamy mixture and mixing is continued to obtain a substantially homogeneous dough. The fat encapsulated sodium bicarbonate had a typical sieve analysis of 20 mesh 1.4 by weight retained, 40 mesh 36 by weight retained, 60 mesh 54 by weight retained, 80 mesh 7.52 by weight retalned, 100 mesh 1X by weight retained, and 140 mesh 0.3X by weight retained. The chocolate chips are then added to the dough with minimal mixing to distribute the chips substantially uniformly throughout the dough. This final dough is transferred to a hopper and then fed by means of a pump feeder having a twin auger to a 2 hp positive displacement Waukesha pump.The dough is pumped to a Kartridg Pak chub packing machine where it is packaged into a chub pack approximately eight inches long by about 2 inches in diameter. The final dough was analyzed by conventional means, and was found to have a moisture content of about 7.3 by weight, and a water activity of about 0.63. The pH of a 10 by weight aqueous solution of the final dough was about 7.0. The packaged dough was subjected to a shelf life test at a temperature of 720F for 6 months.
