# Magneto optic memory element.

## Abstract
A magneto optic memory element includes a transpa rent substrate, a first transparent nitride film, a GdTbFe recording layer, a second transparent nitride film, and a reflection film formed in this order. The first transparent nitride film has an index of refraction higher than that of the second transparent nitride film. In a preferred form, the first transparent nitride film is a SiN film having the index of refraction of about 2.0, and the second transparent nitride film is an AlN film having the index of refraction of about 1.8 to 1.9.
