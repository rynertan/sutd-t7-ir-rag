## Description
This invention relates to semiconductor devices comprising insulated gate field effect transistors, for example, lateral field effect transistors of the DMOS type, employing conductivity modulation and relates particularly but not exclusively to such devices designed for high voltage operation. European patent application EP A 0 115 098 discloses a semiconductor device comprising an insulated gate field effect transistor having a semiconductor body with a body portion forming a drain drift region of one conductivity type. A current path extends through the drain drift region to a conduction channel region of the insulated gate field effect transistor. A minority carrier injector region forms a barrier with the drain drift region in the vicinity of the current path, and there is an electrical connection to the injector region for applying a voltage to the injector region to forward bias the barrier whereby minority charge carriers characteristic of the opposite conductivity type are injected into the drain drift region to modulate the conductivity of the drain drift region. The device disclosed in EP A 0 115 098 is an insulated gate field effect transistor of the lateral DMOS type. The drain drift region is of high resistivity and is formed by an epitaxial layer of one conductivity type on a substrate of the opposite conductivity type. A source region of said one conductivity type is provided in a device region of said opposite conductivity type. This device region provides the transistor conduction channel region below an insulated gate and forms with the drain drift region a However, because the transistor is of the lateral type, the current path between source and drain regions extends over a significant length in the high resistivity epitaxial layer forming the drain drift region. This geometrical layout of the regions of the device confines the conductivity modulation to an area close to the injector region because injected minority carriers are removed by both the upper major surface of the epitaxial layer and by the underlying substrate. Furthermore to obtain good isolation between the active device area and the substrate the minority carrier diffusion length in the epitaxial layer needs to be short compared with the thickness of the layer. Therefore the conductivity modulation may be ineffective over part of the current path in the drain drift region. The transistor of EP A 0 115 098 is a four terminal device, as an extra terminal is provided for the electrical connection to the injector region. According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor device comprising an insulated gate field effect transistor and having a semiconductor body with a body portion forming a drain drift region of one conductivity type, a drain region of said one conductivity type, a current path extending from said drain region through the drain drift region to a conduction channel region underlying an insulated gate of the transistor, a minority carrier injector region forming a barrier with the drain drift region in the vicinity of the current path, and an electrical connection to the injector region for applying a voltage to the injector region to forward bias the barrier whereby minority charge carriers characteristic of the opposite conductivity type are injected into the drain drift region to modulate the conductivity of the drain drift region, characterised in that at least one further region of said opposite conductivity type is present in a part of the drain drift region separating the conduction channel region from the injector region and in the vicinity of the current path through the drain drift region so as to be spaced from the injector region by a distance which is at most twice a carrier diffusion length for the minority charge carriers in the drain drift region, which further region floats at a potential dependent on the minority carrier injection from the injector region and serves to inject minority charge carriers which are characteristic of said opposite conductivity type into an area of the drain drift region remote from the injector region. By providing in this manner at least one such further region in the vicinity of the current path in a device in accordance with the invention the minority carrier injection is spread from the vicinity of the injector region into an area of the drain drift region remote from the injector region, so providing conductivity modulation of the current path in that area. The invention may be used to provide conductivity modulation in areas of the drain drift region even further remote from the injector region. Thus, the further region may be one of a plurality of further regions of the opposite conductivity type which are present in a part of the drain drift region separating the conduction channel region from the injector region and in the vicinity of the current path through the drain drift region so as to be spaced from each other by at most twice a carrier diffusion length for the minority charge carriers in the drain drift region, which further regions float at potentials dependent on the minority carrier injection from the injector region and serve to inject minority charge carriers into areas of the drain drift region remote from the injector region. This permits the on resistance of the device resulting from even a long current path in the drain drift region to be significantly reduced, even when the drain drift region has a high resistivity to provide a high breakdown voltage and has a short diffusion length to improve isolation or to increase speed of operation. The invention can be used to considerable advantage in reducing the on resistance of a device wherein the drain drift region is of higher resistivity than a device region of said opposite conductivity type which forms a A wide variety of arrangements and geometries can be adopted for the minority carrier injector region, the one or more further regions and where applicable said device region of said opposite conductivity type so that a particular arrangement compatible with the desired geometry and characteristics of a particular semiconductor device can be adopted. In devices of the lateral type having a first and second electrode connections at one major surface of the body, the current path in the drain drift region may have a significant length and the drain drift region may have a high resistivity to provide a high breakdown voltage. In this situation it is particularly advantageous to obtain a progressive spatial spread of either or both the minority carrier injection and electrical field. In order to achieve this, at least some of said further regions may be arranged successively in a series extending away from the barrier formed by the injector region and or from the When a series of such further regions is provided within the spread of a depletion layer from a reverse biased Depending on the particular semiconductor device the injector region may be a metal layer which forms a Schottky barrier with the semiconductor material at the body surface. However, in most devices the minority carrier injector region may be formed by a region of said opposite conductivity type in the body and forming a In order to simplify the electrode arrangement, the electrode connection to the injector region may also form a drain electrode connection of the transistor. Embodiments of the invention will now to be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which It should be noted that all of the Figures are diagrammatic and not drawn to scale. The relative dimensions and proportions of parts of these Figures particularly some of the thicknesses have been shown exaggerated or diminished for the sake of clarity and convenience in the drawings. The same reference signs as used in one embodiment are generally used when referring to corresponding or similar parts in other embodiments. The device of Figures 1 to 3 comprises an insulated gate field effect transistor and has a semiconductor body 10, for example of monocrystalline silicon, with a body portion 1 forming a drain drift region of one conductivity type Further regions 8 of said opposite conductivity type The device region 3 of said opposite conductivity type p type in this example forms with the drain drift region 1 a The device of Figures 1 to 3 is an insulated gate field effect transistor of the lateral DMOS type. The drain drift region 1 is lowly doped denoted N in Figures 1 to 3 and is present as an epitaxial layer on a Four floating regions 8 are illustrated by way of example in Figures 1 to 3. These four regions 8 are arranged successively in a series extending in one direction away from the barrier 7 formed by the minority carrier injector region 6 and in the opposite direction away from the It will be evident that other dimensions may be adopted and many modifications are possible. Thus, for example, the efficiency of the minority carrier injection 18 can be increased by reducing the spacing of the regions 8 and 6, for example to a carrier diffusion length L or less, and the spacing may vary for the different regions 8 in the different areas to control the injection 18 in these areas according to an optimum pattern along the current path 20. However, the spacing should not be too large i.e. not greater than 2.L or the efficiency of minority carrier collection and reinjection by the regions 8 will be so poor as to have a negligible conductivity modulation effect in that area. The minority carrier injector region 6 may be broken up into more than one region 6 all of which may still be contacted by the electrode 12. Furthermore, instead of each successive floating region 8 in the series being a single continuous stripe, each stripe may be broken up in its direction of length so as to form a two dimensional array of floating regions 8 between the device region 3 and injector region 6 or regions 6. A larger or smaller number of floating regions 8 may be provided in the series, or in some devices it may be sufficient to provide merely one floating region 8 of appropriate shape. Figure 4 illustrates another possibility in which the floating regions 8 in the series are part of an annular structure 8, 8
