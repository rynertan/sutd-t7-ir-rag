# Burnishing rack.

## Abstract
A rack 12,14 for burnishing toothed gears 16 is disclosed as having an elongated body of a multiple section construction that provides accentuated axial crowns to gear teeth 46 burnished by the rack 12,14 . Leading and trailing sections 36,38 of the rack each have a tooth forming face 44 that provides the rotary support for the gear 16 and the burnishing of the gear teeth 46 as the gear 16 rotates between a cooperative pair of the racks 12,14 . One of the toothed forming faces 44 , preferably the trailing one 38 , is slightly inclined with respect to the other rack section 36 in a lateral direction along the elongated length of the body so as to provide the accentuated axial crowns on the burnished gear teeth 46 . Both the leading and trailing rack sections 36,38 are preferably mounted on a base 40 that intercon nects the rack sections 36,38 . One preferred embodiment has a unitary trailing rack section 38 whose toothed forming face 44 is inclined in a single direction, while another preferred embodiment has a trailing rack section 38 of a two piece construction with the toothed forming face 44 thereof having a shallow V shape.
