## Description
CARBAMATE INSECTICIDES This invention relates to new compounds having insecticidal activity. The N methylcarbamates represent a widely used group of insecticides. Examples of commercially available compounds are carbofuran, methomyl, bendiocarb, aldicarb and propoxur. The high mammalian toxicity of many carbamates can restrict their use. particularly against animalbectoparasites. One attempt to overcome this problem is to form sulphenyl derivatives of the carbamates which it is believed are more easily metabolised to the active parent carbamate by insects or acarids than by mammals, thus creating a greater safety margin in use than with the corresponding methylcarbamate without the sulphenyl group.Often however the sulphenyl derivatives will have an insect toxicity which is too low to make the product of practical value against particular insects or other pests, althoughsthere are now sulphenyl derivatives of carbofuran which are commercially available. There is a wide literature on aminosulphenyl derivatives of various carbamates and especially carbofuran. Thus for example the di n butylaminosulphenyl derivative which is now marketed and has the common name carbosulfan. is described and claimed in GB 1439112. An improved process for producing carbosulfan is described in EP 51273. This patent also lists a wide range of carbamates that can be sulphenylated and an even wider range of sulphenylating agents. We have found that bendiocarb can be sulphenylated by a small group of sulphenylating agents to produce compounds having particularly valuable insecticidal activity. There is no suggestion or reason in EP 51273 for selecting this particular combination or that having done so the compounds would have good insecticidal activity. There have been very few specific disclosures of aminosulphenyl derivatives of bendiocarb.Thus EP 7398 claims a double molecule of bendiocarb in which the bendiocarb groups are linked by a sulphur atom. The only other specific disclosures we are aware of. are to arylsulphonylaminosulphenyl derivatives of bendiocarb, as for instance in GB Patent Nos 1403170 and 1454740. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared in conventional manner by reacting bendiocarb with a sulphenyl halide. We have also found however that the products can be prepared by reacting an imido sulphenyl derivative of bendiocarb with an amine. We have discovered that this reaction enables the preparation of aminosulphenyl derivatives in which the amine group is monosubstituted. Further we have found that monosubstituted aminosulphenyl derivatives of other carbamates can be prepared by an analogous reaction. In spite of the wide literature on aminosulphenyl derivatives of carbamates we are not aware of any disclosure of monosubstituted aminosulphenyl derivatives. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I.EMI3.1 in which a Z is 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 benzodioxol 4 yl andR1 and R2 which may be the same or different, are alkyl or cycloalkyl or together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a 5 to 7 membered ring which may contain other hetero atoms and may be substituted, or b Z is the residue of a carbamate insecticide of formula Z OCONCH3, R1 is hydrogen and R2 is optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted cycloalkyl. When R1 or R2 are alkyl these are usually of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, expecially 3 to 4 carbon atoms and when substituted, the substitutent is usually alkoxy e.g.methoxy or phenyl. When R1 and R2 form a ring this is preferably morpholino or piperidino. Other rings can include pyrrolidino. Substitutents can include alkyl or oxo groups and two substituents may form a benzo ring fused to the heterocyclic ring. Cycloalkyl groups are usually of 5 to 7, especially 5 to 6, carbon atoms and may be substituted. e.g. by alkyl, such as methyl. Z can be the residue of any known carbamate insecticide and is generally selected from phenyl substituted by one or more groups selected from alkyl alkoxy, alkylthio and N,N dimethylformamido l naphthyl 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 benzodioxol 4 yl 2,3 dihydro 2.2 dimethylbenzofuran 7 yl or an imino group of formula R8R9C N . in which H is hydrogen. alkyl or dialkylcarbamoyl and 9 is alkylthio. alkylthioalkyl or alkylsulphonylalkyl. Preferred groups include those where Z is a EMI4.1 where A is oxygen or methylene b 2 isopropoxyphenyl, or c l methylthioethylimino. The compounds of the invention have insecticidal and acaricidal activity and are particularly useful in combating a variety of economically important insects , and acarids including animal ectoparasites, e.g. Lepidoptera, including Spodopters littoralis, Heliothi8 armiaera, andPieris brassicae Diptera, including Musca domestica, Ceratitis o cantata, Erioischia brassicae, Lucilia sericata and Andes aeatPti Homoptera, including aphids such asMeaoura viciae and Nilapariata lugens Coleoptera, including Phaedon cochleariae, Anthonomus grandis and corn rootworms Diabrotica spp. eg.

Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application. As a dispersion. the composition comprises a compound of the invention dispersed in a liquid medium. preferably water. It is often convenient to supply the consumer with a primary composition which can be diluted with water to form a dispersion having the desired concentration. The primary composition can be provided in any one of the following forms. It can be a dispersible solution which comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent.

An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water immiscible solvent together with an emulsifying agent and which is formed into an emulsion on mixing with water. A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed with a solid pulverulent diluent, for example, kaolin. A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those which may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods. Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient adsorbed or absorbed on a pre granular diluent.for example, Fuller s earth, attapulgite or limestone grit. A wettable powder usually comprises the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay. Another suitable concentrate, particularly when the product is a solid, is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. Baits can include an attractant and may comprise a protein hydrolysate e.g. for the control of fruit flies.sugar e.g. for the control of adult Musca spp. or corn cob e.g. for the control of cockroaches. The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention is preferably within the range of 1 to 30 per cent by weight, especially 5 to 30 per cent by weight. In a primary composition the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example. from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a when , R1 is not hydrogen, by reacting a compound of formula II ZOCONHCH3 II with a compound of formula III RlR2NSQ III where Q is a leaving group such as halogen e.g. chlorine, or b by reacting a compound of formula IV EMI10.1 where Y is a leaving group such as an imido group, with a compound. R1R2NH. Examples of suitable imido groups include euccinimido or phthalimido. The reaction between compounds II and III is preferably carried out according to the method claimed inEuropean Patent Specification No 51273 in which as catalyst there is used a complex of sulphur dioxide and a trialkylamine. The sulphur dioxide is preferably generated in situ by reacting a compound R1R2NS 2 with sulphuryl chloride. The disulphide itself can be prepared by reacting R1R2NH with sulphur chloride. Compounds of formula IV may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II with a compound Y S X where X is a leaving group e.g. halogen, especially chlorine.
