# Glassware inspection using optical streak detection.

## Abstract
A translucent article 100 for inspection is illuminated and a portion thereof optically scanned by a scanner 60 having a matrix of video elements while relative motion takes place between the article and the scanner. The optical signals 121 derived from the video elements are summed to provide an array 275 of line sum signals 140 and the line sum signals are compared with a predetermined defect standard. A streak indicated by brighter than normal or darker than normal conditions in a series of line sum signals can be detected.
