# Process for producing mixed tertiary amine oxide.

## Abstract
A process for producing an aqueous solution of a straight chain alkyl tertiary amine oxide and a branched chain alkyl tertiary amine oxide by reacting aliphatic tertiary amines with a aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is disclosed. In this process, a tertiary amine which mainly consists of a branched chain tertiary amine is first reacted with excess hy drogen peroxide, and then, a straight chain alkyl tertiary amine which is substantially free of a branched chain alkyl group is added to the reaction mixture for permitting further reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The process achieves a high overall conversion of the starting amines, and the final product has an extremely low level of residual hydrogen peroxide.
