# Methods of and apparatus for forming conductive patterns on a substrate.

## Abstract
A method of forming an electrically conductive pattern on a substrate includes the steps of forming a layer of gold 6 on an electrically insulating substrate 2 and coating the gold layer 6 with a photo resist 8 . The resist 8 is exposed to light through a photo mask and the exposed portions of the photo resist 8 are selectively removed by etching. The now exposed parts of the gold layer 6 are coated with copper 12 and the remaining photo resist 8 is removed. The exposed parts of the gold layer 6 and the copper 12 are subjected to molten tin 14 which simultaneously acts to dissolve the exposed parts of the gold layer 6 and to form an electrically conductive coating on the copper 12 . The process enables the formation of a precise conduc tive pattern with enhanced reliability.
