# Method for preparing an oxidation catalyst containing a molybdate anion.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a catalyst comprises combining in an aqueous solution, an acid or salt of molybdenum with a water soluble acid or non metallic salt of silicon, phosphorus or arsenic, which is capable of forming a polyhedra of molyb denum. An aqueous chloride ion and a compound of phos photungstate, silicotungstate, vanadium arsenate, silicoarse nate, phosphovanadate, silicovanadate or corresponding acids thereof or mixtures thereof are then added to the mix ture. The resulting combination is dried and calcined to yield the finished catalyst. The oxidation catalyst has the following empirical for mula Y
