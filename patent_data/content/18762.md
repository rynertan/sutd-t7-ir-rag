# Thermal printing apparatus.

## Abstract
A dot matrix thermal printing apparatus comprises a plurality of thermal elements H aligned on a straight line in a direction perpendicular to the direction of feeding of a thermal paper P . Each thermal element is selectively energised by a power pulse according to the desired pattern to be printed, and the pulse width of the power pulse which is applied to each thermal element is controlled according to the speed of feeding the thermal paper and or the status black white of the previously printed several dots so that a desired concentration or colour density is obtained. A digital memory 10 stores the status of the previously printed dots or the duration between the time that the last black dot was printed and the present time, and defines a trigger pulse for initiating the power pulse for each thermal element. Hence, the thermal paper is always heated to a proper temperature to provide the desired print concentration in spite of changes in the speed of feeding of the thermal paper and or the status of the previously printed dots.
