# Temperature compensation circuit for strain gauges.

## Abstract
A temperature compensation circuit for strain gauges fixed to an object to be measured and adapted to take out an output conforming to a strain by being fed with a constant voltage, wherein a compensation resistors in the form of a combination of two or more kinds of resistors each made of a pure single metal material having a resistance versus temperature characteristic equivalent to the output voltage versus temperature characteristic of the bridge circuit of strain gauges are inserted and connected at a predetermined position on the voltage supply side or output take out side of the bridge circuit of strain gauges thereby compensating for variations in the strain gauge output due to temperature variations with high accuracy. The temperature compensation circuit for strain gauges according to the present invention not only has very high accuracy of temperature compensation but also can be produced with high yield.
