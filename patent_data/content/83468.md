# Accumulation conveyor.

## Abstract
An accumulation conveyor has the drive from a longitudi nal drive shaft 3 passed to a conveyor element 2 by means of a driving wheel 4 , preferanly a bevel gear 4a , engaging a contact surface, preferably an annular gear 5a of a driven wheel 5b in driving contact with the conveyor element 2 . The contact surface is provided with one or more gaps 6, 6a which enable the drive transmission to be regularly interrupted and restored, so that on accumulation, the transmission only needs to slip until the gap 6, 6a reaches the wheel 4, 4a when the driven wheel 5, 5b will stop.

## Description
This invention relates to accumulation conveyors used for transporting articles and packages, e.g.in factories. Such conveyors are often driven roller conveyors which consist of a basic framework extending along the required transport route and carrying transverse rollers over which the articles are passed In a driven roller conveyor, the rollers are powered, usually from a main power unit located at one end of the conveyor. Many different methods have been used to drive the rollers and the most common system systems use a recirculating longitudinal belt or chain drive arranged to turn at least some of the rollers. The number of rollers which are driven is usually varied depending on the power required. One big problem with driven roller conveyors concerns the interruption of the drive when articles on the conveyor begin to accumulate, e.g. if there is a blockage or if too many are being supplied to a particular handling area. One system which has achieved considerable success uses a longitudinal drive shaft extending along one side of the conveyor. On this shaft are mounted spindles which are relatively loose friction fit on the shaft.These spindles are connected to rollers which are to be driven by endless belts under tension, each belt passing through a half turn before passing over the end of the roller, so that the drive is transmitted in a direction perpendicular to that of the shaft. Such a system is commercially available under the Trade Name Poweroll . In such a system, an accumulation of goods on the conveyor prevents the rollers from turning and the small increased load on the spindles causes them to slip on the drive shaft. The drive to the rollers is thus governed by torque a slight increase in torque leading to interruption of the drive. This system relies on slippage of the spindles, which inevitably leads to wear and noise, and the wear in turn leads to inefficient transmission of power to the rollers The present invention is also applicable to other type of conveyors, such as overhead conveyors in which carriers are in rolling contact with upper surfaces of the drive wheels and suspended from them. I have now devised a simple transmission system which enables the power to be disengaged from from conveying elements on which an article has become stationary because of accumulation on the conveyor, which system does not depend on slippage under increased torque. This transmission system isolates the roller from the drive shaft almost instantaneously and as no lippage is involved the system is comparatively silent and free from wear. According to the present invention there is provided an accumulation conveyor comprising a series of conveying elements at least some of which are driven by a longitudinal drive shaft, characterised in that drive is transmitted to a conveyor element by a transmission system comprising a driving wheel rotatable with the drive shaft and one or more driven wheels rotatable about transverse axes and drivingly connected with the conveying elements arranged and constructed so that the drive supplied to the conveying element is regularly interrupted and is restored by movement of the conveying element. In general, the regular interruption is achieved by interrupting a contact surface on a driven wheel at one point or at two or more points spaced radially from each other so that when the interrupted portion faces the contacting wheel, contact is, at that point, broken. In one preferred embodiment, the driving wheel rotatable with the drive shaft is arranged so that its driving surface can contact a face of a drive wheel mounted with its axis perpendicular to that of the drive shaft, the drive wheel being provided with a recess in the area contacted by the primary drive wheel, whereby driving contact with the primary drive wheel is interrupted at the point when the intermediate drive wheel is rotated so that the recess faces the drive wheel. The above mentioned embodiments generally relate to transmissions in which the drive is by friction, the wheels rotating against one another under a certain pressure which is either provided by the natural resilience of the material, or is alternatively supplied by the spring bias on the wheel mounting. In either situation the bias must be such that when the recess or flat on a driven wheel faces the contacting driving wheel, contact is indeed broken. Obviously too much resilience would mean that the driving wheel might contact the recessed part of the surface and so still transmit power. In an alternative preferred system, the wheels may be toothed, e.g in the manner of a bevel gear. In this case, the interruption can constitute one or more shorter teeth, or even a local absence of teeth. The drive interruption is achieved as follows.Under normal running circumstances of a driven roller conveyor, with no accumulation of goods on the conveyor, the momentum of an article on the conveyor and also the drive supplied to it by rollers at the rear, ensures that a driven roller at the front of the article is rotated into re engagement of the driving wheels.Thus, as soon as drive is disengaged by the recess rotating to face the driving wheel, the recessed or flatted wheel is urged passed this position by the article and drive is reconnected. As soon as there is an accumulation of goods on the conveyor, a package will stop and there will then be no momentum acting on the rollers to reconnect the drive once it has been interrupted. Thus, as soon as the passage of an article along the conveyor is impeded, the power supplied to the rollers on which it stands is interrupted. A similar chain of events applies, mutatis mutandis, to an overhead conveyor. Once the accumulation on the conveyor has been cleared, drive can be reconnected simply by giving the stationary carries a package a slight push sufficient to turn the rollers and re engage the driven wheels.This push may be manual or may be supplied by following carriers or packages. Alternatively, a manually operated device may be provided to give an impulse to a driven wheel. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 represents a partial plan view of a drum roller conveyor seen from below Figure 2 represents a partial side view along the line A A Figure 3 represents an oblique view of the driven wheel Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 2 showing an alternative arrangement, Figure 5 is a longitudinal section of part of an overhead conveyor in accordance with a preferred form of the present invention Figure 6 is a section on the line VI VI ofFigure 1 and Figure 7 is a plan view with carriers omitted. In the arrangement shown in figures 1 to 3, the conveyor comprises a longitudinal frame 1 carrying a plurality of conveying element in the form of transverse rollers 2 and a longitudinally extending drive shaft 3. Under the rollers intended to be driven, there are located on the drive shaft 3, driving wheels 4. The driving wheels 4 are arranged to be rotated sdlidly with the drive shaft 3 and to transmit their rotation to driven wheels 5 which in turn contact the rollers 2 and turn them. Referring specifically to Figure 3, each driven wheel 5 is provided on one face with a recess 6 such that the driving wheel 4 will rotate the driven wheel 5 until the recess 6 faces it, whereupon contact between the driving wheel 4 and the driven wheel 5 is lost, but is regained on slight rotation of the roller 2. Conveniently, the drive wheels 4 are formed from a resilient material such as synthetic rubber and the driven wheels 5 are formed from a suitably hardwearing rigid material, e.g. a plastics material such as nylon In operation the drive shaft 3 rotates about its axis, thus causing the drive wheels 4 to contact the driven wheels 5 and rotate them, At each point where the drive wheel 4 comes to face the recess 6 in the driven wheel 5, contact is interrupted, but further rotation of the driven wheel 5, by virtue of inertia in the motion of a package over the rollers 2, moves the recess 6 passed the drive wheel 4 so that contact is restored. If the roller 2 is in contact with and restrained by a stationary item then the drive will slip until interruption of the drive by the recess 6, when the drive wheel will stop. If there is no movement of the article over the rollers 2, then drive is not restored until the article is urged along the conveyor. In the alternative, and now preferred form of the invention illustrated in Figure 4, the friction drive between the driving wheel 4 and drive wheel 5 is replaced by a driving bevel gear 4a on the drive shaft 3 and in mesh with an annular gear 5a on driven wheel 5b. The annular gear 5a is interrupted at 6a to provide the interrupted drive. By using a gear drive between the driving and driven wheels 4a and 5b, slippage between these wheels is prevented so that any slippage occurring before the interruption of the drive must be between the drive wheel 5b and the roller. This means that interruption is achieved with minimum delay and therefore minimum wear and noise. If required, a restart of the drive may be achieved by means of a stroking device engaging directly on the gear 5a and manually operated to provide an impulse to engage normal drive by moving the gap 6a clear of the bevel gear 4a. As shown in the arrangement of figures 5 to 7, drawings, a generally U shaped conveyor track 11 of indefinite length has a longitudinal drive shaft 12 supported therein by bearings not shown . At regular spaced intervals along the drive shaft are driving bevel gears 13a and 13b solid with the shaft 12. Each bevel gear 13a or 13b engaged a matching interrupted bevel gear 14 mounted on the face of a drive wheel 15a or 15b respectively, rotatably mounted on a transverse shaft 16. The drive wheels 15a are mounted on one side of the track and the drive wheels 15b on the other side.Carriers 17 which do the actual conveying are suspended from drive wheels 15a and 15b and have flat surfaces 18 in rolling contact with the upper surface of the drive wheels 15a and 15b so as to be driven along the track by them. Each carrier 17 is shown as having a pair of guide rollers 19 mounted for rotation about vertical axes and in engagement with the outer surfaces of the stationary track 11. As can be seen, the interrupted bevel gears 14 provide continuous interruption and re connection with the transmission of drive from the shaft 2 to the drive wheels 15a and 15b via the gears 13a and 13b so that if a carrier is impeded by an accumulation of goods, the drive wheels 15a and 15b only have to slip against the carriers until the arrival of the interruption at coincidence with the bevel gear 13a and 13b. The drive is then interrupted and slippage ceases. When the carrier is once more free to move, it can be nudged forward to reconnect drive. Such nudging may either be manual or from a succeeding carrier. Alternatively, an impulse can be given to the wheel 14 by some other external device. Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. For instance where accumulation is not expected at certain sections of a conveyor, then the drive transmission at these points may be without the interruption feature. Also, some parts of a conveyor system not requiring the accumulation feature may incorporate a drive by rack and pinion, e.g. between a pinion formed on the rim of the wheels 15a and 15b and a rack provided on the carrier. This will provide a more positive, nonaccumulative, drive for inclined sections, either ascending or descending. Also, when a conveyor, or length of conveyor, has to include a bend, use may be made of a flexible shaft, e.g. of nylon, as the drive shaft.
