# SPACE TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
The temperature control system controls the tempera ture of a space inside say a building at different levels over a period of time, the system comprising a space temperature sensor 11,13 , a unit 12 heating or cooling the space, and a controller 14,15 responsive to the sensor and to a real time clock 17 to determine optimum start and or stop times for the unit, the controller including means adjusting the start and or stop times based upon the sensed previous deviation between desired and actual times that the space reached a desired level.
