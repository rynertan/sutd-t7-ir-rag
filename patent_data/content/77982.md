# An electrolysis process and electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrolysis process which is characte rized by carrying out the electrolysis of an aqueous alkali metal halide solution while supplying a cathode liquor into a cathode compartment 2 formed between a cation exchange membrane 3 positioned substantially horizontal and a cathode plate 16 of gas liquid impermeability, with which the membrane 3 is wetted, than a mixed stream of the cathode liquor and cathode gas being removed from the cathode compartment 2 . Also disclosed is an electrolytic cell which is comprised of an upper anode compartment 1 and a lower cathode compartment 2 partitioned by a cation exchange membrane 3 positioned substantially horizontal, said anode compartment 1 having therein substantially horizontal anodes 12 and an anolyte solution inlet 13 and outlet 14 , and said cathode compartment 2 having a cathode plate 16 with gas liquid impermeability and a cathode liquor inlet 19 and an outlet 20 of a mixed stream of the cathode liquor and cathode gas.
