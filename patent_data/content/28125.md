# Plastic container with a generally hemispherical bottom wall having hollow legs projecting therefrom.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to improvements in the cross sec tion of a bottom end of a plastic bottle suitable for packaging li quids under internal pressures. The bottom end is primarily one which includes a generally hemispherical bottom wall hav ing projecting therefrom in circumferentially spaced relation hollow iegs 23 terminating in supporting feet 25 . The bot tom end is stiffened against creep of the plastic material over a period of time under the influence of the internal pressure by changing the configuration of the bottom wall from that of a hemisphere to one which includes a configuration of straight line sections 32 and curved line sections 31 when viewed in radial cross section along the axis of the bottle.
