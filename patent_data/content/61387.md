# LOGIC GATE STRUCTURE USING SPACE CHARGE LIMITED TRANSISTORS

## Abstract
An intregrated circuit structure is disclosed in which a pair of complementary lateral space charge limited transis tors are formed together with at least one Schottky diode to create a logic gate. The structure includes a semiconductor substrate, a first and a second region of N conductivity type spaced apart in the substrate, a third and a fourth region of P conductivity type, the third region separating the first region from the second region, and the second region separating the third region from the fourth region. The first region has a graduated impurity concentration which is less than 10¹⁸ atoms per cubic centimeter at the surface and at least 10¹⁸ atoms per cubic centimeter at a selected depth below the surface of the substrate.
