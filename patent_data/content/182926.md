Referring now to FIGS. 7 to 18, there is illustrated an alternate embodiment of the self sufficient incubation assembly of the present invention, embodied in the manner taught in detail below, as a self sufficient urinary tract infection kit for indicating the presence of a Gram negative infection, a Gram positive infection, or the absence of both. As further known to those skilled in the incubator art, in prior art incubators neither the culture media nor the receptacle for receiving the media, such as a cuvette, is in intimate contact with either the heating element or themeansfor optical or electro optical viewing of the microorganism cultivation such lack of intimacy inherently introducing unwanted loss and distortion into the apparatus.Further, prior art incubators including computation means for computing microorganism cultivation, locate the computation means and the electrical circuitry in which the computation means is embodied outside the area of the incubator where the cuvette or other culture media receptacle is located whereby the heat of operation generated by such circuitry is dissipated and not utilized in the process of culture media heating and microorganism cultivation. Thus, where the incubator is energized by a battery, such as for home use, the dissipation of such heat can be significant because the battery must be sufficiently large, with its attendant expense, to. provide the entire energy required for bacterial incubation or cultivation.and operation of the external circuitry. Generally, the alternate self sufficient incubation assembly of the present invention utilizes an electro optical methodology of transilluminating a bacteria seeded liquid culture medium by means of a light emitter and detector of a photometer which over a given period of time measures or computes the bacterial growth or proliferation by measuring or computing the increase in optical density of the liquid culture medium due to bacterial proliferatian, such increase in optical density causing a decrease in the intensity of the transluminating light beam or ray passing through the liquid culture medium.Further, generally, this is accomplished by the utilization of a transparent cuvette which has attached to its base and in intimate thermal and optical contact with it, a hybrid circuit including a monolithic chip which provides the computation means for evaluating the electro optical output of the emitter and detector pairing necessary to snake the electro optical measurement three light emitting diodes which in cooperation with the computation means on the chip are illuminated in response to a pre programmed algorithm, also embodied on the chip, to indicate bacterial proliferation, namely to indicate the presence of a Gram positive urinary tract infection, a Gram negative infection, or the absence of both. Referring now specifically to FIGS. 7 11, and initially to FIG. 8, there is shown an alternate embodiment of selfsufficient incubation assembly of the present invention indicated by general numerical designation 100. The assembly includes a bottom 101 and a top 102, which are essentially shell like structures, assembled together and provided with required structural rigidity by telescopically interconnecting posts 103 and 104, and posts 105 and 106 posts 103 and 104 being best seen in FIG. 8 and posts 105 and 106 being shown only inFIG. 9 for clarity of invention illustration.The assembly 100 further includes a transparent cuvette 110 providing a first cell ill and a second cell 112, each cell for receiving a portion of a seeded liquid culture growth medium such as eugonic broth seeded with a urine sample from a urinary tract suspected of having a urinary tract infection such as a Gram negative orGram positive infection.

As is further known to those skilled in the art, bacteria can be classified into tWo groups, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. As is further known to those skilled in the art, urinary tract infection is caused primarily by Gram negative bacteria such as Ecoli however, as is also known, urinary tract infection can be caused by Gram positive bacteria.While virtually all sampled urine contains some bacteria, the levels of bacteria of concern are those levels which are referred in the art as clinically relevant levels of bacteria, for example 100,000 bacteria per ml, and it is the early detection of the presence of such clinically significant levels of bacteria that is the purpose of urinary tract infection detection apparatus in order that appropriate antibiotics can be prescribed and taken before the onset of a virulent bacterial infection. As is further known to those skilled in the art, Gram negative bacteria reproduce faster than Gram positive bacteria,Gram negative bacteria reproducing approximately every 20 minutes while Gram positive bacteria reproduce approximately every 40 minutes, that is at approximately one half the rate of Gram negative bacteria. Hence, with this reproduction information, bacteria in a urine sample from a urinary tract suspected of having an infection may be cultivated at a physiological temperature, such as for example 370C or 98.60F, for a given period of time such as for example approximately four hours, and the bacteria level present at the beginning of the period per ml may be compared with the bacteria present per ml at the end of the period and the presence or absence of a clinically significant level of bacteria can be determined. In addition, by knowing the respective reproduction rates of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, and by comparing the respective growths of such bacteria over the time interval, the logical determination of the presence of a Gram negative infection or of a Gram positive infection can also be determined or clinically inferred. As is further known to those skilled in the art, the growth of bacteria in a sample, such as a seeded liquid culture growth medium, over a given period of time can be determined or measured by the use of a photometer such as a turbidity meter.At the beginning of the time interval, the optical density of the sample can be measured by passing a transluminating beam or ray of light through the sample and the energy loss due to light scattering of the beam can be measured and recorded.Bacteria, as is known, upon growth or reproduction scatters light and as bacteria in the sample reproduce or proliferate such as in response to cultivation, more light is scattered there by further increasing the optical density of the sample and hence at the end of the time interval the transluminating beam or ray can again be passed through the sample and the increased energy loss caused by increased optical density or light scattering can again be measured and compared vis a vis the earlier measurement. The difference. in energy level of the light beam can be used, empirically, and particularly knowing the reproduction rate of the bacteria present, to provide a measurement of bacteria growth in the sample over the time interval.It will be further understood that circuitry embodied in the monolithic chip 132 and the photoemitter and photodetector pairsEl Dl and E2 D2, in combination with the collimating and collecting lens and reflectors of the transparent cuvette 110 function as a photometer or turbidity meter. Referring now specifically to the operation of the present invention when embodied as a urinary tract infection kit, it will be presumed that a urine sample has been taken from a urinary tract suspected of having a urinary tract infection, that the urine sample has been diluted in a suitable liquid culture growth medium, such as eugonic broth, to seed the broth, that the cap 150 of the assembly 100 has been removed, and that the seeded liquid culture growth medium has been poured into the receptacle 200 where it flows through the two funnels 201, 202 where it substantially divides and enters into the cells.111 and 112 of the transparent cuvette 110. It will be understood that cell 111 has been preconditioned to grow onlyGram positive bacteria by having a Gram negative inhibitor placed therein such as by coating the walls of cell 111 with sodium azide powder which, as known to those skilled in the art, inhibits the growth of virtually all Gram negative bacteria.However, cell 112 has not been so preconditioned and hence both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria will grow in cell 112. The cap 150 will then be placed into the receptacle 200 with the arrows 119 and 159 aligned to initiate operation of the assembly by energization of the electrical circuit 130 as taught above. It will be understood that the monolithic chip 132 of the electrical circuitry 130, FIG. 16, may have a suitable circuit embodied therein to cause all of the photoemitters E3, E4 and E5 to be temporarily activated, or activated in a predetermined sequence, to provide indication to the user that the self sufficient incubation assembly is functioning thereafter such photoemitters will be extinguished and bacteria cultivation commenced and continued for a time interval. As is further known to those skilled in the art, to provide significant turbidity measurements at the beginning and end of the time interval, the photometer or turbidity meter must be baselined to provide appropriate measurement references against which future measurements may be measured or compared for significant results. Accordingly, the electrical circuitry 130 of the present invention, in accordance with the following further teachings, may be suitably baselined for significant measurements. Referring to FIG. 15, there is shown such baselining circuitry, indicated by general numerical designation 220, which may be used in accordance with the teachings of the present invention and which baselining circuitry, although illustrated as a block diagram in FIG. 15, will be embodied in the monolithic chip 132 of FIG. 16 in a manner known to those skilled in the art.The baselining circuitry 220 is a dual channel circuit including channel 230 associated with cuvette cell 111 and channel 240 associated with cuvette cell 112.Channel 230 includes the series connection of the photoemitterEl, photodetector D2, amplifier Al, switching network S1, threshold comparator T1, start stop logic 232, counter 234, digital to analog converter 236 and amplifier A2 similarly, the channel 240 includes the series connected components as shown. Additionally, the baselining circuit includes the threshold comparators T3 and T4 connected to the decoder 250 which in turn is provided with three outputs as shown, for providing one of three binary outputs indicative of the bacterial conditions shown, namely no infection, Gram negative infection, or Gram positive infection. Continuing from above, it will again be presumed that the circuitry 130 has been energized by the battery 144 due to the closure of the cap 150 and now the operation of the baselining circuitry 220 and the decoder 250 for providing the bacterial infection indication shown will be described. With regard to baselining channel 230, upon energization the switching network SW1 assumes state S1 whereupon photoenitter El has no output and hence photodetector D1 has no input and therefore no output this lack oE output will be reflected to amplifier Al and threshold comparator T1 will signal the start stop logic 232 to initiate counting which is then converted, digital to analog by the converter 236, boosted by amplifier A2, and reflected in a gradually increasing light level emanating from the photoemitter El. At such time the evoked response of the photodetector D1 reaches the preset level of threshold detectorT1, the start stop logic is signalled to stop counting thus freezing the output level of the photoemitter El and channel 230 is now baselined similarly, channel 240 is also baselined to the preset level of threshold detector T2.At the conclusion of the cultivation time interval, for example approximately four hours, which time elapse is built into the circuitry of the monolithic chip 132 in a manner known to those skilled in the art, the switching network SW1 assumes state S2 and the evoked response of the photodetector D1 in response to the output of the photemitter El transluminating the cuvette cell 111 is connected through amplifier Al to threshold comparator T3 and compared with its preset threshold level and if the later evoked response of the photodetector D1 falls below the threshold of threshold comparator T3 a binary 0 signal is transmitted to the decoder 250 to indicate the absence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 111. However, if the evoked response of the photodetector D1 is at least equal to or greater than the preset threshold of threshold comparator D3, a binary 1 signal is transmitted to the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 111. Similarly, threshold comparator T4 is preset to send a binary 0 or 1 signal to the decoder 250 to respectively indicate the absence of clinical significant levels of Gram negative and or Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 112 or the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative and or Gram positive bacterial growth i ceIl rl . It will be understood that the preset threshold levels of the respective threshold comparators will be preset empirically and in accordance with the recognized respective reproduction and growth rates of gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, for example the preset threshold of threshold comparator T4 of channel 240 will be approximately twice the preset level of threshold comparator T3 of channel 230 since it is known that Gram negative bacteria grow at approximately twice the rate of Gram positive bacteria. The decoder 250, will interpret or decode the binary 1 or 0 signals received from the respective threshold comparators T3 and T4 to provide an indication of bacterial growth in acc√∂rdandG with the algorithm, sometimes referred to in the art as a truth table, set forth in FIG. 17.It will be further understood that the algorithm or truthtable of FIG. 17 will also be embodied in suitable circuitry included in the monolithic chip 12.of the electrical circuit 130. Referring now to the decoder algorithm of FIG. 17, upon the decoder 250 of FIG. 15 receiving the binary 1 from the output of cell 111 and a binary 0 from the output of cell 112, this will be interpreted and the appropriate photoemitter E4 illuminated to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels ofGram positive bacteria in the urine sample. Upon the decoder receiving a binary 0 from cell 111 and a binary 1 from cell 112, this will be interpreted by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative bacteria and photoemitter E4 will be illuminated to provide such indication. Should a binary 0 be received from both cells, this will be decoded to indicate the absence of any clinically significant infection and photoemitter E3 will be illuminated to provide such visual indication.However, it is possible for the decoder to receive a binary 1 from both cell 111 and cell 112 and, as indicated in FIG. 17, this is interpreted or decoded by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram positive bacteria. This results from one of two possible situations and the following logic one possibility is that Gram positive bacteria were present in such large quantity or experienced such large growth during cultivation as to exceed both the preset threshold level of threshold comparator T3 of the Gram positive cell 111 and the preset threshold level of the threshold comparator T4 of theGram positive and or Gram negative bacteria cell 112 the other possibility is that there were mixed bacteria present, indicating the possibility of a mixed infection, and that the growth of the Gram positive bacteria in cell 112 exceeded the threshold of threshold comparator T3 and that there was either mixed orGram negative bacteria growth in cell 112 sufficient to exceed the preset threshold of threshold comparator T4. In such event, as known to those skilled in the art, treatment for Gram positive bacteria or Gram positive infection is indicated. It will be noted from FIGS. 8, 10 and 11, and from FIG. 16 where cuvette 110, cell 111 and cell 112 are shown in dahsed outline, and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that the electrical circuitry 130 and the temperature control element 135 are in intimate physical contact with the cuvette 110 specifically the underside thereof.Hence, the temperature of the temperature control element 135 will be substantially the same as the temperature of the cuvette and the seeded culture growth medium contained therein whereby improved temperature control of the medium is provided, and the heat of operation of the electrical circuitry 130 will supplement the heat applied by the heating resistor 133 and battery 144 to the cuvettell0 and the seeded culture growth mcdi itm received therein whereby the energy required to be supplied by the battery 144 will be less than would be required were the electrical circuitry 130 to be located externally of the cuvette and not in intimate physical contact therewith. Identically, in the earlier embodiment of FIGS. 1 6, since the electrical circuitry 72 and the temperature control thermistor included therein are in intimate physical contact with the culture growth dish assembly 60 as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, specifically the underside thereof, the improved temperature control of the nutrient agar cell is also provided and the heat of operation of the electrical circuitry 72 also supplements the heating of the agar cell by the battery 36. Referring again to FIG. 16,,it will be understood that the photoemitter El of FIG. 16 is positioned at the proper point along the optical axis of the collimating lens 181 of the cuvette 110 to maximize collimation of the light emitted by the photodetector for transluminating the culture growth medium received by cuvette cell 111 and the photodetector D1 of FIG. 16 is positioned along the optical axis of the collecting lens 183 to maximize the collection of the light transluminating the culture growth medium and exiting the cuvette 110 for photometric easuret. I will be be further understood by those skilled in the art that zany modifications and variations of the present inventio may be made without departing from the spirit and the scope thereof
