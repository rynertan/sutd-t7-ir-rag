# Purification of nitrogen trifluoride atmospheres.

## Abstract
A process for purifying nitrogen trifiuoride atmospheres contaminated with nitrous oxide and dinitrogen difluoride. The improvement resides in reducing the dinitrogen dif luoride content in the atmosphere to less than 0.05 by vol ume prior to passing the atmosphere through a molecular sieve which adsorbs the nitrous oxide and any remaining dinitrogen difluoride.
