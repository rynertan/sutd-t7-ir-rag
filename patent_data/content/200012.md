# Process for producing aromatic polyester fiber.

## Abstract
In a process for producing an aromatic polyester fiber by heat treating a fiber obtained by melt spinning an aromatic polyester exhibiting anisotropy in its molten state, an aromatic polyester fiber having high strength and high modulus of elasticity can be produced with suppressed fusion between single filaments during the heat treatment by a subjecting the fiber obtained by melt spinning to heat treatment in an organic liquid heating medium or b adhering to the fiber obtained by melt spinning at least one member selected from the group consisting of solutions of a basic compound having a concentration of 0.2 to 20 by weight, suspensions of the same having the same concentra tion, organic polymer powders having a melting point or a softening temperature not lower than the heat treatment temperature, barium sulfate powder, and barium titanate powder, and then subjecting the resulting fiber to heat treatment.
