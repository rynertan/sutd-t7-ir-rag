## Description
This invention relates to a solid state image sensor particularly, but not necessarily exclusively, an interline CCD image sensor i.e., an interline charge coupled device image sensor. Although solid state image sensors are advantageous over pick up tubes in compactness, minimization of weight, durability, reliability, exhibiting no burn in from intense overloads, etc., they give rise to blooming and smear which do not arise in pick up tubes. Blooming occurs when excess signal charges in the photodiode overflow into the transfer channel, resulting in distinct white lines on the obtained image, while smear takes place when a signal charge generated deep inside the substrate diffuses into the transfer channel, resulting in indistinct white lines on the obtained image. Blooming can be eliminated by means of overflow drains composed of an n diffusion layer which absorbs excess charges, as disclosed by W.F. Kosonocky et al., Control of Blooming in Charge Coupled Imagers , RCA Review, vol. 35, pp 3 24, March 1974. However, the problem of smear has not yet been solved. The above mentioned approach for the elimination of blooming sacrifices photosensitivity and dynamic range because the active area is reduced, and accordingly a method for the transfer of the excess charges into the substrate has been proposed by Y. Ishihara et al., Interline CCD Image Sensor with an Antiblooming Structure , IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, vol. ED 31, No. 1, January 1984. Figure A reverse bias voltage is applied between the channel stops The pulses As the photogenerated signal charge accumulates in the n type layer 14, the potential of the n type layer 14 decreases. However, the excess charges generated in the n type layer 14 when it receives intense illumination are transferred from the n type layer 14 into the n type substrate 1 through the thin p type layer 12 which has been depleted, resulting in a suppression of blooming. The prior art image sensor shown in Figure 3 can therefore suppress blooming, but it still has the following serious problems The first problem is that the image sensor cannot be made compact because of the inevitable lateral expansion of the thick p type layer 13. The size of the unit cell cannot be minimized beyond a certain extent in the lateral direction because the size of the thin p layer 12 is essential to a certain extent. The second problem is that smear takes place unavoidably when a signal charge generated in the non depleted thick p type layer 13 diffuses into the vertical CCD register and mixes with the signal charge in it. An image sensor of the above mentioned type which suppresses unwanted lateral diffusion of carriers by complete depletion of the p type layer not only below the photodiode area but also below the vertical CCD register area is shown in the earlier priority EP A 0 174 133, which was published after the priority date of this application. This document does however not provide a photodiode area consisting of two different layers. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a solid state image sensor having a plurality of unit cells, each of which comprises a photodiode area in which, in operation, signal charges accumulate, and a CCD register area for receiving and transferring the signal charges generated in the photodiode area, The upper layer of the photodiode area may be of either the first or the second conductivity type, and it may, in a preferred embodiment, be formed by a self alignment technique using an electrode of the CCD register as a mask. Depletion is, according to the invention, attained not only in that region of said first layer which lies between the substrate and the photosensitive area but also in the region between the substrate and the CCD register, by the application of a reverse bias voltage between the substrate and the layer which is formed on the substrate. The CCD register, in a preferred embodiment, comprises a buried channel. In this case the lower region of the photosensitive area, facing the substrate, can be formed simultaneously with the buried channel of the CCD register according to another aspect of the present invention. Thus, an embodiment of the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a solid state image sensor which can attain a suppression of not only blooming but also smear and 2 providing a solid state image sensor having a compact structure. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how it may be put into effect reference will now be made by way of example to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 2 is a sectional view showing a unit cell of a second embodiment of a solid state image sensor of this invention. Figure 3 is a sectional view showing a conventional unit cell of an interline CCD image sensor. Figure 1 shows a unit cell of an interline CCD image sensor in accordance with this invention, which comprises an n type substrate 21, a first, p type, layer 22 formed on the n type substrate 21, a vertical CCD register which comprises a buried channel constituted by an n layer 23 formed on the p type layer 22, and a photosensitive area which contains a p n junction photodiode including an n layer 24 and an n layer 25. The n layer 24 is positioned in the region below the surface of the photosensitive area, nearest the n type substrate 21, while the n layer 25 is positioned on the upper surface of the photosensitive area. Since the n layer 25 can be formed by a self alignment technique using a polysilicon electrode 29 for the CCD register as a mask, it does not complicate the production process of this image sensor. Moreover, since the n layer 24 can be formed at the same time as the n layer 23 constituting the buried channel of the CCD, it allows for further simplification of production processes for this image sensor. A transfer gate region A reverse bias voltage is applied between the channel stop The introduction of the pulses Figure As mentioned above, each of the unit cells of the image sensor is designed in a manner to form both the buried channel CCD register of the n layer constituting the transfer area and the photodiode constituting the photosensitive area on the same p type layer disposed on the n type substrate, so that excess charges generated in the photodiode receiving intense illumination can be transferred from the photodiode into the n type substrate through the depleted region of the p type layer therebetween, resulting in a suppression of blooming. Moreover, since the region of the p type layer positioned between the CCD register and the n type substrate is also depleted, charges generated deep inside the depleted region of the p type layer do not diffuse into the CCD register, resulting in a suppression of smear. Since the image sensor has only one p type layer 22, on which both the CCD register and the photodiode are formed, and does not have a thick p type layer 13, of considerable lateral extent, as in the conventional image sensor in Figure 3, it can be made compact, whereas the conventional image sensor cannot be made compact because of the transverse extent of the said thick p type layer 13.
