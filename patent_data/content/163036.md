# Method and apparatus for sensing relative movement between members.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for sensing relative movement between a pair of members includes a pair of parts which cooperate to provide an electrical signal upon relative movement between the members. One of these parts may be a Hall effect device 42 and the other part may be a pair of magnets 46, 48 . In order to accurately position the Hall effect device 42 and the magnets 46, 48 relative to each, they are mounted on a substrate 38 or base. The portion of the substrate upon which the magnets are disposed is connected with one of the members 30 . The Hall effect device 42 is disposed on a portion of the substrate which is connected with the other member 28 . Once the substrate has been connected with the two members, it is separated to enable the members to be easily moved relative to each other.
