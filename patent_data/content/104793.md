## Description
APPARATUS FOR EQUINE LIMB TREATMENTBackground of the Invention The invention relates to an electromagnetic body treatment device for surgically noninvasive modification of the growth, repair and maintenance behaviour of living tissues and or cells within an equine or the like limb, by a specific and selective change in electrical environment. Applicable background is discussed at length in Ryaby, et al., U.S. PatentNo. 4,105,017 and in various patents having a continuation in part relation thereto.Reference is therefore made to said patents for background discussion. It suffices to note that, although said patents speak generally in the context of controlled modification of cellular and or tissue growth, the primary emphasis on osteogenic applications to human beings, was initially limited to such Hopeless cases as pseudarthroses and other non unions. Devices used on human beings for osteogenic growth and repair have followed the teachings of Ryaby, et al., Patent No. 4,266,532, particularly the embodiment of Fig. 7 of said patent, wherein two electrical coils are positioned on opposite sides of a fracture and are excited in flux aiding relation to develop a substantially uniform zone of magnetic flux concentration in which the afflicted body region is immersed.The power source of pulse excitation signals to the coils is external and bulky, and the signals have followed magnitude and other parameter limitations, based n limitations having FDA approval. In an attempt to apply human being experience to horses, an immediate problem is encountered in that a horse will not willingly permit attempted treatment with a device which can be kicked or destroyed or which requires connection to an external power source. BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide improved applicator means, removably adapted for the pulsed electromagnetically stimulated treatment of a limb related injury of the character indicated. It is a specific object to provide a completely self contained device of the character indicated which can be applied to an equine limb, which is of negligible weight and inconvenience to the animal and which may therefore be left in place on the afflicted limb, with selective availability of the control of treatment in relation to non treatment intervals within a given day. The invention achieves the foregoing objects in a device employing two coils and attachment structure generally as described in said PatentNo. 4,226,532, but containing its own source of power and pulse generating circuitry, and involving pulse signal energy levels that are well below those in current human application and below those set forth in said patent in addition, certain other signal parameters depart from values and value ranges previously set forth.The device is light in weight and of little bulk and is easily tolerated by the animal, and its therapeutic benefits are achieved while the animal is ambulatory. Impressive results are achieved in aid of rapid recovery by horses, particularly race horses, from the kinds of bone and bone related injury variously known as saucer fractures, damaged suspensories, splints and bucks and non bone afflictions such as bowed tendons have been successfully and rapidly treated. Additionally, the injured animal need no longer be subjected to the pain of blistering chemical burning or firing red hot pin insertion through the skin , nor need he be subjected to the long recovery period or curtailed career in the case of t race horse , which have hitherto been accepted as necessary consequences of injuries of the character indicated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention will be described for an illustrative embodiment in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a simplified view in perspective showing a device of the invention applied to the lower region of an injured equine metacarpus Fig. 2 is an enlarged plan view of the device of Fig. 1, prior to assembly to a body limb and as viewed from the outside aspect, i.e., the aspect which, after application to a limb, will be from the outside, looking in Fig. 3 is a sectional view, taken at 3 3 in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 is a simplified diagram, on a reduced scale, showing one assembled portion of the device of Fig. 1, as viewed from the inside aspect i.e., opposite to the aspect of Fig. 2 , to illustrate features of selective adaptation to various sizes of afflicted limb. In Fig. 1, the device of the invention is shown in application to the lower region of a horse s metacarpus, which illustratively may have suffered one of the above indicated bone injuries. Two electrical coil units 10 11 have been applied in diametrically opposed relation to a bandage wrap 12 around the afflicted region.Each coil unit has a lining 13 of soft cushioning material, as of urethane foam, and a circumferential elastic strap 14 compressionally loads the coil units against bandage 12. An outer bandage wrap 15 assures against loss of the setting of elastic strap 14. The respective coils within units 10 11 are driven by a pulse generator and its power supply, both contained within unit 11, and an externally accessible electrical jack 16 acts as a switch, automatically turning on the pulse generator when jack 16 is removed from its receptacle and automatically switching off the pulse generator when jack 16 is inserted into its receptacle . Also, when jack 16 is removed, the jack receptacle will be understood to provide plug in access for battery recharging voltage to be served to the internal battery, from an external charging source not shown . In Figs. 2 and 3, units 10 and 11 are seen to be of like nature and construction, except for the fact that the power source and pulsesignal generating means are carried only at unit 11. Unit 10 comprises two fitted casing halves 18 19 of suitable plastic material, having telescoping fit of their respective peripheral flanges 18 19 , and secured to each other as by rivets 20 at abutting pedestal formations 21 21 . The telescoped flanges are contour conforming to a multiturn electrical coil 22, shown tape wrapped and nested within the flanges 18 19 . Coil shape is generally elliptical, to a major axis extent which may be approximately twice the minor axis extent. Coil shape is also characterized by generally cylindrically arcuate curvature to a radius of approximately minor axis extent, about a cylinder axis parallel to the major elliptical axis.The fitted casing halves 18 19 conform to and retain these coil curvature characteristics. For convenience, the casing half 18, which is characterized by a concave generally cylindrical outer surface, will be referred to as the inner half, and the casing half 19, having a convex outer surface, will be referred to as the outer half. Electrical leads 23 23 to coil 22 are connected, within the casing 18 19, to conductors of a flexible cable 24. Cable 24 extends between units 10 11 and enters unit 10 via a port formation 25 near.the center of one of the long edges of outer casing half 19, being clamped at 26 to avoid stress on the cable to coil connection. The end of strap 14 which is fixed to unit 10 passes through a slot opening 29 in casing half 19, and is welt reinforced within the casing to assure against loss through the slot. Finally, a large central rectangular piece 27 of detachable coupling fabric, such as a loop fabric of Velcro material, issXsecured to the convex outer surface of casing half 19, fòtn releasable engagement to a piece 28 of coacting hook fabric secured to the free end of strap 14. Those features of unit 11 which are the same as for unit 10 are shown with the same reference numbers. The two casing halves of unit 11 contain and peripherally retain the elliptical shape of the second coil 30 which may be identical with coil 22 and which is shown with its leads 31 31 connected via cable 24 in parallel to those of coil 22.A printed circuit board 32 is contained within the casing of unit 11 and carries pulse generator circuitry having output connection via leads 33 33 to the line of electrically parallel connection of coils 22 30 input power to the pulse generator circuitry is provided by small rechargeable batteries 34, shown as five AA size cells, connected in series and also contained within the casing of unit 11 a protective wrap 39 of bandage or the like fabric material helps retain the assembled relation of battery cells and cushions them against displacement within the casing, and a protective pad 39 of suitably shockabsorbent material protects pulse generator components from direct mechanical shock contact with adjacent casing of unit 11.The external contour of the outer casing half 19 of unit 11 will be seen to include a more pronounced bulge 35, to accommodate self contained battery and circuit components. The bulge has an outwardly projecting rim, surrounding a recessed panel portion 36 overstanding the batteries and a further recessed region 37 where a jack receptacle 38 is mounted for jack 16 reception. Finally, a rectangular piece 40 of loop fabric is secured to the outer convex surface of panel region 36, for selective removably attached engagement to a piece 41 of hook fabric fixed to the middle range of strap 14, and an indicator lamp such as an LED device 42, mounted to the upper side of the rim of bulge 35, provides externally viewable confirmation of whether or not the pulse generator is operating. The Ryaby, et al. patents referred to above describe value ranges for various parameters of applied signals. Generally, the signals found effective for equine treatment involve energy and frequency levels at or below lower limits of ranges specified in said patents. Specifically, for equine applicators of the type herein described, it is found effective to provide asymmetrical pulse excitation of the described coils. In most of the clinical equine work to date, the pulses are of quasi rectangular form, comprising a first pulse portion of relatively low magnitude first polarity and of approximately 250 microsecond effective duration, followed by a second pulse portion of relatively greater magnitude second polarity and of approximately 4 microsecond effective duration.Such pulses are repeated in bursts of 30 milliseconds, but about 4kHz, and the bursts are repeated at a repetition rate of 1.5Hz. The amplitude of excitation signal is such as to develop a maximum body indiced voltage of approximately 0.2 millivolt per centimeter of treated tissue and or cells, as measured by a probe coil of the type described in said Ryaby et al. patents. Stated more generally, present experience indicates that, for the stated pulse signals, the burstrepetition rate should be in the range of 1 to 5Hz, that the pulses within each burst should be in the range of 2 to 5kHz, and that the burst duration should be approximately one fifth to one fiftieth the period of burst repetition. The involved maximum magnetic field strength is approximately 2 Gauss during the first pulse portion.For the described parallel connection of coils 22 30, each coil may suitably comprise 80 turns of 19 AWG enameled copper wire, to an initial diameter of 18 cm, and after winding, each coil is bent to its above described shape. fn use, the installed spacing of units 10 11 on strap 14 will depend upon girth of the afflicted limb region. The removable engagement at 40 on unit ll and at 41 midway along strap 14 enables adjustment of the secured relative position of units 10 11 until their desired diametrically opposed relation has been established, whereupon the remaining free end of strap 14 may be tensed to the desired degree before anchoring the free end hook material to the loop material on the outer panel 36 of unit 11. Use of the described invention appears likely to revolutionize the repair therapy of bone fractures which frequently occur with race horses. Significant racing events, such as theBelmont and the Preakness have in 1982 been won by horses whose prior limb fractures had been aided in repair by equipment of the invention.The prior fractures of these winning horses were of a nature such that, with conventional therapy, it would be an open question whether the horse would ever again be able to race, and certainly the. at least one year previously considered necessary for bone repair in each case would have precluded participation in any post fracture 1982 event, so that entry in either of these prestigious events would have been out of the question. At this point in time, insufficient data have been accumulated to enable a full explanation of the physical process involved in body cell response to the indicated pattern of pulsed electromagnetic fields. However, it is becoming clear that the device of the invention materially accelerates the healing process a horse with a limb fracture of the character indicated can be back in training within the hitherto unheard of short period of 30 to 60 days.The applicators are applied in medial lateral relation to the limb as in Fig. 1 to allow articulation. The pulsed electromagnetic therapy brings blood to the afflicted region, and the described coils appear to have an analgesic effect, inthatpain disappears in 5 to 10 days. The treatment is illustratively applied for two hours per day until there is an X ray appearance of healing an X ray look every three weeks is recommended. Quite aside from use of the described device is post fracture bone healing applications, it is becoming apparent that regular use of the device on an apparently healthy horse produces desirable prophylactic results. We speculate that an apparently healthy horse may have a airline or incipient fracture condition which is not X ray discernable and is certainly not known to his trainer. Such a horse is thus accident prone, but this fact is not known. However, with regular prophylactic use, say for an hour each day while in pasture, particularly after an exhausting workout or a race, the horse is kept in best condition for racing without injury. Although the above described coils and pulse signal parameters have developed an impressive record of successful treatment of race horses, further development indicates the achievement of superb clinical results using significantly reduced energy, longer battery life, and reduced weight. In this development, the coils 22 30 are series connected, each of them being 16 turns of 22 AWG wire. The involved pulse signals comprise a first polarity lowmagnitude pulse of approximately 20 microsecond effective duration, and a second polarity pulse of relatively greater magnitude and approximately 4 microseconds duration. Pulses within each burst are at 33kHz, and the burst repetition rate is 2Hz, amplitudes being such as again to develop a maximum magnetic field strength of approximately 0.5 Gauss during the first polarity pulse.When sufficiently tested, this low energy pulse signal pattern may become our preferred pattern of excitation, and we believe that therapeutic utility exists for even shorter second polarity pulses and for pulse repetition with each burst at frequencies as high as 100kHz or more, with burst repetition within the indicated 1 to 5Hz range. Recent experimental evidence indicates that therapeutically beneficial results are achievable with periodic repetition of a single pulse signal at low energy levels applicable to self contained devices of the above described nature and therefore suitable for equine and other animal bone fracture repair. This evidence pertains to observations on enzyme activity in body cells, in response to electromagnetic stimulation with described coil configurations, the particular enzyme being adenosine triphosphatase otherwise known as Na K ATPase , and the observed result has been a significant increase in the rate of sodium ion eflux and potassiumion influx, within the region of treatment.These enhanced rates importantly relate to bone fracture repair, and in particular to the favourable,treatmentvof the edema or inflammationary swelling surrounding a bone injury not only is the pain materially reduced in intensity and duration, but favourable initiation of a bone repair environment is more rapidly established. The single pulse signals involved are asymmetric and at a repetition rate in the range of 1 to 5Hz, the first portion of each pulse being of approximately 20 microsecond duration, and the second portion of each pulse being of approximately 2 microsecond duration, while energy amplitudes are such as to produce a maximum body induced voltage of approximately 0.1 to 0.5 millivolt per centimeter of treated tissue and or cells. While the invention has been described in detail for a preferred embodiment, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
