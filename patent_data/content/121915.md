## Abstract
A panel structure comprising boards 1a, 1b and for in stance serving as a floor or a panel, the boards 1a, 1b be ing arranged on the same plane edge to edge. The boards are held together two by two by means of a joining moulding 5 of a substantially T shaped cross section. The transverse web 7a, 7b of the joining moulding 5 is provided with a plurality of holding teeth 8 to both sides of the vertical web 6 of said moulding. Each half 7a, 7b of the transverse web 7 projects into its longitudinal locking, relatively deep, and substantially smooth groove 9a, 9b in a board 1a, 1b The width n of the groove 9a, 9b is slightly smaller than the thickness t of said transverse web 7a, 7b . The joining moulding 5 is of a relatively soft material such as plastics or rubber. In this manner the panel struc ture is so simple to mount that the mounting can be carried out by unskilled persons. Without damaging the panel struc ture, the boards may work relative to each other when ex posed to variations in air moisture and or temperature.
