## Description
LIPID MEMBRANE STRUCTURES FOR DRUG DELIVERY The present invention relates to compositions and processes for delivering ph2rmacologically active agents pseferertÃ­ally to the liver. More specifically, Lipid Membrane Structures vesicles , 11liposomes11 comprising digalactosyl diglyceride as a critical part of their makeup carry drug agents such as insulin preferential3.y to the hepatocytes of the liver. The liver is the human body s largest gland and, as such, receives a massive blood supply through both the portal vein and the hepatic artery. Mtabolically, the liver is the most complex organ in the human body and, among other multiple functions, it metabolizes distributes drugs which are introduced into the organism. The liver is also a target organ for pharrnacologically active agents produced within the body. Accordingly, an improved means for preferentially delivering drugs to the liver provides a means for allowing the drug to be handled by the body in a more natural fashion, thereby improving drug therapy The means whereby the liver handles insulin illustrates the activity of this important target organ. Insulin is a hormone which affects the metabolism of the animal as a whole. The most dramatic effect of this hormone is its ability to reduce the concentration o glucose in plasma. Ingested carbohydrate meals are normally digested to glucose in the gut and then absorbed into the portal circulation. The pancreas responds to carbohydrate in the gut with a release of insulin into t e portal circulation. The portal vein carries the absorbed glucose and the released insulin to the liver. At the liver he insulin regulates the metabolism of glucose bv the liver cells.By an unknown mechanism the liver retains most of the insulin but releases some to facilitate glucose utilization by muscle and adipose tissue. Recuc tion blood glucose is due to the insulin effection both liver and peripheral tissues. Thus, while the pancreas is the source of insulin within the organism, the liver is key t its normal utilization. Diabetes mellitus is a generalized, chronic meta bolic disorder manifesting itself in its fully developed form by hyperglycemia, glycosuria, increased protein breakzDwn, ketosis and acidosis. If the disease is pro longed, . it is usually complicated by degenerative disease of t blood vessels, the retina, the kidneys and the nervous system. In diabetes mellitus, the pancreas either produces or releases insufficient insulin following a carbcydrate meal. This insulin deficiency results in an inability of most tissues to utilize the glucose which is in tZ blood.As a result, the blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels. then the blood glucose level exceC s the ability of the kidney to reabsorb glucose flora the plasma ultrafiltrate, it appears in the urine. In addition, the cells of the body fail to metabolize other nutr nts properly and growth is usually impaired. Lack of insulin to tissues eventually also results in abncrmaly high levels of toxic ketone metabolites in the blood. The final combined effect of these changes can be coma and death Insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus began in 1922. In current medical practice insulin is administered subcutaneously because the oral administration of the insulin is inefficient, presumably due to proteolysis. Subcutaneously administered insulin does produce a lowered level of blood glucose, primarily as a result of its action on muscle and fat tissue. In the maintenance of the severely insulin deficient diabetic patient, insulin administration is critical. However, insulin aninistration by injection can hardly be classified as a near normal state. Irortantly, the anatomic arrangement or the pancreas in the normal individual is such that high levels of insulin secreted by the pancreas in response to oral glucose loads pass by way of the portal circulation to the liver before entering the peripheral circulation. By comparison when insulin is administered subcutaneously to the diabetic patient, the peripheral tissue has first access to the hormone and may reduce the level of insulin presented to the liver and, in turn, reduces the efectiveness of the liver as a significant glucose regulating mecnanism.Therefore, insulin administered by injection does not have the same physiological action as insulin released from the pancreas. The present invention provides a means whereby insulin or other pharmacologically active agents can be delivered preferentially to the liver in a human or lower animal The present invention also provides improved means for administering enzymes, vitamins and other drug agents, especially interferon, to humans and lower animals in need of such treatment.

Liposomes comprising certain galactosyl lipids are described in Imumunochemistry, Vol. 11, 475 81 1974 by workers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.Other work on galactosyl lipid membranes has been carried out at the Pasteur Institute ibid. Vol. 13, 28 94 and elsewhere, as reported in Biochimica et Biophysics Acta 311, 531 44 1973 . These latter publications do not appear to report the preparation of liposomes from the membrane material. U.S. Patent 3,937,668, issued February 10, 1976, discloses insulin encapsulated in albumin millimicrospheres. Battelle Memorial Instiis International Division has disclosed a means for encapsulating various water soluble drugs in liposomes using an ultrasonic vibration technique.

The injection of drugs, including insulin, into rats to study the duration of intramuscular absorptionis reported in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 23 10 2218 22 1975 . J. Arehart Treichel, Science News, Vol. 114, No. 4 7 22 78 at page 60 reports that some workers have tagged liposomes with antibodies to help direct lipo somal packaged enzymes to appropriate target cells for the managemen t of certain disease states. A particularly relevant article with regard to the present invention is by Mauk and Gamble, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76, No. 2, pp. 756 769, February, 1979,Biophysics. In that article, the authors report experi ments relating to the work of Lunny and Ashwell Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, 73, 341 343, 1976 that raised the possibility that surface carbohydrates may serve as determinants for recognition of liposomes by particular tissues. The work of Lunney and Ashwell describes 2 specific hepatic receptor capable of recognizing and binding galactose terminated glycoproteins.However, the work of Mauk and Gamble shows that the presence of either fucose or galactose on the surface of the particular vesicles they studied causes no statistically significant alteration in the tissue distribution of the vesicles. Gregoriadis, Biochemical Society Transactions,Vol. 3 1975 p. 613 reports the delivery of bleomycin and radioisotopes but not insulin or interferon to the liver using liposomes comprising asialofetuin. Asialofetuin contains a galactosyl unit. The work indicates that liver uptake over controls was enhanced, but the statistical significance of the data is unclear. U.S. Patent 4,016,100, issued April 5, 1977, discloses a pnarmaceutical composition which is prepared by dispersing a phospholipid in.water, adding a medicament to the aqueous dispersion, freezing said acueous dispersing to entrap the medicament in lipid spherules, and then thawing the frozen dispersion to give an aqueous suspension of the medicament entrapped in the lipid spherules.

The phase behavior of glycolipids and phospholipids are compared and consicer2a in terms of their respective roles in plan and animal cell membranes. Disclosure of Invention The present invention encompasses Lipid MembraneStructures for aoministering drugs, diagnostic agents, or the like, to a human or lower animal, comprising a mixture of a major portion of a polar lipid and a minor portion of a digalactosyl derivative having at least one fatty substituent. The invention also encompasses compositions of matter comprising a first component which is a drug, diagnostic agent, or the like, said first component being encapsulated in or associated with a second component which comprises the aforesaid Lipid Membrane Structure which comprises a mixture of a major portion of a polar lipid and a minor portion of a digalactosyl derivative having at least one fatty substituent. The invention also encompasses means for delivering a drug or radiodiagnostic agent to the hepatocytes of the liver of a human or lower animal by means of Lipid MembraneStructures of the herein disclosed type. The special advantage of the present invention resides in the discovery that the digalactosyl moiety targets the Lipid Membrane Structures preferentially to the hepatocytes of the liver. Thus, insulin can be delivered to the liver of the diabetic patient, where it is handled in a manner akin to that in the non diabetic. The Lipid Membrane Structures can also be used to deliver other drugs and diagnostic agents to the liver as an aid in treatment of diseases involving that organ, itself.

DGDG occurs in nature and Ã¬ reported to have the structure EMI11.1 wherein each R substituent is in Ue C 15 C17 chain range, ca. 20 palmitic, 9 oleic, 66 linoleic, the balance being stearic, linolenic and other minors. Myhre, CanadianJournal of Chemistry 46, 19, 3071 77 1968 , incorporated herein by reference. The DGDG used in this invention was secured in the manner cisclosed by yore, above. Russell iller American Beauty soft wheat flour 23 kg. was suspended in ethanol 46 Q and the mixture was allowed to stand for several hours. The supernatant was withdrawn and filtered and the insoluble residue was extracted twice as before. The filtrates were evaporated to a syrup 215 g. . In a typical run a portion of the ethanol extracted material 20 30 g. from above was dissolved in chloroform 200 ml. and applied to a column of silicic acid 100 mesh 3.6 x 88 cm. which had been washed previously, first with chloroform methanol 50 50 v v and then with chloroform. The column was irrigated with chloroform followed by mixtures of chloroform and methanol similar to the method of Carter et a1., J. Lipid Res. 2, 215 1961 .Each fraction collected amounted to ca. 15 20 Is. Appro priate fractions were combined, evaporated and the residues were stored at 0 C until used. The fractions collected were as follows see Myhre, above, for complete analyses of individual fractions .

In this procedure, the term DSL refers to distearoyl lecithin and the term DGDG refers to digalactosyl diglyceride prepared in the manner of Myhre, above. A glass syringe was fitted with a piece of polypropylene tubing to facilitate aliquoting the DGDG stock solution below . Likewise, a 5.0 ml. glass syringe was fitted with a piece of 1 mm. ID polypropylene tubing to aliquot the DSL stock solution below . A 10.0 ml. glass syringe fitted with an 18 gauge needle was used througr out the procedure to aliuot 8.0 ml. of commercial insulin Stock solution. 6.0 ml. of stock DSL and 2.0 ml. of stock DGDG were transferred to a 50 ml. Erlenmeyer weighing flask with very gentle mixing under dry nitrogen.The flask was then situated in a 550C water bath while nitrogen was blown over the sample to dry the lipid com ponents. The sample flask was then placed on a Buchi Rotoevaporator under house vacuum and rotated slowly for 15 minutes while the temperature was maintained at 65 C win a water bath. The dried sample was then flushed with nitrogen and 12.0 ml. of insulin stock solution below was added. The flask was then positioned in a micro tip or, preferably, a cup horn sonicator reservoir Heat SystemsUltrasonics such that the bottom surface of the flask maintained a 1 16 inch clearance from the radiating surface of the horn. In order to provide for continuous monitoring cf the reaction temperature, a thermistor probe was insert in the aqueous phase. A glass stopper was then inserted in the neck of the flask and wrapped securely with PrafF1 to seal and prevent evaporation of the aqueous components during sonication on. The temperature of the reaction mix tr was maintained at a constant 60 C tO.500 for a 45minute period. Temperature control was achieved using a Lauca N 9 circulatins water bath.In addition, the bath level in the cup horn reservoir was maintained S inches above the radiating surface of the horn to facilitate temperature control in the reaction meals. The power output needed for sonication was derived from a model 350 power amplifier from Heat Systems Ultrasonic. The power output control was set at position J3 to provide power output equivalent to 40 60 o amplifier capacity. The electrical energy delivered to the horn was transduced to provide the ultrasonic energy needed for sonication. Following sonication the condensed vapor and lipid components were mixed. The sample was then placed on aBuchi Roto evaporator and annealed with slow turning in a 65 C water bath for 1 hour. Immediately following this initial annealing the sample was incubated at room temperature for 1 2 hour. A second annealing, identical to the first, followed the incubation period. In order to free the insulin containing LMS from external insulin a minimum of five washes were conducted using 2 Beckman L 5 ultracentrifuge equipped with an S.W. 60 heaa. The insulin LMS preparation was transferred to a 3.0 ml. capacity polyallomer centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 2 hours. Stock solutions used in the foregoing process were as follows. Stock DSL comprises 57.69 mg. of DSL per ml.of a 2 1 v v CHCl3 methanol. Stock DGDG comprises 6.926 mg. ml. CHCl3 methanol 2 1 v v . Insulin stock solution comprising 8.0 ml Lillv Insulin 100 units per ml. 0.2 wt. phenol and 4.0 1odine 125 Insulin, Amersham, containing 0.5E w w albumin and 0.05 thimerosal. In an alternate node in the above process which is preferred for securing higher concentrations of insulin associated with the TMS, 100 mg crystalline insulin 15 added directly to the mixture of stock solutions or DSL and DGDG. The suspension or crystalline insulin is sonicated ca. 30 sec room temp. with the cup horn sonication to dispense the insulin. Following vacuum evaporation of solvent, as disclosed, the dried sample is treated with the insulin stock solution, sonicated, etc., as described above. It will be appreciated that the foregoing procedures can be modified by replacing the insulin solution with a solution of other drug agent of choice to secure LMS comprising such other drug agent. LMS containing various percentages of DGDG, or without DGDG for use in control experiments, can also b prepared using the foregoing sonication technique. In like manner, various DGDG con,aining LMS can be prepared by sonicating. DGDG with glycerides lipids other than DSL. Other general procedures for preparing LMS withoutDGDG are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,016,29Q, issued April 5, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. Such procedures can also be used herein by adding the appropriate level of DGDG to the art disclosed polar lipids and proceeding in the manner described in the referenced patent. The stability of the TIS herein is substantially enhanced by suspension in an aqueous electrolyte solution. This is presumably due to osmotic pressure considerations. Pharmaceutically acceptable electrolytes such 25 KC1 and NaC1 preferred are useful for this purpose. Physiologic saline commercial can be used. The resulting DMS suspensions in aqueous electrolyte are suitable for direct use ifl the manner disclosed. Insulin LMS prepared in the foregoing manner can be ized by liquid chromatography on Sepharose 2S harmacia , using standard techniques. For example, te sonicated insulin LMS is centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 1 hour to remove large particle size vesicles, aggregates and undefined structures. Chromatography of the remaining material on Sepharose 2b provides insulin vesicle in the 750 Angstrom 3000 Angstrom range. Additionally, insulin not associated with theLMS is desirably removed from the final composition by this procedure. If desired, larger vesicles greater than ca. 4000 A can be separated from smaller vesicles using hydrodynamic chromatography. Animal Testing Animal tests were run to demonstrate the effective ness of the insulin LMS with DGDG for controlling glucose.The studies also demonstrated that insulin 1j S withoutDGDG are only about as effective as insulin in this regard.The studies also demonstrated that the effect of insulin LMS with DGDG in the diabetic animal is very much like that obtained through natural body mechanisms in a healthy animal. In contrast, insulin and insulin LMS without DC DG yield dose responses which are quite different from normal. Study I The insulin used in this study was regular pork i.n jectable insulin, 100 units cc. Eli Lilly, Indianapolis .The digalactosyl diglyceride DGDG and distearoyl lecithin DSL were as disclosed above. Pour preparations were tested 100 DSL insulin 96 DSL 4 DGDG insulin 96 DSL t 4 DGDG saline and insulin. The L slS with insulin or saline, with and without DGDG, were pre pared by sonication. Briefly, the four compositions were separately administered to animals via catheter directly into the duodenum. The animals had been fasted 20 hours prior to administration The results from the study indicated that animals receiving insulin vMS compositions with DGDG exhibited a significant hypoglycemic effect when compared with the insulin treated controls. Indeed, insulin, LMS DG saline, and LAS insulin without DGDG did not produce significant hypoglycemia. Glucose values for insulin LMS with DGDG were significantly different from the regular insulin treatment at 50, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes. Glucose values for insulin LMS with DGDG were significantly different from insulin LMS without DGDG treatment at 75, 105 and 120 minutes, and also for saline LMS 1 DGDG at 105 minutes. As disclosed above, other workers have shown that lipid liposome insulin preparations can induce hypoglycemia in diabetic rats. Doses used by those workers were in the range of 50 100 units of insulin kg., and hypoglycemic effects were observed only in diabetic rats but not in intact animals. In the present study, the only group which showed significant hypoglycemia was the insulin LMS with DGDG group. Doses in this study were estimated by ultraviolet absorption to be ca. 3 units kg. Study II A second study was carrid out in substantially the sue manner as Study I, but with a lower dose oi insulin 0.35 units kg. of body weight . The LMS were prepared by sonication, with annealing at 67 C for 60 minutes. The results from Study II confirmed that low doses 0.35 u kg. bod weight of DSL DGDG insulin LMS, when administered intraduodenally to fasted, intact and awake animals produce a biologically and statistically significant hypoglycemic response 45 75 minutes post dosing.Moreover, DSL insulin LM.S which did not contain the DGDG had no effect on plasma glucose. Finally, regular insulin and saline administered intraduodenally had no effect on plasma glucose values in Study II. Study III In this study, insulin was administered via the duodenws to diabetic animals so that any insulin that was absorbed would be presented to the liver via the portal circulation, thereby mimicking the normal pattern of insulin delivery. Three forms of insulin were tested regular insulin, insulin in DSL LMS structures withoutDGDG and insulin in DSL LMS structures containing DGDG. Animals were made diabetic by administering intravenously 50 mg. Alloxan kg. body weight and 30 mg. Streptozotocin kg. body weight to the fasted animals. Insulin administration was withdrawn from each animal hours before catheterization. Six days after induction of diabetes, studies were begun iollowÃ¬ng the general technique of Studies I and Ii, herein. Insulin used in the study was regular pork insulin for injection Lilly . The LS preparations were as inStudies I and II. Three groups of animals were used in the study the animals were anesthetized and catheters were placed surgically. Blood for the determination of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations was collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 150 minutes. At 0 time, each test and received a 10 ml. infusion of saline, 37 C, into the duodenum. Immediately after the 60 minute blood samples were collected, the animals in Group 1 received 10 units insulin kg. body weIght as regular insulin injected into the duodenum the animals the Group 2 received 10 units kg. body weight of LMS insulin without DGDG and Group 3 received 10 units insulin kg. body weight in LMS containing Ã DGDG. In Study III the regular insulin was shown to have no effect either on circulating levels of plasma glucose or on the uptake of glucose by the liver. Insulin aemin istered in LAS without DGDG had no effect on plasma glucose, nor did it restore hepatic glucose retention utilization in the diabetic animals. In contrast, animals that received insulin in LMS containing DGDG introduodenally did show a significant fall in plasma glucose in two of three test animals. The decline in glucose was greatest 90 minutes following acr.inistration, and the fall began at 15 minutes. An increase in the hepatic retention of glucose was demonstrable at 15 minutes and was maximum at 60 minutes, then returned towards base line levels. at 9C minutes.The uptake of glucose by hepatic tissue could have accounted for the fall in plasma glucose. eased on the results of Study III, it was concluded that regular insulin and the insulin administered in TNS without added DGDG had no effect on either plasma glucose or hepatic or peripheral retention of glucose. In contrast, the same dosage of insulin in LMS containing DGDG did induce a hypoglycemic response in the peripheral plasma. Moreover, it was demonstrated by calculation of glucose differences portal vein minus hepatic vein that there was an increased hepatic uptake of glucose in animals which had received the insulin LMS with DGDG. Study IV In normal control animals it was found that the liver changes from a condition of glucose output in the basal fasting state to one of uptake when it is presented with infused glucose. This is the kind of response expected in an individual whose pancreas and liver are functioning normally. Control diabetic animals, on the other hand, lose this ability to take up glucose by the liver and they maintain a net output of glucose throughout experiments even though large amounts of glucose are being infused into the portal system. Therefore, the diabetic faces the problem that even though large amounts of glucose are ingested via the digestive tract and the portal blood system, the liver continues to make even more glucose instead of storing glucose that is ingested. In this study insulin in lipid membrane structures 96 DSL and 4 DGDG was infused into the jugular vein of diabetic dogs. During this interval the same dogs were infused with glucose via the mesenteric vein portal system at a rate of 0.5 grams glucose kg. body weight hour. The animals were prepared in such a way that uh liver was isolated for metabolic studies. The hepatic artery was ligated so that the only incoming blood came in via the portal system and exited via the hepatic vein.Catheters were placed into the hilus of the liver in the portal vein so that ingoing blood could be sampled at that point, and another catheter was placed in the hepatic vein so tat blood leaving the liver could be sampled. Hepatic blood flows were measured by infusing a bolus of indocyanine green into a mesenteric vein. The appearance of the indocyanine green was detected by a constant withdrawl of blood from the hepatic vein and analyzed by aGilford Cardiac Output system which computes the rate of flow. Therefore, the system was one in which concentrations of glucose could be determined going into and coming out of the liver, and the flow rate of the blood was also known.The calculation of concentration of glucose multi plied by the flow rate gives the absolute amount of glucose either taken up by the liver or released by the liver. Insulin was infused into the diabetic dogs via either the jugular vein or the portal vein. The dose responses for the effect of insulin upon the hepatic retention or glucose phenomenon were determined. It was shown that the portally infused insulin could produce a normal hepatic uptake of glucose at a dose of 1.0 milliunits of insulin infused per minut kg. body weight, whereas to accomplish the same effect insulin infused into the jugular vein required a dose of 6.25 milliunits kg. body weight minute. A jugular dose of 2.5 milliunits kg. body weight was ineffective in converting the liver from a state of glucose output to a state of glucose uptake. The insulin lipid membrane structure containing the Digalactosyl Diglyceride 4 w w was active when infused in the jugular vein at a dose range of 0.026 to 0.4 milliunits insulin kg. body weight minute. The dramatic reversal of the hepatic system rorn glucose output to glucose uptake at this low dose is consistent with the position that the insulin in the Th4S with DGDG is directed to the hepatocytes, which release the insulin in sore manner, which, in turn, causes a conversion fro a state of glucose output to a state of glucose uptake. Based on the results of Study IV, it was concluded that the liver directed LMS system with the DGDG provides the liver with an adequate dose of insulin to convert it to a hepatic storage of glucose mode at a much lower dose than is seen with the regular insulin. The DSL DGDG LMS thus allows the animal to have 2 normal metabolic pattern for handling ingested glucose. loads, as compared with the inability of regularly administered without the DSL DGDGLMS insulin to cause this effect. Industrial Applicabilitv In general, the LMS comprise from about 90 to about 99.9 by weight of the polalipid and from about 0.1 to about 10 by weight of the digalactosyl derivative. MS which comprise from about 95 to about 99 by wight of the polar lipid and from about 1 to about 5 by weight of the digalactosyl derivative are highly preferred. The following are typical polar lipids useful in the practice of this invention dicetyl phosphate, stearylamine, phosphatidic acid, dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline, dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline, sphingomyelin, phosphatidyl lnositol, cardiolipin, lysophosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl etnanolamine, gangliosides, phosphatidyl serine, and mixtures Thereof. These polar lipids are available using art disclosed methods see references cited in Gregoriadis, above . Cholesterol is a polar lipid often used in combination with art disclosed polar lipids to stabilize the walls of vesicles and liposomes, and can optionally be used in the same manner with the LMS of this invention. The preferred polar lipids for preparing the LMS comprise the dialkanoyl lecithins wherein the alkanoyl groups each contain from about 12 to about 20 carbon atoms. LMS wherein the alkanoyl groups are selected from palmitoyl and stearoyl, especially diste oyl lecithin, are most preferred. LAS wherein the digalactosyl derivative is a fatty glyceride digalactosyl derivative characterized by at least one fatty substituent having a chain length in the range from about C12 to about C20, especially those where the digalactosyl derivative is a diglycerid,.are highly preferred. LMS wherein the digalactosyl derivative is Digalactosyl Diglyceride of the formula disclosed above DGDG are most highly preferred for directing drugs, raaionuclides, and the like to the liver in humans and lower aninals.
