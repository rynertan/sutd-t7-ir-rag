# Improvements in and relating to apparatus for checking the validity of coins.

## Abstract
Apparatus for checking the validity of coins, the appar atus requiring electrical power for its coin checking opera tion, and comprising means 4,5,6 defining a coin path, and at least one means HF1, LF, HF2 for interacting with a coin on the coin path to provide an information signal, characte rised by one of said interacting means HF1 providing an information signal in response to at least the great majority of coin types, circuit means 316, 315 for determining whether the information signals are indicative of an accept able coin, and detector means 316 operable by the occurrence of the information signal from said one interact ing means to initiate the application within the apparatus of power adequate for its coin checking operation, the detector means being adapted to so operate irrespective of whether or not the information signal from said one interacting means is indicative of an acceptable coin, whereby said power application occurs substantially every time a coin passes along the coin path.
