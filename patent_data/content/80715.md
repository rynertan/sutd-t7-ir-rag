# Gas laser device.

## Abstract
A gas laser has an electrode of improved construction. The electrode, for example a cathode, comprises an inner cathode 20 and at least an outer cathode 21 spaced from the inner cathode 20 and disposed on the side closer to an anode 12 . Each of the cathodes 20, 21 has a central hole 24 from which a glow discharge 31 is formed, and the outer cathode 21 further has a plurality of through holes 25 around the central hole 24 . A gas medium 10 flowing in a discharge tube 2 passes through the central hole 24 of the inner cathode 20 via the central hole 24 and through holes 25 of the outer cathode 21 . The gas medium 10 forcedly enters the glow discharge 31 from the inner cathode 20 thereby to cause it to expand and a part of the gas medium having passed through the through holes 25 of the outer cathode 21 squeezes the glow discharge 31B from the outer cathode 21 so that the glow discharge 31B can enter the glow discharge 31A from the inner cathode 20 . Therefore, the current density of the glow discharge 31 in the discharge tube 2 is made uniform.
