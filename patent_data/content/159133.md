# Low tyre pressure warning devices.

## Abstract
A low tyre pressure warning device comprises a body defining a passage which is connected by air pipes to the valves of two adjacent tyres on the axle of a truck. The air pressure in the passage is normally the common pressure of the two tyres. If one of the tyres develops a leak, the common air pressure drops until a spring actuated piston moves to seal the passage and closes a set of contacts. A miniature radio transmitter in the body of the device is activated, sending a warning signal to a receiver in the cab of the truck, and further air leakage from the good tyre is halted.
