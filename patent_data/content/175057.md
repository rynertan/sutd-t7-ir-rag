# Method and apparatus for dry offset intaglio printing.

## Abstract
An intaglio cylinder 32 for effecting intaglio printing is disposed in contact with an impression cylinder 31 and a blanket cylinder 33 for effecting dry offset printing is dis posed in contact with the intaglio cylinder. These cylinders are disposed such that a line interconnecting the axes of the impression cylinder and the intaglio cylinder will make an angle of about 90 with respect to a line interconnecting the axes of the intaglio cylinder and the blanket cylinder. When printing with the printing press described above a method is used comprising the steps of forming an intaglio image on the intaglio cylinder, forming a dry offset image on the blanket cylinder, transfering the dry offset image on the blanket cylinder onto non image portions of the intaglio cylinder, and simultaneously transfering the dry offset im age and the intaglio image on the intaglio cylinder onto a sheet wrapped about the impression cylinder.
