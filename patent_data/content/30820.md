## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO SAFETY PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICES TECXEsICiI FIELD This invention relates to safety pressure relief devices used to protect pressure vessels, and more particularly to such devices incorporating bursting discs. BACKGROUND ART It is established practice to utilise flat discs of resin impregnated graphite as the bursting member of a safety pressure relief device, the internal surface of the disc sealing an inlet bore of the device in communication with the interior of the vessel the pressure in which is to be monitored. The bursting disc is chosen such that, when the pressure differential across the disc reaches a predetermined maximum value, the disc bursts to vent the vessel. Such discs are commonly required to have a two way action whereby bursting occurs either when the pressure differential across the disc reaches a first predetermined value with the pressure within the vessel greater than that outside the vessel i.e.forward bursting or when the pressure differential across the disc reaches a further predetermined value with the pressure within the vessel less than that outside the vessel i.e. reverse bursting. It is usual for said first Ã…ana further predetermined values for effecting forward and reverse bursting respectively to be different, and, in order for the same disc to be used for the two purposes, it has heretofore been necessary ether to make the effective areas of the opposed surfaces of the disc different from one another by reducing as necessary the diameter of one or other of the inlet and outlet bores of the device compared with the other of the inlet and outlet bores, or to fit a vacuum support dial overlying one side of the disc. Clearly any difference in the diameters of the inlet and outlet bores, or the presence of a vacuum support dial within the device can seriously reduce the venting rate of the system on bursting of the disc. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided a safety pressure relief device for use on a pressure vessel, the device comprising axially aligned annular inlet and outlet support members between which are clamped the peripheral regicns of a flat bursting disc of a frangible material, characterised in that one or more grooves are machined in at least one surface of the disc, said groove s being located symmetrically of the central axis of the device. In such a device incorporating a bursting disc only one surface of which is grooved it is found that, with the greater pressure applied to the grooved surface, the bursting pressure of the disc remains substantially constant over a substantial range of depths of the groove, said bursting pressure being less than that for an equivalent, non grooved disc. However, with the greater pressure applied to the non grooved surface of such a disc, the bursting pressure of the disc is very sensitive to, and dependent upon, the depth of the groove in the opposite surface, said bursting pressure being less than that in the opposite direction. Further, if grooves are machined in both surfaces of a disc, it is found that the groove in the surface opposite to that on wnich the greater pressure is being applied is dominant in determining the bursting pressure of the disc in that direction the deeper said groove in the opposite surface, the lower is the bursting pressure of the disc in that direction. Thus it will be appreciated that a disc can be carefully machined to provide one or more grooves of controlled depth in one or both surfaces thereof in such a manner that said disc will burst at different, controlled pressures in the forward and reverse directions. Such an arrangement enables different bursting pressures in the forward and reverse directions to be achieved in safety pressure relief devices having inlet and outlet bores of the same diameter and without the use of vacuum support dials, thus eliminating the restriction on venting that can occur in the aforementioned prior art devices. However grooved discs may be used in conjunction with inlet and outlet support members of different internal diameters. In G preferred safety pressure relief device the internal diameters of the inlet and outlet support members are identical, the disc having an annular groove formed in the surface of the disc opposite to tat to be subjected to the pressure within the vessel, said groove having a mean diameter substantially equal to the internal diameter of the outlet support member. The transverse section of the or each groove preferably includes at least one angular portion conveniently at or adjacent the base of the groove and said transverse section may be V shape, square shape or rectangular shape. At burst, failure of tiie disc takes place around a line defined by the base of the groove, the bores through the inlet and cutlet support members being fully opened on bursting of the disc to permit fullbore discharge from an overpressurised vessel. A preferred disc is of resin impregnated graphite, altnough other frangible materials may be used. 3PI F DE3CRITIOiNT OF Trm DRAWINGS Figs. 1 to 3 illustrate three examples of safety pressure relief devices according to the invention. BST M03 OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Ref erring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, a resinimpregnated graphite bursting disc is indicated generally at 2 and is mounted between axially aligned annular inlet and outlet support rings 4,6 respectively, the bores 8,10 through which are of the same diameter. An annular groove 12 of generally V shape in transverse section is formed in the surface 14 of the disc 2 remote from the interior of the vessel on which the device is to be mounted. The groove is symmetrically located in the disc so that the diameter of the base thereof corresponds with that of the bores 8,10 of the rings 4,6 and the disc is positioned with the base of the groove 12 axially aligned with the inner faces of the inlet and outlet rings 4,6 i.e. directly below the inner face of the outlet support ring 6. The thickness of the disc 2 and the depth of the groove 12 carefully machined in the disc 2 are chosen such that the critical pressure at which the disc will fracture in the forward direction i.e. with higher pressure P tothe inlet side of the disc is equal to a desired value, while the critical pressure at which the disc will fracture in the reverse direction i.e. with higher pressure to tile outlet side of the disc is equal to a desired higher value. The illustrated disc thus has a controlled two way action and provides full bore relief from the over or under pressurised system, in that the disc fractures about the base of the groove 12 and fully opens the inlet and outlet bores 8,10 which form continuations one of the other. As mentioned above, the critical pressure of the disc in the forward direction, with the pressure P within the vessel greater than that outside the vessel, is closely related to the depth of the groove as well as being dependent upon the thickness of the disc 2 and the diameter of the bore 8. However the critical pressure of the disc in the reverse direction is substantially independent of the depth of the groove 12, being more closely related to the thickness of the disc and the diameter of the bore 10. Thus, by choosing appropriate values of disc thickness and notch depth and by orientating the disc 2 correctly within its holder, it is possible to achieve any desired combination of forward and reverse bursting pressures. Although the precise depth of the groove 12 is critical to the bursting pressure of the disc when the greater pressure is applied to the opposite surface of the disc, it is found that the width and transverse configuration of the groove can be varied within certain limits without altering the bursting pressure of the disc. If the internal diameter of the inlet and outlet support rings 4,6 is 100mm, a 2.3mm thick disc of resin impregnated graphite in which is machined a 100mm diameter groove 12 of V shaped transverse section having a depth of 2.Omm located with its grooved surface te the outlet side of the device results in a device having a forward bursting pressure i.e. in the direction of the arrow P of 0.27kgm cm2 and a 2 reverse bursting pressure of O.6Okgm cm Figs. 2 and 3 show alternative discs 2 in which the grooves 12a and 12b are square and rectangular respectively in transverse section, the effects of such grooves being substantially as described with reference to Fig. 1. As mentioned above, for a given configuration of groove, the depth thereof is the crucial factor in determining the bursting pressure when the greater pressure is incident on the non grooved surface of the disc, the width and the precise transverse sectional shape being capable of being varied quite substantially without affecting the critical pressure. However, it is preferred that the cross sectional shape of a groove includes an angular portion therein preferably located at or adjacent the base of the groove to constitute a predetermined starting point for fracture of the disc. If a disc is grooved on both inlet and outlet surfaces, it is again found that, for any given total groove depth, the bursting pressure with greater pressure applied to one surface of the disc is influenced sensitively by the depth of the groove in the other surface of the disc. The grooves may be linear and may extend, for example, radially or diametrically of the disc surface instead of, or as well as, being circular as detailed above more than one groove may be formed in a or each surface of the disc as required, provided the grooves on any one surface of the disc, when considered in total, are symmetrically disposed about the axial centreline of the device with the disc in its operative position.
