# Process for purifying aluminum.

## Abstract
In melting aluminium containing impurities which form a eutectic with the aluminum and solidifying the molten aluminium by cooling, the aluminum is purified by breaking down dendrites extending from the liquid solid interface into the liquid phase to release impurities from between the dendrites or between the branches of the dendrites, and dispersing the released impurities in the entire body of the liquid phase.
