## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a herbicidal composition and more particularly, to a composition comprising an halo acetanilide and a 4 phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acid or derivative thereofDiscussion of the Prior Art Phytotoxic Vc halo acetanilides are disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,442,945. These materials although very effective as preemergence herbicides against annual grassy weeds have been found not to be generally effective against such weed gasses once the weed grass has reached the one to two leaf stage of growth. An improved herbicide containing an g halo acetanilide which is effective at all timings, i.e. both at preemergence applications and at postemergence applications, is needed and is desired. U.S. Patent 3,954,442 reveals herbicidal compositions comprising 4 phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, it has been found that certain of these acids and derivatives thereof when combined with the tS halo acetani lides discussed above, lead to a post emergence effect against weed grasses even after such weed grasses have reached the one or two leaf stage.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a herbicidal composition and more particularly, to a composition comprising an halo acetani3ide and a 4 phenoxy phenoxy alkanecarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof. The composition comprises 1 an 4 haloacetanilide selected from the group consisting cfEMI1.1 EMI2.1 wherein R is alkyl having a maximum of 18 carbon atoms or phenyl of the structureEMI2.2 where Y and Y1 are hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy having a maximum of 10 carbon atoms, and Y2 and Y3 and Y4 are hydrogen, halogen, or alkyl having a maximum of 10 carbon atoms A is oxygen or sulfur X is chlorine, bromine or iodine and Z, z1 and Z2 are hydrogen alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy or polyalkoxy each of froml to 18 carbon atoms, aryl having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms, heterocyclyl having a maximum of 24 carbon atoms and from 1 to 3 hetero atoms, or two of the Z groups are combined to form a bivalent alkylene radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms R1 is tertiary alkyl of not less than 4 and maximum of 10 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl of not more than 8 carbon atoms or alkoxy of not more than 4 carbon atoms R is hydrogen, primary or secondary alkyl of each of not more than 6 carbon atoms, chloride or nitro, provided that one and not more than one of R2 and R3 is always hydrogen unless R2 is primary or secondary alkyl in which case R3 is as defined above and further provided that R2 is primary or secondary alkyl when R3 is chloride or nitro R4 is alkyl of not more than 8 carbon atoms R5 is primary or secondary alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl or alkynyl each of not more than 6 carbon atoms R6 is primary alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, each of not more than 4 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine and 2 a 4 phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic compound having a structural formulaEMI3.1 where Hal is a halogen and R7 represents hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or the cation of an acceptable inorganic or organic base.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention is described primarily In terms of an improved herbicidal composition compromising 2 chloro 2 , 6 diethyl N methoxymetbyl acetanilide and methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate, however, it will be understood that such description is exemplary only and is for purposes of exposition and not for purposes of limitation. It will be readily appreciated that the inventive concept described is equally applicable to an improved herbicidal composition comprising any suitable v haloacetanilide and the 4C phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acid corresponding to the above described ester and any suitable ester or salt thereof. A first herbicidal component comprising a suitable o2 haloacetanilide is selected. A suitable z haloacetanilide is one selected from EMI4.1 wherein R is alkyl having a maximum of 18 carbon atoms, or phenyl of the structureEMI4.2 with Y and Y being hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy having a maximum of 10 carbon atoms, and Y2 Y3 and Y4 being hydrogen, halogen, or alkyl having a maximum of 10 carbon atoms A is oxygen or sulfur X is chlorine, bromine, or iodine and z, z1 and z2 are hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy or polyalkoxy having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, aryl having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms, heterocyclyl having a maximum of 24 carbon atoms and from 1 to 3 hetero atoms, or two of Z groups are combined to form a bivalent alkylene radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. One or more of the Z groups can be provided with non interfering substituents including halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, nitro, dialkylamir.o, carbalkoxy, keto groups and the like.Unless otherwise indicated, alkyl is used generically to include primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl groups R1 is tertiary alkyl of not less than 4 and a maximum of 10 carbon atoms, R2 is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl of not more than 8 carbon atoms or alkoxy of not more than 4 carbon atoms, R is hydrogen, primary or secondary alkyl of not more than 6 carbon atoms, chloride or nitro, provided that one and not more than one of R2 and R3 is always hydrogen unless R2 is primary or secondary alkyl in which case R3 is as defined above and further provided that R2 is primary or secondary alkyl when R3 is chloride or nitro. R4 is alkyl of not more than 8 carbon atoms, R5 is primary or secondary alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl or alkynyl,and of not more than 6 carbon atoms, R6 is primary alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, and of not more than 4 carbon atoms, and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine. Such suitable a6 haloacetanilides and their preparation are revealed in U.S. Patent 3,442,945, which is incorporated by reference hereinto. A second herbicidal component comprising a suitable t phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acid or an ester or salt thereof is selected. A suitable Ot phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acid and derivatives thereof is represented by the formulaEMI5.1 where Hal is a halogen selcted from F Cl, Br, and I, and R7 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or the cation of an acceptable inorganic or organic base.Preferably , where R7 is alkyl, the carbon content thereof is from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and most preferably R7 is methyl. Most preferred is methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate which is commercially available as Hoelon R 3EC or HOE 23408 from American HoechstCorporation. Such suitable tt phenoxy phenoxy alkane carboxylic acids, their esters and their salts and the preparation thereof are described in U.S. Patent 3,954,442, incorporated by reference here into which in turn makes specific response to German Offenlegungsschrift 1,668,896. At least one first and at least one second herbicidal component are combined to form the desired herbicidal active ingredient. The concentration of the second herbicidal component is not critical and is typically combined with the first component in an amount sufficient to impart postemergence effectiveness to grassy weeds in tE,eone to three leaf stage of growth.Typically, the second component is combined with the haloacetanilide in an amount ranging from about 5 to about 75 percent by weight of herbicidal active ingredient. Surprisingl, and unexpectedly, it has been found that the combinationof the herbicidal components and the use of the resultant herbicidal active ingredient in a herbicidal composition results in an effect which is not to be expected, namely upon post emergence application there is an increase in the kill rate of the grassy weeds as reflected by a lower grass count. Herbicidal compositions contain the resultant herbicidal active ingredient in an amount of from about 2 to about 95 percent b weight. The herbicidal compositions can be used in the farm of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, sprayable solutions, dusts or granules, in admixtures with the usual formulation auxiliaries. Wettable powders are preparations that can be uniformly dispersed in water and contain, besides the active ingredient, a diluent or an inert substance, a wetting agent, for example polyoxethylated alkylphenols, polyoxethylated oleyl or stearylamines, alkyl or alkylphenyl sulfonates, and dispersing agents, for example the sodium salt of lignin sulfonic acid, of 2,2 dinaphthylmethane 6,6 disulfonic acid, of dibutyl sulfonic acid or sodium oleylmethyltauride. Emulsion concentrates are obtained by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene, or aromatic hydrocarbons having a higher boiling point. To obtain suspensions or emulsions in water having good properties, wetting agents as specified above are also added. Dusting powders are obtained by grinding the active ingredient with finely divided, solid substances, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophillite, or diatomaceous earths. Spraying solutions commercially available as aerosol sprays contain the active ingredient dissolved in an organic solvent, and in addition thereto a propellant, for example a mixture of fluorochlorohydrocarbons. Granules can be produced by atomizing the active ingredient on to an adsorptive, granulated inert material, or by applying concentrates of the active ingredient to the surface of a support, for example sand, kaolinite or a granulated inert material, with the aid of an adhesive, for example polyvinyl alcohol, the sodium salt of polyacrylic acid, or mineral oils. Alternatively, suitable active ingredients may be made into granules, if desired in admixture with fertilizers, in the manner commonly used for the manufacture of granulated fertilizers. The commercial herbicidal preparations contains varying concentrations of the active ingredients. In wettable powders the concentration of active ingredient varies, for example, from about 10 to 95 8, the remainder being the above formulation additives. Emulsion concentrates contain about 10 to 80 of active ingredient, while dusting powders mostly contain 5 to 20 of active ingredient and sprayable solutions about 2 to 20 8. In the case of granules, the content of active ingredient partially depends on whether the active ingredient is liquid or solid and on the type of granulation auxiliary or filler used. For application the commercial concentrates are optionally diluted in the usual manner, the wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrate, for example with water. Dusts and granulated formulations as well as sprayable solutions are not diluted further with an inert substance before their application. The amount applied varies with the external conditions, such as temperature, humidity and the like. In general, about 0.015 to 0.25 gram and perferably about 0.03 to 0.12 gram of active ingredient per square meter are used. It is of course understood that the herbicidal active ingredient of the present invention can be combined with other herbicides, soil insecticides and with fertilizers.EXAMPLE A naturally occurring infestation of barnyard grass Echinocholoa crus galli and giant foxtail seteria faberii was treated at three stages of growth, i.e., pre emergence, at cracking of the ground and at post emergence. The field was treated with 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl N methoxy methyl acetonilide alone, methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate alone, and a mixture of the foregoing components. There was an overall improved result using the mixture of components as compared to the invidiudal components alone. The mixture of components in the post emergent application thereof exhibited a surprising and unexpected degree of improvement. After application, the weed grasses were visually observed within a 3 aquare foot area and both the grass counts reflecting the kill rate and the grass height reflecting the vigor of the surviving weed plant were determined. Listed below in Tables I, II, III and IV are the results for all three timings. Tables I, II, III and IV reveal an overall improved result when a mixture of components of the invention is employed. Reviewing the data contained in Tables I, II and III, in the light of the test for synergism revealed by Colby, Weeds, Jan. 1967, pp. 20 22, results indicating synergism are obtained. Those results indicating the contrary are as yet unexplainable. Reference is made to Table V, below, which reveals the data for synergism. In arriving at the results listed in Table V below, the average of the control plots for Tables I and III were averaged, i.e., 6 replications and these numbers were included as control data for pre emergence, at cracking and post emergence. The method employed, as in Weeds, is as follows Assuming X1 is the percentage of plants not killed by herbicide A at the dose p, and Y is the percentage of plants not killed by herbicide B at the dose q, the expected percentage, E, of plants not killed by the mixture A B at the dose p q is X1 y E1 1 100Then, it is only necessary to compare E1 with the actual percentage, E, of plants not killed by A B at the dose p q to know the character of the combined action of the two herbicides. If E1 is higher than E, there is synergy.In the opposite case, there is antagonism.
