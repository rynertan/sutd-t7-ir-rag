# FORMATION OF ELECTROMIGRATION RESISTANT ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONDUCTORS

## Abstract
Electromigration resistance of aluminum alloy conduc tors in semiconductor devices is found to significantly increase by rapidly annealing the conductors by employing an annealing cycle with a peak temperature of 520 580 C and a cycle time of about 5 to 30 seconds.
