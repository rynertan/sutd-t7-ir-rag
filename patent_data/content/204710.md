## Description
The invention relates to a process for the removal of sulfur oxides from flue gases. The prior art has recognized two distinct processes for the removal of sulfur oxides from gases scrubbing with lime or neutralization with sodium alkalis. The use of a lime slurry for direct dry scrubbing in a quench reactor results in the vaporization of the slurry water and the formation of dry salt reaction products. The effluent stream leaving the quench reactor contains the reaction products salts of acid gases , unreacted reagent, particulates and unreacted gases. This scrubbing is typically conducted at low stack temperatures. The efficiency of lime slurry neutralization utilizing economic levels of reagent is relatively low, typically on the order of 70 to 80 SO The efficiency of SO In these prior art processes a baghouse is commonly employed to remove the dry products formed in the quench reactor. The dry products are retained as filter cake and the filtered gases are discharged to the atmosphere. The filters are periodically cleaned by shaking, reverse air flow or by pulsed air jets. The adhesive like characteristics of the dry product non free flowing necessitates that the filters be cleaned frequently, and if this is not done, the dry products blind the filter fabric, causing an unacceptably high pressure drop across the baghouse. The essential features of the invention are the subject matter of dependant claim 1 preferred features of the invention are the subject matter of dependant claims 2 9. The present invention stems from the discovery that the efficiency of SO The filter cake contains unreacted reagent due to the normal excess reagent fed to the system. This unreacted reagent neutralizes the residual acid gases flowing through the baghouse. The filter cake dry reaction products accumulated in the baghouse is substantially non tacky. Thus, the cake buildup in the baghouse may be several fold over that which can be tolerated in prior art processes. This in turn makes it possible to extend the duration between cleaning cycles to as much as 50 times that of conventional processes. This increase in cycle time permits the accumulation of a fixed bed cake in the baghouse. Broadly, the invention comprises a method for the removal of sulfur oxides from a gaseous stream with greater efficiencies than conventional processes. The method avoids the necessity for dangerous conditions of operating a baghouse at a temperature close to the dew point. The gaseous stream containing sulfur oxides is introduced into a quench reactor and is contacted with a calcium based reagent containing between about 3 to 30 by weight of a salt, based on the total weight percent of the calcium compound in the reagent. Suitable salts are, CaCl₂, MgCl₂, FeCl₃, MnCl₂, Znl₂, CrCl₂, CdCl₂. The effluent stream from the reactor contains particulates, salts of acid gases containing unreacted reagent, and residual acid gases. The effluent stream flows through a dry venturi. A separate stream containing sorptive material and or fly ash from the baghouse product stream is introduced into the dry venturi to contact the effluent stream to remove submicron particulates therefrom. The effluent stream from the dry venturi flows into a separator where the solids in the stream are collected and form a filter cake. The acid gases in the stream have interfacial contact with the cake and a substantial portion of the SO The process of the present invention results in a capture and neutralization efficiency of SO The effect of the interpositioning of the dry venturi coupled with the baghouse, now with an extended capture cycle prior to cleaning is indicated in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Where a conventional baghouse configuration is employed after a spray drier, the efficiency of the baghouse is nonreproducible with efficiencies ranging from 9 to 41.5 Fig. 1 . The statistical average efficiency is of the order of 25 with little or no variation as a function of the residual the ratio of unreacted lime to the quantity of SO₂ after the spray drier . Thus, in order to achieve an overall efficiency of 75 , the spray drier efficiency must be a minimum of 67 based on the statistical average efficiency of the baghouse. However, based on the wide variation in baghouse efficiency for reaction with SO₂, resulting from the short residence time of the cake, for the objective of safety, the spray drier should have an efficiency, continuously, of 70 or greater. With no prereaction at a low, the dry venturi provides an SO₂ recovery of about 20 Fig. 2 . With prereaction, in the range of residual 2, about 50 Reactor efficiency , the dry venturi provides an efficiency of 28 and the baghouse, an efficiency of 56 Fig. 3 . Without prereaction, the baghouse, an efficiency of 56 Fig. 3 . Without prereaction, the baghouse provides an efficiency of about 20 . Based on an initial feed of lime equivalent to 1.4, the system efficiencies are compared. Therefore, with the combination of the dry venturi and baghouse, an improvement of efficiency ranging from 6 to 15 is achieved over the conventional approach, and combinated with prereaction, the improvement ranges from 13 to 44 . Most importantly, any reduction in efficiency of the reactor is overcome by the secondary reactions provided by the proposed system, thus providing for improved reliability in fulfilling enviromental objectives. The effluent stream from the venturi then proceeds to a conventional baghouse 22 such as a reverse air bag filter, for example available from American Air Filter or Research Cotterell. This stream having a composition of 200 350 PPM SO₂ enters the baghouse 22 at a temperature of between 95 to 105 The filtrate or solution is transported from the filter 24 to a hydrated lime mixing tank 26 for recycle into the system. In the process, substantially increased residence time of the solids in the baghouse or similar collector is achieved. It has been found where conventional clearning cycles for a shaker or reverse air baghouse range from 5 to 30 minutes, the dry venturi action prior to the baghouse increases this cycle time from 4 to 8 hours. Where the conventional pulse jet cleaning cycle is normally 1 to 4 minutes, the dry venturi action prior to the baghouse, increases the cycle time to 30 minutes to 2 hours. A typical example of an operation in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing. A flue gas having a content of 1500 PPM SO₂ is introduced into a quench reactor 10 at a temperature of between about 148 to 235 The effluent stream from the reactor 10 flows to a dry venturi 20 such as disclosed in US Patent 4,319,890. In the dry venturi 20 submicron particulates including sulfuric acid are collected on limestone or equivalent targets introduced from a source 22. Equivalent targets include alkaline bypass waste from Portland cement manufacture, crystalline phonolites or syenites, recycled fly ash. This increase in the cycle time permits the accumulation of a fixed bed cake on the bags or other substrate with no increase in the pressure drop in the baghouse. The cake contains unreacted reagent due to the normal excess reagent fed to the system. With the prior art normal cycle times only 3 9 of the total SO₂ entering the baghouse is removed from the gas by the baghouse cake see That is, the prior art baghouse cake SO With the use of the dry venturi baghouse combination permitting the residence time in the baghouse to exceed three hours, the efficiency of SO The conventional baghouse cake thickness, between 0.1 and 0.5 mm is too low to provide effective fixed bed reaction capability and will also, because of uneven deposition, have now spots where the gas will pass through unaffected by the cake. The present inventive system even with uneven cake provides for effective reaction.
