## Description
This invention relates to constant velocity ratio universal joints of the type comprising an inner member having a number of circumferentially spaced radially outwardly extending arms each of which carries a roller element, the roller elements engaging in longitudinally extending grooves in an outer joint member so that torque can be transmitted between the inner and outer joint members whilst accommodating angular misalignment between the rotational axes of the members. Such a joint will hereafter be referred to as a joint of the kind specified, and is usually known as a tripode joint or bipode joint if the inner member has three or two arms, respectively. The most usual configuration of the inner member of a joint of the kind specified at present is a component in the form of a ring integral with the arms which extend outwardly therefrom, such component being made by forging. The ring has a splined interior for receiving a removable shaft. This construction has a disadvantage in that the torque transmitting capacity of the joint is limited by the dimensions of the ring and the splined connection between the ring and shaft. This is because such connection is effective at a small radius compared with that at which the connection between the rollers and joint outer member is effective, giving rise to relatively high stresses.To increase the capacity of the joint, the splined end of the shaft engaging in the inner member must be made larger, which means that the size of the joint as a whole must be increased, to a size greater than that which would be necessary if its capacity were determined solely by the loads acceptable in the engagement of the rollers with the joint outer member. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or reduce this disadvantage. According to the invention, we provide a method of making an inner member for a universal joint of the kind specified, comprising providing a shaft component and forming same with an end portion having formations for receiving the arms which are to carry the roller elements of the joint, providing said arms as separate components, and fitting said arms into said formations and securing them together and to said shaft component. By making the joint inner member according to this method, the need for provision of a splined connetion with a shaft component is avoided. The arms can relatively easily be made as individual components, e.g. from bar stock, and there is no complex forging operation as common hitherto. The formations in said end portion of the shaft component may be radially outwardly facing apertures, or may be axially presented recesses at the end of the shaft component. The shaft component may be made by a cold forming process. These and other features of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1. is a side view, partly in section, of a universal joint according to the invention. Figure 2 is a section on the line 2 2 of figure 1. Figure 3 is a perspective view illustrating a further construction of inner member of a universal joint according to the invention. Figure 4 is a view of part of the inner member of figure 3. Referring firstly to figures 1 and 2, there is shown a tripode joint comprising an inner member 10 and an outer member 11. The inner member 10 takes the form of a somewhat enlarged or bulbous end portion 12 of a shaft 13, the portion 12 having three equally circumferentially spaced radially outwardly facing apertures 14. Each of the apertures 14 receives a cylindrical arm 15, the part of each arm 15 lying outside the part 12 carrying a roller 16 with the intermediary of a needle roller bearing 17. The outer surface of each of the rollers 16 is of part spherical form. A circlip and retaining washer 18 retains each roller 16 on its respective arm. The outer member 11 of the joint, which is integral with a shaft 19, is a component which affords a hollow interior bounded by a wall with three longitudinally extending slots 20 each of which receives one of the rollers 16. The shape of the opposed walls of each slot 20 corresponds to the exterior shape of the roller which fits in it, so that the roller is free to slide axially in, and tilt relative to, its slot.This enables torque transmission between the inner and outer of joint members while their axes are angularly misaligned, as is well known for tripode joints of the type described. The arms 15 are welded to the end portion 12 of shaft component 13, so that they are positively held in place in their apertures 14 and secured to each other. In this case, the end of part 12 is open at 21 to permit such welding at the innermost ends of the arms. Also, mechanical fastening means, such as for example circlips, engaging in grooves or other appropriate formations in the arms and shaft component may be used to assist retension or location of the arms. In either event, the necessity of having a splined connection between a shaft and the inner joint member is avoided. The connection between the end of the shaft com poneqt and the arms does not require as much space as would be necessary for a splined connection between shaft and joint member, leading to an overall reduction in the dimensions of the joint. The enlarged end portion 12 may be formed on the shaft component 13 by a cold heading technique. Referring now to figures 3 and 4 of the drawings, a construction of inner member for a tripode joint is shown which has a shaft component 30 with an end portion 31 cold formed to present axially a three limbed recess 32. In the recess 32 is received an assembly 33 of three arm components 34 secured together. The assembly 33 is held in the recess in part 31 by welding and or by clenching over the end parts 35 of the wall bounding recess 32. One of the arm components 34 is shown in figure 4. This is of cylindrical form with one end having two chamfers 36 so arranged that three of the components will fit together to form the assembly 33. The components may simply be made from steel bar of appropriate grade. The components 34 are held together to form the assembly 33 by welding at 37. The production of the inner joint member of figures 3 and 4 involves a relatively uncomplicated cold forming operation to form the end 31 of shaft component 30, and the production and securing together of arm components 34 followed by their attachment to the shaft component. Arm components 34 can readily be made on automated machinery and can be finish machined before being secured together. In comparison, the forging techniques used for making inner joint members hitherto are more complex. As for the embodiment of figures 1 and 2, the splined connection between shaft and inner joint member is avoided. A further advantage possible with the invention is that the arms could be headed and assembled with their rollers before being secured together on to the inner joint member, thus avoiding circlips, retaining washers or like components for holding the rollers on the arms.
