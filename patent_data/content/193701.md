## Description
The present invention relates to a method of carrying γ alumina by a porous ceramics structure. More specifically, the invention is concerned with a method for carrying γ alumina by a porous ceramics structure which is used as a catalyst carrier in an exhaust gas cleaning device for an automotive internal combustion engine or as a fine particle trapping carrier for trapping fine carbon particles in the exhaust gas from an automotive internal combustion engine. In a typical conventional method for carrying γ alumina by porous ceramics structure, the porous ceramics structure is immersed in a colloidal ceramics slurry containing alumina. The ceramics structure is then dried and fired so that the γ alumina is carried by the skeletal surfaces of the porous ceramics structure. According to this conventional method, the γ alumina is carried on the skeletal surface of the porous ceramics structure in the form of a plain thick layer, so that the skeletal surface becomes too smooth to improve the contact between the γ alumina and a gas to be treated. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the invention to provide a method of carrying γ alumina by a porous ceramics structure, capable of overcoming the above described problems of the prior art. In other words, the object of the invention is to provide a method of carrying γ alumina by a porous ceramics structure which can enhance the contact between the gas to be treated and the γ alumina carried by the skeletal surface of the porous ceramics structure. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for carrying γ alumina on a porous ceramics structure, including a method of producing γ alumina carried by the skeletal surface of the porous ceramics structure. The method of the invention is entirely novel over the conventional method which relies upon immersion of a porous ceramics structure in the alumina slurry. According to the invention, fine particles of γ alumina carried by a carrier gas are made to flow through a porous ceramics structure together with the carrier gas, so as to cause deposition of the fine particles of the γ alumina on the skeletal surface of the porous ceramics structure which deposition occurs in three dimensional and columnar form. A description will be made first as to an apparatus which is suitable for use in carrying out the method of the invention. Referring to Fig. 1, a crucible 5 of a heat resistant ceramics material is disposed in a cylindrical, hermetically sealed container 1. A heater coil 11 arranged around the crucible 5 heats the crucible 5 up to a temperature which is high enough to melt aluminum in the crucible 5. The aluminum is molten at a temperature ranging between 800 and 900 C, and the power supply to the heater coil 11 is controlled to maintain the crucible 5 in this temperature range. An electrode 12 made of a heat resistant alloy or carbon is immersed in the molten aluminum within the crucible 5. At the same time, an aluminum electrode 6 is supported by a suitable supporting device at a suitable distance, e.g., 2 to 3 mm, from the surface of the molten aluminum. The electrode 6 and the electrode 12 are connected to a power supply 13 through a variable resistor 14 as illustrated. The hermetically sealed vessel 1 is connected at its inlet end to an introduction pipe 2 through a magnet valve 3. An air or a mixture gas consisting of argon and oxygen, having oxygen content of 5 to 10 , is introduced into the hermetically sealed vessel 1 through the introduction pipe 2. The pipe 2 is connected to tanks which supplies above mentioned gases. The hermetically sealed vessel also is connected at its inlet end to an exhaust pipe 15 through a magnet valve 10. A cylindrical portion 101 for accommodating a porous ceramics structure 7 is formed in the outlet portion of the vessel 1. A heater coil 9 is disposed around the cylindrical, outer peripheral portion 101. Although not shown, the cylindrical portion 101 is provided with an window which is adapted to be opened and closed for allowing the porous ceramics structure to be removed out of the cylindrical portion 101. A description will be made hereinunder as to an example of the porous ceramics structure 7. Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, the porous ceramics structure has a multiplicity of inlet passages 7a and outlet passages 7b which are spaced from each other by means of porous partition walls 7c. The porous ceramics structure as a whole has an outside diameter of 107 mm and a length of 78 mm, and each passage has an inside diameter of 2 to 3 mm. There are 50 fifty passages in total. This porous ceramics structure can be formed by a method which is disclosed in U.S. Continuation in Part Appln. of HIRAYAMA et al. Serial No. 725,510 US A 475,745, now abondoned, 1983.3.16 . As will be seen from Fig. 3, the porous partition wall 7c has a three dimensional network skeleton 70 and pores 71 defined by the skeleton 70. This porous ceramics structure is formed from cordierite. An embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention will be described hereinunder. Referring first to Fig. 1, a voltage of 30 V is applied between the electrodes 6 and 12 such that an electric current of 10 to 100 A flow therebetween, thereby causing an arc discharge between the surface of the molten aluminum and the electrode 6. On the other hand, a valve 3 and a valve 10 are opened so that a mixture gas mainly consisting of argon and oxygen is introduced into the hermetically sealed container at a flowing velocity of 0.5 m sec. By the arc discharge explained above, the molten aluminum is evaporated and the vapor of the aluminum is brought into contact with the argon oxygen mixture gas, so that the aluminum vapor is oxidized to become γ alumina ultra fine particles having particle sizes of about 0.05 µm. The thus formed ultra fine γ alumina particles are brought to the cylindrical portion 101 of the outlet side of the vessel 1, accompanying the flow of the carrier gas mentioned before. Then, the carrier gas is introduced into the inlet passages 7a of the porous ceramics structure and come into the outlet passages 7b through the pores formed in the partition walls 7c, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2. Thus, the carrier gas flows through the pores 71 in the three dimensional network like skeleton 70. The ultra fine γ alumina particles are made to collide with the skeleton 70 to be trapped by and deposited on the surface of the skeleton 70. The porous ceramics structure thus having ultra fine alumina particles deposited thereon is then heated at about 1200 to 1300 C for about one hour by means of a heater coil 9, so that the ultra fine alumina particles are fixed onto the skeletal surface. The carrier gas emerging from the porous ceramics structure is exhausted through the exhaust pipe 15. According to the invention, ultra fine particles 16 of γ alumina are deposited in a three dimensional porous or columnar porous state on the surface of the above mentioned skeletal surface 70. In consequence, the contact between the treated gas and the γ alumina can be achieved at a high efficiency. Preferably, a film of, for example, cordierite is formed on the porous ceramics structure as indicated by a numeral 17 in Fig. 4, prior to the deposition of γ alumina ultra fine particles. This can be achieved by preparing a cordierite bath which contains, by weight percent with respect to the weight of cordierite, 5 to 10 of polyvinyl alcohol, 2 to 3 t of surfactant and dispersing agent, and 50 to 100 of water, immersing the porous ceramics structure in the cordierite bath, and drying the same at 500 to 800 C followed by firing at 1100 to 1300 c for 70 hours. With this method, it is possible to prevent the ultra fine particles 16 from coming into the pores opening in the surface of the skeleton 70, thus preventing wasteful use of the ultra fine alumina particles 16. For carrying a catalyst by the porous ceramics structure on which ultra fine particles of γ alumina are deposited, a solution containing a catalyst is atomized by a spray and applied to the structure while the latter is maintained at a temperature between 500 and 600 C. An explanation will be made hereiundner as to the results of experiments which were conducted for the purpose of comparison between the method of the invention and the conventional method in the performance. Using the method of the invention described before, ultra fine alumina particles particle size about 0.1 µm to 1 µm were deposited on the skeletal surfaces of a porous ceramics structure as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 which was formed in accordance with the method disclosed in US A 725,510 mentioned before. The amount of deposition was about 150 g for each structure. The structure had an outside diameter of 107 mm, length of 78 mm and a volume of about 700 cc., while the number of each of the inlet and outlet passage was 50 fifty in total. Each passage had an inside diameter of 2 mm and a wall thickness of 2 mm. A slurry was prepared by mixing, by weight percent with respect to the amount of γ alumina particles of about 3 µm in size, 10 to 20 of alumina sol, 20 to 30 of aluminum nitrate, 50 to 60 of colloidal silica and 100 to 150 of water. The porous ceramics structure, which was formed by the method disclosed in US A 725,510 and having the same size as the structure used in the method of the invention, was immersed in the slurry and, after removal of excessive slurry, the porous ceramics structure was fired for one hour at a temperature of between 500 and 1000 c, thereby forming a γ alumina layer of about 150 g in weight on the skeletal surface of the porous ceramics structure. The following method was used in carrying a catalyst metal both on the porous ceramics structure treated by the method of the invention and the porous ceramics structure treated by the conventional method. An aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid H₂PtCℓ₁₆ 6H₂O and rhodium chloride RhCℓ₁₃ 3H₂O was prepared such that the ratio of weight between the chloroplatinic acid and rhodium chloride ranges between 5 1 in terms of the weight of platinum and rhodium Pt Rh , and that the total weight of the chloroplatinic acid and the rhodium chloride is in a range of 1 to 3 wt of the whole solution. The porous ceramic structures were immersed in this aqueous solution and, after a slight drainage, dried at a temperature ranging between 100 and 120 C. Consequently, a catalytic metal consisting of Pt Rh is carried by the surfaces of the γ alumina on the porous ceramics structure. The catalytic metal is denoted by a numeral 18 in Fig. 4 which shows the structure treated by the method of the invention. The porous ceramics structure carrying catalytic metal was mounted in an exhaust pipe of an automobile COLLORA manufactured by TOYOTA, and was subjected to a test known as 10 mode running pattern test specified by a regulation laid by Ministry of Transportation of Japan. The result of measurement of the exhaust gas cleaning effect throughout this test are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows only the effect of removal of NOx. The results of measurements of cleaning effects on CO and HC are omitted, because they showed almost the same tendency as the effect on NOx. From Fig. 5, it will be clearly understood that the porous ceramics structure in accordance with the invention has much higher NOx removing effect than the porous ceramics structure treated by the conventional method and having the same amount of catalyst metal. This proves that the efficiency of contact between the γ alumina and the exhaust gas is higher in the structure treated by the method of the invention than in the structure treated by the conventional method. It will be understood also that the method of the invention permits a remarkable reduction in the consumption of the catalyst metal as compared with the conventional method. Porous ceramics structures were prepared by the same method as in Experiment 1. The structure had an outside diameter of 107 mm, length of 130 mm and a volume of 1170 c.c. There were 89 eighty nine inlet passages and 88 eighty eight outlet passages each having an inside diameter of 3 mm. The thickness of the partition wall also was 3 mm. Each porous ceramics structure carried about 200 g of γ alumina. A porous ceramics structure fabricated by the method disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 725,510 was used. The sizes of this structure were identical to those of the structure treated by the method of the invention mentioned above. The porous ceramics structure treated by the method of the invention and that terated by the conventional method were subjected to a test for measurement of the efficiency of trapping diesel particulates. The test was conducted by mounting the structures in the exhaust pipe of a TOYOTA s 2600 c.c. diesel engine for passenger car CROWN, and measuring the effect of trapping of diesel particulates after 3 hours running at 2000 r.p.m. The result of measurement is shown in Fig. 6. In this Figure, the term mesh is used to mean the total number of pores in the porous ceramics structure as counted per inch when the pores are arrayed in a line. From Fig. 6, it will be seen that the porous ceramics structure of the invention provides a higher diesel particulate trapping efficiency as compared with the conventional method. The γ alumina used in the method of the invention can be formed by various methods, e.g., by hydrolysis in water or by evaporation in a gas. It is to be noted also that the invention is applicable also to the carriage of catalyst on an ordinary monolithic structure which is known per se.
