# In Line coagulation process for fluoroelastomer emulsions.

## Abstract
In line continuous coagulation and agglomeration of fluoroelastomers produced by emulsion polymerization per mits direct processing of fluoroelastomer latex into mecha nical dewatering devices. Coagulant is injected into the fluoroelastomer latex countercurrent and under high press ure atomization and residence time prior to mechanical dewatering is controlled.
