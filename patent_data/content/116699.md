# Method and generator for superposing graphic patterns.

## Abstract
A method for superposing one graphic pattern on another graphic pattern wherein the graphics are repre sented and generated electrically by rectangular arrays of digital signals corresponding to dot raster patterns to be printed or displayed. One graphic is a superior dominant graphic 71 while a second graphic is an inferior or recessive graphic 72 . A computer is programmed to process the digital signals for producing dominant graphic contoured intermediate arrays for masking the array of the inferior graphic to produce a partial or fragmented array 73 . The partial array is DOT ORed with the dominant graphic array to produce a pattern 75 of superposed graphics separated by a background space contoured to the dominant graphic pattern.
