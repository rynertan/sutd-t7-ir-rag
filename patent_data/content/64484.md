# Method for fluorescence spectroscopic determination of a biologically active substance.

## Abstract
In a method for fluorescence spectroscopic determina tion of a biological substance provided with a marker consisting of a lantanide chelate complex formed by a lantanide coupled to the substance via a chelate forming compound, such as an EDTA analogue, the lantanide ion or the complete chelate before the detection is split from the active substance for instance by adding a buffer with a pH value below 3.5 and a splitting detergent, whereafter the excitation in the determination takes place in the solution by using a short radiation pulse and the fluorescence from the marker is detected when the fluorescence from the noise sources has substantially ceased.
