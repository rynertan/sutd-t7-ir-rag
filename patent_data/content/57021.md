# Color imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a color imaging apparatus having a plurality of image pickup tubes 13, 14, 15 which pick up respective optical images of primary colors decom posed from one optical image, and provides a color imaging apparatus holding a picture of high quality at all times in such a way that the registration of the images of the respective image pickup tubes is performed even during the operation of the camera. To this end, among image signals, local image signals which satisfy predetermined requisites being the most favorable for the reference signals of the registration are selected by decision circuits 91, 92, 93 and are temporarily stored in a memory 94 so as to be used for the registration. The most favorable requisites of the image are thus achieved, namely no movement is involved, the contour is sharp, and the chroma is low.
