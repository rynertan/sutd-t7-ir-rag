# Recombinant DNA and coliform bacillus having genetic material for the production of staphylokinase, and the production of staphylokinase.

## Abstract
Novel recombinant DNA and a coliform bacillus are provided which are useful for the industrial production of staphylokinase, a fibrinolytic enzyme. A process is provided for the production of staphylokinase by cultivating the bacillus. A host coliform bacillus has a vector introduced into its phenotypycally expressible genotype, which vector re combinant DNA carrying genetic information encoded for the production of staphylokinase has been inserted, said DNA being derived from digestion of temperate phage DNA of Staphylococcus aureus.
