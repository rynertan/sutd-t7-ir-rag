# Wavesoldering device, particularly for printed circuits.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for soldering the compo nents on printed circuits, of the type for carrying out so called wavesoldering. As claimed in the invention, the printed circuits are fed in a feed direction that coincides with the machine s main axis, and the soldering wave is produced in such a manner that, on the one hand, its main dimension is oblique in relation to the said feed direction and or, on the other hand, it is subject to an orbital or alternative movement in the direction of its said main dimension.

## Description
It is a well known fact that with the evolution of electronics the dimensions of the separate elements tend to become more and more reduced. Printed circuits are also subject to this tendency, and hence there is an increase in the number of components mounted on each unit of surface of the printed circuit. At the same time, there is also a tendency to mount the components on both sides of the printed circuit, and no longer on just one side.One of the biggest problems in this compact mounting is the soldering of the components onto the printed circuit. It is a known fact that, for this purpose, nowadays the wavesoldering techique represents the best means to obtain a safe soldering with high productivity and a high degree of automation.At present a wavesoldering device comprises at least the following parts fluxing unit drying unit preheating unit wavesoldering well transporterBoth the transporter, the function of which is obviously to transport the printed circuits over the device and particularly over the wavesoldering well, and the fluxing, drying and preheating units, have structures that are well known to an expert in this field and therefore will not be described in detail now, especially considering that the invention does not relate to these parts so much, but more precisely to the wavesoldering well.Fundamentally, the wavesoldering well consists of a tank containing the solder, which is maintained in a fluid state, at a constant temperature, by means of heating resistances that are perfectly controlled thermostatically. The tank also comprises a conveyance duct ending in a slot shaped nozzle that protrudes slightly above the level of the solder bath. A pump immerged in this bath creates a flow of solder from the tank towards the said duct, such that the solder comes out of the slot shaped nozzle to fall back into the bath forming a wave, that is lengthened out in the same direction as the length of the nozzle.There are various types of wavesoldering wells on sale, which are capable of forming different types of waves, and a more detailed description of this known technique may be found in relevant pubblications, such as for example, ASSEMBLAGGIOELETTRONICO by Giovanni LEONIDDA, 1978 edition, EditorialeDelfino. A common characteristic of all these different types of wells is that the length of the slot of the slot shaped nozzle which as has already been stated, determines the main dimension of the solder wave is pointed perpendicularly to the main axis of the soldering machine, in other words, in the feed direction of the printed circuits along the machine.The printed circuits are fed along the machine with their surfaces laying horizontally, or in other words, parallel to the level of the solder bath, or more precisely, slightly slanted in the manner illustrated in fig. 1, and at such a height that their lower face comes into contact with the crest of the wave, which thus solders the metallic parts.This technique has always proved to be perfectly effective as long as the soldering to be done was on the metallic parts of the printed circuit s lower face, of filiform terminals protruding from the said metallic parts. However, with the soldering of components for example the so called chips on the said lower face, and particularly with the soldering of very dense components, serious difficulties have been met.To be precise, it was found that the said components were soldered correctly on their front face side seen in relation to the feed direction of the circuit whilst on their back face, soldering was either incomplete or completely inexistent. This well known phenomenon currently referred to as dry soldering , to indicate the fact that some metallic parts of the printed circuit are not bathed by the solder is illustrated better by referring to the diagram in fig. 1.This fig. shows the diagram of a printed circuit C, which is being fed, slightly slanted in the sense that its front edge is higher than the back one, in respect to the level of the bath , in direction F, and the lower face of which is lapped by a soldering wave S it can be seen from this drawing that, whilst the front face H of each componentH and the metallic part C of the printed circuit right next ot it, are completely bathed by the solder, the wave S does not reach the back face H and the metallic part C next to it. This is mainly due to the feeding movement of the printed circuit, which ends up creating a back area that cannot be reached by the solder, on the one hand because of the solder s surface tension, and on the other due to the fact that the accumulation of gases developed by the flux is highly favoured in this area.Fig. 1 illustrates a printed circuit which only has two components applicated onto its lower face, which are spaced out quite alot from one another in case of more components, and which are perhaps denser as well, as dictated by modern electronics, the dry soldering phenomenon is even more noticeable and damaging.In order to avoid this phenomenon, several different artifices have already been tried, for example, as is partially illustrated in fig. 1 by slanting the printed circuit, in other words with its back part lower than its front, so that contact with the wave s 5crest is more persistent by provoking the formation of a double wave and hence double contact between the solder and the printed circuit, or by immerging the printed circuit directly into the solder bath, or even by forming a proper jet of solder directed against the lower face of the printed circuit.However, generally speaking it has not been possible to completely eliminate the aforementioned dry soldering phenomenon, whilst on the other hand, the printed circuits have been subjected and especially the single components to a longer period of heating, which is notoriously damaging to the components themselves. Another technique, even more recent, consists in generating dry azote bubbles and making them bubble inside the solder and towards the contact area between the printed circuit and the solder. Due to the kinetic energy accumulated during their rise towards the surface of the bath and their different specific weight, these bubbles disperse the fluxing gases created during the soldering phase by moving them, and therefore facilitate bathing of the component s back face.However, as can easily be understood, this technique is rather complex and relatively expensive furthermore, its effectiveness is not always uniform, as the action of the azote bubbles that move the gasseous flux is purely casual, or at least cannot be repeated in a sufficiently constant manner. The invention as claimed is intended to solve the problem of realizing a device that makes it possible to carry out correct soldering of the components applicated, even very densely, onto the lower face of a printed circuit, in a simple manner, thus completely avoiding the so called dry soldering phenomenon. This result is obtained, in a machine of the general type described above, by proceeding in such a manner that the soldering wave of the soldering well, lengthened out along one of its main dimensions, is produced with its said main dimension pointed obliquely in relation to the general alignment of the front faces, which are being fed forward, of the components to be soldered onto the printed circuit.A further claim of the invention consists in a device for carrying out the procedure described, of the type comprising means to transport the printed circuits in the said feed direction, and a wavesoldering well, with a slot shaped nozzle for forming the wave, characterised in that the said slot shaped nozzle is placed obliquely in relation to the alignment of the front faces of the components and or has an orbital or alternative movement along its main dimension.Further characteristics and advantages offered by the present invention will be made more evident by the description given below of a preferred embodiment of it, an example of which is illustrated in the enclosed drawings in which Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the known technique, in accordance with the description given above.Figs. 2 and 3 schematically illustrate the plan and cross section of a wavesoldering well according to the present invention.Fig. 4 illustrates in a plan and a corrisponding graph, the impact section in a wavesoldering well of the known type.And fig. 5 is a similar view to fig. 4, for a wavesoldering well made according to the present invention.As has already been described, fig. 1 represents what happens when wavesoldering is carried out according to the known technique, on the lower face of a printed circuit C, onto which components H, for example chips, are applicated. Figure 4 illustrates this situation even more clearly by showing the plan of the component H which is being fed in the direction indicated by the letter F when the said component H meets the soldering wave S, the impact section as the graph in the said fig. shows, in which the ordinates represent the impact section SEZ and the abscissae represent the time T instantly passes from a nil value to a maximum value.The opposite happens in the instant that the component leaves the wave, so that the impact section instantly passes from a maximum value to a nil value it is in relation to this that the dry soldering phenomenon described at the beginning of the present description occurs.As figs. 2 and 3 illustrate, the device made according to the present invention comprises a well 1 containing solder, maintained in a fluid state and at a controlled temperature by means of heating resistances not shown, in as much as they are of a known type .Inside the well 1 there is a duct 2 in which the solder flows in a known manner, from the bottom upwards, to form a wave at the top which falls back into the well 1. According to the invention, the slot shaped nozzle 3 which is to form the wave is made with its main dimension X X pointed obliquely in relation to the feed direction Y Y of the printed circuits.As the front faces, that are being fed forward, of the components fixed onto the printed circuit are normally pointed perpendicularly to the feed direction Y Y, the said main dimension X X of the slot shaped nozzle is thus also obliquely placed in relation to the said front faces of the components.As fig. 5 illustrates, this arrangement makes the impact section of the component H, which is being fed forward, with the soldering wave, increase in a progressive manner, and diminish in an equally progressive manner. Therefore the component faces the wave in a gradual manner, thus giving it the possibility to cover it as much as possible furthermore, the fluxing gases have time to escape progressively from the sides, without getting trapped behind the components and so prevent correct soldering.Furthermore, again according to the invention, the slot shaped nozzle 3 is made out of one piece 4, which covers the top of the duct 2 like a cap. The piece 4 is mounted to slide sideways, in other words perpendicularly to the direction Y Y and is associated to a connecting rod 5 and handle 6 mechanism designed to give it an alternative movement, and to be precise that is perpendicular to the direction Y Y. With modest construction variations it would be possible to also cause an alternative movement in the direction of the axis X X of the nozzle slot, or even an orbital movement.This latter arrangement in its turn produces two more favourable effects in fact it creates a state of permanent instability in the wave s mass, and the forces going against the component s feed movement besides being reduced to a minimum, due to what has just been described above vary continuously, so that infiltration of the solder between the components is facilitated, and the gases are forced out.It is understood however, that the invention is not limited only to the specific embodiment described and illustrated herein, but that there can be multiple variations of the same. In particular, it must be stated that the oblique soldering wave could be doubled, and each of the two waves could be inclined differently in relation to the feed direction of the printed circuits, or the two waves could even have opposite inclinations to one another. In these cases the vibrations of the two waves could be syncronized or in some way differentiated. It must, on the other hand, be pointed out that the same result could be obtained by directing the soldering wave in such a manner that its largest dimension is perpendicular to the feed direction of the printed circuits and then feeding the printed circuits obliquely in relation to the said feed direction. The fundamental thing, in as far as the present invention is concerned, is that the front faces of the components mounted on the printed circuits are pointed obliquely in relation to the largest dimension of the soldering wave.
