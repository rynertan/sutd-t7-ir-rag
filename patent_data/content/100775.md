# Wing leading edge slat.

## Abstract
A chordwise extensible wing leading edge system incorporating a rigid contoured panel member 22 which is exposed during forward extension movement of the leading edge slat 21 for closing in the proximity area between said slat and the relatively stationary leading edge portion of the wing 20 , as a function of the forward movement of the slat 21 . A further embodiment utilizes a second panel member 32 so that both the upper and the lower surface contour of the wing airfoil envelope are aerodynamically continuous to complete the contour of the intervening space between the extended position of the slat and the stationary portion of the wing whereby, this combination results in approaching the merits of wing cambering devices capable of operation at relatively high airspeeds as opposed to landing or take off airspeeds.
