# METHOD FOR BONDING CERAMICS AND METALS

## Abstract
A method for bonding Si₃N₄ or SiC ceramics with metals which comprises the steps of depositing, on the ceramic mat erial, an insert material consisting of a mixture of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ni and Cu and at least one member selected from the group consisting of metal oxides, nitrides and carbides by ion plating or spray coating, subjecting the deposited insert material to thermal reaction treatment to permit metallurgical bond between the insert material and the ceramic material, and bonding a metal member to the surface of the insert material by brazing with a brazing material whose melting point is lower than the insert material or by diffusion welding at a temperature lower than a melting point of the insert material.
