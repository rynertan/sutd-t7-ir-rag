# Method for making aromatic ethers and catalyst used in such method.

## Abstract
A method is provided for making aromatic ethers by effecting the displacement of reactive radicals on an acti vated aromatic nucleus such as a phthalimide with a mono or bisalkali metal phenoxide in the presence of an organic solvent and a dialkylamino branched alkyl substituted pyridi nium salt as a phase transfer catalyst. Improved yields of bis aromatic ethers are achieved without the production of undesirable by products, such as akylated phenols.
