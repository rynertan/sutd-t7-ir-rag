## Description
This invention relates to a protected MOS transistor circuit, and more particularly to a MOS transistor integrated circuit which includes a circuit for obviating damage to the gate oxide of an MOS transistor when power is off. It has been known that a relatively high potential applied to the gate of a MOS transistor causes breakdown of the gate oxide. This results in a permanent electrical short between the gate and the substrate on which the MOS transistor is formed, thereby destroying the MOS transistor. The gate oxide breaks down when the field strength across the gate, which is normally silicon dioxide, is more than approximately 10⁷V cm. Thus, for example, if 80 100V is applied across a 80 100nm 800 1000 Angstrom thick gate oxide, rupture occurs. Hereinafter, the voltage at which rupture occurs is referred to as the dielectric breakdown voltage . Therefore, a protective input circuit, which provides a voltage limiting function, is usually placed at each of the signal input terminals of a MOS transistor integrated circuit chip MOS IC chip connected to a MOS transistor gate. Various kinds of protective input circuits have been used as shown, for example, at pp. 96 101 in These protective input circuits utilize either the breakdown voltage of a zener diode or the high threshold voltage of a thick oxide MOS transistor to provide protection. The protective voltage i.e. the breakdown voltage of the zener diode or the high threshold voltage of the thick oxide MOS transistor is set to be lower than the dielectric breakdown voltage at which the gate oxide ruptures. Despite these protective input circuits, ruptures occur during handling shipping, testing, circuit board assembly, etc. , especially in large scale integrated LSI circuits, due to current surges. This problem has become more significant due to the fact that gate oxide layers have become thinner e.g., 30 50 nm 300 500 Angstrom as the density of elements in integrated circuits has increased. Thus, the dielectric breakdown voltage has become lower as the gate oxide has become thinner and as a result, the dielectric breakdown voltage has become approximately equal to or occasionally lower than the protective voltage. Further, even if the dielectric breakdown voltage is higher than the protective voltage, rupture of the gate oxide often occurs, because the protective zener diode or thick oxide MOS transistor does not respond promptly when excessive current surges occur at the signal input terminals. Therefore rupture of the gate oxide takes place before the protective zener diode or thick oxide MOS transistor becomes conductive. The slow response of the protective zener diode or thick oxide MOS transistors also occasionally results in rupture of the zener diode or the thick oxide MOS transistor itself. The rupture problem occurs not only with input MOS transistors but also with output MOS transistors. Furthermore, the rupture problem occurs in handling much more when power is off than when power is on. In fact, the rupture problem seldom occurs when power is on. Therefore, a need exists for a protective circuit for an MOS transistor circuit which can protect an MOS transistor from rupture caused by excessive current surges, especially during handling when power is off. An alternative approach to this problem is exemplified by Japanese patent application no. 55 70071 which discloses a protective circuit for a circuit including at least one MOS transistor 4 of the kind having a region which is susceptible to damage caused by the accidental application of stray voltages to a terminal 1 of the MOS transistor 4 when the said MOS transistor 4 is not in operation, the protective circuit including a device 10 connected to the said terminal 1 and having a first state, when power is on i.e. when the said MOS transistor is used , in which energy is not absorbed via the device, and a second state, when power is off, i.e. when said MOS transistor is not used in which energy of the stray voltages is absorbed via the said device 10 . Accordingly, this invention seeks to provide an improved MOS transistor protective circuit, which is suitable for integration. This invention further seeks to provide an improved protected MOS transistor circuit in which the gate oxide of an input MOS transistor is protected from rupture caused by excessive current surges when power is off, and in which an output MOS transistor is preferably also protected from such excessive current surges. According to the invention, there is provided an integrated circuit including at least one first MOS transistor TrI having a region which is susceptible to damage caused by the accidental application of stray voltages to a terminal of the MOS transistor when power is off, the protective circuit including a a second, depletion mode MOS transistor Trp having a source drain path connected between the said terminal and a reference voltage Vss and being arranged to conduct when power is off and to be non conductive when power is on, characterised by a circuit 20 which generates a substrate bias voltage when power is on, which voltage is applied to the substrate of said integrated circuit and is also applied to said gate of said second MOS transistor to render it non conductive. The invention also extends to an integrated MOS circuit including such a protective circuit. The protective circuit may be employed at the input or the output of an MOS transistor circuit. Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 illustrates an MOS transistor and protective circuit according to a typical embodiment of this invention, which is formed as an MOS transistor IC chip. The MOS transistor and protective circuit includes an input MOS transistor circuit 1 and a protective means such as circuit 10. Input MOS transistor circuit 1 may be, for example, an inverter circuit which includes an N channel type depletion mode MOS transistor TrL as a load and an N channel type enhancement mode MOS transistor TrI as a driver. MOS transistor TrL has a drain connected to one positive voltage level V Protective circuit 10 includes an N channel type, depletion mode MOS transistor TrP. Transistor TrP has a drain connected at a first terminal 11 to the gate of input MOS transistor TrI, a source connected at a second terminal 12 to the reference voltage level V When power is off i.e., when no power is supplied to the integrated circuit in which the MOS transistor circuit is formed , for example, in shipping, control signal V When power is on i.e., when power is supplied to the integrated circuit in which the MOS transistor circuit is formed , the circuit is in ordinary operation and control signal V The value of control signal V Since V It should be noted that excessive current surges which may cause rupture of the gate oxide of input MOS transistor TrI generally occur when power is off and seldom, if ever occur when power is on. Accordingly, rupture of the gate oxide of input MOS transistor TrP can be substantially avoided when the gate oxide is sufficiently protected when power is off. In the embodiment of FIGURE 1, the gate oxide of input MOS transistor TrI is sufficiently protected when power is off because protective circuit 10 connects the gate of MOS transistor TrI to one reference voltage level V Further, a p n junction i.e. a zener diode is naturally formed between the drain of protective MOS transistor TrP and the substrate on which the MOS transistor circuit is formed. Therefore rupture due to current surges is also protected by breakdown of this p n junction. Thus, as is apparent to those skilled in the art, transistor TrP is employed to absorb energy. The capacitance of its substrate is large, and in fact much larger than the capacitance of the source of the surge, typically a human body most likely, the surge is caused by someone touching the input terminal . Therefore, the voltage that develops at the gate of transistor TrI is relativly small when transistor TrP conducts. When transistor TrP does not conduct, the capacitance of a substrate is relatively small and thus transistor TrP does not absorb substantial energy, and thus does not affect the circuit. A conventional protective input circuit as shown, for example, on pp. 96 101 of Control signal V Figure 2 shows one example of a control signal generating circuit suitable for generating V The control signal generating circuit 2 has fundamentally the same structure as the known substrate voltage generating circuit which is also shown by numeral 20 in Figure 2. That is, the control signal generating circuit 2 comprises an oscillation circuit 21, a capacitor C₂, an N channel type enhancement mode MOS transistor Tr21 employed as a rectification circuit, and another N channel type enhancement mode MOS transistor Tr22 employed as a rectification circuit. The oscillation circuit 21 comprises, for example, three inverters 211, 212 and 213 connected in series with the output terminal of inverter 213 connected to the input terminal of inverter 211. The output terminal of inverter 213 is also connected to one terminal of capacitor C₂. The other terminal of capacitor C₂ is connected to the drain and gate of transistor Tr21, the source of which is connected to one reference voltage level V The substrate voltage generating circuit 20 comprises the oscillation circuit 21 shared with the control signal generating circuit 2 in this embodiment, a capacitor C₂₀, an N channel type enhancement mode MOS transistor Tr201 employed as a rectification circuit, and another N channel type enhancement mode MOS transistor Tr202 employed as a rectification circuit. The output terminal of oscillation circuit 21 is connected to one terminal of the capacitor C₂₀. The other terminal of capacitor C₂₀ is connected to the drain and gate of transistor Tr201, the source of which is connected to one reference voltage level V As is apparent from the above description, the substrate bias voltage V In MOS transistors the threshold voltage, V This suggests a manner of eliminating the control signal generating circuit 2 as long as substrate biasing circuit 20 is employed, and this embodiment is illustrated in FIGURE 2A. This embodiment does not form part of the present invention but is instead part of the copending application 85 102 555.1 EP A 0 168552 . In this embodiment the gate and source of transistor TrP are connected together. Transistor TrP must be the type of depletion mode transistor as described above whose threshold voltage V When power is off, the substrate voltage is 0, so V The embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 3 is different from the preceding embodiment because of the addition of a protective resistor R The difference between the embodiment of FIGURE 3 and the embodiment of FIGURE 4 is that protective circuit 10 in FIGURE 4 includes a changing circuit 40, and a switching MOS transistor TrS. The embodiment of FIGURE 4 has substantially the same arrangement and operation as that of FIGURE 3 in other respects. The same parts of the embodiment of FIGURE 4 as those of the embodiment of FIGURE 3 are denoted by the same numerals. Protective circuit 10 in this embodiment has a first terminal 11 connected to input terminal 100 through protective resistor R The gate of protective MOS transistor TrP is connected to a first terminal 41 of changing circuit 40. Changing circuit 40 has also a second terminal 42 which is connected to terminal 14 of protective circuit 10. Changing circuit 40 aids in changing the conductivity of protective MOS transistor TrP in accordance with the magnitude of the excessive current surges which occur at input terminal 100. Changing circuit 40 includes a capacitor C When excessive current surges occur at input terminal 100 when power is off, the voltage potential at terminal 14 of changing circuit 40 changes in response thereto. Then the voltage potential on the gate of protective MOS transistor TrP also changes because of capacitor C It is needless to say that the value of capacitor C Switching MOS transistor TrS is connected between the gate of protective MOS transistor TrP and terminal 13 of protective circuit 10 to ensure that changing circuit 40 works efficiently and so that the value of capacitor C In the embodiment of FIGURE 4, it is apparent from the above description that the gate oxide of input MOS transistor TrI is sufficiently protected when power is off because protective circuit 10 functions to connect the gate of the input MOS transistor TrI to one reference voltage level V As is readily apparent from the Figures, the difference between the embodiment of FIGURE 4 and the embodiment of FIGURE 5A is the addition of MOS transistor TrC to changing circuit 40. Otherwise, the embodiment of FIGURE 5A has substantially the same arrangement and operation as that of FIGURE 4, and therefore the same parts of the embodiment of FIGURE 5A as those of the embodiment of FIGURE 4 are denoted by the same numerals, and description thereof is omitted. MOS transistor TrC is connected in parallel with capacitor C When power is off, protective MOS transistor TrP is conductive because transistor TrP is of the depletion mode. If excessive current surges occur at input terminal 100 when power is off, the surges are discharged rapidly through the source drain current path of protective MOS transistor TrP. At this time, the conductivity of transistor TrP becomes large because current flowing through both capacitor C Therefore, the conductivity of protective MOS transistor TrP is kept large when power is off, even though surges may continue for a long time. As a result, surges are discharged much more quickly and easily through the source drain current path, the conductivity of which is kept large, even if the surges continues for a long time at power off. Accordingly, the gate of input MOS transistor TrI is much more effectively protected from rupture. When power is on, switching MOS transistor TrS is conductive and the control voltage V At this time, the MOS transistor TrC should not be conductive, either. Therefore threshold voltage V When the threshold voltage V In the embodiment of FIGURE 5A, it is apparent from the above description that the gate oxide of input MOS transistor TrI is sufficiently protected when power is off because protective circuit 10 functions to connect the gate of input MOS transistor TrI to one reference voltage level V Although changing circuit 40 comprises both the capacitor C In the embodiment of FIGURE 5A, only one MOS transistor TrC is connected between terminal 43 and terminal 44 of changing circuit 40. This need not be the case. Instead, a plurality of MOS transistors may be used in place of the single MOS transistor. FIGURE 5B shows a MOS transistor circuit with protective circuit 10 including a plurality of MOS transistors between terminal 43 and terminal 44 of changing circuit 40. Thus single MOS transistor TrC, used in the FIGURE 5A embodiment may be replaced by a plurality of MOS transistors TrC₁, TrC₂, , TrC Each of MOS transistors TrC₁, TrC₂, , TrC The source drain current paths of the MOS transistors TrC₁, TrC₂, , TrC When excessive current surges continue for a long time when power is off, the gate voltage level of the protective MOS transistor TrP is kept at a voltage level not less than V₁₅ is a voltage level greater than the surge level on terminal 15 of protective circuit 10. Further, the gate voltage level of protective MOS transistor TrP is brought to a higher voltage level, which makes the conductivity of the protective MOS transistor TrP larger, without making the threshold voltage V The respective threshold voltages V is a high voltage signal of the input Signal V As mentioned above, this invention provides an improved MOS transistor circuit with protective means for protecting the gate oxide of an input MOS transistor from rupture due to excessive current surges. This invention can be applied to an output MOS transistor circuit as well as an input MOS transistor circuit, as shown in Figure 6. An output MOS transistor circuit 6 generates an output signal V The source of transistor TrO₁ is connected to the drain of second output MOS transistor TrO₂. The source of transistor TrO₂ is connected to one reference voltage level V The drain of transistor TrO₂ is connected to one terminal of a protective resistor R Protective circuit 10 is connected between the drain of transistor TrO₂ and reference voltage V Protective circuit 10 used in FIGURE 6 has substantially the same arrangement and operation as that of FIGURE 1, so components of protective circuit 10 in FIGURE 6 are assigned the same reference numerals as corresponding components of protective circuit 10 of FIGURE 1, and description thereof is omitted. When power is off, a first terminal 11 of protective circuit 10 is effectively connected to a second terminal 12 of protective circuit 10 i.e., the drain of output MOS transistor TrO₂ is connected to reference voltage level V When power is on, terminal 11 of protective circuit 10 is disconnected from terminal 12 of protective circuit 10. Therefore the operation of output MOS transistor circuit 6 is not influenced by protective circuit 10. As is obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, protective circuit 10 may include changing circuit 40 as shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5A, or FIGURE 5B when used in conjunction with an output circuit as shown in FIGURE 6. Obviously, many modifications and variations of this invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, this invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
