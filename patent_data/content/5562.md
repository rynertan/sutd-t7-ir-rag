# PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, THEIR PREPARATION, AND USE AS CURING AGENTS FOR EPOXY RESINS

## Abstract
Phenolic curing agents, in particular for powder coatings, are prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol diphenylol propane , a diepoxide liquid diglycidyl ether of diphenylol propane , and a dicarboxylic acid adipic acid with the phenolic functionality in excess over the difference between the epoxy functionality and the acid functionality.
