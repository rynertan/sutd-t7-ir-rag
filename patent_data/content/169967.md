# ORIGINAL ANGLE SETTING DEVICE FOR SCANNER

## Abstract
As one aspect of the present invention, it is characterized in that a magnification measurement operation is effected with a magnification measurement apparatus and therefore a base line and an original setting line which are required for angle setting can be automatically depicted on a transparent film or a paper without requiring other operations. As another aspect of the present invention, there is provided angle setting device wherein an original holder member assembled in an automatic magnification measurement apparatus is rotatably provided, an original holding member for inserting an original into the original holder with the original being put thereinto is formed elongated thereby holding a plurality of original thereinto, and the original holding member is removably inserted into the original holder so that the former is displaced relative to the latter to effect each angle setting of a plurality of original in sucession. As a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for making original setting angle indica tion gauge, which comprises means operative to form a pulse signal corresponding to an inclined angle of a original, and means operative to input a predetermined side number indicating which side of a original has been measured and a predetermined output number indicating that the original is mounted to which portion of a sheet line gauge, thereby selecting one format from several formats determined in advance based on inputs of the both means and calculating the length of a line segment to be plotted and coordinates to plot on a sheet, setting line showing a position at which a original is mounted based on the calculated result in accordance with a selected format.
