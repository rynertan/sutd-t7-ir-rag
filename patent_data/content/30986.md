## Description
ABRESIVE CONTAINING, BUILT LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION Background The invention relates to liquid detergent c ompositions containing specified amounts and types of insoluble abrasives which are especially useful in the ashiny of dishes. The compositions also contain high sudsing surfactants and detergency builders which complement the action of the abrasive. The use of abrasives in powdered scouring cleansers is well known. Scouring cleansers generally contain a relatively high level of abrasive. When used in the dishwashing process such products provide abrading power to make the removal of clothed, burnt or dried on foods on kitchenware easier and more convenient. More recently, liquid scouring cleansers containing waterinsoluble abrasives have become available. Such liquid compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,149,078 3,210,285 3,210,286 3,214,380 3,579,456 3,623,990 3,677,954 3,813,349 and 3,966,432.The use of scouring cleansers, however, is normally in addition to a specific dishwashing product one product being required for removal of non sticking soils, especially fats and oils, and a second product being required fo scoring purposes. It is an object of the present invention to provide liquid dishwashing compositions containing a highsudsing surfactant, a detergency builder and an abrasive, the combination being highly effective in removing food soils from kitchenware when used undiluted or in the form of a relatively concentrated pater solution, but which is acceptable for hand dishwashing in the dilute water solutions typically used with liquid dishwashing products.

Particularly preferred anionic surfactants useful herein are alkyl ether sulfates having the formulaRO C2H4O xSO3M wherein R is alkyl or alkenyl of about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms, x is 1 to 30, and M is a water soluble cation. The alkyl ether sulfates useful in the present invention are condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols having about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms.

Nonionic surface active agents operable in the instant compositions can be any of three basic types the alkylene oxide condensates, the amldes and the semi polar nonionics. The alkylene oxide condensates are broadly defined as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups hydrophilic in nature with an organic hydrophob, compound, which can be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the hydrophilic or polyoxyalkylene radical which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. Examples of such alkylene oxide condensates include 1 The condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with ethylene oxide.

An example of a commercially available nonionic surfactant of this type includes Neodol 23 6.5 marketed by the ShellChemical Company. 2 The polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols. These compounds include the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 12 carbon atoms in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with ethylene oxide, the said ethylene oxide being present in amounts equal to 5 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol.The alkyl substituent in such compounds can be derived, for example, from polymerized propylene, diisobutylene, octene, or nonene.

The hydrophobic portion of these compounds has a molecular weight of from about 1500 to 1800 and of course exhibits water insolubility. The addition of polyoxyethylene moieties to this hydrophobic portion tends to increase the water solubility of the molecule as a whole, and the liquid character of the product is retained up to the point where the polyoxyethylene content is about 50 of the total weight of the condensation product. Examples of compounds of this type include certain of the commercially available Pluronic surfactants marketed by the Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation. a The condensation products of ethylene oxide with the product resulting form the reaction of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine. The hydrophobic base of these products consists of the reaction product of ethylene diamine and excess propylene oxide, said base having a molecular weight of from about 2500 to about 3000. This base is condensed with ethylene oxide to the extent that the condensation product contains from about 408 to about 80 by eight of polyoxyethylene and has a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 11,000. Examples of this type of nonionic surfactant include certain of the commercially available Tetronic compounds marketed by the Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation. Examples of the amide type of non ionic surface active agent include the ammonia, monoethanol and diethanol amides of fatty acids having an acyl moiety of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms. These acyl moieties are normally derived from naturally occurring glycerides, e.g., coconut oil, palm oil, soybean oil and tallow, but can be derived synthetically, e.g., by the oxidation of petroleum, or b hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer Tropsch process. Examples of the semi polar type of nonionic surface active agents are the amine oxides, phosphine oxides and sulfoxides. These materials are described more fully in Berry, U.S. Patent 3,819,528, issued June 25, 1974, incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred are amine oxides of the formula EMI9.1 wherein R1 is a Cl0 l8 alkyl and R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl. Ampholytic synthetic detergents can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic amines which contain a long chain of about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g. carboy, sulfo or sulfato. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3 dodecylamino propionate, sodium 3 dodecylamino propane sulfonate7 and dodecyl dimethylammonium hexanoate. Zwitterionic surface active agents operable in the instant composition are broadly described as internallyneutralized derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium and tertiary sulfonium compounds in which the aliphatic radical can be straight chain or branched, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfo, sulfato, phosphato, or phosphono. The level and type of surfactant used in the compositions of this invention provide an initial suds cover to a dishwashing solution and a suds cover after the washing of 8 plato tn r un . a concentration of 0.07 in 2 gallons of 1150F. water containing 7 yrains gallon water hardness measured as CaCO3, each plate carrying 4.0 ml of a triglyceride containing soil. Suds are generated by mechanical agitation and the suds cover and height measured. A dinner plate carrying the soil is washed successively with the introduction of 4.0 ml of soil each time. An essentially complete suds cover of the washing solution is more important than suds height, but, preferably, the suds cover after the washing of B plates is at least about 1 2 inch in height. The required sudsing characteristic of the compositions of the invention is that necessary to provide the user of the product with an indication of cleaning potential in a dishwashing solution. Soils encountered in dishwashing act as suds depressants and the presence or absence of suds from the surface of a dishwashing solution is a convenient guide to product usage. Mixtures of anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants, especially amides and amine oxide nonionic surfactants, are particularly preferred in the compositions of the invention because of their high sudsing characteristics, their suds stability in the presence of food soils and their ability to indicate accurately an adequate level of product usage in the presence of soil. A preferred ratio of anionic surfactants to nonionic surfactants is from about 2 1 to about 10 1 by weight. Cationic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium compounds can find optional use in the practice of the invention, particularly in compositions containing nonionic surfactants.
