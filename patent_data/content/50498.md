## Description
CATALYST COMPONENT, ITS PREPARATION AND USE IN POLYMERIZATION OF ALPHA OLEFINS This invention relates to catalyst components for polymerization of alpha olefins, their preparation use. More particularly, this invention relates to supported titanium catalyst components which can produce a polymer powder having a high bulk density at a high yield and a method for using them. Heretofore, where an olefin polymer, and especially polypropylene, is produced using a Ziegler Natta catalyst, many attempts have been made to obtain a catalyst having a high activity and exhibiting high stereoregularity, with the ultimate view of making the thus obtained polymer serviceable as a product without any further treatment. In recent years, supported catalysts based on titanium compounds supported on various supports, especially magnesium compounds, have been developed for the purpose of enhancing the polymerization capability per unit weight of titanium in a titanium component which is useful as a catalyst component, and accordingly good results are being acheived, but the ultimate catalyst has not yet been obtained. As regards supported catalysts utilizing a magnesium compound, especially magnesium chloride, as a support, in order to enhance the catalytic activity by increasing the active sites of the catalyst, many attempts have been made to pulverize the support into fine particles by mechanically grinding a mixture of magnesium chloride and other components. For example, there are known methods for preparing catalyst components, such as a method which comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an aromatic carboxylic acid ester and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with titanium tetrachloride Japanese PatentApplication Laid open No. 126590 1975 , a method which comprises cogrinding magnesium chloride and an aromatic carboxylic acid ester and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with a mixture or an addition reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and an acyl halide Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 17988 1979 , a method comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an acyl halide and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with a mixture or an addition reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and an ether Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 277 1978 etc. However, since any of these nethods prepares a catalyst component by grinding a support, there have been problems with the resulting catalyst component, i.e. it has a large content of fine powders, it shows a wide particle size distribution and the shape of each particle is irregular. The polymer obtained from polymerizing an alpha olef in in the presence of such a catalyst is a fine powder of low bulk density and shows a wide particle size distribution. The catalyst activity furthermore cannot be said to be sufficiently high. It is an object of the invention to provide a catalyst component which exhibits a higher activity and higher stereo reguIarity, and can produce a polyolefin powder, especially polypropylene, having a high bulk density. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a catalyst component for polymerization of alpha olefins which is formed by bringing a magnesium containing solid obtained by co grinding a a magnesium halide, b and aromatic carboxylic acid ester and c an aromatic carboxylic acid, aromatic carboxylic acid halide or aromatic carboxylic anhydride into contact with a titanium compound. The invention also provides a catalyst composed of the above catalyst component and an organic aluminum compound, and a method for polymerizing alpha olefins which is characterized by homopolymerizing an alpha olefin or copolymerizing it with ethylene or other alpha olefin in the presence of such a catalyst. Although the reason why a polymer having an improved bulk density is obtained when using the present catalyst component is not completely understood, this unexpected effect is exhibited by the combination ofComponents b and c . It may be postualted that the combination ofComponents b and c results in a material or a reaction mechanism with the characteristics of a binder, so that at the time of contact ofComponents a , b and c as well as at the time of subsequent contact thereof with a titanium compound, the fine particles of the supported catalyst are tightly attsched together. As the magnesium halide, there may be mentioned magnesium di halides, i.e. magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide and magnesium iodide, among which magnesium chloride is particularly preferred. For the convenience of use, these magnesium halides are advantageously employed as a powder having in general an average particle diameter of 1 50 F although that of a greater particle diameter can also be employed Further, these magnesium halides are preferably those which contain substantially no water of crystallization, i.e. the so called anhy drides. Therefore, where a commercially available product is to be used, it is desirable to treat the magnesium halide by heating at 200 6000C in 0 the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen or at 00 400 C under re duced pressure. Included among suitable aromatic carboxylic acid esters are aromatic monocarboxylic acid esters having no substituents on the aromatic ing and aromatic monocarboxylic acid esters having one or more substituents on the aromatic ring. Specific examples of the aromatic monocarboxylic acid esters having no substituent on the aromatic ring include benzoic acid alkyl esters such as methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, n propyl benzoate, isopropyl benzoate, n butyl benzoate, isobutyl benzoate, tert butyl benzoate, namyl benzoate, isoamyl benzoate, n hexyl benzoate, n octyl benzoate and 2 ethyl hexyl benzoate benzoic acid cycloalkyl esters such as cyclopentyl benzoate and cyclohexyl benzoate, benzoic acid aryl esters such as phenyl benzoate, 4 tolyl benzoate and benzyl benzoate. Examples of aromatic monocarboxylic acid esters having a substituent or substituents on the aromatic ring are hydroxybenzoic acid esters in which the subsitiuent is a hydroxyl group, alkoxybenzoic acid esters in which the substituent is an alkoxy group and alkylbenzoid acid esters in which the substituent is an alkyl group.

Among the above described aromatic carboxylic acid esters, preferred are methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, methyl p hydroxybenzoate, ethyl p hydroxybenzoate, methyl anisate, ethyl anisate, methyl p touylate and ethyl p toluylate.

Among these aromatic carboxylic acid halides, the acid chlorides are preferred, benzoyl chloride being particularly preferred. As illustrative examples of the aromatic carboxylic anhydride, there may be mentioned benzoic anhydride, p toluic anhydride, p ethylbenzoic anhydride and anisic anhydride. Among those benzoic anhydride is preferred. The magnesium containing solid may be obtained by co grinding a a magnesium halide, b an aromatic carboxylic acid ester and c an aromatic carboxylic acid, an aromatic carboxylic acid halide or an aromatic carboxylic anhydride. In addition to the manner of using the above three components simultaneously, the co grinding can also be effected by cogrinding two of the three first and then adding the remaining compound and co grinding. The means for co grinding may be a grinding machine conventionally employed for obtaining a pulverized product, for example, a rotary ball mill, a vibration ball mill or an impact ball mill. The co grinding operation is desirably performed in vacuum or in an atmosphere of an inert gas and in the substantial absence of moisture and oxygen. The conditions for co grinding are not limited, but in general, the co grinding temperature is 0 200 C and the co grinding time is, depending on the kind of the grinding machine, 0.5 100 hours. The co grinding treatment may also be effected in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane1 heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene or xylene.

Among those, tetravalent titanium halides such as titanium tetrachloride, trichloroethoxytitanium, dichlorodibutoxytitanium and dichlorodiphenoxytitanium are preferred and titanium tetrachloride is particularly preferred. While the contact of the magnesium containing solid and the titanium compound may be effected in any manner, for example, by such means as mixing and stirring both components or by a mechanical grinding means utilizing a rotary ball mill, it is particularly desirable to add the titanium compound to the magnesium containing solid and stir to contact them at a contacting temperature in the range of from OOC to the boiling point of the titanium compound 136.4 C for titanium tetrachloride and a contacting time or 0.5 20 hours. In addition, the contact may be conducted in the presence of an inert solvent, such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride or 1,2 dichloroethane. The amount of the magnesium containing solid to be used relative to the titanium compound or a micture of the titanium compound and the inert solvent is suitably from 30 to 300 g l.

The catalyst component of this invention is combined with an organic aluminum compound to obtain a catalyst for homopolymerizing an alphaolefin or copolymerizing an alpha olefin with ethylene or other alpha olefin. The organic aluminum compound compound to be combined with the catalyst component in polymerizing an alpha olefin is represented by the general formula A1X, wherein R represents an alkyl group or an aryl group, X represents a halogen atom, an alkoxy group or a hydrogen atom and n is any number in the range of 1 n 3.

Among those trialkylaluminums, trethylaluminum and triisobutylaluminum are particularly preferred. In addition, these trialkylaluminums may be used in combination with other organic aluminum compounds, for example, industrially easily available diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, diethylaluminum ethoxide, diethylaluminum hydride, or a mixture or complex compound thereof. Further, the organic aluminum compounds are desirably used in combination with an electron donating compound, although they can be used alone. As the electron donating compound, there may be mentioned carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid esters, alcohols, ethers, ketones, amines, amides, nitriles, aldehydes, alcoholates, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony compounds in which each such element is attached directly or via carbon or oxygen to the organic group,phosphamides, thioethers, thioesters and carbonic acid esters, among which the carboxylic acid esters are preferably employed.

The amount of the organic aluminum compound to be used relative to the catalyst component of this invention is generally from 1 to 2000 moles per gram atom of titanium in said catalyst component, and from 20 to about 500 moles is particularly preferred. Further, the mixing ratio of the organic aluminum compound and the electron donating compound is chosen in such range that the organic aluminum compound calculated as aluminum is present in an amount of from 0.1 to 40 gram atoms, preferably from 1 to 25 gram atoms, per mole of the electron donating compound. The thus obtained catalyst composed of the catalyst component and the organo aluminum compound and the electron donating compound exhibits excellent performance as a catalyst for homopolymerization of alphaolefins having 3 6 carbon atoms, for example, propylene, butene 1, 4methylpentene 1 and hexene 1 and random and block copolymerizations of the above mentioned alpha olefins with one another and or with ethylene.
