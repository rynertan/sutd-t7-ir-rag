# CONSTRUCTION OF MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
This invention provides novel strains of microorganisms e.g., Pseudomonas putida Biotype A which are capable of converting toluene to muconic acid quantitatively by the ortho Î² ketoadipate pathway. Muconate lactonising enzyme is not induced in the microorganism, thereby permitting the muconic acid to be produced and accumulated in a quantity greater than one gram of muconic acid per litre of growth medium.
