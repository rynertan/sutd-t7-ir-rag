# A method for the selective removal of ferric ions from an aqueous solution, selective metal chelating resins for use therein, and a method for their preparation.

## Abstract
Ferric ions are selectively removed from aqueous solu tions by contacting the solution with a metal chelating resin consisting of the acid quaternized form of a cross linked polymer produced by the condensation of a phenolic com ponent comprising one or more phenols, formaldehyde, and a diamino component comprising one or more di secondary amino compounds under neutral conditions. The resin is prepared by treating the cross linked polymer with an aque ous solution of a strong mineral acid.
