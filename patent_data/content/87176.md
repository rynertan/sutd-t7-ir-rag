# Method for the preparation of a planographic printing plate.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of a planographic printing plate wherein a sheet material, which comprises an outer hydrophilic colloid layer on the surface of which is concen trated a silver image formed by the silver complex diffusion transfer process on NiS or mixed crystal NiS.Ag₂S develop ment nuclei in which the molar ratio of NiS to Ag₂S is not smaller than 1 1, is treated with a liquid hydrophobizing the silver image for planographic printing, the said liquid containing in dissolved state a heterocyclic compound corresponding to one of the following tautomeric structures A and B or C and D
