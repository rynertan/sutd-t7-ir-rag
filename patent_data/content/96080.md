## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of drying and shaping a clothing mainly formed of vegetable fiber or blended with vegetable fiber and synthetic fiber such as, for example, an outing shirt, a white garment and coat and so forth and a body shaped bag used therefor. Heretofore, a clothing of vegetable fiber is dried and finished by adhering fabric size of wet state to the clothing and drying the clothing with an iron or an iron pressing machine, thereby drying and solidifying the size by means of the heat and pressure of the iron pressing machine. In this case, wet size together with the heat and pressure are required under the conditions. On the other hand, a clothing mainly formed of animal fiber or blended with animal fiber and synthetic fiber is shaped and finished by a steam iron, a steam pressing machine, a body shaped steam and hot air finishing machine, a steam cabinet, and a steam tunnel, etc. In this case, the steam and small tension are required under the conditions. When the steam is sprayed to the animal fiber clothing, since the animal fiber has plasticity with the steam, and the clothing is immediately dried so as not to remain the moisture in the animal fiber, the predetermined shape can be maintained in the clothing. In case of the animal fiber clothing, no size is necessary. A body shaped steam and hot air finishing machine used for shaping and finishing an animal fiber clothing, e.g., an upper garment of a sack suit, an overcoat, etc. serves to dry and shape the clothing ordinarily by wearing the clothing to be finished on a body shaped bag formed of grey of heat resistant, stem resistant and air permeable synthetic fiber, retaining the front of the clothing, then feeding steam into the bag to give sufficient wet heat to the clothing, stopping the steam, thereafter blowing hot air of low temperature 50 to 700 C to expand the body shaped bag, and exhausting the remaining steam from the bag. It is indispensable to sufficiently eject the steam to finish the animal fiber clothing. If the air flow and pressure are excessibely more than required, the animal fiber will expand, and the flow rate and pressure of the hot air may be in the degree as necessary as the formation of the clothing to be pressed, and the hot air temperature may be preferably lower than 1000 C. Because the animal fiber might be damaged at the temperature higher than 1000 C. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a method of drying and shaping a clothing formed mainly of vegetable fiber or blended with vegetable fiber and synthetic fiber, which can finish the clothing beautifully by the steps of blowing hot air of strong pressure and high heat into a body shaped bag to expand the entire bag and to impart tension to the clothing and drying and shaping the clothing with hot air slightly ejected through the texture of the grey of hard permeability forming the bag and the surface heat of the bag. Another object of the present invention is to provide a body shaped bag for performing the method, which bag can prevent the discharge of large quantity of hot air externally from the interior of the bag with the grey formed in hard air permeability, thereby obtaining necessary tension at the bag, maintaining the surface heat required and eliminating the decrese in the working efficiency due to the discharge of the hot air. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a body shaped bag which can dry and shape the superposed portions in double or more laminates of the clothing, e.g., pockets, shoulder portions, etc. similarly to the other portions of the clothing in the same period of time. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The specific nature of the invention, as well as other objects, uses and advantages thereof, will clearly appear from the description and from the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of the finishing machine mounted with a body shaped bag used for the method of drying and finishing a clothing according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is a front view of the body shaped bag constructed according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The method of drying and finishing a clothing mainly formed of vegetable fiber or blended with vegetable fiber and synthetic fiber, and a body shaped bag used therefor of the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, and the finishing machine necessary to shape and finish the clothing of the present invention will be first schematically described. A finishing machine has a post 11 stood on the upper sufface of a base 10, a neck fixture 12 provided on the top of the post 11, an iron or heater 13 for introducing steam from the neck fixture 12 to the vertical hem of a shirt front, a post 14 stood at the front, and a vertical hem pressing unit 16 provided via a linkage 15 from the post 14. A hot air generator is internally mounted in the base 10. When the hot air generator is operated, the hot air of predetermined quantity is blown from below into the body shaped bag 21. The bodyshaped bag 21 used in this invention is mounted on the finishing machine to cover the post 11 and the heater 13 as shown in Fig. 1. A Sirrocco fan for blowing hot air used for the finishing machine has strong power of the blower used for finishing the animal fiber clothing. That is, the fan used for the animal fiber clothing finishing machine has ordinarily 200liy 3 and less than 20 m3 min. of air flow rate of static pressure O mm112O , but the fan used for the finishing machine of the present invention has 400 to 750W and 30 to 40 m31min. of air flow rate of static pressure 0 mmH20 or higher. In the execution of the present invention, the doby shaped bag which has high heat resistance and strength, is sealed at the neck portion, arm portions and waist portion and is formed at the grey of hard air permeability, is mounted on the finishing machine, the vegetable fiber clothing to be dried and shaped is mounted on the outer periphery of the body shaped bag, both vertical hems of the clothing are fastened under strong pressure between the vertical hem pressing unit with heat resistence sponge for pressing the vertical hem from the exterior of the clothing and the upper and lower heaters of slender shape provided in the bag, and then high pressure and high temperature hot air sufficient to expand the clothing is blown from the hot air blowing unit at 100 to 2000C of the surface temperature of the bag. The vegetable fiber has much stronger wet strength than the animal fiber but has much less wet elongation and less elongation at the wet heating time as well as much higher heat resistant temperature than the animal fiber. Therefore, the vegetable fiber clothing can be efficiently dried, shaped and finished due to the properties of the vegetable fiber described above according to the method of the present invention.Under this conditions, it is necessary that the grey of the bodyshaped bag is formed in hard air permeability according to the method of the present invention. The concrete embodiment of the method of drying and shaping a clothing according to the present invention will now be described in more detail. The vegetable fiber clothing is washed, is then sized, is then finished at the neck and arm holes by a neck cuffs pressing machine, is further lightly pressed at the tack portion of the arms, and is mounted on the body shaped bag in the state that the vertical hem of the front of the clothing, the back and both arms are moistened. The neck portion is fastened by the neck fixture, and the arms of the body shaped bag are inserted into the arms of the clothing. Further, both lower ends of the vertical hem of the clothing are pulled downwardly to elongate the wrinkles, and the surface of the clothing is pressure at the hem by the pressing unit.The body shaped bag is, of cource, mounted on the finishing machine so that the neck and the waist of the clothing are sealed. The ends of the arms of the body shaped bag are sealed by means, e.g., sewing or the like. Thereafter, the hot air 3 is fed at the flow rate of 25 to 35 m min. in case of static pressure O into the body shaped bag to expand the bag and the air pressure in the bag is maintained at 15 to 25 mmH O, and the surface temperature of the bag is maintained at 100 to 2000 C. Further, the heat is applied for 20 to 40 sec. to the body shaped bag, thereby drying and shaping to finish the clothing. As described above, the closing sized and moistened is expanded by the body shaped bag by means of the hot air of high pressure, and is thus extended and shaped, and is further dried and solidified at the size by the slight hot air ejected through the texture of the grey of the hard air permeability and by the surface heat of the bag. In this manner, the clothing can be dried, shaped and finished. Since the pressure is internally applied to the clothing according to the method of the present invention, the surface of the clothing thus finished has beautiful appearance peculier for the fiber, and the back surface of the clothing has advantageously relatively smooth state to be readily worn on the human being. The embodiment of the body shaped bag used for the method of drying and shaping the clothing of the present invention will now be described in more detail. The body shaped bag of the present invention has not only the high heat resistance but also hard air permeability as the most advantageous feature, which can provide necessary tention and can maintain the permeability for retaining the necessary temperature on the surface. The body shaped bag of the present invention has, as shown in Fig. 2, a bag body 21 formed of body, brest, shoulders and neck, right and left arms 22 formed integrally.The ends of the arms 22 are sealed by sewing or the like.The arms 22 are formed in half sleeve length as shown to finish I clothings to be readily mounted with the closing.The body shaped bag also has a neck portion 25 and a waist portion 26 opened at the upper and lower parts. Strings 27 are inserted into the lower portions of the bag body 21 to seqeeze the waist portion when the closing is mounted on the finishing machine. It is noted that when the bag 21 is mounted on the finishing machine, the neck portion 25 and the waist portion 26 are sealed. Further, a plurality of pockets 28 are aligned at the insides of both sides of the bag 21 and elastic slender rectangular thin plates 29 are respectively inserted into the pockets 28, and are made of steel plates, heat resistant plastic plates, etc. The plates 29 prevents the wrinkles and slacks of the waist of the clothing by natural expansion when the hot air is blown into the interior of the bag to expand the bag 21. The grey of the body shaped bag is formed by twill weaving raw polyester yarns of 100 denier for warps and 100 denier for wefts in the density of 214.96 pieces inch, and has 0.22 mm thick, 28 of longitudinal elongation, 27 of lateral elongation, 3.7kg of longitudinal tearing strength, 1.7kg of lateral tearing strength, 187kg 5cm of longitudinal tensile strength, 100kg 5cm of lateral tensile strength, and 2 is rolled by calender rolls to the degree of 2.Scc cm sec. of air permeability. The superposed portions, double or more laminates of the pockets, shoulders or the like of the clothing 2 use polyester grey of 5cc cm2 sec. of air permeability. Since the melting point of the polyester grey is 240 to 2500 C, the body shaped bag can endure against 2000C sufficiently.The hem of the body shaped bag, i.e., the portion to be interposed between the internal iron and the pressing plate may be preferably formed of further high heat resistant grey. Silicone resin may be coated on the texture of the body shaped bag. Since the body shaped bag of the present invention is formed particularly of the grey of the composition described above and the air permeability of the grey is formed to approx. 2 2.5cc cm2 sec. as described above, and to approx. Scc cm2 sec. at the superposed portions, e.g., pockets, shoulders, etc. to be hard air permeable, the bag can be provided with necessary tent ion and can maintain the necessary temperature to dry the clothing.
