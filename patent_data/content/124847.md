# A FLEXIBLE BASE PLATE FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD AND A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for the preparation of a flexible base for printed circuit board of the type formed of lamination of a flexible sheet like polymeric base and a metal, e.g. copper, foil adhesively bonded to the surface thereof by use of an adhesive, in which the surface of the polymeric base prior to bonding of the metal foil is subjected to exposure to low temperature plasma so that the adhesive bonding strength between the polymeric base and the metal foil can be greatly improved.
