# Process for the high velocity dip coating of filament like materials in a molten metal bath.

## Abstract
In a case where filament like articles e.g. wires are dip coated by upwardly passing the article into a bath of molten metal through the bottom and top vertical openings of the spout containing the molten metal, the article to be coated is wrapped, before it enters the bottom inlet opening in the spout, with a blanket of protective gas at a pressure sufficient to cause the gas to penetrate into the spout simultaneously with the article, to progressively and regular ly circulate around the molten metal and to steadily emerge from the upper opening of the spout still effectively shielding the freshly coated article.
