# Charge sensor.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a charge detector, more particularly for reading binary information in a CTD. The detector in principle consists of a flipflop having two cross coupled MOS transistors and two MOS transistors acting as loads. The signal to be read and the reference signal are supplied to the gates of the loads. The junctions between the driver transistors and the loads are connected to reset transistors. The drains of the loads are applied to a fixed supply voltage and the sources of the driver transistors are applied via a switching transistor to the other supply voltage. The circuit arrangement is operated so that before the activation of the flipflop the said junctions are set to a signal dependent preadjustment. When the switching transistor is then energized, the flipflop will occupy the correct stage with a higher degree of reliability and without being influenced by clock cross talk.
