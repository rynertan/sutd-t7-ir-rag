# Emulsions of perfluorocarbons in aqueous media.

## Abstract
Increased stability is conferred on oil in water emulsions of perfluorocarbons by addition of a minor 0.1 5 w v amount of a fluorinated compound of higher boiling point than the perfluorocarbon being emulsified. The added fluorinated compound is preferably a perfluorinated satu rated polycyclic hydrocarbon. The most preferred additive is perfluoroperhydrofluoranthene.
