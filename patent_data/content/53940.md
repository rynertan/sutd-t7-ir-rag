# Poly ester amide capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase derived from 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, dicarboxylic acid and aromatic monomer capable of forming an amide linkage.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essential ly of the recurring units a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety, b aryl dicarboxyl moiety or trans 1,4 dicarboxycyclohexane moie ty, c an aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer and d optionally, dioxyaryl moiety in the proportions indicated. Preferably, the aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is p aminophenol or p phenylene diamine. The resulting poly ester amide ex hibits a melting temperature below 400 C., preferably below 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present invention is preferably formed by a melt polymerisation technique.
