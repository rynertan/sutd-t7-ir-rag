# Thermoelectric generator device and method of forming same.

## Abstract
The invention deals with a thermoelectric generator device and a method of forming same. The thermoelectric device comprises a multiplicity of thermocouples 20, 22 on a substrate 14 in a narrow strip form, the thermocouples being formed by printing with first and second inks formed of suitable different powdered metals with a proper binder or flux. The thermocouples are formed in series and the opposed couples areas are melted to form an intermingling of the two metals 16, 18 and the strips 10 may be formed in substantial lengths and rolled onto a reel, or in relatively short strip form and disposed in a side by side abutting relationship in substantial numbers to define a generally rectangular panel form with opposed ends in electrical connection. The method of forming the panels includes the steps of feeding a suitable substrate, either in a continuous roll or sheet form, through first and second printers to form the series connected multiplicity of thermocouples thereon. From the printers the sheet or strip passes through a melter such as an induction furnace and from the furnace it passes through a sheeter, if the strip is in roll form. The sheets are then slit into narrow strips relative to the thermocouples, printed thereon and the strips are then formed into a bundle. A predetermined number of bundles are assembled into a panel form.
