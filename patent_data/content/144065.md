# Laminated safety glass.

## Abstract
Transparent or translucent laminated safety glass hav ing an at least two layered structure, in which one outer layer is a relatively soft synthetic resin layer and the other outer layer is a hard substrate layer, characterized in that said relatively soft synthetic resin layer comprises a surface layer of a reformed polyurethane type thermoplastic resin obtained by impregnating a polymerizable compound con taining a polymerizable unsaturated group into a polyurethane type thermoplastic resin and polymerizing the compound and an inner layer of a polyurethane type thermoplastic resin which is continuous or non continuous with said surface layer.
