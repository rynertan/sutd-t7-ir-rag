## Description
HIGHLY WEATHERABLE COATINCS any coatings are used on surfaces which are employed in an outdoor environmeDt. Such coatings are exposed to sunlight, moisture and the like under a variety of temperarure conditions and must therefore be able to withstand such changes in climate. Among the preferred veatherable coatings are those based on acrylic polymers. However, after long exposures of time even these coatings will suffer deterioration at a pace which is dependent upon the geographical area involved. As a result, several additives have been incorporated into coating formulations to slov down the degradative process Among the more commonly employed additives are those which protect against ultraviolet radiation and hydrolytic attack.Hovever, incorporation of such additives increases the cost of producing weatherable coatings. Thus it would be desirable to produce a highly veatherable coating which did not require the presence of such, expensive additives. In addition, many of the weatherable coatings heretofore employed utilize relatively large amounts of volatile organic solvents. With the rising price of energy, as vell as the increased appreciation of the deleterious effects of organic solvents on the environment, it would be desirable to produce a weatherable coating which employed only s minimal amount of volatile organic solvent. Among the compositions which have been developed in response to such need for highly weatberable coatings are those disclosed in BritishPatents No. 1,556,436, and 1,536,464 which contain copolymer consisting of 50 75 weight percent t butyl acrylate 5 30 weight percent styrenes vinyltoluene or methyl methacrylate and 4 20 weight percent of acrylonitrile.However, these copolymers, which are cured by crosslinking with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, possess high glass transition temperatures as they have a Durran softening point of 9Q 120gC. Thus, as is apparent to one skilled in the art, these coatings must be applied as either 1 powders or 2 low solids solutions, since high solids coatings containing such polymers vould te too highly viscous to be utile.Therefore coatings employing these polymers are compsratively uneconomical as the use of povders would necessitate the formation of relatively thick 38 urn coatings of at least about 1.5 mil vhereas a lov solids solution would require the use of relatively large amounts of solvent. Thus, it was completely upexpected that polymers of t butyl acrylate could be produced which had comparatively lov glass transition temperatures i.e. of less than about 50 C and which when formulated into coating compositions vould possess desirable veatherable properties Moreover, because of such low glass transition temperatures, coatings employing these novel polymers may be employed in a high solids solution form thus permitting economical use of both the polymers and organic solvent. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to polymers vhich, vhen formulated into coating compositions, demonstrate a high degree of outdoor veatherability. These polymers are lov molecular weight copolymers having a glass transition temperature of less than about 50 C which are comprised of a from 10 to 90 weight percent, preferably of from 20 veight percent or units derived thereof to 70 weight percent, t butyl acrylate b from 1 to 30 weight percent, preferably of from 5 to about 20 weight percent, of a functional comonomer containing or units derived thereof at least one active crosslinking sit and c from 0 to 85 weight percent, preferably of from 5 to 60 weight percent of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers which are capable of polymerizing with t butyl acrylate or units derived thereof. The term active crosslinking site refers to a location on the comonomer which is capable of reacting with the crosslinker employed such that a crosslinkage is produced. Among the preferred functional comonomers which may be employed are those vhich, when reacted with t butyl acrylate will produce a copolymer possessing an active carboxyl group, hydroxyl group, and or amide group. If desired, mixtures of active carboxyl group producing monomers, active hydroxyl group producing monomers and or active amide producing group monomers may be employed. Illustrative of such carboxyl group producing monomers are alpha unsaturated carboxylic acids such as, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, a ch lo roa cry 1 ic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, aconitic acid, maleic acid, fumeric acid and the like. Half acid esters of the dicarboxylic acids can also be used, such as methylhydrogen itaconate, butyl hydrogen itaconate, ethyl hydrogen maleate, and the like. Mixtures of these acids can also be used. The preferred active carboxyl group producing monomers are acrylic acid and methyacrylic acid. Illustrative of active hydroxyl group producing monomers are monohydroxy and polyhydroxy asters of acrylic acid and methyacrylic acid, such as, for example, 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2 hydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate, 3 hydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate, 5 hydroxyamyl acrylate and methacrylate, 6 hydroxyhexyl acrylate, and methacrylate, 8 hydroxyoctyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2,3 dihydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate 2,3 dihydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate, and the like. Hixtures of these hydroxyalkyl esters can also be used. The preferred hydroxyalkyl esters are hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. Illustrative of active amide group producing monomers are monomers such as acrylamide, methacrylamide and the like. In addition to the t butyl acrylate and functional comonomer components, the copolymer may additionally contain other ethylenically unsaturated monomers which are capable of copolymerization vith t butyl acrylate. These comonomers may be added to the polymerization mixture to achieve desired effects well knovn to one skilled in the art However, it is desirable that the incorporation of these monomers not raise the glass transition temperature of the resultant copolymer above about 509C so that such copolymers produced may be employed in high solids coating compositions.Exemplary of such ethylenically unsaturated monomers are acrylic esters and methacrylic esters such as for example methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, sec butyl acrylate, n amyl acrylate, isoamyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, 3,5,5 trimethyihexyl acrylate, decyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, hexadecyl acrylate octadecyl acrylate, octadecenyl acrylate, n amyl methacrylate, sec amyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, 2 ethylbutyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, 3,5,5 trimethylhexyl methacrylate, decyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, hexadecyl methacrylate, octadecyl methacrylate, butoxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate or other alkoxyethyl acrylate or methacrylatec, methylmethacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, sec butyl methacrylate, t butyl methacrylate, t amyl methacrylate, t amyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate or methacrylate, and the like as well as other q , B ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, ethylene, butadiene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and the like.

Typically, the copolymers of the instant invention are prepared by reacting monomer feed mix containing t butyl acrylate, a functional comonomer having at least one active crosslinking site, and optionally other reactive monomers with a catalyst feed mixture pt an elevated temperature in the presence of an organic solvent. The catalyst employed is typically a free radical initiator or a redox catalyst.

The catalysts are employed in the usual catalytically effectiçe concentrations which are known to those skilled in the art of polymerization. Typically, the polymerization process vill require the use of a solvent. The solvents which may be employed are thost organic solvents which vill not interfere vith the polymerization reaction. These solvents are vell known to one skilled in the art. Illustrative of such solvents are ethoxyethy acetate, methylene chloride, ethanol, iso propanol, n propanol, n butanol, iso butanol, tert butanol the methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl esters of acetic acid acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, benzene, toluene and the like. In general, the polymerization reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 50 C to about 1600C, vith a preferred temperature of from about 900C to about 1300C. However, this range will vary depending upon the particular catalyst or catalyst system selected. Reaction pressure may vary from subatmospheric to superatmospheric with atmospheric pressure being preferred. Reaction time is not critical and may vary from hours to days depending upon the reaction batch size, pressure, temperature,. etc. selected. The coating compositions of this invention comprise mixtures of 1 the novel t butyl acryla te functional monomer optionally other ethylenically unsaturated monomer copolymer of the instant invention, 2 a suitable crosslinker and 3 suitable additives that are known to one skilled n the art of coating formulations.

The novel compositions of this invention may be formulated into high solids coatings, i.e., as much as 75 weight percent or higher, although this figure may vary in accordance with the solvent selected, the viscosity desired, the application temperature selected, etc. The crosslinkers which may be employed will vary with the type of functional crosslinking sites which are present on the copolymer selected. Thus, for copolymers containing active hydroxyl groups crosslinkers including polyepoxides such as cycloaliphatic epoxides snd diglycidyl epoxides , polyfunctional isocyanates, etherated amino formaldehyde resins, etc. and mixtures thereof may be employed. For copolymers containing active carboxyl groups crosslinkers including polyepoxides such as cycloaliphatic epoxides and diglycidyl epoxides , aziridines, carbodiimides, etherated amino formaldehyde resins, etc. and mixtures thereof may be employed. For copolymers containing active amide groups, crosslinkers including polyfunctional isocyanates, polyepoxides such as cycloaliphatic epoxides and diglycidyl epoxides , etherated amino formaldehyde resins, etc. and mixtures thereof may be employed. For copolymers which contain mixtures of active hydroxyl, carboxyl and or amide groups, mixtures of suitable crosslinkers may be utilized. Preferred crosslinkers include polyepoxides and etherated amino formaldehyde resins1 as these crosslinkers are reactive with active hydroxyl, carboxyl and amide groups. Illustrative of the polyfunctional isocyanates which may be employed for copolymers containing active hydroxyl and or amide sites are 3,5,5 trimethyl 1 isocyanato 3 isocyanatomethyl cyclohexane, di 2 isocyanatoethyl bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylate, 2,4 tÏlylene diisocyanate, 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, the m and p xylylene diisocyanates, te tramethylene diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl4,4 methane diisocyanate, cyclohexane1,4 diisocyanate, l,5 naphthylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanate diphenyl ether, 2,4,6 tri isocyanste toluene, 4,4µ,4 triisocyanate triphenyl methane, diphenylene 4,4 diisocyanate, the polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates and the like. Typical representatives of the polyepoxide crosslinkers which may be employed are the cycloaliphatic epoxides described in U.S. PatentsNo. 3,027,357, No.. 2,890,194 and No. 2,890,197 especially column 7, line 11 to column 7s line 38 of No. 3,027,357 , including 3.4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl 314 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl adipate, bis 2,3 epoxy cyclopentyl ether, vinyl cyclohexene dioxide, 2 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl 5,5 spiro 2,3 epoxycyclohexane m dioxane, bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethylzadipate, endo and exo dicyclopentadiene diepoxide, limonene diepoxide, and the like.

These amounts will vary vith the particular functional monomer and crosslinker combination selected, and will be known to one skilled in the art. Frequently, the crosslinking reaction will require the use of a catalyst. The amounts and types of catalyst needed, if any, are dependent upon the particular active site crosslinker combination selected and vill be vell known to one skilled in the art. Thus, for example, when aminoformaldehyde resins are employed as crosslinkers, catalysts such as p toluene sulfonic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, dinonyl naphthalene disulfonic acid, or the stannous salt of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid can be used. With cycloaliphatic epoxides catalysts such as stannous octanoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, triflic acid, the reaction product of triflic acid and stannous oxide, diethyl ammonium triflate, etc. can be used. This crosslinking reaction may be performed at reaction conditions well known to one skilled in the art. Typically, temperatures of from 1100C to 2000C are employed. Crosslinking reaction time is not critical and vill vary in accordance with the conditions, reactants, etc.selected.

The above results indicate that the coatings of this invention possess unexpectedly superior weatherable properties relative to commercial acrylic based coatings which do not contain t butyl acrylate. This is shown most clearly by cxamination of Tables III and IV wherein the coatings of this invention displayed enhanced detergent and ultrs violet light resistance. Example 7 A one package, high solids coating of the cotelomer prepared and described in Example 3 was prepared in the folloving manner. A pigment grind was prepared by adding the folloving list of ingredients to a ball mill and grinding to a fineness of grind of 7 on a Hegman scale.

TNTo this grind was added 14.6 g. of Cymel 325 , a commercially available melamine formaldehyde resin,American Cyanamid, and the mill was rolled for one more hour. The coating vas reduced with 27g. of propoxy propanol to give a 57.6X weight solids system with a 2 Zahn Cup viscosity of 24 second.This coating was spray applied as described inExample 5. Examples B and 8 A and Comparative Experiments E, F, F A and G Using a pigment grind similar to that employed in Example 5, high solids coatings were prepared utilizing the cotelomern produced inExample 4 Examples 8 and 8 A and in ComparativeExperiments A Comparative Experiment E , B Comparative Experiments F and F A and C Comparative Experiment G respectively. These cotelomers were crosslinked utilizing the crosslinkers shown in Table V, belov. These coatings were the spray applied to panels as described in Example 5. In order to test the effects of long term outdoor exposure on these coatings, as vell as those produced in Examples 5, 6 and 7, panels were sent toMiami, Florida. Here the panels were placed outdoors facing south, while tilted at a 450 angle. The panels were le ft in this position and exposed to the elements for the periods indicated inTable V, below. The panels vere examined for their 60 gloss, color and chalk. Chalk ratings are based upon photographs appearing in Exposure StandardsManual, Federation of Societies for PaintTechnology. Color is rated on a 10 0 scale by visual observation, employing the folloving scale 10 No change 9 Very slight 8 Slight 6 Definite 4 Mediuim 2 Bad 0 Very bad The results of such testing are shown inTable V below TABLE V 45 SOUTH, FLORIDA OUTDOOR EXPOSURE DATA After 12 Mo.
