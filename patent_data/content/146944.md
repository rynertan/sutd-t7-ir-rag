## Description
Interferons referred to as IFN hereinafter so far known can be classified into three large groups, i.e. IFN α, IFN β and IFN γ. IFN α is mainly produced from leukocytes, IFN β from fibroblasts and IFN γ from T lymphocytes. These IFNs have been noted as biologically active substances having anti virus activity, activating activities upon natural killer cells and macrophages, anti tumor activity, and the like. However, the conventional methods for obtaining IFNs by isolation from leukocytes and cultured cells cannot provide them sufficiently. Recombinant DNA technology has now been developed to the extent that the mass production of substances which are secreted only in a small amount in cells of higher animals and which are hard to isolate, i.e. substances such as IFN has become possible by using microorganisms. For example, mRNAs of IFN β and IFN α were respectively isolated from cells and DNA complementary to the mRNA cDNA was synthesized enzymatically and cloned in As for IFN γ, there has been a report that it has a stronger cell inhibiting activity than other IFNs based on the experiment using animal cells B.Y.

USA The present inventors have independently cloned a DNA coding for IFN γ to obtain a clone coding for a novel IFN γ wherein, as apparent from the base sequence illustrated in Table 1, the ninth amino acid of the mature IFN γ reported by Devos, Thereafter, the present inventors have studied the production of derivatives of the IFN γ polypeptide using the IFN γ gene illustrated in Table 1 as a starting material.
