# Method of manufacturing structural members of epoxy resin.

## Abstract
A method of producing laminated structural members, such as sheets or elongated profile elements, of fabric rein forced epoxi plastic. A reinforcement fabric is soaked with epoxi resin and a hardener. Upon hardening, a much thicker layer of epoxi resin, a hardener and a thickening agent is applied so as to form an intermediate layer. Onto the latter, a reinforcement fabric and possibly another thick inter mediate layer and a thin fabric reinforced layer is applied. Finally, the resulting laminate product is permitted to harden on a support or a mould bed so as to form a rather a rigid structural member.

## Description
Method to manufacture structural members of epoxi plastic The invention relates to a method to manufacture sheet.or elongated members, especially profile members, of fabric reinforced epoxi plastic. Epoxi plastics are used to an increasing extent in building industry, e.g. as a coating on concrete floors, as an adhesive and as an injection or repair material in concrete structures. Epoxi plastics have a number of good qualities which are of considerable value in this connection, namely among others a strong adhesion to most materials, dimensional stability after hardening, low shrinkage, chemical resistance and electric insulating capacity. However, seen from an industrial hygienic point of view as well as a practical one, epoxi plastics are difficult to handle, especially because of their extreme adhesiveness. Therefore, epoxi plastics have not been used so far as an independent construction material. The main object of the invention is to achieve a practically suitable and, from an industrial hygienic point of view, relatively harmless method to manufacture sheet or profile members of fabric reinforced epoxi plastic. This is accomplished by the inventive method, the basic features of which are stated in theappendedclaim 1. Suitable further features appear from the sub claims and the description below. Thus, in the method of manufacturing according to the invention, one start out with a rather thin fabric reinforced layer. It is possible to produce such a layer by spreading out a sheet of fabric, prefably a polyester material, on a support which is not adhesive relative to epoxi plastic.A suitable material for this purpose has turned out to be a thermoplastic foil, such as a polyethylene or aPVC foil, which is first laid out on a firm, preferably planar support, such as a table or the like. Then, the fabric is soaked with an epoxi resin and a haEdener, so that upon hardening a rather flexible fabric reinforced layer is obtained, which can easily be removed from the supporting foil. The basic feature of the invention is to let such a reinforced layer, possibly divided into plates or strips, form a support when applying a rather thick intermediate layer consisting of an epoxi resin, a rather slow hardener and a thickening agent, such as an epoxi filler. The intermediate layer is smoothed, and a fluent epoxi resin is spread on. Then a reinforced fabric, preferably likewise a polyester material, is applied while being thoroughly drenched, so that another fabric reinforced layer is formed.Hereby, a kind of sandwich laminate is obtained, and the rather thick intermediate layer can maintain a substantially uniform thickness during the hardening process, even if the hardening takes place on a support having non horizontal portions, e.g. ,for the manufacture of profile members. If so desired, in order to obtain a thicker and stronger laminate, it is possible to apply another thick intermediate layer epoxi resin, a hardener and a thickening agent on top of the reinforcement fabric, preferably before the first intermediate layer is hardened, as well as still another fabric reinforced layer, preferably of the same kind as the first rather thin fabric reinforced layer. This outer fabric reinforced layer can also be divided into plates, strips or the like. However, the intermediate layers and reinforcement fabrics should be continuous so as to secure high strength even of the joints between different segments or the like of the finished sheet or profile member. Upon application of all layers to be included in the laminated structural member, the laminate is permitted to finally harden on a support or a mould bed corresponding in shape to the desired final product, so that a rather rigid member will result. Of course, the hardened member can be further treated by grinding and or applying more epoxi plastic on certain portions, but normally such further treatment is not necessary. An essential advantage of the invention is that the member can be moved before the final hardening process and be easily handled when being laid onto the support or the like.This is made possible by the already hardened, outer fabric reinforced layer which is dry and dimensionally stable, though somewhat resilient. In case the outer fabric reinforced layer is divided into strips or plates, which are to be mutually folded before the member is finally hardened, a tape can preferably be applied over the joints to prevent the escape and adhesion of the intermediate layer. As to the handling of a member having two intermediate layers, it may be advantageous to apply eachintermediate layer on a separate supporting fabric reinforced layer and thereafter put both units together while laying a reinforced fabric between the two intermediate layers. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawing. Fig. 1 shows schematically in perspective view a fabric reinforced layer Fig. 2 shows in cross section and in a larger scale a laminate before being hardened and Fig. 3 shows in cross section the laminate laid on a support where it is permitted to harden. On a planar support a rather large and planar sheet Civing the dimensions 0,5 x 1000 x 4500 mm is produced.The sheet consists of a polyester fabric soaked with epoxi resin and a hardener so as to constitute, upon hardeningta thin and flexible sheet. Before applying the sheet, the support is provided with a polyethylene foil so as to permit easy removal of the sheet from the support and division of the sheet as desired, in this case into strips 2, indicated by dashed lines to the left in Fig. 1. The division can be effected by sawing, shearing oncutting he means of a suit able tool. For the manufacture of an elongated, angle profile member having mutually perpendicular and equally long legs, two strips 2a 0,5 x 40 x 4500 mm are first laid out, one adjacent to the other on a planar support. Thereafter, a first, rather thick appr. 2 mm intermediate layer 3a is applied. This layer, which consists of epoxi resin, a hardener and a thickening agent such as epoxi putty , is smoothed and soaked with a fluent epoxi resin, whereupon a reinforcement fabric 4 is applied and soaked into the thin epoxi resin.Thereafter, a corresponding sheet member with two strips 2b and a second thick, still not hardened intermediate layer 3b is laid on top of the reinforcement fabric 4, so as to form a symmetrical,still not hardened laminate unit 2a, 3a, 4, 3b, 2b. This laminate unit is laid on a support 5 having mutually perpendicular support surfaces as indicated in Fig. 3.Upon hardening, the desired L profile member of fabric reinforced epoxi plastic is obtained.
