The invention will become more apparent through the description of typical modes of practice of the invention which follows. BmNPV is one of the insect viruses belonging to the baculovirus group. It has high host specificity and infects the silkworm In selecting a DNA fragment containing a structural gene portion from among a number of DNA fragments produced from BmNPV DNA, Southern hybridization Mol. Coln., pp 382 389 using a probe prepared in a conventional manner is helpful among others. While the fragment to be selected must contain the structural gene portion, what is important is that the fragment also contains a fairly long DNA chain on the 5 side upstream side and, in some instances, such a DNA chain also on the 3 side downstream side . The length of each chain is of importance in connection with the efficiency of production of the desired useful substance. Although ease of handling is also a factor of significance, as will be mentioned hereinafter, whether a given chain length is adequate or not can be ascertained experimentally. The adequate chain length of DNA was determined as follows. With DNA fragments of different length, recombinant viruses containing gene for the production of a useful substance such as α IFN were constructed as described in Example 1. Then, cell cultures were infected with these recombinant viruses to compare the productivity of the useful substance. Efficient use can be made of various techniques in eliminating the structural gene portion from a fragment containing the structural gene for polyhedral protein with the preceding and succeeding DNA chains and removing for use a DNA chain having an appropriate length and containing the promoter region on the side upstream from the structural gene and, as the case may be, a DNA chain having an appropriate length and originally occurring downstream from the structural gene. Thus, fragments obtained by using various restriction enzymes are examined for their DNA sequences to thereby identify the structural gene portion so that the structural gene can be eliminated by digestion using exonuclease enzymes e.g., by digestion with The amino acid sequence of the polyhedral protein of BmNPV produced in the silkworm has been analyzed and reported to include 244 amino acids by S. B. Serebriani et al., The present inventors have ascertained that, to eliminate the polyhedrin gene and to utilize the upstream and downstream DNA fragments, a BmNPV DNA fragment about 10.6 kbp obtainable by In the description which follows, the case where the above mentioned suitable fragment will be used for the purposes of illustration where appropriate. The DNA sequences and so on will be indicated, unless otherwise specified, in a conventional manner. Thus, the 5 end is given on the left side and the 3 end on the right side, and a fragment resulting from restriction enzyme cleavage is indicated by a hyphen between the names of the restriction enzymes. In this case, too, the left and right have the same meanings as mentioned above. For example, the The gene portion coding for polyhedral protein can be detected by further cleavage of the above fragment into smaller fragments followed by screening thereof by Southern hybridization, for instance. Thus, in the above case, the presence of the structural gene in question could be confirmed in an The two fragments thus isolated are conveniently manipulated by inserting their fragments separately into plasmids containing artificial linkers. Commercially available plasmids pUC9 and pUC8 both from Pharmacia P L Biochemicals , for instance, are suited for that purpose. The After eliminating the polyhedrin gene in the above manner, a DNA fragment containing the virus derived promoter region upstream from the gene can be obtained. This fragment is useful in producing a vector plasmid by inserting this fragment, in combination with a DNA fragment downstream from the polyhedrin gene, which is also obtainable in the above polyhedrin gene elimination, in this sequence into a plasmid and further in producing a recombinant plasmid by then inserting an exogenous gene for a biological substance into the site between both of the fragments which is the former site where the polyhedrin gene was present. For instance, the upstream portion, after treatment with Where deletions are found in and around the translational start codon for the polyhedrin gene and in and around the translational termination codon, by comparison with the DNA sequence given hereinafter they may be filled by supplementary addition of synthetic DNAs or by For the production of useful substance, there have been reported a variety of genes and, besides, it is expected that isolation of many natural genes and synthesis of such and other genes will be reported in the future. It will be easily understood that all of them can be used in the practice of the present invention. Useful substances include biologically active material, e.g., peptides, proteins and glycoproteins, e.g., lymphokines such as α interferon, β interferon, γ interferon, TNF and interleukins, hormones such as insulin and human growth hormone, vaccines such as human hepatitis A and B, and influenza vaccines, and other materials such as TPA, somatomedins, colony stimulating factors. In general the translational start codon ATG can be joined to these genes for useful substance production prior to subsequent procedural steps. A recombinant plasmid is then produced by inserting a gene for the production of a useful substance, with a polylinker, which contains restriction sites of The recombinant plasmid obtained in the above manner can itself be used for the transformation of Escherichia coli and be propagated therein. It is not always necessary for the 5 upstream fragment containing the promoter region to retain the base sequence originally occurring in the BmNPV DNA. Similar expression rate can be expected even when the fragment has been more or less modified. The typical TATA box said to be present in the promoter region in general cannot be identified in a definite manner in that portion of the BmNPV DNA which is upstream from ATG of the structural gene for polyhedral protein. However, as shown in Example C 2 hereinafter and the succeeding examples as well as in Table 1, some deficiencies in the region upstream from ATG, namely deletions in 7 to 1 bp, 18 to 1 bp and 19 to 1 bp, have no substantial influence on the excellent effect which is obtainable without such deletions. A satisfactory result can be produced also with deletion in 29 to 1 bp. On the other hand, deletion in 82 to 1 bp results in a tendency toward a considerably reduced effect. Therefore, the vicinity of the 80 base from ATG appears to already include an important promoter region. The 5 upstream DNA, which comprises a combination of the promoter region and an upstream DNA useful for viral DNA recombination, may be variable in length. For instance, it can have a length in the range of several hundred to about 10 kilo base pairs which precede ATG. More specifically, as will be mentioned later herein, the use of that portion of the The DNA sequence located upstream from the promoter region and the 3 downstream DNA sequence downstream from the structural gene for the polyhedral protein are important as keys for the production of a recombinant virus by insertion of a gene coding for a useful substance with the translational start codon for the exogenous gene coding for useful substance into the BmNPV DNA as described later. Thus, mixed infection with the BmNPV DNA and a recombination DNA for transfer e.g., plasmid which has a DNA fragment containing a gene coding for a useful substance and, upstream and downstream from this gene, DNA sequences homologous to the respective counterparts in the BmNPV DNA results in crossover and transfer of the gene coding for the biological substance to the BmNPV DNA due to the homology in the key portions to provide a recombinant BmNPV DNA. The determination, modification and utilization of the respective DNA sequences in the portions upstream and downstream from the structural gene for the polyhedral protein are by no means difficult for one skilled in the art to perform when the description given hereinabove and hereinbelow as well as in the examples is referred to. One skilled in the art can understand and practise the relevant techniques, however detailed they might be, with only routine experimentation. It is to be noted that any mode of embodiment which is practicable in that manner falls within the scope of the present invention. By using the above mentioned recombinant plasmid, various methods can be used to produce a recombinant BmNPV DNA containing the gene coding for a biological substance. For instance, one method is conducted The above mixed infection may also be effected in the silkworm. By infecting Bm cells In accordance with the invention, it is thus possible to produce useful peptides, proteins and glycoproteins safely and economically in large quantities. In accordance with the invention, a peptide or protein is produced in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, when a gene derived from an eukaryote is used, the peptide or protein produced can undergo the same modifications as those which occur Furthermore, mankind has years of experience in silkworm raising and a huge accumulation of research results, so that large scale silkworm culture is easy to perform. Today it is also possible to raise the silkworm on artificial feed e.g., Vita Silk , a product of Vita Silk Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan . Therefore, the production of biological substances at the living organism level using viral vectors is presumably by far more suited for industrial purposes and more economical than the production of such substances at the cell level. The following examples in which the production of α interferon α INF , a protein useful as a drug, using the α INF gene as the gene for biological substance production is described, will illustrate a mode of practice of the present invention in further detail. It is to be noted, however, that the examples are by no means intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Silkworms The strain T3 was propagated in Bm cells and then used for percutaneous inoculation for infection of silkworms at the fifth instar. Six days later, the infected tissue containing polyhedra formed, with distilled water added thereto, was centrifuged, and the sediment was suspended in distilled water and triturated. The polyhedra were purified by fractional centrifugation 3,000 rpm, 30 minutes and discontinuous density gradient centrifugation 45 and 55 w w sucrose solutions, 20,000 rpm, 30 minutes . The polyhedrin suspension was subjected to fractional centrifugation for sucrose solution removal 3,000 rpm, 10 minutes , the purified polyhedra were suspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate pH 11 0.05 M sodium chloride and treated at 25 C for 30 minutes to thereby cause release of viral particles. This viral suspension was subjected to 10 to 40 w w sucrose density gradient centrifugation 18,000 rpm, 30 minutes for purification. The sucrose was removed by dialysis or fractional centrifugation 40,000 rpm, 30 minutes to give purified viral particles. To the thus obtained virus containing solution, there were added SDS sodium lauryl sulfate, 1 w w and protease K Merck, 1 mg ml . After about 2 hours of incubation at 37 C, an equal volume of a phenol solution saturated in 10 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer pH 7.6 1 mM EDTA was added to the above solution, and the mixture was gently shaken for about 5 minutes and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The aqueous layer was taken, and the same phenol treatment was repeated twice. To this DNA containing aqueous layer was added an equal volume of chloroform, followed by gentle shaking for about 5 minutes and centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes. The aqueous layer was taken, the same chloroform treatment was repeated twice, and the aqueous layer was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer pH 7.6 1 mM EDTA for about 2 days. The viral DNA thus obtained ATCC No. 40188 was used in the subsequent gene clothing and Bm cell transfection. Probe preparation Silkworms at the fifth instar were percutaneously infected with the strain BmNPV T3. Several days later, whole RNA was extracted from the fat body tissue by the guanidine hydrochloride method and purified using an oligo dT cellulose column to give a poly A containing mRNA. This mRNA was examined using the Cloning of polyhedrin gene containing These EcoRI digestion products from the viral DNA and pBR322 were subjected to ligation at 5 C for 10 hours with T4 ligase added. The ligation product was introduced into commercially available A The plasmid p9H18 was cleaved with pUC9 was treated with Similarly, p9B series plasmids were produced. That is, the ones lacking in the 82 base pairs, 19 base pairs, 18 base pairs and 7 base pairs upstream from ATG and in ATG and the following were named p9B587, p9B310, p9B276 and p9B585, respectively, and the one lacking in the 23 bp downstream from ATG was named p9B312. The base sequence of the region concerned is shown in Figure 4. The plasmid p9B241 was treated with i The leukocyte IFN gene was searched for from among a human genome λ phage Charon 4A recombinant library Lawn et al., In this plasmid, an upstream from the polyhedrin gene portion from a base pair about 3 kb upstream to 30 base pair was followed by a 13 bp residue of the linker used in constructing the plasmid p89B241, then by the α IFN J gene beginning with ATG and inserted in the correct direction and further by a downstream from the polyhedrin gene portion from a base pair about 300 bp downstream from the termination codon to a base pair about 3.1 kb downstream from said base pair . pIFN 2 B587, pIFN 2 B310, pIFN 2 B276 and pIFN 2 B585 were constructed in the same manner using p89B587, p89B310, p89B276 and p89B585, respectively, as starting materials. Chemical Synthesis of Oligodeoxyribonucleotides According to the method described in H. Ito et al. The plasmid pBM 030 was prepared from the plasmid p9B 312 as shown in Figure 6. This plasmid has the promoter region and terminator region originally occurring in BmNPV except for three base pairs 3 bp and has a polylinker between these regions instead of the polyhedral gene as shown in Figure 7. In Figure 6, the method of preparing p9M312 from p9B312 is known as To the vector pBM030 , the α IFN gene was inserted by the process shown in Figure 9 to produce pBM034. The BmNPV T3 strain viral DNA ATCC No. 40188 and pIFN 1 B241, in a proportion of 1 100, were mixed with the solutions I and II having the following compositions, respectively A 1 ml portion of the resultant suspension was added to 4 ml of a Bm cell culture medium to thereby introduce the above DNA into cells of Silkworms on day 1 of the 5th instar were percutaneously injected with the medium recovered after 5 days of cultivation as described in F or with the medium recovered after 5 days of cultivation following infection with the single viral strain at a dose of 0.5 ml head 10⁷ pfu and then fed on mullberry leaves at 25 C for 5 days. Thereafter, a collecting needle was stuck into the abdominal appendage and the body fluid was collected into an ice cooled Eppendorff tube. The body fluid, with an equal volume of TC 10 medium added, was centrifuged 10,000 rpm, 5 minutes and the supernatant was assayed for α IFN activity. According to the method of C. Philip et al. Methods After purification with an antibody column, the N terminal end of α IFN produced in silkworm using pB034 was determined. The terminal eleven amino acids corresponded to those of the standard α IFN. This means that the silkworm cell recognizes correctly the signal sequence of the human protein and expression is conducted in the cell with accurate processing. The phage charon 4A recombinant library of the human genome was screened for β IFN gene. The thus obtained DNA containing the β IFN gene was cleaved by HindII, and β IFN gene containing fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated to the Using thus obtained recombinant BmNPV, expression was conducted in silkworm by the same method as described in G. above. When activity of β IFN was determined using standard sample of β IFN by the method in H., it was found that the recombinant BmNPV produced about 8 x 10⁵ U ml and 8 x 10⁴ U ml of β IFN in the haemolymph and Bm cell, respectively. The IFN produced by the recombinant virus was neutralized with a monoclonal antibody to human β IFN.
