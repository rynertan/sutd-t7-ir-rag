# Well treatment apparatus.

## Abstract
Well treatment apparatus, such as an isolation gravel packer, includes a housing 700 which has a stinger receptacle 748 disposed therein. The stinger receptacle has an open upper end 750 and an inner cylindrical seal bore 756 for sealingly receiving a concentric inner tubing string 758 therein for delivering a treatment fluid thereto. A treatment fluid passage 762 is disposed laterally through the housing for communicating an interior of the stinger receptacle at an elevation below the seal bore with the well zone to be treated. First and second external seals are disposed on an exterior of the housing above and below the treatment fluid passage 762 , respectively, for sealing between the housing and a liner bore. The housing also preferably includes a combination bypass passage and return fluid passage 806 disposed therein which is isolated from the treatment fluid passage. Treatment fluid is flowed from a surface location down through the concentric inner tubing string, then through the treatment fluid passage to the well zone. Return fluid flows from the well zone upward through the combination bypass passage and return fluid passage, then through an annulus between an outer tubing string and the concentric inner tubing string to the surface location.
