# Instrument for measuring the photosynthetic activities of plants.

## Abstract
An instrument 2 for simultaneously measuring a plurality of parameters indicative of photosynthetic activity of a leaf in vivo comprises a a gas tight chamber 4 for enclosing the leaf 5 , b means 10 for illuminating the leaf within the chamber with modulated light not capable of driving photosynthesis, c means 14 for detecting modulated fluorescence emis sion from the leaf, d means for illuminating the leaf with photosynthetically active light, e means 43 for measuring the light absorbed by the leaf, f and means 32 for measuring the rate of uptake of carbon dioxide gas by the leaf. The instrument may also comprise means for measuring the rate of loss of water by the leaf, and for measuring the tempera ture in the chamber. The invention includes a method of simultaneously measur ing a plurality of parameters indicative of photosynthetic activity of a leaf in vivo.
