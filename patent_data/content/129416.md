# FLOORING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A flooring system has a corrugated base sheet 10 onto which concrete can be poured. An upwardly facing channel 12 has selectively associated cover means 30 and can be partitioned 14 to define tunnels 12A, 12B for services such as electrical wiring. The cover means 30 need extend only between outlet units and or junctions with transverse overly ing feeder ducting 22 . Junction box units 62 can afford access to the junctions at which service segregation can be maintained 26, 28 .
