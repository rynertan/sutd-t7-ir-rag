# Improvements relating to security equipment.

## Abstract
Security equipment comprising a plurality of normally open contacts S1, S2, S3 and or normally closed con tacts S5 connected in a loop circuit to a central control circuit 1 . Each pair of switch contacts has a respective resistor R101, R102, R103, R105 connected in parallel therewith and the control circuit is operable to detect chan ges in resistance due, for example, to an intruder operat ing one of the switches. The equipment of the invention avoids the need for a separate monitoring circuit.
