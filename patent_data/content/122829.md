# LIGHT DIRECTING FACEPLATE LIGHT DIRECTING FACEPLATE

## Abstract
A directional face plate for a display device is provided in which the face plate itself is made of a fiber optic media 13 . Optical images produced on an inside surface 25 of the face plate 13 are transferred and reproduced at an outside sur face 16 . This enables a geometic directional filter 26 to be placed directly on a surface 16 upon which an image is produced. The fiber optic filter 13 provides a certain amount of directional filtration and therefore enhances the effect of the directional filter 26 , as well as permitting the geometric directional filter 26 to be placed directly on an image bearing surface 16 . Further advantages include the ability to provide a flat geometric filter 26 while ignoring the effects of placing an image generating substance 14 on a curved surface 25 .
