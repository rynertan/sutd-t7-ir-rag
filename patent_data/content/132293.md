# Synthesis of higher polyol fatty acid polyesters using high soap polyol ratios.

## Abstract
An improved solvent free transesterification provess for producing higher polyol fatty acid polyesters is dis closed. In this process a mixture of a polyol, a fatty acid methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl or benzyl ester, an alkali metal fatty acid soap, and a basic catalyst, having a molar ratio of soap polyol of from about 0.6 1 to about 1 1, preferably from about 0.75 1 to about 1 1, is heated to form a homogeneous melt. To this melt is subsequently added excess fatty acid methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl or benzyl ester, yielding the desired polyol fatty acid polyesters.
