# Cooling apparatus.

## Abstract
The method includes the step of recirculating air, previously passed over the product to be cooled, back onto the product by the use of modulating dampers in ducting of an air supply chamber, an air extraction chamber, and in recirculation ducting connecting the air supply and air extraction ductings together. The apparatus comprises an air delivery chamber and an air extraction chamber which together define a cooling zone, said delivery chamber and said extraction chamber each having a fan and said air delivery chamber having a perforated face plate through which air is delivered into said cooling zone, said delivery chamber and said extraction chamber being connected together by ducting, and a plurality of mutually co operable dampers in said ducting for selectively controlling the amount of humidified air passing from said extraction chamber to said delivery chamber and exhaust and for selectively controlling the amount of air from atmosphere being delivered to said delivery chamber.
