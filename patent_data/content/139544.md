# A method of dispensing coins and a coin dispenser.

## Abstract
A method of dispensing coins and a coin dispenser are intended for use in a vending machine to give coins as change when coins inserted into the vending machine to release goods have a greater value than the price of the goods purchased. A plurality of coin tubes 2,3,4 each having a different diameter extend substantially vertically and are each arranged to receive a stack of coins of a different value. A respective dispensing mechanism 200 for each tube is actuated by way of a respective actuator 300 and comprises a pivotable flap 10 arranged in its initial position to extend across the bottom open end of the tube and support the stack of coins therein. A respective slide 7 is associated with each tube 2,3,4 and is arranged to withdraw the coin or coins immediately above the bottommost coin or coins to be dispensed partially out of the stack such that the withdrawn coins support the stack. Pivoting of the flap 10 out of its initial position then releases the bottommost coin or coins.

## Description
A METHOD OF DISPENSING COINS AND A COIN DISPENSERThe present invention relates to a method of dispensing coins and to a coin dispenser.Throughout this specification the term coin is used to refer to both coins used as currency and to tokens.It is often required to reliably dispense coins, for example, as change from a vending machine or as prizes from gaming machines.Usually, the coins to be dispensed are arranged in vertical coin tubes, each tube holding a stack of coins of a single denomination.When a coin is to be dispensed the bottommost coin is moved from the bottom of the stack.The dispenser needs to be able to reliably dispense a single coin at a time. Thus it is necessary to provide means to reliably engage and remove the bottommost coin. Accordingly, in the previously known coin di spensers the parts of the di spenser have to be made to close tolerances and it is expensive to change the dispenser to deal with a different coin or coin set.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of dispensing coins from a coin stack received in a substantially vertical coin holder, comprising the steps of supporting the bottommost coin or coins to be dispensed at the bottom of the holder below withdrawing means, moving the coin or coins in the stack immediately above the coins to be dispensed substantially transversely of the holder by way of the withdrawing means such that the withdrawn coin or coins support the stack, and removing support from the bottommost coin or coins such that these coins are released.Preferably, said withdrawing means are movable transversely of the holder from an initial position to a withdrawn position in which the coin or coins immediately above the coins to be dispensed have been withdrawn and said withdrawing means also support the stack.Generally, it is only required to dispense the single bottommost coin during each dispensing operation. However, one or more coins can be moved by the withdrawing means.In a preferred embodiment the bottommost coin is supported in a gap of substantially the same height as that of the coin defined at the bottom of the holder between movable supporting means and the withdrawing means. After a coin has been released by movement of the supporting means, the supporting means are moved back into the supporting position and the withdrawing means are returned to their initial position. The return movement of the withdrawing means is arranged to enable the bottommost coin in the stack to move into said gap.Preferably, the withdrawing means comprises a slide in which an aperture of sufficient size to allow a coin to pass therethrough is arranged. The withdrawing means is movable between an initial position in which the aperture is within the coin holder and a withdrawn position in which part of the aperture is moved out of the coin holder.The present invention also extends to a coin dispenser comprising at least one substantially vertical coin holder arranged to receive a stack of coins, and a dispensing mechanism arranged at the bottom open end of the coin holder and movable between an initial position in which it supports the stack of coins and a dispensing position in which the bottommost coin or coins are released, the dispensing mechanism comprising withdrawing means arranged to move the coin or coins in the stack immediately above the coin s to be dispensed substantially transversely of the holder, and movable support means arranged beneath the withdrawing means and spaced therefrom to define a gap for receiving the coin or coins to be dispensed. Preferably, the withdrawing means are arranged to withdraw the coin or coins immediately above the coin s to be dispensed partially from the stack such that the withdrawn coins support the further coins in the stack. As the rest of the stack is thereby supported, the support means can be moved out of the supporting position thereof whereby the coin s to be dispensed will be released.Of course, the dispensed coins can be subsequently guided as is required.Generally, it is only required that a single coin be dispensed from the stack during each dispensing operation. Thus, the gap defined by the support means and the withdrawing means is substantially equal in height to the height of a coin to be dispensed.Preferably, in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism, the withdrawing means are arranged to hold the support means in the supporting position thereof, and wherein the withdrawing means are movable transversely of the holder to a withdrawn position in which the support means are released.In a preferred embodiment, the withdrawing means comprises a slide in which an aperture of sufficient size to allow a coin to pass therethrough is arranged. The withdrawing means is movable between an initial position in which the aperture is within the coin holder and a withdrawn position in which part of the aperture is moved out of the coin holder. The support means is pivotally mounted to extend, in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism, across the open bottom end of the coin holder.It will be appreciated that in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism, the stack of coins is supported by the support means. In the dispensing position the stack, except for the bottommost coin, is supported by the withdrawing means and the coins withdrawn thereby. Accordingly, it is preferred that the withdrawing means and the support means be interengaged to ensure maximum reliability.In an embodiment, the withdrawing means are arranged, in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism, to hold the support means in the supporting position thereof, transverse movement of the withdrawing means to the withdrawn position being arranged to release the support means. The slide may carry one or more hooks arranged to engage the support means in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism. In addition, return of the withdrawing means can also be arranged to return the support means to the supporting position thereof.In an embodiment, the support means and the withdrawing means are arranged to have interengaging surfaces such that return of the withdrawing means returns the support means by cam action to the supporting position thereof. Preferably, actuating means are provided for causing actuation of the dispensing mechanism. For example, a solenoid actuator coupled to the slide of said withdrawing means may be provided.In general, a coin dispenser would be required to dispense coins of more than one denomination. Thus, the dispenser would have two or more coin holders, each arranged to receive a stack of coins of a respective value, and each provided with a respective dispensing mechanism. Preferably, the coin holders are vertically extending coin tubes horizontally aligned and mounted by a common casing.An embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an exploded perspective view of a three coin change dispenser of the invention, Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section through one of the change tubes showing its associated dispensing mechanism,Figures 3 to 5 show the dispensing mechanism of Figure 2 at sequential stages in a dispensing operation,Figure 6 shows a plan view from above of a slide of a dispensing mechanism,Figure 7 shows a plan view of a slide similar to that shown in Figure 6 for use with a coin of larger diameter,Figure 8 shows a section through the slide of Figure 7,Figure 9 shows a side elevation of a flap of a dispensing mechanism, andFigure 10 shows a plan view from above of the flap of Figure 9.Figure 1 shows an exploded perspective view of a three coin change dispenser 100. This dispenser is intended for use in a vending machine to give coins as change when coins inserted into the vending machine to release goods have a greater value than the price of the goods purchased.The dispenser 100 illustrated has three coin holders in the form of tubes 2, 3 and 4, preferably moulded of plastics material. These tubes 2, 3 and 4 extend vertically in a housing of plastics material defined by a top moulding 1, a bottom moulding 6, and a main body 5.The tubes 2, 3 and 4 each have a different diameter and each is arranged to receive coins of a different value, Each tube will contain a stack of coins, all the coins in the stack being of the same value.A respective dispensing mechanism is associated with each of the tubes 2. 3. 4 and is arranged to support the coins in the stack within that tube. When it is required to dispense one of the coins for a change giving operation, the dispensing mechanism is arranged to enable the bottom coin in the associated stack to be dispensed whilst continuing to support the remaining coins. Each of the dispensing mechanisms is supported by way of base moulding 13 connected to the bottom moulding 6.The top moulding 1, the bottom moulding 6 and the base 13 are each provided with circular apertures therein associated with the respective change tubes 2,3,4. The apertures associated with each change tube are mutually aligned and arranged to be substantially coaxial with the respective change tube.The three dispensing mechanisms 200 each have the same basic structure although the size and shape thereof varies to conform with the size of the coins received in the associated change tube 2,3 or 4. The structure of the dispensing mechanism 200 associated with the change tube 2 is described in detail below.The dispensing mechanism 200 includes withdrawing means in the form of a slide 7 arranged between the bottom moulding 6 and the base 13 for sliding movement relative thereto. The slide 7 extends substantially horizontally across the bottom of the associated tube 2 and has a circular aperture 18 formed therein. In the initial position of the dispensing mechanism, the aperture 18 would be arranged substantially coaxially relative to the tube 2.The dispensing mechanism 200 also includes a flap 10 arranged to support the coins arranged in a stack 24 within the tube 2. The flap 10 has pivot pins 20 engaged in corresponding slots 21 provided in the base 13 such that the flap is pivotable relative to the base 13.In the normal return position of the dispensing mechanism 200 the flap 10 extends beneath the base 13 to close the bottom of the tube 2. The flap 10 is held in this closed position by way of hooks 7a extending from the underneath surface of the slide 7. These hooks 7a extend through the base 13 through elongate slots 23 provided therefor.Thus, it will be seen that in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism 200 which is shown in Figure 2, the stack of coins 24 within the tube 2 is supported by the flap 10 which in turn is supported by the hooks 7a of the slide 7.An actuating mechanism is associated with each dispensing mechanism.Only the actuating mechanism 300 associated with the dispensing mechanism 200 is illustrated, but the basic structure of all the actuating mechanisms will be substantially the same. The actuating mechanism 300 comprises a solenoid 14 supported by the body 5 and having a solenoid rod 14a to which a latch 16 is connected. A compression spring 15 is supported around the rod 14a and urges the latch 16 downwardly. A lever 17 carries pivot pins 25 which engage in slots provided in the latch 16. A second pair of pivot pins 26 of the lever 17 are engaged in slots 27 defined in the body 5.The lever 17 has a downwardly extending lug 17a which is engaged in a recess 28 formed in the upper surface of the slide 7.When it is required to dispense a coin from the tube 2 the solenoid 14 of the actuating mechanism 300 is energised such that it moves the rod 14a against the action of the return spring 15. As is seen inFigure 3, this upward movement of the rod 14a and hence of the latch 16 pivots the lever 17 such that its lug 17a moves laterally away from the tube 2. Because the lug 17a is engaged in the recess 28 the slide 7 is withdrawn and the coin or coins from the stack 24 which were within the aperture 18 of the slide 7 are also moved relative to the stack. As can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 the coins in the stack are then supported both by the coins withdrawn by the slide 7 and by the periphery of the slide 7. Withdrawal of the slide 7 is arranged to pivot the flap 10 out of its coin supporting position. In this respect, the transverse extent of the hooks 7a of the slide 7 is arranged such that when the slide 7 is in its fully withdrawn position, shown in Figure 4, the hooks 7a no longer engage the flap 10. The flap 10 is thus free to pivot about its pins 20. The weight of the coin which has remained supported by the flap 10 will assist in pivoting the flap 10. It should also be noted that the slide 7 is provided with a shaped notch 29 in its lower surface. This notch is arranged such that when the slide 7 is withdrawn to its maximum extent as shown in Figure 4 it receives a cam surface 30 formed on the upper surface of the flap 10.A side elevation of the flap 10 is shown in Figure 9 and it will be seen therefrom that the upper surface of the flap 10 carries a disc 31. This disc 31 generally has a diameter just a little smaller than that of the coins to be stacked in the tube 2. The thickness A of the disc 31 is chosen such that in the initial position of the dispensing mechanism as shown in Figure 2, only a single coin 24a can be accommodated between the lower surface of the slide 7 and the upper surface of the disc 31. Thus, as shown in Figures 2 to 4, withdrawal of the slide 7 withdraws at least the next to bottom coin in the stack 24 such that that coin and all the coins supported thereabove are prevented from leaving the stack. This withdrawal of the slide 7 releases the bottommost coin 24a such that as the flap 10 is pivoted the bottommost coin 24a can fall from the stack as shown in Figure 4. After the bottommost coin has been released, the solenoid 14 is de energised and the spring 15 returns the latch 16 and hence the lever 17 to the initial position. The notch 29 of the slide 7 and the cam surface 30 of the flap 10 are arranged to cooperate such that return of the slide 7 to its original position pivots the flap 10 back into its initial position. The return stroke is shown in Figure 5 and it will be appreciated that as the flap 10 and slide 7 attain their initial positions, the hooks 7a of the slide will once again re engage beneath the flap 10 to support the flap. In addition, at the final part of the return stroke, the slide 7 will once again across the tube 2 in a position in which its aperture 18 is aligned with the tube 2 such that the bottommost coin of the stack can then drop and attain the position of coin 24a as shown in Figure 2.The coin dispenser illustrated has been designed so that it can easily be altered to cope with different coins. In this respect, it is envisaged that the same outside housing made up of parts 1, 5 and 6 will be used in most situations. Thus, the diameters of the circular apertures in the top and bottom mouldings 1 and 6 would not generally be equal to the internal diameters of the respective tubes, although they would be axially aligned therewith.To enable the change dispenser to dispense coins of differing diameters, the tubes 2, 3 and 4 would be replaced by tubes having different internal diameters. However, normally the external diameters of the tubes would remain the same. Similarly, the external profiles of each of the slides 7, 8 and 9 would remain the same but slides having apertures of different diameters would be used. The bottom moulding 13 would be replaced by a similar part having apertures of different diameters.Figures 6 and 7 show plan views of two examples of the slide 7. In this respect, it will be seen that the external profile and size of the slide 7 is the same in each case but that the diameter B of the aperture 18 is larger than the diameter C of the aperture 78a. Figure 8 shows a transverse section through the slide 7 of Figure 7 in which the notch 29 and the recess 28 are clearly shown.It will be appreciated that the coin dispenser shown in Figure 1 is capable of handling a large number of different combinations of coins by using tubes of different diameters and providing the slides of the associated dispensing mechanisms with apertures of different diameters.Furthermore, as the external profiles of these elements remains the same the fabrication of elements to cope with different sizes of coins is simple.Figure 9 shows a side elevation of the flap 10. When changing the dispenser to cater for different size coins it is only necessary to change the flap 10 for one having a disc 31 of the appropriate thickness. It is not generally necessary to alter the diameter of the disc 31 or to alter the exterior profile or size of the flap 10.As can be seen in Figure 1, the dispensing mechanisms associated with the smaller diameter tubes 3 and 4 do incorporate flaps and slides having a modified shape as compared with that of the elements of the dispensing mechanism 200. A plan view from above of the flaps 10 of the dispensing mechanisms associated with the smaller diameter tubes is shown in Figure 10.It will be appreciated that the coin dispenser described is a very compact unit which can be simply and relatively inexpensively constructed. In view of the simplicity of the shape of the various parts, and as it is possible to cope with different sizes of coins by simply altering the sizes of apertures therein large combinations of different coins can be catered for cost effectively. Because the coins in the stack within a change tube assist in retaining the stack within the tube, the total travel of each of the slides can be kept small. This enables a shorter stroke solenoid to be used which in turn reduces the power required from the solenoid. Furthermore, as it is immaterial whether the slide withdraws one or more coins from the stack no close tolerances for the parts are required and there is no risk of jamming.The coin dispenser illustrated has three vertical tubes each fitted with an appropriate dispensing mechanism 200. Of course, more or less tubes each provided with an associated dispensing mechanism may be provided. However, it has been found that for most applications the ability to give change using three different coins is an optimum condition.
