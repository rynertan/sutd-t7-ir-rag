# The preparation of porous, pure silicon dioxide and of chromium oxide on silicon dioxide catalysts.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of porous silicon dioxide by converting a silicon dioxide obtained by flame hydrolysis into a gel, using at least the same quantity by weight of water which is mixed with at least 15 vol. of an alcohol with 1 5 carbon atoms, calculated in relation to the volume of the water in the gel, and this mixture is spray dried. The silica can then be made into a catalyst which is used in polymerizing olefins by placing on it a chromium compound and then heating in a non reducing atmosphere.
