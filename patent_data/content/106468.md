# Process for the chlorination of oxidic materials.

## Abstract
In the fluidised bed chlorination of oxidic materials, for example minerals such as bauxite, tantalite, columbite, wolframite or scheelite, the separation of metal values giving vaporous chlorides at the reaction temperature is enhanced by maintaining a zone substantially free of chlorine in the fluidised bed, for example a zone at least 0.25m in depth measured from the expanded bed surface. A high aspect ratio bed and counter current movement of the bed matter and the chlorine within the bed are preferably used.
