## Description
Composition for preparing cement concrete as well as asphalt concrete . This invention pertains to a composition for preparing cement concrete as well as asphalt concrete with new and original features. The object of the invention is to provide a composition which is usable for preparing the most varied concrete products or structures. It is mostly tried to obtain an improvement in the following properties of concrete products 1. Increasing the bending stress 2. Reducing to a negligible value the shrinkage 3. Increasing the pressure resistance 4. Increasing the shear stress and the ultimate stress 5. Reducing to unconsequent values those distortions due to temperature changes. To obtain such results according to the invention, the composition to be used both for cement concrete and asphalt concrete, besides the components of both said concrete kinds, further comprises at least one from the following additives a natural stones, b synthetic materials such as one or more of the following components foam ashes, furnace slags, expanded clay, sintered fly ashes, and expanded schists, c synthetic fibers. According to the invention said natural stones are comprised of one or more of the following components igneous rocks, stratified stones, and metamorphous stones. Advantageously, said fibers are comprised of polyester fibers, acrylic fibers, obtained by polycondensing a basic acid and a diol, or by self condensing a hydroxy acid. Preferably, the length of said fibers lies between 0.5 and 10 cm, and the thickness thereof is approximately l D Tex. Other details and features of the invention will stand out from the following description, given by way of non limitative example, of a composition for preparing both cement concrete and asphalt concrete. Concrete products or concrete structures for which the composition according to the invention may be considered, are building blocks, slabs, and any element which can be manufactured generally in the building industry or building trade on the basis of cement concrete or asphalt concrete. This does include naturally also road building and public works generally. The composition is thus usable for cement concrete and asphalt concrete, and comprises for both concrete kinds1 in arbitrary ratio sand, gravel and broken stones, or one such components. For cement concrete, use is made originally of the usual ratios of cement and water. For asphalt concrete, use is made originally of bitumen with strong binding properties. To the above mentioned compositions are added fibers. With the wording fibers there is meant here a polyester fibers, b acrylic fibers. Acrylic fibers are obtained by polycondensing of a dibasic acid. with a diol or by self condensing of hydroxraCid with spinning of the melt. Fibers which satisfy particularly well the required properties of the end product have a thickness which lies between 1 D Tex and 15 D Tex. The length of said fibers, whatever group they might belong to, lies between 0.5 and 10 cm. With such compositions, when starting from cement concrete or asphalt concrete, there are obtained any end products whatsoever, with any shape whatsoever, the resistance of which is markedly higher and sometimes twice as high, while bending stress, shear stress and ultimate stress are substantially increased and the shrinkage is nearly lowered to zero. It is also determined that with substantial temperature changes, the distortion is to be considered as ne iqible. All such properties lie even higher than usual with a lowering of the concrete volume. This means that the concrete as referred to the volume thereof, may be reduced while retaining the above mentioned properties. It is clear that the composition according to the invention is adapted to the most varied presently known uses. Shaped parts are to be pressed and vibrated due to the presence of the fibers. Compacting of the concrete mass wherein fibres comprise 0.1 to 10 by weight is a necessary requirement. It must be understood that the invention is in no way limited to the above embodiments and that many changes may be brought thereto, without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
