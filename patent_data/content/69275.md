# Apparatus for communicating with a fleet of vehicles.

## Abstract
A communication system is disclosed wherein plural base stations 12, 14,...22, 24 each communicate with plural associated mobile stations 26 in a variable but well disciplined single channel time division multiplexing arrangement. Each base station communicates to and from its associated mobile stations in an associated unitary communication cycle having time segments of variable size but allotted for specific purposes. The mobile stations include clocks which are all periodically synchronized by the base station. The base station transmits cycle timing infor mation at the beginning of each cycle so that the mobiles can determine by referring to their clocks when the various cycle segments begin and end. The number of mobile stations participating in a communication cycle with a given base station can vary as the mobiles move from the service area of one base station to the next. A particular time segment of each cycle is allocated for use by nonparticipating mobiles to transmit requests for participation in the cycles of the associated base station. The mobiles wait a random delay before transmitting their request, in order to reduce the danger of interfering transmissions of two mobiles both requesting participation in the same segment. A central traffic control center 28 mediates the operation of the system, causing the communication cycles of adjacent base stations to occur sequentially rather than concurrently to avoid interference.
