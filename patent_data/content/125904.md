# Electrochemical battery.

## Abstract
A battery of electrochemical cells employing several identical housing sections 10a 10d of conductive material stacked in a series arrangement with insulation 20, 21 bet ween them at the poin ts of connection, each two adjacent housing sections 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d form an enclosed chamber 25 . Each chamber contains the electrochemical system of an electrochemical cell with the anode members 26 in contact with one of the housing sections forming the chamber and the cathode members 27 in contact with the other of the housing sections forming the chamber. The elec trochemical cells within each chamber form a battery of cells arranged in series both physically and electrically with each housing section serving as the positive terminal for the cell of one chamber and the negative terminal for the cell of an adjacent chamber.
