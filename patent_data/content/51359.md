# Device to aid trimming an acetabular prosthesis.

## Abstract
To facilitate the trimming of flange 100 of a prosthesis 101 to fit closely into reamed out acetabulum 200 in hip bone 201, the aid comprises a body component 11 which corres ponds in overall shape to socket member 102 of the prosthesis and a separate flange 13 having a protrusion 14 engageable alternatively into socket 12 in the body compo nent 11 and socket 104 of the prosthesis. The entire aid is alternately offered into the acetabulum 200 and removed for trimming its flange 13, this being repeated until a good fit of the flange 13 into the acetabulum 200 is achieved. Then, the flange 13, removed from the body component 11, is fitted to the prosthesis 101 and the flange 100 of the prosthesis can then be trimmed straight away accurately for fitting into the acetabulum 200.
