## Description
Title Rotary Positive Displacement Machines. This invention relates to rotary positive displacement machines. Prior art machines and their disadvantages will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to III of the accompanying drawings Figs. 1 to III herein are prior art drawings, the purpose of which are tv illustrate certain problems with the prior art. Fis. 1 to III are similar to Fig.XIX of U.S. Patent 3,472,445. Referring to Fig. I, the diameter 3 of the first rotor hub is larger than diameter C of the second rotor hub and thus the radial dimension A between hub and casing is relatively small. Therefore, the flow of air or gas is restricted at dimension A and there is a throttling loss energy loss there. Another disadvantage with Figs. I to III prior art is that during a portion of each rotor rotation there is a dwell period during which no displacement occurs. The dwell period can be seen in Figs. n and V ofPatent 3,472,445 and lasts about 90 degrees. During the dwell period, no gas is drawn into the inlet port and the flow through same is completely stopped once per rotation. Thus, the flow of gas into the inlet port has a start stop start stop action which would have P detrimental effect on efficiency and noise Fig, XIX of Patent 3,472,445 is non workable as shown because the right rotor is not balanced and sever vibration would take place. It would be difficult to counterbalance same in a practical manner because the hub is so small in diameter and thus there is little room for counter weighting inside the small hub. In Fig. XIX of Patent 3,472,445 the groove in the left rotor hub and the lobe on the right rotor are both too small in their inclined angle to permit optimum performance as will subsequently be explained. Also inFig. XLX of Patent 3,472,445 the rotors have small angle left grooves and small angle right lobes which are disadvantageous as will be explained. The advantages sought for the specific embodiments of the invention are hereinafter specified with reference to Figs. IV to X of the accompanying drawings. 1. The first objective is to increase the area of the higher pressure ports 15 so as to reduce the throttling loss pressure drop through same. This objective is made possible by employing a larger diameter hub 6 on the first rotor and then a smaller diameter hub 8 on the second rotor. The ports 15 are opened and closed by the hub 6 and thus a larger diameter hub 6 permits the ports 15 to have a larger outer radius and thus be larger in area. 2. The second objective is to provide simple rotors but at the same time accomplish said first objective. The rotors are simple because they retain a constant and non helical cross section profile the full width of the rotors and there are no end plates on the rotors. This aids simplicity and reliability 3. The third objective is to make the rotors wider in axial length for a given R.P.M. This objective is made possible because of the increased area of the higher pressure ports 15 secured under the first objective. Without such increase in port area, the gas flow velocity through the ports due to wider rotors would cause a higher throttling loss pressure drop through the ports 15. 4. An advantage of the embodiments of this invention is that the cubic displacement per rotation of the rotors for a given diameter and width has been substantially increased. This advantage is obtained by employing rotors with double lobes instead of single lobes as will be described. 5. A fifth objective is to reduce the per cent leakage and thereby increase the energy efficiency of the machine. This objective is made possible because of the increased displacement per rotation as described in both of the previous paragraphs three and four and as will be subsequently described in more detail. 6. A sixth advantage of the embodiment is that the overall size and weight of the machine is less for a given capacity or output. This advantage is obtained because of the increased displacement per rotation as described in both of the previous paragraphs three and four and as will subsequently be described in more detail. 7. The seventh objective of the embodiments is to minimize a particular internal throttling loss pressure drop of the gas which flows between the large diameter first rotor hub and the casing as shown at A in Fif,li, prior art . This objective is now accomplished by employing two large angle grooves 10 instead of a single small angle groove in the first rotor hub as shown in Figs. IV to IX. The solution to this objective is simple in structure but complex in understanding and explanation is therefore subsequently explained in detail under its own separate heading. 8. Other objective for embodiments are to provide a second rotor 2 which has a small diameter hub 8 so as to secure objective number one , and a large angle lobe 9 so as to secure the advantages in paragraph number twelve , yet which can be balanced without resorting to a thin wall hollow rotor, and is structurally strong since it can be made of solid plate stock. All these objectives are achieved by employing two lobes per rotor instead of a single lobe per rotor. 9. Another objective for embodiments is to reduce the per cent of rotary shaft power transmitted through the two timing gears. 10. Another objective for embodiments is to arrive at and form a decision as to the optimum number of lobes on each rotor for this type of rotary machine ive.should there be one, two, three or four lobes per rotor.Should one rotor contain more lobes than the other rotor.It will be shown that the optimum combination is to employ exactly two lobes on each rotor. 11. Another objective for embodiments is to reduce a certain internal precompression and subsequent internal throttling loss when the machine is operated as a compressor as will subsequently be described in more detail under the description of Figs. IV and V. The internal compression and subsequent throttling listed in this paragraph number eleven is entirely separate from the internal throttling loss problem described in the preceding paragraph number seven. The objectives herein are to reduce both of these throttling losses. 12. A feature of the embodiments is that the lobes 9 on the secpnd rotor are made large in angle. In order to have large angle lobes 9 on the second rotor, it is also necessary to have large angle grooves 10 in the hub of the first rotor because the two interengage.Fortunately large angle grooves 10 in the hub of the first rotor have important advantages in their own right as was mentioned for objective number seven in the previous paragraph aph number seven. Thus, embodiments herein employ small angle lobes 7 on the first rotor to achieve objective number eleven , large angle lobes 9 on the second rotor so as to achieve this objective number twelve , and two large angle grooves 10 in the first rotor hub so as to achieve objective number seven . 13. An advantage not new is that the rotors and higher pressure ports 15 are profiled in such a way that the clearance volume is zero or near zero so that when operating as a compressor, the machine delivers through the ports 15 all the full pressure gas it compresses and none is throttled wasted back to inlet pressure except a small portion due to leakage and running clearance. This feature is not new to embodiments of this invention as it was described inU.S. Patent 3,472,445. The dump pockets 19 constitute a non delivered volume but the gas therein is dumped at a low pressure and not full discharge pressure as will be described therefore, the dump pockets 19 are not counted when determining clearance volume. 14. Another advantage not new is that there are no geometric leak paths such as are associated with some new screw type machines. 15. An unexpected feature of embodiments of this invention is that the displacement volume per rotor rotation with rotors having non equal hub diameters is almost equal to that of rotors having equal hub diameters.For example, the displacement volume of two 12 inch diameter rotors having hub diameters of 10.5 inches and 7.5 inches respectively is 97.5 per cent of that of two 12 inch rotors having equal 9 inch hub diameters.Thus, the penalty in loss of displacement by employing non equal diameter hubs is almost negligible. 16. Another advantage of embodiments of this invention as a compressor is that with two lobes per rotor instead of a single lobe the said dwell period has been eliminated and the flow of gas or air into the port 14 is much more steady in character so that the start stop start stop action of single lobe rotors has been eliminated. This will aid efficiency, reduce noise, and permit smoother running in general. 17. An advantage not new is that no oil is required directly on the rotors, and thus in a compressor the output air can be oil free. 18. An unexpected feature of embodiments of this invention is that the dump pockets 19 shown in Fig. VI have a very low energy loss. This loss due to dumping at low pressure is calculated to be less than one tenth of one per cent of the total adiabatic work of the machine as will be described for Fig. VI. 19. Another objective of embodiments of this invention is to provide a rotary machine having an operating pressure ratio as high as 3 to 1 per stage as will be described in the description of Fig. VII. Accordingly the present invention in its broad aspect provides a rotary positive displacement machine adapted to handle a working fluid, comprising a casing structure having two intersecting bores, a first rotor mounted for rotation in one said bore, a second rotor mounted for rotation in the other said bore, each rotor having a hub and at least two lobes, each lobe attached to a respective hub and projecting radially outward to the outer radius of the rotor, each hub having at least two grooves therein, each groove being located adjacent a respective lobe, timing gear means constraining said two rotors to rotate in opposite directions of rotation, said two rotors interengaging as they rotate, said two hubs being profiled so as to rotate in sealing relation to each other during a portion of each rotation, said casing structure having a lower pressure port for the passage of the working fluid at lower pressure, said casing structure also having a higher pressure port for the passage of the working fluid at higher pressure, said higher pressure port being located in an end wall of the bore containing said first rotor, the said hub of the first rotor and its grooves therein serving to alternately cover and uncover said higher pressure port so as to control the flow of the working fluid through the higher pressure port, characterised in that the outer radius of the hub of the first rotor is substantially larger than the outer radius of the hub of the second rotor, the outer radius of said higher pressure port being substantially larzer than the outer radius of the hub of the second rotor so as to increase the flow area of the pressure port, said outer radius of the higher pressure port being measured from the axis of rotation of the first rotor. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. I,II and III are prior art drawings which show prior art rotors in successive rotative positions so as to illustrate a throttling loss problem Figs. IV to It illustrate embodiments of this invention in which the rotors are shown in successive rotative positions, and, Fig. X illustrates the profiles of the rotors to a larger scale and shows timing gears. GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF EMBODIMEND6 OFTHIS INVENTION FIGS. IV to X A first rotor 1 and a second rotor 2 are rotatably mounted in the intersecting bores 3 and 4 in the casing structure 5. The first rotor has a large diameter hub 6 and two small angle teeth or lobes 7 projecting radially outward from the hub. The second rotor has a smaller diameter hub 8 and two larger angle teeth or lobes 9 projecting radially outward from the hub. The first rotor hub 6 has two large angle grooves 10 located therein and each groove 10 is located adjacent a respective lobe 7. The second rotor hub 8 has two smaller angle grooves 11 located therein and each groove 11 is located adjacent a respective lobe 9.Timing gears 12 and 13 Fig. X mounted on the rotor shafts constrain the two rotors to rotate in timed interengaging relation. When operating as a compressor, a source of power is applied to the second rotor so as to rotate the second rotor in the direction shown. A portion of the total power is then transmitted through the timing gears so as to rotate the first rotor in the opposite direction as shown. The working fluid or gas to be compressed enters the lower pressure port 14, is compressed internally within the machine, and is then delivered through two higher pressure ports 15 which are located one in each flat end wall of the casing structure. The ports 15 are alternately covered and uncovered by the first rotor 1 so as to control the flow of the working fluid through the ports.The compressed gas is then conducted from the two ports 15 to a common outlet not shown . Fig. IV shows the rotors at the start of compression in chamber 16. The smaller chamber 17 is near the end of delivery and is being closed out. To obtain zero or near zero clearance volume, all the gas in chamber 17 is to be delivered through the ports 15 so as to avoid wasting any compressed gas. To obtain this feature, the following requirements are needed a the trailing edge of port 15 should be a circular arc projected from or by the outer radius of the second rotor, b the convex face of the second rotor lobe should be tangent to the outer radius of the same lobe, and c the circumferential width of said convex face at the pitch circle should be at least as large as the radial height of said convex face from the pitch circle outward. This feature and the construction therefore was described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,472,445. Fig. V shows how chamber 16 and 18 equalize pressure after about 20 degrees rotation from Fig. IV.The precompression in chamber 18 is negligible due to the small angle lobes 7. Further, with large small hubs as set forth in embodiments of this invention Th volume of chamber 16 is larger than with equal nametpr hubs and thus the effect of precompression is even further reduced because the tip of lobe 7 projects briefly into an even larger volume 16 prior to release and thus the precompression pressure is released at even lower pressure. Fig. VII shows the rotor positions where the ports 15 are still covered by the first rotor. but will start to be uncovered in the next few degrees of rotor rotationThe rotor and port profiles shown in Figs. IV to IX are calculated and drawn to scale for a 3 to 1 pressure ratio. Thus in a two stage air compressor with atmospheric inlet , the discharge pressure of the second stage would be 3 x 3 x 14.7 132.3 PSLA 117 PSIG. The ports 15 start to be uncovered 20 degrees ahead of the theoretical pressure ratio of 3 location. Thus, during said 20 degrees, there is a slight amount of backflow of air from the discharge line back into the chambers 18 and 16.Such backflow represents a small energy loss which is more than compensated for in increased port area so that the net loss due to throttling through the ports 15 is less. The early opening of port 15 might be compared in a very general way to advancing the spark in an internal combustion engine. Embodiments of this invention teach the use of two lobes per rotor and no more. If for instance the machine instead had three or four lobes per rotor, then each lobe would have less angular distance to travel during the compression phase, and thus the discharge port 15 would have to be smaller in angle to secure the same built in pressure ratio a serious disadvantage. When operating as an expansion engine, rotation is reversed, high pressure motive gas is supplied to the ports 15 and the lower pressure exhaust gas leaves at 14. The ports 15 are referred to as the higher pressure ports and the port 14 is referred to as the lower pressure port since this designation is applicable for operation as both a compressor and an expansion engine. Most of the discussion herein pertains to operation as a compressor, however, those improvements described for a compression cycle would also benefit the operation as an expansion engine.DUMP POCKETS FIG. VI Fig. VI shows the rotors at the formation of dump pockets 19. The gas contained in the pockets 19 is only slightly pressurized and in about the next five degrees of rotor rotation this low pressure gas is dumped back to inlet pressure. In the first stage of an air compressor having a pressure ratio of 3 to 1 per stage, the calculated power loss due to dump pockets 19 is only 0.08 less than one tenth of one per cent of the adiabatic work of compression.The reasons for such an unexpectedly low power loss is due to dump pockets are a The calculated pressure at dumping is only 3 PSIG, b the volume of the dump pockets is 70 of the total displacement, and c the energy loss is that due to internal compression only as there is no loss due to delivery work since the 3 PSIG gas is merely dumped and not delivered. To calculate the energy loss due to dump pockets, proceed as follows The work of internal compression only no delivery is P272 P1V1 from any text on thermodynamics. Use absolute pressures.Deduct the area below the atmospheric line as this is not a work item.DETAILED DISCUSSION OF REDUCED PER CENT LEAKAGE ANDOVERALL SIZE Double lobe rotors have 18 more displacement than single lobe rotors even after deducting for the dump pockets previously described . This is because single lobe rotors have a dwell period during which no displacement occurs as can be seen in Figs. IV and V ofPatent No. 3,472,445. More displacement per rotation for a given rotor diameter and a given rotor width is a very desirable feature since it increases capacity and reduces per cent leakage. Thus all embodiments herein use double lobe rotors instead of single lobe rotors. It has been calculated that the leakage at the flat ends of the second stage rotors in one actual machine is 2.9 times the leakage along the width of the rotors.Therefore, it is desirable to make the rotors as wide in the axial direction as praticable so as to reduce the per cent leakage. The limiting factor in rotor width is RPM. The higher the EPM, the shorter must be the rotors in order to avoid undue throttling losses through the end ports 15. This is where the larger ports area described for the first objective is important. The larger port area permits the rotors to be wider for a given RPM and thus the machine has less per cent leakage and is more efficient. In a 3450 RPM air compressor having a pressure ratio of 3 to 1 per stage , a good rotor width for tli first stage rotors is four to five inches. Increased rotor width permits the machine to La more compact for a given capacity as follows If for example the width of a rotor is s doubled, then the capacity is more than doubled less per cent leak age but the overall size and weight of the machine is not doubled due to the space requirements of bearings, seals, timing gears, casing, etc. Conclusion Wider rotors made possible by increased port area permits the machine to be more compact for a given capacityDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF HOW OBJECTIVE NUMBER S IS ACCOMPLISHED As previously described, the hub diameter B Fig. VI is made larger so as to increase the area of the ports 15.A conflicting feature is that the radial dimension A becomes relatively small and thus the possibility of a throttling loss pressure drop at this point is of concern. A particular feature of this embodiment is that the throttling loss due to flow of the working fluid between the first rotor hub and the casing bore is much less Figs. IV to X than with the prior art Figs. I to III and the reasons thetefore aie expla in paragraphs a , b , c and d as follows a Figs. I, II, and III are prior art drawings wh A illustrate single lobe rotors in successive rotative positions. The porting shown is for 3 to 1 pressure ratio, Figs. IV to IX illustrate embodiments of invention with is for 3 to 1 pressure ratio The restriction At FigVI is no longer present in Figs.VIII and IX because the dimension D and E at the groove are mu large than dimension A at the hub hence less throttling pressure drop . With two grooves 10 and 10 per rotor instead of one the narrow restriction a is in effr a much smaller percentage of the time. b With two grooves 10 per rotor Instead of one the narrow restriction A is in effect during a less critical portion of the cycle during which there is internal compression and no flow through the ports 15 as will next be explained Figs. V, VI, and VII illustrate the rotor locations during which internal compression is taking place in chambers 16 and 18 and there is no flow from chambers 16 and 18 through the discharge ports. Therefore, in Figs V, VI, and VII the only flow past A the restriction is that due to the fact that the second rotor 2 is displacing air or gas at a faster rate than the first rotor 1 Therefore in Fig.V, VI, and VII the flow past A between hub and housing is due only to the difference in displacement rates of the two rotors since internal compression is taking place on both sides of the restriction A .Thus, in Figs. V, VI, and VII, the throttling loss d e to flow in the circumferential direction between the hub and casing bore is low because the flow rate past A t is low at these locations of the rotor cycle These embodiments of the invention are thus in contradistinction to the prior art wherein the rotors shown in Fig. III are long into the delivery portion of the rotor cycle, get the restriction A IS still i11 effect. Thus, in Fig.III, the prior art the i displacement rate of the right rotor must flow past restriction A , in the circumferential direction between the rotor hub and the casing bore. c Going a step further, the grooves 10 and 10 in the embodiments Figs. IV to I are larger in angle Z Fig. compared to the small angle groove in Fig.II the prior art. The large angle grooves 10 result in less restriction more of the time. In Fig. VIII, the restriction A is no longer in effect because dimension D at the groove is much larger than dimension at the hub , hence less throttling at Dl. Fig. IX illustrates how the large angle grooves 10 continue to present a wide open flow path E for the gas so as to reduce the problem described for Fig. I. the prior art which has only one small angle groove d The volume contained in the two large angle grooves 10 of embodiments of this invention is about 3 or 4 times the volume contained in the single small angle groove Fig. III of prior art . This means therefore that more volume is contained in the first rotor and less volume of gas needs to flow from right to left past the restriction these embodiments compared to the volume which must flow past restrictionA in Fig. III the prior art . Result Bess volume flow past the restriction means less pressure drop and thus the energy loss is reduced two ways which are 1 Less pressure drop hence less energy loss and 2 Bess volume flow hence less energy loss. To summarise the internal throttling loss problem at A in Figs. I to III the prior art has now been reduced in several ways which are 4 there are C two grooves in the first rotor instead of one, 2 the grooves are larger in angle , 3 during delivery portion of the rotor cycle when flow rates are higher the double grooves provide wider flow paths D and E and 4 less per cent volume flow through the restricttion means less energy loss. TITLE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF LOBES FOR EACH ROTOR IS TWO FOR THE FOllOWING SIX REASONS 1. Double lobe rotors have a net cubic displacement per rotation which is 1 greater than single lobe rotors. This is because single lobe rotors have a dwell period during which no displacement occurs as can be seen in Figs. IV and V of U.S. Patent 3,472,445. More displacement per rotation is a very desirable feature since it increases capacity and reduces per cent leakage and therefore double lobe rotors are for this reason preferable over single lobe rotos. 2. There is no point, however, in going to three lobes or four lobes per rotor as this would gain nothing further in displacement since said dwell period is eliminated in going from one lobe per rotor to two lobes per rotor. Three or four lobe rotors would cut down on the angle and thus area of the higher pressure ports for a given built in pressure ratio a serious disadvantage . Further, three or four lobe. rotors would be more expensive to make and more critical to time with timing gears. 3. If the rotors have two lobes per rotor instead of one then the dwell period is eliminated and the inlet flow as a compressor is more steady so as to avoid that stop start stop start flow action. 4. Embodiments of this invention are provided with two large angle grooves 10 instead of a single small angle groove A in the first rotor hub so as to reduce an internal throttling loss of the working fluid which flows in the circumferential direction between the first rotor hub and the casing bore as shown comparatively in Figs. III and IX and as was explained in detail under the previous beading. Two grooves 10 require two coacting lobes 9. This is another reason why double lobe rotors are advantageous over single lobe rotors. 5. In embodiments of this invention the second rotor hub 8 is small in diameter so as to get more port area controlled by the larger first rotor hub 6 .Embodiments of this invention have lobes 9 on the second rotor large in angle as previously explained . If the second rotor had only a single lobe as shown in Fig.XIX of patent 3,472,445 , and in addition that single lobe were large in angle heavy , then that rotor would be difficult to balance internally because such a small diameter hub would allow little space for a counterweight inside the hub so as to counterbalance the single large angle heavy lobe. If instead, the second rotor has two lobes as set forth in the embodiments herein then the balancing problem is solved and the rotor can be made from solid plate stock instead of thin wall hollow castings weaker and still retain the large angle lobes 9. This, then is another reason why the two lobes per rotor are preferred over a single lobe rotor. 6. Double lobe rotors have dump pockets Fig. VI but single lobe rotors do not have dump pockets and thus for several years this led me to believe that single lobe rotors were superior to double lobe rotors. tater on however, I calculated that the power loss due to dump pockets is less than one tenth of one per cent of the adiabatic work of compression a negligible amount as previously described. Even after deducting for the dump pockets 19, the displacement of double lobe rotors is still 18 io greater than single lobe rotors.TIMING GEAR POWER REDUCTION Referring to Fig. VII, the torque due to fluid pressure is less on the first rotor 1 than on the second rotor 2 and this is because the hub diameter 3 exceeds hubs diameter C. The following is a calculated example. Two 12 inch diameter rotors compress air from atmospheric pressure to 44.1 PSIA. The diameter of the first rotor hub is 10.5 inches 267 mm and the diameter of the second rotor hub is 7.5 inches 190 mm , The drive shaft is attached to the second rotor. The per cent of power transmitted through the timing gears throughout a 360 degree rotation equals 3W 0 of the total rotary shaft power input. If the rotors are designed to run at the same speed as a drive motor then the drive shaft should be attached to the second rotor so as to reduce timing gear power. If the rotors are designed to run at a fasterRPM than the drive motor, then a larger diameter drive gear may mesh with the timing gear on the second rotor shaft so as to drive same first and thereby reduce timing gear power.DESCRIPTION 0r FIG. X The rotors shown in Fig, x are the same as the Fig IV to It rotors but to a larger scale The , or exes are at X and Y. The arcs T N, U P, O R, H G, and X L are circular with centres at X and Y The I J are at the hub diameters Profiles O by tips G.

If two rotors rotate at the same rotative speed, then the pitch circles the two rotors are of equal diameter and each i circle has a diamter equal to the distance between the axes of rotation of the two rotors. Each pitch circle has its centre on the axis of rotation of its ive rotor.MODIFICATIONS NOT SHOWN The rotor hubs are shown to be m rc although other forms are possible suOli as spirals as long as the two hubs rotate proximity to each other. The two rotors are shown to have the sa ouver diameter and the two casing bores are sno n to be e although it would be possible to make the bigger in diameter than the first rotor two rotors rotate at equal rotative s e t Optionally, the first rotor may be provided with small notches at location 0 in the sides of the rotor so as to provide more port area particularly at the last portion of each delivery phase . In addition, the ports 15 would be modified radially inward slightly so as to register with the notches. The two rotors are shown to have straight profiles which are non heiical, and unlike screw machines, internal compression of the working fluid is made possible without the need of making the rotors helical.Rowever, helical rotors of low wrap angle could be used. While I have shown and described my invention in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is done only be way of example, and not as a limitation to the scope of my invention as set forth in the objects thereof and in the appended claims.
