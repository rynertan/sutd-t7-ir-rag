# METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THERMAL NEUTRON DECAY CHARACTERISTICS OF EARTH FORMATIONS

## Abstract
Methods for measuring thermal neutron decay charac teristics of earth formations include the steps of irradiating an earth formation with a discrete burst of fast neutrons, detecting indications of thermal neutron concentration in the formation during a sequence of discrete time gates, deter mining the zeroth order moment of the indications during the sequence of discrete time gates, and determining the first order moment of the indications during the sequence of dis crete time gates, in order to obtain the desired thermal neu tron decay characteristic of the earth formation.
