# Winning metal from ore.

## Abstract
Copper is won from chalcopyrite ore copper iron sul phide containing Cu II and Fe III , which respectively prefer square planar and octahedral co ordination. A vapourised tetradentate square planar Schiff base reagent is passed through a fluidised bed of oxidatively roasted chalcopyrite, and ignores the iron but forms a volatile copper complex. This is blown to a decompositon chamber containing a hot probe on which the complex decomposes, leaving the desired copper on the probe and liberating the Schiff base reagent for recycling.
