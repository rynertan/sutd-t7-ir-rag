# A closed loop bubble lattice system.

## Abstract
A bubble storage system includes a closed loop pro pagation pattern suitable for use with a bubble lattice. The closed loop propagation pattern 12A H is folded and contains, for example, segments of a hexagonal lattice 18 D, 20A D, 22A D, 24A D connected by 60 turns to obtain a close pack bubble storage configuration. The bubbles are propagated along the pattern consisting, pre ferably, of C bar or chevron type permalloy elements by a rotating magnetic field in the plane of the pattern. In a preferred embodiment, the folded closed loop propagation pattern is surrounded by a region of non propagating bubbles retained by permalloy dot confinement means 26 .
