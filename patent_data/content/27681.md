## Abstract
A nozzle ring assembly for use around a circular grinding path of a roller mill of the kind comprising a grinding table 1 which is rotatable about a vertical axis, and grinding rollers 2 urged against the grinding table. The nozzle ring assembly comprises a nozzle ring 8 with circumferentially spaced guide vanes 17 for directing air, in use, over the grinding path in a direction with a component substantially tangential to the grinding path. The nozzle ring 8 also has a set of annular guide vanes 13 16 which are disposed one above the other for directing air, in use, substantially horizontally over the grinding path.
