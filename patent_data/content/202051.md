## Description
This invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration encapsulated in a capsule dosage form and more particularly relates to such therapeutic preparations comprising coated pellets or spheroids which release a dose of an active medicinal substance at different times in the digestive system of a patient. Timed disintegration capsules for the sequential, timed release of medicinal substances into a patient s system are known in the art. Generally such capsules or tablets consist of particles containing the medicinal substance to be introduced into the system, and a coating over the particles of a material which is resistant to disintegration for a selected period of time. Such coating compositions are also referred to as enteric coating compositions, that is, compositions which are generally resistant to disintegration in the stomach, but which disintegrate in the intestine. Enteric compositions also include compositions which disintegrate slowly in the stomach such that the medicinal substance is not released until the capsule or tablet has reached the intestine of the patient. For example, coatings comprising bees wax and glyceryl monostearate bees wax, shellac and cellulose and cetyl alcohol, mastic and shellac have been proposed for use as slow release or timed release coatings for medicinal substances. Release of the medicinal substance by disintegration of the coating is generally controlled by varying the thickness of the coating or by altering its composition. United States Patent No. 2,809,918 discloses inert drug coated nonpareils which are enteric coated with a shellac stearic acid mixture. United States Patent No. 3,119,742 discloses coated drug crystals used as particulates for sustained release formulations. United States Patent No. 2,921,883 discloses Spansule, nonenteric coated spheroids designed for sustained release. United States Patent No. 3,835,221 discloses oral delayed action globules coated with a mixture of polyvinylacetate and ethyl cellulose, useful as an inert carrier core. F.W.Goodhart et al., Pharmaceutical Technology, page 64 71, April 1984, discloses the evaluation of Eudragit E 30 D as an aqueous film forming dispersion for controlled release of phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride. The prior art compositions have generally proved deficient in the case where the medicinal substance is extensively metabolized presystemically or has a relatively short elimination half life resulting in sub therapeutic plasma levels. Also, with many patients, the coatings are not disintegrated to the extent necessary to release the medicinal substance until the tablet or capsule has reached the colon and the medicinal substance is discharged from the system rather than absorbed by the intestine. The present invention particularly concerns three repeated releases of a medicinal substance for once daily administration of those medicinal substances which are extensively metabolized presystemically or have relatively short elimination half lives. This system results in superior oral bioavailability as compared to a continuous release system for a medicinal substance over a 6 to 24 hour period. The present invention also provides the convenience of not requiring the administration of divided doses during a 24 hour period and results in better patient compliance. The medicinal agents particularly useful in the invention are those that exhibit a significant presystemic metabolism or have a relatively short elimination half life that normally would be administered in divided doses two or more times a day. Such medicinal agents include cardiovascular drugs such as propranolol hydrochloride, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide 5 mononitrate, pelrinone see U.S. Patent 4,505,910 , acifran see U.S. Patent 4,244,958 verapamil hydrochloride, quinidine sulfate, the cerebral activators such as vinpocetine, 6,7,8,9 tetrahydro 8,8,10 trimethyl 9 1 pyrrolidinyl pyrido 1,2 a indole Ay 30109 ,see U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 811,551, filed December 20, 1985 by Jirkovsky et al., entitled 6,7,8,9 Tetrahydro 10 methylpyrido 1,2 a indole 9 Amines and Derivatives Thereof the analgesics such as cis 1,8 diethyl 2,3,4,9 tetrahydro 4 2 propenyl 1H carbazole 1 acetic acid Ay 30068 disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 726,197, filed April 22, 1985, the antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine and bromopheniramine and the decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. In the case of medicinal agents having a significant pH dependent solubility profile, weak organic acids such as citric, tartaric, fumaric and glutamic acids may be added to the spheroid formulation to facilitate drug dissolution throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The present invention also lies in the general area of timed disintegration coatings and represents a substantial improvement over the prior art compositions in that the time of disintegration is readily controllable and easily adjusted for release of a medicinal substance. The present invention relates to a therapeutic composition comprising a pharmaceutical gelatin capsule containing i a powder blend of a medicinal substance and two groups of spheroids each containing the medicinal substance or ii three groups of spheroids each containing a medicinal substance, the alternative group of spheroids comprising uncoated spheroids containing a loading dose of the medicinal substance.
