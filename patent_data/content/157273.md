## Description
5. A PROGRAMMABLE TIME SWITCH DEVICE FOR OPERATING AT LEAST ONEACTUATING MEANS, SAID DEVICE BEING FULLY SEPARABLE FROM SAIDMEANS The present invention relates to a programmable time switch device which is able to regulate, time and operate at least one actuating means, for example electromechanical, said device being fully separable from said means.At present known timer devices of the electronic type have an electronic programming logic and or control circuit and may be operated by pressing multifunction pushbuttons. Said programming logic is electrically connected to an electromechanical or electronic actuating device, suitable for connecting and disconnecting a load for a preset interval of time. This latter part of the device is also called actuating part .At present all existing timer devices have incorporated into a single structure both the programming and or control logic or unit and the part intended as an actuator.As a result, with a single programming logic only one actuating or output device can be operated. In addition known electronic timers do not stand up very well to high temperatures. If, therefore, these timers are used in ovens, for example, malfunctions may occur in the electronic part.Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a device, wherein the programming and output units are fully separable, such that the programming part can also work independently and, for example, act as a normal timer which just outputs an acoustic or light signal at the end of each timing cycle, without connecting or disconnecting a load. Moreover, the actuating part, in turn, should be activated by any other device capable thereof.A further object is to provide a timer device with an electronic prograrming unit, suitable for use in equipment wherein very high temperatures, over 1000C, are also reached, without the electronic circuitry being damaged by said high temperature.The object is achieved by making provision for the programming part and the output part to be housed in two distinct casings, which can be connected electrically by means of a connector with at least two pins for both the programming part and the actuating part to be energized independently and for both of them to have at least one storage means, wherein are stored respectively the status which the actuating means must have according to the condition of the timer and the actual status of said actuating means. In addition, means are also provided for comparing the contents in the storage means, suitable for sending a signal to a processing means on the basis of the result of the comparison.One solution according to the invention, which is not binding, will now be illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows in perspective an exemplary embodiment of the device Fig. 2 is a side view of the device according to the invention Fig. 3 is a block diagram of the elements which make up the device comprising the programming part and the actuating part.It can be seen in the figures that the programming part or unit 10 is housed in a suitable container fitted with a display 20 and means 21 for setting cycles or programs, for example composed of pushbuttons. The fixed or actuating part 11 is, however, housed in the container comprising one of the loads.The connector 12 comprises a part 12a, fitted with pins 13, and the relative female part 12b. Herein several connecting pins 13 are shown, in case several loads are to be tripped on the basis of the coands sent from the processing circuit provided in the programing part 10. If only one load has to be connected or disconnected, then just two pins are sufficient.The which is shown in only a nonbinding example. Provision may be made, for instance, for using a knob to set the timing interval for connecting the load, said knob sending a signal to the processing unit, for example, by modifying a resistor.Referring to Fig. 3, the elements needed to realize the invention will now be illustrated.The prograsming part 10 comprises a processing unit 22 to which are connected the display 20, through an encoding and decoding circuit 20a, and the cycle setting means 21, through the relative encoding and decoding circuit 21a. To said processing unit are connected a timing means 26, a means 28 for storing the status of the timing means, whereto corresponds a status of the actuating means for the actuating part, a means 30 for comparing the status stored in the storage means 26 and that relative to the actuating part, a signaling means 32, for example acoustic, and part 12a of the connector. The whole unit is fed from a suitable independent battery power supply 24, housed in the container.The programming part 10, therefore, constitutes an independent timer unit, also as far as regards the power supply.Provision is made in the actuating part 11 for the storage means 40, connected to the actuating means 42, to be connected to part 12b of the connector. It is all fed independently from a battery power supply 44 or suitably transformed mains.The device is used as follows to set a timed connecting of the load, the programming part 10 and the actuating part 11 are connected by means of connector 12. The cycle setting means 21 is used to set the start and duration of timing. The processing means, therefore, provides for sending a tripping signal to the actuating part 11, activating the actuator. In addition, the status of the timer 26, in this case corresponding to the active status of the actuator, is stored in the storage means 28.The status of the actuating means tripping is, in turn, stored in the storage means 40.If the two parts are subsequently separated, the timer continues to work, the programming part being independently supplied with power.At the end of the timing or, in any case, when the end of the timing draws near, an acoustic and or visual signal is emitted from the signaling device 32 so as to warn the user that the control part must be connected to the actuating part. At the end of the timing the processing unit 22 provides for modifying the information stored in the storage means 28. Therefore, information will be present corresponding to a deactivated status of the actuator. Through the connection between the two parts, the processing unit operates a comparison, using means 30, of the information stored in means 28 and that stored in means 40. If, as in this case, the two sets of information are different, a signal is sent to modify the status of the actuator in this case to stop it working so as to make it the same as that in the storage means 28, which depends on the status of the timer. In fact, the status of storage means 28 prevails over that of means 40. This status remains stored until the programming part 10 is activated to carry out a new cycle manual connecting timed disconnecting of the load .If the programming part is disconnected and connected again to the actuating part while the timing is still in course, and the actuating part is in the activated condition, no status modification will occur, because the contents in the two storage means coincide. It is evident that the devices suitable for use as storage means may be of the bistable type which modify their own status, whenever an input signal arrives.The processing circuit may, of course, be set to simultaneously control more than one timing interval. In this way a first timing may be programmed for connecting and disconnecting an electrical load, while a second and simultaneous timing may be programmed to carry out a different activity, for example, studying.Similarly, if several loads are provided, their timed connecting and disconnecting may be actuated separately, that is, there may be several independent timings. In this case, a timing means, a code and a storage means are associated with each load. The processing means 22 provides for managing the signal coming from the program setting means and going to the storage means one for each load and the actuating part. In this case the storage means of part 10 and those of part 11 also comprise an identification code, which is always examined by the means of comparison.It is clear that such an arrangement with several timers and storage means in the programming part 10, suitably managed by the processing means, also allows the delayed connecting of at least one load to be programmed. The alterations for realizing such a function using the means described are within the competence of any technician in this field. Therefore, the programming unit 10 is clearly able to control separately more than one actuating device, where necessary with delayed connecting of the load, or to be used by itself as a simple timing clock, as it is also fully independent in terms of power supply.According to the invention, therefore, the electronic part may be kept separate from the equipment or heat source if the device is fitted in an oven which houses only the actuating part, allowing parallel programming of several operations and the use of electronic timers even in critical cases, that is, where the temperature is high. Lastly the use of only one timer for several equipments is made possible.
