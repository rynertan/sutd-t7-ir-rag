# Amine terminated polyalkylene oxide neutralized sulfonated thermoplastic polymers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to amine terminated polyalkylene oxide neutralised sulfonated thermoplastic polymers which have useful physical and rheological properties. The thermoplastic polymers can be for example poly styrene and the amine terminated polyalkylene oxide can be for example an ethoxylated lauryl amine.
