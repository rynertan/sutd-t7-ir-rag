# Digital signal reproducing circuit.

## Abstract
Digital signal reproducing circuit for correcting phase errors of digital signals, and for synchronizing a bit synchro nizing clock to the digital signal. The circuit comprises at least a PLL circuit 17, 18 connected to a wave shaping circuit 16 , a pattern detector 21, 22 connected to the PLL circuit 17, 18 for detecting the specified signal patterns of the digital signal, and a circuit 83 for detecting the phase errors of the inputted digital signals and correcting properly the digital signals after the specified signal pattern are detected by the pattern detector 21, 22 .
