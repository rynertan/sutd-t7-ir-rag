## Description
The present invention relates to a sense amplifier used, for example, in a static type semiconductor memory device, one of the functions of the sense amplifier being to select one of a plurality of input signals. In a static type RAM device, a very small voltage difference of, for example, about 0.5 V, output from a memory cell and transmitted to a pair of data buses is amplified by a sense amplifier when readout operation is effected. However, in a conventional static type RAM device, especially a large capacity RAM device, since a bit line pair, column transfer gates, and a data bus pair are connected to a selected memory cell, the load of the memory cell becomes heavy, and the readout speed is deteriorated. Especially, in a large capacity RAM device, each bit line and data bus become long and thin, and the on resistance of the column transfer gates becomes large. Therefore, if the drive ability of each memory cell is not large, it takes a long time for the input signal of the sense amplifier to reach a steady state signal level. Various solutions to this problem have been put forward. For instance the use of a sense latch to detect small differential signals on the memory bit lines has been proposed US 3 953 839 . One latch circuit is required for each pair of bit sense lines, plus a final latch providing a driver output. Another known solution JP A 56 29 889 proposes a MOS circuit for mutually inverting the potential of a readout bus line of a sense circuit corresponding to two respective sets of digit lines. This solution utilizes two sense amplifiers per memory cell, each amplifier receiving a mutually inverted digit line. Yet another solution IBM TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE BULLETIN, Vol. 24, N 11A, April 1982 pages 5654 5656 proposes a bit line sense amplifier, operating in current mode switching, for each word group. The sense amplifiers input stages are controlled by sensing transistors configured as a big current switch, with their buses connected to bit rails of the word group. It is an object of the present invention to decrease the load of each selected memory cell and to speed up the operation of a semiconductor memory device. According to the present invention, there is provided a sense amplifier of a differential amplifier type for receiving pairs of complementary input signals and generating an output signal corresponding to a selected pair of complementary input signals in accordance with received address signals applied thereto, having a pair of input circuit portions, one of said input circuit portions comprising a plurality of circuit units each generating the amplified output of one of a pair of complementary input signals in response to one of said address signals applied thereto, and the other input circuit portion comprising a plurality of circuit units each generating the amplified output of the other one of said pair of complementary input signals in response to said one of said address signals, each of said circuit units comprising a serial connection of a pair of MIS transistors, one of which receives a decoded address signal at a gate thereof, and the other one of which receives one of said complementary input signals at the gate thereof, each of said input circuit portions being constituted by a parallel connection of a plurality of said serial connections of MIS transistors load circuits each comprising a MIS transistor respectively connected in series between said parallel connections forming the respective input circuit portions and a power supply terminal characterized in that the sense amplifier further comprises a constant current circuit comprised of a MIS transistor connected between a common terminal and a terminal of a power source said MIS transistors that receive a decoded address signal have their sources connected to said common terminal one of said load circuits has a direct gate drain connection, and the gates of the load MIS transistors and the gate of the MIS transistor of said constant current circuit being commonly connected. Before describing the preferred embodiment, an explanation will be given of a static type RAM device using conventional sense amplifiers with reference to the drawings. Figure 1 illustrates a general static type RAM device in which one sense amplifier SA is provided for one memory chip, and memory cells therein are divided into a plurality of memory blocks M₁, M₂, . In the memory device of Fig. 1, data bus pairs DB and There is also known a memory device which comprises a sense amplifier for every data bus pair DB and In the cases mentioned above, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the loads of a selected memory cell MC are a bit line pair BL and As mentioned above, the device shown in Figs. 1 and 2 has the disadvantages of a heavy load for each memory cell and a low operation speed. According to the present invention, there is provided a sense amplifier which overcomes these problems, as described below. Figure 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a CMOS type sense amplifier as an embodiment of the present invention. The sense amplifier comprises a pair of complementary input terminals IN and Where the sense amplifier of Fig. 3 is adopted to the memory device of Fig. 1, it is used as a substitute for the circuit portion surrounded by dot dash line of Fig. 1. Therefore, the data buses DB and As apparent from Fig. 3, each set of the transistors Q When an output A Where the sense amplifier is provided for every data bus pair DB and Although the CMOS type circuit was explained above, the present invention can be also adopted to an N MOS type circuit and the like. As mentioned above, according to the present invention, since each sense amplifier itself has the function of selecting inputs, the load of each memory cell can be decreased when the sense amplifier is used as a column sense amplifier whose input terminals are connected to bit lines. When the sense amplifier is used as a sense amplifier whose input terminals are connected to data buses, it is possible to increase the readout speed because the transfer gates TG can be omitted. When the sense amplifiers are used in a two level hierarchical structure including a bit line stage and a data bus stage, it is possible to constitute a readout circuit stage having high response speed and simple connection patterns.
