# Surge arrester with a bypass gap.

## Abstract
A surge arrester includes two series connected non linear resistors 1, 2 composed mainly of zinc oxide. A linear resistor R1, R2 is connected in parallel to at least one of the non linear resistors 1, 2 , and a bypass gap 3 is connected in parallel to one non linear resistor 2 . With an AC voltage applied to the series connection, each linear resistor R1, R2 exhibits a resistance which is smaller than the equivalent resistance of the respective parallel non linear resistor 1, 2 .
