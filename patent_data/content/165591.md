# METHOD FOR DIRECT PLATE MAKING

## Abstract
A method for the direct production of printing plates in which exposure of an image on a photosensitive lithographic plate and plate processing are conducted in daylight. A printing plate 1 overlaid with a contact screen 6 which is secured to a screen frame is disposed on a rest 5 in an area where light is shielded by a light shielding cover sheet 7 . This area is evacuated so as to bring the plate into close contact with the contact screen 6 . A continuous tone image of an original bearing the continuous tone color image and a line image is exposed on the plate 1 . The vacuum state of the area is released with the light shielded state being maintained, and the screen frame with the contact screen 6 is drawn out of the range. The line image is exposed on the plate which is adhered to the rest by evacuating the light shielded area, and thereafter the plate is fed to a plate processing section and is processed there.
