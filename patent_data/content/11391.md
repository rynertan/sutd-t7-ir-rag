# Method of heat treating a material.

## Abstract
A method of heat treating a slurry material which has combustible and incombustible components includes burn ing the material in a fluidised bed, to devolatilise the water content and to produce a material which cannot be reslimed. Fine material elutriated from the bed is separated from the entraining gases and is recycled to the centre axis of the bed such that upon rising through the bed they encounter and are doused by the incoming spray of slurry material, the fine material so introduced is at a temperature lower than that of the fluidised bed and thus can be used to control the bed temperature by varying the amount of fine material recycled.
