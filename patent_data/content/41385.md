# Heat storage medium.

## Abstract
A heat storage medium contains a a sodium hydroxide in concentration from 60 by weight up to and including the stoichiometric concentration in sodium hydroxide monohy drate, b water in concentration from 40 by weight down to and including the said stoichiometric concentration, and c 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of tellurium dioxide, all percentages being expressed as percentages by weight of the total weight of sodium hydroxide and water. The tellurium dioxide reduces the tendency of the sodium hydroxide water system to supercool.
