# Process for obtaining corn oil from corn germs and corn oil thus obtained.

## Abstract
A process for obtaining high quality crude corn oil com prises A milling wet corn germs at a temperature not above 50 C and a pH between 3 and 4 to a particle size of less than 160 microns, B promptly subjecting the milled slurry at a solid content not greater than 17 to leaching forces to sepa rate a solid phase from a liquid phase, and C promptly separating and recovering the oil from the liquid phase. The resulting oil has improved purity compared to that obtained by conventional methods.
