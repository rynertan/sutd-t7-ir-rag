# Process for preparing polyarylates.

## Abstract
Described herein is an improved process for preparing a polyarylate having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.1 to greater than 1.0 dl gm which process comprises the follow ing steps a reacting an acid anhydride derived from an acid containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms with at least one dihydric phenol to form the corresponding diester and b reacting said diester with at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid at a temperature sufficient to form the polyarylate, wherein the improvement comprises carrying out said process in the presence of at least one thermoplastic polymer.
