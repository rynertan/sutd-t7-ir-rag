# DIRECTIONAL OPTICAL FILTER

## Abstract
A directional filter is constructed with a plurality of grooves 15 extending into a plate 13 from one side 16 thereof. The grooves 15 have a light absorbing characteristic which causes them to absorb light impinging upon the grooves, particularly light impinging upon the grooves 15 from within the plate 13 . Since all light passing beyond a certain angle must impinge upon the grooves 13 , and only a small percentage of light passing parallel to the cut of the grooves 15 would impinge upon the grooves 15 , the filter has a high ratio of attenuation of unwanted verses wanted light.
