# FLAME SPRAY METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of, and apparatus for, flame spraying particulate material utilizing the thermal energy of a very hot gaseous primary stream 27 produced in an oxy fuel combustion chamber 11 combined with kinetic energy from a surrounding annular sheath of warm high velocity secondary air 28 , the velocity of the said sheath of sec ondary air 28 being sufficiently close to the velocity of the primary stream 27 to avoid significant mixing between the two streams.
