# VALVE

## Abstract
A valve, particularly a butterfly valve, having an elas tomeric seat in which the axial compression on the seat can be varied in predetermined, stepwise fashion so as to result in a predetermined radial inward movement of the seat, the valve having provision for applying the axial compressive forces in a generally uniform manner around the periphery of the seat, the elastomeric seat having the capability of withstanding pressures in excess of 1000 psi.
