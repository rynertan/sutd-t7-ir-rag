## Description
This invention relates to a device for stripping an outer insulating sheath from an electrical cable to reveal an inner conducting core. Such a device will henceforth be referred to as a cable stripping device. US Patent No 2601797 discloses a cable stripping device comprising a pair of manually operable handles by means of which a pair of jaws and a pair of cutters are first pivoted to grip and cut through the insulating sheath, the cutters then being withdrawn rectilinearly from the jaws to remove the severed end of the sheath. Operation of the device is by means of a relatively complex series of linkages. Another construction of this general type in which movement of the cutters relative to the jaws is by means of a slidable mounting of one handle relative to the other is shown in US Patent No 3125908. In this case, however, the device is of even more complex construction. According to the present invention, there is provided a cable stripping device comprising first and second manually graspable handles which are capable of relative movement towards and away from one another, first and second jaws which move towards one another during a first, rotary part of relative movement of the handles towards each other to grip a cable placed in use between said jaws, the first jaw and the first handle together forming a first lever member, and the second jaw forming part of a second lever member which is pivotally connected at a stationary point to the first lever member, and a pair of cutter blades disposed adjacent the jaws and which are urged together by the movement of the first and second lever members during said first, rotary part of the handle movement thereby to cut through an outer insulating sheath of said cable, the cutter blades during a second, rectilinear part of said relative movement of the handles, moving away from the jaws to strip the outer sheath from the cable, Conveniently, the cutter blades are formed respectively on the ends of a resiliently deformable U shaped member which is disposed between the first and second lever members. It has been found particularly advantageous to the operation of the device if the direction of the second, rectilinear movement between the handles is parallel or substantially parallel to the longitudinal centre line of the member carrying the pair of cutter blades. Desirably, the device also includes a cable cutter which is operated by means of said handles. The cable cutter may comprise an anvil formed on the first lever member and a cutter blade mounted on the second handle or on the second lever member so as to be movable towards and away from the anvil. The anvil is preferably formed by a side wall of a laterally extending hole in the first lever member. Conveniently, the device also includes a cutter for separating the cables of a twin cable eg a lamp flex , which cutter is also operated by means of said handles. As with the above mentioned cable cutter, this cutter can comprise an anvil formed on the first lever member and a cutting blade mounted on the second handle or on the second lever member so as to be movable towards and away from the anvil. The anvil is preferably formed by a side wall of a bore in the first lever member. Most advantageously, the cutting blade of the cutter also constitutes the cutting blade of the cable cutter, and the bore and the hole in the first lever member intercommunicate. Desirably, movement of the cutter blades towards the jaws is limited by a stop between the second handle and the second lever member, and a spring urges the second handle towards the stop and thereby also urges the first and second levers apart. Preferably, the handles are disposed closely adjacent to one another so that they can be manually squeezed together, and one handle is recessed to receive the other handle during such squeezing movement. The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring first to Figure 1, the illustrated cable stripping device is composed generally of a pair of handles 10 and 11 which can be manually squeezed together against the action of a spring 12, the handle 10 being recessed to allow the handle 11 to be received therein during such squeezing movement. The handle 10 forms one limb of a first lever member 13 of generally L shaped configuration, the other limb 13 Disposed between the lever members 13 and 15 is a generally U shaped resilient member 23 having a pair of cutting blades 24 formed at its ends, respectively, these blades normally being positioned closely behind the jaw elements 14 and 17. A slot not visible in the drawings is provided in a central portion of the member 23 so that the latter can straddle an upper part of the handle 11 and pass around lugs 25 only one visible provided thereon. An upper limb of the member 23 bears against the underside of the extended projection 19 on the handle 11, while a lower limb of the member 23 bears against an upper surface of the limb 13 In order to strip the outer insulating sheath from an electrical cable, the cable,C Figure 3 , is placed between the jaw elements 14 and 17 and the handles 10,11 are then manually squeezed. Because of the geometry of the arrangement, during a first part of the squeezing movement the handle 11 and the lever member 15 remain locked together under the force of the spring 12 so that they pivot in unison relative to the lever member 13. This causes the jaw elements 14 and 17 to grip the cable and at the same time causes the cutting blades 24 to cut into the insulating sheath. Under this condition as depicted in Figure 2 , the lever member 15 can pivot no further and therefore effectively becomes solid with the lever member 13. Therefore, continued squeezing of the handles causes the handle 11 to slide rectilinearly relative to the lever member 15 against the action of the spring 12 see Figure 3 , thereby withdrawing the cutting blades 24 from the jaw elements 14, 17 and causing the blades to strip the insulating sheath from the cable. In the illustrated embodiment, it is found that upon release of the handles 10 and 11 the jaw elements 14 and 17 separate to release the cable before the cutting blades 24 have returned to their starting position, thereby avoiding damage to the cut end of the sheath by this return movement of the blades 24. This is thought to result from the frictional resistance to the sliding movement of the projection 19 along the recess 18 combined with the way in which the spring 12 applies a returning force to the various components. Thus, it is not necessary to provide a separate latch mechanism for preventing return of the cutting blades 24 until the jaw elements 14 and 17 have separated, which means that the present device can be made with fewer component parts and therefore at a lower cost. However, this is not to say that such a latch mechanism could not be provided as a safeguard measure, if desired. In the illustrated embodiment, the cable stripping device is provided with certain accessories to further assist the preparation of an electrical cable for connection to a plug, appliance or the like. A first of these accessories is a cable cutter and is formed by a cutting blade 26 mounted on the handle 11 and an anvil provided by the side wall of a through hole 27 formed in the limb 13 Although not specifically illustrated, a further accessory may be provided which enables the insulating sheath of a cable to be slit longitudinally, whereby the cut parts of the sheath may be parted to reveal the underlying conductor or conductors. This accessory is advantageously provided by means of a channel formed in the free end of the limb 13 It is preferred that the major components of the device i.e. the lever members 13, 15 and the handle 11 are moulded from a suitable plastics material, with the member 23 and the cutting blade 26 being made of metal and being secured to the plastics components by any convenient method, such as by riveting.
