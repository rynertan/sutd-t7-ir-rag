# Absorption detection system.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic detection system is described which, in operation, in a detection zone, by means of at least one transmission antenna coil, generates a swept frequency inter rogation field capable of being at least partly absorbed by a re sponder comprising a tuned circuit, if such responder is pres ent in the detection zone. Detection means are provided, cou pled with the transmission antenna coil to detect such absorp tion. According to the invention the detection means com prises means for eliminating spurious frequencies located out side the band of the swept frequency, said means comprising a mixer including a first input to which a signal from the trans mission antenna coil is supplied, and a second input to which the output signal from a sweeper feeding the transmission an tenna coil is supplied, and including an output connected with a low pass filter.
