## Description
Compositions This invention relates to dietary fibre containing tablets and a process for their preparation. Dietary fibre is that part of plant material which is resistant to digestion in the human gastro intestinal tract. H.C.Trowell Atherosclerosis 1972 16 138 40 . It is being realised increasingly that dietary fibre has an important role to play in many aspects of nutrition. One particular aspect is weight control. It was been established recently that weight loss by obese patients receiving a calorie controlled diet can be increased when part of the diet consists of a high bran food stuff. Bran is common source of dietary fibre. Bran based weight control products generally consist of a tablet of compressed raw bran. One particularly successful product is Bran Slim Bran Slim is a RegisteredTrade Mark . Products of this type suffer from the limitation that they can only contain restricted amounts of fibre because raw bran is relatively poorly compressable. We have now found that it is possible to formulate fibre containing tablets in such a way that they contain more fibre, than was possible with previously known formulations. Accordingly the present invention provides a chewable tablet comprising from 17 to 95 by weight of dietary fibre and a binding agent. Preferably the fibre is one that expands on ingestion. Preferably the fibre is water absorbent. In particular it is a partially dried fibre. Preferably cooked bran is present as the fibre. In particular the cooked bran is extruded cooked bran. In practice the tablet can contain from 40 to 95 of cooked bran.Generally the tablet contains at least 50 but not more than 80 of cooked bran. Especially palatable tablets are obtained when the amount of cooked bran is 70 or below. In particular the tablet can contain 57 by weight of cooked bran. Raw bran can be obtained from any grain hull e.g.wheat, corn, maize and oats. It will be appreciated that the cooking of bran is not an exact science but cooked bran can be recognised by the food technologist. Preferably the cooked bran in this invention is cooked wheat bran.The binding agent can by any such agent commonly employed in the food or pharmaceutical arts. Examples of these agents from pharmaceutical art are polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, starch paste and gelatin. Examples of food ingredients which can function as binding agents in the tablets of this invention are raisin and fructose.The term raisin used herein means raisin pulp or puree. Preferably the binding agent is raisin or fructose because besides acting as binding agents, they impart a pleasant flavour to the tablets. Raisin and fructose can be used separately or together. Preferably the tablet contains up to 35 by weight of raisin. In particular the tablet can contain 25 by weight of raisin. When raisin is present in small amounts e.g. for flavouring purposes only then in practice the minimum amount will be 10 . The tablet can contain up to 15 but preferably 10 by weight of fructose. When fructose is present in small amounts e.g. for flavouring purposes only in practice the minumum amount will be 0.5 . Brown sugar can also be present in an amount up to 5 by weight. In practice the minimum amount of brown sugar will be 0.5 . The tablets of this invention can be fortified with nutritional supplements for example vitamins in particularVitamins A, B1, B2, B6, and C , pro vitamins e.g. ss carateen , assimilable calcium and iron. The tablets can also contain a flavouring agent, a lubricant to assist tableting and a preservative for example calcium propionate. The tablet of the invention can be made in unit dose size or it can be made in a multi dose size which is marked in such a way as the consumer can cut or break off individual unit doses. A unit dose consists of a 4.5 g tablet containing 2.l g of cooked bran. One or two such tablets can be taken before meals. The tablets of this invention can be prepared by a process which comprises intimately mixing, in the required proportions, a binding agent and a dietary fibre so as to obtain a cohesive mixture and forming the mixture into a tablet. The step of intimately mixing the dietary fibre and binding agent is preferably carried out in a high shear mixer. The tablets can be formed by compression. This compression step can be carried out by conventional techniques and the material will be compressed at a pressure which gives satisfactory cohesion of the ingredients. Where cooked bran is present as the fibre, the tablets of this invention can be prepared by cooking raw bran and adjusting the moisture content, if required, to form a cohesive bran before mixing with the binding agent. Raw bran can be cooked in a number of ways for example by boiling in water or by extrusion cooking. The technique of extrusion cooking for bran is known from the cereal art and extrusion cooking in the process of this invention can be carried out in the same general way. The bran is cooked sufficiently to allow it to be formed into the tablets of the invention. The raw bran which typically contains 25 30 by weight of moisture is conveyed into an extrusion cooker with pre conditioning water. Typically bran can be conveyed into the cooker at from 400 to 635 kg min wet weight with pre conditioning water at from 1.75 to 2.1 kg mix 1 Typically the extrusion cooker has a 12 hole 0.6 cm diameter end die plate outlet nozzle having a cutting knife. The nozzle is maintained at a temperature of 140 1550C during the extrusion. The nozzle operates at an outlet pressure of 20 35 atmos. The bran pre conditioning water mix has a residence time of from 30 to 40 sec in the nozzle. Emergent extrudate can be sliced into small lengths approx 2.5 cm and conveyed to a continuous drying oven where it is dried to a moisture content of 10 or less and preferably substantially 4 to 6 by passing the material through the oven which is at a temperature of from 70 to 1150C preferably 1100C with a residue time of from 25 to 35 min. The dried cooked bran can be milled in a high shear cutter mixer, screened to a particle size range between 6 and 30 U.S standard mesh, blended with raisin and thereafter with brown sugar. Before forming this mixture into tablets, fructose, nutritional supplements, lubricant and preservative can be added. The following Examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLESExample 1 Raw wheat table bran 88,000 kg wet weight containing 28 moisture was passed at a rate of 600 kg min with pre conditioning water at a rate of 1.9 kg min through a 100 horse power screw feed extrusion cooker fitted with a 12 hole 0.6 cm diameter end die plate outlet nozzle having a knife. The nozzle was initially heated to 1400C with steam and maintained at a temperature in the range 140 1550C throughout the extrusion step. The outlet pressure of the extrusion nozzle was 25 atmos. The bran pre conditioning water mix has a residence time of approx. 33 sec in the nozzle.Emerging extrudate was chopped into approx. 2.5 cm lengths with the knife. The chopped extruded bran was conveyed by a belt through a continuous drying oven having a path length of approx. 13 m. The bran was dried to a water content of approx. 4 by passing the material through the oven at a temperature of 1000C so that it has a residence time in the oven of 28 min. The dried material was milled using a high shear cutter Berkel Inc Model VCM 40 vertical cutter mixer and screened to a particle size of 6 30 U.S. standard mesh. A portion of milled bran 60.0 kg was mixed with whole raisins 21.8 kg and the mixture blended in a high shear cutter mixer until a bran raisin homogenate was obtained the initial mix . The initial mix was mixed, maintaining the temperature in the range 70 900C, with brown sugar 18.2 kg in a high shear cutter mixer until a homogenate the second mix was obtained. The second mix was spread out on trays in an air conditioned atmosphere 35 45 relative humidity and allowed to cool until it reached ambient temperature. Any caking was broken up by passing the cooled second mix through aStokes Oscillating Granulator low shear sizing machine and sieving through a No. 8 U.S. standard mesh screen producing a granular product the base granulation . To a mixture of vitamin blend MJ1, 91.8 g , flavour, hazelnut H R 60580 15.0 g calcium proprionate 17.0 g fructose 89.9 g and lubritab 11.3 g was added an equal weight 225.0 g of base granulation. These ingredients were mixed together and more base granulation 4,050 g was added so that a total of 4,275.0 g base granulation was present. This mixture was then compressed into rectangular tablets 19.844 mm wide by 27.781 mm long by 6.35 mm thick each weighing 4.500 g 0.045 g.Example 2 To a mixture of vitamin blend MJ1, 91.8 g flavour vanilla H 38857 4.5 g calcium propionate 17.0 g , fructose 101.4 g and lubritab 11.3 g was added an equal weight 226.0 g of base granulation. These ingredients were mixed together and more base granulation 4,049.0 g was added until a total of 4,275.0 g of base granulation was present. This mixture was compressed in to rectangular tablets of a size and weight described inExample 1. Example 3 To a mixture of vitamin blend MJ1 91.8 g calcium propionate 17.0 g , fructose 104.9 g and lubritab 11.3 g was added an equal weight 225.0 g of base granulation. These ingredients were mixed and more base granulation 4,050.0 g was added until a total of 4,275.09 was present. This mixture was compressed into rectangular tablets of a size and weight described inExample 1. The flavours H R 38857 and H R 60580 are supplied byHaarman and Reimer Inc. New Jersey. Vitamin blend MJ1 contains dicalcium phosphate 49 parts by weight and ferrous sulphate 1 part by weight .Extrusion cooked bran according to these Examples contains 42 458 of dietary fibre.
