# An ohmic contact for an intermetallic compound semiconductor and a method of providing such a contact.

## Abstract
A metallic ohmic contact 1 is formed on the surface of an intermetallic compound semiconductor body 2 in which the net donor density of an amphoteric dopant is greater in a thin surface region extending into the body from the in terface 3 between the contact 1 and the body 2 than in the bulk of the body 2 . Preferably, the surface region has a net donor density greater than 5 10ยนโน atoms per cc and is 2 to 5 nm thick. The contact can be formed by growing a body of gallium arsenide in the presence of an arsenic over pressure and a source of germanium or silicon and then depositing a metal on the surface of the body.
