# Associative memory system.

## Abstract
An associative memory system for a relational data base comprises hardware circuits which permit a variety of opera tions to be carried out on data, including modification of data. The circuits include a first means 328 and a second means 320, 322, 324, 326 for simultaneously receiving a stream of data bytes from a storing means 310 , the second means carrying out selected operations on the data stream. The first means 328 includes a loop buffer for storing K bytes of the data stream and modified data received from the second means. The first means 328 also includes means for selec tively rewriting data back to its original location in the storing means at the same time as data is read from the storing means, whereby a write address is obtained by subtracting K from the current read address. The storing means is arranged as blocks of storage elements, preferably CCD arrays, arranged such that K bytes of data are obtained from a first block followed by K bytes of data from a second block. Prefer ably a plurality of associative data controllers are provided each data controller including a first means 328 and a second means 320, 322, 324, 326 . The storing means 310 is divided into a plurality of arrays of blocks of data, with each array being coupled to a respective data controller, thus enabling the data controllers to operate simultaneously on the arrays.
