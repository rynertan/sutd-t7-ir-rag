# Pressure regulator.

## Abstract
A pressure regulator for an anti lock braking system has a pressure modulating plunger 17 having different cross sections along its length to vary the available fluid volume within a chamber 13 situated in a brake line between a master cylinder and a wheel cylinder. The plunger 17 also incorporates a cam portion so that rotation of the plunger 17 causes the cam portion to operate a valve 14 allowing fluid to flow into the chamber. Closing of the valve 14 allows the plunger 17 to move in or out of the chamber 13 to modulate the brake pressure between the regulator and the wheel cylinder to counteract locking of the wheel and consequent skidding.
