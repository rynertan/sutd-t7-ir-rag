## Description
KIT FOR ANtI TERRORIST SHELTER KGO D AND FIELD OF THE INVENTION In recent years terrorist and criminal activities have increased and have been publicized widely throughout the world to the di√†dvantag of offering encouragement for further occurrence of such senseless activities. For whatever gain or cause, these activities very often have been directed at occupants of homes, corporate offices, diplomatic residences, military installations, nuclear facilities and the like and with set purpose to hold the occupants hostage for ransom or even worse to cause physical, fatal harm to the occupants.While awareness or alarm given occupants of a particular space that terrorist or criminal intrusion has or is about to pccur readily can be transmitted, it does not always result in their finding safe haven or effecting escape because of lack of time to effect sane. Further, secure shelter capable of withstanding determined attack, particularly by fanatic and dedicated terrorist groups is rarely available to those under attack. Terrorist groups frequently use armor piercing small arms ammunition, fragmentation grenades, chemicals and a wide variety of devices useable to break down doors, locks and similar structural impediments standing between them and the quarry sought. The present invention relates to a kit of structural components which can be packed in compact form, shipped to a site where a terrorist re. istant shelter is to be erected such as in a dwelling space, executive business or governmental office building, diplomatic office or like space, and then quickly erected into structure form with simplicity and without need for special tools and installation procudures. SU.M IARY OV THE PRESENT INVENTION An object cf the present invention is to provide a kit of structural components which can be field erected or assembled to form a terrorist resistant shelter for people under danger oF attack and violent harm at the hands of terrorist and criminal forces. Another object of the invention is the provision of a kit of structural components which when assembled provide a secure, safe shelter capable of withstanding the effects of armor piecing small arns fire, chemical attack, fragmentation grenade explosion, acetylene burning equipment, forced entry tools and attempts, and many of the other measures terrorists have employed in effort to gain access to persons sheltering from them. A further object is to provide a kit of structural components for erecting a terrorist resistant shelter which is relatively inexpensive, simple to erect and highly effective for the purpose in mind. Other objects will be made clear during the course of the desription of the invention to be given first briefly and then in detail below. In accordance with the present invention, the kit from which the shelter can be assembled includes a number of armor steel plate members provided in the form of generally flat, rectangularly plan outline components and in number such as to constitute an enclosure bottom, enclosure top, a pair of side wills and a rear wall.The armor steel used in the plate members and other enclosure forming components is bullet procf t a 30 06 ar nor piercirlK, round. 1 1e aforesaid plate members ar each provided at the margins thereof with connecting means adapted to align with like means of a right angularly adjacent dispose plate member and when aligned to be receptive of connector members for securely fastening said plate members together to form an open front enclosure, a principal purpose of the conneqto means connector members arrangement being that they are disposed wholly interiorly of the enclosure and inaccessible from the interior. In one embodiment the connector means comprises tubes on each plate member at its margins and arranged to align in paired relationship alongside a tube of an adjacent plate member so that a bolt connector member can be received in the paired tubes and a nut mounted on the bolt to secure the connection. In another embodiment the top and bottom plate members can be provided with skirts along three sides thereof and blind threaded passages formed in the skirt from the interior sides thereof.Openings formed in the upper and lower margins of the side walls and rear wall members can be aligned with the blind passages and screw fasteners passed through from the inside, through the openings and screw fastened in the blind passages. Again, the connection of the five plate members to form the open front enclosure is effected without any exteriorly accessible connection. The kit also incudes an armor steel front wall plate member adapted to be assembled to the open front enclosure in close off positioning and connection therewith, again there being any accessibility to such connection from the exterior of the enclosure. To provide ingress and egress 0 the shelter, the front wall plate member can in one form be provided as an encircling frame portion fixedly connected to the plate members adjacent thereto, i.e., the top, bottom and side wall, witn there being a door panel hinged to said frame portion. Alternatively, the entire front wall plate member can be hinged for movement between open and closed positions.In either case, suitable locking means, such as a hasp or magnetic lock is provided for locking the moving part in closed position ani further, all connections and locking means are disposed interiorly of the enclosure. To provide the occupants of the enclosure with surveilance observation oE the exterior environment, at least the front wall plate member is provided wit ballistic grade glass window, and to allow for th occupants to disrupt terrorist activity with counerfire, a gunport is also provided. Armor steel closure plates are associated with both the window and the gunport t 1 cover over these openings when necessary. The closure plates are operable solely from within the enclosure and that for the window disposed in front of the glass to provide security if it becomes necessary to replace a window glass damaged by hostile action. The kit also includes a battery adapted for disposition within the enclosure to provide power for operating the magnetic lock, and a source or tank of compressed aiL adapted for use within the enclosure to maintain positive pressure therein above that level of atmospheric pressure in the environment outside the enclosure. The positive pressure source serves to prevent infiltration of terrorist released gas from entering the enclosure and also prolongs the life sustaining environment within the enclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTON OF THE DRAWINGS A fuller understanding of the nature and object of the present invention will he had from the following detailed description taken in conjunctioll with the accompanying drawings showing by way of example preferred embodiments of the invention concept and in which FIGURE 1 is a plan showing one of embodiment of kit assembly components which can be used for erecting a terrorist resistant shelter. FIGURE 2 is a fragmenting perspective view on enlarged scale depicting one form of connector means and connector members employed for securely fastening the steel plate members together.

FIGURE 4 is a fragmentary exploded perspective view showing the manner of connecting plate members together using skirted bottom and top plates fitted with blind threaded passages receptive of screw fasteners. FIGURE 5 is a simple circuit diagram depicting the power supply for operating a magnetic door lock. Throughout the following description, like reference numerals are used to denote likeparts in the drawings. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The kit of the present invention can be provided with varying features depending on oarticular intended shelter construction. For example, the kit of Figures 1 and 2 is generally satisfactory for most dwelling place installations where the terrorist or criminal threat is considered moderate . The Figures 3 and 4 kit on the other hand is generally intended for use in high risk situations such as in executive offices, diplomatic buildings, nuclear facilities etc., where experience indicates that the more fanatic type of terrorist are likely to be involved. The components used can be adapted to erect shelters of various sizes.For example a shelter can have overall dimensions of about 56 x 42 x 30 in one embodiment, and dimensions of about 72 x 60 x 36 in another. In addition to features depicted in the drawings the kit can also include components for lighting, fire extinguishing features, plumbing access, communication connections, heating and cooling systems, disquise panels etc. Particular advantage is provided by the compact kit form facilitating shaping and delivery to the on site location where the shelter is to be erected. The shelter can be erected at any suitable location in a dwelling or office space and the site can be specially selected to allow the shelter to blend with other space construction so that with suitable disguise, its location may go undetected. Referring to the kit depicted in Figures 1 and 2 it includes as components a plurality of armor steel plate members, viz., a back plate 10, a top plate 12, a bottom plate 14, and t pair of side wall plates, 16,13, all such plates being seen to be of generally rectangular plan outline and the inner side surfaces thereof except top plate 12 facing the viewer. A front wall plate 20 of armor steel is also provided, the outside thereof being seen.The plates 10 20 are adapted to be positioned one in adjacent right angular relationship with others and connected together to form a generally rectangular shaped enclosure. All of the plate members are provided along the margins hereof and at their inner surfaces with one or more tubular sleeves 22, welded as at 23 to the plate members. The positioning of the sleeves 22 is such that each sleeve on a plate member and when such plate member is disposed at a right angle to others in enclosure defining relation therewith, aligns with a sleeve on another plate member in paired relationship therewith as seen in Figure 2.It also will he noted that the positioning oE the sleeves on plates 12,14,16 and 18 is such that the top and bottom plates 12,14 are interchangeable as are the side wall plate 16,18 a feature materially reducing the fabrication costs of thcse particular components. The manner in which the respective plate members are fastened together is shown in Figure 2. Thus and for example, sleeve 22a of bottom plate 14 aligns in paired relationship with sleeve 22b of left side wall plate 16.Connector bolt 24 is received through the bores of the aligned sleeves and a nut mounted on the bolt to secure the fastening. It will be seen that the fastening moans is thus diposed wholly interiorly of the erected enclosure and not accessible from the outside. When the bottom plate 14, zack plate 10, top plate 12 and side wall plate3 16,18 hdve ben connected together, they form an open Front enclosure. To close off the open front, the front wall plate 20 is erected and fastened to the walls 16,18 and the bottom 14 and top 12. In the depicted embodiment thereof this is done with sleeves and nuts and bolts.Front wall plate 20 is also adapted to allow for ingress and egress to the enclosure and for which purpose, the said front wall plate 20 includes and encircling frame portion 24 of generally uniform width which demrks the ingress egress opening size and which opening is closed off by a front wall door panel 26, the panel being hinged as at 28 to the door frame at the interior side. A door stop 30 is also provided around the perimeter of the door, the stop being fixed to the frame portion 24. To securely lock the door panel is closed position, a hasp or slide lock 32 is provided on the inside of the door panel and frame portion. When the shelter is not in use and particularly when used in a dwelling placc, an exterior mounted hasp can be provided for such purpose. It will be understood that the shelter thus erected from the kit components has been effected with connections of the components which are all interior of the shelter and a terrorist or criminal has no accessibility to them in effort to disassemble the structure. In the Figures 1 and 2 kit embodiment, it will also be noted that no wall of the enclosure has any expanse beyond the planes of walls adjacent thereto further inhibiting attack on the structural integrity of the shelter. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate another emodiment of kit components which are adapted to be assembled o erect the high risk shelter of Figure 3. The components include plate members of armor steel and constituting a base or bottom 40, left side wall 42, right side wall 44, top 46, rear wall 48 and a front side wall or door member 50 hinged along one long margin thereof to the right side wall 44 with a hinge means 52 disposed fully interiorly of the shelter. Figure 4 shows the manner of fastening together components 40 48. Bottom plate component 40 and top plate component 46 are provided as interchangeable members and each has a skirt extending along the two side wall and rear wall associated portions thereof so that the respective upper and lower margins of these three wall plate components can be received inboard of the skirts.The skirts are each provided with blind threaded passages 54 at the skirt inner sides and the wall plates in turn with three openings 56. When received in the top and bottom components, the wall plate openings 56 align with passages 54. Screw fasteners 58 can then be passed through openings 56 and into threaded connection with the skirt passages to thereby fasten these components together with connections that are wholly interior of the enclosure. A seat plate 60 can be mounted on supports 62. The front plate or door member is provided with a ballistic grade glass window 64 to permit viewing of the space exterior of the shelter, the glass being of armor piercinq hullet proof character. If repeated attack on the window should render it non transparent, the glass can be replaced from within the shelter. In furtherance of that purpose and to allow for maximum safety of the shelter, an armor plate slide closure member 66 intervenes the exterior of the erclosllre and the window, and can be slid to a position covering over the window opening. The door member can also be provided with a gunport 68 to permit a shelter occupant to deliver terrorist suppressing gunfire from the shelter, access to the gunport being achieved by sliding protective armor plate 70 to one side. To lock door 50 in closed Dosition, a mechanical lock of various kinds can be provided. For example door 50 and left side wall 42 can be provided with sleeves 22 which align when the door is closed and a bolt or pin can then be dropped into the aligned sleeves. A magnetic lock unit 72 also could be used, the lock being positioned such as to be contacted by a striker plate 74 on the inside of the ddor member, the lock holding the door closed magnetically.Figure 5 shows the sample circuit utilized to power the lock unit 72 from a battery and control unit 76 provided as a kit component. Control of the magnetic lock for deenergizing same as for example when one wants to enter the shelter can be effected with a digital control unit not shown of known construction and function, the control unit being efi .ective to deenergize the look for say 5 seconds. A source of pressurized air 80 also can be included in the kit to allow occupants of the shelter to pressurize the interior to a level above the exterior environment atmospheric pressure and therby prevent incursion to the shelter of any harmful gaseous substance a terrorist may release in the vicinity of the shelter. The interior surface of ne plate members and door may be covered with an acoustical material 82 only a portion shown to deaden noise efftct within the shelter. While there is above disclosed but several embodiments of the kit of the present invention, it is possible to produce still other embodiments without departing from the scope of the inventive concept herein disclosed. For example, armor steel only need not be employed for the components. All or part of such components ccould be fabricated from other materials such as special aluminum alloys and other exotic materials exhibiting the necessary armor existance character. Accordingly, it should be understood that all matter contained in the above description and the accompanying drawings should be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
