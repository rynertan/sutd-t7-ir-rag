The present inventor has previously presentedin U. S. Patent Application Serial No. 651,362 a processfor producing spherical particles a cured epoxy resinhaving an average particle size of not larger than 50 µmand having a cationic group, which comprises adding anamine curing agent to a previously prepared emulsion orsuspension of an uncured epoxy compound. Japanese Patent Publication No. 53 42360discloses a process for producing spherical particles ofa cured epoxy resin having an average particle size ofseveral hundred µm and having a cationic group whichcomprises dispersing a mixture of an epoxy compoundhaving at least two epoxy groups and an amine curingagent in water. Japanese Patent Application However, none of these inventions teach orsuggest such particles and process for the production asthose disclosed in the present invention, that is,modified spherical particles having adsorbed thereon fineparticles having an anionic group or negatively chargeablefine particles, and a process for their production. An object of this invention is to providemodified organic spherical particles composed of organicspherical particles having an amino group and having anaverage particle size of 0.1 1000 µm, which particleshave adsorbed on the surface metal particles orlatex particles. A still further object of this invention is toprovide a process for the production of organic sphericalfine particles which comprises emulsifying or suspendinga monomer or oligomer,thereafter curing the particles with a curing agent toform a particulate polymer and subjecting them to a wetprocess thereby adsorbing on the surface of saidparticles one or more selected from fine metal or latex particles. A still further object of this invention is toprovide particles which may be employed as formulationingredients for cosmetics, paints, electrostatic copiertoners, conductive adhesives etc., and a process for theirproduction. According to the present invention surface modifiedorganic spherical particles are provided which areobtainable by a emulsifying or suspending a polyepoxidecompound in an aqueous liquid, adding to this uncuredepoxy suspension or emulsion a watersoluble amine curing agent, allowing this emulsion to curein spherical particles having an average particles size Dof 0.1 1000 micrometer and thereafter b making saidparticles adsorb on the surface metal or latex fineparticles having an average particle size d whichsatisfies the relationship 5d D, using a wet process. The organic spherical particles having acationic group and having an average particle size of0.1 1000 µm which constitute the present invention maybe generally produced from an epoxy compound cured withan amine curing agent or from an acrylic polymer containingan amino group. The epoxy spherical particles having an averageparticle size of 0.1 1000 µm may be generally producedas follows. There is a processwhich comprises emulsifying or suspending an uncuredepoxy resin in an aqueous liquid and thereafter curing it The epoxy compound used in this invention ispreferably that containing two or more epoxy groups.Examples thereof include both terminal glycidyletherified products of a Bisphenol A type compound,polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ethers, polyglycidylethers of phenol novolak type compounds, N,N,N ,N tetraglycidyl m xylenediamineetc. which may be usedeither alone or in mixture. Further, it is possible to add a small amount of a compound having one epoxy groupin the molecule, e.g. glycidyl methacrylate etc. asneeded. Further, a modified epoxy compound in which apart of the epoxy groups are combined with a compoundhaving an amino group etc. may be used in this invention. In the process, particles of an epoxycompound emulsified or suspended in an aqueous liquid arecured with an amine curing agent.The curing methodcomprises adding a water soluble amine curing agent to anaqueous emulsion or suspension of an epoxy resin andcuring. The method which comprises adding a water solubleamine curing agent to an aqueous emulsion orsuspension of an epoxy compound the latter method mayfurther be classified as follows Any of the above described methods may beemployed to achieve the present invention, and there isno particular restriction, but those according to theaforesaid A , B and C are particularly preferred inview of the uniformity in shape of the particles and theuniformity of the particle size distribution. Examples of the amine curing agent used in thesecond process generally include but are not restrictedto the following compounds piperazine, hydrazine,polyethylenepolyamines such as ethylenediamine,diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine etc., alcoholaminessuch as monoethanolamine etc., N 2 aminoethyl piperazineetc. In the second process, an aqueous emulsion orsuspension of an epoxy compound is prepared, and examplesof the method therefor are described below Of the above described methods, while themethods 3 5 are preferably used in the presentinvention in view of the productivity, combinations ofthe methods 1 5 may also be preferably used in thepresent invention. The surface active agent is not particularlyrestricted in the above described methods A and B forobtaining epoxy type spherical particles, and any ofthose generally known as emulsifiers for uncured epoxyresins, such as polyoxyethylene phenol substituted ethersetc. may safely be used. As the surface active agent foruse in the above method C , that having an HLB value of12 or more is used in an amount of 10 by weight or morebased on the epoxy compound. Where the HLB value doesnot satisfy this range, there is a tendency that curinginto a spherical form is not attained even when theabove described specific amine curing agent is used. In general, examples of the surface activeagent preferably used in the second process include ethertype nonionic surface active agents such as polyoxyethylenephenol substituted ether types, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropyleneblock polyether types etc., ester typenonionic surface active agents such as higher fatty acidesters of polyethylene glycol, aliphatic acid esters ofpolyols etc., and the like. Where a powdered emulsifier such as crystallinecellulose, barium sulfate etc. is used, it is a methodsuitable for producing relatively large particles of anaverage particle size of 10 1000 µm. It is also possible in the present invention toeffect the emulsification by using a substance exhibitinga protective colloidal effect such as polyvinyl alcohol,hydroxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate etc. Where the epoxy compound is emulsified orsuspended by using a surface active agent, a powderedemulsifier or a protective colloid substance, it isgeneral to adopt a method which comprises using an epoxycompound and water, either of which contains one of theabove agents, and gradually adding water to the epoxycompound stirred at a high speed. The formed emulsion orsuspension usually has a concentration of 10 80 byweight. For adding an amine curing agent to an emulsionor suspension of an epoxy compound, it is general to addthe curing agent either directly or as an aqueous solution.Although the curing agent can be a mixed system withanother amine curing agent or with a curing agent of adifferent type, it preferably satisfies the particularuse conditions for the above described particular curingagent. In the process, where the epoxy compound is firstly made into anaqueous emulsion or suspension and the curing agent isadded, then after the addition of the curing agent, acuring reaction is allowed to take place while themixture is allowed to stand or under mild stirringconditions. If it is desired to obtain a satisfactorycured state, there is a method of warming the entiresystem. The organic spherical particles having acationic group used in the present invention may beprepared by the above described processes, and those usedin the present invention are particles having an averageparticle size of 0.1 1000 µm, preferably 0.5 500 pm.If the average particle size is less than 0.1 pm, thecollecting of the particles is difficult, whereas if itexceeds 1000 µm, they are unsuitable for use asformulation ingredients for cosmetics, paints etc. forreasons of extraneous feeling, sedimentation etc. Examples of the solid fine articles used inthis invention include metal fine powders and colloidalparticles of copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium,nickel, chromium etc. are particularly contemplated. Examples of the latex type used in the presentinvention include acrylonitrile butadiene type latexes,acrylate latexes, styrene butadiene type latexes, vinylchloride type latexes, vinyl acetate ethylene typelatexes, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate ethylene typelatexes, acryl vinyl acetate ethylene type latexes,isoprene type latexes, vinylidene chloride type latexes,fluorine polymer type latexes, silicone emulsions etc.,and they may be used either singly or in mixture. In the present invention, the average particlesize D of the organic spherical particles and the averageparticle size d of the fine particles to be adsorbedpreferably satisfy the following relationship As the average particle size d of the fineparticles to be adsorbed becomes greater relative to theaverage particle size D of the organic spherical particles,the fine particles on the organic spherical particlestend to fall off. For this purpose, the relationship ismore preferably in the range 20d D. In order to make the organic spherical particlesadsorb the above described fine particles, the followingmethods are suitable. The latex has a tendency to change in thecovered conditions depending on its glass transitiontemperature Tg , and where Tg is in the vicinity ofnormal temperature or below, it covers the surface of the organic spherical particles as a uniform coat,whereas if Tg is higher than the adsorption treatmenttemperature, it is present as small grains on thesurface of the organic spherical particles. Therefore,by selecting the intermediate Tg, it is possible tofreely control the covered conditions from the coat tothe grains. Further, of the latexes having a low Tg,there are those capable of forming a crosslinking bondby heat or by addition of a crosslinking agent, and byselecting one of such latexes, it is possible to make auniform coat on the surface of the organic sphericalparticles, and thereafter form a crosslinking bond bye.g. heating etc., thereby enhancing the thermal ormechanical properties of the coat. On adsorption treatment, the organic sphericalparticles are preferably previously prepared as a slurryin water or an inert organic solvent. In order to makethe fine particles adsorbed on and cover the surface ofthe organic spherical particles, a method of adsorptiontreatment in a slurry form is preferred. Although it ispossible to make the fine particles in a dried formadsorbed on the organic spherical particles in a driedform, there is in general a tendency that the coveredconditions are not uniform, and also mass treatment isdifficult. However, where adsorption treatment is conducted in a wet mode as in the present invention, notonly mass treatment and simple operations but also it iseasy to uniformly cover the surface of each of the organicspherical particles. The fine particles to be adsorbed are preferablypreliminarily dispersed and made into a slurry in a mannersimilar to that for the organic spherical particles. Forpreliminary dispersing, a method using dispersant such asa surface active agent may be conducted. As an exampleof the method, a liquid nonionic surface active agent isadded to the fine particles to be adsorbed, kneadedsufficiently, then diluted with water if needed, and thusdispersed uniformly. Stirring of a mixture of both components foradsorption covering of the fine particles on the organicspherical particles can be achieved even by such smallstrength as that imparted by a magnet rotating blade, apropeller blade etc. equipped in a beaker, or it is alsopossible to use a high speed stirrer rotating at 10000rpm or more such as a homogenizer, a ball mill, or ashaker etc. Further, adsorption covering may be achievedby a method in which a sealed container holding glassbeads is subjected to shaking. Further, stirringtreatment may also be achieved using a motar. By usingthese devices, it is also possible to conduct preliminary dispersing or make a slurry of the organic sphericalparticles or the fine particles to be adsorbed. The amount of the fine particles to be adsorbedwhich is used in single treatment in the present inventionis in general 200 by weight or less, preferably 100 byweight or less, based on the organic spherical particles.If the amount of the fine particles to be adsorbedincreases beyond this, there is observed a tendency thatthe organic spherical particles agglomerate with eachother during adsorption treatment or the fine particlesfall off, and therefore uniform covering is impossible. By the present invention, it has now been madepossible to present surface modified particles obtainedby freely covering fine particles or latex polymers onthe surface of the organic spherical particles withoutbeing subject to the restriction by electrostaticproperties as with the dry mode. The effects achieved by the present inventionare as follows As described above, the present invention hasenabled to impart various desired properties to organicspherical particles and to present particles suitable asformulation ingredients for electrostatic copier toners,as well as for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, paints,adhesives, coating agents, inks, paper, films, plasticmolded products etc. Ten grams of a commercially available BisphenolA diglycidyl ether type epoxy resin Epikote 828,produced by Yuka Shell Epoxy Co. was placed in a 100 ccpolyethylene cup, 0.8 g of a commercially availablepolyoxyethylene phenol substituted ether type surface activeagent having an HLB value of 13 Noigen EA 137,produced by Dai ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co. was added thereto, and kneaded using a stirring rod fitted with a Teflonplate formed blade on the tip at 800 rpm for one minute.Thereafter, 6 cc of water put in a syringe was added in1.5 cc portions at one minute intervals with stirring at800 rpm. A milky white emulsion was formed in thepolyethylene cup. To this uncured epoxy emulsion was added acuring solution containing 0.6 equivalent of piperazinedissolved in 8 cc of water and homogenized by mildstirring. This liquid mixture was allowed to stand at25 C for 5 days to cure into spherical particles havingan average particle size of about 6 µm. Spherical particles having an average particlesize of about 6 µm as abovewere separated by suction filtration using filter paper,washed, and redispersed in water to obtain a dispersioncontaining 10 by weight of the particles. To this dispersion of the spherical particleswas added a styrene butadiene type latex, Nipole LX 410 average particle size 0.2 µm, Nippon Geon in an amountof 50 by weight on the solid basis based on the sphericalparticles and a small amount of phosphoric acid were added thereto and stirring was effected at 95 C for 5hours. The whole amount of the latex had been adsorbed onthe spherical particles, and observation of the particlesafter filtration and drying by a scanning electronmicroscopy revealed that the latex had covered in a coatform the entire surface of the spherical particles. To 40g of Epikote 828 in a 300 cc polyethylenecup were added 4g of Niogen EA 137. Proceeding as inExample 1, 24 cc of water was then added in foursuccessive portions to prepare an uncured epoxy emulsion.1.5 eq of hydrazine hydrate in 30g water was then added,and the resultant mixture allowed to cure by standing at25 C for 10 days to obtain spherical particles of averageparticle size 1.5 µm. The particles were filtered,washed, redispersed in 400g of water, divided into fourportions, and each portion treated as set forth in Table2. The treated particles obtained in Example 6 werefiltered, then dried, and observed by a scanning electronmicroscopy to find that the fine particles of vinylidenechloride had covered the surface of the sphericalparticles.
