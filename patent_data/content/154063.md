## Description
MODIFIED SILICALITE CATALYSTS AND THEIR PREPARATION AND PROCESS FOR THE USE THEREOF The present invention is directed toward modified silicalite catalysts and the use thereof for the production of fuel grade liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas. The catalysts and process disclosed are particularly suited for the production of isoparaffins, internal olefins and aromatics. A method for the.synthesis of the catalyst is also provided. Silicalite has the same structure as the alumina containing zeolite ZSM 5. The acid form of ZSM 5 is often used to convert low molecular weight alcohols or olefins to gasoline. ZSM 5 can also be used in a combination catalyst with a Fischer Tropsch component, to give high quantities of isoparaffins and aromatics. However, silicalite does not have the acidity of ZSM 5 and its ability to reform Fischer Tropsch products to isoparaffins and aromatics is greatly reduced. The conversion of synthesis gas via Fischer Tropsch catalysts is a well known process. Such catalysts generally produce liquid products which include components such as organic acids, aldehydes, alcohols and olefins which are undesirable for use as fuels. It is also known to employ zeolite catalysts for the conversion of various organic compounds. For example, U.S. Pats. No. 4,276,438 and 4,278,827 disclose processes for the conversion of aromatic compounds to dialkylbenzene compounds. Each process requires a particular type of zeolite catalyst which has been modified with either a Group IB or a Group IVB metal. U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,501 discloses a process for ,,the production of aromatics from hydrocarbons and air over a zeolite catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 3,271,418 discloses a process for cracking petroleum gas oil to produce high octane gasoline over a zeolite catalyst where the original alkali metal has been replaced by other cations. Others have disclosed the use of Fischer Tropsch catalysts with zeolites in organic synthesis. U.S. Pat.No. 4,279,830, for instance, discloses a two reactor process for converting synthesis gas to oxygenates and hydrocarbons by reducing CO in the first reactor over aFischer Tropsch catalyst, where a zeolite is optionally present, followed by treatment in the second reactor over a zeolite catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,783 discloses a process for the conversion of synthesis gases to hydrocarbon mixtures such as olefinic naphtha with an aromatic content of less than 20 weight percent.. The olefin plus aromatic content of such products comprises at least 50 weight percent. The zeolite component of the catalyst combination comprises not more than 0.5 weight percent alkali metal. Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,262 discloses a method for the conversion of synthesis gas to hydrocarbon mixtures rich in aromatics. A heterogeneous catalyst comprising zeolites and Fischer Tropsch synthesis catalysts is employed. Thus, while the art provides catalysts and processes for the conversion of synthesis gases and other organic feedstocks to various hydrocarbons over mixtures of zeolite and Fischer Tropsch catalysts, it has not disclosed the preparation and use of a modified silicalite, FischerTropsch combination catalyst and the use thereof to produce liquid hydrocarbons. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing gasoline quality liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel catalyst for converting synthesis gas to gasoline quality liquid hydrocarbons. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for the preparation of a combination catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas to liquid hydrocarbons. These and other objects, together with the advantages thereof over the prior art, which shall become apparent from the specification which follows, are accomplished by our invention as hereinafter described and claimed. The catalyst of the present invention comprises a silica molecular sieve modified by a metal which forms acidic oxides selected from the group consisting of GroupVIB and VIIB elements and, a Fischer Tropsch catalyst wherein the ratio of zeolite to Fischer Tropsch component is from about 0.1 to 10 1. The process of the present invention produces gasoline quality liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas and includes the step of contacting synthesis gas having a ratio of hydrogen to carbon oxides of from about 0.1 to 10.0 1 over a combination catalyst at a reaction temperature of from about 1000 C to 500 C and at a pressure of from about one atmosphere 0.1 MPa to about 200 atmospheres 20 MPa and at a gas hourly space velocity of from about 10 to 100,000. The combination catalyst itself comprises a silica molecular sieve modified by a metal of a GroupVIB or VIIB element and, a Fischer Tropsch catalyst wherein the ratio of zeolite to Fischer Tropsch component is from about 0.1 to 10 1. A method is also provided for the preparation of a combination catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas to gasoline quality liquid hydrocarbons. It includes the steps of modifying a silica molecular sieve with a metal which forms acidic oxides selected from the group consisting of Group VIB and VIIB elements and combining the modified zeolite with a Fischer Tropsch catalyst in a ratio of from about 0.1 to 10 1. The method can include as further steps impregnating the silica molecular sieve with a solution of the metal, evaporating the solvent, calcining the modified silica molecular sieve at temperature ranging from about 2000 to 8000 C for about one to 24 hours and reducing the combination catalyst with H2 and or CO at a temperature of from about 1000 C to 6000 C, at H2 and or CO partial pressures ranging from 0.001 MPa to about 5.07 MPa and for a period of time of from about one to 100 hours prior to employing the catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas. PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The catalyst of the present invention comprises a mixture or combination of a Fischer Tropsch catalyst and a silica molecular sieve, particularly silicalite, which has been modified with a metal which forms acidic oxides selected from Groups VIB and VIIB of the Periodic Table. Silicalite is described in U.S. Pat. No.4,061,724 and is a nearly aluminum free zeolite of theZSM 5 structure, the latter being a well known medium port zeolite. The silica to aluminum molar ratio in these silica molecular sieves is on the order of more than 500 1Si Al SiO2 Al20321000 1 . Silicalite II is also suitable, it being the silica analog of zeolite ZSM ll, also a medium port zeolite. Silicalite II has been described by Bibby, Milestone, Aldridge, Nature, 280, 664 1979 . Other silica polymorphs or dealuminated zeolites are also suitable as is F silicalite, the fluorinecontaining species described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,073,865. The subject matter of the publication and two patents is incorporated herein by reference. The silicalites are modified by impregnation with solutions, preferably aqueous or organic solutions, ofGroup VIB or VIIB metal salts, preferably Group VIB and particularly chromium. The metal introduced into the silicalite can range from about 0.01 to about 20 weight percent and is preferably between about 0.1 to 10 weight percent. The silicate is precalcined at temperatures ranging between about 100 C to 8000 C for at least one hour to remove volatiles before being impregnated with the metal salt solution. The solvent is subsequently evaporated to produce the impregnated, or modified, solid silicalite by a conventional method such as roto evaporation. The metal impregnated solid is then dried to remove trapped solvents and then calcined at temperatures between 3000 and 8000 C and preferably from 4000 to 7000 C. Calcining times range from about one to 24 hours. The calcined metal containing silicalite is then combined with a supported or unsupportedFischer Tropsch catalyst, which includes any such catalyst known in the art, either as an intimate mixture or as separate particles. The Fischer Tropsch catalysts include all of those generally known in the art. The catalysts employed in the examples were prepared according to the methods outlined in The Fischer Tropsch and RelatedSyntheses by H. H. Storch, N. Golumbic and R. B.Anderson, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1951 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The ratio of modified sieve to Fischer Tropsch component may be from about 0.1 to 10 and preferably between about 0.5 to 5 1 by weight. The mixture of FischerTropsch component and modified sieve can be intimate or present as separate particles in the reactor. When the two components are combined as an intimate mixture, the powders of the components greater than 30 mesh are combined and thoroughly mixed in the desired ratio and a lubricant such as graphite can be added to the mix. One to two weight percent based upon the total catalyst weight is sufficient.The mixture is then pressed into pellets or wetted and extruded, followed by drying and calcination. Pelleted catalysts are broken into 10 30 mesh particles before placement into the reactor. The catalyst is finally placed in the reactor and the Fischer Tropsch component activated in a known manner such as by reduction with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or a combination with cr without the presence of a diluent such as nitrogen. Reduction conditions are chosen to optimize the activity of the particular Fischer Tropsch component present in the catalyst. They normally include heating to a temperature of at least 1000 C up to about 6000 C at H2 and or CO partial pressures ranging from 0.001 MPa to about 5.07 MPa and for a period of time of from about one to 100 hours. In the process of the present invention, synthesis gas, i.e., a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in a ratio of 0.1 to 10 1 H2 CO and preferably between 0.25 to 2 1 H2 CO, is reacted in the presence of the novel catalyst in the vapor phase. The conversion can be conducted in either fluid bed or fixed bed reactors, the latter being exemplified herein, and the process is applicable to continuous or batch type operation. The reaction temperature should be maintained between temperatures from about 1000 to 500 C, preferably from about 1500 to 3500 C. Pressures may be from ambient to about 200 atmospheres 20 MPa , preferably from ambient to about 30 atmospheres 3 MPa . Synthesis gas space velocities can range from about ten to 100,000 GHSV, or volumes of gas passed over one equivalent volume of catalyst per hour, and preferably from about 100 to 10,000 GHSV. The use of a catalyst containing Cr Silicalite about 3 percent Cr with an Fe based Fischer Tropsch catalyst results in a liquid organic product containing large amounts of isoparaffins and aromatics. This result is much superior to the reforming ability of silicalite in an unpromoted state and is also better in producing aromatics than a combination catalyst containing HZSM 5 SiOz Al203X70 In the examples reported hereinbelow, a catalyst of the present invention was prepared in a two step process as follows Step I 10.8 gms of Cr NO3 3 6H20 was dissolved in 300 ml of 2 1 water acetone. To this solution 50 gm of silicalite which had been precalcined for 3 hours at 5000 C and 1 hour at 6000 C was added. The mixture was placed on a roto evaporation unit and the acetone slowly removed over a period of 20 minutes.The system was heated over a water bath and the water solvent was removed over the next 90 minutes. The moist solid was dried overnight about 17 hours at 1500 C, and then calcined for 4 hours at 6000 C to decompose the Cr nitrate. The expected Cr content of the catalyst was approximately 3.0 percent. The modified silicalite was designated Cr Silicalite. Step II Equal weights of a conventional Fischer Tropsch catalyst, 75Fe II 25Fe III 20Cu II and Cr Silicalite were mixed with 2 percent graphite and thoroughly mixed on a roll mill. The powder was then pressed into pellets.The pellets were broken up and screened to give a 10 30 mesh fraction which was isolated and calcined. The catalyst formed is one of the present invention and is designated asCatalyst A. Catalyst A was reduced and then run in a fixed bed reactor for the conversion of synthesis gas as follows 20 cc of Catalyst A was reduced at ambient pressure at a temperature of 250 C under a flow of 50 SCCM standard cubic centimeters Hz, 50 SCCM CO and 900 SCCM N2 overnight. The pressure was increased to 1.04 MPa and flows of 50 SCCM H2 and 50 SCCM CO were introduced. The bath temperature was increased to 2700 C and a 1159 minute run was conducted. A gas contraction of 10.7 percent was observed.The Cs liquid yield was 0.06 gms per hour. For purposes of comparison, two catalysts not part of the present invention, designated as B and C, were also prepared by substituting zeolite and unmodified silicalite for the Cr Silicalite component of the invention. Preparation was as follows Catalyst B The procedure of Step II was employed with the acid form of a medium port zeolite, HZSM 5 SiO2 Al203N70 1 substituted for the Cr Silicalite of Step I. Catalyst C The procedure of Step II was employed with silicalite SiO2 Al203 1000 substituted for the Cr Silicalite of Step I. In similar fashion, Catalysts B and C were reduced and run in a fixed bed reactor as follows 20 cc of Catalyst B was reduced at ambient pressure at a temperature of 250 C under a flow of 50 SCCM Hz, 50 SCCM CO and 900 SCCM N2 overnight. The pressure was increased to 1.04MPa and flows of 50 SCCM H2 and 50 SCCM CO were introduced.The bath temperature was 2400 C and a 931 minute run was conducted. The gas contraction observed was 11.5 percent and the C liquid yield was 0.02 gms per hour. The bath temperature was increased to 2700 C and a 1539 minute run was conducted. The gas contraction observed was 37.4 percent and the Cs yield was 0.07 gms per hour. 20 cc of Catalyst C was reduced at ambient pressure at a temperature of 250 C under a flow of 50 SCCM H27 50 SCCM CO and 900 SCCM N2 overnight. The pressure was increased to 1.04 MPa and flows of 50 SCCM H2 and 50 SCCMCO were introduced. The bath temperature was 2510 C and a 217 minute run was conducted. The gas contraction observed was 29.4 percent and the C5 liquid yield was 0.17 gms per hour. The bath temperature was increased to 2600 C and a 937 minute run was conducted. The gas contraction observed was 45.7 percent and 0.35 ams of Cs product was produced per hour. The products obtained were subjected to analysis, the results of which have been summarized in Table I. The amounts of each product reported should be multiplied by 10 4 to obtain moles gm.

When this number is compared with boiling point fraction data not reported in Table I , it is possible to determine branching. Generally speaking a ratio of less than 2.5 is good for gasoline fractions and 2.0 is excellent. A value of 2.1 was observed for CatalystA. Catalyst A was next compared further againstCatalysts B and C as well as other combination catalysts not part of the present invention and three conventionalFischer Tropsch catalyst compositions which did not contain any silicalite or zeolite.

In Table IV, it is seen that Catalyst A produced the lowest amount of olefins and no oxygenates whileCatalysts B G as well as the Fischer Tropsch catalysts were particularly high in olefins. Catalysts C, D, F and G comprised unmodified silicalite and a Fischer Tropsch component for F and G, the same Fischer Tropsch component was employed and Catalyst G employed the same silicalite selected for Catalyst A. Olefins that were produced byCatalyst A were internal and trisubstituted which are more useful than the others. ore significantly, the highest yield of aromatics was obtained with Catalyst A. It is also to be noted from Table IV that the best lowest CH2 CH3 ratio was also obtained. As stated hereinabove, the methylene to methyl ratio can be utilized to determine the chain length or extent of branching. For instance, comparing the ratio of a straight chain C16 paraffin 7 1 to that for a C6 paraffin 3.0 1 it appears that the longer chain has the higher number. However, when a C8 paraffin is branched, such as iso octane the ratio becomes 1 5 or 0.20, from which it is evident that branching lowers the ratio considerably. By comparing the CH2 CH3 number with boiling point fraction data, i.e. SIMDIS simulated distillation , volume average boiling point and percent boiling under 2040C, the usefulness of the product as a gasoline former or as gasoline can also be determined. Inasmuch as greater chain length increases the CH2 CH3 ratio while branching decreases it and longer chain compounds have higher boiling points, a ratio of about 2.5 coupled with a high percent of materials boiling under 204 C, is indicative of a good gasoline former while a value of 2.0 is excellent. Based upon the satisfactory yields of liquid hydrocarbons, particularly the aromatics, the minimal amounts of olefins and lack of oxygenates that have been obtained when the catalyst of the present invention has been employed in the process set forth herein, it should be apparent that the objects of the invention have been met.It is to be understood that the catalyst of the present invention can be modified with other metals from Groups VIB or VIIB than chromium. Similarly, other Fischer Tropsch catalysts can be employed. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the process of the subject invention is operable with catalysts having fairly broad ratios of modifier to silica molecular sieve and of silica molecular sieve to FischerTropsch catalyst and that the process is operable when other temperatures, pressures and times are employed. Similarly, parameters for the preparation of the catalyst can be varied from those which have been exemplified. It is to be understood that these variables fall within the scope of the claimed invention and that the subject invention is not to be limited by the examples set forth herein.These have been provided merely to demonstrate operability and, therefore, the selection of specific catalyst components and process conditions can be determined without departing from the spirit of the invention herein disclosed and described. Moreover, the scope of the invention shall include all modifications and variations that may fall within the scope of the attached claims.
