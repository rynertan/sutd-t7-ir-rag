## Description
Pivotable holder for instrumentsThe present invention relates to a holder, adjustable to at least.two positions, for application of a visually readable instrument on a flat, vertical plane, such as a wall.Holders of this type are already known in the form of a long, flexible arm, for instance, the instrument being secured to the free end of the arm. Holders with magnetic devices are also known.The primary object of the present invention is to effect a holder of the type described which permits the instruments to be turned to one position for normal reading from the front, and to another position for normal reading from below, from a recumbent position with the body transverse to the flat, vertical surface and the head nearest the surface. Such a holder should be compact, esthetically pleasing, simple to adjust, simple to attach to the instrument, simple to attach to the wall and inexpensive to manufacture.These objectives are achieved by means of a holder having the features defined in the claims.The holder according to the invention thus comprises a member joined to the instrument, connected to a plate 2 by means of a relatively stiff hinged joint permitting the instrument to be swung between a horizontal position substantially perpendicular to the plate and a vertical position in alignment with the plate. The plate is attached in and essentially parallel to the flat, vertical surface in the following termed the wall , so that said plate can be stiffly rotated at least a half turn about an axis substantially perpendicular to the plate, to the wall and to the axis of the above mentioned joint.The instrument attached to the holder can thus be swung from its normal position facing forwards, to a horizontal position and thereafter be rotated a half turn, into a position for normal reading from below from a recumbent position with the body transverse to the wall and the head close to the wall.The invention will now be described in detail with reference to embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, in whichFigure 1 shows a cross section of a first embodiment of the holder with the instrument attached and positioned for reading from the front Figure 2 shows a cross section of the embodiment in Fi gurel positioned for reading from below Figure 3 is a cross section of the embodiment inFigure 1 positioned for reading from the front, with the addition of an adjustable bracket for securing the instrument, andFigure 4 is a cross section showing an alternative embodiment of the member for attaching the instrument.In Fig 1 the upper side of an instrument for visual reading shown in broken lines is attached along the lower side of the first plate 1 of the holder, positioned so that the instrument can be read from the front in the direction of the arrow. The instrument may be a clock, a clock radio, an ordinary radio receiver, a compass or a thermometer. The instrument may be attached to the plate 1 by means of double sided tape, glue or elastic bands. Attachment is preferably achieved by means of Velcro commat tape or the like, a strip being attached both to the lower side of the plate and the preferably flat upper side of the instrument. The instrument can then easily be removed from the holder.One edge of the first plate 1 is connected to the edge of a second plate 2 by means of a stiff hinged joint 3.The joint 3 may comprise a hinge all along the edges of the plates abutting each other. However, as shown schematically in the drawings, the joint is preferably formed by the two plates being provided with lugs protruding perpendicularly to the plates at the two ends of these edges. The distance between the lugs on the two plates should deviate somewhat to enable the lugs on one plate to be inserted between and close to the lugs on the other plate. Holes are provided in the lugs enabling them, with an elastic spacer between, to be secured pairwise by means of a rivet inserted in the appropriate holes in the lugs and the spacer. The spacer is preferably made of nylon, rubber or similar elastic material and is designed to give the joint a certain stiffness.The second plate 2 is arranged to be rotated stiffly in its attachment parallel to a third plate 4, the plates, together with an elastic spacer 5 between them, being joined together by a rivet 6. The third plate 4 is provided with holes 7 to enable the plate to be screwed to the wall 8. This attachment of the second plate 2 enables it to rotate about an axis substantially perpendicular to the plate 2, the wall 8 and the axis of the joint 3.As can be seen in Fig 2 compare Figure 1 , the plates 1 and 2 can easily be swung or rotated, respectively, so that the instrument attached is facing the correct way to be read from below. There is a certain amount of resistance to these hinge or rotary movements and the instrument attached to the holder can therefore also be directed anywhere between the two outer positions.As shown in Fig 3, the holder may also be provided with means for detachable, reinforced attachment of the instrument to the plate 1, in the form of an adjustable bracket. The attachment bracket consists of two angle plates shanks 9,10 which can be adjustably secured to each other by means of a screw 11. This is enabled by a screw threaded hole in the angle plate 9 and an elongate slot in the angle 10, said slot being slightly narrower than the diameter of the screw head. As shown in Figure 3 the adjustable bracket can be simply and detachably clamped against the plate 1 in the holder, the instrument at the same time being attached to the holder by a longitudinal slot being arranged along the joint between the plates 1 and 2. This slot is arranged between the two lugs in plate 1 and runs parallel to the axis of the joint.The simplest way of providing the slot is to extend the lugs on plate 2 to the right in the drawings, thus enabling the edge of the plate 1 facing the plate 2 to be moved to the right so that a sufficiently wide space is formed between this edge and the plate 2. An alternative embodiment of the invention, particularly suitable for somewhat heavier objects, is shown in Figure 4.According to this embodiment the plate 1 is replaced by an angle plate 12, a second angle plate 14 being displaceably arranged in one shank 13 by means of screws 11, for instance. An attachment bracket is thus produced having shanks 15, 16, which can be adjusted within wide limits for various instruments and which is capable of supporting even relatively heavy instruments or apparatus.The drawings illustrate the situation when the upper side of an instrument is secured to the lower side of the plate 1. However, the holder according to the invention permits numerous other methods of attaching the instrument. For example, in Fig 1 the rear of the instrument might be secured to the lower side of the plate 1 so that the instrument is positioned for reading from below. In this case the instrument will be positioned for reading from the front when the holder is positioned as shown in Figure 2.Additional possibilities are offered if the plate 1 in Fi gurel can also be swung down to a position parallel to the wall i.e. can be swung through an angle of 1800 in relation to the plate 2 . In this case the upper side of the plate 1 can instead be used for attachment to the upper side or rear of the instrument while retaining the function of the holder. In this case, too, the attachment can be strengthened by means of a bracket of the type described above, but facing in the opposite direction. The plates 1, 2 and 4 are shown from the side in the drawings and their actual shape is therefore not revealed.This shape may be rectangular, triangular, circular, etc.In a preferred embodiment the plate 1 is rectangular, the plate 2 triangular and the plate 4 circular, but many other combinations of shapes are naturally possible. The plates may be manufactured from brass, steel, aluminium or plastic, for instance, and are preferably relatively thin so that when folded in Figure 2 the holder takes very little space. In the embodiment shown in the drawings, the second plate 2 is attached in a plate 4 allowing the plate 2 to rotate stiffly. The plate 4 is in turn attached to the wall. It is of course possible to attach the plate 2, to rotate stiffly, directly to the wall by means of a screw, for instance, and an intermediate resilient spacer.The attachment of the instrument to the plate 1 is preferably effected at manufacture, for instance by drilling screw threaded holes in the casing of the instrument and in the plate 1 of the holder, so that the instrument can easily be screwed to the holder.The holder according to the invention is particularly suitable for attaching an alarm clock or clock radio above a bed and has the advantage of not having any protruding arms, while at the same time being simple to secure to many different types of casings for such clocks.
