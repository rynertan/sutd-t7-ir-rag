# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A PROTEIN

## Abstract
A process for producing a metalloproteinase inhibitor or a precursor thereof comprising culturing host cells trans formed with a vector including a gene coding for the metalloproteinase inhibitor or the precursor and, if appropri ate, cleaving the precursor to yield metalloproteinase inhibi tor. The precursor may be a premetalloproteinase inhibitor or a fusion protein comprising a heterologous protein and a metalloproteinase inhibitor. The metalloproteinase inhibitor has application as the effective component in a pharmaceu tical composition for the treatment of disease processes where accelerated breakdown of the extracellular organic matrix is observed.
