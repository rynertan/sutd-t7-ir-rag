## Description
SALTS OF ANTIMALARIAL PHENANTHR ENEMET HANOL COMPOUNDS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of phenanthrenemethanol compounds have been shown to exhibit antimalarial activity in humans against both chioroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The evaluation of the antimalarial activity of the phenanthrenemethanol, halofantrine or 1 1,3 dichloro 6 tr ifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 di n butyl aminopropanol hydrochloride, was reported in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Vol. 31 6 , pages 1075 79 1982 .Halofantrine was effective when administered over a short period of time and with a minimum of two doses against the multi drug resistant Vietnam Smith strain and CambodianBuchanan strain of P. falciparum and the Chesson strain ofP. vivax. However, problems with systemic bioavailability remained. A means for enhancing the bioavailability of a number of phenanthrenemethanol antimalarial compounds, including halofantrine, utilizing specific organic fatty acids, as adjuvants, has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,178,376. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to salts of the class of antimalarial compounds containing halofantr ine as the free base and its analogs, and more specifically the 3 glycerophosphate, tartrate and biquinate salts. These salts exhibit markedly increased activity against malariacausing parasites when compared to the hydrochloride salts reported in the literature. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment of subjects with malaria are also disclosed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds of this invention represented by the following structural formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing one to six carbon atoms R2 is an alkyl radical containing one to six carbon atoms and X is H203POCH CH2O n HO2CCH OH CH OH CO2Hi wherein n is 1 2 or 1, and 2HO2CC6H7 OH 4, possess markedly increased activity against malaria causing parasites. A particular class of compounds of this invention are those compounds of formula I wherein R1 is an alkyl radical containing one to six carbon atoms, and more particularly wherein both R1 and R2 are n butyl radicals. Exemplifying this class of compounds are 1 l,3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthrylI 3 di n butyl aminopropanol f3 glycerophosphate, 1 1, 3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 di n butyl aminopropanol l 2 tartrate, 1 1,3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 di n butyl aminopropanol tartrate, and 1 1,3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 di n butyl aminopropanol biquinate. A second class of compounds of this invention are those compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is a n butyl radical. Exemplifying this class of compounds is 1 l,3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phen anthryl 3 n butylaminopropanol ss glycerophosphate, 1 1,3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 n butylaminopropanol l 2 tartrate, 1 1, 3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 n butylaminopropanol tartrate, and 1 1, 3 dichloro 6 trifluoromethyl 9 phenanthryl 3 n butylaminopropanol biquinate. The compounds of this invention are conveniently prepared by reacting ss glycerophosphoric acid, tartaric acid or quinic acid 1,3,4,5 tetrahydroxycyclohexanecarboxylic acid with a compound of the formula II EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are described above in an inert solvent. The amount of B glycerophosphoric acid employed in this reaction can be between 0.75 and 1.25 moles per mole of the compound of the formula II but equimolar amounts of both reactants are preferred. To prepare the tartrate salts of formula I , wherein n is 1 2, the amount of tartaric acid employed in the reaction can be between 0.25 and 0.55 moles per mole of compound of the formula II but 0.50 moles of tartaric acid is preferred.Similarly, to prepare the tartrate salts of formula I wherein n is one, the amount of tartaric acid employed in the reaction can be between 0.75 and 1.25 moles per mole of the compound of formula II but equimolar amounts of both reactants are preferred. The amount of quinic acid employed in the above reaction can be between 1.50 and 2.50 moles per mole of the compound of the formula II but 2.0 moles of quinic acid is preferred. The compound of formula II is mixed with the appropriate amount of acid reactant 50 aqueous solution and the inert solvent is added to affect solution of the reactants at a temperature selected from the range of ambient temperature to 1000C. The reaction solution is filtered and the filtrate is heated under reduced pressure up to 1000C to remove the solvent. Upon the removal of solvent, the respective compounds of the formula I precipitate and are collected and dried. The biquinate salts of formula I are partially water soluble to about 20 percent on a weight by weight basis. Examples of the inert solvents which are utilized in the process are alcohols, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like and amides, such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide. The bases of the formula II are prepared according to the general procedures described in theJournal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 15, No. 7, pages 771 5 1972 wherein the process for converting substituted phenanthrene 9 carboxylic acid into the desired compounds as the free base form are detailed.
