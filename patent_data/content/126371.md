# FLOPPY DISK DRIVE APPARATUS

## Abstract
A floppy disk drive apparatus includes a control signal generating circuit 38 for generating a step signal and a direc tion instruction signal, head driving section 12, 40, 42, 46, 48 for driving a magnetic head in the radial direction of a floppy disk, and a detector circuit 22, 30, 32, 34, 36, 50 for generat ing an output signal when the magnetic head locates in the out er limit location of the floppy disk. The detector circuit 22, 30, 32, 34, 36, 50 is inhibited from generating an output signal in response to the direction instruction signal generated for driv ing the magnetic head in an inner direction of the floppy disk.
