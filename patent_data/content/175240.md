## Description
This application is a continuation in part of prior co pending application Serial No. 607,284, filed May 4, 1984 entitled Fishing Lure and Entrapment Device. The present invention relates generally to fish ing equipment, and more particularly to illuminated fishing lures. In the past, many attempts have been made to improve the ability of fishing lures to attract fish by enhancing the reflective or illuminative properties of the lures. For example, electrically powered lights have been tried in conjunction with fishing lures. Many problems are associated with the use of electrical lights in an under water environment, however. Water is a conductor and salt water is highly corrosive. Thus, water can cause short circuits and cause metal contacts and other parts to corrode. When the electricity for lights is supplied through power lines, the extension and maintenance of such lines is difficult and particularly impractical for sports fishing. Using a power line when fishing with a reel at any appreciable depth is not feasible. Similarly, the use of a light bulb and battery in a sealed compartment has associated problems. Insufficient illumination, heavy weight, bulky size, leakage of water into the compartment, replacement of batteries, and switching of power to the light bulb are a few of the problems. As an alternative to electrically powered lights, florescent paint has been used on fishing lures. The amount of illumination provided by such lures, however, is minimal. This is particularly true when fishing on cloudy days or at substantial depths. Attempts to provide increased illumination have been enhanced by the creation of small chemiluminescent capsules, commonly known as light sticks. Such capsules typically comprise a sealed glass tube containing a first chemical housed within an outer resilient plastic tube. A second chemical is housed intermediate the tubes. By bend ing the outer resilient tube, the inner glass tube can be broken to allow the two chemicals to react, causing illumi nation of the capsule. Chemiluminescent capsules of this type are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,576,987 to Voight, et al. Small chemiluminescent capsules are attractive for use with fishing lures because they overcome the problems discussed previously with respect to electrical or florescent systems. To date, however, the use of chemi luminescent capsules has been hampered by lack of an adequate means to readily attach and detach the capsules to a fishing line or fishing lure. A particular problem presented by existing chemi luminescent capsules is the fact that they are not manufac tured with a uniform length. The length of small capsules may vary plus or minus 10 . Such variance has created difficulties in designing fittings for such capsules which, until the present invention, have not been adequately addressed. It will be appreciated that there has been a need for a convenient and inexpensive illuminating fishing lure which does not require the use of wires, batteries, or light bulbs, and which provides an easily used, self contained source of light. The present invention fulfills this need and further provides other related advantages. It is an object of this invention to provide a fishing lure which will house a chemiluminescent capsule and allow such capsule to be readily inserted and removed therefrom. It is another object of this invention to provide such a fishing lure which will maximize the attractive effect of the chemiluminescent capsule. It is another object of this invention to provide a means for quickly attaching and detaching chemilumines cent capsules to a fishing line. It is another object of this invention to provide such fishing lures and attachment means which will work well with capsules of variable length. These and other objects which will become more apparent as the invention is described more fully below are obtained by providing, in a plurality of embodiments, fish ing lures including means for releasably securing chemilumi nescent capsules therein. Releasable mountings are sized to receive and snuggly hold the resilient chemiluminescent capsules and enable them to be readily poped out and replaced, despite possible variances in length. In one group of preferred embodiments, the chemi luminescent capsules are releasably mounted within a reflec tive plate to illuminate both sides of the plate. In another group of preferred embodiments, the chemilumines cent capsules are mounted in the interior of an opaque lure for easy insertion and removal. Another preferred embodi ment enables a chemiluminescent capsule to be readily affixed to a segment of fishing line.

Figure 21 is a detail view of an alternative form of surface irregularity for the outer surface of the lures of Figures 18 and 19. Fishing lures according to the present invention are designed to allow chemiluminescent capsules to be easily and quickly inserted and removed from the lure, and yet be snuggly held in the lure. Some preferred embodi ments of the invention are specially designed to accommo date capsules of variable length. In a first group of embodiments, chemiluminescent capsules are housed within a relatively thin reflective plate such that a capsule projects outwardly beyond each side of the plate. This arrangement allows light to project on each side of the plate, as well as reflect off each side of the plate. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a fishing lure 10 which comprises a preferred embodiment wherein a chemilumi nescent capsule 12 is housed within an elongated reflective plate 14. The chemiluminescent capsule has a generally circular cross section with a resilient outer casing. As mentioned above, commercially available capsules of this type can vary in length up to ten percent from the nominal length. In the lure of Figures 1 and 2, the capsule is mounted in the correspondingly shaped slot 16 in the center of the plate. The width of the slot is substantially equal to the diameter of the capsule, such that the resilient capsule can fit snuggly within the slot and remain in there during use. As best seen in Figure 2, the capsule extends outwardly beyond the top face 18 and the bottom face 20 of the plate. The plate is preferably fabricated of reflec tive material, or fabricated to include a reflective coat ing on its top and bottom faces. This arrangement allows the capsule to project light outwardly in both directions and allows the light to relfect off the top and bottom faces of the plate, thereby enhancing the luminescent properties of the lure. The chemiluminescent capsule is held in the slot by two frustraconically shaped fittings 26, 28 placed at each end of the slot. The fittings are sized to receive the tapered ends 30 of the capsule, as seen in Figure 2. These fittings combined with the specially sized slot to securly hold the capsule despite possible variances in length. In operation, the fishing lure of Figures 1 and 2 is first tied or threaded to a fishing line through the aperture at one end of the plate and a hook is attached to the plate by the aperture at the other end. A chemilumi nescent capsule is then activated by bending the capsule to break the inner glass tube. The activated capsule may then be inserted into the slot by placing the ends of the capsule into the respective fittings. When fishing is complete, or the capsule needs replacing, pressure is applied to the center of the capsule to easily pop it out of the slot and fittings. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a fishing lure 32 of essentially the same design illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Elements corresponding to those illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 are given common reference numerals. The fishing lure includes fittings formed by opposed angles 32, 34, 36, 38 which are stamped out of a plate 14 during fabrication. A top angle 32, 38 and bottom angle 34, 36 are adjacent each end of the slot and are sized to receive and support the ends of the capsule and retain it in the slot, despite possible variances in the capsule length. An alternate preferred embodiment of the inven tion is illustrated in Figure 15. A fishing lure 40 includes an elongated plate 42 having a concaved top surface 44 and a convex bottom surface 46. At least the concave surface is preferably reflective. Rounded fittings 48, 50 extend outwardly from the top surface as shown in Figure 15. These fittings can be stamped out of the plate during fabrication, in which case an aperture 52 will be formed beneath each fitting as illustrated in Figure 15. A chemiluminescent capsule 53 is housed within the fittings during use. The lure includes apertures 54, 56 at each end of the plate to enable a fishing line 58 or leader assembly 60 to be attached to the plate. The plate includes a slot 62 in the centre portion to allow light from the chemilumi nescent capsule to pass through the plate. The slot is preferably wider than the chemiluminescent capsule to enable maximum illumination on the back side of the plate. In operation, light from the capsule can pass through the slot to the back side of the plate, project directly out ward from the front of the plate, and be reflected by the concave surface toward the front side of the plate. Figure 10 illustrates another embodiment of a fishing lure 64 similar to that illustrated in Figures 1 4. An elongated plate 66 is designed to hold a resilient chemi luminescent capsule 68 within an elongated slot 70 in the plate. Cylindrical fittings 72, 74 are riveted to the plate at each end of the slot to receive the ends of the capsule. The fittings are sized to be substantially the same diameter as the capsule and include slot 76 running longitudinally through the fitting to enable it to expand slightly as necessary to receive a capsule. Figures 5 7 illustrate alternate preferred embodi ments of the invention which include cylindrical housings for receiving and storing chemiluminescent capsules. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a fishing lure 80 having a hollow elongated cylindrical housing 82. In a preferred embodiment illustrated herein, end caps 84, 86 close the respective ends of the cylindrical housing, although integral ends could also be used. The housing includes a plurality of slots 88 running lengthwise along the cylindri cal housing and extending from the exterior of the housing to the hollow interior portion thereof. The width of the slots is substantially equal to the diameter of the capsule so that the resilient capsule can be pushed into the interior of the cylindrical housing through the slots, and yet not accidentally fall out of the slot during use. Because the outer tube of the capsule is formed of resilient material, a capsule of a given diameter can be inserted through a slot having a width which is equal to, slightly greater than, or even slightly less than the diameter of the capsule. The slot width should be sized to be substantial equal to the diameter such that the resilient capsule can be inserted through the slot, yet will not fall freely out of the slot during use. Capsules are removed from the lure by inserting an object through one slot to engage the capsule and force it through another slot. The housing thus preferably includes at least two slots, each being sized to allow insertion and removal of a capsule through either slot. Figure 7 illustrates a modified version of the embodiments of Figures 5 and 6. The lure 89 has an external configuration similar to that of Figures 5 and 6. The cylindrical housing includes thicker walls than the housing 88 of Figures 5 and 6. A pair of slots 92, 94 extend through the walls to allow insertion and removal of the capsules therethrough. The housing includes an annular groove 96 in the exterior portion thereof extending along the length of the housing. An annular spring 98 is mounted within the groove. The spring acts to deter a capsule not shown housed in the interior of the housing from acciden tally falling out of the lure. Figure 9 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the invention. A lure 100 includes a translucent, elongat ed body 102 fabricated generally in the shape of a small fish. Hooks 104, 106 depend from the body. A cylindrical capsule bore 108 extends longitudinally from the rear end of the body to a location in the interior of the body. The diameter of the capsule bore is sized to be substantially equal to the diameter of the chemiluminescent capsule 110 so that the chemiluminescent capsule can be slid into the bore and it will be held in place by the frictional engage ment between the capsule and the interior wall surface of the bore. Extending forwardly from the capsule bore is a relatively small bore 112 which extends from the forward end of the capsule bore to the forward end of the lure body. This relatively small bore is used during removal of a capsule from the capsule bore. A small object such as a pin or wire is inserted into the relatively small bore to contact the forward end of the capsule and forced it rear wardly to remove the capsule from the capsule bore. Figure 18 illustrates a fishing lure 114 accord ing to the present invention. An elongated body 116 includes a cylindrical bore 118 extending longitundinally through the body from a first opening 120 at the rear of the body to a second opening at the front of the body. The bore is sized such that its diameter is substantially equal to the diameter of a chemiluminescent capsule to be stored in the bore. A slot 122 extends transversely from the bore to the exterior of the lure body as shown in Figure 18. In operation, the lure of Figure 18 is used by inserting an activated chemiluminescent capsule into the bore. The body of the lure is preferably fabricated of translucent material so that light from the capsule can project from the bore through the body of the lure to attract fish. To remove a chemiluminescent capsule from the bore, a thin object such as a knife blade is aligned with the slot at one end of the bore and pushed through the slot and bore to force the capsule out of the bore. Another capsule may then be inserted into the bore as desired. Figure 19 illustrates a lure 124 similar to the embodiment of Figure 18, having a bore 126 and a slot 128 communicating therewith. The outer surface of the lure 114 of Figure 18 includes a plurality of convex protrusions 130 on its outer surface to diffuse the light from the chemiluminescent capsule. Other surface irregularities, such as the concave indentations 132 illustrated in Figure 19, the scale like projections 134 illustrated in Figure 20, or the strake like projections 136 of Figure 21 may also be used to accom plish the same purpose. Such surface irregularities will cause light from the chemiluminescent capsule to project from the lure at varying angles and additionally cause acoustical effects similar to the sound of fish traveling through water. Figures 16 and 17 illustrate a fishing lure 137 having an elongated body 138 including an elongated hollow cavity 140 therein for housing a chemiluminescent capsule 142. The cavity is defined by two opposed planar side walls 144, 146 as best illustrated in Figure 17, which are spaced apart a distance substantially equal to the diameter of the chemiluminescent capsule. A relatively shallow recess 148 extends along the length of one side wall at a location in the interior of the side wall as seen in Figure 17. In operation, a chemiluminescent capsule can be inserted between the side walls and located within the recess. The extra room provided by the recess allows the resilient capsule to expand and rest in the interior of the cavity. Unless a force is applied to the capsule, it will tend to remain within the recess. When removal is desired, the capsule is merely pushed out of the recess and through the side walls to remove it from the lure. The body of the lure illustrated in Figure 16 additionally includes small apertures 150, 152 extending from each end of the cavity to the corresponding exterior end of the body to allow a fishing line 154 or lure accessory 156 to be attached to the lure as desired. An apparatus according to the present invention for attaching a chemiluminescent capsule to a segment of fishing line is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12. A capsule holder 158 comprises an elongated wire member 160 having loops 162, 164 for supporting a chemiluminescent capsule illustrated in phantom line . The interior dimen sions of the loop are sized substantially equal to the exterior dimensions of the capsule such that a capsule can be snuggly held within the loops by inserting it there through. The member 160 may be manufactured from an appropriate metal or plastic. At each end of the wire member are resilient line fasteners 168, 170. As best illustrated in Figure 12, line fasteners comprise a bent segment of wire forming two pair of adjacent wire segments 172, 174 between which a fishing line 176 or the like may be threaded as illustrated in Figure 12. This arrangement alllows a chemiluminescent capsule to be readily attached and detached from a fishing line. Once a capsule is inserted in the loops, the capsule holder is attached to the line by threading the line fasteners in the manner illustrated in Figure 12. The capsule holder will remain in place during use and can be quickly removed from a fishing line when desired. Figure 8 illustrates a similar arrangement accord ing to the present invention where a fish hook 178 includes two spaced apart loops 180, 182 integrally formed therein for receiving and retaining a chemiluminescent capsule 184. The interior of the loops are sized substantially equal to the exterior of the capsule. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate a preferred embodi ment of the present invention comprising a fish lure 186 having a preferably translucent body 188. An air cavity 190 is provided in the rear of the body for bouyancy. If desired, a weight may be inserted within the cavity. A bore 192 extends diagonally across the body when viewed in plan, for receiving a chemiluminescent capsule. The bore extends from one side of the lure body to the other and is sized such that its diameter is substantially equal to the diameter of the chemiluminescent capsule to be housed in the bore. In operation, a capsule is inserted into the bore for use. When it is desired to remove the capsule, an object is inserted into one end of the bore to force the capsule out the other end of the bore. Although the invention has been described and disclosed herein with respect to particular embodiments thereof, it is not intended that the invention be limited to these embodiments, but include all embodiments which are within the spirit of the invention.
