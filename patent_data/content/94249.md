# AN ACTUATOR FOR USE IN AN ENGINE PROTECTION OR SHUTDOWN SYSTEM AND A SHUTDOWN SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An actuator 14 for use in an engine protection or shut down system, connectable to a source of fluid under pressure 12 , which has a body 170 defining a chamber 172 , an inlet port 29 and a vent port 224 , and a cup shaped piston 188 and rolling diaphragm 194 connected to a rod which is electri cally actuated by a solenoid valve 240 to selectively move the rod from a first to a second position, to selectively connect the source of fluid to the vent port or the inlet port thus causing a shift between a shutdown and a run position. The invention extends to a shutdown system for an internal combustion engine including such an actuator in which the source of pressurized fluid may also include fluid control means 102 and pressure regulating valve means 296 .
