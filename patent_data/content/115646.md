# Oxidation catalysts and their preparation procedure.

## Abstract
This invention provides a catalyst composition for gas phase oxidation, ammoxidation and oxidative dehydrogena tion of olefins to unsaturated aldehydes, unsaturated nitriles and dienes respectively comprising a solid solution of Fe, Sb and Ti oxides with a rutile crystal structure for at least 80 b.w., and which is represented by the empirical for mula Fe
