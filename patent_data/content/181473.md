## Description
COMPONENTS FOR CARTRIDGE FOR HUNTING, SHOOTING PURPOSES AND THE LIKE OF PHOTODEGRADABLE SYNTHETIC PLASTIC MATE RIAL Background of the Invention The present invention relates to components for cartridge for hunting, shooting purposes and the like in particular, tubular body of the cartridge case constituted by photodegradable polymeric compositions comprising a synthetic polymer, in particular polyethylene, and a photoactivator. It is known that a hunting and shooting cartridge hereinafter called as cartridge is constituted by a cartridge case and by a launch wad , said cartridge case containing the gunpower and said wad housed inside the cartridge case containing the lead pellets. The cartridge case is formed in its turn by a metal base incorporating the initiator and by a tubular body solidly fastened to the base by means of a base wad or plug . In the cartridge cases of the monobloc type, the metal base is not present . Said tubular body is made of paper, or of synthetic plastic material, this latter material being presently preferred to paper, due to various known reasons of economic and productive character, and of practical use. When said tubular body is made of paper, no problems of environmental pollution arise, in that the paper is easily biodegradable under the contact with the ground on to which the cartridge case is generally abandoned after the shooting of the cartridge. When on the contrary the tubular body is constituted by plastic material, such as e.g. and in particular medium high density polyethylene, environmental problems of various kinds arise, in that, as it is well known, said polyethylene as in general plastic materials is not bio degradable. Similar considerations are true for the launch and base wads. The problem hence exists of providing a cartridge for hunting, shooting purposes and the like, provided with a cartridge case tubular body and with wads launch and base wad made of photodegradable synthetic plastic material. In particular, the problem exists of providing a cartridge case, whose tubular body is constituted by pho todegradable medium high density polyethylene, undergoing biodegradation after having been photodegraded. It is known on the other side that the problem of ren dering biodegradable some types of plastic materials in connection with their throw away use has been dealt with and solved in other technical fields, in particular in the field of LDPE low density polyethylene for agri cultural use as an instance, for the stubble mulching of market garden and orchard cultivations and in some types of non returnable packages, such as e.g., wraps for 2 6 cans, or bottles for picnic drinks. In the case of LDPE as well as for other polymers , in order to have a biodegradable product, inside the sameLDPE a photoinitiator is incorporated, i.e., a substance capable of absorbing from solar spectrum radiations causing molecular breakdowns in the polymer, so that the same polymer, photodegraded to a low molecular weight, may then become susceptible to biodegradation under the contact with the ground bacteria. As the photoinitiator agents or photoactivator agents or however agents suitable to facilitate the photo degradation , several substances have been proposed. As an example, Friedman et al. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 20, NO 4, Apr. 1976, p. 911 and p. 921 and NO 2, Feb.1976, p. 463 , to the purpose of achieving LDPE biodegradable films, suggest the use of halo carbonyls, sulphohalo alkyls, aryl methyl halogenides, phenyl halo methylketones, halo alkenes, and N bromosuccinimide. U.K. Patent 1,519,529 and the corresponding U.S. Pat ent 4,028,480 teach how to render photodegradable some polymeric compositions, in particular films of polyethylene with density 0.92 hence, LDPE , by incorporating into the same polyethylene at least a ferrous salt selected among Fe II dodecylsuccinate, Fe II 6 O palmitoyl 1 ascorbate, , Fe II monolauryl ethanolamido sulphosuccinate, Fe II monostearyl sulphosuccinate, Fe II N pal mitoyl glutamate, Fe II N lauroyl aspartate, Fe II 2sulphopalmitate, and Fe II O palmitoylgluconate. At last, U.K. Patent 1,486,164 teaches how to prepare photodegradable films of LDPE for application in the agricultural field, by incorporating di furfurylidene cyclo alkenone in the same polyethylene. Besides by the above methods, LDPE can be rendered photodegradable by introducing carbonyl groups inside the ethylene chain, and i.e. by preparing ethylene carbon monoxide copolymers, as W.P. Bremer Polym. Plast. Technol.Eng., 18, NO 2, 1982, p. 137 148 , and V. Pozzi et al J.Appl. Polym. Sci., 19, N 4, Apr. 1975, p. 923 teach. It is evident from the above that the problem has not been faced yet, and least of all solved, of the avail ability of a cartridge case, whose tubular body is made of photodegradable medium high density polyethylene, said problem showing several types of difficulties, such as those, in particular, that the physical mechanical characteristics of the polyethylene intended for forming the tubular body of the cartridge case should not be altered, and that alterations of the equipment and of the operating conditions of the manufacturing process of said tubular body should not be caused. Disclosure of the Invention Purpose of the present invention is hence that of providing a cartridge case for cartridge for hunting, shooting and the like, whose tubular body is constituted by photodegradablle plastic material, in particular pho todegradable medium high density polyethylene, by incorporating in the same polyethylene a photoactivator agent of the degradation reaction of the polymeric chain of said polyethylene, so that this latter, after having been photodegraded, results then biodegradable, said photoactivator agent being of such a nature as not to induce significant alterations in the physical mechanical characteristics of said polyethylene, and not to require alterations to the equipment and to the operating conditions of the manufacturing process of said tubular body. Another purpose of the invention ia that of providing a hunting and shooting cartridge which in addition to said tubular body of the cartridge case has also the usual ancillary components base wad and or launch wad made of photodegradable plastic material. These and further purposes which may be evident from the following disclosure are achieved, according to the present invention, by means of a cartridge case having its tubular body constituted by a photodegradable polymeric composition comprising polyethylene of density 0.930 0.960 preferably 0.945 0.950 and a photoactivator con stituted by at least a ferric salt, selected among Fe III stearate, Fe III di butyl dithiocarbamate, Fe III acetylacetonate and Fe III naphthenate, said photoactivator being in amounts of from 6 to 300 ppm parts per million by weight , expressed as Fe relatively to the said composition, the same photoactivator making it possible both the physical mechanical characteristics of said polyethylene, and the apparatus and the operating conditions of the manufacturing process of said tubular body to be maintained substantially unaltered. The preferred amount of said activator to be incor prorated in said polyethylene is preferably of 12 125 ppm as expressed as Fe . Always according to the invention, the ancillary com ponents of the cartridge, having functions of retention and tightening base wad or plug and of containment launch wad are constituted by plastic compositions based on photodegradable medium high density polyethylene as described above, or also based on photodegradableLDPE or on any other suitable photodegradable plastic ma terials. The advantages of the invention are implicit in what already above said, as the same invention provides, in a simple and cheap way, a cartridge case with tubular body of photodegradable medium high density polyethylene, said tubular body resulting after the photodegradation easily biodegradable by the ground on which the cartridge case may be left after its end use cartridge shooting , whilst, on the other hand, the same cartridge case, as con sidered as a whole, does not suffer alterations during its storage time before said end use. The same is true for the base wad and the launch wad. The following examples, given only to exemplifying and not limitative purposes of the invention shall serve to the purpose of better illustrating the invention itself. Example 1 By using an extruder and the related conventional complementary pieces of equipment of known type, as well as as the starting plastic material polyethylene of density of 0.945, the six tube types indicated hereinunder wee extruded, which, after the stretching and blowing operations accomplished by means of conventional known methods , are of 20 mm in diameter, and of 0.6 mm in thickness colourless tubes containing respectively 0 , 0.05 and 0.1 of Fe III stearate EFe III STEA red coloured tubes containing respectively 0 , 0.05 and 0.1 of Fe III stearate. The said amounts of 0.05 and 0.1 of Fe III stearate correspond to 31 and 62 ppm of Fe respectively . From the said six tube types lenghtes 75 mm long were obtained, which were then used for the photodegradation tests described hereinunder, and precisely a Weathering test, with indirect solar radiations specimens shielded at distance from the direct radiation to this test colourless tube lengthes respectively containing 0 and 0.1 of Fe III STEA were submitted. The test results as reported in Table 1 are express ed as index values resulting from the following evaluation method after the various exposure times, from each tube length 3 specimens of 25 mm in length are cut, each of said specimens is then deformed by an outer pressure along one of its generatrices, by means of a suitable inner shaped mandrel and outer punch with prismatic relief of 900 , so as to obtain two longitudinal bendings along which the material results in a tensional state. The specimens so deformed are immersed over 18 hours together with the related mandrel punch assemblies, which keep them deformed, the same being solidy linked to each other by means of suitable screws in distilled water containing 5 by weight of a surfactant agent ARCOPAL 100 , and constantly maintained at 65 10C. After such a stress cracking time, the specimens are removed from the related mandrel punch assemblies, then washed in running water and dried, and then visually evaluated as follows the crackings produced in correspondence of the said two longitudinal bendings are observed and counted, to each cracking a subjective value of from 0 to 100 being assigned, as a function of the cracking type, and precisely cracking from side to side very bad 100 long deep cracking bad 80 short deep cracking poor 60 long superficial cracking medium 40 short superficial cracking good 20 no cracking very good 0In Table 1 and subsequently in Table 2 too , with 1,max the worst index value observed is indicated, whilst with M the average value is indicated, which is obtained by adding up all the index values assigned to each cracking observed, and dividing the sum obtained by 6 3 specimens x 2 bending observation zones 6 . b weathering test, with direct radiation specimens oriented southwards, with 450 inclination to this test both colourless specimens with Fe STEA in amounts of 0 and 0.05 respectively , and red coloured specimens withFe STEA contents of 0 , 0.05 and 0.1 respectively were submitted. The results, evaluated as previously described under a are reported in Table 1. c Test of exposure to solar lamp in this test, of known type, a 300 W OSRAM Ultravitalux lamp was used, placing the specimens at a distance of 17.5 cm from the light source. The temperature measured in theqregion of the specimens resulted of about 55 C. After the various exposure times, the specimens were evaluated, both by the method as described under previous point a the results are reported in Table 2 , and by carrying out tests of elongation at break, with testing rate of 50 mm minute, in an environment maintained at 230C with relative humidity of 50 . The values obtained are reported in Table 3, each value representing the average of five measurements on colourless specimens . Clearly, the greater the photodegradation, the lower the elongation at break. d Comparison test all the six tube types, both co lourless and red, indicated above, have been stored in a closed space within boxes and hence protected from the atmospheric agents over a 1 year time period after that time, no specimen showed even the smallest cracking.

Example 2 The Example 1 has been repeated limitedly to the test of exposure to the solar lamp, with the determination of the variations of elongation at break , preparing and using different types of specimens tube lengthes constituted by compositions comprising Fe III stearate in the amounts of 0.05 and 0.1 as in Example 1 and polyethylene having densities different to those of said Example 1, and precisely of 0.930 and 0.960. Results practically equal to those obtained in Example 1 with polyethylene of density 0.945 Fe STEA 0.05 and 0.1 were obtained. Example 3 Example 1 was repeated limitedly to the tests of ex posure to the solar lamp, with the determination of the variations of elongation at break , preparing and using different types of tube lengthes, all constituted by polyethylene of density 0.945 respectively containing Fe III di butyl ditiocarbamate, Fe III aceylacetonate, and Fe III naphthenate, the said Fe III salts being all present in amounts corresponding to 31 ppm of iron. Results practically equivalent to those as obtained in Example 1 with the specimens constituted by the same polyethylene and containing Fe III stearate in the amount of 0.05 corresponding to 31 ppm of iron were obtained. Example 4 Following the procedures as of Example 1, and using always polythene with density 0.945, tube lengthes of black colour black specimens were prepared, and then submitted both to the test of exposure to the weathering agents with direct radiation and to the test of exposure to the solar lamp, according to the examination criteria as already described in the same Example 1. The results obtained are shown respectively in Table 4 and in Table 5. The comparison test analogous to that as under d of Example 1 did not show crackings on the specimens. Example 5 Three types of hunting cartridges of conventional shape were prepared, using polyethylene of density 0.945 colourless for the relevant cartridge case tubular body.
