# Anastomosis devices and kit.

## Abstract
Devices, kits and methods for non suture end to end and end to side anastomosis of tubular tissue members employ tubular connection members having clip retaining elements comprising annular grooves or flanges in the connection members and spring clips which comprise a ring shaped body with separable opposed ends whereby a circular opening defined by the body can be enlarged the opposed ends have handling elements to faciliate handling of the clips and separation of the opposed ends specially developed instruments faciliate use of the devices and the anastomosis procedure can be completed much more rapidly than with conventional techniques and has the significant advantage of intima to intima contact at the site of anastomosis with no foreign material exposed to the lumen of the vessels being joined.
