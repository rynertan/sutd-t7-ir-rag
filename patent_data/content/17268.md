# Device for dividing a recurrent input signal by a non integer divisor f, notably by f N 1 2, and its use in a television receiver display.

## Abstract
A description is given of a number of dividers for a non integer divisor f, notably f N 1 2. The divider comprises a chain of dynamic bistable elements, at least one of which is activated in reaction to the positive going signal edges, while at least one is activated in reaction to the negative going signal edges. A description is given of completely synchro nous circuits and substantially synchronous circuits. Also given is a simple implementation for dividers with an arbitrary, so also very large dividor. Such dividers may be used in television receivers for the production of line and frame synchronization signals from the periodic alternating voltage.
