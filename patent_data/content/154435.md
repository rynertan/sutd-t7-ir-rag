A vehicle door structure having a door 2 equipped with a door frame 10 . The door frame 10 has a door glass run 4 at its inner peripheral portion in order to seal a passenger compartment from the outside. The door glass run 4 comprises an inner lip 44 , and an outer lip 46 . The inner lip 44 is in contact with an interior surface of a door glass 6 . and the outer lip 46 is in contact with an exterior surface of the door glass 6 . The outer lip 46 has an inclined tip portion 460, 462 and a prop portion 461, 464 . The inclined tip portion 460, 462 is in contact with the exterior surface of the door glass 6 , and the prop portion 461, 464 can sustain the door glass biased toward the exterior of the door by the force generated by the difference of the pressure caused between the passenger compartment and the exterior sur face of the door when a vehicle runs at a high speed.
