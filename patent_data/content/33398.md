## Abstract
A rotary, self cleaning disk type rasp 1 for tending the claws of animals, comprising a disk shaped body 2 arranged to be secured to a hand tool. Except at its circumferential edge, the disk body 2 is provided with spaced holes 5 therethrough, and cutters 8 are provided at all, or substan tially all, said holes 5 , said cutters 8 having a working edge 9 projecting from the plane of the body 2 .

## Claims
CLAIM A rotary, self cleaning disk type rasp, in particular for tending the claws of animals, characterized by a planar, rigid body in the form of an annular disk having a working surface on one side, and on the other a central recess with a central aperture for being secured to an electric hand tool, the disk having a plurality of holes therethrough, spaced apart a distance no greater than thrice the hole diameter and arranged in such a manner that when the disk rotates the paths of movement of the holes overlap radially, there being provided cutting means at all, or substantially all, said holes, said cutting means having a working edge projecting from said working surface, the projection of said working edge on said working surface falling within the relevant hole edge, a plurality of holes being arranged adjacent the circumference of the disk, but so that the circumferential edge of the working surface is smooth.

## Description
Rasp This invention relates to a rasp, in particular to a rotary diÂµ type rasp for the care of the claws or hooves of animals. In treating horn and like material, known tools, such as cutters, grinding disks and rasps having a fine abrasive action have the disadvantage of becoming rapidly filled up. In other words the material removed rapidly fills up the spaces between the projecting knives, grains and the like, whereby the tool becomes inoperative and must be cleaned. In addition such tools require relatively much energy in work such as tending the claws of a cow. It is an object of the present invention to remove these disadvantages. According to the invention, there is provided a rotary, self cleaning disk type rasp, characterized by a planar, rigid body in the form of an annular disk having a working surface on one side, and on the other a central recess with a central aperture for being secured to an electric hand tool, the disk having a plurality of holes therethrough, spaced apart a distance no greater than thrice the hole diameter and arranged in such a manner that when the disk rotates the paths of movement of the holes overlap radially, there being provided cutting means at all, or substantially all, said holes, said cutting means having a working edge projecting from said working surface, the projection of said working edge on said working surface falling within the relevant hole edge, a plurality of holes being arranged adjacent the circumference of the disk, but so that the circumferential edge of the working surface is smooth. It is noted that a rotary disk type rasp, in particular design ed for drilling blind holes in wood or the like, is known. In it, three chip discharge holes are formed in the body, which holes extend up to the circumference of the disk, and along the edges of which holes cutter elements are disposed, while further the working surface is provided with cutter elements along its circumference. Such a device, however, is utterly unsuitable for the care of animal claws. The device of the present invention enables a claw or hoof to be fully processed, i.e. to be ground flat and also, if desired, in concave form, and further provides the possibility to perform a grinding operation in the slits between the hoof portions. Furthermore, by taking care that the circumferential edge of the working surface is smooth, there is no risk of the animal being injured when accidentally contacted bythe msp. Furthermore, snce there are used separate cutting means, instead of portions bent out of the material itself, it is possible to make these of tungsten carbide platelets, thereby to ensure that the service life of the rasp becomes considerably longer. One embodiment of the rasp, formed as a disk type rasp, will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of the working surface of the rasp Fig. 2 is an axial sectional view of the rasp, taken on the line II II of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 shows a detail in sectional view, taken on the line III III of Fig. 1. As shown in the drawings, the disk type rasp 1 has a body 2 in the form of a rigid, planar, annular disk having a recess 3 in the centre with a central aperture 4 for securing the rasp as an attachment to an electric hand tool not shown. The direction of rotation is shown by an arrow R. Formed in disk 2 are a plurality of holes 5 with cutters 8 counter sunk in appropriate recesses 7 and, for example, fixed by soldering, on the side of working surface 6. Cutters 8 have a working or cutting edge 9 located a distance a above working surface 6, and are placed so that the projection of their working edge 9 on the working surface of the disk falls within the relevant hole edge, and chips removed by the cutting edge 9 can be directly discharged through the associated hole 5. Taking into account the direction of rotation R, the cutters are disposed in a trailing position relative to holes 5. The holes are distributed over the entire radial width of the annular disk, even close to its outer circumference, but so that the circumferential edge of the disk is not interrupted. The holes are spaced apart a distance no greater than thrice their diameter, and are arranged in such a pattern that during rotation of disk 1 their paths of movement overlap radially, so that virtually the entire working surface 6 is covered. When the rasp is used as a claw tending tool, excellent results are obtained with the following parameters disk diameter approx. 11 cm number of holes approx. 24 hole diameter approx. 8 mm distance a approx. 1.5 mm speed 7800 10,000 rpm. It is clear that the invention is not limited to the embodiment described and shown herein. Modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the sc ope of the invention.
