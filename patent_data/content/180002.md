# Filling method.

## Abstract
A process for filling seven rod shaped objects into a cylindrical container wherein a group of seven parallel rod shaped objects supported in two adjacent rows of four and three respectively and having a substantially trapeziform configuration in cross sectional outline, is forced lengthwise through a funnel 31, 32 whose internal wall defines a longitudinal fin and is suitably profiled to undergo a gradual transition in cross sectional outline from roughly trapezi form at the inlet to roughly hexagonal at the outlet so as to guide longitudinally and rearrange the rod shaped objects to have substantially the configuration in cross sectional outline of a regular hexagon, the longitudinal fin positioned to contact, and shaped to guide the middle rod shaped object of the row of three to the centre of the hexagon while simultaneously the outer rod shaped objects of the row of three are guided to form the adjacent corners of the hex agon on either side of the fin, the two inner rod shaped objects of the row of four are guided to form the adjacent corners of the hexagon opposite the longitudinal fin and the two outer rod shaped objects of the row of four are guided to form the remaining corners of the hexagon, in which configuration the group of rod shaped objects is forced out of the funnel into the container.
