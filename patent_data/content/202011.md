# Torque motors and valve assemblies.

## Abstract
A torque motor is arranged at each end of a common shaft, e.g. for driving a servo valve. The motor comprises a rotor and a stator. Preferably, the rotor carries at least one pair of samarium cobalt permanent magnets at radially spaced positions, the core material being disposed between the magnets. Such a motor can be relatively compact whilst producing a high torque.
