# PYROLYTIC PROCESS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A pyrolysis process and reactor converts various hydro carbons such as waste materials, for example, scrap poly mers, tires, etc., into various chemical components or amounts thereof, not otherwise produced by conventional pyrolytic processes. A large reactor size is utilized in asso ciation with a low heat input per unit weight of charge. A thick pyrolyzate char layer is formed during pyrolysis. The product or various components thereof can be utilized as a fuel or octane additive.
