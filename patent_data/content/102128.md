# R.F. BALANCED MIXER

## Abstract
An R.F. balanced mixer comprises on an insulating substrate 3 with opposed major surfaces a balanced first transmission line having a pair of conductors 18, 19 on a first major surface and an unbalanced second transmission line having a strip conductor 15 on one major surface and a ground conductor 13 on the side of the substrate 3 remote from the strip conductor 15 . Two diodes 24, 25 are conductively connected between the pair of conductors 18, 19 of the first line and the strip conductor 15 of the second line to form an arrangement operable as a 180 hybrid junction, the first line coupling an R.F. signal to the diodes 24, 25 and the second line coupling an L.O. signal to and an I.F. signal from the diodes 24, 25 . To reduce the impedance of the I.F. signal ground return path and inhibit resonant effects, the pair of conductors 18, 19 of the first line to which the diodes 24, 25 are respectively connected are on the same major surface as the strip conductor 15 of the second line and are coupled to the ground conductor 13 of the second line by means which include conductive connec tions e.g. 33, 34 through the substrate 3 and which present a low impedance to the L.O. and I.F. signals.
