## Abstract
A conductance limit plate 14 divides the vacuum cham ber into two portions 30 and 31 which are separately evac uated by pumps 28 and 27, respectively, to maintain molecular flow conditions. Coil 25 generates axial magnetic field B while an ionising electron beam is directed from gun 32 to collector 38. Sample introduced into chamber 31 in creases the pressure in this chamber and thus increases the ionization. Orifice 20 of plate 14 is small enough to maintain the pressure differential between the chambers but ions will equilibrate between the chambers, resulting in an increase in the transient decay time in chamber 30 to facilitate exci tation and analysis. Trapping plates 10 and 11 trap the ions between the plates by reason of the potential applied to the plates.
