Just and T. J. Liak, Can. J. Chem., 56, 211 1978 , which comprises treating the TBDMS ether derivative withN tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride in the presence of acetic acid in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of from 780C to ambient temperature for from a few minutes to 72 hours c. for carboxyl moieties possessing an allyl moiety and for hydroxyl and amino groups bearing an allyloxycarbonyl function deprotection is accomplished by treatment with a combination of triphenyl phosphine, tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium 0 , and 2 ethylhexanoic acid or its sodium or potassium salts in a suitable aprotic solvent such as ethylacetate, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, or diethylether.Use of either sodium or potassium 2 ethyihexanoate provides the corresponding salt whereas 2 ethylhexanoic acid provides the free carboxylic acid. The process for removing an allylic grouP from allylic esters, carbonates and carbamates is described inEuropean Patent Application 13,633 Scherinq Corp. and in S.W.

EXAMPLE 18EMI67.1 2 tN,N Dimethyl carbamimidoylmethylthio pen 2 em 3 carboxylic acid 19 A solution of sulfoxide 16 1.47 g, 4 mmol in anhydrous DMF 12 ml is cooled in a dry ice CC14 bath under a N2 atm. and treated simultaneously and dropwise over 4 minutes with iPr2NEt 0.77 ml, 4.4 mmol and a solution of N,N dimethylcarbamimidoylrnethyl mercaptan hydrochloride 0.62 g, 4 mmol in DMSO 8 ml . After stirring for 10 minutes at 200, the mixture is added to a rapidly stirring mixture of supercel 16 g in Et20 400 ml . The mixture is stirred for a few minutes and filtered. The supercel pad is washed with more Et2O 400 ml and sucked dry under a rubber dam. The crude intermediate 17 is extracted from the supercel by successive washing with THF 100 ml H20 30 ml , THF 20 ml , and 0.1M pH 7.1 phosphate buffer 110 ml . The combined extracts are divided into two equal portions and each is hydrogenated with 10 Pd C 0.7 g for 2 hours at 45 psi. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is washed with Et2O 2 X 250 ml . The aqueous portion is concentrated under vacuum and charged onto a Dowex 50W X 4 column 500 ml, Na form, 200 400 mesh which is eluted with H2O in a cold room. The appropriate fractions, as determined by UV spectroscopy, are combined, concentrated under vacuum, and lyophilized to afford the title compound 18.
