# Reciprocator for operating head.

## Abstract
Apparatus for moving a reciprocating fluid emission head C automatically through successive operating cycles, into and from a space within which predetermined opera tions are to be performed. The apparatus includes a frame 20 mounted at one side of the operating space, a crankshaft 47 journaled in the frame 20 and rotary drive means 40 including a motor 41 for turning the crankshaft. The crankshaft 47 drives a parallelogram type link arrangement 50 that includes a main link 51 with one end supported for guided movement in the frame 20 , a carrier arm 55 connected to one end of the main link 51 , a control arm 60 parallel to the main link 51 and connected at one end to the carrier arm 55 and at its other end to the crankshaft 47 , and an intermediate link 65 parallel to the carrier arm and connected between the main link and the control arm 60 . The inner end of the main link 51 is guided through a controlled path of travel whereby the spray head C mounted at the outer end of the carrier arm 55 is moved between a retracted position and an extended position located within the operating space.
