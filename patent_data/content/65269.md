# Switching device and circuit.

## Abstract
A switching device and circuit comprises a bi polar transistor 3, 3 and at least two field effect transistors 1, 2, 24, 30 for controlling the bi polar transistor. A first field effect transistor 1, 30 has its drain and source connected across the collector base of the bi polar transistor and a second field effect transistor 2, 24 has its drain and source connected across the base emitter of the bi polar transistor. Gates of the first and second field effect transistors are connected in common and applied with a voltage signal. The first field effect transistor 1, 30 is of an enhancement type and the second field effect transistor 2, 24 is of a depletion type.
