# Method of welding metal pipe sections with explosives.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for the explosive welding together of sections 2, 4 of large diameter metal pipe of the kind used in the construction of high volume oil and gas pipelines. In the method, internal 6 and external 7 band charges of welding explosive are simultaneously detonated adjacent to overlapped telescoped pipe ends. 1, 3 . The velocity of detonation of the initiating explosive is selected so that welding charges 6, 7 are simultaneously detonated around the pipes while maintaining the detonation fronts at superimposed locations and at a large angle to the pipe axis. This avoids unbalancing forces on the pipes and minimizes the collision of circumferential shock waves thus preventing pipe damage and imperfect welds.
