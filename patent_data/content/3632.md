# Carpet or carpet tiles and process for manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
An improved backing for carpet or carpet tiles is provided in which a bitumen is filled with a limestone type filler. Carpet and carpet tiles incorporating the filled bitumen 7 are cheaper to produce, less brittle and more fire resistant than conventional carpet or carpet tiles. Because of the nature of the filled bitumen 7 when in a fluid state, the process for manufacturing carpet or carpet tiles of the invention differs from conventional processes.
