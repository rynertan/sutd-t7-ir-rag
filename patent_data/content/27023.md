# Furyl intermediates of cardenolides, their synthesis and production of cardenolides and their isomers therefrom.

## Abstract
The invention relates to furyl intermediates useful in the preparation of synthetic cardenolides and their isomers, to the preparation thereof, and to the conversion of such intermedi ates into cardenolides. The process provides for the reaction of an unsaturated steroidal 17 ketone with an alkali or alkaline earth metal Î² furyl compound to produce an allylic alcohol which is subjected to acetylation and allylic rearrangement. The resulting material is then hydrogenated to produce the fur yl intermediate. Cardenolides are formed therefrom by oxida tion of the furyl intermediates.
