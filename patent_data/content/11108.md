# Electro optically matrix addressed electroluminescence display with memory and method for operating such a display.

## Abstract
It has been discovered for the practice of this disclosure that there is a threshold for switching with light an AC coupled electroluminescence EL device within the Î”V of the luminance voltage hysteresis loop thereof. Practice of this disclosure provides hybrid matrix addressing of an elec troluminescence display device 21 with memory through luminance voltage hysteresis by ANDING electrical and optical signals. It has particular utility for a large aspect ratio display, e.g., a single line display, i.e., one for which there is more information content in one direction than in another direction.
