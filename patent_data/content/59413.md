# Dispenser for flowable compositions.

## Abstract
The invention provides a cartridge for use in dispensing a crease setting composition into a temporary crease of a garment in order to make that crease permanent. The cartridge 17 is connected to a mechanism which by movement of the cartridge and mechanism relative to the crease causes the dispensing of the composition from a nozzle 34 at the end of the cartridge. The said end 26 of the cartridge 17 is of reinforced construction in order to support the nozzle 34 in a firm and effective manner. The nozzle is normally in the from of a tube 35 which fits in a bore 27 in said end 26 and the bore intersects the end of a cavity inside the cartridge which is conical in shape so as to give a small area 28 of intersection.
