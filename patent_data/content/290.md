# Rolling machine.

## Abstract
A rolling machine for reducing the cross sectional dimensions of an elongate workpiece, such as a steel billet, has pairs of alternately co operating planetary rolls 14 , each of which is journalled in an roll carrier 12 . Each carrier is rotated about a carrier axis 13 which is inclined at an angle of about 45 to the axis of rotation 15 of the roll journalled in the carrier. The carrier axes 13 of a universal planetary mill form the sides of a square around the pass line 28 which is normal to the plane in which the carrier axes 13 are located. As the carriers 12 rotate the pairs of co operating planetary rolls 14 alternately sweep over the workpiece and intermittently contact and reduce the workpiece in directions which are mutually at right angles. To avoid the formation of sharp edges to the rolled workpiece, either each roll 14 is collared to enclose a workpiece edge, or each carrier 12 additionally carries an edger roll which rounds that edge.
