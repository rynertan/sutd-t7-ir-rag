## Description
The present invention relates to new compositions provided with improved impact resistance, based on graft ed copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile onto polybutadiene it relates moreover to a particular method for the preparation of the same compositions. It is already known how to prepare plasto elastomeric compositions ABS polymers by means of the mixing of grafted polymeric products, in this case of polymers of styrene and acrylonitrile polymerized on polybutadiene rubbers, with thermoplastic resins constituted by styrene and acrylonitrile copolymers SAN resins . Such compositions display, as their particular char acteristic, high impact resistance combined with high hardness and ultimate tensile strength, and good thermal and flowability properties. For particular applications however these materials may display a quite unsuitable flowability impact strength balance, as well as the decrease of impact resistance to the low temperatures. As a consequence, in addition to the actual polymerization process, the production of ABS polymers involves a mixing step with additives capable to obviate or reduce the said drawbacks. The additives proposed to that purpose, having generally a lubricating action, are esters of monocarboxylic saturated aliphatic acids with polyvalent alcohols of high molecular weight U.S. Patent Nr. 4,174,325 , or com binations of silicone oils with calcium or pentaerythritol stearates U.S. Patent N. 4,248,778 , or siloxane urethanes European Patent Nr. 8,723 or finally, paraffinic or naphthenic or aromatic mineral oils with a particular viscosity value U.S. Patent Nr. 3,403,120 . The preparation of the blends of the polymeric components grafted polybutadiene rubber and SAN copolymers and of the above said additives is done, according to the techniques used up to date, by adding these latter to the coagulum of the latex of such polymeric components, or by the incorporation of the additives, effected on suitable blenders, inside the anhydrous pellets of the polymeric blend, or finally by admixing the polymer blend into the latex, then coaguating the latex. So, e.g., the already mentioned U.S. Patent Nr. 3,403,120 discloses the several methods for blending the polymeric components and the suitable additives, all such methods being within the above reported definitions. The end composition however shows always a percentage of mineral oil or of an equivalent additive greater than 3 by weight. Now, if the introduction of the oil into the blends constituted by the ABS polymers and by the SAN resins allows the above mentioned drawbacks to be overcome, the presence of tuo high, or however greater than certain values, amounts, can cause the arising in the end product of other drawbacks, such as their migration to the surface of the fabricated items, which causes the loss or the decrease of typical ABS characteristics such as e.g. the surface brightness, embrittlement in correspondence of the welding of the fluid flows difficulties of preparation of the blends by means of the industrial technologies traditionally applied. It has now been surprisingly found, that constitutes the main object of the present invention, that it is possible to improve to an unforeseeable extent the characteristics of flowability and of impact resistance of the compositions on the basis of ABS, without however im pairing the other valuable characteristics of the same polymers by means of the addition of mineral and or silicone oils to the polymeric blend in such amounts that the end composition does not contain percentages of the said additives also lower than 3 . A first object of the present invention are hence compositions on the basis of ABS provided with high impact resistance and flowability, comprising the following components A. from 5 to 97 by weight of a graft polymer obtained by means of the graft copolymerization of a. from 10 to 90 by weight of a mixture of acryloni trile and styrene, containing from 50 to 90 by weight of styrene b. from 90 to 10 by weight of polybutadiene B. from 10 to 90 by weight of c. a thermoplastic copolymer of acrylonitrile with styrene and or a methylstyrene, containing from 50 to 5 by weight of acrylonitrile, or d. a thermoplastic terpolymer of acrylonitrile with styrene and or a methylstyrene and a third monomer selected from methylmethacrylate and maleic anhy dride, containing from 50 to 5 by weight of acrylo nitrile and from 50 to 95 by weight of styrene and or a methylstyrene, or e. mixtures of copolymer c. with terpolymer d.C. from 0.1 to 3 of a mineral or silicone oil. As mineral oils, the paraffinic oils with straight or branched chain containing at least 20 carbon atoms may be used or the naphthenic or relatively naphthenic i.e., constituted at least prevailingly by saturated, monocyclic of from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and polycyclic of from 13 to 26 carbon atoms hydrocarbons oils or the aromatic oils having a minimum molecular weight around 300 may be used all these oils showing a minimum flash point in closed cup, according to ASTM D 93, of 1500C. As the silicone oils, those commercially known, e.g.from the dimethylsiloxane family, may be used. The above described compositions can be obtained by adding the above mentioned oils during the end stage of the grafting reaction, before the coagulation of the latex og the grafted polymer the migration to the interior of the polymer is in that case favoured by mixing the blend at a temperature of 40 C, and then coagulating the latex by means of the usual techniques. Such composition can be obtained as well according to one of the known methods which we have recalled in the introductory section of the present disclosure, e.g. with reference to the U.S. Patent Nr. 3,403,120, or by means of a method which allows a greater control of the introduced amount of mineral or silicone oil. This method, which constitutes a further object of the present invention, and which can be obviously applied also to the preparation of compositions containing additive percentages greater than 30 , foresees that the addition of the mineral or silicone oils, as above defined, be effected to the blend of polybutadiene, acrylonitrile and styrene during the grafting reaction of said monomers onto the poly butadiene, carried out according to an emulsion method. The addition of such oils may be done at the beginning of the reaction, or during the same reaction. The second object of the present invention is hence constituted by a method for obtaining ABS copolymers provided with improved characteristics of flowability and of mechanical strength, containing oil amounts of from 0.1 to 10 , comprising the steps of polymerization of mixtures of acrylonitrile and styrene in the presence of polybutadiene, with the formation of an acrylonitrile styrene copolymer grafted onto said polybutadiene, and of subsequent blending of such graft copolymer with copolymers on the basis of acrylonitrile and styrene, characterized in that such polymerization is carried out in an aqueous emulsion in the presence of from 0.1 to 50 by weight of a mineral oil and or of a silicone oil, relatively to the total weight of the end mixture of polymer grafted with the acrylonitrile styrene copolymer. Going now back to the definition of the constituents of the ABS based composition, first object of the present invention, the graft copolymer A can be prepared in a known way, by polymerizing the monomers styrene and acrylonitrile in an aqueous latex of polybutadiene in the weight percentages as defined above, in the presence of catalysts such as peroxides, hydroperoxides and so forth and of the usual amounts and types of emulsifiers, pH adjusters, etc. 3 The thermoplastic copolymer or terpolymer can be pre pared it too in a known way, by polymerizing the monomers in an aqueous emulsion, in suspension or in bulk, in the hereinabove defined mutual ratios, in the presence of the analogous amounts and types of catalysts, emulsifiers, etc., as used for preparing the graft polymer A. The polymerization temperature, for the preparation of both A and B copolymers, is selected according to the type of process used. According to the method of the present invention, as hereinabove disclosed, the mineral and or silicone oil is added to the mixture of polybutadiene and monomers during the preparation of the graft polymer A. The invention is now illustrated by the followingExamples, to which however it is not be intended as being limited. Example 1 6253 Grams of a latex containing 34 by weight of po lybutadiene, with an average size of the particles of from 1000 to 8000 are charged inside a reactor together with a mixture formed by 2305 g of styrene and 874 g of acrylonitrile. To it 265 g are then added of a prevailing ly paraffinic oil, of Engler viscosity at 500C of 23.8 and the catalyst, constituted by 5.3 g of cumene hydroper oxide, 3.89 g of activator iron EDTA , 7.3 g of Rhodite. The mixture is then allowed to react for 5 hours and 45 minutes at 700 C. The so obtained polymer is coagulated with a 35 CaCl2 solution, is separated, washed and dried at 70 800 C. The dried product is then blended in a Banbury type blender with different amounts of a thermoplastic styrene acrylonitrile SAN copolymer, with a weight ratio of the two monomers of 71 29, a series being obtained of five products characterized by the following weight contents Graft polybuta SAN Copolymer Paraffinic diene, oil, 1st Product 23.82 75 1.18 2nd Product 35.72 62.5 1.78 3rd Product 47.63 50 2.37 4th Product 22.75 75 2.25 5th Product 30.23 66.78 2.99 Examples 2 4 The process is carried out in an analogous way to that ofExample 1, with the difference that in place of the paraffinic oil similar amounts of a naphthenic oil having anEngler viscosity at 500C of 18.3, of an aromatic oil having an Engler viscosity at 500C of 2.75, and of a silicone oil having an Engler viscosity at 500C of 11.4 are respectively used, for each oil five end products being obtained of composition analogous to that of those of Example 1.
