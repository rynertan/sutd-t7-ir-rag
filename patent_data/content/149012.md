# TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM INCLUDING VEHICLE SPEED RESPONSIVE ORIFICE VALVE WHICH MODIFIES FRICTION ELEMENT ENGAGEMENT RATE

## Abstract
In order to reduce the rate at which a friction element is engaged during a downshift in a multi forward speed automatic automotive transmission, an orifice valve is arranged to be responsive to a vehicle speed signal e.g. governor pressure in a manner to permit fluid communica tion between a shift valve and the friction element via two flow restrictions when the vehicle speed is below a predeter mined level and restrict the communication to a single flow restriction when the vehicle speed exceeds said level.
