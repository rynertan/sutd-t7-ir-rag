# LOW NOISE DIGITAL SEISMIC STREAMER AND METHOD OF MARINE SEISMIC EXPLORATION

## Abstract
A streamer for towing behind a marine vessel engaged in seismic exploration comprises a plurality of substantially identical modules connected serially to one another, each comprising plural hydrophone means 36 for detecting reflected acoustic waves, and outputting analog electronic signals in response thereto digitizing means 42 for convert ing said analog signals to digital representations thereof and means for transmission of said digital representations along conductor means 58 comprised in said modules up said streamer to said vessel for recording.
