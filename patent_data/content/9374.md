## Abstract
A hollow filament separatory module 20 comprises a tube 22 wound from layers 23 to 25 of hollow semi permeable filaments. Each layer is formed from a helical winding and the filament of each layer has a predetermined length within plus or minus 10 . One end of the annulus is encapsulated in potting compound 66 and the com pound is sliced through to expose open ends of the fila ments in each layer. The tube 22 is enclosed in a pressure casing 32, 34, 36, 38 having a fluid inlet 44 at one end and two outlets 50, 52 at the other end. The outlet 50 communicates with the open ends of the filaments and fluid which permeates through the filaments flows from it. The outlet 52 communicates with the outsides of the filments and fluid which does not enter the tubes flows from it. The outlets 50 and 52 are separated by sealing rings 58 and 60 , which form seals between the periphery of the potting compound 66 and the inside face of the casing part 34 .

## Description
HOLLOW FILAMENT SEPARATORY MODULES AND METHODS OF MAKING SUCH MODULES The use of permeable or semi permeable membranes to effect separation of gas gas, liquid liquid, and liquid solid mixtures and solutions has achieved general industrial applicability. In general, membranes are contained in vessels called modules, comprising a container having various inlet and outlet ports and an assembly of membranes within said container. The internal configurations of the membranes and of the vessel are so arranged as to permit the introduction of a feed stream with or without pressure on the upstream faces of the membranes and to include means for collecting permeate which passes through the membranes and emerges on their downstream faces, and means are provided for keeping feed and permeate materials from commingling. Membranes have been fabricated in the form of open ended hollow tubular filaments so arranged and sealed into header plates as to provide a separation of the flow over the external surfaces of the hollow filaments from the flows within the bores of the hollow filaments. This invention relates to hollow filament separatory modules and methods of fabricating the same which include features enabling the maximization of use ofthe attributes of the hollow filaments for the separation. According to one aspect of the present invention, a hollow filament separtory module comprises an annulus of hollow filaments consisting of a plurality of wound layers of semi permeable hollow filaments with each of said layers being formed by a helical winding with adjacent layers wound to opposite hands and the length of filament in each layer being within ten percent of a predetermined length, the filaments having open ends and main portions, means for isolating the open ends from the main portions, first flow means for causing fluid to flow in contact with the outer surfaces of the filaments at the main portions thereof and second flow means for causing fluid which has permeated through the walls of the filaments to flow within the hollow filaments and through the open ends thereof. The invention also consists, according to another of its aspects, in a method of making such a module comprising preparing the annulus by winding a plurality of layers of hollow filament, one on top of the other, at predetermined limits for the specific ratio of rotational velocity and axial speed of winding so that the helical windings are laid at selected radial positions in the annulus varying in length within predetermined limits. The filaments or fibres may be used of diameters consistent with the flow requirements of high flux membranes. For example, it is possible to use filaments or fibres with diameters of as little as 100 microns or as much as 500 microns or more. The specific dimensions of length and diameter of the fibres can be very important, depending upon the intended use of the module.The present invention allows for easy selection of these dimensions. In reverse osmosis applications, we prefer fibres of at least about 250 microns in diameter.Additionally, by winding the fibres in a helical fashion with adjacent layers wound to opposite hands there is provided more uniform distribution of the channel spaces and surfaces of the fibres usable for separation. Thus, while conventional constructions have used 50 100 microns as the typical range of outside diameter for the hollow fine fibre membranes, we prefer the hollow fibres to have diameters of 250 microns or more. Indeed, in some cases we have made very successful use of fibres of over 500 microns in outside diameter. In this approach to the utilisation of fibres of large and controlled ranges of diameter, we have used as a preferred embodiment a composite hollow fibre comprising a porous substrate, overcoated with a selected high filtration rejection barrier. The module of this invention overcomes serious deficiencies in prior hollow fine fibre module constructions. One of these deficiencies which has been overcome by preferred features of the invention relates to methods of potting the fibres into sealing tube sheets or end plates, and subsequently opening the end of the fibres to provide exits from the individual fibre bores into a permeate collection chamber. A preferred embodiment of the invention has the advantages firstly that the module internal pressure acting against the filament potting compound is resisted by a surface of the potting compound in which no cut filament or fibre ends appear. Secondly, the surface of the potting compound which supports the thrust developed by the internal hydraulic pressure is generally at right angles to the principal axis of the module i.e. generally parallel to the surface of the potting compound which faces inwards towards the pressurised region of the module . Thirdly, cut ends of fibres which form outlets for the permeate flow are located in access surfaces within the potting compound at a different elevation from and or at an angle to the surface of the potting compound required to take the pressure thrust. Another preferred feature which can be provided when the cut fibre ends are in access surfaces is that the sum of the areas of the projections of the access surfaces that is the surfaces containing the fibre ends, on a plane at right angles to the direction of thrust of the pressurisation forces acting on the potting compound may be made substantially less than 50 of the cross sectional area of any plane parallel thereto within the potting compound. This provision results in very little decrease in the compressive strength of the potting compound. Another preferred feature of the present invention concerns the sealing of the pressurised concentrate regions of the module separate from the permeate collection regions of the module. Another preferred feature of this invention solves problems present in conventional modules regarding the pressure losses associated with bore flow within the hollow filaments or fibres. It has been demonstrated that with inherently high flux membrane capabilities unless due account is taken of fibre length and bore diameter, adverse results will occur. The results are an increase in salt passage through the membranes formed by the fibre walls and a decrease in the effective use of surface of the fibre in respect to the normal zero length flux. In effect, both flux and rejection are diminished with fibres too long relative to their bore size and inherent permeation rate. It should be noted that it is possible to use hollow fibres in reverse osmosis either with the bore open at one end and sealed at the other, or with the bore open at both ends. In the former case, the open fibre end is sealed in a mass of potting compound and its bore discharges into a low pressure permeate collection chamber. The closed end may be potted into a resin mass or the like to help support one end of the bundle of which the fibre forms a part. When both bore ends are open in each fibre length, both ends of the fibre must be sealed in a potting compound in such a way that the bore discharge exits into low pressure permeate collection chambers at both ends.The two ends of any one fibre may be located in the same mass of potting compound, the fibre being formed in a loop and each bore exit may then discharge to the same collection chamber. Alternatively, the fibres may be potted in such a way that both open bore ends discharge into separate collection chambers. When both open ends are located in the same mass of potting compound and both bore open ends discharge into the same collection chamber, the length of fibre between the cut ends is in the form of a loop, as already mentioned. The loop may be of simple fairly straight legged hairpin shape, or it may follow a more intricate spatial path in two or three dimensions,However, if each fibre end is potted in separate masses of potting compound the fibre shape between the cut ends could possible be straight or could follow an infinite variety of either random or geometrically arranged paths.We generally prefer to arrange the fibres in helical paths, the axes thereof being congruent and parallel to the principal direction of flow of the pressurised feed. For purposes of considering the examples illustrating the adverse effect of fibre length on bore flow effects, the actual path shape of each fibre need not be considered. It is important however to take numerical account of the consequence of operating with one sealed end versus both ends open. In the sealed end case, the flow within the fibre bore can only be from the sealed end toward the open end. The the two end open case, flow within the fibre bore is bi directional with respect to some point or zone along the fibre path. That is to say, there must be a stagnation point or region in the bore corresponding to the sealed end of the one endopen case bore flow on one side of said point or zone will be towards the bore exit at one cut end, while bore flow on the other side of said zone will be towards the bore exit at the other cut end.Thus, a position approximately half way along the path between the ends of a two end open fibre corresponds to the sealed end of a one end open fibre. Reference is made herein to a length, L, as the path length between the cut ends of double open ended fibre.It should be borne in mind that for single open end cases the fibre length from cut to open end ordinarily corresponds to one half of a length associated with a two end open case. The corresponding set of fibre properties and module operating conditions will result in limits on length from cut end to sealed end essentially one half that allowable for the path length between the ends of a two open end configuration. We prefer to employ in our module fibres with both ends open. We have found that there is a unique relationship between various geometric and hydraulic features of the module and its operation that must be met to achieve superior results in module productivity and the rejection qualities of the permeate. Preferably therefore, the path length between the open ends of each fibre must not exceed a certain value, LCrit in cm. which depends upon the variables fibre outside diameter, fibre inside diameter, effective driving pressure, and fibre inherent flux at said pressure.According to our construction, we limit the length of the path between the cut open ends according to the following equation EMI6.1 Where P Module inlet feed pressure in Kg cm2 A X Osmotic pressure difference between feed solution and peremate in Kg cm2 ID Filament internal diameter in microns R Ratio of filament inside diameter to outside diameter F Flux of filament based on its outside diameter at the effective operating pressure, expressed as a velocity of microns per second. The operation of thisrelationshipwill be illustrated in several following examples. In each instance a group of filaments or fibres was formed into a loop, and the legs of the loop of fibres were sealed in a potting compound and open ends of fibre were exposed all on one side of said compound. The lengths of fibre loop on the opposite side of the compound were mounted inside pressure tubing and subject to flowing feed of salt solution under pressure.The length of loop, L, was taken as the overall distance from one cut end to the other cut end of the fibre, substantially all of said length being within the pressurised feed zone, and a relatively inconsequential amount comprising the length of fibre in the potting compound. A slight correction may be made for the so called inactive length of fibre sealed in the potting compound. It will be recognised by one familiar with the art, however, that this length represents a small fraction of the active length of fibre. Correction for the portion of inactive length is quantitatively unimportant when the ratio inactive length active length is about 0.1 or less for all practical cases this requirement is easily met. All the fibres employed in the examples below were a composite of po1ysu phone substrate with a rejection barrier of sulphonated polyfuran resin. The outside diameters were all 250 microns and inside diameters 80 microns within tolerances of a 5 microns . The several samples were selected to cover a fairly wide range of flux and rejection properties. Each sample was prepared with different end to end lengths. Each sample was tested for permeate flux and rejection of 2000 ppm NaC1 solution at 58 Kg cmÃª applied pressure down to as low as 14.5 Kg cm2 applied pressure 200 psi . The osmotic pressure t of the feed is taken as 1.4 Kg cm2. The flux and rejection of each fibre sample were measured at each of three fibre lengths and comprise the experimental data appearing in Tables 1A and 1B.Flux was plotted vs. length as shown in the graphs forming Figures 18 and 19 of the accompanying drawings.Fairly reliable extrapolations to zero length flux were made on these plots and are included in parentheses in the tabulated property values shown in Tables 1A and 1B. Included also in the Table are the values ofLcrit calculated by use of Equation l for each fibre sample and operating pressure. Using these several calculated values of L crit the ratio of L LC for each sample length was calculated and are also presented in the Table. Rejection is calculated in the conventional fashion, R 100 1 salt conc. permeate salt conc. feed . Flux is presented both as gallons per sq. ft. per day gfd and the velocity parameter, microns per second micron sec . These are related by 1 gfd 0.466 micron sec. The ratio of flux at any given length to zero length flux, F Fo, is also tabulated. TABLE I.Flux and Rejection vs. Fibre lengthEMI9.1 tb A.

The points are clearly distributed in such a way that the graph can be partitioned into four quadrants by a vertical line corresponding to L LC 1 and a horizontal line corresponding to F Fo .88.At values of L less than Lc, the flux is 87.5 of the zero length flux or greater for all but 1 of 15 points at values of L greater than Lc, the observed flux is 8350 of the zero length flux or less for 7 of 8 points. When L is as great as 2 to 3 times Lc, the experienced flux can fall to as little as 40 50 of the zero length flux. The effect of length on rejection shown in Table 1, is also represented in Fig. 21 for several of the samples. For this plot, the value Salt Passage is used and found from Salt Passage 100 Rejection . The Salt Passage is plotted against the ratio L L c in the graph which formes Figure 21 of the accompanying drawings. It will be seen that as L increases toward Lc, Salt Passage rises only a few tenths of a per cent, but at L LC 1, Salt Passage starts to rise fairly rapidly. It will be seen, therefore, that the critical endto end length, Lc ,.calculated through the Equation set forth above can be used as a practical criterion for preserving both a high percentage of zerdLlength flux and the superior salt rejection properties attendant therewith. In a corollary sense, constructing modules with fibres of end to end length greater than Lc, should be avoided, since there is both a fairly significant loss of permeate production efficiency as well as a degradation in permeate quality than can become intolerable. The exact value of Lc does not, however, always determine an absolute boundary of acceptable performance.It might well be that zero length flux and rejection values are so favourable that a flux efficiency of somewhat less than .85 could be tolerated along with a few percent increase of salt passage. In recognition of this, we use limits of 10 around Lc for practical module fabtication. In the preferred method of preparing fibre bundles according to the present invention, the hollow fibres are wound continuously in alternating helices starting on a small diameter shaft or mandrel, building an annular bundle. The path length of fibre forming a helix from one end of the bundle to the other is a function of the radial position of the fibre in the annulus and its helix angle. Therefore, unless appropriate adjustments are made in the relative speed of rotation of the winding shaft and the end to end traverse speed of the bundle of filaments during the winding, there will be a continuously increasing length of fibre in any pass between the two ends of the bundle as the radial position increases. The changes can result in as much as a several fold increase in the length of tbe helix or more. Perhaps in some conditions as much as 6 to 10fold.Thus, if the length of helical loop from one end to the other has been determined for optimum flux and rejection, and the initial winding on the mandrel were to accomplish that optimum length, the external wraps in the annulus would be far in excess of the desired length. By selecting precalculated limits for the specific ratio of the rotational velocity of the the winding mandrel and the reciprocating traverse mechanism, helices can be laid at selected radial positions in the annulus varying very slightly in respect to thei r length. For example, a helix length from the innermost to the outermost regions of the annulus never varying more than 10 above or below the optimum length can be achieved. One might assume that this condition could be achieved by having a continuously decaying ratio of the rotational velocity of the mandrel to the traverse speed. But this leads to other problems obviated by our invention. It can be shown that at selected ratios of the rotational and traverse speeds the helix winds will build explicitly on top of one another thereby forming ridges. These ratios are unavoidable in any monotomically declining scheme. The result of the ridges is to build an annular package of helices having hills and valleys which are never properly filled as winding proceeds. In our method, we avoid this problem by selecting a series of discrete ratios of the winding and traverse rates and changing from one ratio to the next during the winding at predetermined annular positions. It is another feature of our invention that the annular bundle of helixes is self supporting. Whereas the prior art describes in some instances helical bundles, these. are generally firmly and permanently associated with the winding shaft or tube originally comprising the mandrel surface. Contrary to that, we have found superior results in both the winding and subsequent handling of the fibre bundle preparatory to potting and the like, by use of a collapsible expansible sleeve as the surface immediately upon which the first wraps of the bundle are wound. This sleeve may be a braided tube of yarn, for example. Said sleeve is secured over the winding shaft for a distance greater than the axial length of the annulus for support of the inner surface of the annulus.An additional length of the expansible sleeve sufficient to provide a continuous protective surface for the external fibres of the annulus, rolled around one end of the annulus, is also carried on the winding shaft. Another feature of our invention relates to the method of encapsulating one end of the annulus in what has been referred to as the potting compound. The invention will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of one example of a hollow filament separatory module in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a partially sectional longitudinal view of the module shown in Figure 1 taken along the line 2 2 in the direction of the arrows therein Figures 3, 4 and 5 are transverse sectional views taken respectively along the lines 3 3, 4 4 and 5 5 in the direction of the arrows in Figure 2 Figure 6 is an exploded perspective view of a cylindrical winding support shaft and collapsible expansible sleeve about which hollow filaments are wound during the fabrication of the fibre bundle of the module shown in Figure 1 Figure 7 is a perspective view of the support shaft with the sleeve in position thereon prior to winding lii Figure 8 is a perspective view of the support shaft and sleeve with the fibre helix being wound thereon to provide the fibre bundle Figure 9 is a perspective view illustrating the removal of the support shaft and stretching and folding of the sleeve after completion of the winding of the bundle Figures 10, 11 and 12 are partially diagrammatic longitudinal segmentary views illustrating the winding respectively of the first, an intermediate and the final or outer wrap in the annular fibre bundle Figure 13 is a diagrammatic view of inner, outer and intermediate wraps forming the bundle illustrating the location in each of these wraps where the fibre of the respective wrap crosses the fibre of the previous wrap or layer in the completed bundle Figure 14 is a perspective view illustrating the relative positions of the annular bundle, and the collapsible and expansible sleeve in the completed bundle Figure 15 is a partially sectional longitudinal view of the completed bundle positioned in a mould during the potting operation wherein an end of the annular bundle of fibres is encapsulated Figure 16 is a partially sectional view of another embodiment of the invention wherein the fibre access surface planes in the potting compound are obtained in a different manner Figure 17 is a partially sectional view wherein still another method of obtaining fibre access surface planes is shown and, Figures 18 to 21 are graphs previously referred to. A module constructed in accordance with this invention is designated in the drawings, generally by the numeral 20. The module in completed form is seen in Figures 1 to 5 and includes an annulus 22 formed of wound permeable hollow filaments and braid sleeve 26 folded over to sandwich the filaments for the most part between inner and outer sleeve sections 26a and 26b with solid rod 28 projecting within and occupying annulus core 30. The specific manner in which the annulus is wound is described in detail below. The fibres which are of relatively large diameter are wound in helical fashion with adjacent layers wound in opposite hand.There is relatively uniform distribution of the large diameter fibres and the channel spaces and surfaces of the fibres usable for separation. In the preferred embodiment the hollow fibres are 250 microns or greater in outside diameter. In certain applications 500 microns outside diameter is preferred. Although any suitable hollow fibre can be used, the preferred embodiment contemplates a composite hollow fibre comprising a porous substrate, overcoated with a selected high filtration rejection barrier. The annulus 22 is encased within pressure resistant shell 32 and pressure sleeve 34 between end plates 36 and 38 held in position by stringers 40 passing through holes 42 formed in the end plates. Axial feed in port 44 is provided in end plate 36 to allow the fluid which is being operated upon to wash the outside of the fibres 22 after passing through prefilter 46 and perforated disc 48. In certain applications either or both prefilter 46 and disc 48 can be omitted. In the preferred embodiment prefilter 46 is a felt structure through which the liquid can pass and disc 48 is a rigid plastic member. The pressure sleeve 34 is provided with radial ports 50 and 52 which respectively provide outlets for permeate and concentrate. Port 4 functions as a weep hole. Suitable O rings 56, 58, 60, 62 and 64 are provided. The end of the annulus 22 within pressure sleeve 34 is encased in potting compound 66 as will be described below. The manner of winding annulus 22 is seen in Figures 6 through 14. Collapsible expansible braided sleeve 26 is secured over suitable winding shaft 68 for a distance greater than the axial length of the annulus to support the inner surface of the annulus. This is the surface immediately upon which the first wraps of the bundle 22 are wound. An additional length of expansible sleeve sufficient to provide a continuous protective surface for the external surface of the annulus, rolled around one end of the annulus, is provided. In the preferred method of preparing fibre bundles according to the present invention, the hollow fibres are wound continuously in alternating helices starting on a small diameter shaft, building an annular bundle. As stated above, the path length of fibre forming a helix from one end of the bundle to the other is a function of the radial position of the fibre in the annulus and its helix angle. Therefore, unless appropriate adjustments are made in the relative speed of rotation of the winding shaft and the end to end traverse speed of the bundle of filaments during the winding, there will be a continuously increasing length of fibre in any pass between the two ends of the bundle as the radial position increases.We select pre calculated limits for the specific ratio of the rotational velocity of the winding mandrel and the reciprocating traverse mechanism, and lay down helices at selected radial positions in the annulus varying very slightly in respect to their length. For example, a helix length from the innermost to the outermost regions of the annulus never varying more than 10 around the optimum length is preferred and readily achieved. A series of discrete ratios of the winding and traverse rates is selected and changed from one ratio to the next during the winding at predetermined annular positions thus avoiding the building up of hills and valleys. In the Figures the first layer of helical winding by way of example is indicated by the numeral 23, a second by the numeral 24 and a third by the numeral 25, there being adjacent intermediate unindicated windings wound in opposite hand. This solves problems present in conventional modules regarding the pressure losses associated with bore flow within a hollow fibre and takes into account fibre length and bore diameter. This avoids an increase in percent salt passage and a decrease in the effective use of surface of the fibre in respect to the nominal zero length flux and flux and rejection are not diminished because fibres are too long relative to their bore size and inherent permeation rate. Upon completion of the winding operation the outer end 26b of the braid is wrapped over the annulus 22 with the inner end 26a of the braid left within and the mandrel 68 removed exposing bore 30. After winding, one end of annulus 22 is encapsulated in potting compound 66. The art of casting fibrous and other materials into a common matrix is well known and referred to as potting . It is also well known to select potting compounds of which epoxies are but one example, so that their compatibility with fibres or other materials to be encapsulated makes for intimate bonding in the interfaces between the fibres or particles, and the encapsulating compound. Thus, in the case of hollow fibres to be sealed in the potting compound 66 it would be most desirable that the fibre surfaces be wet well by the potting compound in its prepolymerised fluid form.As a natural consequenoe of good wettability of the fibres by the potting compound before it is cured, there will be a tendency for the potting compound in its precured state to migrate by capillarity among the fibres, perhaps to considerable distance beyond the position where it would be useful for the cured potting compound to be. In the potting this would lead to occlusion and loss of membrane surface of some of the fibre, possible pockets of unsealed regions, and unnecessary utilisation of epoxy compound. In the subject invention a ring of rubbery cement as indicated in Figure 15 by the numeral 70 is applied to the extensible sleeve member on the winding shaft 68 during the winding operation at a position that will correspond ultimately to the upper regions 72 of the potting compound 66 when it is later placed in mould 74 as shown in Figure 5. Then during the winding of the fibres on first the extensible sleeve and subsequently on top of the preceeding fibre wraps as shown in Figures 10 13, a continuous deposit of the same rubbery cement is made at generally the same axial position in the annulus.At the completion of the winding of the entire annulus, there exits with it a substantially doughnut or O ring barrier membrane of the rubbery cement in the plane generally designated by numeral 70 in Figure 15, separating the portion of the fibres which will ultimately become imbedded in the potting compound from the remainder of their lengths. In the same sense, the end of inner extensible sleeve member 26a also has the barrier membrane, applied thereto, so that if it too has a capability for inducing capillary migration of the precured potting compound, said capillarity would be obstructed at the same axial point of position. The completion of the potting operation after winding is illustrated in Figure 15 with the mould and potting compound designated respectively by the numerals 74 and 66. The uncured potting compound 66 in mould 74 is subject to vibration from subsonic to ultrasonic frequencies by a suitable impulsing device, such as a vibrating hammer or ultrasonic transducer, not shown. The fibre bundle 22 is immersed into the mould 74 containing the precured potting compound 66 which, under the urging of the vibratory energy supplied to the mould, tends to migrate within and fill the interstices of the bundle with much greater ease than would have been secured by gravity alone. After potting the fibres of the annulus must be opened so that permeate within the individual bores thereof can be received and collected in the collection chamber or annular gallery 71 provided in the mould potting compound, for removal through port 50. A feature of the subject invention is to provide that the internal pressure force developed in the module during use and acting against the fibre potting compound 66 is resisted by a surface of the potting 66 in which no fibres end. The numeral 67 in Figure 2 designates this surface. Additionally the surface 67 of the potting supports the thrust developed by the internal hydraulic pressure acting against the inwardly facing surface of the potting. In the subject invention ends of fibres which are cut or exposed to provide exit for the permeate flow are in access surfaces within the potting Compound at either a different elevation or a different angle than the surface of the potting compound required to take the pressurising thrust force, or both. We have found that if a number of angular slices are made into the end of the cylinder of fibre containing potting, connecting points near the centre of surface 69, upwardly and outwardly with points in the surface 71 of the annular gallery of the potting providing continuous channels connecting surfaces 69 and 71 and providing an apex in the slice along 78 as seen in the Figures, all fibres will have open ends exposed to gallery 76. As seen in Figure 3, the three v shaped slices comprise six access surfaces, 79, lying at an oblique angle to the base of the potting compound. These access surface planes resulting from the cutting communicate with the annular gallery within the low pressure region of the assembled module, providing thereby ready access to the permeate collection system.The creation of the planes by cutting of the potting compound is accomplished in the preferred embodiment at a time in the curing cycle of the potting compound prior to its final cure. By the selection of a potting compound and control of the time and temperature after immersion of the fibre bundle in the mould, the potting compound achieves a state in which it is readily cut without creation of unwanted detritus to block the fibre openings yet of sufficient resilient integrity to slice cleanly by means of a sharp edged blade. After cutting, cure of the potting compound is completed by heat and or the passage of time. An alternate embodiment of the invention directed toward the creation of cut fibre ends in an access surface plane of the potting compound is shown in Figure 16. In this example, the fibre helix bundle is wound in such a way that at one end the helix wrapping takes a continuously increasingly steeper angle, forming a conical taper inner surface over a distance indicated by the bracketed length marked 80 in Figurel6. When this conically tapered end of the annular array of fibres is potted in a mould, it is mounted along with a stepped plug 81, in such a way that the potting compound encapsulates concurrently the end of the fibre bundle and the plug. After curing, a narrow annular access surface, 79, is machined into the potting compound at an elevation above the support surface provided by the plug. Still another embodiment of our invention is illustrated by Figure 17. Here, a wound bundle of filaments is prepared having loops at one end extending at right angles to the main axis of the bundle. This can be accomplished, for example, by mounting on the winding mandrel a thin, disclike member several inches larger in diameter than the mandrel. During the winding operation, the traverse of the yarn is carried axially beyond said disc so that there is a section of yarn from each loop of the wind that passes over theextreme edge of the disc before the yarn direction is reversed. The result of such a winding process is to provide at one end of the helically wound bundle a flange like circular array of fibres whose axes at that point lie generally at right angles to the annulus axis.Later, the entire flange like circular array of fibres plus an additional region axially inward of said array become the site for the infusion of potting compound. The mould for such an assemblage provides means for creating segments in the potting compound with fibres of the flange like bundle extension lying in said segments of potting compound. After the full cure of said potting compound, it is possible to create open fibre ends in the fibre lengths lying at right angles to the main axis of the annulus by shearing off the segmented zones of potting compound in which the flange like array of fibres has been embedded.Thus an access plane 79, will be created where each such segmented zone of potting compound has been fractured from the body of the pot. Open ends of fibres will again be found in planes lying at some angle, generally at a right angle, to the surface against which the thrust on the potting compound is applied during module operation. Another feature of the subject invention concerns the sealing of the pressurised concentrate regions of the module separate from the permeate collection regions of the module. In the subject invention the permeate colistion chamber 75 is sealed apart from the pressurised concentrate region of the potting compound by O rings 56 and 58 with weephole 54 additionally protected byO ring seal 60 to allow any leak of concentrate to exit the module assembly without inadvertently commingling with the permeate. The pressurised concentrate is removed at port 52 which is sealed byO rings 60 and 62. Although the O rings are hidden during operation of the module, any leakage past them can readily be detected and corrective action taken. The O rings 58 and 60 define an intermediate zone between the collection zone containing the collection chamber 71 and the pressurised zone which is surrounded by the pressure resistant shell 32. In the prior art modules the pressure shell has been a cylindrical chamber in view of the accepted manner of resisting the high hydrostatic pressures. The requirement has been imposed on the shell to accept both the hoop stress loadings and axial loading developed by connections to the end plates. In addition, the end plates were frequently mounted to the shell and connected by snap rings or the like, which carried the thrust on the end plates to shell surface through grooves or some other connective ridges or the like. This required that the shell be of substantial thickness and mechanical integrity in all directions. In the subject invention the stringer bolts 40 secure the two end plates 36 and 38 of the pressure cylinder to one another, thereby eliminating axial stress on the shell,By use of these stress bearing stringer members, problems associated with connecting end plates to the shell by snap rings and the like are also eliminated. These features allow for simpler fabrication of the shell itself and the assembly and disassembly of the entire system, as well as access to its internal parts. Thus, among others the aforementioned objects are achieved.
