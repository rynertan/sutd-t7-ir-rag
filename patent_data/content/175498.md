## Abstract
A tripeptide has the formula A B C wherein A is pGlu, D pGlu, or N AcSar B is Phe, D Phe, Tyr, β Nal, D β Nal, p Cl Phe, or D p Phe and C is Gly or NHR, wherein R is a lower alkyl group or a pharmaceutically accept able salt thereof, provided that, when A is pGlu, B cannot be Phe. Medical use. e.g. in the treatment of gastric hypersecre tion, is disclosed. To prepare the tripeptide, a resin of C and a blocking group, and a resin of B and a blocking group are first prepared. The C containing resin and the B containing resin are reacted to form a reaction product. The reaction product is reacted with an A containing resin to form a further reaction product which is treated to yield the tripeptide A B C.

## Description
Peptides, their use in Medicine and Methods for their Preparation This invention relates to peptides, their use in medicine, and methods for their preparation. The reader is referred to Schally et al, U.S.Pat. No. 4,328,134, the disclosure of which is to be regarded as incorporated herein by reference for a description of tripeptides said to exhibit anorexigenic properties and to inhibit gastric hypersecretion. The invention features, in one aspect thereof, a tripeptide having the formula A B C wherein A is pGlu, D pGlu, or N AcSar B is Phe, D Phe,Tyr, ss Nal, D ss Nal, p Cl Phe, or D p Cl Phe and C isGly or NHR, wherein R is a lower 6 or fewer carbon atoms alkyl group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, provided that, when A is pGlu, B cannot be Phe. When neither the D or L designation is given, the L isomer is intended. In preferred embodiments, the tripeptide is pGlu D Phe Gly N AcSar Phe Gly pGlu Tyr Gly pGlu ss Nal Gly pGlu p Cl Phe Gly pGlu D ss Nal Gly or pGlu D p Cl Phe Gly or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In other preferred embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, e.g., magnesium carbonate or lactose, form a therapeutic composition, e.g., a pill, tablet, capsule, or liquid for oral administration to a patient a liquid capable of being administered nasally to a patient or a liquid capable of being administered intravenously, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally. We have found examples of tripeptides in accordance with the invention to be effective in inhibiting gastric hypersecretion and associated physiological disorders, e.g., gastric, peptic, or duodenal ulcers. They also exhibit a long duration of activity, thus requiring lower effective dosages. The invention provides, in a second and alternative aspect thereof, a method of making a tripeptide having the formula A B C wherein A is pGlu, D pGlu, or N AcSar B is Phe, D Phe, Tyr, ss Nal, D ss Nal, p Cl Phe, or D p Cl Phe and C is Gly orNHR, wherein R is a lower alkyl group, provided that, whenA is pGlu, B cannot be Phe said method comprising a preparing a resin of C and a blocking group b preparing a resin of B and a blocking group c reacting said C containing resin and saidB containing to form a reaction product d reacting an A containing resin with said reaction product to form a further reaction product and e treating said further reaction product to yield a tripeptide of formula A B C. We now describe the structure, synthesis, and use of preferred embodiments of the invention.Structure The tripeptides have the general formula A B C defined above. They can also be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of preferred salts are those with therapeutically acceptable organic acids, e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, salicyclic, methanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, or pamoic acid, as well as polymeric acids such as tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose, and salts with inorganic acids such as the hydrohalic acids, e.g, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, or phosphoric acid.Synthesis The synthesis of specific tripeptides follows byWay of example. Other tripeptides within the scope of this invention can be prepared by making appropriate modifications of the following synthetic method. pGlu D Phe Gly The first step is the preparation of pyroglutamic acid D phenylalanine glycine resin, as follows. Alpha t butoxycarbonyl Boc glycine is esterified to commercially available chloromethylated polystyrene resin 1 cross linked with divinylbenzene to give a Boc Gly resin with an incorporation of 0.72 mmole of Gly per gram. This resin 1.38g, 1.0 mmole is placed in the reaction vessel of a Beckman 990B peptide synthesizer programmed to perform the following reaction cycle a CH2C12 b 33 trifluoroacetic acid inCH2C12 2 times for 1 and 25 min each c CH2C12 d ethanol e CH2Cl2 f 10t triethylamine in CHCl3 g CH2Cl2. F The neutralized resin is stirred withBoc D phenylalanine and diisopropylcarbodiimide 3.0 mmole in CH2C12 for 1 hour, and the resulting amino acid resin is then cycled through steps a to g in the above wash program. Pyroglutamic acid 3.0 mmole is then coupled by the same procedure. After washing and drying, the completed resin weighs 1.46g. The completed pyroglutamic acid D phenylalanine glycine resin is mixed with anisole 4my dithiothreitol loom , and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 36ml at OOC and stirred for 45 minutes.Excess hydrogen fluoride is evaporated rapidly under a stream of dry nitrogen and free peptide precipitated and washed with ether. The crude peptide is then dissolved in a minimum volume of 2M acetic acid and eluted on a column 2.5 X lOOmm of Sephadex G 25 in the same solvent. Fractions containing a major component, as determined by uv absorption and thin layer chromatography tlc , are then pooled, evaporated to a small volume and applied to a column 1.5 X 150cm of silica gel, which is eluted with l butanol acetic acid water ethyl acetate 1 1 1 1 by volume . Fractions are examined by tlc and analytical high performance liquid chromatography hplc , and pooled to give maximum purity. Repeated lyophilization of the solution from dilute acetic acid gives 145mg of the product as a fluffy white powder. This material is found to be homogeneous by hplc and tlc. Amino acid analysis of antacid hydrolysate confirms the composition of the tripeptide. N AeSar Phe Gly, pGlu Tyr Gly, pGlu 3 Nal Gly, pGlu p Cl Phe Gly, pGlu D ss Nal Gly, and pGlu D p Cl Phe Gly are prepared in similar yields in an analogous fashion by appropriately modifying the above procedure. For example, to make N AcSar Phe Gly, the resin is prepared a above substituting Boc sarcosine for the last amino acid, followed by removal of the Boc group and subsequent acetylation of the a amino group with 5 acetic anhydride. The product is prepared via hydrogen fluoride treatment of the resulting resin. Use When administered to a patient e.g, orally, intravenously, parentally, nasally, or by suppository , the tripeptides are effective in inhibiting gastric hypersecretion, and can be used in the treatment of gastric, peptic, and duodenal ulcers, Zollinger Ellison syndrome gastrinoma , short bowel syndrome, reflex esophagitis, acute erosive gastritis, and pancreatic insufficiency. The tripeptides can be administered to a patient in a dosage of lmcg kg day to 2SOmcg kg day, preferably 5 to loOmcg kg day.
