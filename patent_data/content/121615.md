## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to guttering for roofs of buildings and, more particularly, to a component for locating an end portion of a guttering conduit. It is known to provide guttering of metal or plastics material. Generally metal guttering is more satisfactory than guttering of plastics material because metal guttering is of greater rigidity and therefore does not require as many support members as is required with guttering of plastics material. The most common form of metal guttering is galvanised guttering which is formed oi mild steel coated with zinc to reduce oxidation of the steel.Generally, galvanised guttering is less expensive than guttering of plastics material. However, guttering of plastics material does have an advantage that the material can be moulded so as to provide interconnecting formations whereby guttering conduits can be connected one to another end to end whereas galvanised guttering conduits are secured one to another end to end by solder. Since solder is incompatible with zinc, it is necessary to ensure that surfaces which are to be soldered one to another remain free from zinc. It is also necessary to provide means for supplying heat to the solder so as to render the solder fluid and effect fusion of the surfaces. The necessity of ensuring that surfaces which are to be soldered one to another are free of zinc and the necessity of providing heat to render the solder fluid together with the necessity of providing skilled labour to carry out the process oi soldering guttering conduits one to another end to end nulifies the advantage that galvanised guttering generally is less expensive than guttering of plastics material. It is desirable, therefore, to provide a component for connecting together end to end galvanised guttering conduits such that it is not necessary to solder the conduits one to another. It is known to provide a component for locating an end portion of a conduit, such as a galvanised guttering conduit, wherein the component comprises a curved member for receiving the said end portion. The present invention is characterised in that there is provided a second curved member located adjacent the said curved member and means spacing the said members to form a cavity therebetween whereby the said end portion is insertable in the cavity so as to be retained therein. In this manner, an end portion of a conduit, such as a galvanised guttering conduit, is insertable in the cavity so as to be retained therein and, it is unnecessary to solder the surfaces of the component and the conduit in contact one with another to effect connection of the component and the conduit. Following is a description, by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one example of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings Figure i is a perspective view of one embodiment of a component in accordance with the present invention, Figure 2 is a cross section on the line II II of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a component in accordance with the present invention, Figure 4 is a cross section on the line Iv IV of Figure 3, Figure 5 is a perspective view of a clamp for supporting a conduit relative to a building in a system using components in accordance with the present invention, Figure 6 is a diagrammatic representation showing assembly of a conduit and the clamp shown in Figure 5, Figure 7 is a perspective view of a connecting member for connecting two tubular components end to end in a system incorporating components in accordance with the present invention, Figure 8 is across section on the line VIII VIII of Figure 7, and Figure 9 is a diagrammatic representation of a plurality of tubular components connected end to end by a plurality of connecting members corresponding to the connecting member shown in Figures 7 and 8. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is shown a component 10 for connecting together end to end two galvanised guttering conduits ii and 12. Each of the guttering conduits ii, 12 is curved in cross section and is provided with a longitudinal marginal portion which is outwardly and inwardly curved, as shown at 13, to enhance rigidity of the conduit. The component 10 comprises an outer curved sheet 14 of mild steel a longitudinal marginal edge portion of which is rolled outwardly and inwardly to provide a cavity 15. The outer sheet 14 has located therein an inner curved sheet 16 of smaller radius than the outer curved sheet 14, the inner curved sheet 16 having spaced parallel ribs 17, 18 extending circumferentially of the inner curved sheet and radially outwardly thereof towards the outer curved sheet 14. Both of the sheets 14 and 16 are galvanised, ie. zinc coated, apart from an outer circumferential surface of each of the ribs 17, 18 and corresponding portions of an inner surface of the outer sheet 14 engaged by the ribs 17, 18 which engaged surfaces are welded one to another.The inner curved sheet 16 is provided with slots 19 located between the ribs 17, 18. The combination of the inner and outer sheets 14 and 16 and spacing of the sheets one from another by means of the ribs 17, 18 provide curved cavities 20, 21 at opposite end portions of the component 10.The dimensions of the cavities 20, 2i are such that an end portion of each of the guttering conduits 11, 12 is insertable in a corresponding one of the cavities 20, 21 in an axial direction, the movement continuing until an end wall of each guttering conduit 11, 12 abuts a corresponding one oi the ribs 17, 18 of the cavity 20, 21. A corresponding end portion of the outwardly turned marginal edge portion 13 of each guttering conduit 11, 12 is received in the cavity 15 of the outer sheet 14. In this manner, guttering cdnduits 11, 12 are connectable end to end by the component 10 without the necessity of soldering overlapping surfaces one to another. In order to restrict any relative longitudinal movement of the guttering conduits 11, 12 and the component 10, the cavities 20, 21 and or the corresponding end portions of the guttering conduits 11, 12 which are to be received in the cavities 20, 21 have applied thereto a mastic composition for adhesively securing together the component 10 and the conduits 11 and 12. Additionally, or alternatively, when the component 10 and the conduits 11 and 12 are connected one to another, adjacent exposed inner surfaces of the component 10 and the conduits 11 and 12 may be covered by means of strips of self adhesive tape. The provision of the slots 19 in the inner curved sheet 16 enable the shanks of screws to be inserted through the slots 19 and through corresponding apertures not shown provided in the outer sheet 14 which may be provided prior to connection of the component 10 with the guttering conduits 11, 12 whereby the component 10 can be. secured to a member, such as a bracket. Referring now to Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings, there is shown a component 22 ior providing an end wall to a guttering conduit 23 having an outwardly turned marginal edge portion 24. The component 22 comprises an outer curved sheet 25 an end portion of which is rolled outwardly and inwardly to provide a cavity 26, an inner curved sheet 27 of smaller radius than the outer curved sheet 25 and located within the outer curved sheet 25 and a substantially semi circnlar end plate 28. The end plate 28 is substnatially of the same thickness as the material comprising the guttering conduit 23 and comprises an axially extending circumferential flange 29 and a flange 30 extending transversely, inwardly and downwardly of the end plate 28.The outer and inner curved sheets 25 and 27 and the end plate 28 are of mild steel which is galvanised and the circumferential flange 29 is inserted between the outer and inner curved sheets 25 and 27. The surfaces of the flange 29 and the outer and inner curved sheets 25,27 in contact therewith are clear of galvanised coating and are welded one to another so that there is formed between the outer and inner curved sheets 25, 27 a cavity 31. In use, an end portion of the guttering conduit 23 is inserted in the cavity 31 in an axial direction of the component 22 until an end wall of the guttering conduit 23 abuts the circumferential flange 29 of the end plate 28. As with the component 10, the cavity 31 and or a corresponding end portion of the guttering conduit 23 may have applied thereto a mastic composition for adhesively securing the component 22 and the conduit 23 one to another. Additionally, or alternatively, adjacent inner surfaces of the inner curved plate 27 and the guttering conduit 23 may have applied thereto a strip of self adhesive tape. Referring now to Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings, there is shown a metal clamp 32 comprising a pair of curved members 33, 34 which are connected at one end by means oi a bracket 35 and at opposite end portions thereof by means of an elongate strip 36. The bracket 35 is provided with apertures 37 for receiving screws not shown for securing the bracket 35 to a support not shown . The bracket 35 also is provided with a downwardly extending prong 38. Assuming that the clamp 32 is secured to a support adjacent an edge of a roof of a building, the clamp 32 supports a guttering conduit 39 by inserting under the prong 38 a portion of a marginal edge of the conduit 39 opposite the outwardly rolled marginal edge portion thereof and pressing the conduit 39 downwardly so that the conduit is bedded on the curved members 33, 34, as shown in cross section in Figure 6. The outwardly extending elongate strip 36 then is bent around the rolled marginal edge portion of the conduit 39 in the direction of the arrow in Figure 6 from the position shown in Figure 6 in chain dotted lines to the position shown inFigure 6 in full lines.In this manner, the conduit 39 is firmly secured relative to the bracket 35 and, since the bracket 35 is secured to a support adjacent a roof edge, the conduit 39 also is secured relative to the roof edge. Referring now to Figures 7 to 9 of the drawings, there is shown a cylindrical galvanised component 40 comprising a first cylindrical portion 41 and a second cylindrical portion 42 contiguous therewith. The component 40 connects end to end adjacent cylindrical conduits 43 of uniform diameter and the internal diameter of the first cylindrical portion 41 of the component 40 is in excess of the outer diameter of each of the cylindrical conduits 43 and the outer diameter of the second cylindrical portion 42 of the component 40 is less than the internal diameter of each of the cylindrical conduits 43. In this manner, the second cylindrical portion 42 of the component 40 is insertable in an end portion of a cylindrical conduit 43 and an end portion of another cylindrical portion 43 is insertable in the first cylindrical portion 41 of the component 40 whereby the two cylindrical conduits 43 are connected end to end by the cylindrical component 40. A plurality of cylindrical conduits 43 may be connected end to end by a plurality of cylindrical components 40 to provide a drainage pipe for directing rain water from guttering conduits adjacent a roof, as shown in Figure 9.
