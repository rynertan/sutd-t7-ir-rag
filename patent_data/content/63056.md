# Combinatorial weighing method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A combinatorial weighing method and apparatus there for, the apparatus being of the type which includes a plurality of buckets for carrying articles to be weighed, a conveyor for conveying each of the buckets, and a weight sensor for sensing the weight of each bucket. The method includes steps of storing in memory the empty weight of each bucket following the measurement thereof by the weight sensor, storing in memory the total weight of each bucket and the articles introduced into the bucket, the total weight being measured by the weight sensor, finding the weight of the articles in each bucket by subtracting from the total weight of the bucket and its articles the empty weight of the bucket, selecting, on the basis of weights of the articles, the combination of articles whose overall weight is equal or closest to a preset target weight, and releasing the selected articles from the buckets which carry them.
