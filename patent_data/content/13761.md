# Process for preparing poly ester carbonates from dicarboxylic acid chlorides.

## Abstract
A process for poly ester carbonates from dihydric phenols, especially bisphenol A aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, especially terephthalic acid and phos gene as carbonate precursor wherein a reaction of the acid and phosgene is carried out in a first stage forming dicarboxylic acid chloride and then phosgene and bis phenol A are added in separate streams, simultaneously during most of the second or condensation stage. Thereby only one kettle is required for carrying out the complete polymer production.
