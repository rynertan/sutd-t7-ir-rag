# Classifier.

## Abstract
A classifier has a rotor 14, driven by motor 15, mounted between two opposed walls 32, 34 of housing 10. The housing 10 also has a curved wall 30 which extends between the walls 32, 34 and around the rotor 14 to define therewith an annular zone 50. A fluid and finer particles outlet opening 20 is provided in one of the walls 32, 34. The curved wall 30 has an inlet opening 16 for at least fluid and fluid and coarser particles outlet opening 18 which is registered with the inlet opening of a receptacle 12 from which the coarser particles can be removed. A plate 56 is located immediately upstream of the outlet opening 18 to divert particles adjacent to the curved wall 30 away therefrom. Similar diverting means can be located remote from the plate 56 such as plate 58 or secondary air inlet openings 64 . Baffle rings 60, 62 are provided concentrically with the rotor 14 to restrain particles forced to the outer peripheries of the annular zone 50 from moving inwardly towards the rotor 14.
