# GAS LASER APPARATUS

## Abstract
A gas laser apparatus which has a positive electrode and a negative electrode disposed along a gas flow direction, and a pair of resonance reflectors disposed in a direction that perpendicularly intersects the gas flow direction. The negative electrodes include an appropriate number of unit electrodes connected to a power source. The unit electrodes include a plurality of needle electrodes aligned in the gas flow direction, the respective needle electrodes of which are covered with insulators leaving pointed ends thereof uncovered, and the pointed ends are interconnected by conductive thin wires. The insulators prevent the glow discharge area of the respective needle electrodes from being increased. In addition, the con ductive thin wires serve to cause adjacent needle electrodes to commence glow discharge, whereby stabilization of glow discharge can be achieved. The gas flow velocity may be decreased at the centre of the gas flow path to render the flow velocity more uniform across the gas flow path. For example, a rod structure may extend across the centre of the flow path or the needle electrodes at the centre of the flow path may be thicker than electrodes away from the flow path.
