# Chemiluminescent gas analyzer for measuring the oxides of nitrogen.

## Abstract
A gas analyzer for determining the concentration of the ox ides of nitrogen in a sample gas, particularly exhaust from an internal combustion engine, comprises a sample chamber 11 and a reference chamber 12 . Concentric tubes 14, 15 deliver to the sample chamber 11 sample gas together with ozone Oâ‚ƒ which reacts with the NO in the sample gas to pro duce chemiluminescence. A planar sample photodiode 21 is disposed adjacent the sample chamber 11 to produce a sam ple signal representative of the total photoemissivity of the sample gas. A reference photodiode 22 is disposed adjacent to the reference chamber to provide a reference signal representative of the dark current of the photodiodes and the background photoemissivity of the sample gas. A circuit substracts the reference signal from the sample signal to pro duce an output representative of the concentration of the ox ides of nitrogen in the sample gas. Dilution air is mixed with the sample gas either in the instrument with a viscous metering technique 101 104 or in a sample probe 66 , mounted in the exhaust of the engine, with a sonic metering technique. In other embodiments, a single sample photodiode is used to measure the chemiluminescent reaction and determine the ox ide of nitrogen content of the sample gas.
