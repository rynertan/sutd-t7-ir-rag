## Abstract
The subject invention is related to a battery grid formed from stock material having an open network and an unopen portion thereon wherein the unopen portion lies centrally thereon and the open network portions are of greater thickness than the unopen portion, said open network portions being provided with nodes, said grid being formed by continuously advancing the stock material along a predetermined path, forming spaced apart cut out portions on said unopen portion and simultaneously working the open network portions to orient and size the same whereby the faces of the nodes are displaced. The instant invention also relates to the battery grid so formed, the grid itself comprising a metal grid structure defining a header 28 and a lug connecting section thereon, an open network structure 14 depending from the header over the entire length thereof, said open network being provided with nodes 15 having elements projecting therefrom to define cells, said nodes having a trapezoidal cross section.
