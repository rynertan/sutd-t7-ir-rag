## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of amides from nitriles and amines of polyamides directly from dinitriles and diamines or from aminonitriles. Many kinds of amide compounds including polyamides have so far been developed and used in various industrial fields. These are particularly, but not exclusively, useful as materials for synthetic fibres and plastics moulds, dyeability improvers or antistatic agents for such items, finishing or sizing agents for yarns and textiles, surfactants, coagulants, adhesives, organic solvents, plastics foaming agents, printing ink additives, dyestuffs, organic pigments, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, livestock feeds, and intermediate compounds for preparing such materials. Hitherto, when an amide has been synthesized from a nitrile and an amine, usually the nitrile is hydrolysed and thereby converted into carboxylic acid which is subsequently condensed with the amine. Two US Patent Specifications and one European Patent Specification are particular examples of the synthesis of amides from a nitrile and an amine in the presence of water. Thus US A 3 825 596 discloses a process for preparing N,N dialkyl toluamide by reacting tolunitrile with a di or trialkylamine and water under heated, preferably pressurised conditions, optionally in the presence of a catalyst. Suggested and tried catalysts include zinc chloride, mercuric chloride, cadmium acetate, lead acetate, zinc acetate, copper acetate, cobalt acetate and nickel acetate. US A 4 380 623 discloses a process for preparing amides comprising reacting a nitrile, an amine and water in the presence of a carbon dioxide catalyst. In particular, the preparation of nylon 6,6 is described by reacting adiponitrile, hexamethylene diamine and water in the presence of CO₂. EP A 0 070 424 discloses a process for preparing amides from nitriles and amines in the presence of water and a catalyst at a temperature between 80 and 220 C. The catalyst in this case is a copper derivative which may also contain chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese or zinc. However, conventional manufacturing processes result in various problems. These are related The present invention provides a process for the preparation of organic amides by reaction of a carbonitrile and a primary or secondary amine in which the carbonitrile is reacted directly with an equivalent amount of the primary or secondary amine, the reaction taking place by heating the reactants in the presence of at least a stoichiometric amount of water relative to the carbonitrile reactant, and in the presence of a catalyst comprising a complex containing one or more of ruthenium, rhodium, and molybdenum. This process has a minimum number of steps, so that reaction time is shorter, equipment more compact and operation cleaner. In one of its embodiments the invention develops the above mentioned direct synthesis of amides into synthesis of polyamides with similar advantages. In this specification, the term carbonitrile or nitrile means an organic compound having at least one cyano group in its molecule, and the term amine an organic compound having at least one amino group. Both the cyano group and the amino group may be contained in one molecule, in which case they constitute an aminonitrile compound. Further, the term amide means an organic compound having at least one amide linkage in its molecule, including a so called polyamide. The present invention includes the following three principal and preferred embodiments. In the first preferred embodiment of the invention, the nitrile is represented by the general formula R¹CN where R¹ denotes i an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group of up to 20 carbon atoms, or ii a univalent residue of a 3 to 7 membered heterocyclic group having in the ring up to 3 hetero atoms each of which is O, N or S, with the proviso that the groups defined for R¹ optionally contain one or more of the following substituents an aryl, alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 12 carbon atoms, a univalent residue of a 3 to 7 membered heterocyclic group containing up to 3 hetero atoms each of which is O, N or S, or an OR, CO₂R, NR₂, SR, SiR₃ or CONR₂ group where R is an optionally substituted alkyl group containing up to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group and the amine reactant is of the formula R²R³NH where each of R² and R³ represents a hydrogen atom or a group as defined for R¹, or _NR²R³ is a saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing O, S or another N as hetero atom. In such a case the amide product may be represented by the formula R¹_CO_NR²R³ where R¹, R² and R³ are as defined above. In the second principal embodiment of the invention, the carbonitrile reactant is a dinitrile of the formula R⁴ CN ₂ where R⁴ denotes i an alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, cycloalkylene or arylene group having up to 20 carbon atoms ii a bivalent residue of a 3 to 7 membered heterocyclic group having in the ring up to 3 hetero atoms each of which is O, N or S or iii a group consisting of two aliphatic hydrocarbon residues each having up to 10 carbon atoms bridged by phenylene group, an O, N or S hetero atom, or a bivalent residue of a 3 to 7 membered heterocyclic group having in the ring up to 3 hetero atoms each of which is O, N or S with the proviso that any of such groups optionally contain one or more of the following substituents an aryl, alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 12 carbon atoms, a univalent residue of a 3 to 7 membered heterocyclic group containing up to 3 hetero atoms each of which is O, N or S, or an OR, CO₂R, NR₂, SR, SiR₃ or CONR₂ group where R is an optionally substituted alkyl group containing up to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group and the amine is a diamine of the formula HN R⁵ _ R⁶ _ R⁷ NH where each of R⁵ and R⁷ represents a hydrogen atom or a group as defined for R¹, and R⁶ is a group as defined for R⁴. In this case the product is a polyamide having a recurring unit represented by the following general formula Finally, in the third embodiment of the invention, both the carbonitrile and the amine reactant are the same or different aminonitriles of the formula HN R⁵ _R⁶_CN where R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined as above. In this case the product is a polyamide having recurring units of the formula Depending upon whether the same or two different aminonitriles are used as the nitrile and amine reactants, the repeating units in the polyamide may or may not be the same. Examples of nitriles for use in the first embodiment include acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, 2 methyl 2 butenenitrile, 2 pentenenitrile, 3 pentenenitrile, cinnamonitrile, cyclohexanecarbonitrile, benzonitrile, 2 thiazolecarbonitrile and methoxyacetonitrile. Further, when the reacting amine is a monoamine, nitriles having two or more cyano groups, such as 1,4 dicyanobutane, 1,6 dicyclohexane and methylglutaronitrile may be included in the first embodiment. Examples of amines for use in the first embodiment include methylamine, ethylamine, butylamine, diethylamine, benzylamine, benzylmethylamine, cyclohexylamine, aniline, 2 benzofuranamine, anisidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine and morpholine. Further, when the reacting nitrile is a mononitrile, amines having two or more amine groups, e.g. hexamethylenediamine, 1,2 diaminocyclohexane, diaminopiperazines, and bis hexamethylenetriamines may be used in the first embodiment. In the second embodiment, preferably dinitriles are alkylenedinitriles having the general formula NC CH₂ where R⁵ and R⁷ are as defined above. In the third embodiment, preferable aminonitriles are aminoalkylnitriles having the general formula NC CH₂ where R⁵ is as defined above. In the second and third embodiments, two or more dinitriles and or diamines and two or more aminonitriles may be used and in these cases copolyamides will be obtained. Moreover, nitriles and or amines and aminonitriles that are trifunctional or polyfunctional also can be added in such a manner that nearly stoichiometric proportions as a whole are attained, if required, in order to improve the properties of the resulting polyamides. A small amount of monoamine, mononitrile or monocarboxylic acid may be added to the reaction mixture as a polymerization inhibitor in the second and third embodiments of the invention, in order to control the polymer viscosity. Catalysts preferred in the process of the present invention are the ruthenium complexes RuH₂ PPh₃ ₄ and RuH₂ CO PPh₂ ₃, the molybdenum complex Mo CO ₆ and the rhodium complex Rh CO OH PPh₃ , which have high activity. These catalysts may be used alone or in combination and, if required, along with an appropriate promoter such as a metal hydroxide. Only a catalytic amount is normally required, e.g. 0.001 to 10 mol , preferably 0.1 to 3 mol , based on the starting nitrile, although the reaction can be effected with smaller or larger amounts. It is preferred for the reaction to be carried out in an inert gas. Although the reaction readily proceeds on addition of only the catalyst to amines, nitriles or aminonitriles and water, it will be carried out more effectively in the presence of a water miscible organic solvent such as 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dioxane, pyridine, diglyme or tetrahydrofuran. Though the reaction temperature has no specified upper limit, not higher than 250 C is preferable. The reaction pressure may be atmospheric or higher, if required. The amount of water required is at least one equivalent relative to the nitrile reactant. In general, however, a stoichiometric excess of water will be present, e.g. in the range 1 100 equivalents of water, preferably 1 3 equivalents, relative to the nitrile. Some of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be illustrated by way of the following examples. A magnetic stirrer was put into a test tube of 30 ml capacity, and argon gas was admitted to displace the air.
