# Coated abrasive having brittle agglomerates of abrasive grain and a process of producing the latter.

## Abstract
A coated abrasive product has abrasive grits secured to a flexible backing by maker and size coats, each abrasive grit consisting essentially of an agglomerate 10 of fine abrasive grains 12 having an average diameter less ihan about 200 microns and an inorganic, brittle, matrix 14 . The weight percent of the matrix 14 in each agglomerate 10 is over 35 of the total weight of the agglomerate 10 , and the agglomer ates 10 are sufficiently fragile so that they can be broken down by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger. The agglomerates 10 are essentially free of microporosity, so that the matrix 14 has a relatively high thermal capacity and a relatively high thermal conductivity. The agglomerates 10 have an irregular surface permitting a bond to the maker and size coats which is stronger than the crush strength of the agglomerates 10 to permit gradual wearing down of the agglomerates 10 during grinding by gradual removal of dul led abrasive grains 12 from the agglomerates 10 . A process of preparing agglomerates 10 consists in mix ing a fusible inorganic salt and finely divided abrasive grains 12 , fusing said inorganic salt, freezing said salt and crushing the resultant mixture to agglomerates 10 . Another process of preparing agglomerates 10 consists in mixing a solution of a polymeric inorganic salt with finely divided abrasive grains 12 , casting said inorganic salt and abrasive mixture in a thin layer, heating the layer to drive off water, hardening the layer and crushing the resultant hardened layer to agglomer ates 10 .

## Description
COATED ABRASIVE HAVING BRITTLE AGGLOMERATES OF ABRASIVE GRAIN This invention relates to abrasive agglomerates particularly suitable for the production of coated abrasive products which provide a fine finish to the metal being abraded. Fo many years the coated abrasive industry has worked with various agglomerated abrasive grains as abrasive grits to be used in the manufacture of coated abrasive products. Typical of the older patents in this area is the Jackson Patent U.S. 2,194,472 issued March 26, 1940 Carborundum . In this patent fine abrasive grits are held together by a very minor percentage on the order of 2 5 of an organic or clay bond. The formed aggregates are then bonded to the surface of a sheet by a normal maker adhesive. Another patent in this same general area is Brown U.S. 2,358,313 issued September 19, 1944 3M wherein fine aluminum oxide grains are preferably mixed with a lesser amount of garnet and then fired to vitrify the garnet tobform relatively large bodies of agglomerated aluminum oxide and fused garnet. These bodies are then crushed and graded to obtain the abrasive aggregates. A later patent is the Ball et al U.S. 2,740,239 issued April 3, 1956 Bay State which shows the use of the Jackson type agglomerates on an open mesh abrasive product. More recent activity is represented by Toward and Sowman U.S. Patent 3,916,584 issued November 4, 1975 3M , Wagner U.S. Patent 3,928,949 issued December 30, 1975 Hermes and Lohmer German Auslegeschrift 26 08 273 published September 8, 1977 carborundum . The Wagner patent Hermes shows hollow organic spheres whose surfaces carry a layer of a very fine absasivxO Ths spheres are then secured to the surface of the backing to form a coated abrasive product.The Howard et al patent 3M shows composite abrasive agglomerates in which very fine, hard, abrasive grains are distributed through a porous metal oxide matrix which is formed by sintering. TheCarborundum German patent shows a number of abrasive agglomerates formed with an organic bonding matrix which is porous. The product may also contain an active filler in the agglomerate. The most recent U.S. Patent in this general area is Oberbichler 4,021,208 issued May 3, 1977 Tyrolit . While this patent appears primarily to be directed to a grain for bonded abrasive products, such as grinding wheels, it does have a statement that it can be utilized for abrasive coated paper.In this Tyrolit patent there is no bonding agent, as such, for bonding the fine abrasive aluminum oxide grains together rather the aluminum oxide is sintered to form a porous compact and the pores are thereafter at least partially filled with an active filler such as a halide, sulfide or the like. The present invention providers abrasive grits and coated abrasive products made therefrom where the grits constitute agglomerates of fine abrasive grains, there being preferably many abrasive grain8 in each grit. The abrasive grains are held in the agglomerates by an inorganic, brsttie, matrix bond, the volume percent of the bond being preferably greater than the volume percent of the abrasive grains in these agglomerates. Ihisbrittle matrix bond has a relatively high thermal conductivity and a relatively high heat capacity so that the abrading operation runs cooler than a comparable abrasive grain operating without the high heat capacity brittle matrix bond. This matrix bond is essentially free of microporosity i.e the type of microporosity typical of conventionally sintered products and typical 3of prior art prcducta made with intestitial voids so as not to interfere with its thermal conductivity and heat capacity.The agglomerates preferably have a crush strength as measured by the crush test described hereinafter of less than 20 lbs.in2 but greater than mull 10 1bs. in The matrix preferably has a hardness of mil less than about 4 mohs so that the agglomerates can be broken down by rubbing a plurality of agglomerates between the thumb and forefinger. The agglomerates have an irregular surface permitting a bond to the maker and size coats which is stronger than the crush strength of the agglomerates to permit gradual wearing down of the agglomerates during grinding by gradual removal of dulled abrasive grains from the agglomerates. There are two preferred general classes of matrix bonds suitable for this invention both include a grinding aid salt. The first matrix bond consists essentially of a fused grinding aid salt. The second bond consists essentially of a silicate which contains a grinding aid salt. In this latter case the bond is not fused it is a silicate ionic bond. In the first type of bond, i.e. fusion bond, the griding aid salt is preferably, but not exclusively, one which has some solubility for the aluminum oxide abrasive grain so as to measurably dissolve the grain and provide rounded corners to the individual fine grains. This has the effect of providing for a very fine finish on the ground metal. The expression grinding aid salt is intended to include those salts which react with the metal being ground to prevent loading of the abrasive belt, to. increase the rate of cut, or to prevent rewelding of the hot metal to the piece from which it has just been removed. In those cases where the metal is stainless steel, for example, the simple and complex halides have been proven to be very effective grinding aids. Where the metal is carbon steel an oxygen supplr a as a perchlorate may serve the grinding aid function. Figs, 1, la and 2 are schematic, diagramatic and greatly enlarged cross sectional views of the agglomerates of the present invention Figs, 3 through 9 are graphs showing relative performance of coated abrasive products made in accordance with the present invention as compared to commercially available products used as controls. Referring to Fig. 1 the abrasive agglomerate is indicated by the numeral 10 as containing fine abrasive grits 12 held in a binder matrix 14. As can be seen in Fig. 1 the abrasive grains are randomly oriented in the agglomerate however the agglomerate does have rough corners 10a which permit formation of a strong mechanical bond to the maker and size coats used in normal coated abrasive manufacturing techniques. Fig. la is an enlarged diagramatic view of a portion of Fig0 1 showing in dotted lines at 12a the initial outline of an aluminum oxide abrasive grain and in full lines the rounded off corners of this grain resulting from a partial solution of the grain in the molten matrix binder eeg. when the binder is a solvent for aluminum oxide, such as is the case with cryolite. Fig. 2 is similar to Fig0 1 but in this case the product is formed by coating a mud like paste of the silicate binder onto a carrier substrate under a knife blade thus giving some orientation to the aluminum oxide grains within the agglomerate. As mentioned previously there are two preferred embodiments of the invention, both involving an active fill r, either as the bond for the fine abrasive grain, or as a major constituent thereof. In the first embodiment the matrix bond comprises cryolite which is melted with the desired fine less than 200 microns abrasive graina. The molten mass is then cooled and crushed to the desired grit size and then formed into coated arasvies piedtst using maker and size coats.In a preferred embodiment the DÃ­ze coat is an innately fr abl resin filled beycnd the critical pigment volume with a pcwdered grinding aid such as cryolite. EXAMPLE I 1500 Grams of 150 grit fused crushed aluminum oxide and 1500 grams of cryolite Na3A1F6 were thoroughly mixed and then fused in a claygraphite container at a temperature of 1050 11000C. The fused mixture was cooled to room temperature and then crushed into 50 grit and 80 grit size agglomerates. 50 Grit agglomerates will pass through A 38GG screen and be retained on a No. 3 STD. screen and 80 grit agglomerates will pass a No. 3 STD. screen and be retained on a No. 9STD. screen. These screen terms are as defined by theAmerican National Standard Institute ANSI . The aluminum oxide came from Norton Company and is sold as their commercial grade E296 having an average particle size of 100 microns and grading specifications as determined by the Coated Abrasives Manufacture s Institute CAMI .The cryolite had an average particle size of 15 microns and was obtained from Kryolitselekabet Oresund S A of Denmark. Cryolite has a mohs hardness of about 2.50 The 50t grit and 80 grit agglomerates were then coated on cloth belts having a normal maker coat of phenolic resin and about 1 2 normal thickness.The size coat was a friable, cryolite overfilled phenolic resin. Two types of size coats were used, one designated 8169 contained 428 parts of a phenclic resin 8169 C obtained from Varcum Division of ReicholdChemical Company 1426 parts of cryolite S, 200 parts of water, 80 parts of solox a denatured ethyl alcohol containing benzene and kerosene and 10 parts of Santocel Z , a silica gel. The second size coat is designated 2955 and contained 666 parts of Varcum 2955 a phenolic resin obtained from Varcum Division of Reichold , 2142 parts of cryolite 6, 450 parts of water and 200 parts of solox. The amount of the 80 tri t and 50 grit agglomerates on the products were 18 1bs ream and 22 1bs ream, or about 270 g m2 and 330 g m2, respectively.This was calculated to give 135 grams and 165 grams of 150 grit aluminum oxide per square meter of cloth, respectively. A commercial Resinall Metallite Type 8 coated abrasive sold by Norton Company was obtained as a standard control product. This has been coated with 150 grit aluminum oxide with about 15 Sc lbs ream or 220 grams per square meter of aluminum oxide grain. The experimental product and standard were then tested on 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel in accordance with the following procedure. Belt Testing Approximately ten workpieces of either 10188 or 304SS were pre roughed on a modified bench backstand grinder by an appropriate coarse grit belt. The belt chosen would provide a scratch pattern of 250 300 micro inches in for subsequent testing of 150 grit products, or 150 220 in for testing of 220 grit products. The sample belts, containing either agglomerate grain systems or conventional control grains, measured 2 1 2 x 60 and were tested on the same grinder used for pre roughing. The traverse or scan speed of the contact wheel was 7 surface feet per minute SFPM , while the belt speed was 5000 SFPM for 1018s and 3000 SFPM for 304SS. In all cases, the direction of motion of the belt was parallel to the long axis of the workpiece. Workpieces were bar stock that measured approximately 1 x 2 x 10 t these were tested on their l side, and scanned back and forth for their entire 10 length, which required a total period or interval of 15 sec. Grinding was conducted under the constant force of 10 lb or 20 lb dead weights that provided constant interfacial pressures of 20 or 40 psi, assuming 1 2 in2 of belt was in contact with the workpiece. roughed workpiece was used in three such fiteen ze ond test intervals, with weight loss in grams and finish readings in p in. recorded after each interval. rhis could have allowed estimates on rate of finish refinement, but in almost all cases the first interval in each set of 3 was sufficient to bring the finish readings down to their equilibrium value at the pressures and interval durations used here. Between sets of 3 intervals, old workpieces were removed and new pre roughed workpieces were emplaced. Twenty to fifty such intervals thoroughly characterized cut and finish behavior, but the real endpoint for testing was based on rate of cutO Testing for any product was stopped after that interval in which the rate of cut i.e., grams loss was less than a predetermined fraction of the rate of cut of the control product in its first interval IROC C . This predetermined fraction was 1 4, 1 3, or 1 2 the IROC c, depending on the type of test and other conditions.However, 1 3 was most commonly used. The data thus generated were used in a computer program to provide several types of characterizing numbers, such as relative cut, total cut in grams, life in minutes, extrapolated initial cut, average rate ofcut, and slope of the function log cummulative but ve log 1 time . The latter has been shown to be a straight line for almost all realistic product testing situation. The parameters are defined in the Glossary of Terms following Table I. Analogous characterizing numbers were also generated for finish behavior using a modification of the same computer program. The results of these tests are shown in Table I. Disc Testing Several workpieces of 1018 steel were re roughed with a slightly worn, 7 , 24 grit NORZO disc on a bench mounted disc grinder. This provided a 250 350 in scratch pattern. Other relevant conditions were disc r.p.m. 3450 angle between the plane of the disc and the workpiece 100 disc scan rate r 7 SFPM workpiece dimensions 1 4 x 3 x 15 e Sample testing with agglomerate grain systems and conventional control grains was performed using 7 discs in single, one minute intervals. This required the discs to scan back and forth approximately eight times. A 15 lb dead weight provided about 9 p.sei interfacial pressure on the 3 side of the workpieces.These were renewed at each interval after weight loss and finish readings were taken. The determination of end point was the same as that for belt testing, and the same computer program was used for data reduction of cut and finish behavior.

As a visual example, Fig. 3 shows the performance results of one test product from Table I solid line compared with the control product open circles on the 1018 steel. Fig. 4 shows the test results of another of these products 80 grit tested against 304 stainless steel. EXAMPLE II In this case 220 grit aluminum oxide is used in place of the 150 grit aluminum oxide of Example I.It was also obtained from Norton Company. The aluminum oxide had an average particle size of about 70 microns, and conventional grading specifications as determined by CAMI. The cryolite was the same as that used inExample I however the weight ratio of cryolite toA1203 was 3 2 rather than the 1 1 of Example I. This material was coated to an agglomerate weight of 16 lbs ream or 96 grams per square meter of aluminum oxide on abrasive belts, and given a size coat with resins similar to those in Example I. A conventional product exhibits a grain weight of about 12 lbs ream or 180 g m2 of aluminum oxide grain. These products were tested on 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel at 20 and 36 p.s.i. The results of these tests are shown in Table II below.

EXAMPLE III In the second system for forming the abrasive agglomerates of the present invention, the binder is a silicate containing an active filler such as cryolite. In the preferred embodiment, 2 parts by weight of grain such as 150 grit aluminum oxide of the type utilized in Example I above are mixed with 2 parts of cryolite of the type described in Example I, and with 1 part of potassium silicate solution gold by Sauereisen under the designation Binder Âµ65. These silicates upon cure normally have a mohs hardness of less than 2.This produced a mixture having the consistency of mortar which was then deposited in cookion lized extrusion. on a silicone release substrate, dried in a hot air oven at 2500F, and crushed to about 80 grit size. A similar batch was prepared utilizing a 8 4 3 ratio of cryolite to 150 grit aluminum oxide to Binder num 65. Both formulations were then formed into product. of coated abrasive belts utilizing the same general techniques described in Example I above.They were tested against a commercial 150 grit aluminum oxide belt sold by Norton Company under the designation Resinall Metalite Type 8. The test results from these two experimental products against the commercial standard on 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel are shown in Table III.

EXAMPLE IV In another embodiment of the second system for forming abrasive agglomerates of the present invention, the silicate binder and cryolite are premixed with a solution containing a surface active agent. These have been termed Silicate Paste Binder or SPB agglomerates.In the preferred embodiment, grain such as 150 grit aluminum oxide of the type in Example I is added to the above pre mixture to form a thixotropic or shearthinning paste which was then coated under a knife on silicone release paper to a wet thickness of about 1 8 .The paste on its coated paper was cured to a semi dry, rubbery state for 20 30 minutes at 275 300 P and drawn through a roll flexer to break the resulting greenstate crude into 2 long x 1 2 wide strip The strip.were collected on trays and heat soaked for 2 hers. at 2500F. The formulation of the preferred embodiment on a weight basis is 38 parts cryolite 32 parts 150 A O grain 24 parts num 65 Silicate Binder and 2 parts of 0.2 Aerosol OT solution. Aerosol OT is manufactured byAmerican Cyanamid Corporation. Other organic BR inorganic surface active materials could be used as well. The fully cured crude was crushed to about 70g sizes and made into both abrasive cloth belts and vulcanized fiber discs. Results from testing on belts are similar to those in Table III. Results from testing testing with fiber discs are shown in Table IV.

Fig. 9 shows the performance on 1018S of another test product fromTable IV that used the large batch fusion agglomerates with 55 45 formulation compared to the same control used in Fig. 8. Crush Test In order to characterize the agglomerates and differentiate these products from agglomerates of the prior art, the following test method was developed.Agglomerates whose crush strength is to be measured are vibrated into a settling cell which has an internal cylindrical diameter of 1 2 and is 1 deep. This 1 by 1 2 cylinder is then completely filled and this accurately controlled amount is then deposited and settled into a measuring cell also having a 1 2 cylindrical diameter but of greater depth. A compression piston of 1 2 diameter is fitted. into the measuring cell after the deposited agglomerates have been vibrated into maximum loose pack density. An Instron Stress StrainTester having a 1000 lb. force cell and a compression cage was used with a cross head speed of 0.5 inches per minute. The amount of eompression in mils was measured at 50 lb. force and at 500 lb. force levels and the difference was divided into the difference in force per 2 cell area, e.g. 450 lbs. divided by 0.1963 in. divided by the measured mils of compr6ssion. Measured data were taken from a strip chart recorder attached to the Instron Tester, The test data obtained re listen i 1 Table IV below.

With respect to the upper limit of crush strength, whila it s possible to go as high as 25 or 30, it is believed that at these higher crush strengths, the surface finish will suffer and the finish will be more representative of the finish comparable to the grit size of the agglomerate rather than the grit size of the individual grains making up the agglomerate. The present invention has many advantages, enumerated below, which contribute to a greatly improved product. While many of these advantages are present, individually, in the prior art none of the prior art, so far as is known, contains so many of these advantages grouped together. These advantages include 1. Cooler grinding operations. The product of the present invention will provide a cooler grinding e.g. lower temperatura sparks, workpieces, and abrasive products than comparable grinding utilizing the same abrasive grit in the same grinding operation but without the agglomerates of th present invention. This is believed to be true because of its improved cutting efficiency, and the longer lifetime before the heatproducing end period.This is believed to be due to the heat sink characteristic of the matrix binder resulting from the high thermal conductivity of the binder and the lack of microporority of the binder. 2. Controlled gradual attrition of the agglomerates. This arises from the relatively weak intra agglomerate bond of the matrix binder. 3. Intimate contact of a grinding aid with the grain workpiece interface. This result. from the fact that the grinding aid is either the matrix binder itself or it is present in large quantities in the matrix binder inthe preferred embodiment of the invention.This means that the grinding aid is present in the exact place where it i. needed. This provide. the possibility of using less total grinding aid than as required if the grinding aid is put in the size coating, for example. 4. Longer life from higher attainable grain weights, if desired. Agglomerates permit a higher total amount of grain to be applied to a given area of the coated abrasive product for a given grit size of the individual abrasive grain.The coated abrasive product can continue to cut long after a single layer of individual grits would have been destroyed. Alternatively, the amount of grain in agglom ratag can be reduced far below 50 of the agglomerate weight, resulting in grain weight ranging from 1 2 to 2 3 those of conventional products while still providing relative cut and life 100 to 500 greater.That is, the agglomerate concept develops a higher grain efficiency, with each abrasive grain able to do more work than in conventional products. 5. Large and more uniform rats of cut.This stems from the fact that, since the agglomerates are more widely spaced than individual grains, there can be higher unit pressures on each cutting grain as it operates. This provides higher rates of cut, and the wide spacing deters nloading of the abrasive surface.The longer life of the cut results from the fact that as one individual grain is used up it is torn out of the agglomerate and the next lower abrasive grain starts to go to work. 6. Improved activity in electrostatic fialds.Salt matrix agglomerates generally and those based on the silicate binder, in particular, have extreme activity in an electrostatic field for electrostatic coating of the agglomerates on the fresh maker coat. It has been found that only 8 to 10 thousand volts are required for coating the 80 grit agglomerates of 150 grit aluminum oxide.This contrast to 25 to 35 thousand volts required for coating regular 80 grit aluminum oxide 150 grit aluminum oxide requires 15 to 25 thousand volts under the same conditions. 7. Improved anchoring of the agglomerates in the maker and size coats. This results from the sharp corners and edges on the agglomerates to provide a strong mechanical bond to the maker and size coats. This mechanical bond to the maker and size coats is stronger than the intraagglomerat bond between the individual abrasive grain. 8. A finer and more uniform finish behavior than conventional products in the major portion of product lifetime, beyond the break in period. This results from the fact that individual abrasive grains are very fine and they act as very fine grains during cutting. Also the rate of cut is more typical of the size of the agglomerate rather than the size of the individual grain doing the cutting. The more uniform rate and more uniform finish results from the gradual attrition of the agglomerate. The finer finish also is attributed to the massive amount of matrix binder which is present in the gt3iomerate to limit the depth of penetration into the workpiece of the individual grain.during the grinding action, thereby providing a surface finish comparable to the surface finish utilizing unagglomerated abrasive grains of the grit size of the individual grains in the agglomerates. While aluminum oxide has been mentioned above in connection with the preparation of these particular abrasive agglomerates, numerous other abrasive materials, such as silicon carbide and the various aluminum oxide alloys such as alumina zirconia may be employed. Similarly, other matrix binders can be utilized. The principal requirements for these binders being that they be relatively inexpensive materials, that they be relatively inexpensive to prepare and that the bond between the individual grains has the degree of friability desired to permit discard of the individual abrasive grains after they have become dulled as a result of the grinding operation.As mentioned previously it is preferred that the matrix binder be present in a weight percent of at least 35 and preferably with a volume percent greater than the volume percent of the abrasive grain and that it be an inorganic brittle material. Without intent to limit the invention the following crystalline inorganic materials could potentially be utilized in the fusion system of Example I.

It is felt that the size coat performs a very significant function in the present invention since it serves to anchor the relatively fragile agglomerates firmly to the coated backing. As a result of the size coat and maker coat combination the mechanical bond to the backing is stronger than the intraagglomerate bond between the individual abrasive grains. Each agglomerate is firmly held so that it can make the individual abrasive grains available to the surface to be ground as the grains at the top surface are gradually dulled and discarded. If this mechanical bond is not adequately strong the whole abrasive agglomerate will be ripped from the backing rather than having the individual grains torn from the agglomerate, which is the desired effect. At the same time, the size coat deposited on the sides and top of the anchored agglomerate must be itself friable enough to war away at matched attrition rates with the agglomerate. In the preferred embodiment, size coats of innately friable phenolic resins filled beyond the critical pigment volume overfilled with conventional mineral fillers have provided these charActeristic.
