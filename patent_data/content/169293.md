# A chair back with adjustable lumbar support.

## Abstract
A chair back, particularly intended for an automobile seat, is provided with a support part 6 suspended in a frame structure 2 having two elongated side elements 10, 11 which extend along the chair back and which are connected together by means of connecting members. The connecting members are held tensioned, by suspending the side elements in the frame structure. Each side element 10, 11 is arranged to co act with a respective tensioning device 16, 17 connected to both ends of a respective side element. The tensioning devices are arranged to subject the side elements to buckling forces of such high magnitude as to cause the side elements to arch, with the centre regions of the arch facing forwards. In this way. there is formed a support for the lumbar region, or small of the back. The chair back also includes an adjusting means 20 which is arranged to co act with the tensioning devices in a manner to adjust the position of the lumbar support, by changing the size of the arch.
