# A METHOD OF REDUCING THE VOLUME OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE

## Abstract
Combustible, radioactive waste, such as paper, plastics, rubber, cloth and wood, are reduced in volume to an ash residue using pyrohydrolysis, a method which combines pyrolysis of the waste in a vessel at temperatures in the range of 500 to 700 C and gasification of residual carbon with superheated steam. Pressures of 1.0 to 3.5 MPa are used with steam flows in the range 4 to 50 mL s mÂ³ so that carbon containing components of the waste are removed as gaseous oxides.
