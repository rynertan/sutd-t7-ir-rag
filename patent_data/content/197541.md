# System for controlling operation mode of modulator demodulator.

## Abstract
A modulator demodulator operation mode control sys tem 40 specifies an operation mode, which is a combina tion of particular data transmission rate, multi phase PSK modulation system, error correction coding rate and others, in which a modulator demodulator is to operate, while deciding the operation mode and controlling the modulator demodulator. A transmit station designates a particular operation mode in a plurality of bits in terms of polarities of unique words, while a receive station switches a demodula tor 42 thereof to the designated operation mode responsive to an output of mode switchover signal decision means 50 and based on signal representative of detection of the unique words.
