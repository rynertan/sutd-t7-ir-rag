# DISK DRIVE CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
The apparatus allows a single drive to serve two control lers which provide control signals on respective buses CBI 1 and CBI 2 1609 and 1613 including RESERVE and RELEASE instructions. These instructions are applied to respective programmable logic arrays PLAs 1601, 1603 which also receive signals fed back from state registers 1605, 1607 . The registers include bits ERES1, ERES2 which are set when respective RESERVE Instructions are received and ERES2, ERES1 respective 0, bits IRES1, IRES2 which are set when respective RESERVE instructions are received while ERES2, ERES1 respectively 1 and INT1, INT2 which are set when ERES1, ERES2 1 and ERES2, ERES1 0 respectively. INT1 and INT2 send interrupts back to the respectively controllers and a controller which is thus enabled to use the drive does so in a succession of operations involving resetting of INT1, INT2 by a status control instruction from the controller. When the controller is finished it sends the RELEASE instruction to reset ERES1, ERES2 as the case may be. If a controller sends a RESERVE instruction, say on CBI 1 , when the other controller is using the drive, i.e. ERES2 1, ERES1 is not set but IRES1 is set. When the other controller sends RELEASE and resets ERES2, this reset in conjunction with IRES1 1 causes ERES1 to be set. The combination ERES1 1 and ERES2 0 causes INT1 to be set, as above.
