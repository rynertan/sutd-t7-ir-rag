# Composite material including alpha alumina fibers.

## Abstract
A fiber reinforced metal type composite material. The reinforcing fiber is alumina fiber formed from at least 80 by weight alumina and the remainder silica, with the alpha alumina content of the alumina approximately between about 5 and about 60 by weight of the total amount of alumina. The matrix metal is selected from the group consisting of aluminum, magnesium, and their alloys. There by mechanical strength, resistance to wear, and workability of the fiber reinforced metal type composite material are good, and also friction wear on elements which frictionally rub against and mate with components made of the fiber reinforced metal type composite material is low
