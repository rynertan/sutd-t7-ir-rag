# Process of forming recessed dielectric regions in a silicon substrate.

## Abstract
A method of forming a planar surface on a substrate during removal of excess dielectric material when fabricating recessed regions of dielectric material. A dielectric SiO₂ layer 16 is formed on the surface of the silicon substrate 10, 12, 14 , a relatively thick layer of polycrystalline silicon 18A is deposited over the SiO₂ layer, openings are formed through the polycrystalline layer and SiO₂ layer and into the substrate to form trenches, a layer of dielectric material 22A is vapor deposited over the surface of the substrate to a depth sufficient to fill the trenches, a planarizing layer 26A is deposited over the layer of dielectric material, the planarizing layer, the dielectric layer and the polycrystalline layer are reactive ion etched and the remaining polycrystalline silicon layer is selectively removed to expose the SiO₂ layer.
