# Helical screw rotary compressor for air conditioning system.

## Abstract
A compressor 20 is connected in series with a conde nser 24 and an evaporator 26 , in that order, with the evaporator 26 at a raised position relative to the compress or 20 and utilizes a vaporizable refrigerant which is miscible with the lubricating oil employed. Helical screw rotors 18, 44 are driven by the engine 12 of a bus through a clutch 14 and are mounted within parallel intersecting bores 40, 42 within the compressor housing 28 . A slide valve 52 sliding in a recess 54 forms a portion of the screw compressor envelope and the rotors 18, 44 open to a suction port 72 connected to the outlet side of the evaporator 26 . A high pressure discharge port 68 leads to an auxiliary chamber 86 including an oil separator 88 and bearing an unload cylinder 66 which drives the slide valve 52 and which opens to a discharge port 92 leading to the condenser 24 . An oil drain passage 96 leads from the auxiliary chamber 86 to an oversized oil sump 32 and a further drain passage 104 leads through a drainage check valve 113 to the sump 32 .
