# Adaptive control system.

## Abstract
A method of adaptive control for use in a controlled system 12 having an adjustable forward loop gain and a control system apparatus for carrying out the method are disclosed. The control system 12 measures the value of a parameter which is to be controlled and generates an error signal E by comparing the measured valve of the parameter with a desired valve. The error signal is squared and the time derivative of the squared error signal is obtained. The control system compares the length of time that the derivative so obtained has a positive value to the time it has a negative value to obtain a gain control signal, and applies the gain control signal to the forward loop gain. The gain control signal reduces the adjustable forward loop gain until a preselected margin of stability in the controlled system is obtained.
