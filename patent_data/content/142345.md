# ANTI IDIOTYPIC VACCINE EMPLOYING ANTI IDIOTYPIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES

## Abstract
Anti idiotypic vaccines and methods for making anti idiotypic vaccines are described which employ a combina tion of anti idiotypic monoclonal antibodies emulsified with an adjuvant. When administered to an immune responsive subject, the anti idiotypic vaccine may elicit an immune response which includes the immunogenic production of an array of idiotypic antibodies directed against a designated infectious disease organism or other pathogenic agent. Each anti idiotyptc monoclonal antibody within the anti idiotypic vaccine is developed through a multistep process which begins by challenging immune responsive subjects with antigen from an infectious disease organism or other pathogenic agent. A variety of selection steps occur for idiotypic monoclonal antibody and for anti idiotypic monoc lonal antibody both before and after the hybridoma expan sion for each. The selected anti idiotypic monoclonal anti body has a variable region that defines its antigen binding site which displays a structural conguence with at least one epitope found on the infectious disease organism or pathogenic agent. The antigenicity of this antigen binding site is similar to the antigenicity of the epitope found on the infectious disease organism or other pathogenic agent. Each anti idiotypic monoclonal antibody may be fully characte rized as to its antigenic potential, its immunogenic specific ity, and the neutralizing efficacy of its immune response. The selection and compounding of useful anti idiotypic monoc lonal antibody within the anti idiotypic vaccine and the dosage optimization of each component enhances the clinical utility of the anti idiotypic vaccine. In order to minimize zenogenic effects, the anti idiotypic vaccine may include Fab fragments of the anti idiotypic monoclonal antibodies. Methods are described for producing and select ing the component anti idiotypic monoclonal antibodies from idiotypic monoclonal antibodies directed against the designated infectious disease organism or other pathogenic agent. Methods are described for using the anti idiotypic vaccines to impart either active or passive immunity.
