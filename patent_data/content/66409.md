# Charged particle source.

## Abstract
A charged particle beam source which can be used both as an electron source and as an ion source has a tip 1 formed of a carbide, nitride or di boride of at least one of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb and Ta or of a hexa boride of at least one of the rare earth elements of atomic number 57 to 70. Switching means 8, 9, 10 enable simultaneous change of the polarity of the tip 1 relative to a first electrode 11 and of the first electrode 11 relative to a second electrode 12 .
