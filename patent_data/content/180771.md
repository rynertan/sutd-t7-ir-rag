# Method for improving impulse breakdown strength of electrically insulating materials.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method for improving the impulse breakdown strength of an electrically insulating material which is characterized by employing, as said electrical insulating material, an ethylene copolymer pre pared by high pressure radical polymerization of ethylene or a mixture of ethylene and another monomer in the presence, of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of one to three ring aromatic compounds except styrene and substituted styrenes each having a single ring each having one carbon carbon double bond in one molecule, at a polymerization pressure of 500 to 4,000 kg cmÂ² at a polymer ization temperature of 50 to 400 C, wherein said ethylene copolymer contains 0.005 to 1 mol of a unit derived from said aromatic compound as component of the polymer.
