# Electric travelling support.

## Abstract
The travelling support 1 comprises a piezo electric plate 2 resting on three legs 6 whose bottom surface is insulated from the bench 8 on which the support is to travel, by a dielectric 7 . The piezo electric plate 2 can be caused to contract by means of an actuating voltage applied via sliders 9, 10 to top and bottom electrodes on the plate 2 . By applying a voltage to the legs 6 , these may be clamped selectively by electrostatic forces effective across the dielectric 7 . Appropriate control of the actuating and clamping voltages causes the support 1 to either move in a linear or rotary fashion. The displacements the support can perform per step are in the nanometer range.
