# Heat developable color light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A heat developable color light sensitive material com prising a support having thereon at least a light sensitive silver halide, a binder, a dye releasing redox compound which is capable of reducing the light sensitive silver halide and is capable of reacting with the light sensitive silver halide by heating to release a hydrophilic dye and a salt of an alkylcarboxylic acid having a triple bond between the α position carbon atom and the β position carbon atom with an organic base as a base precursor. The heat developable color light sensitive material containing the novel base precursor has good stability during preservation and provides a color image having a high color density and low fog in a short time by a simple procedure. A method of forming a color image using the heat developable color light sensitive material is also dis closed.
