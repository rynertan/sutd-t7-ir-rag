## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor circuit, more particularly, to a circuit applied in, for example, a static semiconductor memory for generating a clock signal when an input signal, such as the address signal, changes. A static memory generally does not need a clock signal, in contrast to a dynamic memory which always needs a clock signal. Some special static memories, however, use clock signals to represent address changes, write instructions, or power downs, to decrease the access time, and so forth. In static memories using the clock signals, when a memory cell of the static memory is accessed, a bit line pair is temporarily short circuited to be the same potential by applying a clock signal and then is changed to a high H level or a low L level in accordance with the data stored in the memory cell. This decreases the access time in comparison with the case without using a clock signal, wherein the change is effected from the H or L state depending on the previously read stored data to the H or L state depending on the stored data which is to be currently read. This short circuiting is also effected in a sense amplifier, wherein the response speed for currently read data is increased by resetting the output signals by the clock signal before starting the operation of the sense amplifier. A clock signal representing a change of an input signal, such as an address signal, is conventionally generated by taking a logical OR of pulses generated by changes of respective input signals. For example, the address signals as the input signals are 10 bits in a 1K memory, 11 bit in a 2K memory, and so forth. From each bit of the address signals, a complementary pair of bit However, the clock signal thus generated has a problem in that, when the rising time and the falling time of the input signals are indefinite, the clock width of the clock signal changes depending on the input signals. When the input signals are input address signals, this problem is caused because 1 since the address inverters and, accordingly, the above mentioned pulse generating circuits are present over a certain area of a memory chip, the wiring lengths between each pulse generating circuit and the OR gate are different from each other, so that the timings of the output pulses reaching the OR gate are slightly different 2 since the pulses output from the respective pulse generating circuits do not always have the same pulse widths, the pulse widths of the clock signals and the falling timings of the clock pulses are changed depending on which address signal is changed 3 there is a case when a plurality of address signals bits are changed almost simultaneously but at slightly different timings, and, in this case, since the clock width is a logical sum of the plurality of pulses, the pulse width has a tendency to expand because the pulse widths generated by the respective changes of the address signals are not always the same. It is not preferable, in order to ensure the short circuiting of the pair of bit lines and so forth, that the clock pulse width be changed depending on which of the input signals or which of the input address signals changes. Therefore, for the above mentioned reset of the bit line pair or of the sense amplifier, the clock signal is required to have at least a predetermined pulse width and constant falling and rising timings in response to each change of the input signals. It is accordingly desirable to provide a semiconductor circuit which can provide a pulse with at least a constant pulse width in response to each change of input signals. US A 3 601 636 discloses a single shot device having two NAND gates interconnected to provide an output pulse of fixed duration in response to an input signal, obtained using an RC delay circuit interposed between the two NAND gates. For short input pulses, the output pulse is the same length regardless of the input signal, but for longer input pulses the output pulse has at least the duration of the input pulse. EP A 0 105 757 by the present applicant discloses an asynchronous memory device having an address change detector which generates a clock signal of selected pulse width in response to a change in an address signal. The address change detector includes a set of pulse generators each responsive to a respective address bit, and an OR gate receiving the pulses from the pulse generators, the output of the OR gate constituting the clock signal. J. Markus, Modern Electronic Circuits Reference Manual , McGraw Hill, 1980, discloses on page 680 a so called PWM MONO circuit which provides pulse width modulation with high duty cycles and complementary output. The output pulse is generated from a NOR gate and lasts at least as long as a STROBE input signal applied to the NOR gate. According to the present invention, there is provided a clock signal generating circuit of a semiconductor memory device, comprising Thereby, the present invention can guarantee a predetermined minimum duration of an output clock signal, whilst allowing the output clock signal to be elongated in response to appropriate input signals. Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a semiconductor memory chip. In Fig. 1, the semiconductor memory chip CP has a memory cell array MCA, a plurality of address inverters AI₀ , AI₁ , ..., and AI Since the lengths of the conducting lines ℓ₀ , ℓ₁ , ..., and ℓ Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a semiconductor circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2, A₀ , A₁ , A₂ , ... are bits of an address for accessing a static memory, and PG₀ , PG₁ , PG₂ , ... are pulse generating circuits provided in address inverters AI₀ , AI₁ , ... Fig. 1 for receiving respective bits A₀ , A₁ , ... of the address. Each pulse generating circuit PG The outputs of the pulse generating circuits PG₀ , PG₁ , PG₂ , ..., and PG The generating timings here, the falling timings of the clock signals of the pulse generating circuits PG₁ , PG₂ , ... are relatively constant. The fluctuations occur in the end timings here, the rising timings . Because of these fluctuations, the pulse width of the output clock signal was not always constant. In the present invention, the clock signal generating circuit CG is provided with a circuit WC for making the output pulse width constant. The circuit WC consists of a latch and reset circuit, constructed by P channel MOS transistors Q₇ and Q₈ connected in series between the power supply V Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of the clock signal generating circuit CG and the circuit WC included in the circuit shown in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 3, in the latch and reset circuit formed by the P channel MOS transistors Q₇ and Q₈ and the N channel MOS transistors Q₉ and Q₁₀ , the gate of the transistor Q₇ is connected to the output end of the inverter formed by the transistors Q₃ and Q₄ the gate of the transistor Q₈ is connected to the output end of the control circuit CNT the gate of the transistor Q₉ is connected to the output end of the CMOS inverter formed by the transistors Q₃ and Q₄ and the gate of the transistor Q₁₀ is connected to the output end of the control circuit CNT. In the control circuit CNT, the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄ form one CMOS inverter, and the transistors Q₃₁ and Q₃₂ form another. The gates of the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄ function as an input end of the control circuit CNT and are connected to the output end T₁ of the NAND gate. The output of the CMOS inverter formed by the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄ is connected to the gates of the transistors Q₃₁ and Q₃₂. The source of the transistor Q₃₄ is connected through the resistor R to the ground power supply V Figures 4A through 4F show the potential changes in respective portions in the circuit shown in Fig. 3. In Figs. 4A 4F, ₀ and ₁ represent pulses generated by the pulse generating circuits PG₀ and PG₁ and 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 represent potential changes of the nodes 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 in the circuit shown in Fig. 3. The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 3 is described with reference to Figs. 4A to 4F. In a state when no change occurs in any address bit or the chip select bit In this state, when either of the address bits, for example, A₁ , is changed so that a pulse ₁ falls from H to L at a time t₁ as illustrated in Fig. 4B, the NAND gate generates H so that node T₁ becomes H as shown in Fig. 4C, and the output 2 of the inverter formed by the transistors Q₃ and Q₄ becomes L. Therefore, the P channel transistor Q₇ turns ON so that the node T₁ is pulled up to V There is a possibility of generation of two or more pulses output at slightly different timings from the pulse generating circuits PG₀, PG₁, ... and PG Fig. 5 shows an example of one of the pulse generating circuits PG₀, PG₁, ..., except for the circuit PG The mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₄₆ , Q₄₈ , Q₅₈ and Q₆₀ are made to be relatively small. On the contrary, the mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₅₀ and Q₅₂ are made to be relatively large. Since the mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₅₀ and Q₅₂ are relatively large, the output pulse at the node T₃ falls rapidly in response to a change of an address bit applied to the input pad AP. Also, since the mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₄₆ , Q₄₈ , Q₅₈ and Q₆₀ are relatively small, the output pulse at the node N₃ rises a predetermined time later from the change of the address bit applied to the input pad AP. In more detail, for example, when the potential at the input pad AP is at H, then the node N₁ is L the node N₂ is H the transistor Q₄₆ is ON the node N₄ is H the node N₅ is L the node N₆ is H the transistor Q₄₈ is ON and, accordingly, the node N₃ is L and the output end T₃ is H. In this state, the node N₄ is H the node N₅ is L and the node N₆ is H and the transistor Q₅₂ is ON. From this state, when the address bit applied to the input pad AP turns to L, then the node N₁ becomes H the node N₂ becomes L the node N₃ becomes H and the transistor Q₅₀ turns ON. Because of its large gm, the output end T₃ rapidly turns to the L level. Also, the node N₄ turns to L, and the node N₅ turns to H. The transistors Q₅₈ and Q₆₀ turn ON in response to the H levels at the nodes N₅ and N₃ , respectively. However, since the mutual conductances of the transistors Q₅₈ and Q₆₀ are relatively small, the node N₆ gradually turns to the L level. Therefore, in response to the rapid operation of the transistor Q₅₀ , the output end T₃ rapidly turns to the L level in response to a fall of the applied address bit. When the transistors Q₅₈ and Q₆₀ turn ON, the node N₆ gradually turns to the L level so that the transistor Q₅₂ becomes OFF. Thus, a predetermined time later from the fall of the address bit, the output end T₃ rises again to the H level. The pulse width of the pulse obtained at the output end T₃ of the pulse generating circuit PG is determined by the values of the mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₅₀ , Q₅₂ , Q₅₈ , and Q₆₀. Similarly, when the potential at the input pad AP changes from L to H, a pulse having a pulse width corresponding to the difference in the mutual conductances gm of the transistors Q₅₀ , Q₅₂ and Q₄₆ , Q₄₈ is output at the output end T₃. Since the mutual conductances gm of the transistors can not be determined accurately in the manufacturing process, the pulse width of the pulse at the output end T₃ is relatively indefinite because the rising time is indefinite. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 4B by the arrows, the end of the pulse ₁ is indefinite. This is the reason why the pulse generating circuit CG including the circuit WC as shown in Fig. 2 is necessary. By the circuit shown in Fig. 2, a constant pulse width can be obtained regardless of the pulse widths applied from the pulse generating circuits PG₀ , PG₁ , ..., and PG Figure 6 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the pulse generating circuit PG The pulse generating circuits PG₀ , PG₁ , ..., and PG The clock signal generating circuit CG is not restricted to the circuit shown in Fig. 2. Various variations are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, the number of the CMOS inverters in the clock signal generating circuit may be arbitrarily selected in accordance with the desired output. If a pulse of H level is necessary, an additional inverter may be added. Is a clock signal must be generated in response to a change from L to H of an input signal, this is also possible to those skilled in the art based on the circuit shown in Fig. 2. Further, in place of connecting the node T₁ to the gates of the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄ , the output of the inverter formed by the transistors Q₃ and Q₄ may be connected through an additional CMOS inverter to the gates of the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄ , or the output end T₂ may be connected to the gates of the transistors Q₃₃ and Q₃₄. Still further, in place of the output end T₂ , the output of the CMOS inverter formed by the transistors Q₃ and Q₄ may be used as the output end of the clock signal generating circuit CG.
