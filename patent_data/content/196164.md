## Description
CTING THERMALLY DEVELOPABLE PRINTING COMPOST AND PRINT STOCK This invention relates to thermally developable printing inks which also function as protective coatings for recording papers and films, particularly for labels used on food packages in supermarkets, meat plants and similar environments. Thermally developable printing and coating compositions are known which resist premature color development, particularly when the paper or film coated with the composition is exposed to high humi dity. Such compositions are described in U. S. Patent 4,500,354 to Katsen et al and are also characterized by ability to generate sharply defined, high contrast indicia of enhanced clarity and permanence while avoiding or minimizing abrasion of and residue on the printhead after repeated printing. The printing and coating compositions of the patent contain a waterstable, phenol amine complex which is largely responsible for the improvements afforded by the compositions. In addition to the foregoing properties of stability and controlled color development and reduced printhead abrasion and contaminaton, thermallydevelopable print stock should also be resistant to conditions commonly encountered in meat packing plants, food distribution centers and retail merchandising operations such as supermarkets. For example, thermal labels carrying thermally developed trace indicia when applied to plastic film wrappings for food products must be resistant to water, alcoholic substances, vinegar and fats from the food product itself or from neighboring packages or the storage environment. Poor resistance may cause obscuring of the label indicia and lowered contrast between the label background and the thermal images, and may lead to interference with laser scannability of bar codes which may be imprinted on the label.Similar conse quences ensue upon migration of plasticizers from plastic wraps, migration of the pressure sensitive adhesive commonly employed on the labels, and migration of acidic substances in the paper. Such migration is often promoted by the stacking of food packages on one another, and contributes substantially to obscuring of the trace indicia on the label and to other degradation which interferes with visual or electronic reading. Complex systems have been devised to protect thermal labels against the aforementioned deleterious influences. In one such system, the paper base of the label has a protective layer on its front top side as a barrier against migration of acidic substances from the paper, a thermally developable coating over the protective layer and a transparent overlayer. In addition, the back under side of the paper has a protective layer in contact with the paper, a pressure sensitive adhesive over the protective layer, and a release liner in contact with the pressure sensitive adhesive. The protective layer on the back side operates as a barrier against migration of the adhesive onto the paper.The protective layers are intended not only to prevent substances within and on the label from migrating within the composite label but also to keep the thermal coating intact, both before and after developing, when aggressive substances such as water, alcohol, vinegar and fats may contact the label. Multi layered systems of the foregoing types are described in U, S. patents 4,388,362, 4,401,721 and 4,444,819. It will be apparent that production of such labels requires multi coating processes and equipment.Furthermore, each layer or coating must be dried before another is applied. These requirements make it difficult to produce a high quality label at reasonable cost. It has now been found that thermally developable print stock can be produced in a singlepass coating operation which not only exhibits the controlled color development, high contrast print capability and permanence of the recording papers ofU.S. Patent 4,500,354 but also provides outstanding resistance to migration of substances within the print stock and substances in packaged food environments, such as moisture, alcoholic compositions, vinegar, fats, and printing inks or resinous substances from labels of other packages in contact with print stock of the invention. In one aspect of the invention, a thermallydevelopable printing ink and self protecting coating composition is provided. This composition contains a chromogenic compound, a water stable phenol amine complex having limited water solubility, an alkaline, water soluble binder, and a polyfunctional aziridinyl crosslinking agent for the binder. In another aspect, the invention includes a thermally developable, environmentally protected print stock comprising a paper or polymeric film substrate coated with a mixture of a chromogenic compound, a water stable phenol amine complex, and a binder crosslinked with a polyfunctional aziridinyl compound. In still another aspect, the invention comprises an essentially single pass coating process for producing the aforementioned thermally developable, environmentally protected print stock, wherein a paper or a polymeric film substrate is coated with an aqueous dispersion of a chromogenic compound, a waterstable phenol amine complex having limited water solubility, an alkaline, water soluble binder, and a polyfunctional aziridinyl crosslinking agent for the binder, and the thus coated substrate is then dried. These and other aspects, features and advantages of the invention are further described and exemplified in the description which follows. The chromogenic materials used in the printing and self protecting coating compositions of the invention are any of the color producing materials which remain in the leuco or colorless form until reaction with a phenolic material under the influence of heat. A great variety of such chromogenic materials are known including the phthalide, naphthalide, fluoran and spiropyran compounds described inU.S. patents 4,500,354 and 4,097,288 and in the patents and other publications listed therein. All of such patents and publications are incorporated herein by reference. Typical of such chromogenic materials and preferred for use in the present invention are the following fluorans 3 N cyclohexyl N butyl 6 methyl 7 anil ino fluoran 3 N di butyl amino 7 chl oranil ino fl uoran 3 N dibutylam ino 7 fluo r anil ino fI uor an 3 N di butyl amino 6 methyl 7 anil ino fl uoran 3 N cycl ohexyl N methyl 6 methyl 7 anil ino fluoran 3 N cyclomethyl 6 methyl 7 anilino fluoran The foregoing fluorans provide black images.If blue images are desired, for scanning by red laser,Crystal Violet Lactone or similar blue dye may be used. The amount of chromogenic material is noncritical and generally is used in an amount of from about 1 to about 10 by weight of the total aqueous dispersion to be applied to the print stock, or in any other amount which will provide clarity and contrast. A preferred amount is about 3 6 wt. on the same basis. The phenolic component required for generation of color from the chromogenic material during thermal printing is present in the printing ink as a phenol amine complex. This complex is a crystalline polymeric material formed by reaction between a polyhydroxy phenol and an amine having a low boiling point, including both monoamines and polyamines. The phenols are those capable of forming complexes with amines in aqueous media and include such compounds as sulfonyl diphenol, thio diphenol, 4,4 dihydroxy sulfonyl diphenol, 2,2 hydroxy sulfonyl diphenol, 4,4 dihydroxy diphenylol propane, paraphenyl phenol, and the like, including any mixtures thereof. The amines typically are aliphatic primary or secondary monoamines , including any mixtures thereof, wherein the aliphatic group is alkyl or lower cycloalkyl lower meaning from 1 to 6 carbon atoms .Typical of such amines are n butyl amine, n propyl amine, cyclohexyl amine, ethylene diamine, diisopropyl amine and the like. The phenol and amine are reacted in proportions such that the resulting complex contains a ratio of hydroxyl groups to amino groups of greater than 1 1, preferably about 2 1, e.g., about 1.9 1 to about 2.05 1. Representative phenol amine complexes are those of the following formula HSo2 oa n0 R NH2 n 1 where is a phenylene group, substituted or unsubstituted, n is more than 1, e.g., 2 to about 30, preferably 5 20, and R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl group such as n butyl or cyclohexyl. Phenol amine complexes such as the foregoing are further described in U. S. Patent 4,500,354, incorporated herein by reference. The phenol amine complexes are added to the aqueous dispersions in amounts effective to provide at least one equivalent per equivalent of chromogenic compound. Preferably, however, an excess of the phenol amine complex is present in order to assist in stabilization of the chromogenic compound and the color resulting from thermal printing. Preferred aqueous dispersions therefor will contain a mole ratio of phenol amine complex to chromogenic material of greater than 1 1, for example 1.5 1, preferably 2 1. The third essential component of the printing and coating compositions is an alkaline, water soluble binder which assists in stabilizing the printing ink dispersion and binding the ingredients to the print stock. However, although the alkaline, water soluble nature of the binder enables it to be dispersed in the aqueous printing composition and to form a solid film on the print stock after drying, it has been found that the durability envisioned by the invention requires that the binder be crosslinked with a polyfunctional aziridinyl compound as described below. Otherwise, the print composition will smear or dissolve when contacted by moisture due to removal of the binder. Useful binder materials include both natural substances such as casein and synthetic polymers such as styrene maleic anhydride copolymers, acrylic acid copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers, styreneacrylic copolymers, polyacrylamides, vinyl acrylic copolymers and polyesters, all having functionality which is reactive with polyfunctional aziridines and thus being capable of crosslinking thereby.Typically, the crosslinkable functionality in the binder is carboxylic although some hydroxyl function ality may also serve as a basis for crosslinking.Preferred binders are casein and styrene maleic anhydride copolymers wherein the styrene maleic anhydride mole ratio is from about 1 1 to about 3 1. The carboxylic functionality of the foregoing binders may also be partially esterified. The binders are rendered alkaline and watersoluble by reaction with an alkali such as an amine, e.g., diethylamine, or ammonium hydroxide. Preferably, the binders are ammoniated to form ammonium salts. Upon drying of the aqueous printing ink dispersions on the print stock, the ammonia or amine is volatilized and the binder is crosslinked by the aziridine compound. The binders are utilized in the aqueous dispersions in amounts of from about 3 to 10 wt. , based on total dispersion weight, preferably about 4.5 to about 6.5 wt . Heavier stock such as cardboard will require higher concentrations of the binder. The e polyfunctional aziridinyl crosslinking agents also known as wpolyaziridinylw compounds are commercially available, water dispersible materials, such as the compounds disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,225,665 and 4,418,164, having the formula EMI11.1 where Y isEMI11.2 , R R is alkyl or hydroxyalkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R and R independently are hydrogen or methyl.Typical compounds are the following EMI11.3 trimethylolpropane tris B N aziridinyl propionate EMI11.4 trimethylolpropane tris B N 2 methyl aziridinyl propionate EMI12.1 pentaerythritol tris B N aziridinyl propionatel Other polyfunctional aziridinyl compounds may also be used provided they contain at least two groups which are crosslinkable with the binder, e.g., two aziridinyl groups rather than the three aziridinyl groups of the above listed compounds. The trifunctional compounds are commercially available under the designations XAMA 2 or XAMA 7 Cordova Chemical Company of Michigan and CX 100 Polyvinyl Chemical Industries .The polyfunctional aziridinyl compounds are used in amounts effective for crosslinking of the binder and for this reason will be present in the inks in an aziridinyl compound binder meq gram ratio of about 3.26 3.62 to 7.14 3.62. The use of ratios lower than about 3.26 3.62 results in contamination of printing heads by binder and other residues. The use of ratios of 7.14 3.62 or higher results in images showing a significant loss of optical density. Preferably, the ratio is about 3.4 3.62 to 3.75 3.62 and most preferably about 3.62 3.62.Generally, for the preferred aziridinyl compounds listed above, an amount of from about 3 to about 10 wt. based on total weight of the aqueous dispersion will be useful, for a dispersion containing a binder in the same range. Optionally, other ingredients may be added to the aqueous dispersion for enhancement of certain properties. For example, fatty acid amides are commonly added to such dispersions for melting point modification of the dried printing ink compositions.Typical fatty acid amides include behenic acid amide, arachidic acid amide, bis stearamide and any mixtures thereof. Other useful additives include fillers such as alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of fatty acids, solvents for the chromogenic compounds and phenolic developers such as C14 C21 aliphatic ketones, surfactants to assist in dispersion, optical brighteners, compounds for pH control, and potassium salts of polyester resins such as Alresat K 140, American Roechst to assist in preventing migration of acidic substances from the print stock to the printing composition. The aqueous print dispersions are conveniently prepared by first dispersing the binder in an aqueous medium, adding ammonium hydroxide to solubilize the binder, and then milling the resinous dispersion with the phenol amine complex, chromogenic compound, crosslinking agent and optional additives such as a fatty acid amide, potassium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide for pH control, dispersing aids such as a surfactant compatible with the other components of the dispersion, and a silicone type defoaming agent. If the coating composition is to remain in storage for any extended period of time, it may be advisable to add the aziridinyl crosslinking agent at time of use, to avoid premature crosslinking.The print stock is coated with the aqueous dispersion in any suitable manner, such as by blade coating, direct metering reverse rolling, Mayer rod coating, reverse gravure coating or air knife coating. Suitable print stock includes paper of various types machine glazed, machine finished paper or cardboard and polymeric films which are receptive to thermal printing inks. Typical of the latter are films having softening points of at least 200 C such as polycarbonate and certain polyester, polyamide, polystyrene and cellulose acetate butyrate copolymers. Following application of the printing ink dispersion, the coated substrate is air or oven dried, whereupon the binder material is crosslinked and forms, with the chromogenic components and phenolamine complex, a highly protective and thermallydevelopable coating. In one mode ofuse, the print stock of the invention is coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive to which a release paper is applied. The resulting recording paper or film is then ready for thermal printing in the production of labels for application to packaging film or paper in meat packing and other merchandizing operations. In another application, the print stock may be thermally printed initially and then affixed with a suitable adhesive directly to packaging film or paper. In still other applications, the print stock before or after printing may be laminated to a backing material, which may contain a magnetic material, for stiffening or further protection, or after printing may be laminated to transparent facing and or backing sheets for the production of credit cards, access control cards, magnetic tickets and the like.Numerous other uses of the print stock will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following examples will further illustrate the invention but are not intended to necessarily limit the scope thereof. In the examples and throughout the specification and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.

While continuing the agitation the behenic acid amide is added and the mixture is allowed to cool to 65 C. Thereupon, the fluoran dye is added and the mixture is sand milled for about 0.5 hour to a finely ground dispersion of 4 6 micrometer average particle size.The mixture is then filtered and the aziridine crosslinking agent added. Scale label face stock was prepared by blade coating the foregoing composition onto the smooth felt side of machine glazed or machinefinished paper at an application rate of 7 8 g m2 and oven drying the coated stock at a temperature profile of about 200 to 650C for about 8 to 10 seconds. The coated paper was then tested, along with samples of commercially available thermal papers and labels prepared in accordance with U.S Patent 4,500,354, for resistance to various substances commonly encountered in supermarkets and meat packing operations. The formulation of U.S.Patent 4,500,354 used for comparison was as follows, wherein the ingredients are the same as for the above formulation except as noted Parts Bv Weight Phenol amine complex 323 Behenic acid amide 250 Styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, sodium salt1 130 3 n cycl ohedyl n butyl 6 methyl 7 anilino fluoran 55 Polyester resin, potassium salt2 35 Defoamer3 14 20 Water 1400 1 Scripset 501 resin Monsanto Company 2 Alresat K 140 American Hoechst 3 SiliconeTest Procedures And Results a Resistance to water Pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive was applied to samples of the coated paper and the samples were thermally printed on a Hobart VIS VP bar code printer. The e optical density j O.D. of the label samples were measured.The samples were then immersed in water for 24 hours, air dried and optical measurements again taken to determine the effect of the water on the print quality. Since an O.D. 0 indicates perfectly black print quality, lower O.D. values reflectance indicate better print quality. Scannability of the bar codes by Lasercheck was also determined. Results are given in Table I. b Resistance to migration of pressuresensitive adhesive Background optical density measurements were made on coated paper samples of the invention immediately after application of pressure sensitive adhesive and after six months in storage. These results were compared with optical density measurements on samples from other sources similar to the water resistance test. The data is set forth in Table II. c Resistance to vegetable fat and oil The background and image optical densities of label samples prepared as in the water resistance test were measured and separate samples were then smeared with vegetable oil and fat. After 24 hours storage of the samples optical densities were again measured. Table III gives the results. d Resistance to migration of plasticizers Label samples were prepared and thermally printed with bar codes bars as in the water resistance test. Optical densities reflectances were then measured and the samples adhered to plasticized polyvinyl chloride WC wrapping film. After 72 hours of contact optical densities were again deter mined. The e measurements were expressed as percent contrast signal PCS , calculated as follows where R1 is reflectance of background and R2 is reflectance of the bars EMI20.1 The results Table IV give the percent contrast between the background and imaged characters retained by the samples e Resistance to vinegar Label samples were prepared as in the water resistance test and tested in the same manner except for substitution of vinegar for water.

As compred with the commercial products, the label stock of the invention exhibited an approximately equivalent initial optical density which about doubled after submersion as compred with approximate tripling in the cause of the Ricoh multi layered product and more than quadrupling in the cause of the Pitney Bowes product. Laser scannability remained at 100 as compared with 0 for the prior product and less than 100 for the commercial products.
