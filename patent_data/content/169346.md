# Dynamic memory cell and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A first semiconductor layer 43 of a P type is formed on a semiconductor substrate 41 of a P type and a mask layer 81 is formed on a portion of the first semiconductor layer 43 other than that area where a capacitor is to be formed. A hole 45 is formed in a direction of a thickness of the first semiconductor layer 43 , using the mask layer 81 . An N layer 47 is formed on the inner surface of the hole 45 with the mask layer 81 as a mask. An insulating film 49 for capacitor formation is formed on the inner surface of the resultant hole and on that area of the first semiconductor layer where the resultant dynamic memory cell is electrically separated from an adjacent dynamic memory cell. A conduc tive layer 53 acting as a capacitor electrode is formed on the capacitor formation insulating film 49 . With the conductive layer 53 as a mask, an impurity of an N type is doped into the first semiconductor layer 43 to form a second semicon ductor layer 57 of a P type in the surface portion of the first semiconductor layer 43 . A MOS transistor is formed in the surface portion of the second conductive layer 57 .
