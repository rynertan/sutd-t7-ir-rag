# Soil cultivating implements.

## Abstract
In a soil cultivating implement which comprises a row of power drivable soil working members 3 that extends substan tially horizontally perpendicular to the intended direction of opera tive travel A of the implement, means is provided to exert either an upwardly or a downwardly directed force upon that row of soil working members 3 and a hollow frame portion 1 which rotatably supports them. A supporting ground roller 15 lies behind the row of members 3 relative to the direction A and the axis of rotation 13 of the roller 15 is contained in an imaginary vertical plane A A . A mass in the form of a seed drill 32 or other mobile implement, tool or machine exerts a downward force on the soil cultivating implement at a coupling point 29, 30 and this downward force, in turn, exerts an upward force on the frame portion 1 at the front thereof by way of arms 8, 26 and strong pivots 7 which arms 8, 26 are turnable about the axis of rotation 13 of the ground roller 15 . The upwardly directed force assists the soil working members 3 in rising from the ground to ride over a rock or other buried obstacle without significant damage and alternative constructions are described and illus trated in which the point of application of the mass is adjustable to a location in advance of the plane A A so that the force acting on the frame portion 1 and soil working members 3 will be directed downwardly rather than upwardly. This can be of great assistance when heavy soil in a very hard condition is to be cultivated since it facilitates initial penetration of tines 5 of the soil working members 3 into the soil and tends to prevent them from riding upwardly out of the soil as cultivation continues. In one alternative embodiment, the mass is in the form of weights that are adjustably angularly displaceable around the axis of rotation 13 of the ground roller 15 to locations spaced at different distances from that axis 13 and to locations either behind, or in front of, the plane A A relative to the direction A .
