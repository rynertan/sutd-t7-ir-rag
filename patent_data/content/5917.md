## Description
The present invention relates to a method of combating weeds and certain compositions suitable for use in that method. The invention provides a method of combating weeds at a locus infested or liable to be infested with them, which method comprises applying to the locus an effective amount of a 2 ethoxy 2, 3 dihydro 3, 3 dir rethylbenzofuran 5 yl methanesulphonate, together or sequentially with b one or more of asulam Cor a salt thereof , benazolin, bensulide, bromofenoxim, brom.oxynil octanoate, chiortoluron, cyanazine, dichlorprop or a salt, ester or amide thereof, dinoseb acetate, dinoterb, ethalfuralin, flamprop isopropyl, glyphosate, isomethiozin, methabenzthiazuron, prometon, 2,4,5 T or a salt, ester or amide thereof, and N l ethylpropyl 2,6 dinitro 3 ,4 xylidine pendimethalin , or sequentially with c one or more of benefin, benzoylprop ethyl, bromDxynil, chlorfenDrop methyl, cyanazine, dicamsa, 2,4 D or a salt, ester or amide thereof, 2,4 DB or a salt, ester or amide thereof, difenzoquat, fenoprop, MCPA or a salt, ester or amide thereof, MCPB or a salt, ester or amide thereof, mecoprop or a salt, ester or amide thereof, neburon, perfluidone, picloram, simazine, 2,4,5 TP or a salt, ester or amide thereof, and 2,3,6 TBA or a salt, ester or amide thereof. All common names as used herein are as used in the PesticideManual, 5th Edition, 1977, issued by the British Crop ProtectionCouncil. In addition, the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a and Cc , said mixtures being synergistic. It has been found that a and Co or c seem to render weeds more susceptible to the action of the other, so that the present method is unexpectedly advantageous, especially when used in the control of weeds in grassland. The method can be used to combat a wider range of weed species than when a , b or Cc is used alone. Ccwponents a , b and Cc when used in cojtibination are also effective at lower dosage rates than those at which Ca , Cb and c alone are effective. Preferably, component b is the sodium or potassium salt of asulam, or is methabenzthiazuron, cyanazine or glyphosate. Each of the two essential components Ca and Cb or. c should desirably be present in an amount of from 1 to 99 by weight of the total amount of the two essential components which is applied.The 2 ethoxy 2,3 dihydro 3,3 dimethylbenzofuran 5 yl methanesulphonate is more preferably present in an amount of from IS to 95 , especially 25 to 90 , and particularly 50 to 80 , by weight of the total amount of the essential components which is applied. The optimum ratio of the two components depends, hcnqever, on the identity of component b or c . In the present method usually 0.1 6 kg, preferably 0.5 3.5 kg, and especially 0.9 2.1 kg, of component Ca are applied per hectare. At such rates of application, the preferred rates of application for the compounds constituting component Co or c are as follows Compound rate kg ha ComDound rate kg ha asulam 0.2 2.4 ethalfuralin 0.1 2.0 benazolin 0.05 1.5 fenoprop 0.05 2.0 benefin 0.2 2.0 flampropisopropyl 0.1 2.0 bensulide 1.0 20 glyphosate 0.2 5.0 benzoylprop 0.2 2.0 isomethiozin 0.5 4.0 ethyl MCPA 0.01 2.0 bromofenoxim 0.2 2.0 0.01 3.0 bromoxynil 0.05 1.5 mecoprop 0.01 3.0 bromoxynil 0.05 1.5 octanoate chlorfenprop 0.2 5.0 neburon 0.5 4.0 methyl perfluidone 0.5 4.5 chlortoluron 0.1 4.0 picloram 0.005 0.5 cyanazine 0.1 3.0 promethon 0.1 5.0 dicamba 0.1 0.5 simazine 0.1 2.0 2,4 D 0.01 2.0 2,4,5 T 0.05 2.0 2,4 DB 0.01 4.0 2,3,6 TBA 0.05 0.1 dichlorprop 0.01 4.0 pendimethalin 0.2 2.0 difenzoquat 0.2 2.0 dinoseb acetate 0.1 4.0 dinoterb 0.1 2.0 From the above, it may be seen that in general from 0.01 4 kg, preferably 0.1 2 kg, especially 0.2 1.5 kg of Cb or c are applied per hectare. component a may be applied as desired before or after component c . The essential components a and Cb or c cah be applied in compositions which can be prepared by admixing the ingredients.Usually the compositions are initially produced in the fomi of concentrates, e.g. containing 0.5 1 85 in toto of the essential components, and these are diluted with water or a hydrocarbon, usually water, for application, generally such that the concentration in toto of the essential components is 0.05 4 . The compositions normally contain a surface active agent and or a carrier. The carrier in the concentrate may be a solid, which may be finely divided. Examples of suitable solids are clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite and sepiolite, and synthetic solid carriers, e.g. silicas silicates and lignosulphonates. Mettable powders soluble or dippersable in water may be formed by admixing the essential herbicides with or without a carrier with a surface active agent. The carrier is preferably however, a liquid, e.g. water Ce.g. water used to dilute a concentrate for application . If water is employed as carrier in a concentrate, an organic solvent may also be present as carrier, though this is not usually employed. A concentrate containing water as carrier may advantageously also contain a surface active agent. The carrier nay be a liquid other than water, for example an organic solvent, usually a water irnt iscible solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C, in which the essential herbicides are dissolved or suspended. A concentrate containing an organic solvent suitable also contain a surface active agent so that the concentrates acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the herbicide art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin suiphonates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylaryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulDhonates or lower alkyl naphtalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated nanhthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the diallyl sulphosuccinates e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents for example condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alkyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g.sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quarternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates , salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoylN methyltauride, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. Where the components a and b or c are employed sequentially, component Ca is preferably applied before component b or c where that component is OT includes asulam, benazolin, benzoylprop ethyl, bromofenoxim, chlorfenprop methyl, dicamba, 2,4 D, 2,4 DB, dichlorprop, difenzoquat, fenoprop, flamprop isopropyl, MCPA, MCPB, mecoprop, picloram, 2,4,5 T or 2,3,6 TBA, and after component b or c where that component is or includes benefin, bensulide, glyphosate, methabenzthiazuron or perfluidine. Component a , whether as part of a mixture or in a sequential programme, is preferably applied in the low growth stage of the crop, i.e. in the autumn, winter or early spring. Where component b or c follows component a , b or c is preferably applied in the spring or early summer. A further herbicide can be used in the present method besides a and b or Cc . Thus, a further herbicide nay be applied with component a or component b or c , or separately. Usually the proportions of a to the further herbicide are from 1 10 to 10 1 by weight, preferably from 1 3 to 3 1 by weight. ExamDles of such further herbicides include phenoxyaliphatic acids or functional derivatives thereof, substituted ureas e.g. monuron, diuron, mono linuron, linuron, and benzthiazuron , triazines e.g. atrazine, trietazine, promtryne and metamitron , INOC, PCP, ioxynil, dichlobenil, paraquat, dalapon, TCA, barban, EPTC, butylate, diallate, allidochlor, propachlor, brornacil, lenacil, maleic hydrazide, aminotriazole, trifluralin, S,S,S tributyl phosphoro trithiolate, 3 1 ethoxyamino propylidene 6 ethyl 2H pyran2,4 3H dione, phenmedipharn, azolamid, triallate, propamide, carbetamide, diphenamid, pebulate, benfluralin, metobromuron, pyrazon, N chloracetyl N 2,6 diethylphenyl glycine ethyl ester or N phosphonomethyl glycine, especially phenmedipham, lenacil, pyrazon, dalapon or TCA. Fertilizers or pesticides other than herbicides can also be employed with the present essential herbicides. The present method may be employed on plants, the soil, land or aquatic areas. The method may be employed against a wide range of weeds, e.g. Polygonus spp, mayweeds e.g. Alatricaria spp. and Anthemis spp , chickweed Stellaria media , charlock Sinais arvensis , blackgrass CAlopecurus myosuroides , Poa Annua, volunteer cereals and Avena fatua. The present method is preferably used for selectively combating weeds at a locus in which a crop is growing or is to grow. The crop in which the present method most advantageously employed to combat weeds is preferably grass, including turf, but it may be employed in other crops, including sugar beet, red beet, fodder beet, mangolds, onions, tobacco and sunflowers, provided that component b or c is safe to the crop concerned.
