# OPTICAL ABSOLUTE ENCODER.

## Abstract
An optical absolute encoder for detecting the rotational angle and rotational position of a motor or the like has a rotary symbol plate and a fixed plate. The rotary symbol plate has a plurality of concentric code patterns constituted by light transmitting portions and light screening portions which are positioned alternately, and a reference pattern constituted only by a light transmitting portion which is interposed bet ween adjacent code patterns, concentrically with the code patterns. The fixed plate has first and second groups of code pattern slits arranges in the radial direction of the rotary sym bol plate at a first predetermined distance to correspond to the code patterns, respectively, and a reference patterns light transmitting portion disposed at a position corresponding to the reference pattern and separated from the center line of the code pattern slit groups by a second predetermined distance. This prevents any variation in voltage level of a reference signal due to light leakage.
