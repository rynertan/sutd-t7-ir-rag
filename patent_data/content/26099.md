# Dynamoelectric machine with cryostable field winding.

## Abstract
A superconductive rotor of a dynamoelectric machine comprising a rotor shaft, a support rim, a plurality of slot teeth 86 formed at the outer periphery of said rim, said teeth located between rotor slots, and a plurality of slot assemblies, one within each rotor slot. Each slot assembly comprises a plurality of stacks 72 of superconductors 60 , each super conductor within a stack having insulation 74 on only two of its sides and being disposed one on top of another in a gener ally radial direction relative to the rotor shaft a plurality of insulative separators 73 , one between each pair of stacks a top insulative strip 79 and a bottom insulative strip 80 , respectively radially above and below said conductor stacks and a side panel 77 on either side of the slot assembly and next to a slot tooth. Cooling channels are disposed on the surfaces of the separators.
