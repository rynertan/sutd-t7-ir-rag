# Charged particle energy spectrometer.

## Abstract
A charged particle energy spectrometer, typically an electron spectrometer, comprising an electrostatic disper sive charged particle analyser, e,g. a substantially hemis pherical sector analyser 1,6 , and a detector means compris ing a plurality of charged particle detectors 26 28 is described. Fringing fields at the exit of the analyser are corrected by a fringing field corrector plate 7 containing a plurality of apertures 20, 22, 23 each aligned with one channel of the detector means. Exit beam defining slits 21, 24, 25 in a plate 12 situated in the exit focal plane of the analyser may optionally be provided. Each aperture 20, 22, 23 is preferably the same size and shape as the single aperture used to achieve optimum correction of the fringing fields in a conventional spectrometer having a single channel detector. One or more position sensitive detectors may be used in place of some or all of the detectors 26 28 .
