# Fastening device and method of securing a flexible sheet to a support.

## Abstract
A fastening device for attaching a sheet 16 of flexible material to a support 12 and comprising a first part 10 mountable on the support 12 and a second part 14 engageable with the first part 10 characterised in that the second part 14 is attachable to the sheet 16 of material and is configured so as to be movable relative to the first part 10 when they are engaged, and in that the first part 10 is adapted to move relative to the support 12 whereby a force applied to the two engaged parts 10, 14 moving them in one direction relative to the support 12 causes the second part 14 to move relative to the first part 10 generally transversely with respect to said one direction.
