# A process for welding aluminium based elements and a welded assembly.

## Abstract
An assembly of elements 1 and 2 made of aluminium or an aluminium based alloy is produced by introducing between the elements 1 and 2 an intermediate metal 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and laser welding them together. An alloy layer including the intermediate metal is formed in a weld zone between the elements and this exhibits neither cracks nor voids and so produces an airtight seal.
