## Description
The present invention relates to novel compounds, chromogenic composition, elements and methods useful to detect hydrogen peroxide or analytes which react to produce hydrogen peroxide. This invention is particularly useful in clinical chemistry, i.e. in the assay of biological fluids. The detection and quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide and compounds yielding hydrogen peroxide as a result of chemical or enzymatic reactions are of importance in many areas. For example, they are important in the detection of hydrogen peroxide produced in the enzymatic assay of chemical or biological substances sometimes called analytes such as glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, lipase, triglycerides, creatine kinase, etc. in the presence of oxygen. The quantity of analyte present in a test sample is determinable from the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced and detected. Known compositions for detecting or quantifying hydrogen peroxide in such assays generally comprise a substance having peroxidative activity, e.g. peroxidase, and a material which undergoes a detectable change e.g. oxidation to a color dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and the peroxidative substance. Various materials which undergo such a detectable change include monoamines, diamines, phenols, leuco dyes and other known dyes or dye formers. Hydrogen peroxide detection has also been accomplished by the reaction of a color forming coupler and an oxidizable color developing compound, e.g. 4 aminoantipyrine in the presence of peroxidase. Color forming couplers which have been used for this purpose include N substituted anilines, such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,396,714. Although the dye providing materials of the prior art are, in general, useful as indicators for hydrogen peroxide determination, there are instances when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to be analyzed is too low to produce sufficient detectable color from such indicators. In some instances, this shortcoming can be overcome by using increased amounts of dye providing materials. However, where the analyte concentration is initially low, or where high dilution of the test sample is required, such materials may still provide insufficient detectable color in such instances. Such a problem of low analyte concentration is particularly acute when analyte determination is attempted with known dry analytical elements. In such instances, the indicator or reagent layer present in such elements is very thin, and the dye providing material concentration is necessarily low. Hence, the density of the color formed from low level analytes, or even from abnormally low concentrations of high level analytes, can be rather low. However, it would be desirable to use such elements to assay for analytes present at low concentrations. The present invention provides a means for determination of hydrogen peroxide or analytes which react to produce hydrogen peroxide. The problems of known assays are overcome with a chromogenic composition for the determination of hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquid which comprises a color forming coupler, and an oxidizable color developing compound which is capable of reacting with the coupler in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a substance having peroxidative activity to produce a color dye. The composition is characterized in that the color forming coupler has the structure wherein R is a monovalent group containing one or more phosphono, quaternary amino, sulfonium or phosphonium groups, or esters or salts thereof, R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ are independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, halo, amino or R, and Z represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a N substituted 5 or 6 membered fused substituted or unsubstituted ring. This invention also provides a dry analytical element for the determination of hydrogen peroxide or an analyte which reacts to produce hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquid. This element comprises an absorbent carrier material and is characterized as containing a chromogenic composition comprising wherein R is a solubilizing group, R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ are independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, halo, amino or R, and Z represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a N substituted 5 or 6 membered fused substituted or unsubstituted ring. Further, a method for determining hydrogen peroxide or an analyte which reacts to produce hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquid comprises the steps of in the presence of a compound having peroxidative activity, physically contacting a sample of the liquid with the element described above containing the chromogenic composition to produce a color dye, and detecting that dye. The present invention further provides the use, in an analytical determination, of a color forming coupler of the structure wherein R is a monovalent group containing one or more phosphono, quaternary amino, sulfonium or phosphonium groups, or esters or salts thereof, R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ are independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, halo, amino or R, and Z represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a N substituted 5 or 6 membered fused substituted or unsubstituted ring. This use of the particular color forming couplers described herein in analytical determinations overcomes the deficiencies of known color forming couplers. The couplers described herein can be advantageously used to detect low concentrations for example, less than 0.3 millimolar of hydrogen peroxides or analytes which react to produce hydrogen peroxide in both solution and dry assays. These color forming couplers are particularly useful for the determination of hydrogen peroxide generated by one or more that is, coupled or uncoupled enzymatic reactions in response to an analyte such as glucose, galactose, amino acids, uric acid, lipase, triglycerides, cholesterol or creatine kinase. The color forming coupling compounds useful in the practice of this invention are N substituted quinoline or indole compounds or saturated counterparts which have at least one solubilizing group attached to the nitrogen atom of the quinoline or indole ring. The compounds can otherwise have one or more other substituents as long as the dye forming capability of the compound is not impaired. In particular, the useful heterocyclic compounds can be represented by the structure wherein R is a solubilizing group, e.g. a monovalent group containing one or more sulfo, hydroxy, carboxy, phosphono, quaternary amino, sulfonium, phosphonium and like charged moieties, or equivalent esters or salts thereof for example, alkali metal salts . For example, R can be alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl or pentyl , cycloalkyl, preferably of 5 to 10 carbon atoms for example, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl , or aryl, preferably of 6 to 10 carbon atoms in the nucleus for example, phenyl, Preferably, R is alkyl substituted with one or more sulfo, hydroxy, carboxy or phosphono moieties or equivalent esters or salts.

Most preferably, R is wherein m is 1 to 5. One or more hydrogen atoms of the alkylene chains in these preferred R groups can be replaced with other solubilizing or non solubilizing groups, as described in the preceding paragraph.

Z represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a N substituted 5 or 6 membered fused ring for example, forming an indole, quinoline, dihydroindole or tetrahydroquinoline ring . This fused portion of the ring can be saturated or contain one unsaturated carbon to carbon double bond. It can have one or more substituents including, but not limited to, the groups defined for R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ above. Preferably, Z completes a saturated portion of the ring. More preferably, it represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a saturated 6 membered fused ring that is, forming an N substituted tetrahydroquinoline . Preferred fused ring substituents include halo and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the fused ring is saturated and unsubstituted. In certain embodiments, color forming couplers of this invention are represented by the structure shown above wherein R is defined as having one or more phosphono groups or equivalent esters or salts. Preferably, in such embodiments, R is wherein m is 1 to 5, and R₅ and R₆ are independently hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 5 carbon atoms as defined above. More preferably, R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ in the illustrated structure are independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms or halo, and Z represents the carbon atoms necessary to complete the nucleus of a N substituted 6 membered fused ring as described above. Preferably, this fused ring portion is saturated. One or more of the hydrogen atoms of the alkylene chain of the R group can be replaced with a solubilizing or non solubilizing group as described for R in general above. Examples of color forming couplers useful in the chromogenic compositions of this invention include the following. The compounds identified with are preferred. The last three listed compounds are representative novel phosphono containing color forming couplers. The λ In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a compound having peroxidative activity defined below , the described color forming coupler reacts with an oxidizable color developing compound to produce a color dye. Any of a number of such color developing compounds can be used in this invention, including but not limited to 2 aminoantipyrine, 4 aminoantipyrine, 2 thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide, benzidine and its homologs, 3 methyl 2 benzthialinone hydrazone, The color dye forming reaction can be illustrated by the following representative reaction The color forming couplers useful in this invention can be prepared by any of a number of synthetic methods. In general, they can be prepared by reacting a reduced quinoline or indole with an alkylating agent which contains the R moiety. This agent reacts with the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic ring, replacing a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. For couplers containing an N sulfoalkyl substituent, the compound is preferably prepared by reacting a reduced quinoline or indole with a sultone in a suitable solvent or with an appropriate halogenated alcohol which is subsequently converted to an N sulfoalkyl substituent. Specific details of the preparation of preferred color forming couplers are given below. Other useful preparatory methods are generally described in U.S. Patent 4,282,144 and in references mentioned therein. The color forming couplers of this invention having N phosphono substituents are generally prepared by reacting a reduced quinoline or indole with a brominated phosphonate compound in a suitable solvent. Specific details of the preparation of useful N phosphono color forming couplers are given below in Examples 1 and 2. The chromogenic composition of this invention can be used in both solution and dry element assays. It can optionally comprise a substance having peroxidative activity or a buffer which maintains the pH of the composition in an aqueous environment at from 4 to 11. Substances having peroxidative activity useful in the practice of this invention are also known as peroxidative substances and are capable of catalyzing the oxidation of another substance by means of hydrogen peroxide or another peroxide. Such substances include natural and synthetic peroxidases, cytochromes, hemin, forms of hemoglobin, alkaline hematin, iron sulfocyanate, iron tannate, tungstic acid and its salts, molybdic acid and its salts and chromic salts. Peroxidase is a particularly useful peroxidative substance. Substantially any buffer can be used in the composition of this invention which maintains the composition at a pH which is conducive to dye formation as well as to the reactions required for a given assay. Generally, the pH is maintained within the range of from 4 to 11, but a specific pH will depend on the particular analyte being assayed and the reagents used therein. For example, when a fluid is assayed for uric acid using uricase, the composition pH is generally maintained between 8 and 9. When a fluid is assayed for glucose using glucose oxidase, the composition pH is generally maintained between 4 and 7. Useful buffers for various assays include carbonates, borates, phosphates, malates, maleates, glutarates, the tris materials, e.g. tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, and others known in the art. The chromogenic compositions of this invention can be prepared for use in a solution assay by mixing the color forming coupler with the oxidizable color developing compound. Additional materials can be mixed in as well. The details of preparing and using representative chromogenic compositions are given in Examples 3 and 4 below. When the chromogenic compositions of this invention are used in solution assays, generally the color forming coupler is present in a concentration of up to 10 ³ molar, and preferably from 5 x 10 ⁵ to 5 x 10 ⁴ molar. The oxidizable color developing compound is present in an amount sufficient to react with the coupler. For example, it is generally present in an amount up to 10 millimolar, and preferably from 0.5 to 2 millimolar. The useful amounts of the optional composition components for example, buffer, surfactant or peroxidative substance are known to a skilled worker in the art. The chromogenic composition of this invention can be used to determine an analyte which is capable of producing hydrogen peroxide that is, an analyte which can participate in a reaction or series of reactions which produce hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquid such as a biological fluid for example, human or animal whole blood, blood serum, plasma, feces, spinal fluid or urine . This composition can be used with the appropriate interactive composition a reagent or combination of reagents which produces hydrogen peroxide upon interaction with the analyte during the assay. The interactive composition can be mixed with the chromogenic composition either prior to or during the assay. Analytes which can be determined in this manner include glucose, triglycerides, uric acid, lipase, cholesterol, galactose, amino acids, creatine kinase, and others known to one skilled in the clinical chemistry art. For example, to determine uric acid, the interactive composition is uricase. To determine cholesterol, the interactive composition includes cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol ester hydrolase. Other interactive compositions can be fashioned for a given analyte by one skilled in the art. The amounts of the reagents suitable for a given assay are known to one skilled in clinical chemistry. In the context of this disclosure, determination means either qualitative that is, merely detection , semi quantitative or quantitative analysis. The method of this invention is adaptable to both solution and dry element assays. In a solution assay, generally the chromogenic composition is physically contacted and mixed with a liquid test sample in a suitable container for example, a test tube, petrie dish, beaker or cuvette . The resulting solution is incubated for a relatively short time, e.g. about 5 minutes, at a suitable temperature for example, about 37 C . The sample is then evaluated by measuring the amount of dye provided upon reaction of the color forming coupler with color developing compound in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The amount of dye can then be correlated to the amount of hydrogen peroxide either initially present in the sample, or produced as a result of the presence of an analyte. Such an evaluation can be done visually or with suitable colorimetric detection equipment and procedures. The color forming coupler and color developing compound can be provided as part of a diagnostic test kit for either dry or solution assays. For solution assays, the kit components can be supplied as lyophilized reagents in individual packets having predetermined amounts. Alternatively, they can be provided in bottled or otherwise packaged solutions sufficient in size for one or more assays. Other reagents or non reactive addenda can also be supplied in the kit along with suitable assay utensils or containers for performing the assay, if desired. A dry analytical element described below containing one or more reagents necessary for an assay can also be included as part of a diagnostic test kit. The method of this invention can also be utilized with a dry analytical element which contains an absorbent carrier material, i.e. a thin sheet of a self supporting absorbent or bibulous material, such as filter paper or strips, and contains the chromogenic composition of this invention. Preferably, such elements also contain a peroxidative substance. Such elements are known in the art as test strips, diagnostic elements, dip sticks, diagnostic agents and the like. When employed in dry chemistry elements, the composition of this invention can be incorporated into a suitable absorbent carrier material by imbibition, impregnation, coating or other suitable technique. Useful absorbent materials are insoluble and maintain their structural integrity when exposed to water or physiological fluids such as urine or serum. Useful elements can be prepared from paper, porous particulate structures, porous polymeric films, cellulose, wood, glass fiber, woven and nonwoven fabrics synthetic and nonsynthetic and the like. Useful materials and procedures for making such elements are well known in the art as exemplified in U.S. Patents 3,092,465, 3,802,842, 3,915,647, 3,917,453, 3,936,357, 4,248,829, 4,255,384, and 4,270,920, and 4,312,834, and U.K. Patent 2,052,057. Preferably, the dry analytical elements of this invention have at least one porous spreading zone as carrier material. This zone can be self supporting that is, composed of a material rigid enough to maintain its integrity , but preferably it is carried on a nonporous support. Such a support can be any suitable dimensionally stable, and preferably, transparent i.e. radiation transmissive material which transmits electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength between about 200 and about 900 nm. A support of choice for a particular element should be compatible with the intended mode of detection reflection or transmission spectroscopy . Useful support materials include paper, metal foils, polystyrene, polyesters for example, poly ethylene terephthalate , polycarbonates and cellulose esters for example, cellulose acetate . The porous spreading zone can be prepared from any suitable fibrous or non fibrous material or mixtures of either or both. The void volume and average pore size of this zone can be varied depending upon the use intended. For example, if whole blood or other liquid samples containing high molecular weight materials are to be assayed, the void volume and average pore size are generally greater than if serum or urine is to be assayed. Useful spreading zones can be prepared using fibrous materials, either mixed with a suitable binder material or woven into a fabric, as described in U. S. Patent 4,292,272. Alternatively, and preferably, the spreading zone is prepared from polymeric compositions for example, blush polymers or particulate materials, with or without binding adhesives, as described in U. S. Patents 3,992,158 and 4,258,001. Other useful spreading zone materials are described in W. German OLS 3,150,102 and Japanese Patent Publication 57 1982 101760. It is desirable that the spreading zone is isotropically porous, meaning that the porosity is the same in each direction in the zone as created by interconnected spaces or pores between particles, fibers, polymeric strands, etc. The elements can have more than one zone, e.g. one or more reagent zones, spreading zones, registration zones, mordant zones, radiation blocking or filter zones, subbing zones, barrier zones, buffer zones, etc. The zones are generally in fluid contact with each other meaning that fluids, interactive composition and reaction products e.g. color dyes can pass between superposed regions of adjacent zones. Stated in another manner, fluid contact refers to the ability to transport components of a fluid between the zones in fluid contact. Preferably, the zones are separately coated superposed layers, although two or more zones can be a single layer, or a zone can contain two or more separate layers. Besides the references noted above, suitable element formats and components are described, for example, in U. S. Patents 4,042,335, 4,132,528, and 4,144,306. The chromogenic composition of this invention, or any of its components, can be incorporated in any of the zones of the elements that would be suitable for the particular analysis. The location of other reagents or addenda can be any suitable zone as is known by a worker skilled in the clinical chemistry art. In the elements of this invention, the amounts of the color forming coupler and other reagents can be varied widely depending upon the analyte to be determined. Generally, the color forming coupler is present in a coverage of up to 3, and preferably from 0.2 to 1 g m². The peroxidative substance can be present in a coverage within the skill of a worker in the art. For peroxidase, for example, the coverage is generally up to 150,000, and preferably from 40,000 to 60,000 I.U. m². The oxidizable color developing compound is generally present in a coverage of up to 2, and preferably from 0.2 to 1 g m². A variety of other desirable, but optional reagents and addenda can be present in the element in amounts known to one skilled in the art. In the context of this application, I.U. represents the International Unit for enzyme activity required to catalyze the conversion of 1 µmole of substrate per minute under standard pH and temperature conditions for the given enzyme. One embodiment of this invention is a multilayer dry analytical element for determining an analyte. This element comprises a support having thereon, in order and in fluid contact, a hydrophilic registration layer containing a hydrophilic binder material natural or synthetic , such as gelatin or polyacrylamide, and a spreading layer containing 1 an interactive composition which produces hydrogen peroxide upon interaction with the analyte, 2 a substance having peroxidative activity, and 3 the chromogenic composition as described above. This element can also have a radiation blocking layer between the registration and spreading layers. This layer generally contains a reflective pigment e.g. titanium dioxide or barium sulfate in a suitable hydrophilic binder e.g. gelatin . In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the element spreading zone comprises glucose oxidase which interacts with the analyte glucose, a peroxidative substance e.g. peroxidase , an oxidizable color developing compound e.g. 4 aminoantipyrine , a suitable buffer which maintains the pH in the range of from 4 to 7 during the assay e.g. when spotted with a 1 100 µl whole blood sample , and a color forming coupler as described herein. The coverage of the reagents in the glucose determining element described above is well within the skill of the worker in the art. For example, glucose oxidase is generally present in a coverage of up to 80,000, and preferably from 40,000 to 60,000, I.U. m². The peroxidative substance e.g. peroxidase is generally present in a coverage effective to provide up to 80,000, and preferably from 40,000 to 60,000. I.U. m². The aminoantipyrine oxidizable compound is generally present in a coverage of up to 2, and preferably from 0.2 to 1 g m². The color forming coupler is generally present in a coverage of up to 3, and preferably from 0.2 to 1 g m². In another embodiment of this invention, a cholesterol assay utilizes a spreading reagent zone containing cholesterol oxidase, a nonionic surfactant or a protease, cholesterol ester hydrolase, a peroxidative substance e.g., peroxidase , an oxidizable color developing compound e.g. 4 aminoantipyrine , a suitable buffer which maintains the pH in the range of from 4 to 7 during the assay, and a suitable color forming coupler as described herein. A variety of different elements, depending on the method of assay, can be prepared in accordance with the present invention. Elements can be configured in a variety of forms, including elongated tapes of any desired width, sheets, slides or chips. The assay of this invention can be manual or automated. In general, in using the dry elements, hydrogen peroxide or other analyte determination is made by taking the element from a supply roll, chip packet or other source and physically contacting it with a sample e.g. 1 100 µl of the liquid to be tested. Such contact can be accomplished in any suitable manner, e.g. dipping or immersing the element into the sample or, preferably, by spotting the element by hand or machine with a drop of the sample with a suitable dispensing means. After sample application, the element is exposed to any conditioning, such as incubation, heating or the like, that may be desirable to quicken or otherwise facilitate obtaining any test result. Determination of hydrogen peroxide or other analyte is achieved when the oxidized color developing compound reacts with the color forming coupler to provide a detectable color dye. This dye can be detected with the unaided eye or with suitable spectrophotometric means and procedures.

The dry analytical elements used in these comparisons had the format and composition of the element described in Example 3 except for the difference in color forming coupler. Samples of human whole blood containing differing amounts of glucose were assayed with samples of each element Examples and Controls by spotting a 10 µl aliquot of each sample on the spreading reagent layer of the element. After three minutes at room temperature, the reflection density D This example compares the use of a quinoline color forming coupler to the use of a toluidine color forming coupler in a solution uric acid assay. Uric acid is an analyte which is commonly present in low concentrations in human sera. An enzyme solution was prepared by diluting 40 mg of uricase 0.3 I.U. mg and 3 mg of peroxidase 1237 I.U. mg to 8 ml with 0.01 molar borate buffer pH 8.7 . Two chromogenic compositions comprising 45 mg of 4 aminoantipyrine and either 42.9 mg of N ethyl N 2 sulfoethyl toluidine Control or 41.3 mg of N sulfopropyltetrahydroquinoline Example 9 , respectively, were prepared. Each composition was diluted to 10 ml with 0.01 molar borate buffer pH 8.7 . A stock uric acid solution was prepared with 1.6 mg uric acid in 10 ml of dilute potassium carbonate. The assay was carried out by mixing 0.1 ml of each chromogenic composition with 0.1 ml of the enzyme solution and various amounts of the uric acid stock solution shown in Table IV below to form assay solutions. Borate buffer was added to each assay solution which had a volume less than 0.3 ml in order to bring the volume up to that level. The reagents in each assay solution were allowed to react for about 10 minutes, after which 3 ml of borate was added. The optical density of each assay solution was measured, at 555 nm for Example 9 and at 553 nm for the Control. The results are provided in Table IV below. The data reflect the subtraction of optical densities of blank assay solutions i.e. no uric acid present . It can be seen from the data that the composition of the present invention provides consistently significantly greater optical density over the Control composition. This improvement can be particularly advantageous in the determination of very low concentrations e.g. less than 0.3 millimolar of hydrogen peroxide or of analyte which can react to produce hydrogen peroxide.
