# Fixed field inductor type generator and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
In a fixed field inductor type generator having an annular stator core 2 on which an armature coil 1 is wound and a field coil 7 which is disposed stationary in said stator core 2 , the field coil 7 is located in space defined by a pair of rotat able paw like magnetic poles 4a, 4b that are opposed to each other and are supported by a rotary shaft 6 . The field coil 7 is held by a holding member 9a, 9b made of a non magnetic metal and is secured to the stator core 2 . The field coil holding member 9a, 9b has fixed collars 13a, 13b in the circumference thereof, which are plastically fastened to the in ner peripheral surtace of the stator core 2 via a metallic coup ling member 20 . The field coil 7 has been wound on a curved spring steel plate 8 and receives the expanding force at all times from the inner peripheral side thereof. The field coil 7 is contained in the field coil holding member 9a, 9b and is firmly supported by an adhesive that is charged thereinto.
