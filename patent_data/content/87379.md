# Casting a metal single crystal article using a seed crystal and a helix.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of epitaxially casting single crystal metal articles 32 in molds 34 , which comprises causing the solidification interface velocity vector to rotate through at least 90 degrees, preferably 180 540 degrees, about the axis of overall directional solidification growth 54,56 . In addi tion, a mold section 46 has a small passageway configured to prevent line of sight communication between the portion where the seed is contained and the article portion of the mold. Preferably, the passageway is shaped like a helix of 0.8 1.5 turns. A second seed 40 can be formed in the mold of an article made from a first seed 36 , and used to make a second casting. The invention reduces the normal increase in crystallographic variability which would otherwise be associ ated with such practice.
