## Description
This invention relates to a monoclonal antibody to human protein C, a hybridoma which produces the monoclonal antibody, a method of producing the monoclonal antibody from the hybridoma, and to a method of determining or separating human protein C by utilizing an antigenantibody reaction between the monoclonal antibody and protein C. Protein C which has recently aroused interest as a control factor on coagulation and fibrinolytic systems is a vitamin K dependent plasma protein, one of gamma carboxyglutamic acid Gla containing proteins, and is known to show strong anticoagulating activity and fibrinolysis promoting activity see Kisiel, et al.,Biochemistry, 16, 5824 5831 1977 and P. C. Comp C.T. Esmon J. Clin. Invest., 68, 1221 1228 L977 . Human protein C is produced in the liver. It is the product of gamma carboxylation of glutamic acid Glu existing in the vicinity of the amino terminal of a human protein C precursor formed in the liver to Gla gamma carboxylglutamic acid in the presence of vitaminK. The resulting human protein C is thereafter secreted in the blood. In the blood, most of it exists as a two chain structure composed of an L chain having a molecular weight of 21,000 and an H chain having a molecular weight of 41,000, and has a Gla domain containing 9Gla residues at the L chain amino terminal. It is known that the Gla domain has a calcium binding site, and when a calcium ion Ca binds to this site, the protein C undergoes conformational change, and this change is important in the manifestation of activity in vivo see N. L. Esmon et al. J. Bil. Chem., 258, 5548 5553 1983 1. When vitamin K is deficient or an antagonist of vitamin K warfarin, dicoumarol, etc. is administered, the gamma carboxylation of the human protein C precursor does not proceed. In this case, Glu in the vicinity of the amino terminal of the human protein C precursor is not converted to Gla, but secreted in the blood. Such a protein secreted in the blood which has the same structure as the human protein C precursor will be abbreviated as PIVKA PC which means protein C as protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists. Since PIVKA PC does not have a completed Gla domain as in protein C, it does not completely undergo Gla dependent change in steric structure even in the presence of a calcium ion Ca , and is not biologically active. For this reason, PIVKA PC is treated as an abnormal protein in a living organism.No method has previously been available for measuring or determining PIVKA PC and protein C having a Gla domain discriminatingly by using a monoclonal antibody. Since human protein C has a short half life in a living organism, the effects of the absence of vitaminK and the administration of a vitamin K antagonist tend to appear early. Furthermore, unlike other Gla containing coagulating factors prothrombin, FVII, FIV and FX which act on the proceeding of coagulation, protein C has the action of inhibiting coagulation. Hence, to determine PIVKA PC and normal protein C discriminatingly becomes a very useful parameter in determining the state of absence or deficiency of vitamin K or effects of administering a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin and dicumarol . On the other hand, a monoclonal antibody has recently gained widespread acceptance in analysing the function and structure of an antigen protein or in immunoassay such as enzyme immunoassay E.I.A. or radioimmunoassay RIA because it has the advantage that it is specific to a single antigen determinant and antibodies having the same specificity can be stably produced. For the functional analysis and molecular analysis of an antigen protein, it will be an effective means to find out an antibody which recognizes a site involved in the function of the antigen protein, or a special structural site. Monoclonal antibodies to human protein C as an antigen protein have been proposed Blood Vessel, 1984, vol. 15 NO. 2 pages 171 174 J. Biochem., vol. 97, No.1, 1985, pages 127 138 and Japanese Laid Open PatentPublication No. 120,825 1985 . These documents disclose 13 monoclonal anntibodies to human protein C in total.Six out of these bind to the L chain of protein C five, to the H chain of protein C and two recognize an area between the L chain and H chain of protein C. J. Biochem., vol. 97, No. 1, 1985, pages 127 138 states at the end Of the present antibodies produced, some might be conformation specific antibodies directed toward the metal ion dependent structure of the protein . This, however, is a speculation, and this paper does not describe the fact that such conformation specific antibodies were actually obtained. Such a fact has neither been reported subsequently. In addition, the binding sites of the above 13 monoclonal antibodies to human protein C are sites common to protein C and PIVKA PC. Accordingly, by these monoclonal antibodies, protein C and PIVKA PC cannot be measured or determined distingwishably. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a novel monoclonal anibody to human protein C. Another object of this invention is to provide a monoclonal anibody to human protein C which specifically recognizes human protein C in the Gla domain. Another object of this invention is to provide a monoclonal antibody to human protein C which specifically recognizes human protein C in the Gla domain which has undergone change in conformation by a calcium ion. Another object of this invention is to povide a monoclonal antibody to human protein C which can distinguishably recognize protein C and PIVKA PC having no completed Gla domain as in protein C. Another object of this invention is to provide a hybridoma which produces the aforesaid monoclonal antibody of the invention. Another object of this invention is to provide a method of separating and recovering the monoclonal antibody from the product of the aforesaid hybridoma. Another object of this invention is to provide a method of determining human protein C which comprises determining the content of human protein C in a mixture containing human protein C through an antigen antibody reaction using the monoclonal antibody of the invention. Another object of this invention is to provide a method of capturing human protein C by contacting a mixture containing the human protein C with the monoclonal antibody of the invention fixed to an insoluble carrier by utilizing the property of the monoclonal antibody of the invention to recognize specifically human protein C binding the calcium ion. Further objects and advanvatages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. According to this invention, the above objects and advantages of this invention are achieved firstly by a monoclonal antibody to human protein C which does not recognize human protein C not binding a calcium ion at the Gla domain but recognizes human protein C binding a calcium in at the Gla domain. According to this invention, the monoclonal antibody to human protein C in accordance with this invention can be produced by separating and recovering a monoclonal antibody to human protein C from the product of a hybridoma capable of producing a monoclonal antibody to human protein C which does not recognize human protein C not binding a calcium ion at the Gla domain but recognizes human protein C binding a calcium ion at the Gla domain. The present invntion also provides the aforesaid hybridoma and a process for producing a monoclonal antibody using the hybridoma. The hybridoma cells capable of producing the monoclonal antibody of this invention can be obtained by a method known as the Kohler Milstein method lKohler BR Milstein Nature, 256, 495 497 1975 . Specifically, mice are immunized with human protein C, and the spleen cells are extracted from the immunized mice. The spleen cells are then fused with mouse myeloma cells. The resulting hybridoma cells are systematically examined and screened against an antibody reacting with human proteinC fixed to microtiter plates. The examination is carried out both in the presence of a calcium ion Ca and in the absence of a calcium ion. By selecting those hybridoma cells which prove to be positive only in the former reaction in the presence of a calcium ion are selected, and isolated. These hybridoma cells synthesize an secrete the desired antibody. The monoclonal antibody of this invention is obtained from a product produced by these novel hybridoma cells, and acts monospecifically on a specific antigen determinant on the human protein C molecule in the presence of a calcium ion. A specific process for producing the monoclonal antibody in this invention will now be described in detail.A. Isolation and purification of an antigen Human protein C used as an antigen is isolated from a human plasma and purified by the method of Suzuki et al., J. Biol. Chem., 258, 1914 1920 1983 B. Immunization of a mouse with human protein C Female Balb C mice may be used, but mice of other strains may also be used. The immunizing plan and the concentration of human protein C should be selected so as to form a sufficient amount of antigenically stimulated lymphocytes. For example, a mouse is immunized intraperitoneally with 50 micrograms of human protein C three times at 2 week intervals, and finally 30 micrograms of human protein C is administered intravenously.Several days after the final immunization, the spleen cells are extracted from the animal for fusion.C. Cell fusion The spleen was aseptically taken out from the immunized mouse, and a suspension of the spleen cells was prepared. The spleen cells are fused with mouse myeloma cells from a suitable cell line in the presence of a suitable fusion promotor. The preferred ratio of the spleen cells to the myeloma cells is from about 20 1 to about 2 1, and a fusion medium is suitably used in an amount of 0.5 to 1.5 ml per about 108 spleen cells. The mouse myeloma cells used for cell fusion are well known. In the present invention P3 X63 Ag 8 Ul cells P3 U1 see D. E. Yelton et al., Current Topics inMicrobiology and Immunology, 81, 1 L978 1 are used. The fusion promoter is preferably polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 1000 to 4000. Other fusion promoters known in the art can also be used. In the present invention, polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 1540 is preferably used.D. Screening of the fused cells In a separate container such as a microtiter plate , a mixture composed of the unfused spleen cells, unfused mouse myeloma cells and the fused hybridoma cells are diluted with a selective medium not supporting the unfused mouse myeloma cells, and cultured for a period sufficient to kill the unfused mouse myeloma cells about 1 week . A culture medium having drug resistance for example, resistance to 8 azaguanine and not supporting the unfused mouse myeloma cells, such as HAT medium, is used. In the selective medium, the unfused myeloma cells die. Since the unfused spleen cells are untransformed cells, they die away after a certain period of time 1 week . The fused cells, on the other hand, can survive in the selective medium since they have both the tumoral nature of the parent cells of myeloma and the nature of the parent spleen cells. E.Determination of human protein C After the hybridoma cells have thus been detected, the culture supernatant is sampled and screened for an antibody to human protein C by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . The assay is carried out by adding CaC12 in a certain concentration to the culture supernatant, an enzyme labelled antibody solution and a washing solution, and also in the absence of Caul2. By selecting those hybridomas which prove to be positive only in the presence of Caul2 are selected. These hybridomas produce and secete an antibody which does not recognize human protein C in the absence of a calcium ion but recognizes human protein C in the presence of a calcium ion.F. Cloning of the hybridoma cells producing the desired antibody and the production of the antibody The hybrodima cells capable of producing the desired antibody are cloned by a suitable method such as a limiting dilution method, and the desired antibody can be produced by the following two different methods.According to a first method, the hybridoma cells are cultured in a suitable medium for a certain period of time, and the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cells can be isolated from the supernatant of the culture. According to a second method, the hybridoma cells are injected intraperidoneally into a syngenic mouse. After a certain period of time, the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cells can be isolated from the blood and ascites of the host animal.G. Separation of human protein from the human protein C containing mixture The monoclonal antibody of this invention, as stated above, has the property of not recognizing human protein C in the absence of a calcium ion Ca but specifically recognizing human protein C in the presence of a calcium ion Ca By utilizing this property, human protein C can be easily separated from a mixture containing human protein C for example human plasma . For this purpose, the monoclonal antibody to human protein C is first fixed or bound to an insoluble carrier. The insoluble carrier used at this time may be any of those which are generally used as substrates for assay reagents or kits based on the use of monoclonal antibodies. For example, the insoluble carrier may be produced from such a material as Sepharose, polyacrylamide, cellulose, dextran, a maleic acid polymer or mixtures of these. The insoluble carrier may be in various forms such as a powder, granules, pellets, beads, a film or a fiber. Generally, it is advantageous to use plates having many depressions wells used for assaying or separating plasma or its fractionated components. When the fixed monoclonal antibody is brought into contact with a mixture containing human protein C in the presence of a calcium ion Ca , human protein C is bound to the fixed monoclonal antibody and thus captured. As required, the human protein C captured by the fixed monoclonal anibody is separated by washing it with an aqueous solution containilng a calcium ion together with the carrier to which it is fixed to thereby remove the remainder of the mixture, and then treating the fixed monoclonal antibody with an aqueous medium substantially free from a calcium ion. Thus, the separating method in accordance with this invention permits removal of human protein C from a mixture containing human protein C, separation of human protein from the mixture and its purification, and measurement of the content of human protein C in the mixture by very simple operations. For example, the content of human protein C having a Gla domain in a mixture containing it can be determined by using the monoclonal antibody to human protein C in accordance with this invention, and inducing an antigen antibody reaction between them, preferably in the presence of a calcium ion.Furthemore, the amount of Gla deficient protein C PIVKA PC may be determined by combining the content of human protein C determined by the above method with the results of measurement of the amount of entire protein C by an immunological technique such as the EIA, RIA or the Laurell method using a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a site having no relation to a Gla dependent steric structural change a polyclonal antibody or an antiserum. The following Excamples illustrate the present invention more specifically. In these Examples, proteinC will sometimes be abbreviated as PC. EXAMPLE 1 Two female Balb C mice 4 weeks old were immunized with purified human PC four times at 14 day intervals. The first immunization was effected by intraperitoneally administering to the mice a mixture emulsion of 50 micrograms of human PC dissolved in phosphate buffer saline PBS and an equal volume of completeFreund s adjuvant in an amount of 0.5 ml head. The second and third immunizations were effected by intraperitoneally administering to the mice a mixture of 50 micrograms of human PC and Freund s incompete adjuvant.The final immunization was carried out by administering a BPS solution of 30 micrograms of human PC from the tail veins of the mice. Three days after the final immunization, the spleen cells of the immunized mice were used for cell fusion. The spleen cells of the immunized mice and myeloma cells P3U1 of a mouse of the same strain were mixed in a ratio of from about 2 1 to about 15 1 and fused in the presence of 50 polyethylene glycol 1540 a product of Wako Pure Chemicals, Co., Ltd. in accordance with the method of Roller and Milstein. The fused cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 FCS so that the concentration of the cells became 1 x 106 cells ml. The suspension was distributed to the wells of a 96 well microplate Coster in an amount of 100 microliters per well. The fused cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator 5 CO2, 37 C . After one day, a medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine HAT media was added to each well, and a half volume of the medium in each well was removed and the HAT medium was added to each well every second or third day. Thus, hybridoma cells composed of the spleen cells and the myeloma cells were screened. The antibody in the supernatant of the culture of the hybridoma cells was detected by the ELISA method using a microtiter plate coated with human PC as an antigen. As a second antibody, an alkaline phoaphataselabelled rabbit anti mouse IgG antibody was used, and to determine the difference of the bonding of human PC to the antibody in the presence of calcium ion from that in the absence of calcium ion, TBS 0.02M Tris HCl, 0.14MNaCl, pH 7.4 containing 5 mM CAY12 was added to one supernatnat from one well, and TBS was added to another supernatant from same well. Furthermore, TBS containing 5mM CaC12, 0.05 Tween 20 0.02 NaN3, or TBS 0.05t Tween 20 0.02 NaN3 was used as a diluent for the second antibody and a washing buffer. In 541 wells in total in which the fused cells were plated, the formation of colonies was observed in 523 wells. Out of these, 44 wells were found to be positive in antibody production as shown in Table 1 below. Forty four wells showed bonding to human PC in the presence of a calcium ion, and 32 wells showed bonding to human PC in the absence of a calcium ion. These positive wells were cloned twice by the limiting dilution method. The resulting clones were suspended in 90 FCS 10 DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. The monoclonal antibodies produced by the individual clones were proliferated in the abdominal cavities of Balb C mice. Human PC was isolated from the ascites of the mice and purified by using a proteinA Sepharose 4B column. Table 1 Number of wells in which the fusion cells were plated 541 Number of wells which formed colonies 523 Number of wells which produced antibodies 44 Bonding to PC in the presence of Ca was positive 44 BondigS to PC in the absence of Ca was positive 32 EXAMPLE 2 IgGs of the individual clones purified from the mouse ascites were examined for subclasses, the effect on human PC activity, binding activity to the L chain orH chain, and binding activity to human PC whose Gla domain was removed by an enzyme treatment using alphachymotrypsin. The subclasses were determined by the Ouchterlony method using anti mouse antisera specific to the individual classes. The effect on human PC activity was determined by flixing IgG and human PC in a mole ratio of 5 1, incubat i the mixture overnight at 4 0C activating human PC by a thrombin thrombomodulin complex, and meauring the humanPC activity by measuring the decomposition activity of a synthesis substrate. As the synthesis substrate,EMI12.1 in which Val represents optically active D valine, Leu represents optically active fi leusine, and Arg represents optically activeL arginine a product of Kabi Vitrum AB of Sweden designated as S 2266 . The binding activity to the L chain or H chain was determined by subjecting human PC to electrophoresis under reducing conditions, followed by immunoblotting using a nitrocellulose membrane and HRP labelled goat anti mouse IgG. The Gla domain removed human PC was prepared by limited hydrolysis using alpha chymotrypsin in accordance with the method of Esmon et al. N. L. Esmon et al., J.Bio. Chem., 258, 5548 5553 1983 i, and by immonoblotting, its bondability to the antibody was determined. The properties of the antibodies produced by the six clones are summarized in Table 2. The calcium ion dependent antobidies all bound to the fl chain, and even in the presence of a calcium ion did not bind to hnaan PC from which the Gla domain was removed. These antibodies were shown to bind to the calcium ion and recognize only that human PC which underwent conformation change dependent on the Gla domain.

Method A The plama samples and a standard plasma sample were each diluted with 0.05M Tris HCl pH 7.4 0.l5M NaCl TBS containining 1 BSA and distributed to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with the antibody 6C3 capable of binding to the H chain of PC and blocked with 1 BSA.The plate was incubated at 37OC for 3 hours and the wells were washed with 1 BSA TBS 0.05 Tween 20. 1251 labelled calcium dependent PC antibody 7B12 diluted with 1 BSA TBS containing 5mM CaC12 was added. The plate was incubated at 37 0C for 3 hours, and the wells were washed with 1 BSA TBS 0.05 Tween 20 supplemented with 5mM CaC12. The wells were then counted by a gamma counter. Method B The procedure of method A was repeated except 125 that 125I labelled rabbit anti human PC antibody was used as the 125 labelled second antibody. The results of measurements are shown in the accompanying drawing. In the plasma samples taken from the normal healthy persons, the patients with protein C deficiency and the patients with liver disease, the measured values obtained by the methods A and B well agreed with each other, and the correlation coefficient was Y 0.99. In the case of the plasma samples from the patients administered with warfarin, the measured values obtained by the method A were lower than those obtained by the method B. This shows that Gla deficient PC PIVKAPC which did not undergo conformational change dependent on Gla even in the presence of a calcium ion was secreted in the blood The amount of the Gla deficient PC PIVKAP can be taken as the difference between the two measured values obtained by the methods A and B. In the drawing, the circular marks show the measured values of the samples from the normal healthy persons the square marks, the measured values of the samples from the patients with liver disease the triangular circles, the measured values of the samples from the patients with protein C deficiency and the black circular marks, the measured values of the samples from the patients administered with warfarin. EXAMPLE 4 Measurement of the amount of PC antigen before and after administration of warfarin Protein C in plasma samples taken before and after the administration of warfarin was measured by the same two methods A and B as in Example 3. Table 3 show the results of measurements in two cases. In the two cases, the amount of protein C before the administration of warfarin was in the normal range, and the measured values by the two methods A and B well agreed with each other. But after the administration of warfarin, the protein C level evidently decreased. The amount of PC measured by the method A after administration was one half of that by the method B or less. This shows that the administration of warfarin decreased the amount of protein C secreted in the blood and the Gla deficient protein C PIVKA PC was secreted.

After the coupling buffer was removed by sucking, the gel was immediately added to 2 ml of a solution of antibody 6H2 in a coupling buffer 3 mg ml and suspended. The suspension was shaken gently overnight at 4 Pc. The gel was then transferred to 1M ethanolamine HCl pH 8.0, 2 ml and shaken at room temperature for 2 hours to block the remaining active site. After the blocking, the antibodycoupled Sepharose gel was washed alternately with 0.lM acetate buffer pH 4.0 containing 0.5M NaCl and 0.lM borate buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.5M NaCl on a glass filter.When the absorbance of the filtrate at 280 nm reached less than 0.01, it was equilibrated with 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.05M Tris HC1 pH 7.4 , and packed into a column. Affinity chromatography was carried out using the anti human PC monoclonal antibody 6H2 coupledSepharose 4B column so prepared. 2 Adsorption of protein C on the antibody coupled Sepharose 4B and its elution Eight milliliters of a 1M BaC12 solution was added to 100 ml of a human plasma, and the mixture was stirred at 4 0C for 1 hour. The precipitate was collected by centrifugal separation and washed with 0.lM NaCl containing 5mM of BAC12 and 5mM benzamidine and then dissolved in 0.2M EDTA pH 7.4 containing 15 ml of 5mM benzamidineto obtain a barium adsorbed fraction.The barium adsorbed fraction was dialyzed against 0.05MTris HCl pH 7.4 containing lmM benzamidine, and aCaC12 solution was addded to that the final concentration reached SiaM. The mixture was charged onto the antibody 6H2 coupled column equilibrated with 0.05MTris HCl containing 5mM Caul2 and lmM benzamidine. The column was washed with 0.05M Tris HCl containing 5mM CaC12, lmM benzamidine and 1M NaC1, and eluted with 0.0sol Tris HCl containing 50mM EDTA and lmM benzamidine. A single peak containing PC was obtained. PC in the fraction eluted from the antibody Sepharose 4B was purified to an extent as high as about 52 times that in the barium adsorbed fraction, and the recovery ratio of PC was about 48.2 .
