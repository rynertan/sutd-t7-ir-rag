# Steering linkages and vehicles incorporating them.

## Abstract
A steering linkage for a pair of wheels with upright pivot axes A is comprised of links and pivots. Torque can be applied to each wheel via pivotal connection C to an intermediate link 1 when control links 2 are pivoted about their fixed pivots F by a drive applied through a tiebar 3 . Each wheel can be rotated about its pivot axis by at least 180 , and the turning circles of the wheels have a common centre which, when the wheels are steered, describes a line parallel to the line which joins the pivot axes of the wheels. In a four wheeled vehicle the described line is coincident with the rotational axes of the second set of wheels.
