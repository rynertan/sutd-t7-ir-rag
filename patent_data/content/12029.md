# Solid state imaging device.

## Abstract
A solid state imaging device of a picture element con struction made up of photodiodes consisting of an N type semiconductor substrate 21 , a P type well region 22 formed in the main surface of said semiconductor substrate, and an N type region 26 formed in said well region, and vertical switching insulated gate field effect transistors 13 which utilize said N type region as either the source or the drain. A voltage from a source 18 used to develop a video signal across a resistor 19 is also applied to the substrate 21 at a terminal 30 to reduce defects in the resulting picture.
