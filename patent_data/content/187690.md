## Abstract
A flow tester valve apparatus includes a housing 62 having a flow passage disposed therethrough, with a flow valve disposed therein for opening and closing the flow passage. A power mandrel is disposed in the housing and includes a power piston 156A . The power mandrel is operatively associated with the flow valve for moving the flow valve from its closed position to its open position. A power port 192 transmits pressure from a well annulus to a first side of the power piston. The power piston includes a main piston 400 and a booster piston 402 . The booster piston initially acts with the main piston to provide a force for moving the power mandrel, but after limited initial move ment, the booster piston makes no further contribution.
