# Parabolic reflector antenna with optimal radiative characteristics.

## Abstract
Radiowaves antenna basically consisting of a parabolic reflector and a feed, able to radiate according to mode TE₁₁, or according to the combination of modes TE₁₁ and TM₁₁, characterized in that, in case of radiation according to mode TE₁₁, said reflector has a ratio f D between the focal distance f and the maximum diameter D comprised between 0,46 and 0,50 and said feed has a ratio α between the aperture radius a and the central wavelength τ of the utilized frequency band comprised between 0,52 and 0,60 also characterized in that, in case of radiation according to the combination of modes TE₁₁ and TM₁₁, a direct and linear proportionality is defined between said ratio f D of the reflector and said ratio α of the feed.
