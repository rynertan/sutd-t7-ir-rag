## Description
X PAY INTENSI YING SCREEN BASED ON A TANTALATE PHOSPHOR AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PHOSPHOR This invention relates to the preparation of a luminescent material and to the use of the material inX ray intensifying screens.Background Art X ray intensifying screens are generally used in conjunction with photographic film and serve to enhance the image formed on the film. Phosphors which are the active components of such screens should be clear, colorless, single phase materials, crystallizing in polyhedr l shape of well defined habit so as to minimize any scattering of the light generated by the X rays. Generally, the phosphor particle size should be about 3 to 10 um and the surface area should be about 0.075 to 0.300 m2 g. Moreover, the phosphors should be good absorbers of X ray radiation of the energy used, they should emit light strongly in the region of the spectrum to which the film is sensitive, and they should provide sharp, undistorted film images. While there are many known matorials which exhibit luminescence, few have the combination of properties necessary to make them useful in X ray intensitying screens. For example, the most widely used phosphor for X ray intensifying screens for many years has been calcium. tungstate it is the standard by which other phosphors are judged.In recent years several other phosphors have been proposed for possible use in X ray intensifying screens, but the number is smail compared to the total number of phosphors which have been discovered. Blasse and Bril J. of Luminescence 3, 109 1970 describe the cathodo and photo luminescent properties of various YTaO4, GdTaO4 and LuTaO4 phosphors, Including those in which some of the tantalum is replaced by niobium or some of the yttrium is replaced by rare earth substituents. These materials all havo the fergusonite M type structure.It has been recognized that these materials have to polymorphs, a monociinic 12 space group structure M at low temperatures and a tetragonal scheelite type structure with space group I42 at high tempera turves. Transition between these two forms is instantaneous and rextersible. G, M. Molten andA. B. Chase The American Mineralogist 52, 1536 1967 report that this transition occurs at 1325 C in YTaO4. They also disclose a new polymorph of yttrium tantalate and related rare earth tantalates if the material is crystallizd below the transformation temperature, a different monoelinic strueture calied M1 phase, with space group P2 a results, which M1 phase can be converted to the M phase by heating above 1400 C and then cooling to below 1325 C. It is believed that there ns s no prior at on the luminescent properties of the M1 phase materials under ultraviolet or X ray exaitation.

Figure 5 shows the comparison of the luminescent emission spectra under X ray excitation for M1 type YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 and CaWO4.Figure 6 shows a cross section of a typical X ray Intensifying screen. Figure 7 snows plots of resolution V3. total phosphor coating weight for X ray screen pairs of the instant invention and for X ray screen pairs prepared in a similar manner from CaWO4.Figure 8 shows the calculated X ray absorption for the screen pairs of the instant inven tion and for those of CaWO4, the screen thicknesses being selccted so as to give the same resolution, Figure 9 shows plots of relative speed vs. resolution for X ray screen pairs of the instant invention and the screen pairs of CaWO4 prepared in a similar manner.Description of the Invention It has been discovered that certain substituted yttrium, gadolinium and lutetium tantalates, which crystallize in a monoclinic M1 structure, show improved X ray to light conversion efficiencies, compared, to those of the hosts, to those of moncclinicM structure compositions of the same formula and to those of the commonly used conmercial phosphor CaWO4. Moreover, it has been found that substitution of appropriate amounts of niobium for tantalum significantly enhances the blue fluorescence of M1 structureYTaO4 and LuTaO4 that substitution of appropriate amounts of thulium for yttrium significantly enhances the blue fluorescence of YTaO4 and that substitution of appropriate amounts of terbium for yttrium, lutetium and gadolium in M1 structure YTaO4, LuTaO4 and GdTaO4 results in strong green fluorescence. According to the present invention therefore there is provided an X ray intensifying screen which includes a phosphor as the active component characterised in that the phosphor comprises a tantalate having the monoclinc M1 structure and having one of the following general formulae a YNbxTal xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.15 b LuNbxTal xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.2 c Yl yTmyTaO4 where y is 0 to about 0.03 d Yl yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15 e Lu1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15 f Gd1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15. Certain of than tantalates defined above may be used in the form of solid solutions as phosphors in X ray intensifying screens, specifically solid solutions of the tantalates a and b or a and c or solid solutions of at least two of the tantalates d e and f . As described in more detail hereinafter, according to modification of the invention, in cortian of the above tantalats, a part of the yttrium, lutetium or gadolinium may ba replaced with lanthanium or ytterbium or a part of the yttrium or lutetium may be replaced with gadolinium.This may be advantageous in some circumstances. The blue or green rluorescing luminescentsubstituted phosphor used in this invention has the monoclinic M structure and is selected froi the aroup consisting of a YNbxTa1 xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.15 b LuNbxTa1 xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.2 c Y1 yTmyTaO4 where y is 0 te about 0.03 d a solid solution of a and b e a solid solution of a and c f Y1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15 g Lu1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15 h Gd1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15 and i a solid solution of at least two of f , g and h The luminescent phosphor is useful In X ray intensifying screens. The blue fluorescing phosphor used in this invention includes a the Nb containing yttrium tantalate of the formula YNbxTa1 xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.15, preferably about 0.001 to about 0.15. more preferably about 0.02 to about 0.10, most pieferably about 0.05 b the Nb containing lutetium tantalate of the forniula LuNbxTa1 xO4 where x is 0 to about 0.2, pre ferably about 0.005 to about 0.2, more preferably about 0.02 to about 0.05 c the Tm containing yttrium tantalate of the formula Y1 yTmyTaO4 where y is 0 to about 0.03, pre ferably about 0.001 to about 0.03, more preferably about 0,002 to about 0.01, most preferably 0.005 d a solid solution of a and b and e a solid solution of a and c . The green fluorescing phosphor used in this invention includes a the Tb containing yttrium tantalate of the formula Y1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0. 15, preferably about 0.005 b the Tb containing lutetium tantalate of the formula Lu1 yTbTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15, preferably about 0.005 c the Tb containing gadolinium tantalate of the formula Gd1 yTbyTaO4 where y is about 0.001 to about 0.15, preferably about 0.03 to about 0.035 and d a solid solution of at least two of a , b ajd c . The phosphor used in this invention has the monoclinic M1 structure wich P2 a space group symmetry, and exhibits greater luminescence than related materials having the monoclinic M structure with I2 space group symmetry. Differences in physical characteristics of M and M1 phase crystals make the two materials easily discernible. The Mphase crystals made by the aforesaid previously described, known solid state procedure grow in irregularly shaped pieces, whereas the M1 phase crystals made by the p ocess of this invention grow n regular, nearly polyhedral particles or narrow si distribution. This difference can be seen in the scanning electron mlcrographs of the two types of materials depicted in Figures la and lb .TheM material Figurelb has a surface area of 1,3 m2 g and t particle size of 0.5 m. The M material Figure la has a surface area of G.l9 m2 g and a particle size of 4.2 m. The surface areas reported herein were reasured via krypton or nitroe gas absorption in a Macromuratics surface pore volume analyzer.The particle sizes, unless otherwise noted, were calculated from the measured surface areas using the formulaEMI7.1 tb Particle SEP size SEP pt SEP SEP Ensitp SEP 6 tb SEP Surface SEP area SEP mi SEP x SEP tb Unit cell parameters obtained from single crystal X ray diffractometer measurements show that the b axis and unit cell of the M1 phase are approximately half those of the M phase. X ray powder diffraction patterns sho marked differences, as seen from the comparison of the patterns shown inFigure 2 for M type YTaO4 and M1 type YTaO4. Differences in the crystal structure of the two phases also affect the Raman spectra as shown in Figures 3a and 3b depicting M typc YTaO4 and M1 type YTaO4, respectively. The invention process provides the M1 type lumines ent material defined above, uniform, colorless, single phase particles having a surface area of about 0.75 to 0.300 m2 g a particle size of about 3 to 10 m, which material can be directly incorporated into an X ray intensifying screen without additional processing. The invention process consists of first blending stoichiometric quantities of appropriate oxides from the group Ta2O5, Y2O3, Gd2O3,Lu2O3, Nb2O5, Tm2O3, Tb2O3 and Tb4O7, in a Spex oscillating type shaker, for about 1G to 20 minutes.This mixture, in a container which is inert to the ingredients at process conditions, i Is then prefired in air at about 1000 C to about 1200 C for about 10 to 14 hours. The container can be of a noble metal.but alumina is preferred because of its lower cost.The prefired material is then mixed with a flux comprising Li2SO4, pure LiCl or a BaCl2 LiCl eutectic see C. Sandomini, gazz. Chim. ital., 44I, 383 1914 , with the weight of the flux equalling 1 5 to 1 2 of the total weight nf the miyture The resultant mixture is then fired for at least about 3 hours s to about 24 hours or more at a temperature of about 1100 C to less than about 1450 C, such as about 1100 C to about 1300 C. The luminescent product is recovered by water leaching, filtering and washing and then dried.The partIcle sze and uniformity of the phcsphor, made according to this process, is shots in the scanning electron micrograph depicted in Figure la, Alternatively to the above, the prefiring step can be omitted, particularly when Li2S04 is used as the flux, and the appropriate oxides which a.re b ended and mixed directly with the flux can be fired as indicated above. Without prefiring, longer firing times, for example, at least about 4 hours to about 14 hours or more, are preferred and advantageous. The luminescent product is formed in theM1 phase by crystallizing the mixture below about 1450 C. Therefore, care must be token to fire the mixture below this temperature. As indicated above, a firing temperature of about 1100 C to about 1300 C is used, with a temperature of about 1200 C being preferred. The invention herein provides X ray intensifying sereens wherein the phosphor of the screen is as defined above. Especially surprising is the performance of the phosphor with the M1 structure when used in ar. X ray intensifying screen.It shows an emission efficiency which is superior to compositions of the same formula but of theM structure it also is superior to CaWO4. When used in an X ray intensifying screen the phosphor converts X radiation into photons which are more readily captured by a photographic emulsion to provide a permanent record. The first step in this conversion prccess is the absorption of X rays by the phosphor. Figure 4 shows the calculated fraction of X rays absorbed b 185 m layers of M1 type YTaO4, GdTaO4 and LuTaO4 and of CaWO4 the latter employed as a standard for comparison herein over the X ray energy range commonly used in radiography. It ray be seen thpt or this thickness, which 15 typical of thephosphor content of pairs of screens commonly used, the tantalate screens of this invention offer improvedX ray absorption. The second step of this cnonversion process is the emission of light fluorescence . In many applications it is desirable to have higher efficiency of emission than that shown by CaWO4 in order to reduce the X ray exposure required to form a radiogram. The efficiency of light emission is indicated by the area under curves such as shown in Figure 5 where the luminescent emission spectrum A of a preferred composition YNb0.05Ta0.95O4, under X ray excitation, is shown along with, for comparison, the luminescent emission spectrum B of a commercial CaWO4 X ray phosphor, under the same conditions of excitation and measurement. The phosphor used in this invention silows a more intense emission pattern. The emitted light must be captured on the film.Photographic emulsions most commonly used in medical X ray applications show a generally uniform response to radiation in the range 350 to 400 nm. Beyond 400 nm sensitivity becomes progressively lower it virtually disappears beyond about 470 nm. YTaO4 and the Nb and Tm containing compositions herein show strong blue band emission and peaks around 400 nm and are m ore effective, when used with conventional film, than CaWO4. LuTaO4 and the Nb containing compositions also show strong blue band emission. Tb containing compositions ofYTaO4, GdTaO4, LuTaO4 and solid solutions thereof show strong green emission around 500 nm, thus making them effective with X ray film which is sensitive to such radiation. In a typical X ray intensifying screen the powdered phosphor composition, as a thin layer, is adhered to a flexible support, such as cardboard or a polyester film, by means of a polymeric binder. The phosphor binder composite can contain about 85 to about 96 phosphor, by weight. The phosphor layer is typically coated onto the support at a wet thickness of about O.005 Inch 0.0127 cm to about 0.050 inch 0.127 em . The phosphor layer composition can be prepared, using common dispersion techniques, in any conventional binder. This is usually accomplished by ball milling the phosphor, binder, solvent and other adjuvants for an appropriate period of time. The procedures and useful binding agents are fully described in the pricr art, for example, U.S. Patents 2,648,013 2,819,183 2,907,882, 3,043,710 and 3,895,157. Optionally, it is frequently desi able to overcoa the phosphor layer with a thin, transparent F o tive layer, to permit lsaning. üseful protective layers are also described in the prior art, uch as the aforesaid United States patents. It is sometimes also desirable first to coat the flexible support that is, beneath the phosphor with a light reflective layer, such as a white pigment, to further intensify the light output of the screen.Reflective layers are well known in the X ray screen art. Those such as discloced in U.S. Patents 3,043,710 and 3,895,157 are particularly eful. In actual use the phosphor coated sheets re usually pressed against both sides of a photographic film with emulsion on each side. Such a pack with phosphor coatings adjacent to photographic emulsion coatings is held in a film cassette for X ray exposure. Figure 6, a cross section of o t anX ray intensifying screen of this invention, shows the support 1, the reflective layer 2, the phosphor layer 3 and the protective coating t. Conventional supports which can be used include cardboard, suit bly sized or coated, for example, with saryta, cellulose, acetate propionate, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate. poly vinyl chloride or vinyl acetate , polyamide, metal sheeting, for example, aluminum, and poly ethylene terephthalate , the latter being a preferred support. For us in anX ray intensifying screen, the support must be perme able to X rays. The support may have, for example, n thickness of about 0.00025 inch 0.00064 cm to about 0.30 inch 0.76 cm , with films having a thickuess up to about 0.02 inch 0.05 cm being prefcrred. The choice of screen thickness ganerally involves a trade off between variables such as resolution and image noise. Thin screens have the advantage of high resolution, but suffer from high Image noise which is due in part to tho fact that they absorb a smaller fraction of the incident X rays. Figure 7 shows the relationship between resolution and total phosphor coating weight for CaWO4 and forYNb0.03Ta0.97O4 when a pair of screens is used to image blue sensitive, Cronex 4 X ray Film with a conventional X ray unit operating at 80 KVp, 2 mAs.Surprisingly, the YNb0.03Ta0.97O4 screen pair provides a superior result since, for the same resolution, a substantially higher coating weight can be used. This results in much higher X ray absorption, and hence lower image noise, for the same resolution. For example, a pair of Cronex Par intensifying screens made with CaWO4 has a phosphor content equivalent to pure CaWO4 having a thickness of about 84 m. Commercial type screens made with YNb0.05Ta0.95O4, and having the same resolution, contain the equivalent of phosphor having a thickness of about 124 m.Figure 8 shows the calculated X ray absorption or both materjals, the latter being shown on the figure asYNaO4 Nb. Over the range of importance in most general purpose radiography, 40 100 kiloelectron volts KEV , the YTaO4 Nb screen has almost twice as muchX ray absorption as CaWO4 of equivalent thickness and, thus, Provides the possibility of reducing the X ray exposure to almost half without increasing the image noise. One measure of performance of and X ray intensifying screen is the speed analogous to pbotographic speed , that is, the optical density achieved after X ray exposure of a film in coutact with the screen. This has been determined by measuring the density of blackening of the X ray film after exposure of such film in contact with the screen in acccrdance with the procedure carried out as set forth below. Sample Freparation The phosphor is sieved through a 400 mesh sieve U.S. Sieve Series and the following components are introduced into a 15 cc vial containing eight 4 m diameter glass beads see U.S. Patent 3,043,710 6.19 g of YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 phosphor the amount will vary directly with the density of the phosphor 1.00 ml of butyl acetate 2.54 g of polyvinyl butyral binder. The resultant mixture is shaken on a Spex oscillatory type shaker for 15 minutes, then immediately coated on a pigment board using a Goodner mechanical coater and a 10 mil 254 m draw down knife. The resultant coating is dried in air for at least 15 minutes to give a dry coating of 5 1 nil 130 m 1 25 um in thickness A 1 inch X 1 1 2 inch 2.54 x 3.81 cm sample is cut from the coated board and mounted on a pigment board with other samples and standards for exposure tests.B. Sample Testing The pigment board with the screen samples attached is inserted into an 8 inch x 10 inch 20.3 cm x 25.4 cm cassette containing a sheet of high speed medical X ray film, in this instance Du Pont Cronex 4 film. An X ray exposure of 1.0 mAs at 80 KVp is made at á distance of 25 inches 63.5 cm from a tungsten source filtered by 1 4 inch 6.35 mm thick aluminum. The film then removed and processed in an automatic rapid proceasser which is operated at 33 C and contains the standard p N methylamine hydrcsulfate hydroquinone de eloper, with a total processing time of 90 seconds to develop, fix, wash and dry .The optical density of the exposcd and develop d film is determined using a MaeBeth digital densitometer, recorded as the speed and quoted relative to the density of an identical exposure rrade with a commercial Crone 4 Par intensifying screen made with CaWO4. As a result of impioved X rey to light conversion efficiency, the speed of the X ray intensifying screen made with the aforesaid M1 structure phosphor is higher than that r..ade with anM structure phosphor of the same formula and of a similar coating thickness. Screens made with the M1structure phosphor containing an appropriate amount of the activator o intensifier ffo, Tm or Tb are faster than those made with similar phosphor coating which does not contain the activator or intensifier and they are faster than the commonly used CaWO4.This increased speed is important for applications in which lower X ray exposure is desired. It is sometimes desirable to adjust the speed of a screen in order to better match the sensitivity of a particular film or to achievc a particular radiological objective. Since it is difficult to adjust the speed of a phosphor such asCaWO4, screen adjustments, for example, slower speeds, are achieved by adding a dye to the screen however, this can result in image noIse being produced. There fore, it is far more desirable to adjust the speed of the phosphor. The speed of the instant phocphor can be adjusted, over the range of intermediate spceds between the highest speed measured and reported herein for the instant phosphor and the speed of CaWO4, or even lower, by changing the concentration of the activator or intensifier or by making an appropriate addition of certain other rare earth elements. The dependence of speed on activator concentration is moderately strong and control of speed in whis man er rcquires very careful control of activator concentration. The dependence of speed on the concentration of the certain other rare earth elements is considerably weaker and the use cf such elements provides a convenient way of making phosphors with a substantially continuous range of speeds.The speed of tne instant phosphor can bc slowed by replacing up to about 15 mole percent of the yttrium, lutetium or gadolinium with ytterbium. For example, the addition of Yb to the preferred Nb containing yttrium tantalate results in the phosphor of the composition Y1 yYbNb0.05Ta0.95O4 where y is 0 to about 0.15. If y is 0 in this formula, that is, if no Yb is present, it t can be seen that the resultant compound represents an embodiment of the previously described YNbxTa1 xO4. As y is increased, the speed of the phosphor decreases until, when y is about 0.1, the speed is about equal to that of the CaWO4 screen.Further increase in y results in further decrease in speed. The speed of the instant phosphor can also be slowed by replacing up to about 45 mole percent of the yttrium, lutetium or gadolinium with lanthanum. For example, the addition of La to the preferred Nb containing yttrium tantalate results in the phosphor of the composition Y1 yLaNb0.05Ta.095O4 where y is 0 to about 0.45.If y is O in this formula, that is If no Da is present. it. can be seen that the resultant compound represents an embodiment of the previously deseribed YNbxTa1 xO4, As y is increased, the steed of the phosphor S decreased and when y reaches about 0.4, the speed is about equal to that of the CaWO4 screen. Further increase in y results in further decrease in speed. The speed of the instant blue emitting phosphor can be slowed by replacing up to about 15 mole percent of the yttrium or lutetium with gadolinium. For example, the addition of Gd to the preferred Nb containing yttrium tantalate results in the pnosphor o the composition Y1 yGdyNb0.05Ta0.95O4 where y 0 to about 0.15. If y is O in this formula, that is, if no Gd is present, it can be seen that the resultant compound represents en embodiment of the previously described YNbxTa1 xO4. As y is increased, the speed of the phosphor decreases when y Is about 0.08, the speed is about equal to that of the CaWO4 screen.Further increase in y results in further decrease in speed. Some lumineseent materials exhibit an undesirable delayed fluoreseence sometimes called afterglow , phosphorescence or lag that results from unexplained, but much slower, secondary emission.Delayed fluorescence becomes a problem only then the phosphor screen is used ill rapid succession for several films. Afterglow which persists for times longer than that taken for the film change will then impose a prior image as a ghost on the succeeding film. Net lag that is, lag minus background is absent in screens rade with the more preferredYNbxTa1 xO4 where x is about 0.05. hag is determined by exposing the screen sample to 400 mAs 80 KVp X rays from the same tungsten source described above, but without the aluminum filter, and then, after 15 seconds, contacting the screen sample with a fresh piece of film for 10 minutes. The film is then developed and the optical donsity is measured as described above. The optical density so recorded is the lag. Background is determined by exposing a piece of the same X ray film employed to dctermine lag to the lag exposure in the absence of any test screcn. u diference between the hackground and lag is recorded as the net lag. Best Hode The preferred phosphor which emits blue light is YNb0.05Ta0.95O4. Stoichiometric amounts of Ta2O5,Nb2O5 and Y2O3 are well blended and th preflred in an alumina container in air at about 1000 C to about 12000C for about 10 to 14 hours. This material is then mixed with an equal amount, by weight, of flux.In the following examples of this composition LiCl was used as the flux however, Li2SO4 is the preferred flux material. The resultant mixture is fired for 4 to 14 hours at 1200 C. The YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 M1 structure product in the form of a whIte e uniform powder is recovered by water leaching, filtering and washing and then dried. In the following examples and experiments parts are by weight unless otherwise noted. X ray excited speeds were determined by the procedure aescribed above and are reported relative to the speed of Cronex Par intensifying screen made with CaWO4, the latter being 1.0 on the relative basis. Since relative intensities may vary with the time of measurement, the relative intensities reported in any of the following tables for compositions being compared therein in any one table were determined at substantially the same time. Example 1YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 A. 10.000 g of Ta2O5, 0.317 g of Nb2O5 and 5.318 g of Y2O3 were wcighed to the nearest mg and blended for 30 minutes in a Spex oscillating type shaker. This mixture was prefired in an AL2O3 container in air at 1000 C for 14 hours. The prefired material was then mixed with LiCl flux 1 part of prefired material to 1 part of flux and fired for 4 hours at 1200 C.The product was recovered by water leaching, filtering and washing and then dried .The product Figure a depicts the electron scanning micrograph was recovered as a white, uniform powder, which fluoresced bright blue under UV or X ray excitation, having an average particle size of 4.2 m as determined with a Firsher subsieve sizer and a surface area of 0.19 m2 g as determined by gas absorption . X ray diffraction measurements showed that it crystallized as a single phase with the M1 structure and the following lattice constants a 5.2975 A b 5.4486 A c 5.1103 A ss 96.453 d grees p X ray density 7.46 g ml 1.The X ray excited spectrum is similar to that ofCaWO4 but peaks at higher energy 409 vs 428 nm SeeFigure 5 . The X ray excited speed is 1.86 times that of a Croncx Par intensifying screen made with CaWO4. B. YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 was prepared in a manner identical to that used for pert A above except that the e firing at 18 hours was carried out at 1600 C, that is, above the transition tempcrature. The particulate product was recovered as colorless single phase YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 with the M structure, as determined by X ray diffraction, having a particle size of 5.3 m and a surface area 0.15 m2 g. The lattice parameters were a 5.3271 A b 10.933 A c 5.054 A ss 95.52 degrees p X ray 7.56 g ml 1. The X ray excited speed was 0.84 relative to the Cronex Par intensifying screen CaWO4 . This is to be compared with 1.86, found for the M1 structure material of the same formula as described in part A above, demonstrating the superior performance of theM1 structure material relative to the M structure material. Differences in the X ray diffraction and the Raman spectra of the M and M1 materials are shown in Figures 2 and The procedure of this part B was repeated, except that the flux of part A was absent and the firing temperature was 1500 C. Such procedure is representative of known solid state procedures. The electron scanning micrograph of the resultant product is shown in Figure lb. C. YNb0.05Ta0.95O4 with the M1 structure, made in the manner described in part A above, was converted to M structure material by heating to a temperature of 1600 C for 2 hours. The X ray excited speed for this converted material was 0.95, again demonstrating the superior performance of the M1structure material relative to the M structure material.

The amounts of oxides used fof each preparation are shown in Table V. All products were single phase with the M1 structure. For these compositions X ray performance was measured by exposing a thick 1 2 1.27 cm diameter pellet of phosphor to 20 KVp No radiation and dctecting the light output from the phosphor with an EMI GeneomIne. 9635Q photomultiplier.The Intensity of emission is compared to that from an equal area of a Du Pont Cronex Lo Dose 2 Mammography Screen made with CaWO4 reported in the table as Relative Intensity . Considering the reduced sensitivity o the photomultiplier to green light versus blue and the inereased X ray absorption relative to CaWO4 realizable with an 80 KVpX ray beam, the effcctive speed is expscted to be higher than the relative intensity as measured herein. For a Cronex 4 X ray film properly sensitized for green light, the effective speed relative to the Cronex Par Cronex 4 screen film comoination is expected to be about twice the relative intensity. Effective Speed is included in Table V along with the other results.For comparison Experiment C shows that the emission decreases as y increases above about 0.15 and Experiment D shows that emission decreases upon going from the t structure te the A structure.

The phosphor layer coating weights were varied from a wet thickness of 0.01 to 0.03 inch 0.0254 to 0.0762 cm . The screens prepared in this manner were suitable for use as X ray screens. Each of these screen was tested by exposure, in conjunction with a portion of conventionalX ray film, to an X ray unit at 80 KVP, 2 mAs through a 2 mm aiuminum filter. A step wedge and a resolving power target were also placed between the X ray source and the film sereen in direct contact therewith .Eacn film was then developed, fixed and wasned in a conventional X ray developing system and the speed and resolution were determined for each sample. nese measurements were also made on coptrol samples watch utilized conventional calcium tungstate phosphere, the osntrol samples bein propared andcoated, at similar coating weights, over similar reflective layers. For all comparable samples the YNbxTa1 xO4type phosphor screens show improved performance over the CaWO4 screens. This can be seen in Figure 7, were reslution is plotted against the phosphor coating weight, and in Figure 9, where the speed of the screen relative to Par CaWO4 1.0 is plotted aga nst the resolution obtained.

Several indiviqual coatings were made, varying the wet thiakn ss of the phosphor from about 0.02 to 0.045 inch 0.0508 to 0.1143 cm . After drying, each of the phosphor layers was ove th a thin prot ctive layer of a cellulose ester polymer and the screens were then baked overnight at about 70 C. The final acreens prepared in this manner were eminently suitable for use as X ray screens and were tested as described inExample 48. When compared to conventional CaWO4 screens they produced superior results in speed and image sharpness.Utility The luminescent material described above is useful a a phosphor in X ray intensifying screens.
