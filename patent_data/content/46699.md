# ION MOBILITY DETECTOR PROVIDED WITH A MEMBRANE INTERFACE

## Abstract
A membrane interface 11 is disposed over the sample inlet port 15 of an ion mobility detector 10 . Sample, included as a vapor or gas component in a gas stream impinging the exterior surface of the membrane 11 , penetrates the membrane and is carried into the ion mobility detector 10 by means of a carrier gas which is directed through passage means 52, 54 onto the interior surface of the membrane 11 , so as to scrub the interior surface of the membrane 11 of any sample which penetrates the mem brane 11 , and thence through passage means 15 into the reaction region 12 of the ion mobility detector 10 .
