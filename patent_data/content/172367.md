# Dual diaphragm pump.

## Abstract
A pneumatically operated reciprocating three way valve having particular application to a double diaphragm pump is operative without a lubricating oil mist or the inefficiency resulting from air leakage between the valve piston 72 and cylinder 74 . Sticking and stalling of the valve piston are prevented by deformation of the cylinder 74 under pressure to provide leakage of selected cavities within the valve. The pump also avoids the use of a deicer mist by an adjustable bleed of high pressure air to provide a two step exhaust.
