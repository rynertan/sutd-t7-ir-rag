# Mixing valve.

## Abstract
A single lever mixing valve 10 adapted for proportion ing hot and cold water and for controlling the volume of flow. A valve body 22 has fluid passages 27, 28 which terminate in two spaced apart inlet ports 39, 40 and an outlet port 56 to a valve seat 46 . A generally spherical closure member 50 is universally movable within the valve body so as to normally cover and seal the inlet ports in a closed position. Two recesses 66, 68 in the surface of the closure member are spaced apart by a divider portion 70 and extend circumferentially relative to the inlet ports. Due to this configuration, the closure member can be moved to open mixing positions in which each recess completes a fluid passage between one of the inlet ports and the outlet port. The divider portion can be positioned to partially or fully close one inlet port while the other inlet port remains open.
