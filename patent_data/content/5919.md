# Process for sealing anodised aluminium and product so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for sealing anodic oxide films on aluminium comprises immersing the anodised aluminium in a bath containing an aqueous solution of a sealing accelerator, preferably triethanolamine, at a pH of 7 to 11, followed by conventional treatment in a hot water bath containing an anti smut additive. The preliminary accelerator treatment allows the sealing step to be substantially accelerated and permits the production of an essentially smut free surface on the sealed anodic oxide film.
