# Sound signal processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A sound signal processing apparatus converts the frequency of a sound signal. More specifically, by turning a first switching means 141, 142 and a second switching means 151 to 154 to a first state, a sound signal is obtained from a low pass filter 4 . The sound signal is sampled as a function of a first clock pulse having a fixed frequency f1 and the sampled output is stored in a random access memory 95 . The stored data in the random access memory is read out as a function of a second clock pulse having a frequency f2 varying as a function of a control signal and is withdrawn through a filter 13 having an attenuation characteristic varying in association with the frequency of the second clock pulse. The obtained sound signal is subjected to conversion of the frequency converted to be as large as f2 f1 times that of the input sound signal. Conversely, by turning the first and second switching means to a second state, the sound signal obtained from the filter is sampled as a function of the second clock pulse and the sampled data is stored in the random access memory 95 . The stored data in the random access memory is read as a function of the first clock pulse and is withdrawn through a low pass filter. The obtained sound signal has the frequency which is as large as f1 f2 times that of the input sound signal.
