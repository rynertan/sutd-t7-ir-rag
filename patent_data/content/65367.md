# Polypropylene composition for extrusion coating.

## Abstract
Improved extrudibility, compared with that of polypropy lene alone, is exhibited by polymeric compositions containing a a major proportion of crystalline propylene polymer, b a low density polyethylene, and c a copolymer of vinyl toluene and alpha methyl sty rene, characterized in that the copolymer c has been hy drogenated to the point that at least 50 of its aromatic unsat uration has been reduced, and has a drop softening point from 100 to 160 C, the polyethylene b has a density of 0.915 to 0.920, a melt index of 3 to 15, and a G
