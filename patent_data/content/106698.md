# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING LAYERED AMORPHOUS SEMICONDUCTOR ALLOYS USING MICROWAVE ENERGY

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 and process utilize microwave energy for depositing amorphous alloy materials in layered form onto a receiving surface 14 . The process includes the steps of providing at least one source of microwave energy 18 , providing at least two reaction gases, each gas containing at least one alloying element to be deposited onto the receiving surface 14 , and selectively exciting the reaction gases with microwave energy to create excited species 27 , 27 containing the alloying elements to be deposited for depositing the alloys in alternating layers 22 onto the receiving surface 14 . Preferably, the alternating alloy layers 22 are silicon and germanium alloys.
