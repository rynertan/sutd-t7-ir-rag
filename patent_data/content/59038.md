# METHOD OF FORGING HEAVY ARTICLES

## Abstract
A heavy goods vehicle front axle beam 10 is produced on a forging press having a rated maximum forging pressure which would normally only enable the press to produce a much lighter weight beam. The method comprises taking an optimal ly shaped rolled and bent starting blank 10b and subjecting the blank to two consecutive separate pressing operations in the forging press during a first one of which operations the dies of a first toolset act on only part of the blank to forge it to sub stantially its final shape and act on the remainder of the blank to forge it only to an intermediate shape and in the second of which operations the whole of the part shaped blank is forged to its desired final shape in a second toolset. The pressure ex erted during each individual pressing operation is less than the rated maximum forging pressure of the press.
