## Description
PREPARATION OF DIPHENYLMETHANE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to the preparation of diphenylmethane derivatives and more particularly to the preparation of substituted derivatives of 2 methyl diphenylmethane and substituted derivatives thereof. The compound 2 methyl diphenylmethane and substituted derivatives thereof are intermediates in the synthesis of anthraquinone and substituted derivatives thereof. The compound referred to herein as 2 methyl diphenylmethane may alternatively be described as 2 benzyltoluene, ortho benzyltoluene or l methyl 2 phenylmethyl benzene. It has previously been proposed to prepare 2 methyl diphenylmethane by the reaction between 2 chloromethyltoluene ortho xylyl chloride and benzene using as catalyst relatively large amounts either of boron trifluoride or of an inorganic acid for example sulphuric acid .These known processes have the disadvantage of requiring long reaction periods, or expensive catalysts, or difficult separation of the organic product from a large amount of catalyst. According to the present invention th te. is provided a process for the preparation of a 2 methvl diphenylmethane which comprises reacting 2 chloromethyltoluene or benzyl chloride with benzene or a xylene respectively in the liquid phase in the presence of liquid hydrogen fluoride. The proportion of hydrogen fluoride is preferably at least 0.5 mole per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene 4 or benzyl chloride. It is however an advantage of the process of the present invention that unconsumed ffi hydrogen fluoride may readily be recovered and accordingly it is convenient to employ at least 1 mole for example from 1 to 25 moles of hydrogen 3. fluoride per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene or of benzyl chloride. Thus the reaction may be carried out using hydrogen fluoride, in effect, as the reaction medium, the upper limit to the ratio of hydrogen fluoride to 2 chioromethyltoluene or to benzyl chloride being set only by economic considerations such as the size of the reactor and of the hydrogen fluoride recovery system. An inert liquid diluent may, however, be present if desired. If a diluent is used this is preferably a liquid with a boiling point such that it may readily be removed by distillation at the end of the reaction. Suitable diluents include alkanes thus, for example, when benzene is a reactant a convenient diluent is n hexane. It is preferred to use at least 1 mole of benzene or xylene for example from 2 to 10 moles per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene or of benzyl chloride respectively. A larger excess of benzene or xylene may be used if desired, the upper limit again being set by economic considerations The reaction may be carried out over a wide temperature range, for example in the range from OOC to 10000. The reaction may conveniently be carried out, for example, at substantially ambient temperature under conditions of reflux of the hydrogen fluoride. Superatmospheric pressure may be used if desired. At the higher temperatures within the range referred to, some demethylation of the 2 methyl group may occur, the extent depending upon the reaction period and the ratio of the reactants employed. Accordingly, it is in general advisable that the reaction temperature should not exceed 800C, the range 0 C to 500C especially from OOC to 300C being preferred. When the reactants are 2 chloromethyltoluene and benzene the main product under the preferred conditions is 2 methyl diphenylmethane itself. When the reactants are benzyl chloride and m xylene 1,3 xylene , the main product under the preferred conditions is 2,4 dimethyldiphenylmethane. When the reactants are benzyl chloride and p xylene l,4 xylene , the main product under the preferred conditions is 2,5 dimethyldiphenylmethane. When the reactants are benzyl chloride and o xylene 1,2 xylene , a mixture of products may be obtained, including 2, 3 dimethyldiphenylmethane. The reaction may be carried out either batchwise or continuously. At the end of the reaction any hydrogen fluoride remaining may readily be recovered by standard techniques for example by vacuum distillation or, in appropriate cases, by phase separation and, if desired, recycled to the process. Any excess xylene or benzene may similarly be recovered and recycled.The 2 methyl diphenylmethane or substituted derivative thereof produced may be separated and purified by conventional methods The invention is illustrated by the following examples in which parts are parts by weight.EXAMPLE 1 Liquid hydrogen fluoride 8 parts was added to a mixture of E xylene 63.6 parts and benzyl chloride 12.6 parts contained in a pressure vessel. The reaction mixture thus contained 6 moles of g xylene and 4 moles of HF per mole of benzyl chloride. The reaction mixture was maintained at 200C for 60 minutes. The hydrogen chloride evolved during the reaction was then vented off. The reaction product was added to an excess of cold water the organic layer was separated off, washed free from acid and dried over calcium chloride. Vacuum distillation yielded 18.0 parts 92 theory of 2,5 dimethyldiphenylmethane analysis by gas liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance .EXAMPLE 2 Liquid hydrogen fluoride 8 parts was added to a mixture of m xylene 63.6 parts and benzyl chloride 12.6 parts contained in a pressure vessel. The reaction mixture thus contained 6 moles of m xylene and 4 moles of HF per mole of benzyl chloride. The reaction mixture was maintained at 200C for 30 minutes. At the end of this period the product was added to an excess of cold water and separated as described in Example 1. Vacuum distillation yielded 14.9 parts of 2,4 dimethyldiphenylmethane 76 theory .EXAMPLE 3 Liquid hydrogen fluoride 26 parts was added to a mixture of benzene 64 parts and 2 chloromethyltoluene 19 parts contained in a pressure vessel. The reaction mixture thus contained 6.1 moles of benzene and 9.6 moles of HF per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene. The reaction mixture was maintained at 200C for 30 minutes. The hydrogen chloride evolved during the reaction was then vented off. The reaction product was added to an excess of cold water the organic layer was separated off, washed free from acid and dried over calcium chloride. Vacuum distillation yielded 16.1 parts 65 theory of 2 methyl diphenyl methane analysis by gas liquid chromatography . EXAMPLE 4 Liquid hydrogen fluoride 15 parts was added to a mixture of benzene 47 parts and 2 chloromethyltoluene 14 parts contained in a pressure vessel. The reaction mixture thus contained 6.0 moles of benzene and 7.5 moles ofHF per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene. The reaction mixture was maintained at 200C for 1 hour. At the end of this period the product was added to an excess of cold water and separated as described in Example 1. Vacuum distillation yielded 14 parts of 2 methyldiphenylmethane 78 theory .EXAMPLE 5 The proportions of reactants were the same as in Example 2 but the mixture was heated at 75 C for 8 hours. Under these conditions some demethylation occured and vacuum distillation yielded 15 parts of a product consisting of 40 by weight of 2 methyl diphenylmethane and 60 by weight of diphenylmethane.EXAMPLE 6 Liquid hydrogen fluoride 400 parts was added to a mixture of benzene 390 parts , 2 chloromethyltoluene 140.5 parts and n hexane 39 parts contained in a polythene reaction vessel provided with a condenser. The reaction mixture thus contained 5 moles of benzene and 20 moles of HF per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene. The reaction mixture was maintained at 80C to 120C for 1 hour, with stirring. At the end of this period the organic layer was separated from the hydrogen fluoride layer, washed with water and then with dilute sodium carbonate solution. Excess benzene, together with the n hexane, was removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure.The residue was distilled under vacuum 3 mm Hg to yield 149 parts of substantially pure 2 methyldiphenylmethane 82 theory .EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 6 was repeated except that the initial reaction mixture consisted of liquid hydrogen fluoride 441 parts , benzene 780 parts , 2 chloromethyltoluene 140.5 parts and n hexane 78 parts . The mixture thus contained 10 moles of benzene and 21 moles of HF per mole of 2 chloromethyltoluene. The reaction period at 80C to 120C was 22 minutes. The reaction products were treated as described in Example 6 to yield 155 parts of substantially pure 2 methyldiphenylmethane 85 theory .
