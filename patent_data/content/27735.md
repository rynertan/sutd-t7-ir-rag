# Method and apparatus for manufacturing stretched sheets from a tubular film.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a pair of longitudinally and transversely stretched sheets from a flattened tubular ther moplastic polymer film comprises feeding the film 32 in a longitudinal direction E at a first speed, progressively grip ping the film 32 along opposite selvages 33,34 thereof stretching the film 32 longitudinally and transversely while heating it and releasing the stretched film 32 to allow it to cool and set. In order to stretch the film 32 and to separate it into two sheets 37,38 the gripped selvages 33,34 are moved along a pair of arcuate divergent paths lying in substantially the same plane at a second speed greater than the first speed and the stretched film 32 is cut at the selvages 33,34 into a pair of sheets 37,38 at the end of the arcuate divergent paths. The invention also includes apparatus for carrying out the method.
