## Description
Circuit for detecting the passage through zero of the signal generated by an electromagnetic sensor of the phonic wheel type.The present invention relates to a circuit for detecting the passage through zero of the signal generated by a variable reluctance electromagn tic sensor of the phonic wheel type or the like.In particular, the invention concerns a detector circuit of the type comprising a first threshold comparator with hysteresis, for connection to the sensor and for outputting a signal indicative of the passage through zero of the signal at its input.A sensor or detector of the phonic wheel type is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. It comprises, in general, a disc W rotatable about its own axis and having a series of teeth N in suitable positions. A sensor S of electromagnetic type is associated with the disc W. The discW may have notches instead of teeth.When the disc W is rotated, for example in the sense of the arrow F in Figure 1, each time a tooth N passes in front of the sensor S, the latter outputs a voltage signal V the trend of which as a function of time T is illustrated qualitatively in Figure 2.The phonic wheel sensor shown in Figure 1 has various applications, particularly in the field of motor vehicles, for example, for detecting the speed of rotation of the drive shaft or for detecting the moment at which the engine pistons pass through top dead centre or bottom dead centre.In these applications it is important to he able to determine correctly the moment of the passage through zero of the signal V output by the sensor S.For this purpose, in the prior art, the signal V is supplied to the input of a threshold comparator circuit with hysteresis, for outputting a signal of the type shown schematically by the waveform B in Figure 2 the threshold comparator is arranged so that its output changes state for example, passing from a high to a low level when the signal V exceeds a threshold level Vl and changes state again when the signal V falls below zero. Each rising wave front b of the signal B is thus indicative of a passage of the signal V through zero.The circuit for detecting the passage through zero of the signal V which has just been described has the disadvantage of being very sensitive to the effect of any disturbances picked up by the sensor S. Furthermore, if, for example, the disc W is not perfectly circular or is mounted slightly out of alignment, the signal output by the sensor may show spurious passages through zero.In order to avoid the latter disadvantage, it has been proposed to adopt a threshold comparator circuit with a threshold which is variable in dependence on the amplitude of the signal input to the comparator. This solution avoids the disadvantage but is very expensive and, in any case, is sensitive to the effect of disturbing pulses of even modest power.The object of the present invention is to provide a circuit for detecting the passage through zero of the signal generated by an electromagnetic sensor of the aforesaid type, which is reliable in operation even in the presence of disturbing pulses, and which is of fairly low cost.This object is achieved according to the invention by a detector circuit of the type specified at the beginning, characterised in that it further includes an integrating circuit the input of which is connectible to the sensor, a second threshold comparator connected to the output of the integrating circuit for outputting an enabling electrical signal only when the signal output by the integrating circuit exceeds a predetermined threshold value, and an. enabling circuit connected to the outputs of the first and second threshold comparators and arranged to output the signal generated by the first comparator only when the second comparator outputs the enabling signal.Further characteristics and advantages of the detector circuit according to the invention will become apparent from the detailed description which follows with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 already described, shows a variablereluctance electromagnetic sensor of the phonic wheel type. Figure 2, already partly described, shows as a function of time the waveforms of five signals generated in operation by a detector circuit according to the invention, andFigure 3 is a part block circuit diagram of a detector circuit according to the invention.With reference to Figure 3, according to the invention an electromagnetic sensor S is connected to a circuit 1 for detecting the passage through zero of the signal V generated by the sensor.The circuit 1 includes a threshold comparator 2 of the type with hysteresis, for example inverting with an input connected to the output of the sensor S, and the other input connected to a source 3 of a constant reference voltage V1 S The output of the sensor S is also connected to an integrating circuit 4 of active type made, for example, with the use of an operational anplifier. The output of the integrator 4 is connected to an input of a second threshold comparator 5 the other input of which is connected to a source 6 of a constant reference voltage V2.The outputs of the threshold comparators 2 and 5 are connected to respective inputs of a NOR circuit 7.The detector circuit described above operates in the following manner. When a tooth in the disc W passes in front of the sensor S, the latter emits a signal having the waveform V of Figure 2 as stated above.Correspondingly, the outputs of the comparator 2 and the integrator 4 output signals having the respective waveforms B and C of Figure 2.The threshold comparator 5 for example, of a non inverting type compares the signal C from the integrator with the voltage level V2, and then outputs a signal the trend of which is substantially that of the waveform D of Figure 2. Similarly, the NOR circuit 7 outputs a signal having the waveform E of Figure 2 the descending front e of the signal E is thus indicative of the passage of the signal V through zero.The amplitude of the signal Coutput by the integrating circuit 4 is proportional to the energy associated with the signal V. The threshold comparator 5 and the NOR circuit 7 therefore cause the rising front b of the signal B to be interpreted as indicative of a passage of the signal V through zero only when the corresponding signal output by the sensor S has an energy greater than a minimum value. Thus, disturbing pulses, which have amplitudes comparable to those of true signals but considerbaly less energy, are differentiated therefrom.
