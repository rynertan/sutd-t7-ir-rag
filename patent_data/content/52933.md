# Object detector.

## Abstract
A vehicle detector installation comprises a loop oscilla tor 10 the loop 12 of which is laid in the roadway and which is locked in operation to a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 112 . Vehicle detection is effected by a phase detector 16 monitoring the phase difference between the oscillators. The VCO is incorporated in a phase lock loop PLL 110 that is capable of locking to a multiple of a reference frequency f
