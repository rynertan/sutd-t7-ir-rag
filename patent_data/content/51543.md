# Low energy extruder pump system.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a low energy extruder pump system. The thermoplastic material is fed into a screw extruder wherein the screw 12 comprises a feeding section 16 of relatively deep root depth HF , a transition section 18 of intermediate and decreasing root depth, a metering chamber 20 of relatively shallow root depth HM , and a mixing section 22 having flute passages 26 formed by longitudinally extending and alternate grooves and lands the resulting extrudate is then passed, through breaker plate 34 and adapter means 36 , to a rotary gear pump 40 and discharged to a die 54 . This extruder pump system provides a required pumping action at a lower level of energy consumption than was attainable in conventional systems.
