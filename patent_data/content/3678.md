# A gear assembly.

## Abstract
A gear assembly a gear assembly which is used in a power assisted steering system of a vehicle. The gear assembly comprises a piston 1 within a cylinder 2 , the piston 1 being axially displaceable in response to an input shaft 4 . The piston 1 is axially rotatable by means of a track 18 and track follower 19 in response to axial displacement. Splines 40 on the piston 1 intermesh with teeth 42a of a take off part 42 which is laterally spaced and in side by side relationship with the piston. By rotation of the piston 1 an output shaft 44 of the take off part 42 is rotated. In a modification the take off part instead of being in side by side relationship is an extension of the piston and the track is of variable curved portions.
