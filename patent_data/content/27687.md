## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVr.NTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to spinning style fishing reels, and more particularly, relates to a mechanism that causes the bail of the fishing reel to pivot automatically from the casting position to the retrieving position. 2. Background of the Prior Art It is well known in the prior art of the fishing reels to cause the bail to automatically move from the casting position to the retrieving position. There have been attempts to make manual override systems for the automatic bail trip mechanism in spinning reels with one such mechanism being taught in U. S.Patent Application Serial No. 932,850, filed August 11, 1968, by Elvis 7. Moss. Another automatic bail closing device is taught in U. S. Application Serial No. 932,791, filed August 11, 1968, by R. R. Councilman et al. which does not have a manual override. In another automatic bail closing mechanism which is taught in U. S. Patent No. 4,098,473 a J shaped lever is mounted within the ear of a bail arm support with an actuatio spring located within the J shaped arm. The arm moves back and forth in the ear by means of the cam mounted on the fishing reel housing. However, assembly of the reel mechanism is time consuming and the mechanism is hard to operate. In all these prior art devices, a simple mechanism using sliding arm that provides a bail trip that is quickly assembled and disassembled and which provides good positive action is not taught. SUMMAPXY OF THE IiXENTION This invention relates to a spinning style fishing reel and comprehends an improved means for permitting the bail of the fishing reel to pivot from its casting position to its retrieving position. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a spinning style fishing reel with a mechanism that automatically moves the fishing reel bail from the open casting position to the closed retrieving position with very little cranking effort. It is another object of this invention to provide such a bail closing mechanism that is incorporated totally within the rotor portion of a fishing reel. Yet another object of this invention is the provision for such a bail closing operation whereby a trip lever is mounted in one of the ears of the fishing reel and is slidably moved within the rotor by a cam located on the face of the fishing reel housing. And yet another object of this invention is to utilize the provisions of a very simple Z shaped bail trip lever. Still another object of this invention is the provision for a spring that is mounted on the rotor providing constant force for the lever arm. The above and other and further objects and features will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF BASIC STRUCTURE AND OPERATION OF FISHING REEL In Figure 1 an open face style fishing reel 1 is shown in an exploded perspective view. The reel l having a housing 10 which includes an integral gear case 28, a stem 12 which connects the housing 10 to a mounting foot 11 which is used to attach the reel to a spinning style fishing rod. The reel includes a crank assembly 40 rota table about a crank handle shaft 41 with a rotatable winding handle 44 for use by a fisherman with his left hand for line retrieval while the rod not shown is being held by his r√≠ght hand. The handle 44 may be disposed on the other side of the gear case 28 to accommodate the personal desires of the user. An axially mounted rotor housing 230 is provided and adapted to rotate about the axis of the central spool shaft 300 as the crank 40 is turned for line retrieval with the line 5 being captured by the bail 270 passing over the line roller 272, The bail 270 and the line roller 272 rotate with rotor 230 and the fishing line 5 is thereby wound on the spool 290.The screws 281 function as pivot points and are accordingly the centers of rotation of the bail 270 via the bail arms 260 and 280. An oscillator mechanic 30 causes the spool 290 to reciprocate axially back and forth as the rotor 230 winds a line 5 about the spool 290 but as in spinning reels generally, the spool 290 does not rotate about the axis of the central shaft 300 except as controllably permitted by the adjustable drag mechanism 50. Such limited rotation of the spool may occur during line retrieval when a fish is on the other end of the line 5 fighting for its life while still in the water and, thus the force of the drag friction is overcome by tension in the line. This is a feature that prevents the internal mechanism from being destroyed when a large fish is on the end of the line 5. When the bail 270 is swung to an open position for casting, the line 5 may freely payout from the spool 290. In the overall arrangement of the reel, a side cover plate 14 is secured to the housing 10 to cover the gear housing 28 which includes a drag pocket 13 and is accomplished by means of screws 17. The drive gear assembly 150 includes a drive gear 153 that is mounted on the drive gear shaft 154 and is received at one end in the side lip 136 of cam 130. 3earing collar 131 is coaxial with the lip 136 and mounted on the opposite side of the cam surface 133. The gear assembly 150 and the oscillator cam 130 each have an internal hole and are coaxially mounted on the crank handle 41 with the drive shaft 154 externally mounted in the side plate bearing 15 and the bearing collar 131 mounted in bearing 16 that is part of the side of the housing 10 and coaxial with bearing 15 but not shown in Figure 1 . Oscillator slide yoke 140 surrounds cl surface 133 of the can assembly 130 and is slidably mounted near the bearing 16 in the gear case 28. Retainer screw 42 secures the crank handle shaft 41 to the reel 1. As can be readily appreciated, the crank assembly 40 can be removed from the reel 1 and reversed so that the reel 1 can be held by a fisherman in his left hand and cranked by his right hand. Pinion assembly 60 is mounted in the front hole 29 of the front face 25 and surrounded by bearing 70 which is kept in place by retainer 72. Mounted inside the gear case 28 on the pinion assembly 60 is theself centering ratchet 67. In front of retainer 72, a spacer ring 74 and a trip lever retainer 76 are mounted on the pinion 60. The rotor 230 is mounted on the pinion assembly 60 in front of retainer 76 and is secured thereto by means of washer 61 and nut 62. Center spool shaft 300 is rotatably mounted in and supported by the pinion assembly hole 64 with the back end 301 thereof extending past the partition 20 into the drag assembly 50.The spool 290 is mounted on the shaft 300 and secured thereto by means of spool cap 292 The shaft 300 is secured to the oscillator yoke slide 140 and reciprocates back and forth relative to the rotor when the crank handle shaft 41 rotates. Pinion gear 63 mounted at the back of the pinion assembly 60 mates with the drive gear 153 and is rotatable thereby.The pinion assembly 60 in turn causes the rotor 230 to rotate about the spool 290. Because the oscillator cam assembly 30 and the gear drive assembly 150 are both operated by the crank assembly 40 at the same time, the spool 290 reciprocates back and forth relative to the rotational motion of the line roller 272 about the spool and by this cooperative movement the line 5 is wound around the spool 290. The axis 2 of the rotor 230, shaft 300, pinion assembly 60, and drag assembly 50 is appro imately perpendicular to the axis 3 of the crank handle assembly 40, oscillator mechanism 30 and the drive gear assembly 150. The axis 2 is located above the axis 3 being nearer to the foot 11. The bail 270 is normally stored in the closed or retrieve position whereby the line roller 272 functions to wind the line 5 about the spool 290 by turning the handle 44 relative to the reel 1. When the bail 270 is to be open or placed in the casting or open position, the bail 270 is pivoted about the L shaped bail ears 231 and 232 and locked in place by the trip lever 220 that is received by the cam 261 and trip ramp 264 surfaces located on the underside of the bail arm 260 not shown in Figure 1 the underside of bail arm 260 faces into the cavity of the ear 231. In the casting position, the line 5 is free to payout from the spool 290. During casting, this payout of the line is quite rapid, thus, the fisherman using this open faced style fishing reel is obligated to use his finger to snub the line to arrest the payout since neither the rewind or line retrieval mode the winding of the line about the spool 90 by the line roller 272 or the drag mechanism 50 is operational.In order to change the bail from the open casting position to the closed rewind or retrieve position, the rotor 230 is rotated causing the trip lever 220 to disengage trom the trip ramp 264 permitting the bail return springs 283 and 254 to pivot the bail 270 back to the retrieve position. A feature bf tnis fishing reel is a self cent rin bail mechanism that permits the rotation of the rotor 230 to the same position for opening the bail 270 at the optimum casting position. A self centering lever arm 350 is mounted within the gear case by means of screw 351 and washer 352 with the back end 354 of the arm 350 in operable engagement with the selfcentering button 80. The lever arm spring 353 mounted on the drive gear shaft 154 urges the pawl end 355 toward the ratchet 67.But, with the button 80 in the back position, the pawl 355 is pivoted out of engagement with the ratchet 67. Tten the button 80 is in the forward position closer to the stem 12 and farther from the drag assembly 50, then the bottom of the button 80 permits the pawl end 355 of the arm 350 to come into contact with the ratchet 67 so that the rotor 230 can be rotated backwards counter to the direction of rotation for winding the line around the spool to a pre selected position for opening the bail at the casting position The same mechanism acts as an ant reverse device for the reel so that the rotor can only be rotated backward less than one revolution. DESCRIPTION OF TEIE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In a preferred embodiment of the invention bail 270 mounted on bail arms 260 and 280 is manually pivoted to the casting position and is automatically pivoted re pivoted to the retrieve position. The bail assembly 271 and line roller 272 are mounted in bail arm hole 262 by means of screw 274. The rotor 230 has a central deck 236 with a front projecting open cylinder 237 extending toward the front of the reel with spool 290 surrounding a major portion of the cylinder 237. Extending from the deck 236 toward the back 19 of the reel housing 10 is a back projecting open cylinder 238 that subs.2ntially surrounds the front spool end 25 of the housing 10 including the front face cam 26 and trip lever retainer washer 76, as shown in Figure 2.The rotor ears 231 and 232 are part of the exterior surface 252 of cylinder 238 with radial passage 239 extending from the bowl 253 defined by the back cylinder 238 into the L shaped rotor ear 231 cavity 240. A partition 244 divides the cavity 240 into a passage section and a bail arm mounting section. The bail arm 260 is pivotally secured in the cavity 240 to the post 249 by means of screw 281 and washer 282 as shown in Figure 8. On the inside or underside surface 263 of the bail arm 260 is a sloping cam surface 261 and an adjacent trip ramp 264. The trip ramp 264 has a flat dwell portion 267 and a steep sloping drop off portion 266. A profile of the cam surface 261 trip ramp 264 projecting outwardly from the underside surface 263 is depicted in Figure 5A. Surface 261 and ramp 264 comprise approximately only one half or 1800 of the circumferential surface 263 located around hole 265. When the bail arm 260 is rotated to the casting position, its rotational motion is limited by the cam edge 261a contacting stop 259 located in the bail mounting section of the cavity 240. And, when the bail 270 is pivoted to the retrieve position, the trip ramp 264 contacts the stop 259 limiting the motion of the bail arm 260. As shown in Figures 2 and 10 12, a face cam 26 can be part of the housing 10 with the cam 26 having a minor radius 256 and a major or maximum radius 255.The cam rise, the angular displacement 257 on the cam 26 of the change from the minor radius 256 to the maximum radius 255, and the cam fall, the angular displacement 258 on the cam 2G of the change from the major radius 255 to the minor radius 256 are shown as being substantially equal however, they may be altered, if desired. 1 An elongated trip lever 220 is mounted on the back of the deck 236 in the bowl 253. The lever 220 has a cutout section 223 enabling the lever 220 to slide back and forth clearing the hub 250. The trip end 221 contacts the underside 263 before the stop 224 contacts the hub 250. The trip end 221 of the lever 220 is mounted in the cavity 240 adjacent and in constant contact with either the bail cam 261 or the trip ramp 264.A cam follower 222 is mounted at the other end of the lever 220 and projects into the area formed between the deck 236, the back cylinder 238 and the front face 25 which is defined as the pocket 254. Trip lever 220 is connected by hole 225 to one end of the spring 235 which passes partially through an elongated slot 242 in deck 236. The other end of the spring 235 is connected to post 243 on deck 236. Thus, the cam follower 222 is constantly being forced radially inwardly toward the central axis 2 and the trip end 221 is concomitantly being forced radially outwardly against the cam 261 or the trip ramp 26 in cavity 240 by spring 235. Stub 241 on deck 236 provides a guide means for lever 220. In the cavity 240 the partition 244 has a slot 248 that also acts as a guide means for the trip end 221 of lever 220.The combination of guide means 241 and 248 prevent the lever 220 from twisting or rotating relative to the deck 236. As illustrated in Figure 7, when the bail 270 is in the retrieve position, the trip end 221 is forced radially inwardly by the cam 261 toward the axis 2 and the cam follower 222 is forced radially outwardly from the axis 2. The relative position of the trip end 221 with respect to the cam 261 is indicated by dotted lines designating Position No. 1 on the cam profile shown in Figure SA. The rotor 230, the rotation of the cam follower 222 and the cam 26 are all coaxial with respect to the center axis 2. When the rotor 230 rotates, the follower 222 will trace a path with a radius 251 around axis 2 radius 251 being longer than radius 255 of the cam 26 and thus the follower will not contact the cam 26, as illustrated in Figure 12. When the bail 270 is in the casting position, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 9, the spring 235 forces the trip end 221 against the dwell portion 267 of the trip ramp 264 and radially outward from the axis 2 with the stop 224 bearing against hub 250. Concomitantly the follower 222 moves radially inwardly towards the axis 2. As shown in Figures 10 and 11, the follower 222 traces a partial rotational path around the axis 2 with radius 226, which is larger than radius 256 but smaller than radius 255. In the casting position, the trip end 221 is against the dwell 267 with the side of the end 221 locked against the drop off 266 preventing the rotation of the bail arm. The relative location of the end 221 is depicted by dotted lines on the cam profile of Figure 5A and designated asPosition No. 2.The relative positions of the rotor 230, the trip lever 220 with the cam follower 222 and the face cam 26 are shown in Figure 10 just after the bail has been positioned by the self centering mechanism and cocked to the casting position. In the casting position as the rotor 230 and the follower 222 rotate clockwise about the axis 2, the path traced by follower radius 226 indicates that the follower 222 contacts the cam 26 at point 226a. As the rotor 230 continues to revolve about axis 2, as shown in Figure 11, follower 222 is forced radially outwardly as it rides up the surface of cam 26. Thiscam rise is depicted by the angular displacement 227 and is approximately equal to the angular displacement 229of the cam fall. Near the end of the rapid outward radial displacement of the follower 222 caused by the cam surface 26, the trip end 221 is pulled away from the trip ramp 264 and contacts the incline of the cam 261.With the drop off 266 no longer bearing against the trip end 221, the spring 284 and, if desired, spring 283 cause the bail 270 to pivot to the retrieve position. Position No. 3 of Figure 5A and Figure 8 illustrate the location of the trip lever 220 and the bail arm 260 when the bail 270 is approximately halfway between the casting position and the retrieving position. in order to cause the rapid pivoting of the bail 270 from the casting position to the retrieve position the angular displacements 257 and 258 must be relatively small. The differences between the outer cam radius 255 and follower radius 226 and the angular displacements 227 and 228 must also be small.preferably the angular displacements 257 and 258 range from 250 to 600 and more preferably range from 400 to 500. It has been found that the angular displacements 227 and 229 for the radial movement of the cam follower 222 preferably should range from 10 to 25 and more preferably range from 120 to 160 in order to provide for rapid change from the casting position to the retrieving position. It is to be appreciated that the difference between the radius 226 and radius 255 must be greater than the rise of the drop off 266 between dwell 267 and the start of cam 261 or the bail cannot be pivoted from the casting position to the retrieving position. Latch cover 234 is secured to the L shaped ear 231 by means of screw 233 to enclose the passageway portion of the cavity 240. If the self centering bail mechanism were to be made inoperative and since the cam rise and fall are substantially the same, the rotor 230 can be rotated either in the clockwise direction or in the counterclockwise direction to rapidly change the bail 270 from the casting position to the retrieving position. However, it is customary to only rotate the rotor 230 in the clockwise direction. The trip lever retainer 76 has a flat sided hole and the rotor 230 has flats 247 in hole 246 that correspond to the milled flats on the pinion assembly 60. This enables the retainer 76 to be mounted adjacent the hub 250 to provide axial support for the trip lever 220. It should be understood, of course, that the specific forms of the invention illustrated and described herein are intended to be representative only, as certain changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the teachings herein disclosed. Accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims in ascertaining the full scope of the invention.
