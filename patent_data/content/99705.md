# Microwave ovens and methods of cooking food.

## Abstract
A portable microwave oven is designed to be powered from a domestic power socket with a rating not exceeding 1800 watts for the US market, or not exceeding 3000 watts for the UK market. The oven comprises a microwave generator 17 for supplying microwave power to a cavity of the oven, a thermal heating element 8 capable of heating the air within the oven cavity, a fan 7 for forcing a recirculating flow of air over the heating element 8 and through the cavity and a control circuit operative to supply continuous microwave power to the oven cavity simul taneously with the supply of thermal power to the cavity. The microwave power heats the inside of the food and the thermal power dissipates the resulting moisture and browns the external surface of the food.
