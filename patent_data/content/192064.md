## Description
The present invention refers to a method of purifying flue gases from refuse incineration by cooling them and for recovering heat energy and to an arrangement for performing the method. In the purifying, acid components, such as hydrochloric acid and various sulphuric oxides as well as dust, heavy metals and other detrimental substances, are separated. The recovered heat energy may be utilized for example in a water system for heating. It is known that flue gases from the combustion of conventional fuels, such as oil, coal, wood and peat, can be purified by being cooled to a temperature lying below the dew point. Some acid components, such as SO₃ and SO₂, are separated at the time of condensation together with water. Heat can be recovered simultaneously and can either be transferred directly to a hot water system for example for heating rooms or alternatively the temperature level of the heat energy is increased by means of a heat pump and can in such manner be transferred to a water system for heating. Cooling the flue gases generally is performed in one single stage from the initial temperature 150 Document EP A 0 102 770 discloses for example the manner in which flue gases from the combustion of natural gas, oil or coal is cooled to below the dew point, with sulphuric acid condensing on the cooling surfaces. In the mentioned document the cooling surfaces have been coated with Teflon in order to resist aggression by the sulphuric acid. Feed water and combustion air can be utilized as a cooling medium. Flue gases from refuse incineration include hydrochloric acid, and a very corrosive condensate is formed when cooling the flue gases to a temperature below the dew point. This condensate is much more aggressive than condensate from cooling flue gases of the fuels mentioned above. Also, the dew point is generally lower for flue gases from refuse as compared for example to oil. Another difference between refuse and other fuels is that refuse as a rule is a very cheap fuel, and therefore it is in most cases not profitable to utilize a heat pump for recovering heat energy from the flue gases. For cooling different types of flue gases in the temperature range in which condensation can occur generally lower than 150 In cooling flue gases from refuse incineration it has turned out to be difficult for alloyed steels to withstand the corrosive attack if the concentration of the hydrochloric acid in the condensate and the temperature become too high. In order to obviate this it has been necessary to utilize cooling water having a temperature of 25 Glass is resistant to hydrochloric acid, and with a cooler of glass tubes it is possible to obtain cooling water having a temperature of for example 70 A disadvantage of glass and plastics is their poor heat transmission capacity as compared to alloyed steels. This becomes particularly noticeable in temperatures below the dew point in which the coefficient of thermal conductance is affected more by the heat conduction capacity of the material than at temperatures above the point at which condensation of moisture begins. In cooling the flue gases in one stage down to below the dew point it is necessary either to make use of a corrosion resistant chimney or to heat the flue gases by 10 In order to remedy the weaknesses mentioned above of the facilities for cooling flue gases from refuse incineration which are known today the cooling should be carried out in three stages. In the first stage the flue gases are cooled by water in a cooler of glass and or plastic, with the temperature of the outgoing cooling water being adjusted such, that heat energy can be transferred directly without the aid of a heat pump to for example a district heating system. In a second stage the flue gases are cooled by air in a cooler of glass and or plastic. The flue gases are cooled to a temperature closely above the water dew point. The heated air is thereafter mixed with the flue gases after the last cooling stage, whereby a mixture of air and flue gases is reached which is dry and which does not cause corrosion problems in the flue gas fan, chimney, etc. In a third stage the flue gases are cooled by water, wherein the material of this cooler is alloyed steel. As i.a. moisture condensates on the cooling surfaces in this stage, the use of alloyed steel provides much better transmission of heat as compared to other materials, for example glass or plastic. Since the temperature of the flue gases lies close to the water dew point right at the inlet to this cooling stage the concentration of hydrochloric acid in the condensate and the temperature of the cooling surface always are low, which strongly reduces the danger of corrosion of the alloyed steel. For alloyed steels it is also an advantage from the viewpoint of corrosion that the cooling surface always is maintained moist, and therefore the condensate or some other liquid can be recirculated to the top of the cooler and over its components which are contacted by the flue gases. These surfaces are thereby also kept clean from any dust coatings. The temperature of the cooling water that is utilized is at such a low level in this third stage that it usually cannot be used directly in a heating system. In order to take advantage of the heat energy in the cooling water a heat pump then has to be used. If this is not economically profitable and cooling the flue gases down to this low temperature is necessary from the viewpoint of the environment, the heat energy of the cooling water has to be removed in other manner, for example in a cooling tower or by water from a lake, spring or stream. An example of an embodiment of the arrangement in accordance with the invention including typical temperatures will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing. In the drawing the designation 1 refers to a waste heat boiler, 2 is a first cooler, 3 is a second cooler, and 4 is a third cooler. The designation 5 refers to a droplet separator, 6 is a flue gas fan, 7 is a chimney and 8 is a collecting vessel. The designation 9 refers to a flue gas fan, 10 is an air fan, 11 are sprinklers or shower heads, 12 is a conduit for conveying air, 13 is a mixing point, and 14 is a conduit for condensate. The designations 15 and 16 refer to coolant water conduits. The flue gases from the waste heat boiler 1, which should be provided with electrostatic precipitators and an economiser known per se, have a temperature of 160 In the second cooler 3, which also consists of glass tubes and plastic components, the flue gases are cooled by air, with the temperature of the flue gases being lowered to approximately 55 In a third stage the flue gases are cooled in the tube cooler 4 of alloyed steel, for example of the type Avesta 254 SMO, down to 40 After the third and last cooling stage the flue gases continue to the droplet separator 5 which may be made of alloyed steel or plastic and in which the remaining drops of condensate of the flue gases are separated. After this the flue gases are mixed with the air heated in the cooler 3 of the second cooling stage, whereupon the flue gases pass the flue gas fan 6 and are expelled to the atmosphere through the chimney 7. In the third stage a condensate containing water, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric oxides, dust, heavy metals and other compounds is formed. A condensate can also be formed in the two first cooling stages. Furthermore, the various cooling surfaces are sprayed with condensate or some other liquid i.a. in order to be kept clean and free of coatings. The condensates and other liquids are collected in the collecting vessel 8 and are treated by neutralizing and precipitation, with a sludge being formed which i.a. contains various heavy metals. The sludge is dewatered and dealt with. It is important that the cooling surface on the flue gas side is maintained moist the entire time by being sprayed with condensate or other liquid, and the sprinklers or shower heads 11 have the purpose of doing this by supplying said condensate or other liquid to the upper part of the various coolers. The conduit 12 for conveying air supplies heated air from the second cooler to the mixing point 13, from which said air is conveyed together with flue gases from the droplet separator 5 to the flue gas fan 6. Conduit 14 conveys condensate from coolers 2, 3, and 4 to the collecting vessel 8. Conduits 15 are used for supplying cooling water, whereas conduits 16 are used for removing cooling water.
