# DISCHARGE LAMP OPERATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An inverter 6 generates a high frequency output having a pulsating envelope, and its output circuit in cludes two resonant circuits 20, 21 , which are set such that their respective resonant frequencies f₁, f₂ are made substantially equal and constant irrespective of the im pedance of a high pressure discharge lamp 17 .
