## Description
D E S C R I P T I O N GLYCEROL DERIVATIVESSummary The present invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives. More particularly, this invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives having antagonistic effect on platelet activating factor abbreviated as PAF. hereafter , hypotensive effect like PAF, inhibitory effect on phspholipase and further, inhibitory effect on growth of tumour cell of induction of differentiation, and furthermore, this invention is concerned to the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredients.Background Recently, the study on the release reaction of active amine dependent on leukocyte from platelet, has been erzrgetically carried out. As a result, a substance strongly irducing platelet aggregation was discovered and it was named as PAF cf. J. Immunol., 106, 1244 1971 , J. Exp. Med., 136, 1 .56 1972 and Nature, 249, 581 1974 . Thereafter, it was confirmed that PAF exists in various animals including human Flings. In 1979, its chemical structure was identified cf. . Biol. Chem., 254, 9355 1979 and C. R. Acad. Sci., Sepia D Paris , 289, 1017 1979 J ad has turned out to be a mixture of two alkylphospholipids of the following general formula wherein n is 15 or 17 cf. J. Biol. Chem., 255, 5514 1980 2 EMI2.1 wherein n represents 15 or 17. It was found that PAF has not only strong secretory effect on platelet aggregation known at that time, but also powerful hypotensive effect and bronchoconstricting effect as. physiological effects. PAF is considered to be one of platelet aggregating factors in human beings, and further, one of substances inducing allergy and inflammation. Accordingly, there is a great possibility that compounds having antagonistic effect on PAF inhibitory effect on PAF may become an precedented platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent. Furthermore, PAF is considered to become a hypotensive agent without inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. by selecting hypotensive effect out of various effect Prior arts Being interested in physiological effect on PAF, we have carried out widespread investigations in order to discover compounds similar to PAF in their chemical structure and possessing antagonistic effect on PAF or hypotensive effect like PAF.We have found that the above purpose can be accomplished by glycerol derivatives which are replaced the hydroxy group at the first position of the glycerol skeleton by an alkoxy group and are replaced the hydroxy group at the third position thereof by an alkoxy group substituted by a primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary amine, preferebly tertiary or quaternary amine. For example, our European Patent Publication No.94,586 discloses the compounds of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein AÚ is O or S , BÚ is O or S , DÚ is Oor OC , R11 is alkyl R21 is H, benzyl, acyl, N suk,tituted amido when B1 is O , or R21 is alkyl, benzyl or alkoxy thiocarbonyl when B1 is S , R31 is alky.ene and R41 is amino, mono or dialkyl substituted amino or trialkyl substituted ammonium and our European Pateit Publication No. 109,255 disclose the compounds of the gene al formula EMI4.1 wherein A2 is O or OCO , R12 is alkyl, R22 is azido, amino, acylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino or ureido, R32 is alkylene and R 2 is amino, mono or dialkyl substituted amino or trialkyl substituted ammonium . Now, we have found that by inducing a phenylene group into the side chain of the 3rd position of the glycerol skelton, and by limiting optionally substituted amino group attached to the end of the 3rd position thereof the tertiary or quaternary amine, new glycerol derivatives are most active in antagonistic effect on PAF than glycerol derivatives previously proposed, having completed this invention On the other hand, glycerol derivatives similar to those of the present invention n chemical structure are disclosed in the German Patent Publication No. 2,835,369.Broad scope of compound is disclosed therein and the compounds of the general formula EMI4.2 wherein R13 and R23 each represents a normal alkyl or alkenyl group of 12 to 20 carbon atoms, yl and Z1 each represent alkylene group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, o , m or p phenylenedimethylene group, a group of general formula EMI5.1 wherein qq represents an integer of from 1 to 3 and the left bond was attached to the oxygen atom. or a group of general formula EMI5.2 wherein the left bond was attached to the oxygen atom. or ...., R33 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkvl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms or ..., mm, nn and pp each represents zero or 1 and the total number of mm, nn and pp is zero or 1. are most related to our invention. The difinition not related to our invention is removed from the above description. As understood from the above definition, NHR3 in formula A in De 2,835,369 represents only a primary or secondary amine, which R4 in the general formula I hereinafter described, of the present invention represents a tertiarv or quaternary amine. Furthermore, the distinguished difference between the present invention and the invention disclosed inDE 2,835,369 is utility of glycerol compounds. That is, compounds of the present invention have antagonistic effect onPAF and hypotensive effect like PAF and, therefore, are used as platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent and anti inflammatory agent, whereas compounds in DE 2,835,369 have stimulating activity of production of interferon and are useful for prophylaxis of viral disease. As discussed above, the present invention is remarkably different from the invention disclosed inDE 2,835,369 in chemical structure and their utility. The present invention is not anticipated and not obvious fromDE 2,835,369.Additional activities Furthermore, it has been found that the compound of the present invention of the general formula I have inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C.Phospholipase A2 and Phoapholipase C dependent on calcium in a living body are concerned in the mechanism of the release of arachidonic acid from phosphlipids. It is known that arachidonic acid is released by physiological stimulus and then become incorporated into the metabolic routes of prostaglandins and is finally metabolized to thromboxane A2 having a strong effect on platelet aggegation, to other prÏstaStAandt s or to various leukotrienes being a significant brdnchoconstrictor in an asthmatic paroxysm. Accordingly, it is considered that compounds having an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and pKospholipase C, which are concerned in the mechanism for the release of arachidonic acid, can become a platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthamatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent, based on the inhibition of phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, having a different mechanism from PAF antagonist and further, being different from conventional non steroid anti inflammatory agents represented by aspire based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase.
