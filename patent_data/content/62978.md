## Description
TITLE APPARATUS FOR ASSISTING FAULT FThDII IN DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS This invention relates to apparatus for assisting fault finding or debugging in data processing systems including central processing units hereinAfter called CPUs and more particularly although not exclusively to such systems incorporating microprocessors. The developmcnt of computer software to operate in a real time computer system, ie respond to external stimuli or events in the real world, has traditionally been a difficult task requiring a high degree of Hardware and software expertise.The manufacturers of mainframes and minicomputers have responded to this problem by offering sophisticated operating systems and other supporting software tools which provide a well engineered environment within which a large class of real time system can be developed and run for their particular computer haldwale.The operating system, or real time executive, usually provides facilities and interfaces for handling the asynchronous characteristics of an application system, whilst the other softvare tools such as editors1 assemblers, language compilers and linkers provide the normal facilities for preparing and comstructing application program However these tools usually give little, if any, assistance with the task of testing and debugging the real time nature of the software they are used to produce.The task of developing real time program for use in microprocessors has to overcome a number of additional problems not usually encountered when using established mainframes or minicomputers These additional problems include the target microprocessor for which the programs are intended does not have the hardware andZor software resources necessary to support a viable program development environment the applications uhich use microprocessors utilise unusual I O devices for which there is neither any standard operational software nor any standart interface FUrthertnorc, one of the most int table asp ect of dd lgg ng real time programs is the unr eatability of problems occurring as a result of real time interactions. Conventional debugging procedures frequently have the effect of changing the operation of the computer System of interest, so that the problem to be corrected may e t De absent or altered by the use of the debugg s process It is on object of the present intention to provide an appar for assisting fault finding in data processing systems, the apparatus having improved capability for detecting faults arising from real time interactions. The present invention provides an apparatus for assisting faultfinding in a data processing system having a target CPU and a program under test, the apparatus including means for detecting and recording data input and interrupt signals applied to the CPU during program execution and derived from external stimuli, means for measuring and recording the occurrence time of such signals relative to the CPUs time frame and means for replaying the program under test in synchronous combination with the recorded data input and interrupt signals applied at appropriate relative occurrence times. The advantage of the invention is that the logical behaviour of the CPU during real time execution of the program may be reproduced repeatedly during replay and any real time faults are permanently available for tracing and correction. The CPU may be a microprocessor. The data input and interrupt signals are recorded by means adapted to detect signals on the CPU bus without affecting CPU operation. The signal occurrence time is preferably measured by means adapted to count CPU instruction fetch events and to record the instantaneous count thereof at signal detection. The means for replaying the program under test and the recorded signals may conveniently be a host computer incorporating a simulator program arranged to simulate target CPU operation and to reconstruct target data read and interrupt events from the recorded data input and interrupt signals. The apparatus preferably includes a backing store to receive input data and input signals together with their instantaneous count. The monitoring means may comprise a bus nonitoring unit connected to the target CPU bus and operative to produce for each monitored signal a digital output consisting of an event code, an occurrence time event count derived from the counting means, a data word, an external port address and the low order byte of an instruction address.The nor.itoring means majf also mclule a data reduction unit for compressing stored input data and a data transmission unit for t.xaslr.ission of stored input data and interrupt event infort ation to the backing store. woven incorporatin a host computer and simulator program for relay of t. c program under test, t.e apparatus is preferably arranged to transfer to the host computer the program under test, the target CPU initial state and the external stimuli record contained in the backing store. The program under test is then replayed on the simulator programmed host computer in combination with the information derived from the external stinuli. In this rrag, the real time target execution of the program under test is permanently available for tracing and correction of faults including those arising from real time interactions. In order that the invention might be more fully understood, embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram illustrating monitoring of program execution on a target computer, Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram illustrating program execution replay, and Figure 3 is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of the invention arraged for recordal and replay using a host computer Referring to Figure 1, a target computer system 10 comprises a central processing unit or CPU II, a memory unit 12 containing thc program to be executed or tested, and an input output interface unit 13 connected to a bus 14.The interface unit 13 is connected to an external apparatus 15 for which the target system 10 processes data. A record keeper 16 is connected to the bus 14 by connections 17, 18 and 19 representing the lines which carry the input read and interrupt acknovledge signals and input data respectively. An instruction fetch line 20 is connected to a timing counter 21, and the counter output is connected to the record keeper 16 having a backing store 22. The record keeper 16, timing counter 21 and connections thereto are collectively termed an action replay monitor 23. The arrangement of Figure 1 operates as follows. The record keeper 16 monitors the bus 14 for input activity and records input da interrupt requests and time of interrupt. The timing counter 21 provides the interrupt time by counting the regular instruction fetch events on the bus 14. The counter 21 is finite in size and periodically overflows, so the record keeper records each overflow event for additional time monitoring. The bucking store 22 stores sequentially the record produced by the record keeper 16. Referrin now to Figure 2, a replay controller 30 includes a backing store 31 conta iing thc record of snforration producai by the record keeper 16 of Figure 1. The replay controller 30 contains a record player 32 connected to an interrupt time register 33. A comparator circuit 34 is connected to compare outputs of the interrupt time register 33 and a timing counter 35. The instruction fetch line 19 of the bus 14 is connected to an input of the timing counter 35, and the interrupt request line 18A is connected to the output of comparator circuit 34. The record player 32 is connected to the interrupt request, input fetch and input data lines of the bus 14. The. arrangement of Figure 2 operates as follows. The record of events in the backing store 31, produced by means of the Figure 1 apparatus, is employed to supply input data and interrupt signals to the target system 10. The record player 32 reconstructs the original events recorded from the bus 14, and feeds these recorded events to the bus 14 to effect re execution of the original program instructions. Time is measured by counting instruction fetch signals with a counter 35 identical to the orginal counter 21. The comparator unit 34 generates an appropriate interrupt request signal when elapsed time in the counter 35 matches the interrupt time in the register 33 and requests the record player 32 to update the interrupt time register 33. every time the counter 35 overflows, the record player 32 ticks off an overflow record. livery time the CPU 11 is detected trying to read from an input port, the record player 32 provides the CPU with the appropriate piece of recorded data. In the instance where the CPU may respond to a number of different types of interrupt requests, it is necesary for the action replay monitor 23 to additionally record the type as well as the time of each interrupt. The replay controller has then to generate the right type of interrupt request at the appropriate time. Other ways of measuring the time of events include counting other types of regular signals, such asCPU clock signals1 real time clock signals or bus transaction signals.In order to minimize the occurrence of overflow during such counting it is possible to combine this periodic counting with the counting of less regular events, for exanpre, input output operations, or CPU events such as the execution of jump instructions. To reduce the rate and quantity of data to be stored, the record keeper may carry out data compression procedures, eg counting con secutive Adent El data inputs, and storing only one copy, together with the count. The record player would then rezonstruct the actual sequoce. To check for the possibility of the re execution diverging from the orignal due to unforeseen differences between the original hardvare and the replay system, it may be preferable to record extra information together with that necessary for replay eg the program address during an interrupt, the time of an input operation, the identity of the input port involved . During reply this extra information would be used by the replay controller to check for divergence. As will be apparent to skilled electronic engineers the action replay monitor 23 and replay controller 30 might conveniently be a single unit having common elements storage device, timing counter etc for equivalent functions. The unit would be switchable between record and replay modes. Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown a further embodiment of the invention arranged for monitoring and replay using a host computer.An Intel 8085 target microcomputer 41 has a 40 pin CPU socket 42 connected to an action reply monitor ARM 43 via an action replay probe 44. A conventional in circuit emulator ICE 45 is connected to the probe 44 and CPU socket 42 by an ICE plug 46. The AZfl 43 is connected to a storage unit 47 in the form of a Hewlett Packard EP 85 desktop computer programmed to accept and store a stream of data presented to it via its standard serial input output port. The storage unit 47 and ICE 45 are connected to a host comuter 48 having a visual display unit VD 49. The ARM 43 consists of a CPU bus monitor unit BM J , a data reduction unit DRE and a data transmission unit DTU not shorn individually .Via the AIM probe 44, the BMU detects events occurring within the microprocessor 41 from the signals on the microprocessor pins in the CPU socket 42. The BMU detects microprocessor opoode fetches, interrupt activity and input port reads. The Intel 8085 microprocessor can accommodate up to 256 input ports, and the ARM 43 is correspondingly arranged to cope with up to 256 different port addresses. For each event detected by the BMU, a package of information comprising an event code together with bytes of data and addresses as appropriate is placed into a hardware first in first out FIFO queue thus allowing the BHU to carry out monitoring at full speed. The FtEFO is a 44 bit, 16 position unit accommodating a 16 bit count, a 4 bit event code, an 8 bit data ward, an 8 bit nor. actress and the loç order byte of an instruction address. The BMU o has a 16 bit counter which counts opcodc fetc s to microprocessor execution time. The B S notifies input events to the DW, and each interrupt with associated count and each counter overflow event is notified to the DTU. The DRU carries out a degree of data reduction on input events appearing at the head, or output of the BNU s FIFO queue. The DW examines the information associated with each input event to establish whether a the new input data from a port is identical to the immediately preceding data from that port, or b the new input data is different, and the previous data has been seen more than once, or c the new input data is different, but the previous data has been seen once or not at all. In the case of a ,the DRU merely increments the count for the relevant port. In the case of b ,the DTU is required to transmit the new data together with the count for the previous data, whereas for c the DTU is required to transmit only the new data. In order to furnish the DTU with inforration for transmission, the DRU has a 256 by 24 bit table in which it can enter and update a data byte together with a 16 bit count for each of the possible 256 ports of the Intel 8085 microprocessor. The DTD responds to the input events notified by the DIU and the interrupt and counter overflow events notified by the BMU, and transnits the relevant items of information to the storage unit 47 over a standard RS 232 serial link. It has an industry standard UNAPT UniversalAsynchronous Receiver Transmitter with a 64 position, 8 bit FIFO queue on the input. For each type of event, the DTU control routes an appropriate sequence of information bytes into the FIFO. The host computer 48 has a similar program in the programming language C . The program is arranged to reconstruct the external inputs seen by the target microprocessor 41 from the data captured by the ARM 43. The principles of microprocessor simulator programs are well known in computer technolog3t for the purposes of simulating microprocessor operations.The simulator employed on the host computer 48 is equivalent to a conventional simulator modified to accept external stimuli stored sequentially. As will be described later, the host computer 48 stores the program under test PUT used by the target microcomputer 41. In additio , afterLPUT has run on the target, data recorded in the storage unit 47 is transferred to a data file on the sort. The s r.ulator program reconstructs events occurring on the target 41 for tole purpose of performing on the host a replay of the target PUT execution.To reconstruct interrupt events, the simulator maintains a count of opcode fetches as in the BHU. when the next event in the data file is an interrupt and the stored BMU count in the data file equals the simulator s count, an interrupt of the correct type is simulated. To reconstruct data read from target input ports, the simulator maintains a table in the host similar to that in the DREW. Thus when the PUT instructs the simulator to do a read from an input port, and the next event in the data file is not associated with that port, the simulator will assume that the data read is in its table, and increment the count for that port. If the next event is a count overflow on that port, the simulator will simply zero the count in its table. If the next event is a read where the previous data had been read more than once, the simulator will co pare the count in its table with the count in the event record if identical1 the old data in the table is discarded, and the new data inserted, and presented to the PUT. The new count will be set to 1. This updating will occur anyway if the next event is a read where the previous data had not been seen more than once. The arrangement of Figure 3 operates as follows. The PUT to be executed on the target microcomputer 41 is generated on the host computer 48 by the user operating the VDU 49, making use of standard programmIng tools available on the host. The PUT is then trsnsxmitted into the memory of the target via the ICE 45, which is a commercially available system. The host 48 then commands the ICE to transmit the target s internal state back for storage in an initial state file of the host. The internal state consists of the contents of the target memory and registers. The target microcomputer 41 is then made to execute the PUT. The ARM 439 or BMtJ DIU Dr J combination, captures all information necessary for replay, compresses it, and transmits it to the storage unit 47. At the end of the PUT run, the data captured in the storage unit 47 is transmitted to the host computer 48 and stored in a data file of the host. Replay of the PUT execution is then achieved by running the 8inulator program on the host. The simulator models the behaviour of the 8085 micro processor. It initialises its model of the microprocessor and memory from the initial state file, and then pro eeds to execute the PUT contained therein. The simulator uses the contents of its data file captured by the ACH 43 to recreate the inputs siren by the target during monitoring, thus ensuring that the FZ T follows e actly the same sequence of operations on the host as during the original execution by the target. The simulator provides the user with a set of commands to allow him to control and observe the replay execution of the PUT, so that faults may be repeated and traced for subsequent correction. The invention provides the important advantage that hitherto unrepeatable real time faults in program execution become permanently available for study and correction. The invention produces a record of external stimuli experienced by the CPU, and reconstructs those stimuli to provide a re execution of the original program in undistorted form.During re execution or replay, the user is free to investigate the behaviour of the program without regard to the real time constraints which existed during the original execution.Accordingly, the user need not fear that his investigations will distort the program execution.
