As shown in Figure 1, the shear pin coupling 1 comprisas a first coupling member 2, which is mounted on a driving shaft 3, which may, for example, be the power take off shaft of a tractor. The shear pin coupling also comprises a second coupling member 4, which has, on the side facing away from the first coupling member 2, fork prongs 6 of a universal coupling.This coupling may, for example, be one of a set of universal couplings of an auxiliary shaft aot shown , as is conven tionall mployed between a power take off Thaft of a tractor and an input or driven shaft of an agricultural implement. he first coupling member 2 comprises a circular flange 6 seeFigure 3 and is provided on the side facing away from the coupling member 4 with a cylindrical boss 7. The boss 7 has at leas one radial bore accommodating a ball 8, which is urged radiall inwardly by a set scre aving a conical end into a groove 11 in the driving shaft 3. In this way the coupling 1 is axially firmly connected with the driving shaft 3. The driving shaft 3 is provided with splines 12 which co operate with corresponding splines in the first coupling member 2 to couple the driving shaft 3 and the first coupling member 2 for rotation together.On the side facing the second coupling member 4 the flange 6 has one or more in this embodiment, twelve guide slots 13 extending radially from mear the shaft 3 to the periphery of the flange 6. Each slot 13 is susstantiall rectangular in tangential cross section. The coupling member 2 also comprises a comparatively thin, circular disc 14, which has, near the shaft 3, a hub 13. The hub 15 fits coaxially with in the central portion of the flange 6 see Figure 3 . ub 15 has splines co operating with th spli 12. The 14 contacts the side of the flange 6 facing the second coup ling menber 4.The dise 14 has, on the side member 4, a portion 16 of larger diameter than the 1 . e first coupling member 2 also has a ring 17 surr outer pariphery of the flange 6. The ring 17 has openings or recesses 18 which are in register with the ts 13. The ring 17 is fastened to the flange 6 by means of counter un see figure 2 .Reforring in particular to Figure 6 und ring 17 comprises a main part 20 extending up to the ference of the coupling and narrower part 21 termin tin at a distance from the periphery, the cylindrical cir of the narrower part 21 corresponding to that of the Figure 3 . Figure 7 shows that each opening 18 sidewalls. These walls are located for the in portion 20. rocess 22 is provido in the 20 behind each opening 18 with respect to the of operative rotation of the she pin coupling indi the arrow A in Figure 2. The area of this recc s er to the rotary axis 3A is located at a small distanoc neighbouring surface of the main portion 20. Vi direction of rotation, the length of each recess s equal to, and preferably about double, the smallest tangs dimension of the opening 18.The flange 6 is connected to disc 14 by four bolts 23. The second coupling member 4 comprises a circular 24, which is provided with the fork prongs 5 and which entend radially as far as the cylindrical outter surface of the portion 20. Near the circumference the plate 24 has a rim 25, which is also adjacent the circumference of the er surface. The rim 25 is, on its inner side, adjac circumference of the disc 14 and extends towards the ring As is shown in Figure 1, the end part of the rim 25 from the prongs 5 is located a small distance away from the neigh bouring side of the main portion 20.This distance is preferably about 2 mis. he rim 25 has a recess 26 rece a cutting plate 27. The cutting plate 27 is secured to the plate 24 by countersund serews 2 . The cutting late 27 is located in the leading part of the recess 26, as viewed in the direction of erative rotation A, and is substantially rectungular, as viewed rudially Figure 4 . The side of the cutting plate 27 acing the main portion 20 engages the adja cent surface of the main portion 20 see Figure 4 . The relain ing part of the rocess 26 bounded by the cutting plate 27 forms an opening 29 having rudially extending sidewalls, the shape of which substenti lly corresponds with that of the side walls of the opening 18.The recess 26 is covered onits ra dially outer side by a cover l t 30, which is connected with the rim 23 two bolts 31. The cover plate 30 exterds across the 20 see Figures and and, art 3 , covers the opening adj the opening 29 in a radial, outward direction. e opening 23 is ot couvered by the cover ate 30 in radial, outward direction.The plat 24 has near its centre a bere which goes only lthe way through the tic es of the plate 24. here receives a retaining plate 33 whic is fastoned to the part 16 of the diso 14 by countersnnl screwe 34. this way the econd ling member 4 is rigidl xially secured to the first coup ling member 2. s can be seen in Figures 2 and 3, cac slot 13 accom modates a plurality of shear pins 36 and a compression spring 35, which tends to push the shoar 36, which re arr comprising a radially extending row, towards the circunforence of the shear pin coupling. The shcar pins of cach row are disposed in their slot 13 so that their contre lines lie in a common radial plane. One end part of the spring located near the Lub 15 in a spring guide 37, whereas on the side remote from the hub 15 the spring 35 exerts pres sure on a pressure pin 38.The spring guide 37 and the pres sure pin 38 each have a rectangular cross section to match that of the slot 13. The pins 36 in the slot 13 preferably extend axially with respect to the rotary axis 3A. Each slot 13 may contain about 3 to 6 pins in this embodiment, they each contain 4 pins. The shear pin coupling described above operates as follows. During operation the shear pin coupling is provided between the output shaft of a power source and the shaft of, mechanism to be driven. The shear pin coupling may be employed in many dirfferent situations, but in this enbodiment it is arranged in the end portion of an auxiliary shaft having two universal couplings, in which, as stated above, the first coupling member 2 is connected with the power take off shaft 3 of a tractor not shown . The two coupling members 2 and 4 are interconnected for rotation together by a shear pin 36A.The part of this shear pin 36A which is disposed in the first coupling member 2 about the rear sidewall of the opening 18, as viewed in the direction of rotation A, this side wall ensuring by its concave shape a satisfactory transfer of forces from the sidewall to the adjacent part of the shear pin 36A. This part of the shear pin is retained against radially outward movement by the part 32 of the cover plate 30.The part of the shear pin 36A which is located in the second coup ling member 4 lies in the opening 29 and is in contact with the leading sidewall of the opening 23, as viewed in the dir ection of rotation A, this sidewall comprising the side of the cutting plate 27, the surface of this side also matching the cylindrical surface of the shear pin. Preferably about one third of the length of the shear rin 36A is located in the opening 18 and the other two thirds are located in the opening 29. The openings 18 and 19 have, as viewed in a tangential direction, a larder dimension than the diameter of the shear pins 36 and 36A.This excess is preferably about 40 . The part of the shear pin located in the opening 29 is not covered by the cover plate 30. As viewed in an axial direction, the length of the openings 18 and 29 is only slightly larger than the axial length of the shear pins 36 and 36A respcetively. If the coupling is overloaded, which will occur at a torque depending upon the choice of characteristics for the shear pin 36, the cutting plate produces a sharply defined fracture and prevents damage of the rim 25, whilst damage of the ring 17 can be avoided by making it from hardoned material. After fracture of the shear pin 36A the coupling member 4 will come to a standstill, whilst the broken off part of the shear pin 36A located in the opening 29 can emerge unhindered in a radial direction.The part of the shear pin remaining in the opening 10 will continue rotating with the first coupling member 2, which rotation results in relative rotation between the two coupling membros 2 and 4. Thus the opeing 18 moyes out from beneath the cover plate 30 so that the shear pin part can be ejected from the opening 18. This ejection is facilitated by the centrifugal force exerted on the shear pin. oreover, since the rim 25 and the main portion 20 are a small distance apart from one another, any uneven fracture between the two parts of the broken down shear pin should not result in jamming. The recess 22 located behind the opening 18, as viewed in the direction of rotation A, further facilitates the escape of the shear pin part.After the broken parts of the shear pin have been removed from the openings 18 and 29 respectively, a next following shear pin 36 can move out of one of the slots 13 into a pesition for connecting the two coupling members. However, with the conventional speed of the power take off shaft, which is about 540 rev min. it is not possible for the next shear pin to be urged in a radial outward direction.This is because the tangential dimension of the opening 29 is intentionally chosen so that the sum of the force of the spring 35 and the centrifugal force exerted on the row of shear pins is not sufficient, at the normal operating speed of the power takeoff shaft, to give the shear pin, having a known mass, an acceleration sufficient to bridge the distance between t original position and the connecting position during the instant when the opening 29 is in register with the opening It is important for the spring force to diminish proportionally to the reduced total mass of the row of shear pine shear pins are used up.The critical speed at which the spring is capable of displacing a new shear pin into a new necting position is preferably chosen so that this speed is below the minimum speed of the power take off shaft corresponding to idling of the driving engine. With a Diesel engine, for example, this critical speed at which the connection is re established may be about 150 revolutions per minute. The movement of a shear pin into a new connecting position is limited in a ra dial direction by the part 32 of the cover plate 30 forming a stop. After the coupling is re established, the shear pin coupling is again capable of transferring the driving . In this way the construction according to the inventio vides protection from overload for a long time w the ing to renew shear pins after each overload. Four in each of twelve slots 13 can re establish the dri nection after overload 48 times in succession. T the shear pins have been used, the shear pin coupling ca again be filled by removing the cover plate 30.By turnin the rim 25 with respect to the main portion 20 the opening 2 can be brought into register with all of the openings 18 in suscession, so that the shear pins can be inserted into the slots 13. After all the slots have been filled and the cover plate 30 is refitted, the shear pin coupling 1 is again ready for use Whilst various features of the shear in coupling that have been desoribed, and that are illustrated in the drawin will be set forth in the following olaims as inventive feat it is to be noted that the invention is not necessar ly j to these features and that it encompasses all of the that have been described both individually and in i nations
