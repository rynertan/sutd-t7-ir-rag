# Method of temperature compensating leak rate testing.

## Abstract
A method of compensating for temperature variations in testing part cavities for leaks by placing a fluid pressure source 10 in communication with the cavity 12 and measuring the flow rate to the cavity to determine the rate of any leakage. The method establishes a temperature compen sation function by measuring the shift in flow rates resulting from changes in temperature of a sample test part, which temperature compensation function allows correction of the flow rates during subsequent testing according to the sensed temperature of the test part. Flow rates are measured at two differing temperatures to determine the temperature com pensation function by linear regression, since the flow rate shift with temperature varies substantially linearly.
