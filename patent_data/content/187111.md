# Solenoid valve.

## Abstract
A normally open, solenoid controlled valve includes a stationary valve seat spindle 37 and a cylindrical valve sleeve 140 encircling and slideable along part of the valve seat spindle 37 . The valve seat spindle 37 has an annular control edge 80 and the valve sleeve 140 includes a pres sure responsive surface 82 which is reciprocably moved into and out of valve closing contact with the control edge 80 . The valve seat spindle 37 includes a flow passage 36, 36 therein extending to and discharging into a plenum re gion 81 formed radially inward of the control edge 80 between the spindle 37 and the sleeve 140 . The pressure responsive surface 82 of the valve sleeve 140 is a substan tially continuous frustrum of a cone whose apex extends in the direction of the valve opening and which extends radially outward from a sleeve inner diameter A to an outer diameter C point C of discontinuity in that surface. Point C is radially outward of the spindle 37 and sleeve centerline at least as far as the point of intersection, B , with that frustoconical pressure responsive surface 82 of a line normal to the sur face and extending through the control edge D 80 when the sleeve is fully open. The minimum radial positioning of dis continuity point C is a function of the angle of the pressure responsive surface 82 and the stroke of the sleeve 140 . The high pressure plenum 81 is structured to enhance the valve opening rate.
