# Co hydrogenation with molybdenum on wide pore carbon catalysts.

## Abstract
New catalysts comprising molybdenum on supports of defined wide pore carbons are useful as catalyst for reaction of CO with H₂ for synthesis of hydrocarbons. Catalysts may be made by depositing Mo CO ₆ on the carbon support particles by vapor deposition or solution impregnation. The catalyst may also comprise a second metal, such as rhodium or palladium.
