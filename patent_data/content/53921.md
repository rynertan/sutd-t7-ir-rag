## Description
AGGREGATESThis invention relates to the treatment of particulate material to form aggregates and is particularly concerned with the formation of briquettes.The conventional method of preparing briquettes is by mixing the particulate material such as coal, charcoal, ore powder and the like with starch, molasses, ground maize, dextrines, borax, lime, silica, ammonium lignosulphonates, pitch or other binding materials. The particular binding material used is determined by cost, the final properties required of the dried briquettes, the internal cohesive strength of the briquette before drying the green strength , the ease of release from the moulds during processing, the storage conditions of the briquettes and other circumstances.Binders such as starch, molasses, ground maize, dextrines and the like form viscous mixtures with water thus imparting good green strength to particulate matter.These binders ara, however, difficult to incorporate with particulate materials, require high levels of water to wet out the particles and produce final briquettes which have little water resistance. Aqueous mixes of borax, lime, silica and ammonium lignosulphonates are generally of low viscosity and impart little green strength to the particulate materials in the moulding stage, as well as leaving undesirable residues after incinerating the briquette 5. Pitch has to be melted at high temperatures before it can be used in the moulding process and the formed briquettes have again to be heated to high temperature to achieve final strength and remove undesirable volatiles present.Quality, price and availability of natural binders varies from time to time and from place to place. It is an object of the present invention to produce aggregates of particulate material, and particularly briquettes, using predominantly synthetic polymers as binders which are of consistent quality and availability and which have surprisingly improved properties having regard to conventional aggregates of briquettes.According to the invention, a method of aggregating particulate material includes the step of mixing the material with the reaction product of a an aqueous emulsion of a synthetic polymer which contains acidic groups or groups convertible to acidic groups, which are reactable with a basic substance to cause swelling or solution of the polymer, and to cause an increase in viscosity of the emulsion and b a basic substance in an amount sufficient to neutralize at least some of the acidic groups and then forming a desired form of aggregate by known techniques.The increase in viscosity is achieved with an increase in pH and is generally accompanied by a change in colour to clear or opalescent.Generally, such synthetic polymer emulsions are referred to as alkali soluble thickeners which term is used herein to include polymer emulsions which are not truly alkali soluble but more correctly only alkali swellable . Essentially all increase the viscosity of aqueous systems, the extent to which such thickening occurs being dependent on many factors some related to the chemical composition of the thickener and some to the other ingredients in the aqueous system.In the preferred form, alkali is added to the low viscosity alkali soluble emulsion after it has been intimately mixed with the particulate material. However, equally good results are obtained if the polymer is solubilised or swollen by the addition of alkali before or during its addition to the particulate material.For certain uses and circumstances it may, for optimum briquette production, be necessary to incorporate more than one alkali soluble emulsion and also a conventional polymer emulsion, wetting agent or surfactant, antifoam compound and the like.Although a wide range of ratios of alkali soluble emulsions to particulate materials is possible, surprisingly good results having regard to green strength, mould release, water insensitivity, final dry strength and other properties may be obtained with ratios of the order of 0,25 of alkali soluble polymer by mass on dry particulate material.The level of alkali soluble polymer used should be from 0,1 to about 10 by mass of the particulate material, but obviously the optimum amount will depend on the nature of the particulate materii and the required properties. For a chrome ore briquette the amount of alkali soluble polymer can be about 0,15 for anthracite about 0,60 and for charcoal about 1,0 by mass on the particulate material.The preferred acid monomers used in producing the alkali soluble thickener are unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with the emulsion also containing acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters of an alcohol having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, especially methyl acrylate or ethyl acrylate. Suitable alkali soluble emulsions can also be obtained by incorporating other unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers, some with subsequent modification,to achieve the described effects on addition of alkali e.g. acrylonitrile and its subsequent hydrolysis. The composition and manufacture of such products are widely disclosed in the literature. British Patent 870,994 discloses the preparation of aqueous emulsion copolymers of methacrylic acid and a lower C1 C4 alkyl acrylate and its thickener effect upon neutralisation. U.S.Patent 4,138,381 discloses thickeners incorporating at least one unsaturated carboxylic acid of 3 6 carbon atoms while U.S. Patent 3,657,175 discloses a composition being a mixture of meth acrylic acid, an ester of an ethoxylated alocohol and a balance comprising styrene, butadiene or mixture thereof.Various thickeners were prepared for use in theExamples that follow. All were produced by the generally well known and disclosed emulsion polymerisation techniques which are summarised as follows Equipment Stirred, heated cooled vessel fitted with condensor and facilities for adding monomers, catalysts, etc. at predetermined rates where necessary .Ingredients Aqueous phase Water typically 71,0 parts Stabilisers surfactants 3,0 Monomers C3 C6 unsatured carboxlic acid 10,0 parts C1 C4 alkyl acrylate 15,0 Molecular weight modifier 0,0 1,0Catalyst Redox system 0,02 Water 1,0Procedure Heat aqueous phase to 600C.Add 20 of the monomers and heat at 800C Add initial catalyst portion then the remaining monomer and catalyst over one hour.Cool and sample. Neutralise where preferred .Thickener A Prepared to the above procedure based on methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate with molecular weight optimised to achieve maximum viscosity on neutralisation. At pH 4,0 nonvolatile content is 25 and the viscosity is low less 100 c.p.s. . Non volatile content is reduced to 3 and at pH9, after neutralization, the viscosity is 35,000 c.p.a. Thickener B Similar to A above, but molecular weight and monomer ratio optimised to give a lower chemical solubility on neutralisation thus exhibiting greater wet tack i.e. the thickener is sticky and stringy . At pH 9,0, after neutralisation, nonvolatile content is 22 and viscosity Brookfield LVT 4 12 is 10,000 c.p.s. Example 1 The following examples illustrate that briquettes made with a particular alkali soluble polymer have excellent mould release properties, dry crushing strengths propott nal to the polymer levels used, but poor resistance to water and compares these with briquettes made from 2 natural organic binders.Briquettes of anthracite powder, the bulk of which was below 7,5mm in size, were prepared using, maize meal and thickener A as previously described .The following mixtures by mass were prepared A B C D E F G HWater 8,0 8,8 9,2 9,6 10,0 10,4 10,4 10,4 hot Thickener A solid contents 0,8 0,5 0,4 0,3 0,2 0,1 Ammonium hydroxide 0,3 0,2 0,2 0,2 0,2 0,1 Water soluble starch 2,5 Maize meal 6,0 Stygel Core Binder from African Products Pty Limited The ammonium hydroxide was added to pH 9 when the opaque, diluted thickener A turned clear and the viscosity increased .100 gram samples of dry anthracite powder were placed in the bowl of a planetary mixer and the above mixtures added with stirring.When thoroughly mixed the damp materials were placed in a perpendicular piston mould and subjected to compression under a pressure of 30 Kpa.It was noted that all the damp briquettes made using thickener A mixtures slipped unaided out of the mould under the force of gravity when the compression was removed. This resulted in none of the briquettes being damaged. In contrast, briquettes made using soluble starch and maize meal were less easy to remove. As a consequence, many of the briquettes broke in half. The ability of the freshly formed briquettes to withstand handling without breaking is referred to as green strength .The moulded mixtures were dried overnight at 600C in a forced air oven. After cooling, one briquette from each series was submerged in water for 5 hours.Another briquette from each series was kept dry.The resistance to crushing of the dry and wet briquettes were measured in a Houndsfield tensometer.The results were as follows Mould release A to F were all excellent. G andH were somewhat inferior.Crushing strengths A B C D E F G HDry 70 54 40 36 20 10 40 20Wet O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0The crushing strengths of the dry briquettes is linearly related to the amounts of thickener A present. 0,43 parts thickener A per 100 parts anthracite gives strengths equal to 2,5 parts soluble starch and twice the strength of briquettes bonded with 6 parts maize meal.All these briquettes completely disintegrated on submersion in water.Example 2With a different particulate material, chrome ore, different formulations of alkali soluble emulsions are required for optimum results.Chrome ore powder is a far coarser and less absorbant material than anthracite. It therefore requires a binder with high wet tack if it is to be moulded into briquettes of acceptable green strength .The following mixtures were prepared A B CWater 2,5 3,0 7,0Thickener A solids contents 0,1 Thickener B 0,2 0,2 Stygel Core Binder 2,5 As before, pH is adjustable with ammonium hydroxide to pH 9,0.Each of the above were added to 100 grams of chrome ore powder and thoroughly mixed in a planetary mixer.The damp materials were briquetted as in Example 1.When using thickener B far less water is required to wet out the chrome ore powder than is required when using thickener A or soluble starch. This is very significant as less drying is needed after moulding to achieve final strength.Mix A produced excellent briquettes with dry crushing strengths of 138 Kpa. There was, however, some evidence of sticking in the mould.Mix B produced excellent briquettes with dry crushing strengths of 148 Kpa and very good mould release properties.With Mix C difficulties were experienced with mould release but some satisfactory briquettes were produced. The crushing strengths were, however, lower at only 80 Kpa.The above indicates that thickener B at low levels gives good briquettes, but suspect mould release properties Mix A . The blend of thickener A and thickener B appears to give an ideal system for chrome ore Mix B . After 5 hours submersion in water all briquettes disintegrated to a similar extent.Example 3The water resistance of briquettes bound with alkali soluble or swellable polymers can be considerably upgraded by pre blending them with selected nonalkali soluble polymer emulsions.Although it is accepted that the water resistance of dried films of alkali solubilized polymers is poor,.this can be improved by using a volatile alkali such as ammonium hydroxide instead of fixed alkalis such as sodium or potassium hydroxide.However, even unneutralised films of the alkali soluble emulsions have inadequate water resistance for them to be used in the manufacture of briquettes which will be transported in bulk, and therefore exposed to the environment. The use of selected polymer emulsions to impart non wetting properties to particulate materials is well known. Blends of these polymers were made with the alkali soluble types.

Reverseal 5 is manufactured by Revertex S.A. Pty Limited.Each of the above were added to 100 gram of anthracite powder in a planetary mixer. After thorough mixing, the damp materials were used to mould briquettes as in example 1. After oven drying, one set of dry briquette S were subjected to crushing. Another set were immersed in water for 5 hours. The water uptakes and crushing strengths of these briquettes immediately after removal from the water were determined.

Briquettes from mix B had considerably fewer cracks, illustrating the practical advantage of lower level of added water.One set of each briquette were subjected to dry crushing and another to crushing after 5 hours in water.
