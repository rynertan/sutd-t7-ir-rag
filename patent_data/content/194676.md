## Description
The present invention relates to a thermal printer according to the preamble of claim 1. A thermal printer of the aforementioned type is known from EP A 0 114 989. Hitherto, in wire dot printers, the pitch between dots has been set to 0,353 mm and this pitch has generally been used in the world. Therefore, in most printers, it is required to set the lowest resolution of a graphic pattern which is printed into 0,353 mm. On the other hand, in the printer such as a thermal printer which requires a high resolution, to realize the printing at the pitch of 0,353 mm between dots, it is necessary to set the dot pitch of the thermal head into a 0,353 n n is an integer of 2 or more millimeter, for example, 0,176 mm, 0,118 mm or 0,088 mm. In this case, the number of heating elements which are used to constitute one dot increases with a decrease in n. When considering the practical use of the thermal printer, the high resolution characters printed by the thermal head having the heating elements which are arranged at the pitch of 0,176 mm between dots are slightly roughly observed. On the other hand, when the thermal head having the heating elements arranged at the pitch of 0,118 mm between dots is used, the high resolution characters having a high near letter quality can be printed with a high degree of fidelity. However, since it is necessary to arrange a number of heating elements in the limited space, it is difficult to manufacture such a kind of thermal head and its circuit arrangement also becomes complicated. Therefore, it is considered that it is advantageous to arrange the heating elements at the pitch of 0,141 mm between dots. Namely, it is desirable to perform the high density printing of high resolution printing at the dot pitch of 0,141 mm and execute the ordinary high speed printing at the dot pitch of 0,353 mm. However, hitherto, it has been considered that in the case where the dot pitch of 0,141 mm is used for the high density printing, only the dot pitch of 0,282 mm or 0,423 mm can be used for the high speed printing. Therefore, it has been considered that two sets of thermal heads are prepared and used by switching as necessary in order to effect the printing at the dot pitch of 0,141 mm or 0,353 mm. The use of two sets of thermal heads, however, is disadvantageous in terms of costs and causes the structure of printer to become complicated. It is an object of the present invention to provide a thermal printer which can execute the ordinary printing at a dot pitch different from the dot pitch which is integer times as large as the dot pitch for use in the high resolution printing. This object is accomplished by a thermal printer as is specified in the characterizing part of claim 1. Specific embodiments of the present invention result from the subclaims. According to the invention, the n bit data read out from the memory is converted into the N bit data in the high speed printing mode. Therefore, the mean value of the pitch between dots in high speed printing mode can be set to be different from the integer multiple of the dot pitch in the high resolution printing mode. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a thermal printer according to an embodiment of the present invention. This thermal printer comprises a central processing unit CPU 1 including an auxiliary register 1A therein, a read only memory ROM 2 in which a control program of CPU 1 is stored, and a random access memory RAM 3 for temporarily storing print data or the like. ROM 2 includes 11 bit and 32 bit character generators 2A and 2B. Character generators 2A and 2B have a plurality of character data constructed by 11 bits 10 columns and 32 bits 19 columns, respectively. Further, CPU 1 is connected to a carrier motor driver 4, a paper feed motor driver 5, and a solenoid driver 6. Carrier motor driver 4 drives a carrier motor 7 to drive a carrier 8. Feed motor driver 5 drives a paper feed motor 9 to transfer a printing paper. Solenoid driver 6 drives a solenoid 10 to drive a printing hammer 11. CPU 1 is also connected to a host computer 12 through an interface 13 and to a 32 bit printing buffer 14 for temporarily storing printing data. Printing buffer 14 is connected to a thermal head driver 15 to drive a thermal head 16 having thirty two heating elements according to the content of buffer 14. CPU 1 is further connected to a key 17 for setting the printing mode and a ribbon end sensor 18. Key 17 can be constituted by, for example, two key switches which are set at different switching positions, or by a single key switch to designate the printing mode in dependence on the ON OFF state. Ribbon end sensor 18 is constituted by, for example, a photoelectric converter for generating an output signal responsive to a ribbon end mark as is well known. Fig. 2 shows the relations between thirty two heating elements HG₁ to HG₃₂ of the thermal head 16 which are arranged in a straight line at the dot pitch of 0,141mm and eleven composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁ which are constituted by properly combining heating elements HG₁ to HG₃₂. As will be obvious from Fig. 2, composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁ are composed of heating elements HG₁ to HG₃, HG₃ to HG₅, HG₆ to HG₈, HG₈ to HG₁₀, HG₁₁ to HG₁₃, HG₁₃ to HG₁₅, HG₁₆ to HG₁₈, HG₁₈ to HG₂₀, HG₂₁ to HG₂₃, HG₂₃ to HG₂₅, and HG₂₆ to HG₂₈, respectively. Namely, each of heating elements HG₃, HG₈, HG₁₃, HG₁₈, and HG₂₃ is overlappingly used. Each of composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁ is constituted by three of heating elements HG₁ to HG₂₈. The hatched portions represent the overlap portions of the adjacent composite heating elements. It should be noted that eleven composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁ are formed from twenty eight heating elements HG₁ to HG₂₈. Namely, since the dot pitch of heating elements HG₁ to HG₂₈ is 0,141mm, the value of dot pitches DP regarding composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁ is about 0,353mm from the following expression. For example, the dot pitch between composite heating elements CH₁ and CH₂ is 0,282mm and the dot pitch between composite heating elements CH₂ and CH₃ is 0,423mm, so that the mean value of the dot pitches among composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₃ becomes 0,353mm. On the other hand, in the high resolution printing mode, the paper feed distance in each feeding cycle is set to a value which is 32 times as large as the size of the heating element. In the high speed printing mode, the paper feed distance is set to a value which is 28 times as large as the heating element. Thus, if a printing paper is fed by a distance of 32 0,141mm in the high speed printing mode, it is prevented that the white line is generated between lines each time the printing line is changed in the case of printing a graphic pattern or the like. CPU 1 detects whether the printing mode is set to the high speed printing mode A or high resolution printing mode B by key 17. CPU 1 selects one of character generators 2A and 2B in accordance with the designated printing mode and reads out the character data corresponding to the character code from host computer 12 from selected one of character generators 2A and 2B. The character data read out in this manner is stored into printing buffer 14 having thirty two bit positions 1 to 32 as shown in Fig. 3. Thermal head driver 15 drives thermal head 16 in accordance with the character data in printing buffer 14 to print a character. The character which is designated by the input character code in this manner is printed in accordance with the printing mode designated by key 17. Figs. 4A and 4B show character A which is printed by the thermal printer shown in Fig. 1 in the high speed printing mode and in the high resolution printing mode, respectively. Carrier 8 is driven at the speed of 40 cps in the high resolution printing mode and at the speed of 70 cps in the high speed printing mode. The operation of the thermal printer shown in Fig. 1 will then be described with reference to flow charts shown in Figs. 5 to 7. As shown in Fig. 5, thermal head 16 is first set in ON state in the printing operation mode. Thereafter, carrier 8 on which thermal head 16 is mounted is driven in accordance with the slow up routine, constant speed routine, and slow down routine which are preliminarily programmed. Namely, in the slow up routine, carrier 8 is slowly driven until it is accelerated to a preset speed and then driven at the constant speed equal to this preset speed. Thereafter, carrier 8 is slowly decelerated on the basis of the slow down routine. In the high resolution and high speed printing modes, CPU 1 gives drive data to carrier motor driver 4 so as to drive carrier 8 at the constant speed of 40 cps and 70 cps in the constant speed routine, respectively. In each routine, the ribbon end is checked. In response to an output signal from ribbon sensor 18. When the ribbon end is detected, carrier 8 is stopped and thermal head 16 is set in OFF state. While carrier 8 is being driven at the constant speed in accordance with the constant speed routine, thirty two heating elements in thermal head 16 are selectively energized on the basis of the character data which is printed. After completion of the slow down routine, carrier 8 is set to the home position and a check is made to see if there is a slack of ribbon or not. If there is a slack, the ribbon is adjusted to eliminate the slack and thermal head 16 is set in the OFF state. Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the printing operation. To execute the printing operation, CPU 1 first checks to see if the printable ribbon exists or not and then checks the printing mode. If CPU 1 detects by the state of key 17 that the high speed printing mode A has been set, CPU 1 reads out the 11 bit dot data corresponding to the input character code from character generator 2A and converts this 11 bit dot data into the 28 bit dot data in accordance with the procedure shown in Fig. 7 and stores into printing buffer 14. In the case where the high resolution printing mode B is set, CPU 1 reads out the 32 bit dot data from character generator 2B and stores into printing buffer 14. Thermal head driver 15 drives thermal head 16 in accordance with the dot data stored in printing buffer 14. CPU 1 stops the operation of head driver 15 after an expiration of a predetermined time t₁ or t₂ t₁ which is decided in dependence on the high speed printing mode or high resolution printing mode, respectively. Thereafter, CPU 1 checks to see if all of the data to be printed in one line have been completely printed or not. If it is NO, the dot data of the next column is read out from one of character generators 2A and 2B corresponding to the printing mode which is at present set and the operation similar to the above is executed. After completion of the printing of one line, a check is made to see if all of the character data designated by a command from host computer 12 have been printed or not. If it is NO, the ribbon end is again checked. After completion of the printing of all of the character data, the printing operation corresponding to the printing command from host computer in this cycle is finished. Fig. 7 is a flowchart showing the procedure to convert the character data read out from character generator 2A into the 28 bit dot data in the high speed printing mode. First, 0 is written in all bit positions 1 to 32 of printing buffer 14. Next, CPU 1 reads out upper eight bits of the 11 bit dot data from character generator 2A and stores into auxiliary register 1A. When bit B1 at the first bit position in auxiliary register 1A is 1 , 1 is stored in bit positions 1 to 3 of printing buffer 14. Similarly, when bits B₂ to B₈ at the second to eighth bit positions in auxiliary register 1A are 1 , 1 is written in bit positions 3 to 5 6 to 8 8 to 10 11 to 13 13 to 15 16 to 18 and 18 to 20 of printing buffer 14, respectively. For instance, when the 8 bit data from character generator 2A is 10101001 , the bit data of 11100111001110000111 is written in bit positions 1 to 20 of buffer 14. Next, CPU 1 reads out lower three bits of the 11 bit data from character generator 2A and stores in the first to third bit positions in auxiliary register 1A. When bits B₁ to B₃ at the first to third bit positions in auxiliary register 1A are 1 , 1 is stored in bit positions 21 to 23 23 to 25 and 26 to 28 of printing buffer 14, respectively. In this way, the 11 bit data from character generator 2A is converted to the 28 bit data having substantially the same content as the 11 bit data and stored into buffer 14. For instance, when the 3 bit data from character generator 2A is 010 , the dot data of 00111000 is written in bit positions 21 to 28 in buffer 14. Thus, the character or characters designated by the input character code are printed by composite heating elements CH₁ to CH₁₁. As described above, in the embodiment, the character data is printed at the dot pitch of 0,141mm in the high resolution printing mode, and the character data is printed at the dot pitch of 0,353mm different from the dot pitch which is integer times the 0,141mm in the high speed printing mode. Although the invention has been described above with respect to the embodiment, the invention is not limited to only this embodiment. For example, in the above embodiment, the composite heating elements were formed using heating elements HG₁ to HG₂₈ in a manner such that the mean value of the dot pitches becomes 0,353mm. However, in place of this or in addition to this constitution, it is also possible to form the composite heating elements such that the mean value of the dot pitches becomes 0,176mm by selectively using heating elements HG₁ to HG₃₂. The pitch between dots is not necessarily limited to 0,141mm, 0,353mm, or the like but may be set to a proper value as necessary. On one hand, the character data can be also directly printed on a thermal paper without using an ink ribbon. In this case, sensor 18 can be omitted. Further, although key 17 was used to set the printing mode, the printing mode setting data may be also generated from host computer 12 in place of key 17.
