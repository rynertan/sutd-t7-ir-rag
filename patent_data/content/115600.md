# Fruit colouring process.

## Abstract
A process for artificially colouring fruit characterised in that an aqueous medium containing the fruit is treated with a dye and an edible calcium salt at an elevated temperature until the desired quantity of dye penetrates the fruit tissue, then the pH is lowered at least to a value at which the dye becomes substantially insoluble, after which the pH is raised gradually while ensuring that the pH of the inner parts of the fruit does not exceed 7, and finally the fruit is separated from the aqueous medium.
