# A cant angle sensor.

## Abstract
A cant angle sensor comprises a conductive, nonmagnetic pendulum 24 suspended from the shaft 23 of a resolver 22 for limited angular travel in the slot 21 of a C shaped magnet 18 . When the angle of the sensor changes, the pendulum seeks a new vertical null, and the C shaped magnet exerts a viscous hysteresis damping force causing the pendulum to quickly come to rest without oscillation. The rotor magnet wire 29 of the resolver is connected directly to output terminals 32 to avoid friction due to brush contact on the rotor shaft 23 .

## Description
SPECIFICATION The invention relates to a sensor which gives an indication of a cant angle by means of an output from a resolver. Cant angle sensors which are used to give an indication of the tilt of a land vehicle are well known in the prior art. A pendulum which is suspended for angular motion seeks a vertical null position as the tilt of the sensor is changed, and the pendulum may be attached to the shaft of a resolver which develops an output signal indicative of this tilt angle. Because the resolver shaft is delicately balanced, the pendulum is prone. to oscillations about a vertical null point when a new null is being sought. Various damping means such as magnets in combination with a ferromagnetic pendulum have been used to limit these oscillations.The force exerted by the magnets on the pendulum requires the pendulum to be heavy so that the damping force of the magnets is not so great that the pendulum will not seek a true vertical null. Brush contacts rub on the resolver shaft to couple signals developed in the resolver to output terminals. These brush contacts inherently exert a frictional force on the resolver shaft. A very light brush force often results in noise and erroneous signals being generated, while a heavier force increases the turning resistance of the shaft requiring the pendulum to be even larger.In an attempt to avoid the use of brush contacts, hairsprings have been provided to conduct output signals from the for coils to output ermna1 s . These hairs or never without an elastic memory however, and this memory exerts a restoring force on the rotor shaft to give a null signal which is not true. A torqueless or brushless resolver can be built utilizing pure electromagnetic coupling between the rotor shaft and the resolver output leads, but the cost of such a device is too high to be a commercially satisfactory alternative. The present invention comprises a cant angle sensor which uses a small, lightweight, conductive, and nonmagnetic pendulum suspended from the shaft of a resolver. Stops are provided to limit the arc through which the pendulum may swing, and the pendulum itself is suspended so as to be partially contained within the slot of a C shaped magnet. As the cant or tilt of the sensor changes, the pendulum seeks a new null position which represents a true vertical, and motion of the pendulum within the slot of the C shaped magnet causes the magnet to exert a viscous hysteresis damping force causing the pendulum to come quickly to rest without oscillations about the new null.The hysteresis damping force is proportional to the velocity of the pendulum through the slot, resulting in a high force being exerted when the pendulum is first seeking a new null, with the force lessening as the null is approached. The signals which are developed by the rotor of the resolver are coupled directly to the resolver output terminals by the rotor magnet wire.This arrangement obviates the need for friction causing brushes on the rotor shaft or expensive magnetic coupling arrangements. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a cant angle sensor comprising a conductive nonmagnetic pendulum suspended from the shaft of a resolver in the slot of a C shaped magnet. It is another object of the invention to provide a cant angle sensor wherein a viscous hysteresis damping force is exerted on a conductive nonmagnetic pendulum by the slot of a C shaped magnet in which the pendulum is suspended, wherein the pendulum is coupled to the shaft of a resolver which output is connected directly to output terminals without the use of friction producing brushes. These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following specification taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a cant angle sensor according to the invention. Figure 2 is a partial sectional view of the resolver in the cant angle sensor of Figure 1. Turning now to the drawings, there is shown in Figure 1 a cant angle sensor generally designated by the reference numeral 10. The sensor comprises a frame 11, a top portion 12, and a housing 13. The top portion 12 may be used in attaching the sensor to a horizontal support surface 14. The frame 11 includes a front mounting plate 16 having a lower rectangular aperture 17 formed in the bottom portion thereof. A magnet 18 may be positioned in the aperture 17 and the magnet is mounted to the mounting plate 16 by a magnet mount 19. The magnet 18 may be of the Alnico type, is generally C shaped, and includes a slot 21 which comprises a flux path. A resolver 22 is located within the frame 11 and may be mounted to the back of the mounting plate 16 in a known way. A resolver shaft 23 may extend through the mounting plate 16 and a pendulum 24 is nonrotatably attached to the resolver shaft 23 with the lower portion of the pendulum 24 disposed within the slot 21.Two stops 25 are positioned on either side of the pendulum 24 and act to limit the arc through which the pendulum may swing. Copper may be preferably employed for the material of the pendulum, but other dense, nonmagnet ic and conductive materials such as aluminum, silver, or gold may also be used. Turning now to Figure 2, it will be seen thar within e resolver 22 an array of field coils 27 closely surround an array of rotor coils 28. The rotor coils 28 comprise a high number of turns of magnet wire which is disposed on the rotor form according to known techniques, and the ends 29 of the magnet wire from the rotor coils 28 are led through the rotor shaft 31 to output terminals 32. Lead wires 33 may be connected to the output terminals 32 so that signals developed by the rotor of the resolver may be coupled to a remote indicator not shown .It will be appreciated that because the stops 25 limit the swing of the pendulum 24 to an arc of 90 or less, the magnet wires 29, although they are attached directly to terminals 32, will not be twisted to the point of fracture by the rotation of the resolver shaft 31. The operation of the device will be obvious to those skilled in the art. When the support surface 14 to which the sensor 10 is attached is horizontal, gravity will cause the pendulum 24 to be suspended in a vertical null position centered on the mounting plate 16. As the support surface 14 is tipped to the left or right as viewed in Figure 1, the pendulum 24 will rotate relative to the mounting plate 16 to maintain a vertical null position. This will cause the rotor coils 28 of the resolver to rotate relative to the field coils 27 and to develop an electrical signal indicative of the new relative positions of the coils.This signal is coupled to the output terminals of the resolver by the magnet wires 29. As the pendulum which is conducting and nonmagnetic moves across the magnetic flux within the slot 21 of the magnet 18, a viscous hysteresis damping force is developed which is proportional to the speed of motion of the pendulum through the slot. When the velocity of the motion is great, the damping force is high, but as the pendulum approaches a new vertical null position, the decrease in the velocity of motion of the pendulum through the slot 21 causes a decrease in the damping force which is applied to the pendulum. In a steady state condition where the pendulum 24 is at a vertical null position, no force is exerted by the magnet 18. It will be appreciated that the direct connection of the magnet wire 29 to the output terminals 32 avoids the use of brushes which otherwise bear on the rotor shaft 31 and inherently restrict the freedom of motion of the pendulum 24. A cant angle sensor constructed in accordance with the present invention is able to be much smaller and lighter than heretofore possible because of the combination of the nonmagnetic material of the pendulum which is able to be viscously damped by a small permanent magnet and the frictionless brushless connection, having a substantially zero restoring force, between the rotor shaft and the resolver output terminals. Having thus described the invention, various modifications and alterations will occur to those skilled in the art, which modifications and alterations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.
