# CRYSTALLINE ZINCOSILICATE

## Abstract
This invention relates to novel porous zincosilicates hav ing a Theta 1 type structure and to a process for preparing the same. The zincosilicates can be loaded with catalytic compo nents e.g. gallium oxide and can be used with or without the catalytic components to catalyse a number of hydrocarbon conversion reactions, dehydration reactions and for the con version of synthesis gas to hydrocarbons.
