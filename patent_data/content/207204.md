# Polyolefins modified with sulphur trioxide trimethylamine.

## Abstract
A polyolefin that has been modified with sulphur trioxide trimethylamine complex is disclosed. The polyolefin may be homopolymer or copolymer of alpha olefins selected from the group consisting of alpha olefins having 2 10 carbon atoms, such alpha olefins being hydrocarbon. Preferred polymers are homopolymers of ethylene or propylene, or copolymers of ethylene and at least one C₃ C₁₀ alpha olefin. The modified polyolefin is preferably formed by admixing molten polyolefin with 20 2000 ppm of the complex at a tem perature of at least 210 C. The modified polyolefin is dyeable.
