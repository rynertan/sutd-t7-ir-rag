# Hoisting device with compensated tackle.

## Abstract
A hoisting device disposed on a freely movable support 1 and mainly comprising one or more hoisting cables S adapted to be wound on a winch drum 3 or the like con nected with said support 1 and leading to a freely hanging tackle 7 which carries the load 9 wherein the tackle 7 is suspended to at least one carrying cable 10 , 10 which is directly or indirectly at 15 fastened to the support 1 via a disc 11, 14 displaceable by a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder 8 controlled by a gas buffer, with respect to the support 1 , which thus not only compensates for the movement of the support, but also the gas pressure fluctuations in the gas buffer.
