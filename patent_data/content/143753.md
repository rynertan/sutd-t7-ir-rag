# Smoothing machine for wood panels.

## Abstract
A smoothing machine 1 for wood panels 6 , particu larly wood panels having contoured surfaces with parts in relief, includes a substantially horizontal conveyor belt 4 , a support structure 2 overlying the belt, and a plurality of smoothing units 9, 10, 11, 12 carried by the structure. Each smoothing unit 9, 10, 11, 12 comprises a support frame 13 and an abrasive roller 14 rotatably supported by the frame and driven by a motor 15 mounted on the frame, the rollers 14 facing the belt 4 and having coplanar horizontal axes of rotation 16 . In the machine 1 , each of the frames 13 is hinged about a vertical pivot axis 20 on a motor driven rotor 17 rotatably supported about a vertical axis of rotation 28 by the support structure 2 , and means 23, 24, 25, 26 are provided for releasably fixing the frames 13 to the rotor 17 . The machine enables multidirectional smoothing, whereby it is possible to smooth even very irregular panels.
