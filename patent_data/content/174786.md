# SOLID STATE POWER CONTROLLER WITH OVERLOAD PROTECTION

## Abstract
A power controller with overload protection having an alternating current source AC connected through power lines L1, L2 and a pair of power switching devices SW1, SW2 and a current sensor resistance shunt SH in series to a load LD . A line derived control power supply circuit LDS is connected through one of the power switching devices SW1 to the power line L1, L2 such that the control power supply current does not flow through the shunt SH or the load LD . Close and open commands are applied from a control switch CSW through a threshold detector DT and a logic circuit LG1 to operate a latch LCH that turns the power switching devices SW1, SW2 on and off under the clocking control of a zero voltage detector ZVD and a zero current detector ZCD and the gating control of a minimum current circuit MCC . An overload circuit AVC, ITC, TTC, LG2 provides instantaneous trip of the latch on rupture current or timed trip of the latch on smaller overloads. Opto isolated indicators SS, ST indicate trip conditions and loss of line voltage conditions as well as whether the load current is above or below a minimum current value which is a current level adequate for operation of the control system.
