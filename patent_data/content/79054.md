## Description
ENHANCER OF ANTI TUMOR EFFECTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the art This invention relates to a pharmaceutical for enhancing the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutics. Prior art In general, in the field of chemotherapy of tumors, multiple anti tumor agents have been combined to be used for the following purposes and effects 1 By using in combination a number of different agents selected from those of alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antibiotics and alkaroids, which show mutually no cross resistancy and are different in mechanism of action, the anti tumor effect can be enhanced additively or synergistically against tumors which are composed of a mixture of tumor cells different in sensitivity to various agents. 2 By using in combination anti tumor agents different in the way to attack tumor cells which are proliferating at random, various stages in the cell cycle of tumor cells can be widely attacked to ensure complete killing of tumor cells. 3 By using not only agents different in mechanism of action but also those having relatively similar mechanisms of action, a synergistic effect can be expected.For example, by using in combination a number of agents which are blocking a series of steps participating in DNA synthesis, a strong synergistic effect can be exhibited. 4 Each anti tumor agent has its specific side effect.Thus, by using in combination a number of agents with different side effects each in a dosage less than the limit above which side effects appear, the anti tumor effect can be expected to be increased additively or synergistically while the side effects are dispersed. By such a multi agent combination treatment, it has been made possible to obtain an effect which could not be produced by using a single anti tumor agent. However, each of the agents used in combination in such an application is an anti tumor agent which can be independently used. There have also been various attempts to use in combination with an anti tumor agent a compound which does not per se have an anti tumor effect for the purpose of strengthening the effect of the anti tumor agent by preventing the anti tumor agent from being inactivated in bodies.For example, it is known to use cytidine or uridine in combination with 1 8 D arabino furanosylcytos ine hereinafter referred to as ara C , as disclosed in JapaneseLaid Open Patent Application No.. 24150 1980. It is also known to use tetrahydrouridine, which is an inhibitor against cytidinedeaminase, in combination with ara C, as disclosed in Cancer Research Vol. 30, p.2166 2172, 1970.Further, there is known another method wherein 5 fluorouracil hereinafter referred to as 5 FU or a derivative thereof is combined with a pyrimidine compound such as, for example, uracil, cytosine, thymine, orotic acid, 5bromouracil, 5 iodouracil, l acetyluracil, 1 2 tetrahydro furyl uracil, 3 benzoyluracil, l cyclohexycarbamoyluracil, l n hexycarbamoyluracil, uridine, 2 deoxyuridine, 5 bromo2 deoxyuridine, cytidine, or 2 deoxycytidine. On the other hand, 9 B D arabinofuranosyl adenine hereinafter abbreviated as ara A has proved to exhibit cytostatic activity against cancer cells as a result of inhibiting DNA polymerase a, primarily through conversion to ara ATP in living bodies, or to exhibit antiviral activity by inhibiting, for example, HSV DNA polymerase. However, ara A is readily deaminated by adenosine deaminase existing widely in living bodies to be converted to less active 9 ss D arabinofuranosyl hypoxanthine, and their activities are not so remarkable. Particularly, with respect to antitumor activity, no remarkable cytostatic action against cancer cells can be recognized unless under the co presence with a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor such as 2 deoxycoformycin or coformycin, even in experiments on the cell level.Further, according to in vivo experimentation, ara A alone can exhibit only very weak activity against representative experimental tumors having potent adenosine deaminase activity. In fact, no attempt to apply clinically ara A alone as an antitumor agent has been successful, and no attempt has been practiced to use ara A in combination with other anti tumor agents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION I have made extensive studies on pharmaceuticals to enhance the anti tumor effect of a chemotherapeutic in therapy of malignant tumors with a chemotherapeutic and have consequently found that ara A has a marked effect of enhancing the antitumor effect of an antitumor agent. The present invention is based on this finding. The present invention thus concerns an enhancer of anti tumor effect comprising ara A as an active ingredient, which is to be used at the place for the treatment of malignant tumors with antitumor agents for enhancement of the antitumor effect thereof. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of enhancement of anti tumor effect which comprises administering ara A to a tumor bearing animal under the antitumor treatment with an antitumor agent. According to the present invention, the antitumor effect of an anti tumor agent is enhanced by ara A. Since ara A itself has almost no antitumor activity as mentioned above, such an activity of enhancing anti tumor effect of ara A has been entirely unexpected. Further, the chemotherapeutic comprising a combination of ara A and an anti tumor agent can be said to advantageously exhibit the synergistic effect of both agents.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Examples of antitumor agents whose antitumor effects can be enhanced by the pharmaceutical of the present invention are as follows. 1 Antimetabolites Examples of antimetabolites include methotrexate, 6mercaptopurine, 5 FU and its derivatives 5 fluorouridine, 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine, 1 ss D arabinofuranosyl 5 fluoro cytosine, l 2 tetrahydrofuryl 5 fluorouracil hereinafter referred to as FT 207 , 1 n hexylcarbamoyl 5 fluorouracil, l elhoxymethyl 5 fluorouracil, l ethoxycarbonyl 5 fluorouracil, 5 fluoro 5 deoxyuridine, etc. , and ara C and its derivatives cyclocytidine, N4 palitoyl ara C, N4 stearoyl ara C, N4 behenoyl ara C, ara C 5 stearyl phosphate, ara C oleyl phosphate, etc. . 2 Antitumor antibiotics Examples of antitumor autibiotics includes bleomycin hereinafter referred to as BLM , neocalcinostatin, anthracycline type antibiotics daunomycin, adriamycin, aclacynomycin, etc. . 3 Alkylating agents Examples of alkylating agents include nitrosourea such as ACNU, BCNU, CCNU, MCCNU, etc., 3 3 2 chloroethyl 3 nitrosoureido 3 deoxythymidine, and 3 3 methyl 3 nitrosoureido 3 deoxythymidine. ACNU stands for 1 4 amino 2 methylpyrimidin 5 yl methyl 3 2 chloroethyl 3 nitrosourea hydrochloride BCNU for I,3 bis 2 chloroethyl l nitrosourea CCNU for 1 2 chloroethyl 3 cyclohexyl l nitrosourea and MCCNU for l 2 chloroethyl 3 4 methylcyclohexyl l nitrosourea. It is not required to set specific conditions for the method of administration and the dosage of the antiturnor agent when used in combination with the pharmaceutical of the present invention, but optimum conditions for respective anti tumor agents may conveniently be employed. The pharmaceutical of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of malignant tumors wherein administration of antitumor agents and radiotherapy are used in combination. The pharmaceutical of the present invention may be administered to a patient under the anti tumor treatment with an antitumor agent, namely simultaneously with, before or after administration of an anti tumor agent. The pharmaceutical of the present invention may be administered according to conventional systemic or topical administration. As the unit dosage form for administration of the pharmaceuticals, various forms depending on the purpose of treatment and the method of administration may be chosen. For example, as the forms to be employed for the systemic administration method, preparations can be formed in tablets, capsules, granules or solutions for oral administration and in injections or suppositories for parenteral administration, while they can be formed in slow release capsules, ointments, injections or others for topical application. Such dosage unit forms can be prepared with the use of a carrier conventionally used in the field of pharmacology according to the preparation methods well known in the art.It is also possible to use various elaborations suitable for the object of the present invention. Further, as an embodiment of the invention, the anti tumor agent to be used in combination and ara A can be prepared as a formulation within the same dosage unit form. In this case, the pro portions of respective components to be formulated are determined according to the respective kinds employed. The pharmaceutical of the present invention is employed in a quantity effective for enhancement of the antitumor activity. More specifically, as determined from the basic effectiveness experiments, the daily dose of the present pharmaceutical, in general, is preferably 20 to 3,000 mg day for oral administration, 0.5 to 500 mg day for injection, and 20 to 2,000 mg for suppository. The optimum effective amount should be determined according to judgement by the attendant physician, depending on the type of the antitumor agent, its dosage, the condition of the disease and the afflicted portion. It is also possible to use the pharmaceutical of the present invention in combination with other enhancers of antitumor effect, either in an integrated dosage form or separate dosage forms. It may be considered that ara A enhances the antitumor effect by inhibiting repair of the damage of the tumor cells caused after exhibition of the pharmocological activity of an antitumor agent. The pharmacological effect of the pharmaceutical according to the present invention will now be demonstrated by way of test data. The pharmocological test method is as described below. C3H He strain male mice 8 weeks old were inoculated intradermally in the right thigh with 4 x 105 cells of syngeneic squamous cell carcinoma SOl. On the 13th or 14th day after inoculation of the tumor cells and thereafter, physiological saline solutions or suspensions of respective pharmaceuticals were administered intraperitoneally in respective dosages consecutively for respective days.After initiation of the treatment with the pharmaceuticals, the tumor sizes in the mice tested were measured in the three coordinate axial directions every day or every other day, and the results with respect to the following items were compared with those of the Control group.EMI6.1 tb SEP Max SEP Max.
