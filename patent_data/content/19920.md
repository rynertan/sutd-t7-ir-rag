# Digital data communication system.

## Abstract
In order to accomodate variations in data rate transmissions, a digital data communication system includes a data source 20 and a source interface 22 , a digital data bus 18 , for transferring encoded information from the data source to one or more receivers 26 , each having a receiver interface 24 . The source interface 22 is adaptable for controlling the rise and fall times of the signals on the bus at a plurality of frequencies. It is directly coupled to the bus 18 and terminates the bus in its characteristic impedance. The receiver interface 24 operates at a plurality of frequencies and is directly coupled to the bus 18 .
