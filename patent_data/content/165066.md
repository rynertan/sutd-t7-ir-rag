# FM signal demodulator.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an FM signal demodulator comprising a phase shifter including transversal filters 1, 2 for producing from a FM video signal two FM video signals which are different in phase by 90 DEG from each other, and a demodulator for detecting phase information of the FM video signal, wherein carrier frequency is at least quadrupled prior todemodulation so as to suppress components of the FM video signal not to be included in the demodulated video signal.
