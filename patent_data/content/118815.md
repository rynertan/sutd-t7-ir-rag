## Description
ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECUROPHOTOMEEER WITH ZEEDBACE The invention relates to a design of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and to a mode of its operation. The atomic absorption spectrophotometer is a device for spectral analysis and is used for quantitative determination of different elements, mainly kations, in solutions.The determination is executed by means of nebulization of an analysing sample into an atomizing cell, mainly flame, where the content. of the sample i.e. salts is converted in atomic vapor. Then the absorption. of light by this atomic vapor is measured0 The method is a comparative one, the concentation of the element in sample is calculated by comparation the atomic absorptions of the sample and a standard solution of known concentration.With a few exceptions the current atomic absorption spect.rophotometers consist of parts that can be related to three functional groups optical, electronic and atomizing, or successively a source of light the hollow cathode lamp or high friequency discharge lamp optical parts for directing and focusing of the light beam a monochromator a light receiver photomultiplier an electronic amplifier a display or recorder a nebulizer an atomizing cellThe design of atomic absorption spectrophotometers is perfected considerably year by year. Expecially the progress is noticeable in the electronic part from a linear amplifier to circuits that grounded on calculation of impulses and possess the ability to compare intensi vities of four beams.The microprocessor is often used to make easier operate. The Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Model 3030, produced by Bodenseewerk PerkinElmer CO Gybe, Postfach 1120, D 7770 Xberlingen, YRG 1 can be considered as a prototype for the present invention and an example of a modern spectrophotometer.But all of the instruments used currently for atomic absorption analysis, as well as the prototype, have an essential shortcoming accordingly to concept of the invention the absence of a feedback between the exit of the instrument and its entrance, or by other wording, between the result of analysis and the sample or procedure on this sample The connection between the sample and the result of its analysis i.e. the information in currently used instruments is only in the direction sample result. For instance, the any change in sample causes the change in the result, but not vise versa.The sample and information on this sample move in the instrument only in one direction. ,Tn addition to that the instrument makes measurement under tuning and calibration beforehand made by operator. By this consideration the instrument is an executor only.The purpose of the invention is the further perfection of the atomic absorption method of analysis by introdusing a feedback between the result of analysis of any sample and the procedure of analysis of this sample. It was possible only by introducing the principle of self tuning. This concept needs to be explain. The principle of feedback is well known in technology For instance the system for automatic level regulation of amplification in radio receiver, etc. But we have deal with the other kind of feedback, so named operational feedback. Let us analyse the analogy, the difference between manual steam engine and automatic steam engine by Watt. The manual steam engine was operated as following the information that the piston is at the end position was perceived by eyes of operator, was carried into the brain and in combining with the purpose of the task i.e. the back movement of piston the task was solved and the operating signal was produced. This signal comand was transmited into the hand of operator and the hand switched over the tap that operated on steam. The invention by Watt consists in substitution the operational feedback by mechanical feedback that operates in this engine more fast and precission. It is very impotant to point out that the operational feedback was existed already in the manual steam engine only why it operated , and a man through his brain ensured it.The operational feedback of such kind possess two persistend peculiarities. It operates with information and its feedback signal comand, decision or consequence is developed not immediately but with the impediment at least on the time of the information processing. Obviously the task or purpose must be exist in the information processing and at least a simple logic as laws of processing .The operational feedback exist more often in different systems To use such operational feedback in the atomic absorption spectrophotometer is offered by the present invention.It is the fact, so as it was in the case of Watt invention, that this operational feedback exists already in the system spectrophotometer operator, or spectrophotometer laboratory. Methodologically we transfer in an instrument a part of functions that are executed now by operator or techni cian by his brain and hands. In theWatt invention the operational feedback through brainhand was substituted by the feedback of other category mechanical, what is why the analysis for methods of brain function was not obliged for fulfilment that invention.Unfortunately we can not offer so simple solution for present invention. The feedback remains in the same category operational feedback and consequently the design will operate with information, logical conclusions, creation the operating signal, etc. Therefore for our case would be useful to consider first of all what manner the brain solves the analogical problems.There are the sound grounds now to reckon that a brain makes any control on behaviour in the very original manners On the basis of entering information, current task and the past experience the image corresponded to any consequence operation cin forts the patern of holographic waves 3 is primary created. During execution of the operation the secondary image is created on the basis of the current e cutiono The two images are compared constantly to control the execution and its derivation from plan first image In so manner a man reads, writes, executes any movement 2 X The creation the primary image beforehand the execution and constant comparation the current execution agaist the image is the innate peculiarity of the brain. Such patern has been developed in millions years and is an optimal one to conduct the behaviour of living beings.Really, the many elements the above pointed biological scheme are used in the instrument according the present invention. Taking into account some deviations that are coused by variability of design, in general the scheme of instrument operation will be as following 1. The image of the intermediate parameter its size in form of a number is primarily. introduced in the instrument element of memory . This image ans wers on the question what the size of this parameter must be and against it all followed measurements will be compared 2. The instrument makes a first test measurement on a sample. This test measurement is executed under definite but not optimal conditions for analysis this sample.3. The size of intermediate parameter from the test mea surement is analysed on satisfaction to definite con ditions if satisfy p. 4, if not satisfy p. 5.4. The instrument makes the analysis of the sample and result of the analysis is displayed.5. The intermediate parameter that has been got in the test mesurement is compared with the size of parameter primarily. . introduced.6. On the basis absolute sizes and difference of inter mediate parameters and the intention to get optimal conditions the operating feedback signal OPS is calculated and produced The OFS makes a retuning in characteristic part of the design according the invention.8. The instrument makes a next test measurement, then as in p. 3 and all following. DESIGN OF TBE INBTRRRR T The design of the instrument according to the invention consists from 1. Elements used in the current atomic absorption spectrophotometers 1.1 A source of light.1.2 Optical parts for directing and focusing of the light beam.1.3 A monochromator.1.4 A light receiver photomultiplier.1.5 An electronic amplifier.1.6 A display.1.7 A nebulizer.1.8 An atomizing cell.2. Elements characterizing the present invention 2.1 A microprocessor.2.2 Two pumps for feeding of solutions and connected successively.2.3 Two electromotors connected with pumps and operated separate.2.4 A mixer connected between the pumps.DESCRIPTION TEE ELEMENTS CHARACTERIZING THE INVENTION 2.1 A microprocessor It is taken in the characterising part of the invention due its new functions. The microprocessor must possess to execute the following 2.1.1 to accept in a memory the size of the primary parameter the number charactesizing the absorption in the units of extinction or a function from it .2.1.2 to execute comparation of numbers.2.1.3 to produce calculation of operating feedback signals by equations or formulae, transform it in friequency or voltage.2.1.4 to produce a succession of comands as a function of time, including an impediment.2.1.5 to execute calculations by formulae EMI7.1 where A the absorption or the signal at the exit of the electronic amplifier, C the concentration of the element in analysed solution, i the friequncy corresponding to the operating feedback signal, K the constant that corresponded to every current calibration, st the index standard that relates to proce dure with solution of known concentration.2.1.6 to set the start friequency or operating feedback signal by choice.The variants of disign are possible that can modify these functions.2.2 Two pumps for feeding of solutions.The pumps can be the same or different in construction.But operate conditions for them are different. The pump 6, Fig. 1, feeds solution with constant speed, the pump 3, Fig. 1, feeds solution with variable speed that is changed even during analysis of one sample. The pumps can be different in construction including the peristaltic one in which, a liquid is moved inside a soft tube that is compressed outside by moving rollers. But the peristaltic pumps possess two shortcomings important for the invention the pulsation of stream and unsatisfactories in proportionality between the speed of feeding and speed of rotation. These shortcomings can be improved partially, the first one by gradual deviation of the press road from the rollers at the exit side, the second shortcomingto prop a pressure of liquid at the entrance side of pump.But under conditions as pointed at Figo 1 the difference of pressure at the entrance and exit of pumas is little, some ten centimeters of water column. The pumps operate in mode of dispencer. The pump 6, Fig. 1, operates even in the flow produced by nebulizer 9.When a little gradient the satisfactory result was obtained with the construction of pump pointed at Figure 2. Where 1 and 5 are elements of the corpus and were made of textolyte. 2 and 4 teflone films. The laying 3 was made of teflone. The gears 6 and 7 were made of hard teflone. The tubes 8 metallic. The pump is screwed by four screws up to hard rotation of the shaft 7 by a hand.The pump ensures the satisfactory proportional dependence between speed of feeding and speed of rotation at the range maX Vmin above 100 when a gradient in pressure is small. Y means a volume speed of a liquid.Every pump is connected to a synchronous step motor.The step motor operates by electric impulses and every impulse rotates the rotor of the motor at a certain angle.2.3 Mixer.The construction of mixer is shown at Fig. 3. The mixer is connected in the position 5, Fig. 1. The mixer was made of plexiglass, capillars were metallic. 71n the mixer the flow of analysed solution or standard is mixered with the flow of solvent. The mixer was introduced in the instrument not with the intention to mix, the flows, those will be well mixed in the following pump 6 and nebulizer 9 Fig. 1, but to uniform feeding when analysed solution is introdused in slowly speed. At this consideration the capillary through that the analysed solution is introduced in the. mixer was made in diminished inner diameter. OPERATION OF ELEMENTS CXARACUERISING THE INVENTIONThe pump 3 sucks an analyzed solution or a solution known concentration through the capillary 2, Fig. 1. The solution entrances then into the mixer 5. The synchronous step motor 4 is connected with the pump 3 and rotates it with different speeds proportional to friequency of impulses. The electric impulses are produced by a generator 11 and supplied by wires 13.The friequency of impulses is determined by the microprocessor 10.The pump 6, Fig, 1, is connected with the sgnchronous step motor 7 The motor 7 rotates with constant speed.This speed is determined by the friequency of impulses coming from generator 11 by wires 12. The pump 6 feeds solutions by constant speed and this speed is always greater as the maximal speed approached by pump 3. For compensation the variable difference a pure solvent is feeded through the capillary 14 For some methods it is possible to supply the special solutions by this capillary, so as La N03 3 or kN03, that will get additional advantages. The flows through capillaries 1 and 2 in summary are equal to the flow through capillary 8. It is, obviously that if the pumps 3 and 6 are equal in productivity the friequency of impulses supplied to motor 7 must be greater as maximal friequency to motor 4. If to determine those friequency to be equal than the productivity of pump 7 must be greater as the productivity of pump 3, Fig. 1.The construction pointed at Fig. 1 gives the possibility to change the concentration of solution entering into the nebulizer by means of changing the friequency of impulses feeding the motor 4, while the concentration of analysed sample remaines the same. The change of concentration in the solution entering into the nebulizer does not destroy the calibration of the instrument if the speed of feeding into a nebulizer remains the same, he second characteristic of the construction is also important the concentration of the element entering in a nebulizer is proportional to its concentration in a sample and is proportional to the speed of feeding of this sample. This characteristic is very important for all further conclutions and must be proved.The chart for flows of solutions is represented at theFig. 4. The marks at figure mean V a volume speed for solvent,Vs a volume speed for analysed sample,Vn a volume speed for the solution entering into nebu lizer,Cs concentration of element in analysed sample, Cn concentration of that element in the solution entering into nebulizer.For one calibration Vn const.For one sample Cs const.The condition of constant volume for the construction as at Big. 1 Vn V VsThe condition of constant transported mass of analysed element Cn.Vn Cs.Vs Therefore, as Vn const, On K.Cs.Vs. 1 as Os const, On S Vs 2 From the construction conditionsVs This, therefore On E s 3 , where K constant in common form, is the friequency of impulses to motor 4, Fig. 1.The dependences by formulae 3 allow to design an instrument with feedback and introduce the third parameter i.e. the OFS in the practice of the atomic absorption method of analysis. Really, the connections between On and absorption A for instance in units of extinction can be established by any AA spectrophotometer, the connections between A and is is established and calculated by microprocessor through calculation operating feedback signal, and connections between Vs and Cn is established by construction at Fig. 1 through formula 3 Constant X is excluded due the procedure of calibration.The closed information circle exists during measurement EMI11.1 tb SEP spectrophotometer SEP A tb SEP a tb SEP e SEP a SEP tb design SEP e SEP c SEP b SEP SEP culculation tb Fig. SEP 1 SEP of SEP OFS tb SEP Ss tb SEP feedback tb All operations and design according to arrows lob and c relate to characterising part of the invention. I he information during execution of analysis for every sample moves in direction pointed by arrows. The optimal conditions for atomic absorption analysis of any sample can be easy formulated by a set of logic rules. These logic rules are used by microprocessor in calculation of OFS as a purpose of the tuning. During execution of analysis for every sample the information moves by the circle, simultaneously the tuning of the chains is produced with the purpose to get the optimal conditions for determination just analysed sample.When these conditions are achieved the two tactics are possible 1. The data of the last tuning are sufficient for calculation the concentration Cs, and the result of analysis Cs in calculated as a by product of the data form the last tuning 2. The separate measurement with sample is executed to get the data necessary for calculation Cs. This tactics is better because the test measurements for calculations of OFS don t demand so high accuracy as the measurement for culculation of Os. The calculation of OFS by microprocessor is produced in a little part of second, the test measurement can be executed in very short. time the time of measurement and the precission are inversely proportional for atomic absorption determination .Therefore the tactics by p. 2 is more time economicOf course such uncertains as Cn variable value during determination even one sample , constants K in formulae 1 3 and V n are excepted from calculations OFS or Cs and do not appeared in the corresponding formulae due to a stage of calibration. VARIANTS OF DESIGNThe schema Fig. 1 can be modified possible inunenumerate variants. It is necessary to point out only some of them to find the common principles and to make the correct definition in the claims.Variant 1. According to Fig. 1.Variant 2. The pump 6, motor 7 and wares 12 are removed, other elements as at Fig. 1.The pneumatic nebulizer 9, Fig. 1, is a pneumatic pump and it can be regulated on productivity higher as maximal productivity of pump 3 In the schema,Fig. 1, pump 6 and motor 7 are used to improve the characteristics of nebulizer. As it was shown early 3 the pneumatic nebulizers work unstable in time and responce for the main part of the calibration drift. The both schemata also improve the nebulizer characteristics.Variant 3. The schema pointed at Fig. 5 possess all functions as at Fig. 1, but its constructed by other elements 1. a microprocessor.2. a generator impulses.3. wires.4. a sinchronic step electromotor.5. a gear.6. a piston in a cylinder.7. a three way tap.8. a capillary for feeding sample or standard solutions.9. a capillary for feeding a solvent.10. a peristaltic pump.11. a nebulizer.The piston dispencer can produce a feeding with the proportional correlation a feeding from speed of rotation in the range Vmax Vmin about 1000. That is the advantage comparing with the schema as at Fig. 1. But the variant requires the special step in operating for washing of cylinder and piston. The pump as it shown at Fig. 2 all owes to save the current usual mode of operation becouse the washing is executed by a first portion of the analysed sample.Variant 4. The connections of the pumps as it is shown at Fig. 6 allow to save the through current style of the washing step and broad considerable the range of proportionality. For seccessive connection of pumps the broadening is Vmax Vmin n , where the value in brackets relates to one step from two pumps and n the quantity of the seccessive steps. Variant 5. All above considered variants have a rigit demand to the proportionality between is and Vs. It is caused by combining two functions in one phenomenon.The friequency provides feeding of solutions and supplied information on the speed of feeding. If these functions to devide the demand to nzortionality will be rejected.The variant with the devided functions is shown atFig. 7, where 1. a capillary for feeding a solvent.2. a capillary for feeding sample and standard solutions.3. a thermal diod.4. a thermal diod.5. a pump.6. a mixer.7. a sinchronic step motor.8. wires to conduct operate signals.9. wires to conduct impulses from diod 4.10. wires to conduct impulses to diod 3o 11. a generator and reciever impulses.12. wires to computer.The method with the thermal diodes all owes to measure the speed of liquides inside a capillary by measurement the speed of transference of thermal impulses E41 Other variants also can be used, including other pumps and methods for measurement the speed of feeding.However the common principle is shown at Fig. 4. The speed of feeding of analysed solutions is changed during analysis of samples and one sample, but every changes in the feeding of analysed solution are compensated by feeding the solvent to get constant speed the mixed solution that entrancing into a nebulizer. CALCULATION OF OPERATING FEEDBACK SIGNALThis procedure can be executed in different ways, named variants. We may consider only some of them to definite correct the invention. The location this part before the part of the description considering the algorithms of operation relieves the conception of invention.Let us consider at first the simple example. We set beforehand one of the consequence for operation that must not be the optimal, but is well for explanation.Take the standard solution 50 mg D Cu. Set the friequency Vs O in the instrument according schema as Fig. 1 and connected with a spectrophotometer. Adjust zero.Then set friequency Vs 1 10Vs max, makeadjust the instrument on standard 5 mg L . Then set friequency Js 4 10 ds max, make measurement of concenration by insrument not correct result set friequency Vs 7 10 Vsmax, make measurement of concentration, and at last set fis Vs msur, and make measurement of concentration.The curve that has been got in such experiment is represented at Fig. 8, where E means the extinction corresponded to mode of operation A absorption for current spectrophotometerj X x E extinction affected by variable amplification, corresponded to C mode of operation, concentration .The curve consists of two parts 0 5 mg Ir Cu the part of proportional relations. The data desplayed by instrument is proportional to concentration of element in the sample. 5 50 mg L the part not proportional relations.In the proportional part concentration G is determined by KxE through the simple equation C C t Ost 4 KxE st there relation Cst KxE st is determined in the step of calibration with standard solution known concentration Cst. For simplisity we will mean as A data displayed by instrument, therefore C Cst . A 5 AstIn nonproportional part the relations are complex.The dependence A from C in the range 5 50 mg L Cu approaches to parabola in the formA K.C2 L.C M 6 where X, L, M eoefficients, and K is negative.To compare different methods of calculations in the nonproportional range the experiment corresponded toFig. 8 was prolonged. The friequencies is 10 50 Vs max, Vs 27 50 Vs max and Vs 42 50 Vs max were set and measurements of concentrations were made.These data correspond to the places in middle between the points of the first calibration, and that correspond to the case would we feed into the mixer standards 10, 27, 42 mg L Cu. The concetrations for these points were calculated also by means of data A for these points and coordinates the points of the first calibration.The sizes of deviations are represented in Table 1.The quantity of the standards are more as it is necee.ssary to solve the some of the equation, at this case the nearest coordinates were taken.The deviations pointed in Table 1 are maximal for each part of the curve at Fig. 8. At other places of the curve they will be smaller and at the points 5, 20, 35 and 50 mg L Cu will be equal 0. Of course, the size of deviation would be considerable diminished by increasing the number Table 1. Deviation in calculations for nonproportional part.

The signal by the instrument is A ExE 0.5. At this case the real concentration in the analysed solution Cs 0.5. Vmax Vs 5 mg L. The frieqiency for follo wing analytical determination of this sample can be set at once V max. All calculations of concentration in the following determination can be made by formula 5 with data of calibration with standard 5 mg L.Mark the standard corresponded to the upper verge of the proportional part as Cv and corresponded signal by instru ment Av.2. The signal by instrument is A 0.5. At this case the concentration in the analysed solution Cs 5 mg L, O.5x Vmax Vs . The friequency for following analy tical determination i.e. for calculation of result can be set Vmax. 3. The signal by instrument is in the range 0.5 A 5. At this case the concentration in analysed solution will be 5 Cs 50. But in the range 0.5A45 the instrument operates with the proportional part and by formula 5 the value C corresponded to signal A can be calculate. Then multiplying this value by relation Vmax Vs 10 we can calculate the concentra tion Cs in analysed solution, for calculation OFS. The operating feedback signal is calculated asfriequ ency that must be supplyed to motor 4, Fig. 1, to make the instrument signal for analysed sample equal to Av. This friequency is calculated simple CvVmax CsV OFS const EMI20.1 This formula is a consequence of inversely proportional relations in the line corresponding the functionA const and being in a calibration surface, that will be considered.The friequency VOFS inset to the motor 4, Fig.1, the measurement of A corresponding to this friequency is executed and the result. is calculated by formula 28 4. The signal by instrument is in the range 5 A A 30, see Fig. 8. At this case the concentration in the solution will be in the range 50 Cs 500. Using of one of the methods for calculation of concentration in the region of nonproportional relations, for instance the any method in Table 1, it is possible to calculate approximately the value Os. With this value by formula 7 the OPS is calculated with the accuracy of Cs. It will not affect on the calculation of the result of analysis Cs , so as the last will be calculated from following exact determination of the para A andThe best to set the region for installation VoFS asAv Av A Av, where Av 0.3Av 8 If A is situated in the range the proportional relations near Av, the size of A for test step is not critical.5. The signal by instrument is A 30, see Fig. 8.At this case the concentration in analysed solutionOs 500. This is a case of indefiniteness. At this case the microprocessor can make signal to diminish the friequency for instance at 100 times and repeat the test. If in this second test the signal by instrument is in the range 0.5 A 50 that will be correspond to concentration in analysed solution 500 Cs 50000 mg D and the OFS can be calculated in one step to approach for A the region 8 .The method of calculation OFS can be modified further in many ways. For instance, to set other number of standard points, to make calibration in range 0 100 mg L, or O 5 mg Ir only, to begin the first test with i 00 max, etc.Let us to set the main principles for OFS calculation. 1. By refering the current signal of instrument in the test operation to calibrated range of this signal we can get the set of cases. For every case the particular reaction of instrument and particular method determination of OFS must be programmired.2. The reaction of instrument and its circuits can be set by simple logic rules inequations and formulae.3. It is useful to distinguish two processes the test determination of Cs through A for OFS calculation and the analytical determination the concentration Cs in a sample. The demands to accuracy of the first can be considerable diminished.4. According to p. 3 the stage of calibration can be considered consists of two parts the precision calibration for analytical determination here 0 and 5 mg L and accelerated calibration for calculation OFS. For the last calibration the data of the first part are used also. If calibration will be made by two points only 0 and Cv the last part is absent. 5. Methodologically, the method calculation by refering the signal only to the range of proportional relations 0 5 mg L is a particular case of the method proportional interpolation with more points, and the last is a particular case of approximation by equation of curve.6. All methods for calculation Os represented in Table 1 satisfy the demands in accuracy for calculation OFS.7. Other methods to make reinstallation also can be realized including monotonous insta3jation and using separate circuits for calibration and calculation OFS and Os in electronic amplifier.8. Due to the range of proportional relations in scalesE 5 and w R the both scales can be used for fulfilment. At Fig. 9 the correlation the two scales is shown, for spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer, model 432. The parts proportionality 0 5 mg D are combined completely by vertical scale selection. At the region higher concentration the patern of curves is different. But take into account the principles 3 and 4 the problem of the precision approximation that exists for the current spectrophotometers for calibration by several standards is canceled for the present invention. DISTINCTION THREE PARAMETER METHOD AND CURRENT AASPECTROSCOPY AND PROPERTIES OF CALIBRATION SURFACE The principal distinction current spectrophotometer and a spectrophotometer with feedback accordingly the present invention consists that the first operates with two variable parameters A and C, but the second operates with three A, C and i, where A 11absorption11, in general the signal by amplifier,C concentration in analysed solution, friequency of impulses, hier proportional to speed of feeding.1. For current atomic absorption spectrophotometer the dependence A and C can be represented by calibration curves, as it is shown at Fig. 10. One curve relates to one calibration. Every curve while absortion is represented in units of extinction or proportional to it i.e. the logarithmic amplifier is consists of two parts. The part of the proportional dependence A and C is shown at Fig. 10 as unbroken line. The part of nonproportional dependence A and C is shown the dotted line.The dependence in the proportional part is expressed by formulaA K.C 9 and the coefficient K is determined by calibration of the instrument with standard solution to get working formula 5 . The dependence in the nonproportional part is approximately described by formula 6 . This region rarely usedç 2. For the three parameter method the dependence A fromC is converted in dependence A from the product C x Really, for solution entering in nebulizer the concentration is Cn and formula 9 can be rewritten in the form A K.Cn 10 tating On from the formula 1 A K.Cs.Vs where Vs speed of feeding, and Vs K.Vs, therefore A K.Cs.Vs 11 where index s relates directly to analysing solution, sample.At formula 11 there are three variable parameters.The dependence of three variable parameters is expressed geometrically as a surface0 When for the current atomic absorption spectroscopy the calibration graph is expessed by a line at a plane, see Fig. 10, then for the three parameter method the calibration graph is expressed by a surface in a space The lines at this space will be got as sections of this surface by the planes that express the constant value for one of those parameters, i.e. the functions A const, C const, i const.Accordingly, if take i const, for instance i V max, at the crossing the calibration surface with the plane V i max the curve will be got typical for current A spectroscopy correspondent to constant feeding Vmax.For every other value of V the new curve will be got correspondent to new calibration of instrument on new instaLation of value of feeding. Therefore,the current two parameter AA spectroscopy is a particular case of the three parameter AA spectroscopy, when third parameter is fixed in constant value constant i, constant feeding .At Fig. 11 the calibration surface is represented in coordinates A, C, V and the sections with all planes are pointed. The sistematic explanation of method for building this surface is omitted here, but necessary characteristics to construct modes of operation algorithms and formulae will be consided.The surface is restricted by four lines OC, CED, DBV and JO, Fig. 11. The line CED corresponds to the maximal value of parameter 0. The line DBS corresponds to the maximal value of parameter i that is possible by condition of operation i i max . The lines OC and OV are on the axis. The lines OC, O and parts of lines CE and VB are stralght. The parts BD and ED are curves.The line CED means the function A f , when C Cmax const, where f a function in a general form. The lineVBD means the function A fC, when V Vmax const. This would be a particular case of current two parameterAA specrtoscopy when feeding is constant correspondigtto max. The line VBD would be a typical calibration line, as at Fig. 10,but in the plane VBD at the height OV .The line OV at the axis V means the function A when C O. The line OC at the axis C is the functionA fC, when V OThe shaded figures, fourangles, are in the planes that are parallel to the plane Voo. The top concave sides of the fourangles are situated in the calibration surface.These lines are a set of functions C fV, when A const.These are the functions of inverse proportionality const A Ke Out of the calibration surface these lines would approach assimptomatically to the planesVOA and AOC.The calibration surface OCDEBV, Fig. 11, in form is a concave surface that has a slope from the line VBD to the line OC and also outside from the line VBD to line CED. further let us take into consideration only those characteristics of function 11 and the calibration surface that will relate to the deduction of the opera tional modes for instrument.1. The function j1 is monotonous. The every paar values of the two parameters corresponds only to one value of the third parameter The one value of any one parameter corresponds to the set a . of paar values of the other two parameters. Consequently from that, for instance, to calculate C we need to know only one paar A and V. By modification of 11 A1 A2 AnC ....... 12 K . V1 K . V2 K . VnThis wonderful property of the function 12 in spare degree of freedom ensure the possibilities to make any reinstallations in procedure analysis of any one sample.Moreover, using not complex logic rules to make reinsta llation into the optimal condition for analysis any current sample.2. For every current installation of the instrument , such ingredients of this installation as flows of gases through a burner air and acetylene, for instance, flow of liquid through a nebulizer, pressure of gases, presure of air to a nebulizer, position of a burner, current to a lamp, adjustment amplifier, etc, correspond to one calibration surface, They can not be changed without alteration the calibration.3. The changes in values Vs, is, C8 do not alterate the calibration. 4. If to broad the limits of paramters Cs Cmax, is imax, A Amax, this would not alterate the calibration but would lead to the expantion of the surface area by shifting lines CED or iBD, Fig. 11.5. The coefficient K for every point of the calibration surface can be present as a product of three coordinates relating to this point, from the equation 11 it is followed A OA1K Cs. Vs OC1.OV1 13 If OA1 let to be constanta , that relates to the lines at the surface where absorption is constant, at Fig. 11 to the upper sides of the fourangles, then OC1.OV1 OC2.OV2 ..... OCn.OVn 14 Consequently, thecoefficient K is constant for every line at the calibration surface, if this line is a line A const.6. The section BEE B where A Av constant , Fig.11, has the particular characteristics it devides the calibration surface at two parts O BEC the field of proportional relationsBDE the field of nonproportional relations. This distinction is analogous to the distinction of curves in the two parameter kA spectroscopy, and relates to the property of the coefficient K in the equation 11 . At the first field K const, when A changes.At the second field K const, when A const, andK is changed when A chandes.The curvature the dependence K from A in the field of nonproportional relations is caused by a quanto opti cal phenomenon in the atomizing cell. And as rule, for every element the individual verge size Av is exist and can be established for every model of instrument. METHODS FOR EXECUTION OF ANALYSIS BY THREE PARAMETER li SPECTROSCOPY The atomic absorption method of analysis with feedback according the present invention possesses the degree of freedom in relations between parameters and must have many variants for procedure of execution the analysis.Let us consider part of them but in the systematic succession the variants related to the proportional part of relations , the variants that relate to the nonproportional part of relations and the variants that related to both parts. Our purpose will be to find the optimal variant and to help in the claim 5 definition. Method 1. Take two points 1 and 2 at the calibration surface in the part of the proportinal relations, seeFig. 12. For every points according to the equation 11 A1 K.C1.V1 and A2 K.C.V2 15 where A1, C1, A2, C2 are the coordinates of points 1 and 2. By exepting the coefficient K from the equal tions 15 the equation can be got EMI28.1 Therefore the concentration C2 can be calculated if it is an unknown concentration making the measurement of absorption A2 for this solution and registering the friequency i2 with which the A2 was got. The relation in the brackets must be estimated by separate procedure with the solution 1 with known concentration C1.This procedure is named calibration, when the A1 and are estimated and Cl is known.The obviously limitations for this procedure by Method 1 are the following 0 A1 Av and 0 A2 Av Method 2. It is known from the theory of measurements that any quantity is measured with smaller relative mistake as the absolute quantity is large, while the method of measurement remains the same. Also the absorption would be measured with more accuracy when A Av, i.e. the maximal volue for method 1. Therefore, the second method must be EMI29.1 when A1 Av and 0 A2 Av 17 The condition A1 Av according to desigh of the present invention can be obtain by selection Ci, when V1 const or by adjusting V1 when C1 is set. The condition for that C1 Cv. Method 3. It is possible also to adjust 32 according.. the conditions If C2 Cv, than A2 Av and ifC2 Cv than V2 Vmax. see Fig. 11. In other wording it is the condition to get i2 or. A2 so maximal as it possible to get in the field of proportionality of the calibration surface.The formula of method 3 is EMI29.2 with the conditions if C2 Cv adjust i2 by condition i2 Vmax, 18 if C2 Cv adjust A2 by condition A2 Av. 19 At the case 19 the adjustion of A2 can be executed only by adjusting of V2. One of the methods for OFS calculation must be used for calculation that i2 that corresponds the condition A2 Av. Method 4. The calculation with the reference to the intermediate friequencye It is possible to produce calculation C2 result of analysis in two steps. First in the profileC2 const, then in the profile Al const, see Fig. 12. In first profile calculate the friequency i3 , that must supply the solution C2 to get the value of absorptionA1,that point 1 has . From the similarity of the triangules at the profile C2, Fig. 12 EMI30.1 Then execute the second step of calculation, in the shaded profile already, Fig. 12. The condition of the line in this profile is A K.C.V when A const.From here C1.V1 C2.V3 A1 E const1 and EMI30.2 or in combining with 20 EMI30.3 This two step method of calculation is drived to the method X and formula 16 if it would be executed in one step.There are the more methods of calculation in the proportional part but they will be in the scope of formula 16 . liet us consider in short the nonproportional part.Method 5. The calculation with reference to the calibration section.For getting the calibration section , as it is shown atFig. 13 Cst, D,B , the solution of known concetrationCst is supplied through capillary 2, Fig. 1. Friequen cy V O is set and zero is adjusted. Further the friequency is increased step by step. For every friequency the signal A is measured. The set of paars V and A will be the curve Cst B, at Fig. 13. This curve is function A fV when Cst const. The dependence A fV can be represented, for instance, by the polynomialA B.V2 C.V D where B, 0 and D are coefficients or by other approximation.Then solution unknown concentration C1 is feeded by some casual friequency i1 , see Fig. 13, and the value Al is measured. By polynomial the instrument calculates the friequency Vst in the calibration profile Cst B that would correspond to the value A1. While in the profile Al const, Fig. 13,the inversely proportional dependence exist C1.1 Cst.Vst, and from here EMI31.1 Therefore, the method 5 includes the calculations in the calibration section to establish Vst and additional calculation by formula 23 .Method 6. The calculation with reference to the point of standard.At the Figure 14 the crossing of four sections are shown. The parallel crossings are the friequencies. The following correlations exsist between four friequencies at the places of crossing A1 K1.Cst.V2 K1.C1.V1 Cst.V2 C1.V1 or or Ast K2.Cst.V3 K2.C1.V4 Cst.V3 C1.V4 EMI32.1 Here, Fig. 14, the values A1 and Ast are measured by instrument A1 with friequency V1 V1 can be arbitrary , Ast with friequency during calibration. i2 is calculated as it was in method 5, i.e. with data of calibration A, for profile Cst. Then the valueV4 can be calculated by formula 24 . After that the concentration C1 can be calculated directly in the profile Ast, Fig. 14, by formula EMI32.2 3y combining 24 and 25 it would be got inversely.the method 5, and the calculation C1 in profile h . Method 7. All calculations are executed as in method 6.But the profile Ast is taken at the verge position where the absorption is Av. That gives the unification with methods 2 and 3 were calculations also were related to the profile Av. The difference consists in approching to the profile from other side.Method 8. Calculations of concentration in methods 1 7 are based on the measurements of A with casual in principle friequency i while we have no information on a sample before the test . This condition can be far from the optimal for determination of the sample,that leads to inaccuracy.In principle the best tactics of analyst consists that the procedure of analysis is devided. The all methods 1 7 must be used for test analysis and for getting the first value of Cs. This value will be used for calculation ORES. With the new friequency setted by OFS the second analytical determination is executed for calculation of the result of analysis Therefore the tactics 1 7 can be modified by repeating the measurement with new calculated friequency.Method 9. To get precision Av by retuning the friequency is difficult, especially from the far range. But the difficulty is get over if as a criterion of installation would be set a zona in a range, for instance, from Av to A, where A is lower Av in 20 50 . The number of An in formulae for calculation OFS can be taken into that range . At Fig. 15 the range selected in such manner is shown as a shaded fourangle. That is a projection from a calibration surface at plane AOC. The axis i at this projection is transformed in the point 0. The value Av for this case is 0.32E Cu . For this zone the value for calculations OFS is selected as An in the middle of the zone 0.272E . All range will be expressed asAn i dA. Therefore the method 9 consists of the method 8, but the size Av is taken as a range Ant dA. The criterion of being into the zone. is An AA C A An AA 26 Method 10. Above described methods use the numeral method for calculation friequency. But the adjustment of the friequency in the condition 26 can be executed by servo instalation procedure. Instrument can continuously measure A and compare it with An. In depending of size and sign of the difference the friequency is continuously changed better with variable speed. When condition 26 is reached the analytical measurement with constant i is executed. Method 11. The values Av were taken as a reference data for every element and introduced in the program of instrument. Corresponding Cv were established by separate testa and then introduced in the program as a reference. However, design and principles developed in the invention are sufficient to flake instrument that determines the parameters An, AA correspondent to every calibration.1 . At this case the instrument will be a self training.Method 12. Finally, let us consider the other extreme.Most easy to construct the instrument that will operate accordingly the present invention, when an operator, looking for displa ing absorption by instrument, turns a knob that operate on speed of rotation of the Sump, for instance, by motor 4 at Fig. 1. After adjusting the absorption in condition 26 the operator takes out the data value of A and speed of rotation. Then the operator calculates the result with any calculator by the formula, analogical to 16 A Cst.VstC V Ast 27 Where V the speed of rotation in any scale or any other function that is proportional the speed of feeding by pump 3, Fig. 1.This schema also will be a spectrophotometer with feedback, but the feedback that is executed through a brain and a hand of the operator it is why only the instrument operate. The variant by method 12 is very attractive by its simplicity. But it needs to remark, that theHumanity begins decline from the feedback executing through the living beings at the,begin of the Gechnologi cal Revolution already, as it happens once with the steam machine operated by manual.

The concentration Ost is taken in the range from On to Cmax, where the concentration Cn is determined as the solution that gives An when i max.The practice had shown that for initial friequency preferable to take 1 10 1 15 Vmax. With this friequency the test measurement with standard solution is executed.The instrument retuning the friequency for satisfacting 26 and than makes analytical determination with standard solution. The expression Cst.Vst Ast in form of a number is remain in memory.2. Measurement of sample.The solution of unknown concentration C is feeded by the capillary 2, Fig. 1. The first measurement of absorption is produced with the friequency 1 10 Vmax. The value 6f A is analysed against An by categories a satisfaction to inequation An A A An A 26 b the difference A An, c the sign of the difference A An.If A satisfies to the inequation 26 than the measurement is repeated with the same friequency but with more long time of measurement. Then concentration is calculated by formula A Cst.Vst O 28 V AstIf the test measurement do not satisfy the inequation 26 than the OFS is culculated and transmitted to motor 4, Fig. 1. The second test measurement is executed and analysed on the inequation.If the second test satisfy the condition 26 the analytical determination begin and result of the analysis is calculated by formula 28 , ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTIONThe advantages of the three parameter method of analy sis according to the invention and compared to the current atomic absorption method and to the prototype 13 are following 1.
