# Collapsible stroller.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a collapsible wheelchair or carriage of the stroller type, particularly for handicapped children. The carriage has a rectangular, rigid under frame, formed by two side members 1 with wheeled axes 2 joining said members, which also support a superstructure 5, 7, 9 . The superstructure is collapsible from an erected position of use to a folded position adjacent the underframe, and carries the carriage seat 15 , which includes a seat portion 15a and a back portion 15b and preferably side pieces as well. The superstructure is self locking in an erected state, such that it cannot be collapsed under the action of the weight of a person sitting in the seat. The superstructure is also implemented to form armrests or side supports for the seat.

## Description
Collapsible stroller ne present invention relates to a collapsible wheeled chair or carriage, particularly for children and of the socallec strcller type. The carriage in accordance with the inventIon has been developed primarily for handicapped children but can naturally also be used for those without handicap, the construction of the carriage being also utilizable in principle for adult wheelchairs. A basic problem in the implementation of collapsible stroller type carriages is to provide a sufficiently stable construction, which should also be self locking in its erected state, so that the carriage is not unintentionally collapsed by the action of the weight of the person sitting in the carriage, if some locking or latching member should be out o function. Such unintentional collapsing of the carriage can lead to very serious injuries to the person using it. The construction should als be such that it is smile and cheep to manufacture. The type of structures used so far for collapsible strollers or wheelchairs seldom meet these requirements in a satisfactory manner. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide G collapsible stroller type carriage which fulfils the requirements mentioned above in a better manner than previously known structures. The characterizing features of the carriage in accordance with the invention are apparent from the appended claims. The invention will now be described in detail in the following in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, on which a wheelchair or stroller implemented in accordance Witfl the invention is schematically illustrated as an example, and where Figure i is a perspective side view of the carriage 1 errected state, with the seat thereof only schematically illustrated with the aid of chain dotted lines figure 2 is a perspective view of the carriage seen from behird and with the seat removed for the sake of alarity and Figure 3 is a perspective side view of the carriage in a collapsed state, similarly with the sear renaved for the sate of clarity. The stroller carriage or wheelchair in acWerdance witl the invention and illustrated as an example nas a rectangular underframe formed by twe side members 1 and twe axles carrying wheeis 3. The axles 2 are united with the side merbers 1 with the aid of spring means allcxing the axles 2 a spring motion in the vertical direction relative the side members 1, but which are sc fermed that the memters 1 together with the axles 2 form a re angular fra which is generally rigid in the plane of the frare. The cellapsible superstructure of the earri includes two identical sets of articulatedly assenbled strut one on either side of the carriage. There is the on eithe side of the carriage a first, substantially stshapet srr t generally denoted by 5 with two generally mttually paralle end portions 5a and 5b with an interne per 5c uniting said perticne, the lerrer ferning anmgles both end portions 5a and 5b in e illustrates em ediment. The lcwer end of the first strut 5 is pivctably erracher t the forward end of the associated side member 1 of the und frame about ahorizontal piveting shaft . The strat assembly further includes, on either side of the sarriage, a senond straight strut 7, pivetahly attached at ins lewet end to the rear part of the side member 1 about a piveting shaft 8, and has its upper end articulatedly ected to one end of a third strut 9 about a heri ontal piveting she it, This third strut 9 is in turn pivenahly ected to the first strut 5 about a heri on al piveting shaft il situatec at, en in the vicini y ci. the angle between the end portion 5 and intermediate section 5c of the strut 5The strut is extended in an upwar d rettion and its un end icined to the corresponding strur on the er side of the carriage with the aid ci the carriage handle in. T er strute 5 and 7 are alse cin d to the rrespending strute on the ctter side of the car iage with the and of cross members 13 and 14, respectively. The seat 15 of the carriage, only schematically illustrated in Figure 1, can be manufactured to advantage from textile or plastic fabric, or similar material with possible necessary stiffening in the seat portion l5a and the back portion 15b. The seat is, in any case, implemented such that the seat portion 15a and back portion 15b are articulatedly connected to each other along the back edge of the seat portion 15a and the bottom edge of the back portion 15b.The seat is attached to struts 5 and 9 such that the seat portion 15a is carried by the strut 5, while the back portion 15b is carried by the strut 9. For this purpose there is a yoke 16, carrying the upper edge of the back portion 15, attached between the struts 9 on either side of the carriage. The yoke 16 is attached to the struts 9 with the aid of special attachments 17 enabling adjustment of the yoke 16 in different positions for altering the inclination of the back portion 15. It will be understood that the yoke 16 could also be replaced by a fixed cross member between the struts 9 on either side of the carriage. In the erected state of the carriage illustrated inFigure 1, the middle portion Sc of the strut 5 is substantially horizontal and forms an armrest or side support for the seat 15. To advantage, the seat 15 is implemented with whole side pieces, downwardly united with the seat portion 15a along its side edges, and rearwardly united with the back portion 15b along its side edges, while upwardly and forwardly being attached to the intermediate portions Sc and lower portions 5a, respectively, of the struts 5. In the erected state of the carriage, the connection point 10 between the struts 7 and 9 is situated in front of the connection point 11 between struts 9 and 5 as well as the attachment point 8 of the strut 7 to the side member 1 of the under frame. Struts 7 and 9 thus form a toggle which must be straightened out and collapsed in the opposite direction for the superstructure of the carriage to be collapsed to the state illustrated in Figure 3. As will be most clearly seen from Figure 2, the upper end portions 5b the strut 5 are obliquely directed to cross and lie behind E strut 9.It will be understood that the superstructure the carriage will accordingly be self locking in its ere ed ed state, such that it cannot be collapsed under the of of the weight of a person sitting in the seat 15. In es tat the superstructure shall be kept locked in its e ted state, even against collapse in the intended direc by moving the handle 12 forward, i.e. to the right inFigure i, there is a metal ring 18 on either strut 9, and ring can be pushed over the end 5b of the strut 5 so as encircle the latter resulting in that the strut 9 and str t 5 are locked to each other. It will be understood that a carriage implemented in accordance with the invention can be supplemented by further details not illustrated in detail on the drawing, e.g. a east attached to the lower portions 5a of the strut 5, a sunshade top and the like.
