# Embedding medium suitable for the preparation of thin sections of embedded biological materials.

## Abstract
The invention concerns embedding media for producing essentially non polar and polar embedding mediums. The non polar embedding medium comprises ethylmethacrylate, n hexylmethacrylate, triethyleneglycoidimethacrylate and a small amount of polymerisation initiator. The polar embed ding medium comprises 2 hydroxyethylacrylate, 2 hydroxypropylmethacrylate, n hexylmethacrylate, triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, and a small amount of polymerisation initiator. The embedding mediums of the invention are particularly suitable for the preparation of a polymer embedded biological material for light or electron microscopic study of thin sections thereof. The embedding mediums can be polymerised at low temperature and UV light employed for initiating polymerisation.
