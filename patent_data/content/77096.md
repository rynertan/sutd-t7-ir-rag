# CURABLE COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CURED COMPOSITION

## Abstract
The invention provides curable compositions com prising 1 100 part by weight of an epoxy compound containing at least one vicinal epoxy group, 2 from 1 to 25 parts by weight of a saturated poly alkyl acrylate having a molecular weight of less than 10,000 and a carboxyl functionality greater than 1.15 and 3 a curing amount of an epoxy curing agent, which compositions may be cured by application of heat. The composition may be used as adhesives, surface coatings, in preparing laminates, in castings, and in en capsulation of electrical equipment.
