# Tire sidewall protector shield assembly.

## Abstract
A removable resilient shield is maintained proximate the sidewall of a tire for off the road vehicles to protect this critical area of the tire from damage due to contact with external objects such as rocks. The shield is secured to the terminal portion of the rim flange. The radially inner portion of the shield is spaced axially of the rim and at least one radially extending passage is provided for removal of debris from between the shield and the sidewall of a tire mounted on the rim.
