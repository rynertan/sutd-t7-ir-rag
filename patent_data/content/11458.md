# Computerized tomographic apparatus with a continuously rotating source of X rays.

## Abstract
A tomographic scanner with a continuously rotating source of radiation 10 is energized by converting inertial mechanical energy to electrical energy. The mechanical to electrical conversion apparatus 40 is mounted with the X ray source 10 to be energized on a rotating flywheel 30,34 . The inertial mechanical energy stored in the rotating conversion apparatus, flywheel and X ray source is utilized for generating electrical energy used, in turn, to energize the X ray source.
