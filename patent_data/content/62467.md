# STABILIZER FOR ELECTRON DONOR ACCEPTOR CARBONLESS COPYING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A stabilizing agent for use in electron donor acceptor carbonless copying systems. The stabilizing agent is 2,2 methylene bis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol . Systems in which the stabilizing agent is useful comprise a color forming com position comprising at least one leuco dye which is fadeable or discolorable after development, a color developing composi tion comprising an acidic coreactant material capable of react ing with the color forming composition to provide colored pro ducts, and the stabilizing agent. The stabilizing agent prevents discoloration or fade of images produced by reaction of the co lor forming composition with the color developing composi tion. In a preferred embodiment, the color forming composi tion additionally comprises dithiooxamide and or dithiooxa mide derivatives, the color developing composition additional ly comprises a transition metal ion capable of reacting with the dithiooxamide compound to produce a purple colored pro duct, and the reaction of the color forming compositic with the color developing composition results in a neutral balclack colored product.
