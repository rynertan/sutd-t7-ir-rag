# STRONTIUM ALUMINUM FLUORIDE LASER

## Abstract
A solid state laser whose laser medium is a strontium aluminum fluoride crystal doped with chromium. This laser medium has a wavelength tuning range centered around 850nm and the laser gain is estimated to be a factor of 2 3 times higher than that of emerald and alexandrite lasers at room temperature.
