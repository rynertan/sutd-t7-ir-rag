# CATV communication system.

## Abstract
A decentralized communication arrangement is pro vided for a two way cable television CATV network wherein a node originating a message a source node and a node receiving a message a destination node can be located at any respective points in the CATV system. In one aspect, a source node transmits a message towards the headend of the upstream portion of the cable spectrum. The headend selectively rebroadcasts the upstream message in the down stream portion of the cable spectrum, thus providing an arrangement whereby a source node is able to transmit a message to a destination node, wherever located. Since, the CATV communication network is deployed to the general public, another aspect of the present system includes a mechanism by which the access to CATV communication resources is controlled so that unauthorized users are denied access and authorized users are granted access. In accord ance with this aspect, a source node further transmits a verification message, referred to herein as a frame verifier FV code, as part of the upstream message. The invention further provides for the headend apparatus to examine the frame verifier code and rebroadcast the received upstream message in the downstream portion of the cable spectrum only if the frame verifier code indicates that the source node is an authorized user, thereby granting the user access to the CATV resources. Conversely, the headend apparatus does not rebroadcast the upstream message if the frame verifier message indicates that the source node is not an authorized user thereby denying the user access to the CATV resources.
