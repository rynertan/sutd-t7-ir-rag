# Magneto optical recording medium and manufacturing method thereof.

## Abstract
According to a disk shaped magneto optical recording medium 10 of the invention, a transparent thin film 14 serving as an interference layer is formed on a transparent substrate 12 . The thin film 14 is subjected to a plasma surface treatment, thereby decreasing the fused oxygen content in at least a surface portion thereof. A recording layer 16 of a rare earth transition metal amorphous ferrimagne tic alloy thin film is formed on the plasma surface treated film 14 . Since the content of active, fused oxygen contained in at least the surface portion of the film 14 decreases, rare earth element oxide can hardly be formed in a boundary region 18 between the recording layer 16 and the transparent thin film 14 . The content of the rare earth element in this region 18 is smaller than the average content in the overall recording layer 16 .
