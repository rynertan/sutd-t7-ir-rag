# HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SUPERSONIC FLAME SPRAY METHOD AND APPARATUS WITH IMPROVED MATERIAL FEED

## Abstract
A supersonic flame spray apparatus 1, 1 utilizing an internal burner continuously feeds oxy fuel products of com bustion through an extended length nozzle 7, 37 of dimi nished throat area 14, 35 , supersonic expansion duct 15, 44 and an extended length nozzle passage 16, 36 . The expansion from the throat 14, 35 to the end of the expand ing duct provides a gas velocity of well in excess of super sonic velocity. Solid material in rod or particle form is in troduced axially or radially into the supersonic gas flow at the end of the expanding duct 15, 44 . This permits the extended length nozzle passage 16, 36 to have a relatively large diameter which prevents the solid material 4, 29 introduced to the flow to melt, reach the nozzle passage wall, and adhere thereto or abrade the nozzle wall, while permitting low pressure material injection into the gas flow stream G .
