## Description
The present invention relates to an automatic chamfering machine wherein the movement of a grinder wheel with respect to a workpiece is controlled by a tracer element urged against the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece itself, to remove a constant amount of material and uniformly chamfer the outer periphery on one end surface of the workpiece. Generally, various articles are formed with chamfered end surfaces for inherent purposes. Referring to one example, a ceramic honeycomb structural body used as a catalytic converter in the exhaust gas system of an automobile is generally of cylindrical configuration having in its cross section an elongated circular contour, with a number of parallel channels extending inside thereof between both end surfaces. Such a honeycomb structural body is thin walled and liable to be broken, so that it is necessary to prevent damages arising from temperature variation, etc., of the structural body accommodated in a catalyzer casing to the extent possible. In this connection, there has been a proposal to chamfer the outer periphery on both end surfaces of the structural body by applying a grinding operation thereto and removing a constant amount of material, as disclosed, e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 4,396,664. Conventionally, however, the above mentioned chamfering operation has been applied to the end surfaces of the honeycomb structural body manually by operating personnel. This results in poor productivity and makes it difficult to maintain a constant product quality because of fluctuation in the amount of removed material. One may thus consider that these drawbacks can be eliminated by making use of an automatic chamfering machine consisting of a profile grinding machine, which includes a tracer element adapted to be urged against the outer peripheral surface of a model to control the movement of a grinder wheel with respect to the workpiece. On the other hand, however, honeycomb structural bodies used as an automobile catalytic converter as mentioned above are often of different configuration and or size, depending upon the type of vehicles. Thus, when realising an automatic chamfering machine, the machine has to be adjusted to change models upon frequent alterations of the configuration or size of the produce. Such an adjustment of the machine necessitates troublesome and time consuming manual operations, and makes it still difficult to improve the producitivity. BE A 443009 discloses apparatus according to the precharacterising part of claim 1. The particular construction used in this prior art does not lend itself to use with the type of workpiece described above and further does not have provision for rapidly setting the machine up for differences in sizes and types of workpieces. Consequently, it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic chamfering machine which can be operated with a significantly improved productivity, without requiring adjustment of the machine for various configurations or size of the product. According to the present invention, there is provided a chamfering machine for workpieces having at least one end to be chamfered, comprising With the abovementioned arrangement of the present invention, the chamfering operation with respect to the outer periphery on the end surfaces of the workpiece is carried out by the autoprofiling operation of the grinder wheel, wherein the movement of the grinder wheel with respect to the workpiece is controlled by the tracer element urged against the outer peripheral contour of the workpiece itself. Thus, a constant amount of material can be removed from the outer periphery on the end surfaces of the workpiece. The adjustment of the machine is not required even upon alterations of the configuration or size of the product, and the removal of a constant amount of material can be carried out with respect to workpieces of any configuration or size. Moreover, the above mentioned autoprofiling operation permits a constant amount of material to be removed even when the workpiece is not clamped at a constant location. Consequently, an accurate positioning is not required for clamping the workpiece, and the production cost of the machine can be reduced. For a better understanding of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in Figs. 1 to 5 a chamfering machine according to one embodiment of the present invention, which may suitably be used to carry out chamfering operation with respect to brittle workpieces, such as ceramic honeycomb structural bodies. The machine, designated generally by reference numeral 1, includes a machine frame 2 on which is rotatably supported a turntable 3 having a substantially vertical axis of rotation. The turntable 3 is provided with a substantially horizontal upper surface to support thereon a plurality of workpieces As shown in Fig. 1, the turntable 3 has a plurality of openings 3a formed therein, which are equiangularly arranged on the circumference of the turntable so that the workpieces The clamping device 4 comprises, as shown in Fig. 2, an upper clamping disc 12 rotatably secured to the lower side of the free end of an arm 13 fixedly mounted on the frame 2, as well as a lower clamping disc 14 arranged in a vertically opposed relationship with the upper clamping disc 12 and rotatably secured to the upper end portion of a holder 15 arranged below the turntable 3. More particularly, the lower clamping disc 14 is secured to one end of a vertical shaft 16, which is adapted to be driven by a motor 17 accommodated in the holder 15, and is caused to rotate in a predetermined direction as the motor 17 is actuated. Furthermore, the holder 15 is supported by the frame 2 through two arms 18, 19 of a parallel motion mechanism such that the holder 15 can be lifted or lowered by controlling the actuation of an air cylinder device 20 connected to, and provided for moving the arm 18 vertically. The grinder wheel 5, as shown in Fig. 3, is secured to the lower end of a vertical shaft 21 rotatably supported by a bearing 22 mounted on the front end of an arm 23. A pulley 24 is secured to the upper end of the shaft 21, while a motor 25 is secured to the rear end of the arm 23 and has an output shaft to which is secured a pulley 26. A V belt 27 is arranged between the pulleys 24 and 26 so that the rotation of the motor 25 is transmitted to drive the grinder wheel 5. The grinder wheel 5, as shown in Fig. 3, is of disc like configuration formed by two frustoconical bodies, and has a grinding surface forming an angle with a horizontal plane, which is the chamfering angle of the workpiece The tracer element 6 is arranged below the grinder wheel 5, and has a radius smaller than that of the grinder wheel by a predetermined amount The arm 23 is supported by a vertical shaft 31 which is arranged on the frame 2 and rotatably journalled by a bearing 32. As shown in Fig. 4, the lower end of the shaft 31 is fixedly connected to one end of a lever 33. The lever 33 has a free end engaged by a spring 34, one end of which is connected with the frame 2 so as to bias the lever 33 in the direction of arrow The chamfering operation with respect to the workpiece When the turntable 3 rotates and feeds a workpiece By this means, the lower clamping disc 14 is moved upwardly to lift the workpiece Subsequently, the motor 17 is actuated to drive the lower clamping disc 14 at a relatively low speed in one direction, causing the workpiece In this condition, the grinder wheel 5 in its inoperative position as shown by imaginary lines in Fig. 1 is moved by the swinging motion of the arm 23 and urged against the outer periphery on the end surface of the workpiece More particularly, when the air cylinder device 37 is supplied with air, the plunger rod 36 is extended by a predetermined amount in the direction of arrow This rotation of the lever 33 results in a swinging motion of the arm 23, so that the grinder wheel 5 and the tracer element 6 are moved along an arcuate path in a direction substantially perpendicular to the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece Because the radius of the tracer element 6 is smaller than that of the grinder wheel 5, in the initial stage, the grinding surface of the grinder wheel 5 is brought into abutment with the outer periphery on one end surface of the workpiece Accordingly, the grinding operation on the outer periphery on the end surface of the workpiece Furthermore, the workpiece As the grinding operation to the workpiece Since the tracer element 6 is carried by the arm 23 by means of the bracket 28, the arm 23 is prevented from being rotated beyond the position in which the outer periphery of the tracer element 6 abuts against the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece Thus, eventually, the arm 23 is caused to swing by the tracer element 6 following the outer peripheral contour of the workpiece Upon completion of the chamfering operation, the air within the air cylinder device 37 is discharged to retract the plunger rod 36 in the direction of arrow The chamfered workpiece As explained above in detail, according to the present invention, the outer periphery on the end surface of the workpiece is chamfered by the autoprofiling operation, in which the tracer element in contact with the outer periphery of the workpiece follows the outer contour of the workpiece and controls the swinging motion of the grinder wheel. Thus, an accurate chamfering operation can be carried out by removing, by means of the grinder wheel, a constant amount of material from the outer periphery on the end surface of the workpiece with a constant grinding depth. Accordingly, the desired accurate chamfering operation can be carried out even when the workpiece has an irregular outer contour, or is inaccurately clamped at a different position. This provides advantages that the adjustment of the machine is not necessary even when the configuration or size of the product is altered, and the workpiece need not be positioned and clamped precisely as a constant amount of material can be accurately removed even when the workpiece is clamped at a different position. Thus, the present invention enables a chamfering operation by using less costly machine to remove an accurate amount of material in short a time, and thus makes it possible to adapt the operation to mass production with an improved yield and uniform product quality. Furthermore, besides the above mentioned ceramic honeycomb structural body, the present invention may be applied to chamfer workpiece consisting of extruded clay articles or the like, having similar technical problems.
