# Correlation detection type ultrasound blood flowmeter.

## Abstract
With a correlation detection type ultrasound blood flow meter 201 , for measuring speed of flowing blood which is passing across two sample volumes SV₂₁, SV₂₂ which are positioned at equal distances from the blood flowmeter along respective sound beams B₁, B₂ provided by the blood flowmeter 201 , the speed of flowing blood is mea sured by cross correlation time difference detection, and the detection is performed by using sample and hold volt ages obtained from echo signals C₁ t , C₂ t reflected from the flowing blood which is passing across the two sample volumes SV₂₁, SV₂₂ . In the blood flowmeter 201 , two qua drature detection circuits 401, 402 are provided for select ing echo signals arising from reflection by the flowing blood from echo signals arising from reflection by all bodies or substances located along the two sound beams B₁, B₂ , by eliminating echo signals arising from fixed bodies or sub stances located along the two sound beams. Two range gate circuits 43A, 43B are applied to each quadrature de tection circuit for extending the range of each sound sam ple volume, for enabling measurement of the speed of flowing blood which passes across the two sample volumes SV₂₁, SV₂₂ not perpendicularly but aslant with respect to a center line made by the directions of the two sound beams B₁, B₂ .
