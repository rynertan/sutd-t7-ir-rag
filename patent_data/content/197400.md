At the lower portion of the vessel 1, there is disposed an outlet port 7 for powdery or granular substance treated. A filter medium 8 comprising porous material is disposed at the bottom of the vessel 1, and below the filter medium 8 there are provided an inlet port 9 for drying gas and a discharge port 10 for filtrate. Inlet ports 9 can also be disposed at the top portion of the vessel 1 if desired. A stirring assembly 11 with spiral blade is disposed adjascent to the internal peripheral surface of the vessel 1. The top portion of the stirring assembly 11 is rotatably installed at the outer end portion of a supporting arm 12 which extends outwardly in radial direction. The stirring assembly 11 is driven by a motor assembly 6 for driving. The lower portion of the stirring assembly is usually unsupported as shown in Fig. 1, it might be, however, supported by a bearing means mounted at the bottom of the vessel 1 if desired. There is provided a temperature sensor 13 at a revolving shaft of the supporting arm 12. In an apparatus of the present invention, it is necessary to employ a vessel 1 having inverted frustoconical configuration with a vertical central axis in order to improve the efficiency of mixing and heat transfer. The vertical angle of the inverted frustoconical configuration is preferably 30 to 40 degrees. The shape of a filter medium 8 in the apparatus of the present invention is optionally selected from the disc, conical, hemispheric, and the like depending on the properties of powdery or granular substance to be treated. As a porous material constituting the filter medium 8, there can be employed a filter cloth, wire gauze, wedge wire screen, and the like individually.There can also be employed a combination thereof.
