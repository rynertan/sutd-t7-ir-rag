## Description
PROCESS FOR MAKING DRY FRICTION MATERIAL Description The present invention relates generally to friction materials and, more particularly, to such friction materials as are especially useful in dry environments. Still more particularly, it relates to a process for making such friction materials. The friction materials herein are useful in clutch assemblies, particularly where these are used in dry environments. A clutch assembly comprises a splined clutch mounting member to which is attached a friction facing. The means of attachment may be by riveting or cementing. Clutch facings may be made in any of several ways. Thus, in the so called dry process the several ingredients, including a partially cured thermosetting resin, are mixed and then placed in a shallow, annular mold and shaped at room temperature anc high pressure so as to cause the ingredients to flow and form a handleable preform. This flat, arcuate preform is then heated and the binder resin cured to its thermoset and permanent condition. In the roll forming process the ingredients are mixed with a solvent and a wet binder such as resin, oil, rubber, etc. The resulting slightly tacky grannules are fed into the nip of two form rollers which compress the mixture into a continuous tape.The tape is finish cured to shape in confining molds. The woven process involves the preparation of an asbestos cotton yarn which is passed through a dip tank containing a fluid mixture of various binders and fillers. The impregnated yarn is cured to a B stage, then converted to a preform as in U.S. 2,263,500 and the preform molded to the desired configuration at elevated temperatures and pressures. Still another method involves the preparation of a friction paper, prepared with or without a binder, on a paper making machine such as a Fourdrinier machine. The various fibrous components and fillers, with or without a binder are deposited from a very dilute aqueous slurry onto the Fourdrinier wire. The resulting paper product, if it does not already contain a binder resin, is impregnated with one, then cured. Such paper friction materials have ordinarily been utilized as clutch facing materials only for use in wet environments, e.g., in automatic transmissions. U.S. 4,279,696 Piersol shows the formation of a friction material on a Fourdrinier machine. The paper product contains cellulose fibers, meta fibers, a resin, rubber and inorganic fillers. U.S. 4,256,801 Chuluda also shows the formation of a friction material on a Fourdrinier machine.The friction material comprises a mixture of cellulose cotton fibers, carbon fibers, flame resistant organic fibers and, optionally, graphite particles and diatomaceous earth particles. The paper product is said to be useful in clutches, bands, brakes and the like operating in oil. U.S. 4,045,608 Todd et al. also deals with friction materials which are used with clutch plates, automatic transmissions and bands, all of which provide a fluid environment. The friction materials are paper like and are made on a paper making machine. The composition of the friction material comprises cellulose fibers, an inorganic absorbent filler and a retention agent to hold everything together, a first coating of a resin binder impregnant and a second outer coating of an ethyl silicate binder impregnant. The invention of the present application is a process for making a paper friction material suitable for use as a friction facing in a clutch or brake assembly in a dry environment comprising forming an aqueous slurry containing aromatic polyamide fibers, chopped glass fibers, a curable resin and fillers, preparing a paper product on a paper making apparatus from such aqueous slurry, and curing the resin containing paper product. The aromatic polyamide fibers, commonly known as aramids, are commercially available in various forms, e.g., yarn, pulp, etc. identified by the trademarks Fiber B, Kevlar, DP 01, 11Nomex, and others.Aramid is a generic expression denoting fibers made from the condensation product of isophthalic or tereph alic acids and m or p pehnylenediamine. Fiber and Kevlar are generally understood to identify products of the condensation of terephthalic acid and p phenylenediamine, while Nome is understood to identify the condensation product of isophthalic acid and m phenylenediamine. The term aramid has been defined as a manufactured fiber in which the fiber forming substance is a long chain synthetic aromatic polyamide in which at least 85 of the amide linkages are attached directly to two aromatic linkages. More information is contained in U.S. 3,393,210 which is incorporated herein by reference. The aramid prepared from terephthalic acid and p phenylenediamine is preferred. The aramid fibers preferably are in pulp form, i.e., they are very short and highly fibrillated. The fiber length is within the range of from 0.2 to 12 mm, preferably within the range of from 1 6 mm. The amount of aromatic polyamide fiber which should be used in the friction compositions herein ranges from about 1 to about 12 based on the weight of the uncured composition. Preferably, the amount is between about 2 and 10 . The glass fibers useful in the practice of the invention are those typically utilized for reinforcing cured resinous materials. The glass fiber surface is treated with a sizing composition to permit bonding of the glass surface to the matrix of the friction element. The sizing composition and its application to the individual glass filaments is described in U.S.4,130,537 Bohrer , incorporated herein by reference.The sized fibers may be coated with a resinous material to give a so called RFL coatec qlass fiber.These also are described in the Bohrer patent, but the preferred glass fibers herein are plain, chopped glass fibers. The physical form of the glass fibers in an important and critical element of the invention. It must be in the form of chopped strands, preferably from about 2.54 to about 25.4 mm in length, most preferably about 3.175 to about 12.70 mm. The amount of glass fibers in the friction composition herein should be from about 2 to about 15 , preferably from about 3 to about 12 , based on the weight of the uncured composition. Fillers are for the most part inorganic materials. They include diatomaceous earth, metal powders, graphite, alumina, mineral wool aluminum silicate or quarty fibers, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide paper filler clay, antimony sulfide, antimony oxide, wollastonite, cryolite, copper oxide, rottenstone, barytes, cardolite, natural rubber, and mica. The process of the present invention may be carried out in a conventional water laid paper making machine such as a Fourdrinier paper making machine or a rotoformer screen. The various ingredients, i.e., the aromatic polyamide fibers, chopped glass fibers, fillers and a curable resin, are dispersed in water to form a very dilute slurry having a concentration of from about 5 to about 10 solids by weight . This slurry is introduced, for example, to the head box of a Fourdrinier machine and thence onto the machine s endless open mesh belt to a depth of from about 12.7 to about 25.4 mm to insure a sufficiently thick paper product. This final product is passed through an oven or drum dryers at elevated temperatures to remove the last traces of water. As noted earlier herein the friction paper materials are useful in a dry environment. In such use their wear characteristics are especially important and this requirement in turn makes the thickness of the paper an important factor. The friction papers which result from the process of this invention are at least about 1.52 mm thick and may range up to as high as 7.62inn in thickness. In most instances they are from about 2 54 into about5.08 mm thick. The thicker papers, i.e. those having a thickness of from about 0.51 mm to about 7.62 inn are best prepared on a rotoformer screen whereas the papers of lesser thickness can be prepared conveniently on a Fourdrinier machine. The friction papers herein may be laminated to provide two or more thicknesses, if desired. Curable resins which are suitable for use herein include polyurethane resins, melamine formaldehyde resins, melamine aldehyde resins, silicone resins, phenolic resins and modified phenolic resins. The polyurethane resins usable for products of the invention are a combination of condensation products of polyesters and isocyanate compounds containing two or three NCO groups. The condensation products of polyesters are made, for instance, of adipic acid and triols like glycerin, hexane triols, trimethylol propane and diols like butylene glycol of phthalic acid and xylene formalkehyde. The isocyanate compounds used contain two or three NCO groups. Such isocyanates are phenyl disocyanate, p,p1 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, and triphenyl methane triiso cyanate. The polyesters chosen shall be of such a nature that the final combination product with the isocyanate shall be medium to hard. The preferred embodiment of polyurethane resins , for example, a 1 1 condensation mixture ofMultron 4 which is a polyester made from 2 1 2 mols adipic aci 0,5 5 mol phihalic acid and 4 mols triol and Mondur C Desmodur TH which has the following chemical composition EMI7.1 Usable melamine formaldehyde resins are obtained, for instance, by reacting approximately 2 3 mols of formaldehyde per mol of melamine. A spray dried melamine formaldehyde resin is prepared by spray drying a syrup obtained by reacting 2 mols of formaldekyde with each mol of melamine. Phenolic and modified phenolic resins found to be useful in our investigation were of the followi ng nature One step phenol formaldehyde alkaline catalyzed resoles one or two step phenol formaldehyde resins, ammonia or hexamethylene tetramine catalyzed of the novolac and resole type oil soluble heat reactive resin of the resole type phenol, cresol, alkylphenol, formaldehyde resins phenol aniline formaldehyde resins and phenol formaldehyde cashew nut shell liquid resins.Water borne resins are especially contemplated. The paper may also contain other components in order to further improve the desirable properties of the paper. Thus, the paper may contain from about 1 to about 10 , based on the weight of the paper of a binder in order to increase the strength of the paper.The binder may be an elastomeric compound or a resinous compound. Typical elastomeric compounds include chlorinated rubber, and synthetic rubbers, such as neoprene polychloroprene and butadiene acrylonitrile copolymers sold under the trade name of Hear. Suitable resinous binders include nylon polyacrylic resins, such as polymethacrylate and polymethylmethacrylate and polyvinyl acetate. The preferred binders are neoprene latex and butadiene acrylonitrile copolymers. The binders can be incorporated into the paper either by sizing the stock, i.e., adding the binder solutions or emulsions to the stock and flocculating the same, or by spray methods or the use of a size press. The paper production obtained from the papermaking apparatus may be cured immediately after it has been dried or at some later time, or it may first be cut into sections and then cured. In a preferred instance it may be cut into arcuate sections, so as to be formable into a circular clutch facing, and then cured. Or, it may be cut into arcuate sections after advance curing to a stage at which the paper is not tacky to the touch. In either instance, i.e., whether cut first or cured first, the paper may be laminated to form a thicker, longer wearing friction body. Lamination may be accomplished by heating at a temperature of from about 93.3 C 2000F to about 204.40C 4000F , e.g., under pressure 71.3 211.9 kg cm2, i.e. 1000 psig 3000 psig to further cure the resin and adhere the surfaces of the two or more laminates. Ordinarily the impregnating resin solution will be a solution in denatured alcohol, methanol, acetone or the like.
