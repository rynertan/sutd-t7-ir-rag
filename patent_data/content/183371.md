# Multi position bed.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a multi position bed such as is used in hospitals for persons who by reason of physical disability or age are unable to turn or move themselves in bed. As shown in Figure 4 the bed comprises a base frame 1 supported on casters and having a pair of pivoted angled lifting arms 2 . One of the pair of lifting arms is pivoted in turn to an interlink pivoted to a pivot bracket 4 . The other lifting arm 2 is pivoted directly to a second pivot. The pivot brackets 4 and 5 act as the pivot supports for the centre section 6 of a mattress platform which also comprises two side sections 7 . The side sections 7 are not hinged directly to the centre section but simply have interengaging features in the form of side frame registers 11 . When the bed is used as a turning bed the interengag ing features 11 disengage. The side sections 7 are carried by pairs of links 8 and 9 which join the pivot brackets 4 to the side sections 7 at points underneath the side sections. These side sections are also connected by side frame pivot arms 13 to an end pivot frame 12 , at each end of the bed, the pivot frame 12 being rigidly connected to the centre bed section 6 . The move ment of the bottom links 8 is restricted, in a downward direction, by bottom link stops 10 . The links 8, 9 may be disconnected and the side sections 7 connected rigidly to the centre section 6 so that the mattress platform can be caused to tilt bodily in a lateral sense.
