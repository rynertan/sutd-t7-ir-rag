# Container for determining the quantity of antibodies or antigens in a biological liquid.

## Abstract
A container for determining antibodies or antigens in a biological liquid by the formation of specific antibody antigen complexes, in which one partner element is initially associated with suspended magnetic parti cles that are subsequently regrouped against a certain area of one wall 8 of the container when the container is positioned within a magnetic field that extends through that area of the wall. To prevent the particles from sliding down when the magnetic field is eliminated and to allow effective pipetting, the lower part of said area of the wall is adjacent to a plane surface 7 that is at an obtuse angle to said wall and tangent to a concave surface 5 that is itself tangent to a wall 6 of the container opposite to the wall that is at an obtuse angle.

Container for measuring antibodies or antigens in a biological liquid by forming specific antibody antigen complexes, in which one of said antigen or antibody element is initially associated with suspended magnetic particles that are subsequently regrouped against a certain area of one side wall of the container when the container is positioned within a magne tic field that extends through that area of the wall, this being for selectively removing the liquid phase, characterized in that this portion of the side wall holding the regrouped particles is adjacent to the bottom of said container, this bottom comprising at least a portion of area of straight generant, coplanar with the side wall generant and at a blunt angle thereto.

## Description
The present invention concerns a container for measuring antibodies or antigens in a biological liquid by creating specific antibody antigen complexes, in which one element of the complex is initially associated with suspended magnetic particles that are subsequently regrouped against a certain area of one wall of the container when the container is positioned within a magnetic field that extends through that area of the wall. A method of adding antibodies or antigens to a biological liquid is known. It consists of suspending in the liquid magnetic particles associa ted with either antigens or antibodies specific to the respective antibo dies or antigens that are to be ascertained in sufficient excess to ensure that all the antibodies or antigens to be measured will combine with a respective antigen or antibody specific to them. The magnetic particles are then attracted to one wall of the container, all substances except the magnetic particles associated with their specific antigen or antibody reactant combined or uncombined with their respective antibody or antigen partner are evacuated from the container, the container is rinsed out, a reaction liquid is introduced to create an enzymatic reaction with the antibodies or antigens, the particles are suspended in the liquid for a prescribed period, an agent is added to the liquid to terminate the reac tion, the magnetic particles are again attracted to the one wall of the container, and the reaction liquid is measured colorimetrically. Attracting the magnetic particles to the bottom of a dish and evacua ting the biological liquid by turning the dish upside down along with the magnet, which would then maintain the particles against the bottom, has already been proposed. This procedure, however, is not very practical. Turning a dish upside down inside automatic analysis equipment necessitates a large number of mechanisms. It is also necessary to make provisions for collecting the liquid that spills out of the dishes. One variation of the proposed method involves positioning the magnet at one side of the dish to attract the magnetic particles to a certain area of the wall. The bottom of the dish accordingly consists of a cavity, either in the form of a spherical cap tangent to a tubular body in the case of a dish with a circular cross section or by a cavity with a straight generatrix parallel to two opposing faces of the tube and tangent to the faces in the case of a dish with a rectangular cross section. The cavities that are tangent to the tubular section of the dish are intended to promote stirring the liquid and prevent dead zones in which it will remain statio nary during agitation, making the mixture non homogeneous. The drawback to a dish bottom of this particular shape is that the magnet that attracts the magnetic particles to a certain area of the wall has to be constantly retained at that area in order to maintain them against the wall. This implies in turn that, in automatic analysis equipment in which the dishes are transported from one operating point to another by a conveyor, the magnet must be part of the conveyor, requiring one magnet for each dish as well as means of shifting the magnet between an active and inactive posi tion. Such a solution is complicated and hence expensive. If the magnets are positioned only along the sections of the path of the conveyor within which the magnetic particles are to be attracted to the particular portion of the wall of the dish, the particles will slide farther along the wall every time the conveyor shifts the dish from one magnet to the next and will eventually arrive more or less at the bottom of the dish. Inasmuch as the whole method of collecting the magnetic particles within a certain area of the wall of the dish is intended to allow evacuation of the liquid with a pipette, some of the particles that slide down to the bottom will also be evacuated and will inadmissibly contaminate the measurement results. The object of the present invention is to at least to some extent eli minate the drawbacks of the aforesaid methods. This object is attained in accordance with the invention in a contai ner for adding antibodies or antigens as recited in Claim 1. The advantage of this container is that the surface at an obtuse angle to one lateral face of the dish briefly prevents the collected magnetic particles from sliding. When the magnetic particles collect against the la teral face of the container that is adjacent to the obtuse angle and within the area of the face that is adjacent to the apex of the angle, although briefly released from the effect of the magnetic field that has collected them, the particles are actually prevented from sliding down due to the oblique face at an obtuse to the lateral face that they collect against. Furthermore, since the oblique face is tangent to a concave area that is itself tangent to the opposite lateral face, the shape of the bottom of the container will not allow dead zones while the liquid is being mixed because the shape will essentially coincide with the rounded shape of the dish. A dish bottom of this shape will allow pipetting below the level at which the particles are collected, and both the biological liquid and the rinse can be evacuated from the container. One embodiment and a variant of the invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawing, in which The illustrated embodiment of a container in accordance with the in vention see figures 1 and 2 consists of a tubular element 1 divided into two compartments 3 and 4 that are rectangular in cross section and taper slightly out and up by a partition 2. One compartment is intended to accomodate a sample to be analyzed along with its appropriate reagent or reagents and the other to accomodate a control substance that functions as a reference for the particular test being conducted along with its appro priate reagent or reagents. The invention is obviously not restricted to an embodiment employing only two compartments. It will be evident from Figure 2 that the section of the bottom of the container is not an arc of a circle tangent to two opposing lateral faces as in all other analysis containers of this type. The actual shape is intended to prevent the establishment of dead zones while the liquid is being agitated. The cross section of the bottom is on the other hand an arc 5 of a circle that, while it is tangent to one lateral face 6 of the container, is not tangent to the opposite lateral face but to an oblique face 7 that is itself at an obtuse angle to the opposite lateral face 8. The area of opposite lateral face 8 that is adjacent to the obtuse angle with oblique face 7 is intended to be positioned opposite a permanent magnet 9. The magnet collects the magnetic particles 10 suspended within compartments 3 and 4 for the purpose specified previously herein. The particular obtuse angle beween faces 7 and 8 in the illustrated embodiment is 110 . The closer the angle is to 90 the more the particles will be retained against the base of opposite lateral face 8, although, if the angle were exactly 90 , the bottom of the container and the lower part of the area that the particles collect in would be at the same level. Further more, the closer the angle is to 90 the greater the risk of a dead zone while the liquid is being agitated. It is, rather, preferable as previously discussed herein, for the point of the pipette to arrive below the lower part of the area that the particles collect in. In practice, the angle between faces 7 and 8 is preferably between 105 and 120 . The area of the lateral face 8 that magnetic particles 10 are supposed to collect in approximately coincides with an area of the wall of each compartment 3 and 4 that is provided with a depressed annular surface 11 Fig. 2 surrounding a circular area 12 as thick as the rest of the wall. Depressed annular surface 11 is entended as a sort of a flexible diaphragm that, although it is in one piece with the wall of the container, can move elastically in relation to the rest of the wall. There is a groove 13 in the center of the inside of circular area 12. Annular surface 11, circular area 12, and groove 13 are intended to transmit to the liquid the ultraso nic vibrations generated by a transducer positioned against cicular area 12 in order to agitate the liquid in consequence of the cavitation thereby induced in it. It should be emphasized that the annular surface 11 is located in the vicinity of the apex of the angle between faces 7 and 8. This location is preferable in that it also helps prevent the establishment of dead zones in the only region of the liquid where the agitation could possibly be attenuated. Furthermore, once the particles have been collected in the area of wall 8 adjacent to the obtuse angle and when they are to be resuspended, the ultrasound will be able to act directly on them and dis perse them. The outside diameter of the annular surface 11 in the illustrated embodiment is 6 mm and its inside diameter 2 mm. The wall of the container is 0.8 mm thick and the annular surface 0.3 mm thick. The container is extruded of polystyrene or polyacralate. Although the compartments 3 and 4 in the illustrated embodiment are in the shape of tubes with a rectangular cross section it will be obvious that the invention can also be unrestrictedly applied to tubes with a dif ferent cross section, circular for example. The rectangular shape, however, will permit colorimetric measurements of the liquid, which is facilitated when the beam can pass through parallel surfaces. Figure 3 illustrates a variant in which a tubular enclosure is used. In this variant, the enclosure bottom consists of a frustoconical portion 15 whose bevel angle is of about 120 and 150 . This frustoconical portion is terminated by a spherical cap 16 for ensuring a complete aspiration of the liquid phase, which operation would be more difficult if the bottom were conically shaped.
