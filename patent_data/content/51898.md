# Passive dosing dispenser employing a captive air bubble to provide product isolation.

## Abstract
A passive dosing dispenser for issuing, for example, a volume of a toilet tank additive solution into a toilet tank as the water is draining therefrom while the toilet is flushing. A preferred dispenser 20 comprises a product chamber 69 for containing a quantity of a solid type product 21 which can be dissolved in water to form a toilet tank additive product solution, a solution reservoir 65 for containing a quantity of said solution in fluid communication with said product chamber, an inlet discharge conduit 80 having its lowermost end in fluid communication with said solution reservoir and its uppermost end in fluid communication with a syphon tube 44 , a first air trap 81 disposed adjacent said inlet discharge conduit for trapping an air bubble that is used for isolating said product solution from the toi et tank water in the syphon tube during quiescent periods, a second air trap 82 disposed adjacent the syphon tube for retaining the air bubble while the water is draining from the toilet tank during flushing, a discharge reservoir 85 disposed at the outlet end of the syphon tube to retard the discharge of the toilet tank additive product solution to that the discharge requires a pre determined period of time, and an air vent 83 in fluid communication with the solution reservoir and the prod uct chamber. In operation, while the water in the toilet tank is receding from about the dispenser, a quantity of the product solution is syphoned from the solution reservoir through the inlet discharge conduit and dis pensed through the syphon tube and the discharge res ervoir and out the inlet discharge port 78 . In a prefer red embodiment, the dispenser provides a pair of air locks when it is completely immersed in a full toilet tank. The air locks isolate the product and product solution from toilet tank water which surrounds the dispenser during quiescent periods.
