## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVE N The present invention relates to steam traps, and more particularly, to thermostatic steam traps. Thermostatic steam traps are known for draining condensate from steam lines. Examples of such traps are disclosed in the following United States patents 1,037,228 J. L. Fitts Sept. 3, 1912 2,629,553 A. K. Velan Feb., 24, 1953 2,781,173 A. Bahr Feb. 12, 1957 3,042,363 D. B. Deeks July 3, 1962 3,169,704 U. Domm et al Feb. 16, 1965 3,344,672 J. S. Lingnau Oct. 3, 1967 3,362,636 Sentaro Miyawalci Jan. 9, 1968 3,620,449 G.Hohn et al Nov. 16, 1971 Although the aforementioned patented steam traps may operate satisfactorily, not all fail in the open position. Moreover, none are as compact, simple and inexpensive in construction and operation as is desirable and include easily replaceable operating parts. In light of the foregoing, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved steam trap of the thermostatic variety. Another object of the present invention is to provide a thermostatic steam trap which fails in the open position so as to to allow continued draining of condensate and ready detection. A further object of the present invention is to provide a thermostatic steam trap which adequately drains condensate yet closes at a temperature which closely follows the steam saturation curve to allow the trap to operate over a wide range of pressure without expensive steam loss. An even further object of the present invention is to provide a thermostatic steam trap which is simple and compact in design and construction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION More specifically, in the present invention there is provided a thermostatic steam trap having an insert assembly which includes an annular member with a valve seat surrounding a valve member which seats in a direction opposite the normal fluid flow through the trap. The upper end of the valve member is is attached to a cup shaped cage containing a thermally responsive bellows. Movement of the cage in the downward direction is impeded by a plurality of downward protuberances in contact with the above mentioned annular member.An increase in the temperaIt ture of the fluid flowing through the trap actuates the bellows to to expand upward pulling the cage and the attached valve member , into a seated position, thus blocking the fluid flow into the outlet passage. The thermostatic steam trap self centers its valve member by way of legs on the bellows assembly and a pair of contour plates which pivot upon one another. The result is a steam trap which is simple in operation and requires less service. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The operation, features and advantages of the present invention should become apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an enlarged sectional view of a thermostatic steam trap embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2 2 ofFigure 1 and Figure 3 is an enlarged sectional view of a modified version of the thermostatic steam trap. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INUNT1ON Referring to the drawings, there is illustrated in Figs. 1 1 and 2 a thermostatic steam trap 10. As may be seen therein, the steam trap 10 has a trap body member 11 having an internally threaded inlet 12 adapted to be connected to a pressurized steam line not shown from which condensate is to be drained, and is internally threaded at the opposite end to connect to an outlet fitting 13 with an internally threaded outlet 14 adapted to be connected to a condensate sump line not shown . A strainer 35 is positioned at the pressurized steam line end of the trap body member 11 separating the inlet 12 from a control chamber 16, the longitudinal center line of which is disposed coaxially with the longitudinal center lines of the inlet 12 and outlet 14. The control chamber 16 contains an insert assembly 17 which includes an.annular member 18 providing a valve seat 19 which completely surrounds the valve member 20. A cup shaped cage 21, which has affixed to its downward face the valve member 20, is also provided as part of the insert assembly. Three circular downward protuberances 24 are provided on the downward face of the cup, each equally spaced from the base of the affixed valve member 20 and from one another. Three uniform circular holes 25 are formed in the downward cup face, each equally spaced from one another and equally spaced from the protuberances 24. Legs 26, formed on a bellows support member 27, project downwardly, one through each of the holes 25, into engagement with the annular member 18 to maintain a bellows 28 at a predetermined location in the control chamber 16. A perforated top plate 30, having a series of openings 31, is secured such as by welding, to the top of the cage 21. Thus, the bellows is loosely contained within the cage.Pivot means is provided between the bellows and the top plate, which, together with the legs 26, permits the valve member 20 to be self centering when pulled to its closed position. This pivot means may include a contoured pivot plate Ii 32 at the upper end of the bellows and having an upward central projection 33 engaged within an upward recess 34 in the center of li the top plate 31. Alternatively, the pivot plate could have an upwardly facing recess engaged by a downwardly extending projec tion on the top plate. i In the illustrated embodiment, the bellows 28 contains a small quantity of fluid which has a somewhat lower vaporizing point than that of water, for example, alcohol. When the tem perature in the control chamber is below the vaporization point of the bellows fluid, which will occur when condensate is present in in the trap, the bellows 28 will be in its closed or contracted condition, thereby permitting the valve to open and discharge the condensate. The pressure differential between the control chamber 16 and the outlet passage 14 will cause the valve member 20 to be displaced axially away from the valve seat 19, thus allowing the condensate to drain from the control chamber into the outlet passage 14 and into the condensate sump line. As the temperature begins to approach the heat of vaporization for the bellows fluid, the fluid will begin to vaporize with a correspond ing expansion in the bellows 28.The legs 26, which, in the pressurized system, contact the annular member 18, prevent downward expansion of the bellows 28. Accordingly, the bellows 28 will expand axially upward or in a direction away from the valve seat il with a corresponding upward movement of the pivot plate 32, which displaces the top plate 30 and the attached cage 21 axially upward. The valve member 20, attached to the cage 21, thus begins to close on the valve seat member 19, resulting in a decrease in the discharge of condensate.When the temperature i nears the desired closing temperature, the bellows fluid should be be at or approaching a completely vaporized state with the bellows 28 28 near full expansion, the pressure differential between the control chamber 16 and the outlet passage 14 being sufficient to to prevent the valve member 20 from seating on the valve seat 19, thus continuing to permit the discharge of condensate.Finally, when the temperature approaches the design closing temperature, the vapor pressure in the bellows 28 is great enough to overcome II the pressure difference maintaining the valve member in an un seated position, fully expanding the bellows 28, displacing the 11 cage 21 fully axially upward and seating the valve member 20 against the valve seat 19, thus stopping any discharge through the steam trap. As the system cools, the process reverses itself, again allowing the discharge of condensate. Because of the difference in vapor pressure relationship between water and alcohol in the bellows, operation of the bellows would tend to cause the trap to operate increasingly below the steam saturation curve with increasing pressure. However, in the steam trap of the present invention, there is a pressure imbalance on the valve member tending to maintain the valve in the open position. The pressure imbalance is equal to the difference between the upstream and downstream pressures times the area of the valve seat opening. This imbalance in pressure will thus resist closing and aid in operiing of the trap against the normal forces of the bellows.By careful sizing of the valve seat opening and or changes in the type of alcohol, operation of the trap can be designed to closely follow the steam saturation curve, preventing undue steam loss, while permitting the maximum condensate discharge. ii The legs 26, the upward projection 33 of the pivot plate 32 and the downwardly facing indentation 34 of the top plate 30 all serve to center the cage 21 and properly malign the valve member 20. The invention has the advantage of failing in an open position upon bellows failure , thus allowing continued discharge of condensate and ready detection of trap failure, since the loss of bellows fluid will collapse the bellows 28 and accordingly open the valve member 20. It has the further advantage of operating t very efficiently by closely approximating the saturation curve for steam. Moreover, the device is relatively simple and in expensive. Figure 3 shows a modified form of steam trap embodying the invention of the apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2. This steam trap includes a body member 40 having an inlet opening 41 at one end thereof and an outlet opening 42 at the opposite end thereof. In addition, an upwardly extending boss 43 is provided on the steam trap which, in turn, has a generally cylindrical threaded recess 44. A bonnet 45 is provided which may be threaded into the recess 44 forming a control chamber 46. Positioned within the recess 44 beneath the bonnet 45 is an adapter plug 47. Inlet and outlet passages 48 and 49 respectively, are provided in the adapter plug which in tu communicate with inlet and outlet passages 50 and 51, respect lively, in the body member 40, providing fluid communication fromI the inlet opening 41 through the body portion and adapter to the control chamber and then to the outlet opening 42. When the bbnnet is fully inserted into the cylindrical recess 44 of the body portion, it engages against the adapter and forces the adapter tightly against seal means 52, providing a fluid tight seal between the inlet and outlet passages. Positioned within the control chamber 46 and secured to i the adapter 47, for example by a force fit, is an insert assembly 17 which preferably is a duplicate of the insert assembly 17 of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2. The insert assembly of Figure 3 operates in exactly the same manner and performs exactly the same function as the insert assembly of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2. When condensate is present at the control chamber 46, the bellows contracts permitting condensate to pass through the steam trap. Similarly, as the temperature in the control. chamber is increased by the presence of steam in the control chamber, the bellows expands causing the valve carried by the insert assembly to close. While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is not intended to limit the invention to such a disclosure, and changes and modifications may be incorporated and embodied therein within the scope of the following claims.
