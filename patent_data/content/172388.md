# Apparatus for adsorbing vapours and gases.

## Abstract
An apparatus for absorbing vapours and gases, particularly such which are emitted during the glass etching process, is composed of a demister 2 connected to a gas absorber 10 through a ventilator 9 . The demister 2 comprises a cylindrical tank in which two perforated partitions 3, 4 are placed in a trough 6 . Between the partitions 3, 4 an absorptive mass 5 is arranged. The demister 2 has in its cylindrical part an inlet opposite to which a screen 1 is placed, and an outlet 8 in the bottom thereof. The outlet 8 is provided with a conduit, the one end whereof is connected to the sucking side of the ventilator 9 and the second end whereof is placed in the tank at a level higher than that of the bottom of the trough 6 . The gas absorber 10 is a rectangular tank in which two partitions 11 are placed, between which an active mass 12 is placed. The apparatus enables an almost total purification of vapours and gases emitted during the process of glassetching.
