# Alpha oxyalkylene amine oxide compounds and their use in detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Compounds which are carboxylic acids, or their salt, ester or amide derivatives, having an oxyalkylene amine oxide substituent at the alpha carbon atom are disclosed. The compounds are useful as detergent surfactants which provide outstanding cleaning, particularly of oily soils, under cold water laundering conditions. Detergent compo sitions containing the compounds also preferably contain other surfactants, builders, and detergent adjunct materials.
