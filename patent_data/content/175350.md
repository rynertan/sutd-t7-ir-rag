# CONTAINER MOUNTING BRACKET

## Abstract
A container mounting system includes mounting brack et and container components. The mounting bracket compo nent generally includes a rear plate member and at least one mounting flange fixed to the plate member to define a space therebetween. The mounting flange pierces a wall of a container such that another wall of the container is dis posed in the space between the mounting flange and rear plate member. Structure to capture a portion of the contain er when in a mounted position on the bracket is provided to resist forces tending to separate the container from the bracket while yet permitting a user to remove the container from the bracket when desired. Guide surfaces disposed in the space between the mounting flange and the rear plate member bias the container away from obstructions, such as screw heads or the like, during mounting of the container onto the bracket. The container component includes oppos ing pairs of walls which define an interior cavity. One of the walls having a linear array of alternating cut and uncut por tions disposed substantially parallel to and separated from a corner defined by a wall mutually perpendicular to the one wall so that the linear array registers with the mounting flange of the mounting bracket component.
