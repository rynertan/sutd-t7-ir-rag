# Very fast fading photochromic glass.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to photochromic glasses exhibiting a darkened luminous transmittance at 40 C below 35 and a five minute fading rate at 40 C of at least 40 units of transmittance and a darkened transmittance at 25 C below 25 and a five minute fading rate at 25 C of at least 35 units of transmittance consist essentially, by weight, of SiO₂ 56 60 Al₂O₃ 6 9 B₂O₃ 18 21 Li₂O 2.5 3.5 Na₂O 0.5 3.5 K₂O 5 7 ZrO₂ 3.75 5 PbO 0.1 0.15 Ag 0.15 0.25 Cl 0.2 0.35 Br 0.075 0.15 CuO 0.004 0.02 CeO₂ 0 0.5 wherein the levels of Ag, Br, Cl and CuO represent values as analysed in the glass.
