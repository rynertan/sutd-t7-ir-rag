# A scanning head for an optical disc system.

## Abstract
In a scanning head for an optical disc system, a light beam from a laser 12 is transmitted through a monomode optical fiber 28 and then focussed on a record carrying surface of an optical disc 16 by a converging lens 22 . The end of the fiber 28 can be reoriented within orthogonal planes perpendicular to the plane of the record carrying surface by transducers 36, 38 so as to correct for tracking and timing errors. The laser diode 12 can function both as an emitter and, in an external cavity mode, as a detector of light reflected from the disc 16 . Drive to the transducers 36, 38 is dependent on tracking and speed error signals generated from the detected light. For tracking and speed error compensa tion, only lens fiber end, and, optionally, a collimating lens 34 , which are negligible weight, need be moved rather than the entire scanning head. This provides a simple structure having a high frequency response and low power consumption.
