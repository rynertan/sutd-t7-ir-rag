# APPARATUS FOR CONTINUOUSLY GRANULATING AND DRYING SINGLE CELL PROTEIN

## Abstract
Apparatus for the continuous granulation and drying of single cell protein which comprises a plurality of compo nents in combination including a granulator, gas heating means and a cyclone. The components are connected in such a manner that a stream of wet single cell protein product from a fermenter can pass into the granulator and from the granulator into a heated gas stream which carries it to a cyclone. After leaving the cyclone a proportion of the granulated product is returned to the granulator.
