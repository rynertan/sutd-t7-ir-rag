# A method of photoetching polyesters.

## Abstract
This invention discloses a method for photoetching polyesters, such as polyethylene teraphthalate PET , efficiently, and without causing degradation or heating of the bulk of the PET material. At least about 1000 ANGSTROM of the polyester are removed by application of ultraviolet radiation having wavelengths less than 220 nm. To enhance the process, irradiation can occur in the presence of oxygen or air.
