## Abstract
A plurality of photovoltaic conversion elements, having opposed electrodes 2, 6, 32, 36 and photovoltaic conversion layers 5, 35 therebetween, are formed as an array on a sub strate 1, 31 to convert incident light from an image plane to be read into electrical signals. The electrical signals are trans ferred to a plurality of signal reading circuits which are con structed by a plurality of integrated circuits 8 , via a plurality of conductive strips 3, 33 , having wiring patterns of non uni form lengths formed on the substrate. The sums of the areas of the conductive strips 3, 33 , with the areas of the elec trodes 2, 32 to which the conductive strips are connected, are made substantially equal to make the sums of the stray capacitances of the conductive strips with the interelectrode capacitances of the photovoltaic conversion elements sub stantially equal.
