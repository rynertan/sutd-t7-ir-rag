## Description
The present invention relates to a novel anti thrombogenic polyurethane polymer and process for making the same. More particularly the invention relates to a polyurethane polymer having an anti thrombogenic material covalently bonded thereto so that the material is permanently affixed to the polymer and remains virtually nonleachable when the products made from the reaction product are in use. Extensive investigations have been undertaken over many years to find materials that will be biologically and chemically stable towards body fluids. This area of research has become increasingly important with the development of various objects and articles which can be in contact with blood, such as artificial organs, vascular grafts, probes, cannulas, catheters and the like. Artificial materials are being increasingly used as blood contact devices and may be subject to potential generation of thrombus. When blood contacts a foreign material, a complex series of events occur. These involve protein deposition, cellular adhesion and aggre gation, and activation of blood coagulation schemes. Considerable research effort has been focused on this blood material interaction in the last twenty years. The overall objective of these investigations has been to minimize the potential for thrombus formation on the foreign materials, such as the device when introduced into the body upon contact with blood. Early work by R. I. Leininger and R. D. Falb, U.S. Patent No. 3,617,344, was based on binding quater nary amines to a polymer surface and subsequently ionically binding heparin thereto. In contrast, H. M. Grotta established a method in U.S. Patent No. 3,846,353 in which heparin was complexed with a quaternary amine on a polymer surface. Both the Leininger et al. and Grotta methods have the disadvantage of being non permanent or leachable systems. In general, ionically bound systems have limited viability due to their inherent leachability. J. Love and G. W. Holmes patented a method for the preparation of antithrombo genic surfaces in U.S. Patent No. 3,616,935 wherein polyalkylenimines are used to irreversibly absorb the antithrombogenic compound to cellulose, cellulose esters, silicone rubber, polypropylene, polycarbonate and glass through the formation of ionic bonds. The Love et al. technique, however, was not able to over come the deficiencies of the prior techniques, notably leaching of the antithrombogenic material rendering the system non permanent and ineffective for long term internal use in the body. U.S. Patent No. 3,826,678 of A.S. Hoffman and G. Schmer relates to a covalent bonding method involving the use of soft hydrogel surfaces wherein radiation grafting is employed with a reactable compound selected from polymers and copolymers on an inert polymeric substrate and thereafter a biologically active compound is chemically bound to the reactable compound. Soft gel like surfaces are not appropriate for devices such as catheters or other medical devices which require a hard polymer surface. The soft hydrogel or hydro philic surface of the Hoffman et al. patent would be subject to being stripped off catheters and in case of other blood contact devices, be devoid of the mechanical properties required. Hard polymers would provide the mechanical strength required in such applications. U.S. Patent No. 4,326,532 to Hammar discloses a layered medical article having an antithrombogenic surface wherein a natural or synthetic polymeric sub strate is reacted with chitosan and the antithrombogen is then bonded to the chitosan. Hammer discloses on column 3, lines 10 to 49 that the antithrombogenic material may be ionically bonded to the chitosan or covalently bonded using boron hydrides. In contrast to the aforementioned techniques, Larm et al. disclosed in A New Non Thrombogenic Surface Prepared by Selective Covalent Bonding of Heparin via A Modified Reducing Terminal Residue, Biomat., Med. Dev., Art. Org., 283 pages 161 173 1983 a new method for binding heparin to artificial surfaces. The procedure described involved partially degrading heparin and coupling the fragments through their reducing termi nal units. Heparin was then ionically and covalently coupled to different surfaces with best results achieved using polyethylenimine containing primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups. It would be desirable to provide a material which has excellent biological and chemical stability towards body fluids, namely blood, and which retains its anti thrombogenic agent in a permanent and non leachable fashion when in contact with blood. It would also be desirable to provide materials which, while being bio compatible, are also biofunctional, that is, materials which have biological activity in a variety of functions. The present invention accomplishes all of these needs by use of a specific covalently bonded anti thrombogenic agent to a solid support. More particu larly the invention involves an antithrombogenic polyurethane polymer having a a support substrate b a protonated amine rich polyurethane urea bonded to said support substrate and c an aldehyde containing antithrombogenic agent reacted with the amine function ality of said polyurethane urea to form a covalently bonded antithrombogenic material. In another embodiment, the present invention involves a process for imparting antithrombogenic activity to polyurethane polymer materials which comprises a treating the surface of a solid support with a solution of a protonated amine rich polyurethane urea so that the polyurethane urea is bonded to the support substrate b removing solvent from the treated substrate to form a layer of the polyurethane urea upon the support substrate c activating the amine function ality on the polyurethane urea by use of an alkaline buffer to form free amine groups and d reacting the free amine groups with an aldehyde containing antithrom bogenic agent to covalently bond the antithrombogenic agent to the polyurethane urea in the presence of a reducing agent. The term antithrombogenic agent or material as used herein refers to any material which inhibits thrombus formation on its surface, such as by reducing platelet aggregation, dissolving fibrin, enhancing passivating protein deposition, or inhibiting one or more steps within the coagulation cascade. Illustra tive antithrombogenic material may be selected from the group consisting of heparin, prostaglandins, urokinase, streptokinase, sulfated polysaccharide, albumin and mixtures thereof. The antithrombogenic material may be used in varying amounts depending on the particular material employed and ultimate desired effect. Prefer red amounts have generally been found to be less than about 5 by weight of the final products and may range from about 0.2 to about 5 by weight. The support structure used in the invention is not critical and may be selected from a wide variety of materials that are compatible with a polyurethane urea formulation. Exemplary support surfaces may be prepared from thermoplastic polyurethanes, thermosetting polyurethanes, vinyl polymers, polyethylene, polypropy lene, polycarbonates, polystyrenes, polytetrafluoro ethylene, polyesters, polyvinyl chlorides and the like. The particular structures do not constitute a critical aspect of this invention other than to serve as a support substrate for the antithrombogenic agent. The supports are preferably preformed into the desired shape or structure for the particular application prior to treatment according to the invention. Of significant importance is the ability of the support to bind the modified polyurethane urea compound with the antithrom bogenic agent in order to effect irreversible coupling. It has been found that any support may be used which has an average molecular weight different from the poly urethane urea compound used to form the coupling complex and which does not dissolve in the organic solvent for the complex. This distinction is critical to enable bonding of performed supports without deformation while permitting a layer of polyurethane coupler to be bonded to the support structure. In this manner, an integral unit is formed which will not easily separate upon use. The first step in the process of the invention involves treating the surface of the solid support with a solution of a protonated amine rich polyurethane urea so that the polyurethane urea material is bonded to the support substrate. The polyurethane urea materials of the invention may be selected from a wide variety of compounds prepared by reacting a polyurethane pre polymer with a diamine. Polyurethane ureas are known in the art. They are generally made by chain extending the reaction product of a diisocyanate and a high molecular weight glycol urethane prepolymer with a diamine. Without being limited there to, one particularly preferred procedure of the present invention involves adding diamine in excess, that is from about 0.6 to 1 mole of diamine and preferably 0.75 to 1 mole for each free isocyanate group in the prepolymer to produce a polyurethane urea with primary amine end groups. Use of ratio s below 0.6 have been found unsuitable to prepare an amine rich polyurethane urea compound to enable sufficient reaction with the antithrombogenic agent. Ratios above about 1.0 result in the presence of nonreactive excess diamine which must be removed from the solution for adequate processing. The urethane prepolymer can be based on a variety of diisocyanates. Suitable diisocyanates include 1,4 cyclohexane diisocyante dicyclohexylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate xylene diisocyanate 1 isocyanate 3 isocyanatomethyl 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexane hexamethyl ene diisocyanate 1,4 dimethylcyclohexyl diisocyanate 2,4,4 trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate isocyanates such as m phenylene diisocyanate mixtures of 2,4 and 2,6 hexamethylene 1,5 diisocyanate hexahydrotolylene diisocyanate and isomers , napthylene 1,5 diisocyanate 1 methoxyphenyl 2, 4 diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate 4,4 biphenylene diisocyanate 3,3 dimethoxy 4,4 biphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3 dimethyl 4,4 biphenyl diisocyanate, and 3,3 dimethyl diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate and mixtures there of. The aliphatic and alicyclic diisocyanates employed in the process of this invention and the products made therefrom generally exhibit good resistance to the degradative effects of ultraviolet light. The high molecular weight glycols useful in the present invention may be a polyether diol or polyester diol and range in number average molecular weight from about 400 to about 3,000 and preferably about 500 to about 2,000. The low molecular weight glycols may also be used to prepare the prepolymer which materials may have from about 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Exemplary of the low molecular weight glycols which may be employed to prepare polyester polypols are 1,6 hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, trimethylolpropane, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 1,2 propanediol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol, 1,6, hexanediol, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The polyethers containing at least 2 hydroxyl groups used in accordance with the invention are also known per se and are obtained, for example, by polymer izing epoxides, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran, styrene oxide or epichlorohydrin on their own, for example, in the presence of BF₃, or by adding these epoxides, option ally in admixture or in succession, to starter compo nents containing reactive hydrogen atoms, such as water, alcohols, or amines, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,3 or 1,2 propylene glycol, 4,4 dihydroxy diphenyl propane, aniline, ammonia, ethanolamine or ethylene diamine. The most preferred polyether diols are poly tetramethylene ether glycols. The use of trihydric alcohols can be employed when branched polymers are desired to improve coating properties. Examples are glycerin, trimethyolpropane, adducts of trimethylolpropane or glycerin with ethylene oxide, or epsilon caprolactone, trimethylolethane, hexanetriol 1,2,6 , butanetriol 1,2,4 and pentaerythritol. Illustrative polyesters may contain hydroxyl groups, for example, reaction products of polyhydric alcohols reacted with divalent carboxylic acids. It is also possible to use the corresponding polycarboxy lic acid anhydrides or corresponding polycarboxylic acid esters of lower alcohols or mixtures thereof, for producing the polyesters. The polycarboxylic acids may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and or hetero cyclic and may optionally be substituted, for example, by halogen atoms and or unsaturated. Examples of poly carboxylic acids of this kind include succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic acid anhydride, tetrachloro phthalic acid anhydride, endomethylene tetrahydro phthalic acid anhydride, glutaric acid anhydride, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride, fumaric acid, dimeric and trimeric fatty acids such as oleic acid, optionally in admixture with monomeric fatty acids, terephthalic acid dimethyl ester and terephthalic acid bis glycol ester. Examples of suitable polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, 1,2 and 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,4 and 2,3 butylene glycol, 1,6 hexanediol, octanediol, neopentyl glycol, cyclohexane dimethanol 1,4 bis hydroxy methyl cyclohexane , 2 methyl 1, 3 propanediol, also diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycols, dibutylene glycol and polybutylene glycols. Polyesters of lactones, for example, ε caprolactone or hydroxy carboxylic acids, for example, The prepolymer is prepared by heating polyols and diisocyanate with agitation in solvent under an inert atmosphere to 60 100 C. The ratio of NCO to hydroxyl OH groups in the prepolymer is from 1.5 to 2 1 with a ratio of 2 1 preferred. The higher NCO to OH ratio limits the molecular weight of the prepolymer and results in higher levels of amine functionality from the diamine reaction later. The diol molecular weight can vary from 400 3000 molecular weight. Molecular weights of about 800 to about 1500 give a combination of good film formation with adequate levels of amine functionality at the end of the reaction sequence. A catalyst may be employed but is not required. The reactants are heated for a period sufficient to react all the hydroxyl groups. The reaction time is generally 2 6 hours, however catalysts may shorten the reaction time to as little as 5 minutes. Suitable catalysts include tin salts such as dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octoate or tertiary amines. The prepolymer reaction is preferably carried out in solvent and in a solvent which is unreactive to NCO. Alternatively, the prepolymer may be formed neat and solvent added afer the prepolymer is formed. Con venient solvents used in preparation of the prepolymer are aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran. Certain solvents have potential reactivity with amines and therefore must be evaporated prior to the addition of amines examples of such solvents include ketones and methylene chloride. A diamine solution is made by dissolving the amine in an appropriate solvent. Isopropanol was selected because the diamine dissolves or disperses readily in it and it is a secondary alcohol with a low probability of competing for available NCO groups with the amine groups. One particularly preferred final solvent mixture of toluene isopropanol 2 1 by wt. has the ability to solvate the highly polar polyurethane urea. In addition to isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert butanol and diacetone alcohol or mixtures of alcohols may also be used. Amines useful for this invention are ethylene diamine, 1,3 propylene diamine, 1 4 butanediamine, 1 6 hexanediamine, 1,7 heptanediamine, 1,8 octane diamine, 1,9 nonanediamine, 1,10 decanediamine, 1,12 dodecanediamine, piperazine, phenylene diamine, tolylene diamine, hydrazine, methylene bis aniline, methylene bis 4 aminocyclohexane, isophorone diamine, 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,6 hexanediamine, menthane diamine, polyoxypropylene diamines and polyoxyethylene diamines known as Jeffamines from Jefferson Chemical Company, U.S.A. The prepolymer solution may be prepared at a con centration of 10 60 , with 30 40 being preferred wt wt . A solution of diamine and solvent such as isopropanol is made with a concentration of 1 30 , with 5 15 being preferred net weight . The prepolymer is slowly added to the diamine solution with good stirring, maintaining the temperature at 30 C, in a nitrogen en vironment. After the reaction solution has been mixed well and the reaction is complete, a preferred optional procedure involves adding an acid slowly to the amine rich polyurethane urea solution. A suficient amount of acid is added to protonate the amine functionality of the amine rich polyurethane urea. The solution concentration is adjusted to an appropriate concentration of 5 50 weight percent, where 10 30 is preferred and 15 25 is most preferred. The preferred acid addition technique used accord ing to the invention prevents premature reaction of the free amine groups with carbon dioxide and other oxidiz ing agents present in the reaction. This is achieved by converting the amine groups into salt radicals by reaction with a protonating acid. Suitable acids in clude acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, citric acid, butyric acid, toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid and so forth. The reaction permits the amine rich polyurethane urea compound to be stored for long periods. It has been unexpectedly found that when this protective step was not employed, a sharp variation in results was evidenced due to variable and often relatively low amounts of anti thrombogenic material bond to the polyurethane. The choice of polyurethane urea solvent for coating the substrate is an important factor. Many combinations of the previously listed solvents could be found useable by a coatings chemists skilled in the use of solubility parameter theory. Although the solvent mixture of toluene and isopropanol has the proper characteristics, many other combinations are useable. Other solvents can be substituted by volatilizing the original reaction solvent and reconstituting to 5 40 by weight where 15 25 is preferred. Exemplary solvents include toluene, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, acetonitrite, and the like. The solvent system is important to the invention but not critical or limiting. Once prepared, the protonated polyurethane urea is dispersed or dissolved in a solvent at the appropri ate concentration of about 5 to about 40 and is contacted to form a layer upon the substrate by conventional flow or dip coating processes. Once contacting is complete, the structure is placed in a gaseous environment, preferably nitrogen, to remove the solvent. The structure is then ready for reaction with the antithrombogenic agent. Prior to reacting the protonated amine group with the antithrombogenic agent it will be necessary to activate the amine function ality on the polyurethane urea. Activation may be conveniently performed with an alkaline buffer. The particular buffer is not critical even though it is preferred that the pH of the buffer be above about 8.0. Suitable buffers include, but are not limited to, sodium borate, sodium 5 5 diethylbarbiturate HCl, Clarks and Lubs solution NaOH, KCl and H₃BO₃ , and sodium bicarbonate. It is essential according to the invention that the antithrombogenic agent be modified to contain a reactive aldehyde moiety which does not inhibit the bioactivity of the antithrombogenic agent when coupling is complete. The formation of aldehyde containing agents may be achieved by conventional methods. For example when using heparin as the antithrombogenic agent, heparin may be partially depolymerized by deaminative cleavage with aldehyde inducing compounds such as sodium perio date and nitrous acid. This cleavage converts an amine bearing carbohydrate residue to a 2,5 anhydro D mannose residue. One preferred method to produce an aldehyde modified heparin involves the reaction of sodium heparinate with sodium periodate at a pH of between 3 7 with a preferred range of 4 5. The pH of the reaction mixture is maintained by an appropriate buffer. The reaction is carried out with the reaction vessel pro tected from light with constant stirring. Upon comple tion of the reaction, an excess of glycerin is added to neutralize the remaining unreacted periodate. The aldehyde modified heparin is then optionally dried in a nitrogen environment. The dried aldehyde modified heparin may then be simply reconstituted in an appropriate acidic buffer of pH 3.0 8.0 where 4 7 is preferred and a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride is added at weight percent of 1 40 , where 5 30 is preferred, and 5 15 most preferred. This solution is then exposed to the amine rich polyurethane urea coated substrate. The aldehyde functional groups on the heparin are then reacted with the free amine groups to give a Schiff base formation that may be reduced to provide stable secondary amines. Exemplary reducing agents include sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, and tetrahydrofuran borane. This reaction results in covalently bonding of the antithrombogenic agent to the polyurethane urea. Upon completion of the antithrombogenic coupling reaction, the surface may be washed with water to remove loosely bound or unreacted antithrombogenic agent. Washing may be optionally performed with an isotonic solution. The resulting covalently bonded heparin demonstrates high antithrombogenic activity as well as permanency and nonleachability. The invention will be further illustrated by the following nonlimiting examples. All parts and percentages given throughout the Specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated. This example illustrates the synthesis of a prefer red amine rich polyurethane urea. 29.61g of trimethylolpropane and 215.14g of a low molecular weight polyether polyol such as Teracol 650 poly oxytetramethylene glycol were added together in a mixing vessel 1.0 equivalent of each and heated at 70 C. After equilibrating, 346.90g 4.0 equivalents of hydrogenated diphenyl methylene diisocyanate was added and mixing continued. 0.09g of dibutyl tin dilaurate 0.015 was added to the mixing solution. After at least 5 minutes of mixing the reactants were transferred to a 90 C oven for 60 minutes. After one hour the prepolymer was removed and the percent free NCO groups was titrated and calculated. Typical values ranged from 8.0 9.5 . The prepolymer was then purged with nitrogen gas and stored. 60g of the previously prepared prepolymer with NCO content of 8.46 was added to 120g of toluene to make a 33 wt wt solution. A diamine solution was prepared by adding 14.72g of 1,6 hexanediamine to 80g of isopropanol and 40g of toluene. The diamine solution was stirred vigorously with a magnetic stir bar. The prepolymer solution was then added dropwise to the diamine solution over a two hour period. The reaction was stirred for an additional two hours. Glacial acetic acid 10g was then added dropwise to the reaction mixture. The resulting amine rich poly urethane urea polymer was then dried with nitrogen gas and finally with vacuum. The amine rich poly urethane urea polymer was then dissolved in methanol to a 20 wt wt solution for coating. This example demonstrates the preparation of an aldehyde modified heparin. Heparin 1.0g was added to a sodium acetate buffer which was prepared by dissolving 0.5g of sodium acetate in 300 ml distilled water. The pH of this solution was then adjusted to 4.5 with glacial acetic acid. 0.1g of sodium periodate NaIO₄ was added and the solution was reacted for 20 minutes in a light protected reaction vessel with constant stirring. Thereafter, 3.0g of glycerol was added to neutralize any remaining periodate. The solution was concentrated by drying under nitrogen gas. The final solution was reconstituted to 1 wt wt. This example is illustrative of the preparation of an antithrombogenic surface according to the present invention. An amine rich polyurethane urea polymer of Example 1 was dissolved in methanol to a 20 wt wt solution. A polyurethane substrate was coated with the amine rich polyurethane urea. After coating, the substrate was placed in nitrogen atmosphere for 60 minutes at ambient temperature. The samples were then placed in sodium borate buffer of pH 9.2, which was prepared by dissolving 57.21g of sodium borate in 15 liters of distilled water, and stored until reaction with heparin. The samples were then placed in a mixing vessel and aldehyde modified heparin of Example 2 was added to a concentration of 1 . The reaction was performed in a pH 4.5 sodium acetate buffer at 50 C. Sodium cyano borohydride 0.05g was added as a reducing agent. After 2 hours the samples were removed and placed in a 3M saline solution to remove any loosely bound or adsorbed heparin. Initial radiolabel assays showed that 117.2ug 3.4ug of heparin was bound per cm² of surface area. After 384 hours washing in a dynamic 3M saline solution, essentially no heparin was leached or lost. The radiolabel assay showed 112.5ug 6ug of heparin was still bound per cm². This demonstrates the permanency of the covalent bonded heparin of this invention. Various length diamines can be used in the synthesis of the amine rich polyurethane urea. This example demonstrates the use of an eight carbon diamine. 29.61g of trimethylolpropane and 215.14g of a low molecular weight polyether polyol such as Teracol 650 poly oxytetramethylene glycol were added together in a mixing vessel 1.0 equivalent of each and heated at 70 C. Thereafter, 346.90g 4.0 equivalents of hydrogenated diphenyl methylene diisocyanate was added. 0.09g of dibutyl tin dilaurate, a catalyst, 0.015 was added to the mixing solution. After at least 5 minutes of mixing the reactants were transferred to a 90 C oven for 60 minutes. After one hour the prepoly mer was removed and the percent free NCO groups were titrated and calculated. Typical values ranged from 8.0 9.5 . The prepolymer was then purged with nitrogen gas and stored. 15g of the previously prepared prepolymer with NCO content of 8.16 was added to 30g of toluene to make a 33 wt wt solution. A diamine solution was prepared by adding 5.09g of 1.8 octanediamine to 45g of 2 1 isopropanol toluene by wt. solvent mixture. The diamine solution was stirred vigorously with a magnetic stir bar. The prepolymer solution was then added drop wise to the diamine solution over a two hour period. The reaction was stirred for an additional two hours. 2.23g of glacial acetic acid was then added dropwise. The resulting amine rich polyurethane urea was then dried with nitrogen gas and finally with vacuum. The amine rich polyurethane urea polymer was then dissolved in propanol to a 15 wt wt solution for coating. This example demonstrates the effectiveness of the present invention in using longer chain diamines in the amine rich polyurethane urea and the subsequent bonding of antithrombogenic agents. An amine rich polyurethane urea polymer of Example 4 was dissolved in propanol to a 15 wt wt solution. A polyurethane substrate was coated with the amine rich polyurethane urea. After coating, the sub strate was placed in a nitrogen atmosphere for 60 minutes at ambient temperature. The samples were then placed in sodium borate buffer of pH 9.2 and stored until reaction with heparin. The samples were then placed in a mixing vessel and aldehyde modified heparin, similar to that of Example 2, was added to a concentration of 1 . The reaction was performed in a pH 4.5 sodium acetate buffer at 50 C. Sodium cyanoborohydride 0.05g was added as a reducing agent. After 2 hours the samples were removed and placed in a 3M saline solution to remove any loosely bound or adsorbed heparin. Initial radiolabel assays showed that 113.6ug 8.2ug of heparin was bound per cm² of surface area. After 24 hours in a dynamic water wash, the radiolabel assay showed 90.7ug 4.9ug of heparin was still bound per cm². This demonstrates the permanency of the covalent bounded heparin of this invention. The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit of scope of the invention and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the claims.
