# Audio frequency power amplifier.

## Abstract
A bridged transformerless power amplifier comprises main 10, 12 and inverse 18, 20 amplifier units having the same structure but producing outputs which are inverted rela tive to each other. A low impedance load 28 is directly con nected between the output ports of the main and inverse am plifier units. A first operation control ciruit SW0, SW3, SW4 activates only the main amplifier unit after the power switch is turned on, and a second operation control circuit SW5 main tains the output port of the inverse amplifier unit in a floating state for a predetermined period of time after the activation of the main amplifier unit has begun. Hence the power amplifier produces no pop noise when the power supply is switched on.
