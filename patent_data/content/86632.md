# CONTROL VALVE

## Abstract
A control valve 1 for an hydraulic piston cylinder assem bly 28 having one port 10 connected to the cylinder 27 and another port 11 connectable into a circuit which controls relative movement between the cylinder 27 and piston 30 . The two ports 10, 11 communicate through the body 2 of the valve 1 and a closure member 4 is movable between positions at which it opens ans closes that communication. A striker 21 associated with the piston cylinder assembly 28 and responsive to relative movement thereof in one direction, is engagable with an abutment 22 of the closure member 4 so as to move that member 4 towards the valve closed posi tion. As the closure member 4 approaches the closed posi tion, a throttling portion 19 of that member 4 becomes op erative to restrict fluid flow between the valve ports 10, 11 and thereby creates a pressure differential which acts across the closure member 4 to move that member 4 free of the influence of the striker 21 and into tne closed position. When the throttling portion 19 is inoperative, fluid pressure within the valve 1 tends to urge the closure member 4 towards the open position.
