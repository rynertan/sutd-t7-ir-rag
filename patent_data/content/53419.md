# A spreader.

## Abstract
A spreader for granular and or powdery material such as fertilizer comprises a hopper 2 having two delivery parts 41, 42 . Distribution members 3, 4 are provided beneath the delivery parts 41, 42 for broad casting material fed to them from the hopper 2 . The distribution members 3, 4 are mounted on a carrier 70 which is coupled to the hopper 2 . This construc tion results in a constant position of the distribution members 3, 4 with respect to the delivery parts 41, 42 , regardless of deflections which may occur as a result of the weight of material in the hopper. The distribution members 3, 4 may be driven by a mechanical transmission from a power take off shaft of a tractor, or by a hydraulic motor.
