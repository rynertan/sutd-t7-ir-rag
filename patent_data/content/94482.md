# Fabrication process for a shallow emitter, narrow intrinsic base transistor.

## Abstract
A high performance bipolar transistor having a shallow emitter and a narrow intrinsic base region is fabricated by a minimum number of process steps. A silicon semiconductor body 10 is provided with regions of monocrystalline silicon isolated from one another by isolation regions 18 an epitaxial layer 14 and a buried subcollector 12 . A layer 24 of polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the body. The surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer 24 is oxidized and the polycrystalline silicon is implanted with a base impurity. Silicon nitride and oxide layers 28, 30 are deposited on the polysilicon layer. An opening is made in the surface oxide layer 28 and the silicon nitride layer 30 to define the emitter area of the transistor. The polycrystalline silicon is thermally oxidized to drive the base impurity into the substrate. The thermal oxide is removed in an isotropic etch to leave an oxide sidewall cover 38 on the polycrystalline silicon. An emitter impurity is ion implanted into the polycrystalline silicon in the emitter area and then driven into the substrate. Collector, base and emitter contact openings are made and conductive metallurgy is formed.
