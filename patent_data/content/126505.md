# Aqueous enzyme containing compositions with improved stability.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to aqueous, enzymatic liquid deter gent compositions which contain an enzyme stabilizing system. The replacement of polyols in known enzyme stabilizing systems on the basis of mixtures of a polyol with a boron compound, such as boric acid or borax, or with a reducing salt, such as sodium sulphite, by a dicarboxylic acid, such as succinic acid, also provides for an effective, often superior enzymestabilizing system.
