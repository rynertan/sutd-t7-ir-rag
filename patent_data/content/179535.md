## Description
Hollow or compressible conical sealing member. The invention relates to a hollow or compressible sealing member which is entirely or for the greater part in the form of a cone and which, for example, can be used both in compressible and non compressible holders for liquids or solids. Liquids and solids which are attacked and or will deteriorate in quality when exposed to air or by light cannot be stored and used in holders without the use of a sealing system. The sealing systems known so far cannot be used in practice to make holders suitable for such applications because they build up too much resistance, or are too complicated or too expensive for use on a large scale. A simple sealing system has now been found which is suitable indeed for use in articles which are manufactured in large numbers, for example, compressible or non compressible holders for liquid and or solids. The sealing member according to the invention consists of a thin flexible material and has entirely or for the greater part the shape of a hollow cone as is shown inFigures 1 to 4. The sealing member operates as a non return valve. The circumference of the open end the base plane of the cone should correspond accurately to the inner circumference of the pouring opening of the holder to be sealed by means of the valve. The circumference of the base plane of the cone is partly connected to the inner wall of the pouring opening. The pressure build up caused by the valve depends on the thickness and flexibility of the material from which the valve is manufactured.All this depends on the contemplated use of the valve. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which a few application possibilities of the valve according to the invention are also given without restricting the invention thereto. keterence numeral 20 in figure I aenotes the pouring neck of a comMresslDle holder. Non return valve 10 accor oiny to the invention is mounted in the neck 2u. This mayLe aone, for example, by connecting a part of the outer eaye of the base plane or the hollow cone and optionally of the outside of the cone itself to tne inner side of the neck 0 to be seaiea, for example, by means of a part of a spring ring which clamps a part of the base plane in a circumferential recess in the pouring neck.An optimum sealing is obtained by constructing the recess so as to be conical, preferably in such manner that the lower edge of said recess extenas parallel to the oblique side of the cone. In order to get the contents entirely or partly out of the holoer, the contents are poured or sprayed in a receptacle by squeezing the holder 30. As soon as the pressure in the space 11 below the valve becomes so much larger than in space 12 above the valve that the valve resistance can be overcome, the valve 10 opens in that the part LI ot the cone not connectea to the neck 20 is pushed asiae see Figure 2 .The valve closes immediately depenaent on the resistance of the valve material when the pressure in 11 ana 12 becomes equal so that no ambient air is arawn in ana the contents of the holaer are not attackea. In this manner the holder can be emptied by squeezing like a tube. Figures 3 ana 4 show a modified embodiment of the non return valve shown in Figures 1 and 2. In this embodiment the pouring neck 20 comprises a member with which the valve can be opened from without and in this manner gets the function of a cock. This can be done in a way known per se, for example, by means of a compression spring pin is wnich comprises a pressure plate at the ena near the valve. Another application possibility of the valve in accornance with the invention is that a so called aispenser can be obtained by using a combination of two valves in the same holder. ihis can be achievea by mounting one valve in the above aescribea manner in the pouring neck, and provi aing a secona valve which operates oppositely to the first in a separate air arawing in tube beside the pouring neck. ken the pouring neck is proviaeo with a graduation, a measurea quantity Of the contents can be collected in the neck by squeezing the holder and be drained by turning the holder upside down. Via the secona valve an equal volume ot, optionally fiiter or aries, air is drawn in. By a correct choice ana dimensions or the material the resistance ot the first valve may be so large that when the holder is turned upside aown the contents cannot leave the holder via this valve. by means of an above aescribed compression spring pin 22, an excess, if any, can be made to flow back into the holder. Another modified embodiment of the Figures 1 and 2 valve is shown in Figures 5 and 6. This embodiment may be used in holoers which cannot be compressed, for example, giass holaers. Since the pressure below the non return valve cannot be made larger than above the valve by squeezing such a holder, the valve shown in Figures 1 to 4 coula not operate. The modified embodiment shown in Figures 5 ana 6 is suitable indeea for such an application.In this emboaiment the hollow conical non return valve 10 has the shape of half a cone. The other half 40 of the pouring neck 20 is now constructed so that air can be arawn in so as to enable pouring of the contents. By providing the said drawing in aperture of neck 20 with suitable filtering material 41, contamination of the contents in holaer 30 by the drawn in air can be prevented.Of course, the choice of the filtering material 41 depends on the ena in view, for example, filtering the CO2 or h20 present in the drawn in air. The bent tube in the drawing in part 40 of neck 20 and space 44 below the filter holaer 43 serve as buffer spaces ana prevent the filtering material from contacting the contents. tube 42 is bent so that the opening aoes not come below the level of the contents when the holder du riny pouring is kept in an inclinea pOSition and the arawn in air need not overcome any resistance. The valve according to the invention may also be used in hollers for low boiling point liquids which at room temperature have a considerable vapour pressure, for example, ether, or buila up a vapour pressure by decomposition, for example, hydrogen peroxide. Holders with such liquids comprising the conical non return valve according to the invention can be store without any danger. hhen the vapour pressure in the holder exceeds a certain value, a quantity of vapour is trained via the valve. The over pressure at which this happens, i.e. at which the valve opens, depends on the material ana or thickness from which the valve is manufactured. The valve operates as a safety valve. In order to enable pouring, the holder should comprise a cock which can be opened and close for drawing in air. Further modifications of the valve are possible to enlarge the resistance ana or improve the mounting of the valve. For this purpose for example the base plane of the valve may comprise a cylinorical sleeve, which circumference should correspona accurately to the inner circumference of the opening to be sealed. Further the conical valve may also be not or not completely hollow. It may be constructed of or filled up with a compressible material. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the valve accoraing to the invention can in general be used in all cases in which a non return valve system is requires, for example in balloons, air mattresses, skipperballs ana so on.
