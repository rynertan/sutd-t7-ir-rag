## Description
The invention relates to polymeric compositions derived from poly arylcyclobutene monomers and to a process for preparing said polymeric compositions. The polymeric compositions of this invention are useful in films, as molded articles, in coatings, as adhesives, and in composites. The article in the Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communication, 1979, pages 207 208 discloses that the preparation and pyrolysis of 1,2 bis 1,2 dihydrobenzocyclobutene 4yl ethane in the gas phase in a flow system at 600 C and 10 ³ Torr followed by collection of the exit gases at 30 C gave a white solid which, after purification is identified as 2.2.2 1,2.4 cyclophane. In recent years the search for high performance materials, especially high temperature resistance polymers, has gained momentum. In order for a material to be useful at high temperatures, it must fulfill several requirements including a high melting or softening temperature, a high modulus or rigidity at elevated temperature, a resistance to solvent and chemical degradation, and toughness. The intrinsic thermal and oxidative stability of aromatic structures has long been recognized, and a variety of polymers have been made in which benzene rings are linked together by various connecting groups. Among the more stable aromatic polymers that fulfill the requirements of high temperature resistance are the polybenzimidazoles, the polybenzoxazoles, polyimides, and some polyamides, such as the polyaramides. Of these polymers, the polyimides have had the most interest. The major difficulty encountered in the commercial development of these materials is that they are usually obtained in the form of a powder which cannot be readily fabricated into useful objects. The polyimides prepared from aliphatic diamines and aromatic dianhydrides are generally soluble and thermoplastic. Aliphatic polyimides have been prepared from bis dienophiles and a diene such as a bis diene. In many cases, such reactions proceed with the evolution of gases and other volatile components. Aromatic polyimides, such as polypyromellitimides, have a spectrum of superior properties. These polyimides may be prepared by the reaction of an aromatic dianhydride with an aromatic diamine to give a soluble polyamic acid, which on cyclodehydration gives the insoluble desired product. High performance plastics reduce the weight of mechanical components, and not just by virtue of their densities. Their high performance properties allow greater design stresses, and often elements can be downsized accordingly. In recent years, aromatic polyimides have become widely accepted as premium, high performance engineering plastics. These resins are well known for having excellent properties at elevated temperatures i.e., chemical resistance and mechanical strength but are also costly. Historically, polyimide resins are difficult to fabricate into objects other than fibers and films. The most common methods of manufacturing parts having high strength and temperature properties are hot compression molding, machining from hot compression, and molded or extruded rod . Given the synthetic and fabrication difficulties, a new route to polyimides and other high performance plastics is desirable. Many thermally polymerizable compounds are prepared from monomers which have a poor shelf life and are unstable in the presence of oxygen or oxygen containing gases. Further, many processes for the polymerization of thermally polymerizable compounds result in the generation of volatile components, which can create problems in the product such as the creation of voids in molded articles. Further, the removal of such volatile by products can create problems. Also, many of such polymerization processes require the use of curing agents, initiators or catalysts. The use of such curing agents, initiators or catalysts often results in polymers which contain impurities which may effect the final properties. Polymers which polymerize through thermal mechanisms wherein such mechanisms which do not require the use of catalysts, initiators or curing agents and which do not form volatile by products, are needed. Polymers derived from monomers which polymerize by thermal mechanisms, wherein such monomers have a good stability, shelf life, and are stable in the presence of oxygen, are desirable. Polymers formed by thermal polymerization mechanisms, with a good modulus, which are thermally stable, which have low water pickup, are reasonably hard and are insoluble, are needed. It is an object of the present invention to provide a polymeric composition comprising the reaction product obtainable by the process of exposing one or more poly arylcyclobutene monomers to a temperature at which the poly arylcyclobutene monomer undergoes polymerization. This object is solved by a poly arylcyclobutene monomer which corresponds to the formula wherein Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a polymeric composition comprising the reaction product prepared by exposing one or more poly arylcyclobutene monomers to a temperature at which the poly arylcyclobutene monomer undergoes polymerization, characterized in that said poly arylcyclobutene monomer processed therein corresponds to the formula wherein Thus, the novel polymeric compositions can be prepared by heating the monomers to a temperature at which such monomers polymerize. These monomers upon heating to the appropriate temperature undergo a polymerization in which no volatiles are generated, wherein there is not need for a catalyst, curing agent or initiator. The monomers these polymeric compositions are prepared from have a surprisingly good shelf life and stability to oxygen containing gases. The polymeric compositions have a good modulus, are thermally stable, have a low water pickup, are reasonably hard and insoluble.

In general, the metal hydroxide is reacted with the number of moles of carboxylate substituted arylcyclobutenes equal to the metal s coordination number. A poly arylcyclobutene with a polyvalent metal bridging member is prepared by first reacting one equivalent of a bromine substituted arylcyclobutene with one equivalent of magnesium in an ether solvent to prepare an arylcyclobutenyl magnesium bromide. To prepare a di arylcyclobutenyl magnesium, one equivalent of a brominated arylcyclobutene is reacted with two equivalents of magnesium. The arylcyclobutenyl magnesium bromide is reacted with a metal chloride to prepare a poly arylcyclobutenyl metal. The metal chloride is reacted with the number of equivalents of arylcyclobutenyl magnesium bromide equal to the metal s oxidation state.

In general, the polymeric compositions of this invention are prepared by contacting one or more of the poly arylcyclobutene compounds and heating them to the polymerization temperature of the particular monomer s used. The polymerization is an addition polymerization wherein no volatiles are generated. Furthermore, no catalyst initiator or curing agents are necessary for the polymerization to take place. It is believed that the polymerization takes place when the cyclobutene ring undergoes transformation to prepare a molecule containing a 1,3 cyclohexadienyl radical with two exo olefinic unsaturated moieties adjacent to one another wherein each of the olefinic unsaturated moieties undergoes reaction with the olefinic unsaturated moieties of other 1,3 cyclohexadienyl containing molecules which have undergone the same transformation. The temperature at which the poly arylcyclobutene monomers undergo polymerization is affected by the nature of any substituent on the cyclobutene ring. In some embodiments, the temperature of polymerization is as low as about 30 C. In preferred embodiments, the temperature at which polymerization is initiated is above 150 C, more preferably above 200 C. It is to be noted that the temperature at which polymerization is initiated is dependent upon the nature of substituents on the cyclobutene ring. In general, wherein the cyclobutene ring is unsubstituted, the polymerization is initiated at about 200 C. Wherein the cyclobutene ring is substituted with an electron donating substituent, the polymerization temperature is generally lowered, the higher the ability of the substituent to donate electrons, the lower the polymerization initiation temperature is. Conversely, the electron with drawing substituents on the cyclobutene ring result in higher polymerization initiation temperatures. The unsubstituted cyclobutene in general polymerizes at the highest temperature. It is believed the polymers prepared from the poly arylcyclobutenes comprise units corresponding to the formulas and or mixtures thereof. It is believed that the preferred polymers prepared from the poly arylcyclobutenes comprise mixtures of formulas A and B. In those embodiments wherein Ar is benzene, it is believed that the polymer s prepared from poly benzocyclobutenes comprise units corresponding to the formulas and or mixtures thereof. It is believed the preferred polymers prepared comprise mixtures of formulas C and D with D being predominant.

The methylene chloride is removed via rotary evaporation and the resultant off white solid is recrystallized from 600 ml of acetone. The first crop of white crystals is removed from solution via filtration and the solution remaining is concentrated to 250 ml and again recrystallized. The second crop of crystals is also isolated via filtration and the remaining solvent is removed to leave a light brown residue. Final weights and purity by HPLC are as follows first crop, 42.10 g, 99.8 percent second crop, 6.07 g, 99.3 percent residue, 6.6 g. Yield is 88 percent of theoretical. The monomer is devolatilized at 100 C and 0.5 mm Hg vacuum for two hours, cooled and the vacuum is backlet with nitrogen. The devolatilized monomer 0.5 g is then transferred to a test tube with a ground glass joint, and equipped with a gas inlet tube topped with T and mineral oil bubbler for nitrogen blanket. The test tube is then placed in a Woods metal bath at 100 C and slowly taken up to 250 C. The temperature of the Woods metal bath is held at between 245 C 250 C for 90 minutes. At the end of this time the test tube is removed from the bath and allowed to cool, still under nitrogen blanket. When cool to the touch, the gas inlet tube is removed and the polymer that remains in the tube is examined. The piece is light yellow in color, contains some voids, and cannot be fractured with a spatula to remove it from the tube. The following monomers are tested according to the procedures of Example 1. The results are compiled in Table III.
