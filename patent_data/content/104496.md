# Electron emitter assembly.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is an electron emitter assembly for an electron gun which includes a first emitter ring, a second emitter ring, a power supply, connectors for connecting the power supply to the two electron emitter rings so that heating current flows from the power supply through the rings, and said rings being mounted so that a magnetic field formed by the second ring counteracts the magnetic field formed by the first ring.
