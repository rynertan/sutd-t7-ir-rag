# FERROUS SULFIDE DISSOLUTION IN ACID WITH LOWERED GAS FORMATION

## Abstract
In the treatment of ferrous sulfide scale on ferrous metal surfaces by contacting the surface with an aqueous acid composition the amount of hydrogen sulfide evolved is reduced by including in the composition maleic acid, maleic anhydride, or an alkali metal or ammonium salt of maleic acid, preferably in an amount of from 0.1 to 35 by weight.
