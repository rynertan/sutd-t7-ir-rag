# CONTROL MODULE FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Abstract
A control module for controlling lighting loads and other loads in response to data input from local switches, local sen sors and or a remote central controller. The module utilizes a microcomputer having an output which sets the gain of a varia ble gain amplifier. The amplifier provides a periodic waveform of controlled amplitude to each load, to set the energy con sumption output of the load. A data bus connects local switches to an interface for providing local control information to the microcomputer, while another data bus is dedicated to bidirectional communication with a remote central controller, if used. The control module in cludes circuitry for allowing a unique local address to be set for a particular control module, to which unique address the con trol module responds when a plurality of such control modules are connected on a common data bus to a central controller. An additional data bus connects local environmental sensors, such as photocells, thermistors and the like, through analog to digital conversion circuitry to the microcomputer, to facilita te control of the local loads in response to local ambient condi tions. The maximum level of the load s connected to a control module may be programmably established by local controls or by a remote central controller such that this maximum level cannot be exceeded by routine local and or remote com mands, until the maximum level is altered.
