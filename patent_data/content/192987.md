## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THERMICALLY STABLE OLEFINIC POLYMERSThe present invention relates to a process for carrying out the thermal stabilization of olefinic polymers and, in particular, of polypropylene, polyethylene and elastomeric copolymers of propylene with ethylene optionally containing diene monomers, directly in polymerization phase.Attemps in this way have been made in the past, using the most usual thermal stabilizing agents. According to U.S.patent 3.477.991 alkylphenols are added to the polymerization mixture, carried out by means of TiCl3 and Al alkyls, to achieve a polymer already thermically stabilized. According to European patent application 3836, the stabilization of polyethylene, produced by means of chromium catalysts, is obtained by addition during polymerization of antioxidizers of phenolic typeThe direct stabilization during polymerization is of par ticul a r interest in the case of the recent processes for the production of polyolefines by means of high yield catalysts which can be marketed without granulation, and therefore they cannot be stabilized by means of the usual methods that just foresee a granulation stage.The use of compounds of phenolic type in the propylene polymerization by means of supported stereospecific catalysts does not lead, however, to satisfactory results as either it has a negative influence on the catalyst performances and causes a yellowing of the catalyst or it gives rise to un desired effects on the polymer morphology.The yellowing due to some phenolic compunds occurs also when the product is dried from the slurry at the end of the polymerizationNow the applicant has found surprisingly that Qlefinic polymers, for instance polypropylene, polyethylene,and elastomeric copolymers propylene ethylene diene , can be obtained already in the stabilized state, without incurring the typical drawbacks caused by the phenolic compounds by using as stabilizing agents to be added either at the start or during or in the final phase of the polymerization, for instance into the polymerization slurry, before the monomer separation , one or more compounds containing in the molecule one or more steric hindered piperidinic groups having the following general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1,R2 may be alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or rings of 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine or together they can form with the piperidinic carbon atom they are bound to a cycloalkyl group containing from 5 to 10 carbon atoms.R3,R4 alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 18 carbon atoms or together they form with the piperidinic carbon atom they are bound to a cycloalkylic group con taining from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, R5.R6,R7jR8,Rg,Z hydrogen or an organic radical pre ferably a C1 C18 alkyl, C3 C12 alkenyl, C7 C18 aralkyl radical.Compounds containing in the molecule groups having aforesaid formula I utilizable for the purpose of the present invention can be A oligomeric products, that may be represented by one of the following general formulas EMI3.1 EMI4.1 n a whole number ranging between 2 and 100,R1, R2, R3, R4 Z have the meaning as defined for structure I ,R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 have the same meaning as in formula I ,X a bivalent organic radical, preferably an alkylene ra radical containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a group containing one or more ester or amidic function,W a direct chemical bond or a bivalent organic radical, preferably a C1 C1z alkylene radical, N R radical wherein R H or a C1 C18 alkyl radical , or 0Y a direct chemical bond or a bivalent organic radical of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic type, containing N or 0, S, P atoms in the chain or in the heterocyclic ringThe compounds of formula II are known from U.S.patent 4104248,EMI4.2 wherein n, X, Y, R1, R2,R3, R4,R5,R6 , R7, R8, Rg have the meanings as defined for structures II and III .

Preferred compounds of general formula VIII present formulas of type EMI23.2 wherein R1 hydrogen, or a C1 C18 alkyl radical, or a monovalent organic radical, for instance a substituted piperidinic group.R2 hydrogen, a C1 C18 alkyl radical or another monovalent organic radical, for instance CH2 n Y wherein n a whole number comprised between 1 and 12, Y a OH or OR group or aEMI23.3 group, wherein R a C1 C18 alkyl radical R a C1 C2 alkyl radical.As mentioned above, the compounds belonging to classes A and B described herein before, may be used for the purposes of the present invention, by addition to the polymer slurry, before the drying of the same, or, and preferably, before or during the polymerization of the olefinic monomer or monomers, carried out by means of catalysts prepared by reaction of an Al alkyl compound with a solid component selected from a product comprising a Titan us compound and a magnesium halide, and a product formed by a tetravalent titanium compound which is supported onto a trivalent titanium halide having a surface area greater than 50 m2 g.In particular said polymerization is carried out by means of stereospecific catalysts for the polymerization of alphaolefins and comprising the reaction product of an Al alkyl compound with catalytic components comprising a Ti compound, in particular TiC14, and an electron donor compound, supported on a Mg halide in the active form.Mg halide in the active form is characterized by a X ray spectrum wherein the reflections of highest intensity, which appear in the halide spectrum of usual type are replaced by halos.Catalysts of such type are described in U.S. patents No. 4.07 413, 4.107.414, 4.226.741 and 4.298.718.Peculiar characteristics of the supported catalysts, endowed with higher stereospecifity and activity in the alpha olefins polymerization is the one to be prepared with methods which lead to the formation of components comprising the Ti compound on magnesium halide, which do not contain or contain,only in small percentages, Ti compounds heat extractabIe by means of hot heptane and of TiC 14. The perparation of these catalysts IS generally carried out under conditions in which the solid comprising the magnesium halide in the active form is reacted in suspension in theTi compound the excess of Ti compound is then removed by filtration at temperatures at which no Ti compound, extractable by means of hot heptane and of TiC14 at 800 C, remains on the solid then the solid is washed repeatedly with hydrocarbonic solvents in order to remove any trace of soluble compound of Ti.According to other methods, Mg halide, electron donor compound and Ti compound optionally in the presence of coadjuvant agents for the grinding are co pulverized till magnesium halide is activated, namely till, in the x ray spectrum of Mg halide, halos appeared in place of the lines of highest intensity appearing in the spectrum of magnesium halide of usual type.The solid is then subjected to a heat treatment with a hydrocarbonic solution of a halogenated hydrocarbonic compound and the liquid phase is separated by heat filtration in order to remove the soluble compounds. Finally the solid is further washed with an aliphatic hydrocarbon.Examples of these methods are described in European patent applications No. 004789 and No.0004791. According to another method described in U.S.patent No.4.146.502, the solid catalytic component obtained by cogrinding both of a Mg halide and of an electron donor compound and by subsequent treatment with an excess of Tics4 under heat is further treated in suspension in a halogenated hydro carbonic solvent separated from the liquid phase and finally washed repeatedly with a hydrocarbonic solvent.By carrying out the addition of the aforesaid piperidinic compounds during the polymerization and in the case of a polymerization carried out in a discontinuous way, the stabilizing agent can be introduced into the reactor before or together with the components of the catalytic system or successively when the polymerization has already started.In the continuous systems it can be fed into the reactor together with the catalyst or separately. In the case of more reactors in series it can be fed into any one of them.Therefore object of the present invention is a process for preparing olefinic polymers thermically stable consisting in adding into the polymerization medium of the monomers befog during or after the polymerization or to the polymer before the drying of same or before the removal of the monomer, one or more compounds containing at least a piperidinic group steric hindered. The amount of compound that may be added either into the polymerization medium or, alternatively, to the polymer before the drying of same ranges between 0,01 and 1 by weight referred to the polymer and preferably between 0,05 and 0,5g. The olefine polymers to which the process of the present invention is applied comprise crystalline homo and copolymers such as the linear high and low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene and amorphous polymers such as the elastomeric ethylene propylene copolymers, possibly containing diene monomers. In particular, the process is applied to isotactic, or prevailingly, isotactic polypropylene, to the crystalline propylene ethylene copolymers containing prevailingly amounts of propylene and further to high impact polypropylene. The following examples will illustrate the invention without limiting it. Examples 1 6 relate to the use of the catalytic system pre pared according to the process described in example 3 of Italian patent No.1054410 and purpose to show the effective ness of the different piperidinic compounds used as stabilizing agents. Examples 7 9 have the same aim but they relate to the catalytic system prepared according to the process described in examples 30 34 of issued European patent application No.45977.Example 10 shows that the stabilizing agent can be fed together with the catalyst in the preceding examples on the contrary it is fed when the polymerization is half way .Examples 11 12 and 13 show the negative effect on the isotacticity index of the polymer when the usual catalytic system is used,based on TiCl3 DEAC.Examples 14 16 exhibit the drawbacks due to the phenolic stabilizing agents. Example 17 is useful for comparing by using the same additive the stabilization carried out according to the invention and according to the traditional method.Examples 18 21 relate to the preparation of copolymers of ethylene with propylene and butene 1 , respectively, in the presence or absence of the stabilizing agents according to the present invention.

One obtained polymers free from colouring and endowed with a high thermal stability whereas the catalyst performances did not turn out to be damaged.EXAMPLE 10One worked as in examples 2 6 with the difference that the stabilizing agent was introduced into the autclave together with the catalyst. From the comparison with example 2 one deduced that such modification did not change the final result.EXAMPLE 11 of comparison One worked as in example 1 using, however, as activated catalyst TiCl3. 133 All13 and 10 mmoles of AlEt2Cl as co catalyst.A polymer was obtained wholly free from thermal stability.EXAMPLES 12 13One worked as in example 11 with the difference that the stabilizing agent in the amount indicated on the Table was introduced into the autoclave together with the catalyst.From the comparison with example 11 one remarked that with this catalytic system the addition of the stabilizing agent lowers in an unacceptable degree the isotacticity index of the polymer.EXAMPLES 14 16One worked as in examples 2 6 while using, however, the stabilizing agents of phenolic type as indicated on the Table. The obtained results showed that such stabilizing agents although they had been added in a lower amount with respect to the piperidinic ones steric hindered either they interferred on the catalytic performances ex.14 or Imparted an undesired colouring to the polymer vex.15 and 16 and therefore they could not be used for the desired purpose.EXAMPLE 17 of reference The example relates to a polymer stabilized with the traditional method, namely by adding the additive during the granulation stage.By comparing examples 2,8 and 10 with example 17 we were able to conclude that a stabilization carried out with the process object of the present invention gave a result at least equal to the one carried out with the traditIonal method.EXAMPLE 58 comparative test into a stainless steel autoclave having a capacity of 2.5 l equipped with a stirrer and a thermoregulating device there was introduced at room temperature and in an isobutane stream a catalytic mixture consisting of 0,6 g of Et 3Al and of 8,8 mg of a catalyst prepared according to example 5 ofItalian Patent No.1,078,995 along with 20 ml of hexane.350 g of isobutane were then introduced and the temperature was quickly brought to 65 C.H2 was added up to a pressure of 12.5 kg cmê gauge, then 300 g of butene 1 were added and at last the total pressure was brought to 25 kg cmê gauge with ethylene.The autoclave was miantained at 65 C and 25 kg cmê gauge during two hours by continuously replenishing the consumed ethylene and butene 1.After 2 hours, stirring was stopped and the monomer mixture as well as the solvent were allowed to quickly evaporate.The resulting slurry was treated with steam at 100 C during 10 minutes whereafter it was dried at 70 C in a nitrogen stream.Obtained were 220 g of a copolymer containing 8,2 by weight of butene and 91,8 by weight of ethylene such polymer being charaterized as is apparent from the values reported in theTable by a very low resistance to thermo oxidation.EXAMPLE 19It was operated as in example 15 with the exception that in the present case 10 ml of hexane containing 0,32 g of CHIMASSORB 944 were injected into the autoclave under an ethylene pressure after a 1 hour polymerization. At the end of the test there were obtained from 8,6 g of catalyst 207 g of copolymer at 6,5 by weight of butene containing 1540 ppm of stabilizer and endowed with a much higher resistance to thermo oxidation than in the preceding case as is apparent from the values reported in the Table.EXAMPLE 20 comparative test Into the same autoclave utilized in the preceding examples 18 and 19 there were introduced at room temperature and in a gaseous propylene flow 1,1 g of i C4Hg 3Al dissolved in 25 ml of hexane. Subsequently, 750 g of propylene were added, the temperature was quickly brought to 400C and ethylene was fed till reaching a total pressure of 18,8 kg cm2 gauge.Now a suspension consisting of 50 ml of hexane and 5,3 mg of the same catalyst used in example 18 was introduced under an ethylene pressure into the autoclave.The autoclave was maintained at 40 C and 18,8 kg cm2 g during 1 hour while continuously replenishing the consumed ethylene.At last, following the procedure of example 18, there were obtained 160 g of a rubber like polymer having a composition consisting for 55.4 by weight of ethylene and for 44 6 by weight of propylene and exhibiting an inherent viscosity equal to 4,05 dl g. The yield was of 30.2 kg of polymer of catalyst.As it results from the data in the Table, the resistance to thermo oxidation of the polymer is very low.EXAMPLE 21It was operated as in example 20 with the exception that in this case 30 minutes after the polymerization beginning 10 ml of hexane containing 0,39 g of CHIMASSORB 905 were introduced into the autoclave under ethylene pressure.At the end of the test there were obtained from 5 mg of catalyst 140 g of a copolymer having a composition consisting for 55,5 by weight of ethylene and for the remaining 44,5 by weight of propylene and exhibiting an inherent viscosity equal to 4.2 dl g. The yield was of 28 kg of polymer of catalyst. The polymer contains 2860 ppm of the stabilizing compound and, as it results from the Table, it has a much higher resistance to thermo oxidation than the polymer of example 20.
