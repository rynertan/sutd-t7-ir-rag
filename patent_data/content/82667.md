## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COtIPOSITIONS This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition having antiviral activity. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,601,020 discloses a small group of nucleoside analogues, namely 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridines, which have antiviral activity selective against herpes viruses.One of these compounds, E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine BVDU , has particularly good activity, but suffers from two disadvantages. Firstly, it is rapidly excreted in animal urine and, secondly, we have discovered that it is transformed in vivo to a metabolite with little or no antiviral activity. We have now found that, surprisingly, both the above disadvantages can be minimised by administering the deoxyuridine compound to an animal in combination with probenecid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Probenecid, of formula I ,EMI1.1 is known to block the renal tubular secretion of penicillin, but there is no evidence in the prior art that it could inhibit the transformation in vivo of nucleosides or nucleoside analogues to metabolites thereof. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula II EMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester thereof, whereinX is C1, Br, I or H, and probenecid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Preferably, X is Br. Suitable pharmaceuticall acceptable salts of probenecid include alkali or alkal ne earth metal salts, such as sodium or calcium, or ammonium or substituted ammonium salts. Probenecid inhibits the transformation of the compound of formula II to its inactive metabolite, especially when both compounds are administered by the oral route. This results in higher concentrations of the compound of formula II in animal tissues and, therefore, iim.p.tnved antiviral activity. The weight ratios of the compound of formula II or ester thereof to probenecid or a salt thereof in the composition of the invention may vary widely. A suitable ratio range is from 2 1 to 1 10 and a preferred range is from 1 1 to 1 3. The composition of the invention is preferably given by the oral route, and it may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The composition of the invention may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for infection. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of each active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg.Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating viral infections in human or non human animals which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of a compound of formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester thereof, in combination with an effective amount of probenecid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 A Experimental Procedure A single 100 mg kg dose of BVDU, alone or in combination with 100 mg kg or 200 mg kg of probenecid, was administered as a suspension in carboxymethyl cellulose to groups of 3 starved female Balb c mice.Blood was collected at 30, 75 or 85 and 120 minutes after dosing and the serum separated and stored at 200C. B Biological Assay Heat inactivated sera from single mice were titrated in plaque inhibition assays using the KOS strain of Herpes simplex type 1 virus in Vero cell monolayers. Antiviral activity is calculated by extrapolation from a standard inhibition dose response curve for BVDU and is quoted as the equivalent concentration of BVDU in pg mL giving the same activity in cell culture.HPLC AssayInstrument Waters H.P.L.C.Column RCM 100 C18 Reverse Phase Radical Compression ColumnSolvents Solvent A 0.05M Ammonium Acetate at pH4.5 Solvent B 80 Methanol, 10 Water, 10 A Conditions 50 B Detector wavelength 250 mp SolventFlow 1 and 3 mL min. Mouse serum samples 90 pL each were treated with 16 aqueous trichloroacetic acid solution 90 pL to deposit all proteins and the samples spun down using a micro centrifuge. The supernatant portions were assayed by injection 20 uL into a reverse phase HPLC column . The amounts of Probenecid were determined using a solvent flow of 3 mL min, when Probenecid had a retention time of 11.5 min. This flow rate however, showed no separation of BVDU from its metabolite and the solvent flow rate was decreased to 1 mL min. Under these conditions, the BVDU metabolite had retention time of 10.8 min and BVDU 11.6 min. The amounts ofBVDU and Probenecid were calculated by comparison with an injected known amount of.each drug.The amounts ofBVDU metabolite were calculated by assuming the same detector response as BVDU. All calculations were then extrapolated to give the amount of each component present in each serum sample in pg mL.

Since only BVDU and none of the metabolite was detected in the urine of the animals, the lower concentrations ot the metabolite in the sera of animals treated with the 100 mg kg BvDU 200 mg kg probenecid combination cannot be attributable to increased renal excretion and must be due to inhibition of the formation of the metabolite from BVDU. Example 2Activity of BVDU Probenecid in Virus infected Animals 1. Mouse Ear Herpesvirus Model Reference, H.J.Field, Antimicrob. Ag. Chemother., 21, 744 1982 This model is based upon comparisons of viral replication in, and inflammation of, the ears of untreated or treated mice after infection with herpesvirus. Procedure The left pinna of female Balb c mice were infected intradermally with 105 PFU of herpes simplex virus typeI strain SC 16 suspended in ZUp1 of Eagle minimum essential medium. The mice were treated orally 3 times daily from the time of infection until day T4 with BVD at 100mg kg dose or a 1 2 mixture of BVDU and probenecid 100 200mg kg dose . At selected times after infection groups of three mice were killed and the ear thickness of both the left and right ears measured using a micrometer gauge. The left ears were then removed and placed individually into 3ml of phosphate buffered saline. Samples were homogenised and sonicated. After centrifugation the supernatant was removed and assayed immediately in a plaque assay in Vero cells. Results In two experiments, Experiments A and B, a lower virus titre was found from day 4 onwards in the ears of infected mice that had been treated with theBVDU probenecid mixture than in the ears of those that had been administered tne same dose ot BVDU alone Table A . Additionally, the BVDU probenecid mixture caused a marked reduction in ear thickness, whereas BvDu alone had no effect. With the mixture a statistically significant reduction in inflammation was observed on days 7, 8 and 9 p U.U1 and days 11 and 12 p 0.05 post infection Table B . Example 3 Hairless mouse Cutaneous Herpesvirus Model When hairless mice are infected with herpesvirus by dermal scaritication, vesicles appear at the site ot inoculation b days later. These rapidly coalesce to torm a spreading unilateral lesion involving one hind quarter, leading eventually to ascending paralysis and death. The ettect ot treatments is assessed by a scoring method as lesions develop. Procedure Groupe or 10 adult hairless BrBr temale mice were anaesthetized using ether and then infected with herpes simplex virus type I strain SC 16 by scarifying an area 1cmê at a site parallel with the top of the left hind limb, just below the midline, and introducing a drop of virus containing solution to tunis site. single aaiiy aoses ot placebo, BvDu 100mg kg dose or a 1 2 mixture or BVDU and probenecid l00 200mg kg dose were administered orally for seven days, commencing 24 hours after infection. From 4 days atter infection individual mice were examined daily and scored according to the severity ot injection. Results A slower progression ot tne cutaneous injection was observed in those mice treated with theBVDU probenecid mixture than in those treated with BVDU alone Table C .
