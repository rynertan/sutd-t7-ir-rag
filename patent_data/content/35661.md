# CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF MONOMERS FROM POLYMERIC EMULSIONS

## Abstract
Continuous process for the removal of monomers and possible volatile substances from polymeric emulsions by stripping in a vapor current, during the coagulation phase of the emulsions, in the presence of coagulating agents, at temperatures between 100 and 150 C and at pressures of 1 5 atm., with dwell times of between 5 and 20 minutes.
