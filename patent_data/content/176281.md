# New scintillation media and methods of detecting beta ray emissions.

## Abstract
There is described a scintillation medium comprising at least one diisopropylnaphthalene, wherein said at least one diisopropylnaphthalene is liquid at a temperature of 50 C. There is also described a method of detecting Î² ray emissions using the scintillation medium.
