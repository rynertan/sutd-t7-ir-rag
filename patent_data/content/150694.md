# Heat recovery device.

## Abstract
Heat recovery from corrosive gases such as sulphurous flue gases and or flue gases containing organic acids, said corrosive gases being conducted through a primary side of heat exchanger means I II provided in a gas duct 1 . Said heat exchanger means are provided with means for repeatedly applying, during normal operation of said heat exchanger means, a protective controllable thin layer to the surfaces of said heat exchanger means, at least whenever the temperature of said corrosive gases exceeds the water dew point, in order to protect said surfaces from corrosion.
