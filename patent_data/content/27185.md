# Protective covering for the bend section of an endoscope.

## Abstract
A structure for preventing the breakage of both end por tions of a protective covering for an adjustable bend section 4 of an endoscope consists of annular elastic members 24, 25 retaining elasticity and adhesivity even at high tempera ture. Each of the elastic members 24, 25 of the structure comprises a first section 24a, 25a which is fixed by thread 20, 21 to the respective end portion 10a, 10b of a protective covering 10 which is made of elastic material and surrounds a core assembly 9 , and the respective end portion 10a, 10b of which is fastened to the respective end portions of the core assembly 9 by the thread 20, 21 and a second section 26, 27 which is made of the same material as that of the first section 24a, 25a and extends from the first section 24a, 25a toward the intermediate part of the protective covering 10 to be fixed to the respective end portion 10a, 10b of the protec tive covering 10 . With the above mentioned structure, the annular elastic members 24, 25 are not deteriorated even at high temperature.
