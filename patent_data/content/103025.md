# Pb ALLOY SOLDER FOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE.

## Abstract
A Pb alloy solder which contains 1 to 65 by weight of one or both of Sn and In, the residue being composed of Pb and unavoidable impurities, with less than 50 ppb of radio isotopes as unavoidable impurities, so that a count of the number of radioactive alpha particles is less than 0.5 CPH cmÂ², thereby providing excellent bonding strength and wet tability. 1 to 10 of Ag is also added to this solder to further improve the properties of the solder.
