# Stabilized radiolabelled compounds.

## Abstract
A stabiliser for radioactively labelled organic compounds has the general formula CHEM where R is C1 to C4 alkylene which may be OH substituted, m is 0 or 1 i.e. R may be absent or present , X is carboxyl or sulphonyl e.g. COOH or SO3H or a salt thereof and n is 1, 2 or 3. Radiolabelled compounds of biological origin, such as nucleotides and amino acids, may be stabilised either in solution or in the freeze dried state. For example, L 3 5 S methionine may be stabilised to prevent formation of a 47 KD band in protein transcription translation experiments.
