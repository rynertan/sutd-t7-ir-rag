# Mass spectrometers.

## Abstract
A mass spectrometer of the double focussing zero second order aberration type with first order spectrograph properties is described. The constructive parameters of which are related by specific equations within specific ranges. As a result the five aberration coefficients B1, B11, B12, B22, B2, characterising angle and velocity aberrations of first and sec ond order of the ion beam, can all be simultaneously zero, whereas in double focussing spectrometers of the conven tional type these coefficients are not all simultaneously zero and the ion beam shows an angle and velocity aberration.
