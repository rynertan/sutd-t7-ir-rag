# Pressure control system for a pressurized water nuclear reactor plant.

## Abstract
An improved pressure control system 1 for a pres surized water nuclear reactor plant contains a two stage sparger in a pressurizer relief tank. The two stage sparger has a primary conduit 31 and secondary conduit 37 , both of which have orifices 33, 44 and an intermediate valve 49 that is responsive to a pressure differential between the two conduits 31, 37 , the secondary conduit being preferably of a diameter less, but having a larger area of orifices.
