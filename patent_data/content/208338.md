# INDUCTION HEATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An induction heating apparatus comprises an induction heating coil 12 and means 30, 32 for passing an alternating current through the coil to cause induction heating therein, characterised in that at least one further coil 12 is provided adjacent and in axial alignment with the heating coil, the or each further coil 12 being electrically isolated from the means 30, 32 for passing an alternating current and being connected to form a resonant circuit 26 arranged to resonate when alternating current passes through the heating coil 12 thereby to provide additional induction heating.
