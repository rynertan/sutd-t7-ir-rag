# Tracking apparatus for rotary magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A tracking apparatus applicable to a rotatable magnetic recording medium 10 which is provided with a plurality of discrete tracks thereon includes a head 26 for sensing signals out of the tracks, a head transport mechanism 28, 30, 50 for moving the head 26 to a position on a desired one of the tracks, an envelope detector 38, 44, 46 for detecting an envelope of signals sensed by the head 26 , and a controller 60 for performing tracking by controlling the head transport mechanism 28, 30, 50 responsive to the detected envelope. A sync signal generator circuit 22, 24 is provided for producing a reference signal which is synchronous to the rotation of the recording medium 10 . The controller 60 controls the head transport mechanism 28, 30, 50 and causes the envelope detector 38, 44, 46 to detect an envelope, responsive to the reference signal.
