# LIGHT DETECTING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A light detecting circuit in which noise superposed on a bias voltage of a photodiode is substantially canceled without the aid of a filter circuit employing an inductor. The photo diode is connected between a bias voltage terminal and an inverting terminal of a main amplifier, the latter being implemented with a differential amplifier or a comparator. A capacitance device is connected between the same bias vol tage terminal and the other noninverting input terminal of the main amplifier. The capacitance device may be either a physical capacitor or a second photodiode which, in either case, should have a capacitance equal to the parasitic capaci tance of the first photodiode.
