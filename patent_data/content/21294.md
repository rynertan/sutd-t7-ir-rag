# Chemical detoxification of toxic chlorinated aromatic compounds.

## Abstract
A method for the reduction of the content of toxic chlorinated aromatic compounds such as chlorinated aromatic dioxins and especially chlorinated dibenzo p dioxins in reaction products to virtually zero consisting essentially of reacting a mass containing chlorinated aromatic dioxins with an amount, in excess of stoichiometrical based on the total organic halogen content, of alkaline reactants selected from the group consisting of 1 alkali metal alcoholates of alcohols selected from the group consisting of alkanols having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, polyalkoxyalkane glycols having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, alkanepolyols having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms and 2 to 3 hydroxyls, and monoalkyl ethers of such alkanepolyols with alkanols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or 2 mixtures of said alcohols with alkaline reactants selected from the group consisting of alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates, at a reaction temperature of from 140 C. to 220 C. for a time sufficient to convert the organic halogen into inorganic halide, recovering a reaction mass essentially free of chlorinated aromatic dioxins, and optionally suspending said recovered reaction mass in water and extracting with an organic solvent to remove any minute residual chlorinated aromatic dioxins, and recycling said solvent extract to said reacting step.
