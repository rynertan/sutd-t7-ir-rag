## Description
This invention relates to polymers comprising 2 imidazolin 5 one units. In another aspect, it relates to a process for preparing heterocycle containing polymers. The novel polymers are useful in water treatment and paper and fabric sizing applications. Low molecular weight 2 imidazolin 5 ones, which are also referred to in the art as imidazolinones indexed in Chemical Abstracts as 3,5 dihydro 4 French Patent No. 887,530 1943 describes the preparation of high molecular weight polyamides and polyesteramides by the reaction of bisazlactones with diamines, diols, or aminoalcohols. This reference teaches that with amino compounds reaction temperatures must be kept as low as possible, preferably between 80 and 150 C. In addition, it is stated that with primary amines, extra precautions must be taken to prevent side reactions from occurring. It is recommended that a solvent be used to help keep the reaction temperature low. Polyamides from bisazlactones and diamines have also been described by C. S. Cleaver and B. C. Pratt Ueda, Briefly, the present invention provides a class of block and random polymers comprising 0.5 to 100 mole percent 2 imidazolin 5 one units contained within the main polymer backbone. The novel heterocycle containing homopolymers and copolymers of the invention can be prepared by a ring opening reaction of an azlactone functional compound with a nucleophilic group substituted primary amine, optionally in the presence of additional condensation type monomers, to provide a polyamide. The resultant polyamide in the presence of a cyclodehydration catalyst can be subsequently converted to the heterocycle containing polymers of the invention. In this application an 2 oxazolin 5 one azlactone nucleus means monomer means a compound having no recognizable repeating unit, that is, could not be readily prepared by the linking together of suitable monomers followed, if necessary, by chemical modification of the end groups non nucleophilic group means a group incapable of a nucleophilic ring opening reaction with an azlactone, i.e., groups other than amines, alcohols, and thiols The present invention provides a class of polymers comprising 0.5 to 100 mole percent of 2 imidazolin 5 one units and 99.5 to 0 mole percent of other units derived from condensation type monomers, the 2 imidazolin 5 one units having the structural formula I wherein The novel polymers of this invention can be prepared by reaction of azlactone functional compounds of formula III wherein wherein The initial result of this reaction is the formation of a polyamide having a repeating unit of formula IV wherein and Copolymers containing less than 100 of units of formula I may be prepared by incorporation of other condensation type monomers as mentioned below along with compounds of formulas II and III or combination or mixtures thereof. Condensation of the comonomer and the above described azlactone and amine results in polymer units e.g., ester, amide, urethane, or urea units which cannot cyclize to imidazolinone units. The azlactone functional compounds of formula III useful for the purposes of the present invention are of two types. Preferred formula III compounds are bisazlactones of formula V wherein R¹, R², and R⁵ are as defined above. Bisazlactones of formula V are well known in the art. Bisazlactones in which R⁵ is hydrocarbyl, as defined above, for example, are readily prepared by reaction of a corresponding diacid chloride with an appropriate amino acid followed by cyclodehydration Equation 2 below using, for example, acetic anhydride C.S Cleaver, B. C. Pratt, Another class of bisazlactones useful in the present invention are those that can be prepared by a Michael type addition of an amino or thiol group substituted nucleophilic compound to an alkenyl azlactone and are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,485,236. Second types of azlactone functional compounds are those of formula VI, wherein R¹, R², R⁵, and Y are as defined above, and can be prepared by procedures analogous to those used for the preparation of bisazlactones of formula V. For example, the monoadduct of a diacid and an aminoacid can be converted to an azlactone functional compound possessing a carboxylic acid group see Equation 3 below . The preparation of other compounds VI should be obvious to one skilled in the art. The nucleophilic group substituted monomeric, oligomeric, or polymeric amines of general formula II which are useful in the preparation of the novel polymers of the invention can vary widely within the scope of this invention. Representative examples of monomeric amines of formula II include di primary diamines, such as ethylene diamine, 1,2 propanediamine, 1,4 diaminobutane 1,6 hexanediamine, 1,12 dodecanediamine, 1,4 diaminocyclohexane, 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylamine , available from Texaco Chemical, Inc. Bellaire, TX , N,N , bis 3 aminopropyl ethylenediamine, N,N 1 bis 3 aminopropyl 1,4 butanediamine, and 6,6 diaminodihexylamine. Polymeric amines of formula II include a wide variety of amine functional polymers such as polyoxyalkylenediamines, amine terminated polyamides, polysiloxane diamines, amino functional polybutadienes and polybutadiene copolymers, and polyethylenimine. Examples of the polyoxyalkylene diamines include the polyethylene and polypropylene oxide based diamines available from Texaco Chemical under the trade name Jeffamine ED and D series respectively and the DU Series Jeffamines prepared by thermal condensation of D series Jeffamines and urea according to U.S. Patent 4,178,427. Other useful polyoxyalkylene diamines can be readily prepared from various polyethylene , polypropylene , or polytetramethylene glycols via standard cyanoethylation reduction procedures well known in the art. Amine terminated polyamides of use in the invention may be readily prepared, as is obvious to one skilled in the art, by the polymerization reaction of an excess amount of diamine with a dicarboxylic acid or diacid derivative, e. g., diester or of a diamine with an amino acid or its corresponding lactam . In these polymerizations it is apparent to one skilled in the art that the molecular weight of the amine terminated polyamide can be controlled by adjustment of the relative amounts of diamine and diacid or aminoacid utilized. A particular class of amine terminated polyamides which can be utilized in the invention are those prepared by reaction of a diacid and a polyether diamine according to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,107,061 and 3,257,342. Polysiloxane diamines of use in the invention have the formula VII wherein These materials are readily prepared by the base catalyzed equilibration of cyclic siloxanes e.g. dimethylsiloxane tetramer using standard reaction conditions see, e.g. I. Yilgor, et. al., Reaction of azlactone functional compounds of formula III with amines of formula II to provide intermediate polyamides of formula IV is known in the art see Cleaver and Pratt, Intermediate polyamides of formula IV may also be prepared preferably under standard melt condensation conditions e.g., 30 350 C, preferably 100 300 C under reduced pressure, e.g., less than 13.3kPa 100 torr from the acyclic precursors of azlactones of formula III and the amines of formula II, as shown in Equation 4 below wherein and While it is known in the art that condensation polymerisation of β aminoacid derivatives is possible see for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,393,912, and 4,429,109, on preparations of polyesters and polyamides respectively from N,N terephthaloyl β alanine , applicants are not aware of any examples of the polymerization of α aminoacid derivatives as depicted in Equation 4. The conversion of intermediate polyamides of formula IV to the heterocycle containing polymers of the present invention can be accomplished in general by heating the polyamides in the presence of a catalyst for the imidazolinone ring forming dehydration reaction. Temperatures useful for this conversion are in the range of 30 to 350 C, preferably 100 C to 300 C, and most preferably in the range 150 C to 250 C. Reaction times needed for the cyclization vary depending upon the nature of the intermediate polyamide and the catalyst, but generally range from 0.5 hour to 48 hours, preferably 0.5 to 18 hours. In general it is desirable to conduct both the preparation of the intermediate polyamide and the cyclization reaction under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon. In addition it is preferred to conduct the later stages of the cyclization reaction under reduced pressure, e.g. less than 13.3kPa 100 torr to ensure removal of the last traces of water which are formed. Both acids and bases can catalyze the cyclization. When basic catalysts are used, they may be classified as either internal or external catalysts. By internal is meant that the catalyst is present as part of the polymer structure for example, as secondary or tertiary amine functionality in the polymer backbone . Polyamides containing such internal catalysts have been found to undergo conversion to the polymers of the invention with surprising facility, for example, heating at 180 C for 2 hours. With those polyamides which do not contain an internal catalyst, an external catalyst must be added to accomplish the dehydration. Examples of basic catalysts which may be added are Examples of acidic catalysts which may be added are Lewis acids such as dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin diacetate, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, zinc acetate, zinc cyanide, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, ferric chloride, boron trifluoride, and tetrabutyl titanate. As should be obvious to one skilled in the art, the rate of cyclization of a particular polyamide will be controlled by a number of variables including the structure of the polyamide, the nature of the catalyst and its efficiency, and the temperature and length of time at which the reaction is conducted. While in most instances it may be desirable to obtain complete cyclization to imidazolinone units, it is contemplated as being within the scope of the invention to convert only a portion of the amide linkages to imidazolinone units. This may be accomplished by control of the variables cited above, in particular the reaction time. The extent of cyclization is readily determined by examination of the ¹H NMR spectrum of the poly imidazolinone and comparing its spectrum with the spectrum of the polyamide precursor. In addition, ¹³C NMR can be used to verify the formation of the imidazolinone ring. It is contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention to prepare polymers in which less than 100 of the repeating units have the structure I. As should be obvious to one skilled in the art, this may be accomplished by the addition of other specified condensation type monomers to the reaction mixture of azlactone of formula III and amine of formula II. These additional monomers may be added either at the beginning of the polymerization reaction, or subsequent to the preparation of a polyamide of formula IV. Proper adjustment of reactant stoichiometry will ensure copolymer formation as is well known in the art. Condensation type monomers which may be added include dicarboxylic acids or their derivatives such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, dimer acid, dimethyl adipate, dimethyl terephthalate, succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, and benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride diols such as ethylene glycol and butyleneglycol polyether diols such as polyethyleneglycol and polypropyleneglycol polyester diols such as polycaprolactone diol, polyneopentyl adipatediol, and other hydroxyterminated polyesters amino acids and hydroxyacids or their derivatives such as caprolactone, caprolactam, 11 aminoundecanoic acid, glycolic acid, 12 aminododecanoic acid, lauryllactam, and 4 hydroxybutyric acid and diisocyanates such as toluene diisocyanate, methylenediphenyl diisocyanate, and 1,6 hexanediisocyanate. By incorporation of these additional comonomers it is possible to prepare, for example, poly amide imidazolinone , poly ester imidazolinone , poly urethane imidazolinone , poly urea imidazolinone , and poly imide imidazolinone copolymers. In general, the imidazolinone containing polymers of the present invention have been found to be lower melting, more soluble in a variety of solvents, and more thermally stable than their polyamide precursors. Quite surprisingly, many of the polyimidazolinones have been found to be water soluble or water dispersible. This property coupled with the multiplicity of polar functional groups provide polymers which have utility in such applications as the chelation of metal ions, flocculation and water clarification, paper and fabric sizing, etc. Solutions of the polymers display fluorescence under long wavelength UV light, thus suggesting potential use as optical brighteners, for example in fabric treatments or laundry detergent formulations. Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples. In all cases reactions were conducted under an inert atmosphere of argon or nitrogen. Triethylenetetramine 2.9g, 0.02 Mol was dissolved in dimethylformamide DMF 20 mL . To this mixture was added, with stirring, 2,2 tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyloxazolin 5 one 5.6g, 0.02 Mol . The temperature of the mixture rapidly rose to about 50 C, then slowly cooled back to room temperature about 25 C over 45 minutes. Stirring was continued at room temperature for 22 hours, then 10 mL of the mixture was withdrawn and precipitated into 200 mL acetone. The precipitate was filtered, washed with ether, and dried under vacuum at 50 60 C overnight to yield 2.80 g of colorless product, inherent viscosity 0.5g 100mL DMF 0.12 dL g. Spectral analyses verified the polyamide structure. A sample of the polymer prepared and isolated as in A. above was placed in a round bottomed flask equipped with a vacuum take off. The flask was evacuated to a pressure of about 133Pa 1 torr and placed in an oil bath. The temperature of the bath was raised to 180 C over 45 minutes, then held at 180 190 C for two hours and 15 minutes. Bubbling of the molten polymer mass was observed this was fairly rapid at first but had nearly ceased at the end of the heating period. The bath was removed, the polymer was allowed to cool, then was broken up and collected as a light yellow, glassy material. Spectral analyses indicated essentially complete cyclization of the amide function to the imidazolinone structure. The remainder of the polyamide solution in DMF from A. above was heated to 140 C and held at that temperature for 4 hours, then precipitated into acetone 250 mL to give a gummy oil. The supernatant was decanted, and the oil triturated with ether, filtered, and dried as in A. to give 1.06 g colorless polymer, inherent viscosity 0.18 dL g DMF . Spectral analyses indicated about 50 cyclization of the amide linkages to the imidazolinone structure. This example shows addition of a cyclization catalyst is not necessary when there are amino groups, i.e., internal , present in the polyamide. p Phenylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 3.0g, 0.01 Mol and Jeffamine D 400 polyoxypropylene diamine, amine equivalent weight 217.3, 4.35g, 0.01 Mol were mixed in a round bottomed flask to give a paste. No apparent reaction occurred at room temperature. The contents of the flask were placed under a flow of argon and the flask immersed, with stirring, in a Wood s metal bath at 200 C. The reaction mixture rapidly solidified. The bath temperature was raised to 250 C over 25 minutes, by which time the polymer mass had remelted. Heating was continued for 2 hours at 250 C, the additional 1.5 hours at 250 C under reduced pressure 133Pa 1 torr . The heating bath was then removed, and the molten polymer poured onto a teflon sheet. Upon cooling, a hard, brittle solid was formed. Spectral analysis indicated that the product was the polyamide and that no cyclization had occurred. This example shows the lack of cyclization in the absence of a catalyst. p Phenylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 3.00g, 0.01 Mol and Jeffamine D 2000 19.44g, 0.01 Mol were mixed at room temperature under argon, then placed in an oil bath at 220 C. The stirred mixture was heated for 1 hour at 220 C, the last 30 minutes under vacuum less than 133Pa 1 torr . Spectral analysis of a sample A indicated that the expected polyamide had been formed. Sodium acetate 0.082 g, 0.001 Mol was added and the mixture heated 1 hour at 220 C, less than 133Pa 1 torr . IR analysis of a sample indicated a small amount of cyclization had occurred. Another portion of sodium acetate 0.164 g, 0.002 Mol was added and heating continued under the same conditions for an additional 3 hours. Spectral analysis of the final product Sample B indicated about 40 cyclization to imidazolinone units. Molecular weight data obtained by GPC on the polymers were as follows This example illustrates the use of an external catalyst. A polyamide was prepared from p phenylenbis 4 methyl 2 oxazolin 5 one and Jeffamine D 2000 by a procedure similar to that of Example 2 except that a bath temperature of 250 C was required. Addition of sodium acetate 30 mole and further heating 240 C, 1 hour, less than 133Pa 1 torr caused the polymer to darken and become opaque in the melt. Spectral analysis revealed no evidence for cyclization. Similarly, a polyamide was prepared, as in Example 2, from p phenylenebis 2 oxazolin 5 one and Jeffamine D 2000 as in Example 2 but a temperature of 300 C was required. Addition of sodium acetate and further heating resulted in decomposition of the polymer. Comparative Examples 2 and 3 show the necessity of having R¹ and or R² not be hydrogen in order for imidazolinone formation to occur. The purpose of this example is to study the effectiveness of various catalysts in accomplishing cyclization to imidazolinone units. Equivalent amounts of p phenylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one and Jeffamine D 2000 were mixed along with 5 mole of the desired catalyst. The stirred mixture was heated at 240 C under argon for 30 minutes, then an additional 1.5 hours under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr and collected. ¹H NMR analysis was used to estimate the amount of cyclization. Results are listed in TABLE I below. N,N Azeleoylbis α aminoisobutyric acid 17.92g, 0.05 Mol and N methyliminobispropylamine 7.26 g, 0.05 Mol were mixed and heated under argon by means of Wood s metal bath from 150 C to 175 C over 10 minutes, then held at that temperature for 2 hours 20 minutes. Vacuum was applied 66.5Pa 0.5 torr and the reaction mixture heated at 180 190 C for the next 3.5 hours. The mixture was then reacted further under vacuum at 205 220 C for 7 hours and at 245 C for 5 hours. IR analysis of samples taken at various intervals indicated slow formation and cyclization of the polyamide. Spectral analysis of the final product verified the presence of both amide and imidazolinone structures. This example illustrates use of an acyclic precursor of a bisazlactone. N,N Adipoylbis glycine 15.61 g, 0.06 Mol and N methyliminobispropylamine 8.71 g, 0.06 Mol were mixed and heated using a Wood s metal bath at 200 C under argon for about 2 hours, then for an additional 2 hours under vacuum. During the course of the reaction, the mixture gradually turned dark and finally gelled to give a glassy, insoluble mass. IR analysis of the product showed the presence of amide but no imidazolinone abosorptions. Similarly, attempts to prepare polyimidazolinones from N,N adipoylbis glycine and 1,6 hexanediamine, a 50 50 mixture of 1,6 hexanediamine and Jeffamine ED 900, or Jeffamine ED 900 alone, or from N,N sebacoylbis alanine and 1,6 hexanediamine produced crosslinked materials with no evidence for imidazolinone formation. This example again illustrates the necessity of having R¹ and or R² not equal to hydrogen. A flask was charged with azeleoylbis α aminoisobutyric acid 8.96 g, 0.025 Mol , azelaic acid 4.70 g, 0.025 Mol , and N,N bis 3 aminopropyl piperazine 10.01 g, 0.05 Mol . The stirred mixture, under an argon atmosphere, was heated in a Wood s metal bath at 190 200 C for 7 hours, the last 4 hours under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr . Spectral analysis of the glassy, reddish orange polymer indicated 70 cyclization to imidazolinone units. Fibers could be pulled from the melt. Addition of sodium pivalate 0.5 g and heating 220 240 C in vacuum an additional 6 hours resulted in greater than 90 cyclization. Another polyamide poly imidazoline copolymer was prepared by a procedure similar to that of Example 5 from azeleoylbis α aminoisobutyric acid 0.05 Mol , azelaic acid 0.10 Mol and N,N bis 3 aminopropyl piperazine 0.15 Mol . The final copolymer contained 33 imidazolinone units. Polyamides were prepared by reacting 1,6 hexanediamine with equivalent amounts of the bisazlactones of Examples 2 and comparative Examples 2 and 3, respectively, in N methylpyrrolidone as solvent at room temperature. The polyamides precipitated during the course of this polymerization reaction and were isolated in greater than 95 yield by filtration. IR and ¹H NMR in CF₃COOH spectra verified this polyamide structure. Differential thermal analysis DTA of all three polyamides indicated weight loss in the 150 200 C range, which could be interpreted as being due to imidazolinone formation by thermal dehydration. Heating samples of the polymers on a laboratory scale under vacuum, however, gave no evidence of imidazolinone formation but rather resulted in no change or in crosslinking or decomposition. To the bisazlactone obtained from the Michael type addition of Jeffamine CD 230 and 2 vinyl 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 12.57g, 20.2 mMol according to U.S. Patent No. 4,485,236 was added 3,3 iminobispropylamine 2.72g, 20.8 mMol . A rapid exotherm ensued and within 5 minutes the reaction mixture had solidified. The reaction mixture, under an argon flow, was immersed in a Wood s metal bath, with stirring, at 100 C. The bath temperture was raised to 175 C over 25 minutes and held at this temperature for 30 minutes. The temperature was then raised to 210 C, held there 30 minutes, then applied vacuum 200Pa 1.5 torr for 1 hour at 210 C. The reaction was stopped and the polymer, when cool, was a dark red, viscous oil. Spectral analyses indicated essentially complete cyclization to imidazolinone. Bis 2 mercaptoethyl ether 6.9g, 0.05 Mol was charged to an oven dried flask, then 2 drops ethanesulfonic acid was added. To the stirring mixture was added 2 vinyl 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 13.9g, 0.1 Mol . The resulting exotherm was controlled by application of an ice water bath for about 4 minutes, then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 hours. The flask containing the resultant bisazlactone was then returned to the ice bath and triethylenetetramine 7.31g, 0.05 Mol was added by syringe. A rapid viscosity increase occurred followed by solidifcation. Addition of toluene 20 mL and tetrahydrofuran 20 mL failed to dissolve the polymer. Therefore the flask was placed in a Wood s metal bath at 150 C, the solvents were distilled out over 15 minutes, then the bath temperature was raised to 195 C. Heating was continued at this temperature for 3.5 hours, the last 15 minutes being under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr , then the polymer was collected. Upon cooling, the polymer was a somewhat flexible, though glassy solid the polymer was water soluble. Spectral analyses verified the poly imidazolinone structure. Using reaction conditions similar to those of Example 7, the following polymers were prepared Example 9 from equivalent amounts of the bisazlactone of Example 7 and ethylenediamine spectral analyses verified the structure of the intermediate polyamide, inherent viscosity 0.5g 100mL CHCl₃ 0.114. Spectral analyses on the cyclized product indicated a majority of imidazolinone units, although some amide linkages remained, inherent viscosity CHCl₃ 0.114 the polymer was a water soluble, sticky viscous material. Tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 14.02g, 0.05 Mol and N methyliminobispropylamine 7.26g, 0.05 Mol were reacted by a procedure similar to that of Example 2 except that the reaction temperature was 200 210 C for about 2 hours, the last hour under vacuum 200Pa 1.5 torr . The brittle, light yellow polymer was water soluble. Spectral analyses verified the poly imidazolinone structure. A slurry was prepared from tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 14.02g, 0.05 Mol and 4,9 dioxa 1,12 dodecane diamine 10.22g, 0.05 Mol . The flask containing this mixture was placed in a Wood s metal bath heated to 120 C. The bath temperature was slowly raised to 200 C over 2.5 hours, then heating was continued at 200 210 C, 13.3Pa 0.1 torr , for 40 minutes. Spectral analysis of a sample of the polymer verified formation of the polyamide. Sodium acetate 1 g. was added, and heating was continued under vacuum for an additional hour. IR analysis of a sample of the polymer indicated some cyclization had occurred. Heating under vacuum for another two hours caused additional but not complete cyclization. Another portion of sodium acetate 1 g. was added and heating under vacuum continued for another 3 hours at which time spectral analyses showed nearly complete conversion to the cyclized structure. This light yellow, brittle, glassy polymer was soluble in water. A poly imidazolinone was prepared by a procedure similar to that of Example 12 from tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one and 1,6 hexanediamine. This polymer formed a cloudy dispersion in water. A poly imidazolinone was prepared by a procedure similar to that of Example 13 except that 50 mole of the hexanediamine was replaced by an equivalent amount of Jeffamine D 2000 amine equivalent weight 1023 and only 6 by weight based on bisazlactone of sodium acetate was used as catalyst. In this case, cyclization was much slower, requiring a total of 6.5 hours at 215 C plus 7 hours at 225 230 C to achieve complete ring closure. The final polymer was a viscous liquid, not soluble in water. Tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one 11.28g, 0.04 Mol and 2 2 hydroxyethoxy ethyl amine 4.20g, 0.04 Mol were mixed in a flask under argon and placed in a Wood s metal bath at 85 C. The reaction temperature was raised to 150 C over 25 minutes, held there for 1.75 hours, then allowed to cool. Spectral analysis of a sample of the product verified the anticipated polyesteramide structure. Sodium pivalate 0.248g, 0.002 Mol was added and the flask was replaced in the metal bath at 185 C. The temperature was raised to 235 C over 1 hour, held at 235 240 C for 45 minutes under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr then allowed to cool. Cyclization of the amide units to imidazolinone units was verified by spectral analyses. The brittle, glassy poly esterimidazolinone was water soluble. Tetramethylenebis 4,4 pentamethylene 2 oxazolin 5 one 0.5 g, 1.38 mMol and diethylenetriamine 0.143 g, 1.38 mMol were reacted for 1 hr at 120 C, then 6 hr. at 160 C under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr to produce a hard, brittle polymer, inherent viscosity DMF, 30 C 0.1. Spectral analysis ¹³C NMR 160.5, 185.1 ppm verified the poly imidazolinone structure. A poly imidazolinone was prepared from equivalent amounts of tetramethylenebis 4,4 dimethyl 2 oxazolin 5 one and p phenylenediamine by a procedure similar to that of Example 3, using 10 mole of sodium pivalate as a catalyst. The final polymer was a clear, brittle solid, soluble in chloroform. Spectral analysis indicated essentially complete cyclization to the poly imidazolinone structure. A poly amide imidazolinone was prepared from N,N sebacoylbis α aminoisobutyric acid 7.44 g, 0.02 Mol , N 2 aminoethyl piperazine 1.81 g, 0.014 Mol , and Kemamine DP 3680 a C₃₆ aliphatic dimer diprimary amine available from Humko Sheffield, Memphis, Tennessee, amine equivalent weight 290, 2.48 g, 0.006 Mol . The stirred mixture was heated under argon at 200 220 C for 4.5 hours, the last 30 minutes being under vacuum 133Pa 1 torr . The product was a light yellow, glassy solid. Spectral analyses verified the anticipated structure.
