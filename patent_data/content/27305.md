# Phenanthrene derived thermally stable polyamide imide resins and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to thermally stable resins and pro vides such a resin made from cheaply available coal derived materials, whereas presently available resins are made from increasinly expensive oil derived materials. The resin comprises the condensation product of a reac tion between an aromatic diamine and a phenanthrene formaldehyde reaction product, which product has been oxid ised to produce keto groups bridging the phenanthrene moeties and carboxy groups. The condensation product is a poly amide imide . The invention also includes a method of making the resin and varnishes containing the resin.
