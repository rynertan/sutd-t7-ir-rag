# Fatty acid derivatives and processes of producing them.

## Abstract
Water soluble fibrinolytic fatty acid derivatives of formula I , and salts thereof CHEM in which R 1 represents an alkanoylamino group the carbon chain of which may be interrupted by at least one oxygen atom, an alkanoyloxy group the carbon chain of which is interrupted by at least one oxygen atom, an alkoxyimino group, or a group shown by the formula R 3 NH Y CO m Z wherein R 3 represents an alkanoyl group or a C1 C5 alkylsulfonyl group Y represents an alkylene group m represents 1 or 2 and Z represents an oxygen atom or an imino group R 3 represents an alkyl group, an alkylaminocarbonyl group the carbon chain of which may be interrupted by at least one oxygen atom, or an alkoxyaminocarbonyl group the carbon chain of which is interrupted by at least one oxygen atom represents a single bond or a double bond a is zero when is a double bond and 1 when is a single bond b is 0 or 1 c is 0 or 1 n represents an integer of 1 to 3 and A and B are the same or different amino acid residues. Various processes for the production of these compounds are as described.
