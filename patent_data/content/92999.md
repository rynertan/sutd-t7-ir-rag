The semi open cell elastic or flexible foam layer 12 can be formed from various elastomer materials such as polyester or polyether polyurethane foams, styrene butadiene foams, certain rubber based foam, etc. The material should, of course, be non toxic and stable. The preferred material is a flexible polyurethane foam having from about 50 to about 100 cells per linear inch 2.54 cm with about 80 cells per linear inch 2.54 cm being most preferred.

The outer layer 11 can be a polymeric elastic or flexible film coating formed from a water impermeable pliable elastomer material such as flexible polyurethane, polyacrylate, polyethylene,etc. Layer 11 can be a skin of such polymeric material flame laminated to the top of foam layer 12 by means of heat and or pressure. The exposed sides of polymeric foam layer 12 can also be coated or heat and or pressure treated to form an impermeable film or skin. Polyurethane is the preferred material for film or skin 11. In a typical dressing, adhesive layer 14 will vary in thickness from about 0.02 inches 0.5 mm to about 0.1 inches 2.54 mm , preferably about 0.05 inches 1.27 mm , adhesive layer 13 will vary in thickness from about 0.005 inches 0.127 mm to about 0.02 inches 0.5 mm , preferably about 0.015 inches 0.38 mm , foam layer 12 will vary in thickness from about 0.03 inches 0.76 mm to about 0.1 inches 2.54 mm , preferably about 0.065 inches 1.65 mm and outer layer or skin 11 will vary in thickness from about 0.001 inches 0.0254 mm to about 0.003 inches 0.076 mm , preferably about 0.002 inches 0.05 mm . As shown in figs. 3 and 4, a layer of deodorizing material can be included between the two adhesive layers. Suitable deodorizing materials include a sheet of foamed polymeric material such as polyurethane having a large number of activated carbon particles bound to the matrix of the foam. Such a material is commercially available under the tradename Bondina. Another type of deodorizing material is a paper or felt like substance containing activated carbon such as that commercially available under the tradename K felt Toyobo or Getter paper Mead . The layer of deodorizing material will vary from about .010 to 0.100 inches 0.254 to 2.54 mm . The dressing 10 is prepared as follows. First, adhesive layer 14 is prepared by forming a homogeneous dispersion of the pressure sensitive adhesive material with a heavy duty mixer, e.g., a kneader mixer or sigma blade mixer. The hydrocolloid gums, water swellable cohesive strengthening agents, hydratable polymers, and any other optional ingredients are added and mixing is continued until a homogeneous dough is formed. This dough is then extruded into a thick slab which is thinned down by pressure rollers to the desired thickness. Next, adhesive layer 13 is prepared by forming a mixture of the hydrocolloid gums, pressure sensitive adhesive materials, tackifier and plasticizer, as well as other optional ingredients such as thermoplastic elastomers, water swellable cohesive strengthening agents, hydratable polymers, antioxidants, etc., in an organic solvent such as heptane or hexane. The resulting adhesive slurry is then applied to a web of silicone coated release paper and the solvent is evaporated. Upon drying the hydrocolloids are dispersed throughout the adhesive layer. This adhesive material is then compressed with a laminate of semi open cell flexible polymeric foam having a water impermeable polymeric coating or skin on one side. Finally, the silicone coated release paper is stripped away from adhesive layer 13 and adhesive layers 13 and 14 are pressed together with heat to form the dressing. Silicone coated release paper can then be applied to the exposed surface of adhesive layer 14 and the dressing can be cut to the desired shape and packaged. After packaging, the dressing can be sterilized by gamma irradiation. Dressing 30 is prepared in a similar manner except that a layer of deodorizing material is laminated between adhesive layers 14 and 13. Alternatively, dressing 30 can be prepared by first laminating adhesive layer 13 directly to the layer of deodorizing material 31 and then attaching this adhesive coated material to foam layer 12. In the case of dressing 50, adhesive layer 14 is prepared as described above and is then laminated while warm directly to foam layer 12 by means of pressure. The following are representative examples of dressings within the scope of the invention. A dressing was prepared having the following composition Semi open cell polyurethane foam having a polyurethane skin flame laminated to one surface. Adhesive layer 14 was prepared as follows. A premix was prepared by blending 1.4 kg. of gelatin, 1.4 kg. of pectin, and 1.4 kg. of sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The blended premix was added to a heavy duty sigma blade type mixer followed by the addition of 1.4 kg. of polyisobutylene. After mixing for 10 minutes, an additional 1.4 kg. of polyisobutylene was added and mixing continued until a homogeneous dough was formed about 10 to 20 minutes . This dough mass while hot and soft was extruded and thinned down by pressure rollers to a thickness of about 0.05 inches 1.27 mm . A laminate of adhesive layer 13 to semi open cell polymeric foam layers 12 and 11 was prepared as follows. A mixture of 0.31 kg. of polyisobutylene Vistanex L 100 , 0.28 kg. of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and 0.23 kg. of gelatin was kneaded. This mixture was added to a solution of heptane containing 0.28 kg. of polyisobutylene Vistanex LM MH , 0.31 kg. of piccolyte resin, 8 g. of butylated hydroxytoluene, and 0.13 kg. of mineral oil to form an adhesive slurry. A portion of this slurry was poured onto a sheet of silicone coated release paper and the solvent evaporated to leave an adhesive layer of about 0.015 inches 0.38 mm in thickness . This adhesive layer was laminated to a semi open cell polyurethane foam of 0.065 inches 1.65 mm thickness having a polyurethane skin of about 0.002 inches 0.05 mm thickness on one surface by gently compressing the adhesive layer to the foam by passing through pressure rollers. The silicone coated release paper was then stripped from adhesive layer 13 and adhesive layer 13 and adhesive layer 14 were compressed together by passing through pressure rollers. Silicone coated release paper was then pressed onto the exposed surface of adhesive layer 14. The resulting dressing was cut into the desired shape and packaged. Following the procedure of Example 1 but employing 40 Polyisobutylene Vistamex LM MH and 60 Guar gum on a weight percent basis in adhesive layer 14 another dressing within the scope of this invention is obtained. Following the procedure of Example 1 but employing the ingredients listed below on a weight percent basis in adhesive layer 13 other dressings within the scope of this invention are obtained. The wound packing material is a granular product of from about 10 to about 40 mesh particle size and comprises a water dispersable hydrocolloidal material or a mixture of such materials. The granular product can also optionally include up to about 50 by weight of one or more water swellable cohesive strengthening agents and or one or more hydratable polymers. Suitable water dispersable hydrocolloidal materials include sodium and calcium carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, gelatin, guar gum, locust bean gum, collagen, and gum karaya. Suitable water swellable cohesive strengthening agents include finely divided substantially water insoluble cross linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose such as that commercially available under the trademark Aqualon or that described in U.S. Patent 3,589,364 and available commercially from the Buckeye Cellulose Corp., finely divided substantially water insoluble starch acylonitrile graft copolymer such as that described in U.S. Patent 3,661,815 and commercially available from the Grain Processing Corp., and finely divided substantially water insoluble cross linked dextran such as that commercially available under the trademark Sephadex. Suitably hydratable polymers are gluten and long chain polymers of methyl vinyl ether maleic acid, preferably, the long chain polymers of methyl vinyl ether maleic acid commercially available under the trademark Gantrez from GAF Inc. The maleic acid moiety in the polymer may be intact Gantrez S 97 , may be an anhydride Gantrez AM 169 , or may be a metal salt such as the mixed sodium calcium salts Gantrez AT 955 . Small amounts, i.e., less than 5 by weight, of other ingredients may be included within or sprayed onto the granules. For example, an antioxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisole or butylated hydroxytoluene, a deodorant such as chlorophyllins, or a perfume agent may be included. In addition, small amounts of a pharmacologically active ingredient can be included within or sprayed onto the granules. For example, an antibiotic or antimicrobial agent such as neomycin, an antiseptic agent such as povidone iodine, and an antiinflammatory agent such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone acetonide. The granules preferably contain at least 70 by weight of one or more water dispersable hydrocolloids selected from pectin, gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and collagen with a granular product consisting of an equal weight percent mixture of pectin, gelatin, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose being most preferred. The granular material can be prepared from the powder ingredients by dry compaction, wet granulation, or fluidized bed granulation techniques. The dry compaction method involves blending the component powders, compacting into a slab, and milling the slab to the desired particle size. The milled material is sieved and particles of the proper size range are gathered and packaged. In the wet granulation process, the powders after blending, or simultaneously with blending, are moistened with water, a hydroalcoholic solution, or low concentration dispersion of one or more of the water dispersable hydrocolloids in water or hydroalcoholic vehicles. Normally, the amount of moisture added is up to about 50 of the dry weight of the powders in order to form granules with adequate process ability and resistance to attrition. After thorough mixing, the moistened mass is forced through a screen or die to yield granules directly or to yield by extrusion, a particulate noodle like or ribbon like mass of material. When dried, this material is then milled to the desired sieve size and packaged. Alternatively, the moistened mass may first be broken into large lumps which are then dried and milled to the desired particle size. In the fluid bed granulation procedure, the moistening fluid is added to a charge of the blended powders held suspended on a column of rising warm air where the powders are allowed to mix with the granulating fluid, which is very rapidly evaporated, leaving behind agglomerated granules. Less moistening fluid is required in this process then in the wet granulation process described above. To 120 kg. of a mixture of equal parts of gelatin, pectin and sodium carboxymethylcellulose were added about 50 liters of distilled water or a mixture of water and ethanol. Mixing was performed in a rotating oscillating device to produce a homogeneous blend. The blend was screened through a coarse sieve 0.5 inch 12.7 mm and the moistened material was dried at 55 C for 24 hours. The dried material was milled and screened to between 16 and 20 mesh. Following the procedure of Example 11 but employing the ingredients listed below on a weight percent basis other granular products within the scope of this invention are obtained. The use of the occlusive dressings described above results in a closed moist wound treatment environment. Unlike gauze type dressings, the ingredients employed in adhesive layer 14 permit the dressings of this invention to remain in place over the wound for up to several days. It is believed that the need to frequently change a dressing disturbs the wound healing environment and results in a slower healing process. The water dispersable hydrocolloid materials, distributed throughout adhesive layer 14 react in the presence of moisture. In the area of normal skin surrounding the wound site, the layer 14 will gradually hydrate over a period of days. The initial aggressive bond of the dressing to this normal skin is due to the presence of the pressure sensitive adhesive materials in layer 14 i.e., dry tack. As this bond is lessened by perspiration and leakage of moisture under layer 14, the wet tack of the moisture active ingredients in layer 14 becomes more critical in bonding the dressing to the skin. Eventually, layer 14 becomes so hydrated that the dressing can be removed without stripping or macerating the skin around the wound site. When the dressing is applied over a fluid emitting wound such as a dermal ulcer, it has been observed that the moisture active ingredients in layer 14 will be converted to an almost gel like mass. This provides an ideal moist environment for cell migration ensuring easy dressing removal with a minimum of damage to the newly formed tissues. In treating ulcers emitting a large volume of exudate, it has been found to be useful to first pack the wound with the granular material described above and then cover with the occlusive dressing. The granules interact with the wound exudate to form a gel like mass and prevent leakage through the dressing. As a result, the dressing is changed less often which is believed to result in a shortened healing period. After removal of the dressing, the hydrated granules can be removed from the wound site by flushing with saline solution. As healing progresses and less exudate is present in the sound site, the dressing can be employed without the granular packing. Fig. 7 shows an ulcer 70 covered by occlusive dressing 10. The dressing is partially broken away to show the granular packing material 75. of course, adhesive layer 14 contacts the granules 75 in the area of the wound and also bonds the dressing to the normal skin 71 surrounding the ulcer.
