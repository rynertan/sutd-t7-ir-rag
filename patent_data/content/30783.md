# Automotive transmission shifter and park lock assembly.

## Abstract
An automotive transmission shifter and park lock which includes a base 11 for mounting the shifter in an automo tive vehicle. A shift lever 15 is pivotable with respect to the base and a park lock hook 61 is pivotally mounted on the shift lever. The base includes an aperture 63 to receive the park lock hook although the park lock hook is normally spring biased upwardly out of engagement with the aperture. Means 70 is provided for connecting the lock hook to a park lock cable 67, 68 which is locked by the ignition switch whereby, once the park lock cable is locked stationary by the ignition switch, the park lock hook is automatically pivoted into engagement with the aperture in the base upon an attempt to pivot the shift lever out of the park position. This hook type lock generates the principal locking forces in the shifter itself so that these forces do not have to be provided by the park lock cable.
