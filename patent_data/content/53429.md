# POWER STEERING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A power steering system, particularly advantageous for use on electric powered vehicles, in which the hy draulic pump 14 operates only when steering com mands are given. Torque applied to the steering shaft 20 by rotation of a steering wheel not shown is trans lated to axial stress on a thin walled tube 88 , the direc tion and intensity of which depend on the direction and amount of steer angle change commanded. The axial stresses are detected by strain gauges 130, 132, 134, 136 , and the motor which powers the hydraulic pump 14 is activated only when stress is detected. Manual steering inputs enter the pump 14 on one side, and the powered servo motor 12 inputs enter on the opposite side, thus permitting the vehicle to be steered by manual input alone if the powered input fails. The components of the system are arranged in coaxial alignment, provid ing a compact system with improved heat dissipation qualities.
