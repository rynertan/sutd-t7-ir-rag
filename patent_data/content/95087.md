# Three service wire distributing unit and outlet means therefor.

## Abstract
A metal cellular flooring unit presents at least two enclosed cells separated by a lengthwise trough. A distinct partitioning element substantially coextensive in length with the first cell, divides the first cell into first and second subcells. A set of access openings is provided including distinct crest and web access openings in the crest and one web of the first cell providing access solely to the first and second subcells, respectively and a web access opening in that web of the second cell opposite to web access opening of the first cell, providing access to the second cell. The flooring unit is thereby adapted for separate distribution of the wiring of three different services, such as, computer or like services, telephone and power. Access to all three services is available at each location along the length of the flooring unit at which a set of access openings is provided.
