# Vessel closure having peelable liner and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A vessel closure such as a crown shell or cap shell com prises a coated metal shell having a top portion 7 provided with a skirt 8 and a peelable thermoplastic resin liner 9 on the inner surface of said top portion. In order to overcome problems concerning the peelability of the liner and the for mation of dust which can contaminate, for example, a drink in a container sealed by such a vessel closure, the liner 9 is bonded to the shell by means of a peelable adhesion interface between a layer 3 of a hydrocarbon resin or natural resin which is provided on said inner surface within the periphery of said top portion 7 of the shell, and a layer 4 containing an epoxy resin which is directly in contact with the hydrocarbon resin or natural resin layer 3 .
