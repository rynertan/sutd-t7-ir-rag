# Improvements in the joining of optical fibre cables.

## Abstract
Optical fibre based cables 1 and 2 are jointed by fixing their axial strength members 3 to a perforated connecting member 9. Fibre tails to be joined are stored on the connecting member by winding around guides 16 engageable with perforations 11. Fibre end parts are joined and positioned in ferrules 24 also engaged with perforations 11.
