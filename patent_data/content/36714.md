# Axial flow rotary compressor.

## Abstract
In an axial flow rotary compressor a fluid flow inlet 12 is circumferentially separated from a fluid flow outlet 20 by a dy namic flow splitter 18 comprising at least one toroidal cham ber 27 providing a loop fluid flow path 24 intersecting the path 23 of the rotor blades 2 such that any fluid leakage through the flow splitter flows around the loop flow path 24 . Regeneration of the flow through the rotor blades 2 as they emerge from the flow splitter 18 is thus facilitated. The flow splitter 18 may comprise a number of contiguous chambers 27 31 whose apartures can increase towards the low pres sure end of the flow splitter to compensate for the decreased density of the fluid. The downstream walls 22 of the flow split ter chambers can be offset relative to the upstream walls 21 so as to provide a direct quasihelical fluid flow path through the flow splitter to increase the enthalpy transport through the flow splitter.
