# AUTOMATIC VACUUM LEAK TEST METHOD

## Abstract
A method of automatically testing a steam sterilizer to detect 1 unacceptable air leak rates includes an air removal and system heating step which includes a plurality of pressure vacuum pulses, a stabilization step, a vacuum hold step and an air admission step. Pressure readings are automatically taken at preset times at the beginning and end of the vacuum hold step. The leak rate is automatically calculated by the pressure change over time in the vacuum hold period. The method of the present invention eliminates the need for human intervention, and thus human error, during the progression and critical pressure readings of the test.
