## Description
The inter computer communications field, exemplified by local area networks, is a rapidly expanding area of technology within the larger sphere of information processing. Local area networks provide for the interconnection of two or more computers separated by small to substantial distances ranging, typically, from several meters up to 2 kilometers. Local area networks, however, may do more than just serve as communications links. They may act to make the resources of each participant available to all others. In ring and linear topology networks, for example, a common network media is shared between all of the computers participating in the network. The media itself is often no more than a coaxial cable or the equivalent. Each computer interfaces to the network via a communications node. While each computer may be distinctly different from any other on the network, the communications node fuctions to process raw data from its associated computer into a standardised format, often described as a data packet, and transmit it over the shared media. Data packets are also received by the communications node and provided to its associated computer after processing the packet to recover the raw data. Consequently, cooperative operation and the sharing of resources characterise local area networks. The functional requirements placed on local area networks are numerous and often subject to tradeoffs depending on the particular circumstances involved in the implementation of the network. Some of the functional requirements, however, are relatively universal. While many computers may be participating in the network, only a single computer may be validly transmitting information over the network to one or more receiving computers at a time. Thus, the speed or transmission bandwidth of the network as a whole needs to be as great as possible. Along with high speed, the network itself must be reliable. That is, first, the network must reliably provide for the transfer of data between computers without loss or distortion. Second, the network must be reliable in that, as a shared resource itself, any component failure within a communications node of the system should have a minimal if not undetectable impact on the operation of the network as a whole. Additionally, the cost of the network system, including the network media and the component systems forming each communication node, must be as low as possible, as a practical matter, while still obtaining the necessary speed and reliability of the local area network system. It is therefore a purpose of the present invention to assist the implementation of an inter computer network communication system having all the aforementioned desired qualities. In EP A 0124959 there is disclosed a digital code conversion system for decoding a first stream of encoded data received from an encoded data source, the code conversion system comprising sequence detecting means for detecting a particular sequence of data in the first data stream partitioning means for partitioning the first encoded data stream into a plurality of data stream segments and decoding means for decoding the data stream segments to produce a first uncoded data stream therefrom. According to one aspect of the present invention, such a conversion system is further characterised by alignment means responsive to the sequence detecting means for aligning the partitioning of the data stream segments with respect to the said particular sequence of data and for providing a smash warning signal whenever the partitioning of the data stream segments is changed relative to a last prior occurrence of the said particular sequence the decoding means being responsive to the smash warning signal and altering the decoding of the present occurrence of the particular sequence of data in response to the smash warning signal. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a data receiving and decoding circuit which receives a bit serial stream of data containing encoded data words, the circuit comprising According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an encoder decoder integrated circuit for encoding a data stream from any one of a plurality of unencoded data sources and for decoding a data stream from any one of a plurality of encoded data sources, the circuit comprising According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a data receiving and code conversion system for use in a local area network for converting a received serial bit stream containing a first series of data words and converting the serial first series of data words into a second series of data words, where said first series of data words are represented by a first set of data codes, where said second series of data words are represented by second sets of data codes and where the words of the received serial bit stream are subject to a data misalignment fault condition, said system being characterized by According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a receiving unit for receiving a serial bit stream containing encoded data words of predetermined bit lengths, at least two non consecutive ones of said data words being delimiting words each represented by a unique bit sequence which is distinguishable from the bit sequences of all other words in the received serial bit stream, the receiving unit comprising Thus, the necessary facilities to provide for remote flexible component diagnostic capabilities through the provision of loop back and bypass data stream routing are directly implemented. Moreover, optimal preservation of data packets is obtained by detecting and encoding the packet overlap, or smash, condition in the packet header of the overlapping data packet as it is received. Advantageously, optimal use is made of an asynchronous elastic buffer and its integral overflow underflow condition detection capability. In addition, a condition detection reporting scheme is preferably used that reduces the physical interconnect required to other system component while increasing the flexibility of its component system architecture. A further advantage is that the component system architecture permits close system node integration while retaining a high degree of flexibility for a variety of applications. Yet another advantage is that the system is adaptable to automatically performing network primitive procedures as required in the implementation of high speed local area networks. In the accompanying drawings, by way of example only Fig. 1 illustrates the typical manner of utilizing a local area network node 10 to interconnect a host computer system 16 with a physical network media 34, 36. Typically, the node 10 will include a node controller 14, an encoder decoder, or ENDEC, 12 and an interface unit 18 as integral system components. The host computer 16 typically communicates with the node controller 14 of the node 10 over a bidirectional data bus 28. The node controller 14, in turn, transfers data to and from the ENDEC 12 over the data busses 24, 26, respectively. In addition, the node controller 14 controls and determines the status of the ENDEC 12 by means of the control bus 22. A system clock, The ENDEC 12 functions to prepare the raw transmitter data provided by the node controller 14 for transmission to the interface system component 18 over the serial data bus 30 and, subsequently, onto the network media 34. The ENDEC 12 further functions to recover data received from the network media 36 via the interface system component 18 and the serial data bus 32. This recovered data is then transferred to the node controller 14 over the return data bus 26. The interface system component 18 functions to provide a physical interconnect between the node 10 and network media 34, 36. As such, the interface 18 may simply be a coaxial T connector, for example. Depending on the nature of the network media 34, 36, however, the interface may perform a more complex function. Where the media 34, 36 is an optical fiber communications cable, the interface 18 also preferably includes an electro optic transmitter and receiver. Finally, the network media 34, 36 itself is preferably only a passive single high speed serial data bus that physically interconnects each of the nodes 10. The topology of the network, i.e., ring, redundant loop, or linear, is thus established by how the nodes are interconnected, in terms of nearest neighbor relationships, by the physical network media. There are a number of somewhat different networking protocols, or systematic procedures of operation, that may be implemented to control the overall operation of the network. A design choice in the assemblage of the network is the selection of one of these protocols for implementation. One exemplary protocol, and the one preferably implemented in a network utilizing the present invention, is a token passing, ring topology network protocol wherein communication between nodes is by means of data packets. A general description and discussion of this protocol and its principles of operation as well as other conventional protocols may be had by reference to New Standards for Local Networks Push Upper Limits for Light Wave Data , S. Joshi et al., In brief, the exemplary protocol calls for the ordered access of each node to the entire network. A node having the right to access the network, i.e., the current token holder, may initialize a network communication sequence wherein a number of data packets are exchanged with one or more other network nodes. At the conclusion of the communication sequence, the token is passed to the next successive node of the network. Another communication sequence may then be initiated by the token holder. Typically, the data packets are themselves only a part of a continuous data stream that traverses the network. As will be described in greater detail below, each packet includes a header portion, a data body portion, and a trailer portion. The packets may be separated from one another in the data stream by a filler code that acts to maintain status communication between all of the nodes by reflecting the line state of the network even though no data packets are being transferred. The most primitive or basic protocol functions performed by a node include recognizing the current line state of the network and asserting requests with respect to the line state. The present system provides an encoder decoder component system fully capable of performing all of the required functions of an ENDEC 12 in a local area network node. Accordingly, Fig. 2 provides a block diagram of the preferred embodiment of an ENDEC 12 consistent with the present invention. The ENDEC 12 includes two major subsections 12 In greater detail, the ENDEC 12 may receive two separate parallel data streams, T In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the encoder 62 implements a 4B 5B encoding scheme wherein each high and low order nibble of the data byte is encoded in combination with its respective control data bit to provide 2 five bit code symbols. Table I sets forth each unencoded data nibble, as well as its preferred corresponding encoded bit group and code symbol assignment. Preferably each data packet header includes a JK code symbol pair as a start delimiter followed by a data body of data code symbols, further followed by a trailer beginning with a terminator code symbol and, optionally, a following control symbol. The filler portion of the data stream between data packets is itself simply a sequence of line state symbols that appropriately indicate the current status of the network medium. The encoder 62, in the process of encoding each data byte also regenerates a parity bit that is then compared to the parity bit supplied with the original parallel data word to determine whether an error has occurred in the transfer of the parallel word from at least the node controller node 14 to the ENDEC 12. The parity error, if present, is reported back to the node controller 14 over the control bus line 22₄. The encoded data is passed via the encoded data word bus 88 to a selector circuit 34 where, nominally, it is further passed via the parallel bus 92 to the serial shift register 66. As will be described in greater detail below, the CMT unit 56 may direct, via selector control lines 90 that the selector 64 generate and select line state and, possibly, error code symbols for subsequent transmission. In any case, the code symbols received by the serial shift register 66 are parallel to serial converted in response to a transmitter clock signal CTx provided by the clock unit 54 over clock line 94. The serialized data provided by the serial shift register 66 is further converted by a conventional non return to Zero invert on ones NRZI converter 68 to the corresponding preferred serial format. The resulting NRZI data is then provided to the AND gate 42 via the serial data line 96. The serial data stream is preferably further converted to a conventional differential signal by the AND gate 42 and provided on the serial data line pair 30 to the interface system component 18 for transmission. The receiver subsection 12 The buffer 50 is preferably of a type generally known as an elastic buffer. Such buffers typically include a buffer memory and provide for the asynchronous reading and writing of data contained therein. Thus, variations in the rates at which data is received written into the buffer and subsequently read out may be tolerated. The buffer 50 preferably also includes a phase lock loop and data separator circuit to reconstruct separately the data and a received data clock signal CRx from the received NRZI data stream. The received data clock signal CRx corresponds to the transmitter clock signal of the node 10 transmitting the data currently being received, and is used to synchronize the writing of received data into the buffer memory of the buffer 50. The buffer 50 also receives the transmitter clock signal CTx from the clock unit 54 over line 80 to synchronize the reading of data from the buffer 50 with the remainder of the receiver subsection of the ENDEC 12. The received data, as it is read from the buffer 50, is provided to the decode unit 52 over the serial data line 72. As will be discussed in greater detail below, this serial data is also passed to the CMT unit 56 for monitoring of the current line state. The decode unit 52, synchronous with the data read from the buffer 50, reconstructs parallel encoded data words from the serial data stream. The decode unit 50 then sequentially decodes each of them to provide a stream of decoded 11 bit wide parallel data words on the parallel received data bus 74. The parallel decoded data stream is in turn provided to the multiplexer 44 as one input thereto. Two additional parallel data word inputs to the multiplexer 44 are obtained from the two transmitter lines 24 The CMT unit 56 of the ENDEC 12 is itself directly controlled by the node controller 14 via the CMTIN lines 22₃, the bypass loop control lines 22₅ and the transmitter A B source select line 22₇. The CMTIN control lines 22₃ permit the node controller 14 to specify to the CMT unit 56 that it is to operate the selector 64 of the ENDEC 12 so as to implement specific primitive local area network protocols to establish the node 10 as, for example, a peer, master or slave unit. The status of the CMT unit 56, as well as the line state of the network as perceived by the CMT unit 56, is reported back to the node controller 14 via the CMTOUT lines 22₂. The CMTIN control lines 22₃ also permit the node controller 14 to functionally disable the CMT unit 56 so that no primitive protocols are implemented. The nature and purpose of the preferred primitive protocols, as well as the operation of the CMT unit 56, will be described in greater detail below. The bypass loop control lines 22₅, transmitter A B source select line 22₇ and the connector control line 22₁ together permit the node controller 14 to select the data stream paths through both the transmit and receive subsections 12 Further, the node controller 14 may elect to allow another node of the local area network to evaluate the operation of the ENDEC 12 and all the intervening components of the network. That is, the node controller 14 may select via the bypass loop back control lines 22₅ to configure the multiplexer 46 to select the decoded receive parallel data from the decode unit 52 to be passed by the multiplexer 46 as the parallel data to be encoded, serialized and subsequently retransmitted onto the network media. In this manner, large sections of the network can be evaluated so as to determine those elements that, for example, contribute to the progressive degradation of data as it s passed through the corresponding section of the network. Referring now to Fig. 3, the preferred implementation of the buffer 50 and decode unit 52 are shown. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the serial received data stream provided on line 70 by the multiplexer 40 is a non differential serial signal containing non return to zero invert on ones encoded data. Thus, to recover the data from the serial data stream provided, a conventional data separator 100 and receiver phase lock loop 102 are employed. A reference frequency, As generally indicated above, the data stream containing data packets may be received by the ENDEC 12 at a rate that differs by a small but significant amount from the transmit clock signal CTx as directly derived from the system clock The length of the linear memory array of the buffer array 110 is effectively made infinite by specifying that the counters of both the write pointer 102 and read pointer 112 are reset to zero as they are respectively clocked past pointing at the last memory cell of the buffer array. However, where there is too great a disparity in the rates of reading and writing data from and to the buffer array 110, an overflow underflow condition occurs. That is, both the write pointer 102 and read pointer 112 effectively point to the same memory cell of the buffer array 110 resulting in a compromise of data integrity. While the particularly preferred manner of detecting the imminent occurrence of the overflow underflow condition will be described below, it is sufficient for purposes of the present invention merely that the elastic buffer 108, 110, 112 detects this condition and provides an appropriate overflow underflow OvUd signal on line 150 to the decoder 52. The serial data stream, as synchronized by the buffer array 110 to the ENDEC transmitter clock signal CTx, is provided over line 72 to the decode unit 52. Preferably, the decode unit 52 includes a comparator 114, serial to parallel shift register 116, a receiver control unit 118, a register 120, and, finally, a decoder 122. In greater detail, the serial data stream including data packets is serially clocked from the buffer array 110 into the shift register 116 in response to the transmitter clock signal CTx pulses provided on line 80. As the encoded data words of the data stream are ten bits long in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shift register 115 is correspondingly ten bits wide. The comparator 114 has, as one input thereto, the single data bit present on the serial data line 72 during each cycle of the transmitter clock signal CTx. The nine low order bits simultaneously present in the shift register 116 are also provided to the comparator 114 by the partial parallel shift register output comparator input bus 152. Thus, the comparator 114 samples a full ten bit wide data word during each transmitter clock cycle, one clock cycle prior to the equivalent word being fully shifted into the shift register 116. The comparator 114 thus preferably compares the encoded potential data word presented to it with the code equivalent of the start delimiter JK code symbol pair. Detection of the JK symbol code pair by the comparator 114 is significant in that it signals the imminent presence of a known data word properly aligned in the shift register 116. Upon detecting a JK code symbol pair, the comparator 114 provides a detect signal over line 154 to the receiver control unit 118. The receiver control unit 118 itself preferably includes a bit counter whose capacity corresponds to the bit length of the encoded data words and counts in response to each cycle of the transmitter clock signal CTx, as provided on line 80. Reception of the JK detect signal from the comparator 114 causes the receive control unit 118 to reinitialize its bit counter and to issue a latch enable signal to the register 120 over line 160 during the next transmitter clock cycle. This has the desired effect of latching the properly aligned full ten bit wide data word present in the shift register 116 as provided over the parallel data bus 158, into register 120. Subsequent serial data words are partitioned in alignment with their preceding JK code symbol data word by the receiver control unit 118. That is, the bit counter of the receive control unit 118 cycles to its full capacity count as each data word is serially shifted into the shift register 116 and into alignment with its preceding JK code symbol pair. The bit counter then preferably self resets and causes the receive control unit 118 to issue its latch enable signal on line 160. Thus, the serial data stream is successively partitioned into encoded parallel data words and successively passed to the register 120 and the decoder 122. An error condition particular to local area networks arises when data packets are transmitted onto the network such that they overlap one another. This condition is generally referred to as a collision or smash condition. In accordance with the present invention, a potential smash condition is detected by the receiver control unit 118 whenever a JK code symbol pair detect signal is received from the comparator 114 yet the bit counter of the receive control unit 118 is not at its capacity count. This indicates that the currently detected JK code symbol pair is out of alignment with the JK code symbol pair last previously processed through the decode unit 52. In response, the receive control unit 118 issues a smash condition detected signal over line 156 to the register 120, reinitializes its bit counter to adjust the partitioning of data words into alignment with the presently detected JK code symbol pair and enables register 120 to latch in the smash condition as a separate bit in the register 120 along with the JK code symbol pair. The state of the overflow underflow OvUd signal, as provided on line 150, is also latched into the register 120 as a further parallel bit therein. The register 120 provides its latched data word of code, data or line state symbols to the decode 122 by way of the parallel data word bus 158 . Similarly, the overflow underflow and smash condition error bits are passed to the decoder 122 over the bit lines 150 , 156 , respectively. The decoder 122, in turn, decodes its inputs, preferably in accordance with Table I. That is, the high and low order five bits of the encoded data word are decoded to their respective unencoded binary nibbles and provided on the parallel data bus 160. Their respective decoded control data indicators are provided on their respective high and low order control data bit lines 164, 166. Finally, the decoder 122 further generates a parity bit corresponding to the value of the decoded data byte and provides it on the parity bit line 162. Consequently, the desired parallel data stream is reconstructed by the decoder 122 and provided on the parallel received data bus 74 and, as earlier noted, provided to the multiplexer 44, as shown in Fig. 2. The decoder 122 advantageously further functions to ultimately provide the node controller 14 with an direct indication of the occurrence of both the overflow underflow and smash error conditions. That is, the decoder 122 alters the otherwise normal decoding of the encoded data word provided on parallel data bus 158 whenever an error data bit is provided on the error bit lines 150 , 156 . In particulars the decoder 122 effectively abandons the decoding of the encoded data word whenever the overflow underflow error bit is present. Instead the decoder 122 effectively decodes a pair of physical invalid error symbols and provides the corresponding parallel decoded data word on the parallel data bus 74. That is, the decoder 132 provides high and low order nibbles F , F hex with both control data bits 1, thus indicating that the integrity of the data in the current data packet has been compromised and should be ultimately abandoned by the node controller 14. Similarly, the decoder 122 alters its decoding of the encoded JK code symbol pair when the smash condition bit is provided on the error bit line 156 . Instead of decoding the JK code symbol pair to the binary high and low order nibbles C and 3 hex with both control data bits 1, the decoder 122 preferably decodes the smash JK or J physical invalid condition as high and low order nibbles E and 3 hex with both control data bits 1. Consequently, the decoded data word ultimately provides the node controller 14 with the specific information that both a smash condition has occurred and a new data packet is now being received. This is significant in that it allows the node controller to effectively abandon the overlapped and, therefore, incomplete data packet while being properly informed that a new and potentially error free data packet is being transferred from the ENDEC 12. Further significantly, the effective encoding of the smash condition into the otherwise decoded JK code symbol pair equivalent relieves the need to provide an additional physical interconnect control line between the ENDEC 12 and the node controller 14, thus simplifying the physical interface between the two system components without loss of function or flexibility. As noted above, a conventional elastic buffer may be utilized to perform the functions of the write pointer 108, buffer array 110, and read pointer 112. However, the preferred design of the elastic buffer 108, 110, 112 is detailed in Figs. 4 7. In particular, the principal elements of the buffer array 110 are shown in Fig. 4. The cell array 200 of the buffer array 110 is preferably a linear array of separately addressable cell units 200 For the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cell array 200 preferably has a minimum length sufficient to progressively buffer an entire data packet that is simultaneously written to and read from the cell array 200 while tolerating the greatest disparity acceptable between the serial data stream receive and transmit clock rates CRx, CTx. Thus, for an exemplary data packet consisting of 9,000 code symbols or 45,000 serial bits in length , a transmitter clock signal CTx base frequency of 125mhz with a tolerance value specified at 0.005 percent and, therefore, a maximum CTx to CRx frequency variance of 0.01 percent, the cell array 200 must provide for an elasticity of 4.5 serial data bits minimum. In practical terms, this translates into an elastic buffer cell array 200 having a minimum of ten cell units 200 In operation, the write pointer 108 of Fig. 3 is initialized by an INITWp signal provided by the control circuitry of Fig. 7 on control line 146. The binary counter of the writer pointer 108 is accordingly reset. As serial data is received by the buffer array 110 on the DI line 136, the binary counter of the write pointer 108 sequentially increments the write pointer count provided to the buffer array 110 via the pointer lines 144. That is, the count of the write pointer 108 is incremented with each cycle of the receive clock signal CRx as provided on the line 142 and is, therefore, synchronous with the provision of the serial data to the buffer array 110 on the DI line 136. Referring again to Fig. 4, the writer pointer count is provided via the write count lines 144 to the write cell unit selector 204. Preferably, this selector 204 is a binary 4 to 16 line decoder with each of its 16 output lines 218 connected to a respective cell unit 200 Considering again Fig. 3, the buffer array 110 and the read pointer 112 operate similarly to provide for the reading of data from the cell array 200. The binary counter of the read pointer 112 is at least initially reset in response to the INITRp signal provided on the control line 140 by the control circuitry of Fig. 7. Subsequently, the binary count increments in response to the transmitter clock signal CTx as provided on the clock line 80. Again referring to Fig. 4, the binary read pointer count is provided to the buffer array 110 on the read count lines 142. In particular, the read count is provided to the read cell unit selector 210, preferably including a conventional 16 to 1 multiplexer circuit. The respective DOx Referring again to Fig. 5, detection of overflow underflow conditions during the operation of the buffer array 110 is accomplished through the use of a flag cell 242 provided in each respective cell unit 200 For a given unit cell 200 A write overflow condition will arise whenever the memory cell 240 of a cell unit 200 A read underflow condition is detected in a similar manner. Referring first to Fig. 4, the read pointer count as provided on lines 142 is provided to a read selector 206 and read selector 208 in addition to the read cell unit selector 210. The read selector 206 and read selector 208 both also preferably include 4 to 16 line decoder circuits. The three read selectors, however, are distinguished in that for a given read pointer count, the selectors 206, 208, 210 will select three consecutive cell units 200 Referring again to Fig. 5, selection of the cell unit 200 The read selector 206, in contrast, adjusts the status of the flag cell 242 of the cell unit 200 Accordingly, the minimum number of cell units in the cell array 200 must be increased by two over the number previously determined to be required. In the example above for the case of the preferred embodiment, the minimum number becomes twelve. However, for simplicity of construction in view of the use of 4 bit write and read pointer counters, the preferred number of cell units 200 A significant virtue of the preferred overflow underflow detection scheme described above is that it avoids metastable logic state conditions. That is, in conventional elastic buffers, an overflow underflow condition may not be detected until the same cell unit is addressed for both reading and writing. There are, however, finite propagation and settling times associated with signals in all electronic circuits. Until all relevant signals have propagated and settled, the combinatorial output of logic gates affected may not properly reflect the input conditions of the circuit. Relevant to the function of an elastic buffer, metastable states may result in the reading and writing of incorrect data as well as the improper detection or failure to detect overflow underflow conditions. This metastable state problem is completely avoided through the use of the preferred embodiment of the present invention by stipulating the detection of an overflow underflow condition prior to its actual occurrence. Metastable states are of concern whenever a logic circuit must deal with asynchronous event inputs. The control circuitry, as shown in Fig. 7, must deal with the asynchronous occurrence of the cell array overflow underflow signal as provided on line 352 of Fig. 4, as well as a normal operating condition that causes the initialization of the cell array 200 and the provision of a reset signal on line 22₅ by the node controller 14. Consequently, the synchronization circuit shown in Fig. 6 is utilized in the control circuit of Fig. 7 to prevent the propagation of metastable states and resulting improper circuit operation. The synchronization circuit 300 of Fig. 6 utilizes OR gate 302 and AND gate 304 to latch an input signal provided on the A input line 310. Considering an initial state where no input signal is provided on the input line 310 and the a logic zero is present on the feedback line 314 that connects the output of the AND gate 304 to an input of the OR gate 302, a logic zero will be present on the OR AND 302, 304 interconnecting line 316 resulting in a stable logic condition with respect to the OR and AND gates 302, 304. An extended clock signal Cx₂₄ is provided on line 133 as the clock input to two series connected D flip flops 306, 308. For purposes of the present invention, this extended clock signal Cx₂₄ preferably has a period three times longer yet otherwise synchronous with the clock signal CTx, CRx from which it is derived. The output of the AND gate 304 is provided as the input to the D flip flops 306 that, in turn, provides its output on line 318 to the input of the second D flip flop 308. At least initially, the data content of the two flip flops 306, 308 are logic zeros resulting in the feedback of a logic one signal on line 320 from the complement output second D flip flop 308 to an input of the AND gate 304. Transition of the input signal on line 310 from a logic zero to a logic one results in the latching of the logic one as between the OR gate 302 and AND gate 304 at least until the logic state of the feedback signal provided to the AND gate 304 on line 320 changes. The output of the AND gate 304, however, is not clocked into the first D flip flop 306 until the beginning of the next delayed clock signal Cx₂₄. Thus, the input signal on line 310 of the synchronizer 300 is provided a substantial time window to allow full decay or setting of a metastable state at the output of the AND gate 304. Consequently, the synchronizer 300 permits an input signal on line 310, though delayed by preceding logic stages and a potential phase difference between the receive and transmit clocks CRx, CTx, as well as the propagation and settling delay of the OR AND latch 302, 304, to settle such that it is quite unlikely that a metastable condition will exist at the output of the AND gate 304 when the extended clock signal Cx₂₄ on line 133 clocks in the data present at the input of the D flip flop 306. Further, the output of the flip flop 306 is allowed the full period of the extended clock signal Cx₂₄ to settle precluding the possibility of propagating a metastable state to the output of the synchronizer circuit 300. In the immediately subsequent extended clock cycle, the data output of the D flip flop 306 is gated into the second D flip flop 308 and made available on its output line 312. Simultaneously, the complementary output signal provided on line 320 resets the OR AND latch circuit 302, 304. Consequently, while introducing a delay of slightly greater than one transmitter clock cycle, the synchronizer circuit 300 effectively blocks the propagation of metastable states between its input and output. Considering now Fig. 7, the control circuitry as shown performs a variety of functions including initializing the read and write pointers 108, 112, resetting the flag cells 242 of the cell array 200 and insuring that the overflow underflow condition detect signal provided on line 150 is only issued when a data packet is in transit through the buffer array 110. Subcircuit 340 of the control circuit of Fig. 7 controls the issuance of the overflow underflow signal on line 150 depending on the data status of the memory cells 240 of the cell array 200. Two particular status conditions are of significance. The first is where all of the memory cells 240 of the cell array 200 contain logic ones corresponding, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, to the reception of a string of more than four idle line state symbols from the network media. The second status condition is where all of the memory cells 240 of the cell array 200 contain logic zeroes corresponding to the reception, again in the preferred embodiment, of more than four quiet line state symbols from the network media. Both the idle and quite line state symbols are defined in Table I and their use will be described in greater detail below. Subcircuit 340 receives the data from all the memory cells 240 of the cell array 200 on their respective data out lines 224. These data out signals and their complements are utilized by the OR circuit 342 to produce an elastic buffer idle EBIDLE signal on line 346 whenever all of the data output lines 224 are at a logic one and an elastic buffer quiet EBQUIET signal on line 348 whenever all of the data output lines 224 are at logic zero. The invert of these two signals and the cell array overflow underflow O U signal on line 352 are combined by the AND circuit 344 such that the output signal on line 350 is a logic one whenever the data present in the memory cells 240 of the cell array 200 are not representative of either an idle or quiet line state and an overflow underflow condition is detected within any cell unit 200 Subcircuit 354 provides for the initialization of the write pointer 108 and cell array 200 as a new data packet is serially received on the DI line 136, the temporary disabling of the overflow underflow condition detection capability of the cell units 200 Subcircuit 390 is provided to provide a delayed reset signal to the OR gate 372 of subcircuit 354. This delayed reset signal is generated in response to a reset signal RS on line 22₅ as provided by the node controller 14. The D flip flop 392 clocks in the state of the reset line 22₅ in response to the receiver clock signal provided on line 132 thereto. The inverted output of the D flip flop 392 is provided on line 402 to the OR gate 394, having as its other input the state of the reset signal on line 22₅, which delays the application of the reset signal via line 358 until after the reset signal is relinquished. The delayed reset signal is then applied by the OR gate 394 for the remaining portion of the current receiver clock period to the OR gate 374 of subcircuit 354. Since the reset signal is provided by line 22₅ as an additional input to the OR gate 380 of subcircuit 354, the DISEBR signal on line 214 is asserted directly in response to the reset signal on line 22₅. However, application of the reset is effectively maintained by the operation of the subcircuit 390 until the conclusion of the current receiver clock cycle regardless of the asynchronous withdrawal of the reset signal by the node controller 14. Subcircuit 400 provides for the ultimate issuance of the DISEBR signal on line 214 of subcircuit 354 in response to an overflow underflow condition as asynchronously detected by any of the cell units 200 Finally, subcircuit 410 functions to delay the initialization of the read pointer 112 for a period sufficient to allow the write pointer 108 to direct the writing of the minimum required number of serial data bits necessary to provide the desired elasticity in the buffer array 110. That is, the INITEB signal on line 146 occurring in response to the initial detection of a new data packet is provided to the synchronization circuit 300₃ where it is synchronized at least with respect to the extended transmitter clock signal CTx₂₄. The output of the synchronization circuit 300₃ is further synchronized by the D flip flop 413 and the AND gate 414, similar to the respective components of the subcircuit 400, with the transmitter clock signal CTx. The resulting signal is provided by the AND gate 414 on its output line 426 to the three serially connected D flip flops 416, 418, 420. The output of the last D flip flop 420 in turn provides the read pointer initialize signal INITRp on line 140 to the counter of the read pointer 112 as shown in Fig. 3. Note that the synchronization circuit 300₃ and the D flip flops 413, 416, 418, 420 combine to provide a total delay of six transmitter clock signal periods between the initialization of the write pointer 108 and the read pointer 112. Thus, the necessary elasticity of the buffer array 110 is established by the operation of the subcircuit 410. An ancillary function of subcircuit 410 is performed by the set reset flip flop 422. This flip flop 422 is set in response to the buffer array OvUd signal on line 150 and reset in response to the INITRp signal on line 140. The output of the flip flop 422 provides a data state force FRCE on line 228 to the read selector circuit 210 of Fig. 4 The purpose of this FRCE signal is to disable the read selector 210 for the period of time following a buffer array overflow underflow condition is detected until the initialization of the buffer array 110 is completed as signified by the occurrence of the INITRp signal on line 140. Consequently, serial data provided on the DO line 72 following an overflow underflow condition but prior to full initialization of the buffer array 110 will be forced to a logical one corresponding to an idle line state condition. The significant waveform timing relationships of the control circuits shown in Fig. 7 are illustrated in Fig. 8. As shown, the occurrence of the cell array O U signal during transmitter clock cycles T₁ T₂ results in the occurrence of the buffer array OvUd during cycle T₃ synchronous with the transmitter clock signal CTx₂₄. The DISEBR and INITEB INITWp signals will also be asserted at this time. In response to the INITEB signal in particular, the INITRp signal is asserted six clock periods later, in clock period T₉ synchronous with the transmitter clock signal CTx. In turn, the FRCE signal, activated in clock period T₄ by the OvUd signal synchronous with the transmitter signal CTx, is reset at the beginning of cycle T₁₀ in response to the INITRp signal. The clock unit 54, as shown in Fig. 3, may be of conventional design. Preferably, however, the clock unit 54 includes a clock phase lock loop circuit 104 and a clock counter circuit 106. The clock phase lock loop circuit 104 receives the system clock signal Referring to Fig. 2, the command management unit CMT 56 preferably is a low complexity, otherwise conventional state machine that is responsive to the serial data provided by line 72, the CMTIN signals provided on control lines 22₃ and the bypass loop back control signals provided on the control lines 22₅. In response to these inputs, the CMT unit 56 provides multiplexer control signals on lines 82 status output signals on the CMTOUT lines 22₂ and selector control signals on the control lines 90 to the selector 64. These later control signals provide for selecting between the nominal parallel data provided on the data bus 89 and particular control symbols such as quiet, idle and halt. The state diagram of the state machine implemented the CMT unit 56 in the preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown in Fig. 9. The CMT unit 56 is utilized to cycle the ENDEC 12 through a number of discrete states by the invocation of certain primitive protocols of the preferred local area network protocol. Upon initialization of the ENDEC 12, the CMT unit 56 is in a zero or listen state as indicated in Fig. 9. As noted above, the node controller 14 may direct the CMT unit 56 to execute the primitive protocols to become active on the local area network as a peer, master or slave unit with respect to the other nodes on the network. Thus, the CMT unit 56 receives its initial state change request from the node controller 14 via the CMTIN lines 22₃. In response to a node controller 14 state change request that, for example, the ENDEC 12 act as a peer unit, the CMT unit 56 begins executing a primitive protocol to establish itself on the network. In response, controlling the ENDEC 12 issues a series of halt line state symbols onto the network. At the beginning of this transmission, a dedicated timer within the CMT unit 56 is initialized to establish a maximum timeframe within which the preferred protocol stipulates that a specific reply must be received in order for the CMT unit 56 to cycle out of the current state and into its target state. Thus, the CMT unit 56 may issue a series of halt line state symbols and, prior to the time out of the dedicated timer, begin receiving halt line state symbols from the network. The CMT unit 56, receives any line state symbols returned by the network via serial line 72. Reception of halt line state symbols, results in a transition to the state one or disabled state of operation. The CMT unit 56 will then reinitialize the dedicated timer and select idle line state symbols for transmission onto the network. If idle line state symbols are in turn received, then the CMT unit 56 will cycle forward the enabled state, as indicated in Fig. 9. At this point, the ENDEC 12 has succeeded in executing the primitive protocols necessary to become active as a peer node on the local area network. The condition or state of the CMT unit 56 is preferably reported continuously to the node controller 14 via the CMTOUT control lines 22₂. Should the CMT unit 56, at any time, detect the transmission of quiet line state symbols over the local area network, the CMT unit 56 will immediately cycle from its current state back to the zero or listen state. With this transition, the state of the CMTOUT status lines 22₂ will be appropriately modified. Preferably, the CMTOUT status lines further indicate the status of the CMT unit 56 with regard to whether it has failed to obtain a proper acknowledgement of the node 10 presence on the local area network. That is, in response to the issuance of halt line state symbols, only quiet line state symbols were received until the time out of the dedicated CMT unit timer. As indicated in Fig. 9, these particular circumstances correspond to a transition to the broken state 4. Also as shown in Fig. 9, the preferred CMT unit 56 state machine permits transitions from any lower state to any higher state, including the master state three. The master state three is obtained by the CMT unit 56 in response to an appropriate request from the node controller 14 on the CMTIN lines 22₃. Preferably, the select circuit 64 generates and selects an alternating sequence of halt and idle line state symbols for transmission onto the network. In turn, reception of master line state symbols, i.e., the same alternating sequence of halt and idle line state symbols, from the network permits the CMT unit 56 to cycle forward to the master state three. Any subsequent reception of halt line symbols will cause the CMT unit 56 operating in the master state three to cycle back to its disabled state one or enabled state two. Should quiet line state symbols be received, however, the CMT unit 56, preferably, will cycle from the master state three directly back to the listen state zero. The preferred operation of the CMT unit 56 of the ENDEC 12 in accordance with the above description, thus operates in accordance with at least the proposed physical layer standard protocol established by the American National Standard Committee, Technical Committee X3T9.5 as of June 1, 1984 and set forth in Rev. 5 of its draft report of the same date. Thus, an ENDEC component system architecture having extensive flexible component diagnostic capabilities, a unique and optimal manner of preserving communication data packets while simultaneously establishing a smash error condition and, further, makes optimal use of a particularly preferred and synchronous elastic buffer that is optimally insensitive to metastable logic conditions has been described.
