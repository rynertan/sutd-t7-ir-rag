## Description
This invention relates to the use of purified lipoteichoic acids hereafter referred to as LTA for the preparation of a medical preparation for the induction of TNF. LTA is a group of amphipathic substances found in gram positive bacterial cells. LTA consists of a polymer chain of polyglycerophosphate PGP as a backbone structure and glycolipids of cytoplasmic membrane origin A.J. Wicken et al., Biological Properties of Lipoteichoic Acids, Electronmicroscopic analysis by ferritin labelled antibody technique reveals that the one end of the LTA is linked to cytoplasmic membrane glycolipid while the other end of the LTA extends to the cell outer surface of the bacteria through the cell wall peptidoglycan layer. Examples of gram positive bacteria having LTA are those belonging to such genera as LTA has not been fully studied with respect to its immunopharmacological activities. In particular, the use of LTA for treatment of tumor patients has never been reported. The present inventors have found that LTA has valuable therapeutic properties, especially an excellent antitumor activity without causing any side effects in animals. Fig. 1 shows the antitumor activity of LTA in Example 1. Fig. 2 shows the antitumor activity of LTA in Example 2. Partial structural differences of LTA do not have serious influence on its biological activities. Thus LTA from any species or genera of gram positive bacteria has good possibility to serve as an antitumor agent of the present invention. For example, LTA obtained from Examples of bacterial strains having such LTA and which may be used in the present invention are as follows The preparation of LTA from whole cells, or a cell envelope fraction of these bacteria may be obtained, for example, according to the method described by Beachey et al. Infect. Immun., LTA is soluble in both water and a lipophilic medium because of its amphipathic property. Therefore, it can be formulated by a conventional formulation process into any desired form such as an oral agent or a parentheral agent containing a desired amount of the active ingredient. Examples of carriers which may be used for formulating such agents are crystalline cellulose, corn starch, sugars such as glucose and lactose, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate. In general, for good antitumor effects to be obtained in man, 0.1 100 mg, preferably 1 20 mg of LTA is administered to an adult as a daily dosage unit in the agent of the present invention. The crude LTA was dissolved in 0.2 M ammonium acetate at a concentration of 50 mg dry weight ml, which was then applied to a gel filtration column 2.6 x 87 cm of Sepharose 6B Pharmacia Co., Sweden and was fractionated with 0.2 M ammonium acetate as an eluant, whereby the crude LTA was purified. Each effluent was monitored by its activity to sensitize sheep red blood cells SRBC to be agglutinated by anti PGS serum, and by a colorimetric determination of phosphorus to determine the localization of LTA. Groups of 5 female, 6 week old BALB c mice purchased from Charles River Japan Inc., Japan were transplanted at the abdominal region intradermally with a suspension of Meth A fibrosarcoma cells 2 x 10⁵ mouse . LTA obtained in the Preparation Example was dissolved in physiological saline and 0.2 ml of the solution was intraperitoneally administered daily for four successive days from the day after the tumor inoculation. Mice of the control group were administered with physiological saline 0.2 ml in place of the LTA solution. To evaluate antitumor activity, tumor size was determined in terms of The result is shown in Fig. 1. A significant anti tumor effect was observed 22 days after the transplantation in the group administered with 10 µg and 2 µg of LTA. Groups of 5 mice of the same strain as used in Example 1 were transplanted in their peritoneal cavities with 2 x 10⁵ cells of Meth A fibrosarcoma. LTA solution obtained in the preparation Example was administered into mice in the same method as described in Example 1. The anti tumor effect was expressed by the following formula As shown in Fig. 2, the anti tumor effect of LTA was definitely observed in mice with ascites type of Meth A fibrosarcoma. In addition, two out of five mice in each of the test groups which were given the injection of 10 µg or 50 µg of LTA were still surviving 60 days after the tumor inoculation, while all mice in the control group died within 24 days. Anti tumor effect was studied as described in Example 1 using LTA which was obtained from The chemical composition of the LTA is shown in Table 1. The foregoing Examples 1 3 clearly show the definite anti tumor effect of LTA. As one of the approaches to studying the mechanism of the anti tumor effect of LTA, the present inventors have examined a possible activity of LTA to induce tumor necrotizing factor TNF , and have found that LTA is a potent inducer of TNF as described in Example 4. TNF is a substance found in the serum of LPS treated animals which had been primed by previous injection of B.C.G. or A group of 8 female, 5 week old ICR mice purchased from Charles River Japan Inc. were given an intraperitoneal injection of formalin killed cells 1.5 mg mouse of On the 11th day, the mice received an intravenous injection of LTA 100 µg mouse obtained in the Preparation Example. Two hours later, the mice were bled and a serum was prepared by a conventional method. Serum specimens were prepared also from groups treated only with A suspension of L 929 cell 1 x 10⁵ cells ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 FCS fetal calf serum was distributed in a microplate having 96 wells 80 µl well , and the cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5 CO₂ air. Then 100 µl of the TNF sample obtained in above 1 which was serially 5 fold diluted with an RPMI 1640 medium containing FCS and 20 µl ³H thymidine solution 1 µC The medium was discarded after 48 hours and the L 929 cells were collected with a cell harvester after being released from the plate by trypsin EDTA method so as to enable the radioactivity c.p.m. of ³H thymidine uptaken in the cells to be counted. The cytotoxic effect of streptococcal LTA induced TNF on L 929 cells in terms of the activity to inhibit thymidine uptake is shown in Table 2. Several other mouse tumor cell lines were examined for their susceptibility to the cytotoxic effect of LTA induced TNF in the same system as described above. The results are shown in Table 3. A suspension of L 929 cells 1 x 10⁵ cells ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 FCS was distributed in a microplate having 24 wells 0.5 ml well , and the cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37 C under 5 CO₂ air. Then, to the cells in each well was added 0.5 ml of the TNF sample obtained in above 1 diluted 1 100 with RPMI 1640 containing 10 FCS. The culture was then continued for a further 48 hours. At the end of the cultivation, the numbers of viable and dead cells in the medium and in the cell suspension released from the microplate by trypsin EDTA method were counted under a phase contrast microscope. Necrosis of tumor mass caused by LTA induced TNF was studied according to the method of Carswell et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 72 9 , 3666 3670, 1975 . A group of 4 female, 5 week old BALB c mice Charles River Japan Inc. were given an intradermal implantation of 2 x 10⁵ cells mouse of Meth A fibrosarcoma. Seven days after the transplantation, when the tumor mass reached 7 8 mm in diameter, 0.3 ml of the TNF sample obtained in above 1 was injected twice from the tail vein at a time interval of 3 hours. Twenty four hours after the second administration, necrosis of the tumor was evaluated by the grading system of Carswell et al. ibid. . As shown in Table 5, the injection of serum of mice treated with LTA obtained in the Preparation Example was given by intraperitoneal injection at varying doses of 125 40,000 µg mouse to groups of 4 female, 5 week old BALB c mice Charles River Japan Inc. with or without previous priming with None of the normal mice died by the injection of 40,000 µg of LTA, while 500 µg and 250 µg of a reference LPS killed all and half of each group of 4 test mice, respectively. With LTA 0.5 g was dissolved in distilled water together with 10 g of mannitol and the volume was adjusted to 200 ml. After a filtration of the solution through a filter membrane millipore filter , 0.22 µm , 2 ml aliquots of the filtrate were placed in vials under sterilized conditions, followed by lyophilization by a conventional method. The resulting vials, each containing 5 mg of LTA, can be used for injection after dissolving in 2 ml of distilled water or physiological saline for injection. LTA 15 g and mannitol 55 g were mixed homogeneously. 70 mg portions of the mixed powder were filled in No. 4 gelatin capsules of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. The resulting capsules, containing 15 mg of LTA in each capsule, passed Disintegration Test for Capsules in accordance with the Japanese Pharmacopoeia.
