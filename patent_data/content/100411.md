# Process for producing carbonizable oxidized fibers and carbon fibers.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for producing carbon fibers comprising providing cooling rollers in a 240 to 400 C oxidative atmosphere, heating a precursor composed of continuous filaments in said oxidative atmosohere while intermittently and repeatedly bringing the precursor into contact with tne cooling rollers to thereby convert the precursor to oxidized fibers, and carbonizing the resulting oxidized fibers in an inert atmosphere of at least 800 C.
