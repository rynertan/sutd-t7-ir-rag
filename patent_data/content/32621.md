# Improvement in selective cracking reactions by cofeeding organic amine or ammonia.

## Abstract
An improved process for selective cracking of 1,4 disubstituted aromatic compounds whereby the yield of recyclable olefin cracking product is increased. The pro cess is carried out in the presence of a specified type of crystalline zeolite cracking catalyst e.g. ZSM 5 and the reactor feed is admixed with ammonia or an organic amine.
