# METHOD OF INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY OF MICROPOROUS SEPARATORS

## Abstract
A foraminous protective cathode interposed between having a steel cathode and polymeric microporous separator in a diaphragm type electrolytic cell reduces or eliminates separator plugging thereby increasing the useful life expectancy of the separator. The protective cathode has an electroconductive metallic surface of at least one of nickel, cobalt, copper, chromium, noble metals and noble metal oxides.
