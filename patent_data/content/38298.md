## Description
ISOXAZOLYL INDOLAMINES This application relates to novel isoxazolyl indolamines, their acid addition and alkali metal salts, processes for their production and their use as pharmaceuticals in particular anti diabetic agents. In particular the invention relates to compounds of formula IEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, Cl C4alkyl or Cl C4alkoxyX R2 represents hydrogen or hydroxyl, R3 and R4 represent, independently, Cl C4alkyl or together with the adjacent nitrogen atomEMI1.2 orEMI1.3 wherein n is 1, 2 or 3, R5 represents hydrogen or Cl C4alkyl and R6 represents hydrogen, C1 C4alkyl, phenyl or phenyl mono substituted by fluorine, chlorine, Cl C4alkyl or C1 C4alkoxy. The present invention further provides a process for the production of compounds of formula I which comprises reducing the corresponding compound of formula IIEMI2.1 wherein R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above and Z signifies CO or CH The reduction according to the process is suitably carried out under an inert atmosphere of, for example, helium, argon or preferably nitrogen and in an inert solvent such as an ether e.g. diethylether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran. Examples of reducing catalysts which may be used when carrying out the process are those common for the reduction of carbonyl groups e.g. diborane and alkali metal hydride reducing agents e.g. sodium borohydride or, preferably, lithium aluminium hydride. It will be appreciated that when Z is CO, depending on the conditions employed, reduction will be either partial to give compounds of formula I wherein R2 represents hydroxyl or complete to give compounds of formula I wherein R2 represents hydrogen and conditions will thus be chosen according to the desired final product. In cases where a final product is desired in which R2 represents hydroxyl, temperatures may thus be critical and a preferred range is from about lO0C to 300C, most preferably from about 200C to 250C. If complete reduction to final products wherein R2 represents hydrogen is desired, a temperature range of from about 6O0C to 15O0C is preferred but is not critical. It will be appreciated that partial reduction can also be achieved by selection of a suitably weak reducing agent. Alternatively, compounds of formula I in which R2 is H may be produced using compounds of formula II in which Z is CH2 . The preferred temperatures in this case lie between 00 to 500C, most preferably between 200 and 300C. This embodiment represents the preferred method of producing compounds in which R6 is C1 4alkylO The compounds of formula II can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IIIEMI4.1 with a compound of formula IV,EMI4.2 wherein X represents a leaving group such as chlorine or bromine and R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of preferred solvents include water, an excess of a compound of the formula IV or an ether such as diethylether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene preferably the combination of water, diethvlether or tetrahydroduran and excess compound of formula IV.The preferred temperature is from about lO0to 500C, most preferably from about 200 to 30 C. The compounds of formula III in which Z is COcan be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V EMI5.1 with a compound of formula VI COX 2 VI wherein R1, R5, R6 and X are as defined above. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of preferred solvents include an ether such as diethylether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene,preferably diethylether. The preferred temperature is from about 100to 50 C, most preferably from about 200 to 300C. The compounds of formula V can be prepared by cyclising a compound of formula VIIEMI5.2 wherein R1, R5 and R6 are as defined above. The cyclisation is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid or, preferably, polyphosphoric acid, and in the presence of an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. benzene or toluene or preferably an excess of said acid. Preferred temperatures are of from about 700 to 150 C, most preferably 105 1200C. The compounds of formula VII can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIIIEMI6.1 with a compound of formula IXEMI6.2 wherein R1, R5 and R6 are as defined above. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid such as sulphuric acid, a polyphosphoric acid or preferably p toluene sulphonic acid and in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of preferred solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene or a lower alkanol such as methanol and most preferably ethanol. Preferred temperatures are of from about 00 1000C, most preferably 200 to 350C. The compounds of formula III in which Z is CH2 can be prepared by introducing the X group into a compound of formula Xa.EMI7.1 wherein R1, R5 and R6 are as defined above. When X is halogen, for example a suitable agent for its introduction is e.g. thionyl chloride or bromide or phosphorous oxychloride. The remaining reaction conditions are similar to those described for the reaction of compounds of formula V and formula VIS The compounds of formula Xa can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XI EMI8.1 wherein R1 and R3 to R6 are as defined above, with an alkali metal cyanide such as sodium or potassium cyanide. The reaction is effected in the presence of an aqueous alcoholic solvent. Suitable alcohols are e.g.lower alkanols such as methanol and preferably ethanol.Preferred reaction temperatures are from 800 to 1500C. This reaction leads to a mixture of the compound of formula Xa and the corresponding amide of formula XbEMI8.2 which can be converted to the compound of formula Xa by conventional hydrolysis techniques. The compounds of formula XI can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with a compound of formula IV both as defined above in the presence of formaldehyde, an acid catalyst such as acetic acid and an organic co solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are ethers such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran and particularly dioxane. Preferred temperatures are from about 100 to 300C, most preferably Oo to 100C. The products resulting from the above processes can be isolated and purified in conventional manner. Intermediate compounds can where appropriate be further reacted without isolation. The compounds of formulae II, III, V, VII, Xa, Xb and XI are new and also form part of the invention. Insofar as the production of other starting materials is not described above, these are either known or can be prepared in conventional manner from known starting materials. Depending on the conditions employed the compounds of formula I may be obtained either in free base form or in acid addition salt form. The acid addition salt forms of the compounds of formula I also form part of the invention. Free base forms of formula I may be converted into acid addition salt forms in conventional manner and vice versa. Examples of suitable salt forming acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic,hydroiodic, phosphorous, sulphuric, acetic, maleic, fumaric and the like. The compounds of formula I may also be isolated in the form of salts with bases, e.g.alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts.Such salt forms also form part of the invention. It will be understood that compounds of formula I wherein R2 OH may exist in racemic form or in the form of optically active isomers which can be produced or separated and isolated from the racemate in conventional manner. The invention extends to such isomeric forms as well as racemic forms. The compounds of the formula I possess pharmacological acticity. In particular, they possess hypoglycemic activity as indicated by the lowering of blood glucose in 6 to 8 week old male Royal Hart mice weighing 30 to 35 gram which are fasted in groups of 5 for 16 hours and thenare given an initial dose of 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight of the compound orally. Two hours after the test compound is administered the mice are anesthetized with 85 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight of sodium hexobarbital and five minutes later blood is collected via cardiac puncture. The blood samples are placed in an autoanalyser cup containing 0.025 millilitres of heparin 1.000 units per millilitres and the samples are capped, shaken and stored in ice.The glucose level is determined by the auto analyser potassium ferric cyanide N 2b method and these glucose levels are then compared with the glucose levels of the control group which receives orally 0.5 carboxymethyl cellulose and is run concurrently. To validate this experiment, a known hypoglycemic standard is included each time the test is run. The compounds are thus indicated for use as in the treatment of diabetes as hypoglycemic agents. The compounds of formula I also inhibit or impede post prandial hyperglycemia as indicated by a lowering of the blood sugar levels in male Wistar rats after an oral starch load. In this test male Wistar rats in groups of 5 which are fasted for 16 hours are given an initial dose of from 25 to 200 mg kg p.o. of the test compound.One hour later the rats are given 1.0 grams per kilogram of animal body weight of cooked starch load. Thirty minutes after administration of the starch, the rats are anesthetized with 120 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight of sodium hexobarbital after which blood is collected via cardiac puncture. The blood samples are placed in an autoanalyser cup containing 0.1 millilitres of heparin 1.000 units per millilitres .The heparinized blood is used to determine the blood sugar level with an autoanalyser. The blood sugar content is compared to the control group which receives 0.58 carboxymethyl cellulose and an oral starch load and are run concurrently. The compounds are thus also indicated for use in the treatment of diabetes by inhibiting or impeding postprandial hyperglycemia. An indicated suitable daily dosage in the treatment of diabetes as hypoglycemic agents is from about 50 to 2000 mg suitably administered in divided dose of 12.5 to 1000 mg, two to four times daily or in retard form. An indicated suitable daily dosage for inhibiting or impeding post prandial hyperglycemia in the treatment of diabetes is from about 25 to 1000 mg preferably administered at mealtimes e.g. three times a day in divided dosages of from about 10 to 400 mg The invention therefore also concerns a method of treating diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels or inhibiting or impeding post prandial z bypergi by administration of a compound of formula I, and also to compounds of formula I for use as pharmaceuticals e.g.as hypoglycemic agents or as agents for inhibiting or impeding post prandial hyperglycemia or for use in the treatment of the human or animal body by therapy. The compounds of formula I may be administered in free base form or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition or alkali metal salts1 which salt forms have the same order of activity as the free forms. The compounds of formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition or alkali metal salts may be administered alone, or in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, and, optionally other excipients, and administered orally in such forms as tablets, elixirs, capsules or suspensions or parenterally in such forms as injectable solutions or suspensions.
