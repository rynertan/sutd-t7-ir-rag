## Description
HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation in part of application serial number 939,632, filed September 5, 1978.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a new catalyst composition useful for initiating and promoting polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such a catalyst composition. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene in the presence of metallic catalysts, particularly the reaction products of organometallic compounds and transition metal compounds can be polymerized to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Typically such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures. Among the methods for producing suc linear olefin polymers, some of the most widely utilized are those described by Professor Karl Ziegler in U.S. Patents 3,113,115 and 3,257,332. In these methods, the catalyst employed is obtained by admixing a compound of a transition metal cf Groups 4B, 5B, 6B and 8 of Mendelecv s Periodic Table ofElements with an organometallic compound. Generally, the halides, oxyhalides and alkoxides or esters of titanium, vanadium and zirconium are the most widely used transition metal compounds.Common ezamDles of the organometallic compounds include the hydrides, alkyls and haloalkyls of aluminum, alkylalmninum halides, Crignard reagents, alkali metal aluminum hydrides, alkali metal borohydrides, alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides and the like. Usually, polymerization is carried out in a reaction medium comprising an inert organic liquid, e.g., an aliphatic hydrocarbon and the aforementioned catalyst. One or more olefins may be brought into c contact with the reaction medium in any suitable manner A molecular weight regulator, which is normally hydrogen, is usually present in the reaction vessel in order to suppress the formation of undesirably high molecular weight polymers. Following polymerization, it is common to remove catalyst residues from the polymer by repeatedly treating the polymer with alcohol or other deactivating agent such as aqueous base. Such catalyst deactivation and cr removal procedures are expensive both in time and material consumed as well as the equipment required to carry out such treatment. Furthermore, most of the aforementioned known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in slurry i.e., wherein the polymer is not dissolved in the carrier than in solution i.e., wherein the temperature is high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier . The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization is generally believed to be caused by the general tendency of such catalysts to become ranidly depleted or deactivated by significantly higher temperatures that are normally employed in solution processes. In addition, processes involving the copolymerization of ethylene x.ith higher alpha ol fins exhibit catalyst efficiencies significantly lower than ethylene homopolymerization processes. Recently, catalysts having higher efficiencies have been disclosed, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,392,159, U.S. Patent 3,737,393, West German Patent Application 2,231,982 and British Patents 1,305,610 and 1,358,437.While the increased efficiencies achieved by using these recent catalysts are significant, even higher efficiencies are desirable particularly in copolymerization processes. These high efficiency catalysts generally produce polymers of relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. In view of the foregoing problems encountered in the use of conventional Ziegler catalysts, it would be highly desirable to provide a polymerization catalyst that is sufficiently active, even at solution polymerization temperature above 1400C, to produce such high quantities of olefin ho1 o.po ymers or copolymers per unit of catalyst that it is no longer necessary to remove catalyst residue in order to obtain a polymer of the desired purity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in one aspect, is an improvement in the catalytic reaction product of A a tetravalent titanium compound or a complex of a trivalent titanium compound with an electron donor, B an organoaluminum compound, C an organo magnesium component and CD a halide source the improvement being the use of a tetravalent tin compound as the halide source.The magnesium component is 1 a complex. of an organomagnesium compound and an organometallic compound which solubilizes the organomagnesium compound in a hydrocarbon solve or 2 an organomagnesium compound The halide source is a tetravalent tin halide corresponding to the formula SnXaR, a wherein R is a monovalent organic radical usually hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, X is halogen, and a is a number from 1 to 4.The proportions of the foregoing components of said catalytic reaction products are such that the atomic ratios of the elements are Mg Ti is from about 1 1 to about 2000 1 preferably from about 5 1 to about 200 1 most preferably from about 5 1 to about 75 1 Al Ti is from about 0.1 1 to about 2000 1 preferably from about 0.51 to about 200 1 most preferably from about 1 1 to about 75 1 Sn Mg is from about 0.10 1 to about 2 1 preferably from about 0.25 1 to about 1.5 1 mDst preferably from about .5 1 to about 1 1 excess X A1 is from about 0.0005 1 to about 10 1 preferably from about 0.002 1 to about 2 1 most preferably from about 0.01 1 to about 1.4 1. The X is excess halide above that which would be theoretically required to convert the magnesium compound to the dihalide. In a second aspect, the invention is a process for polymerizing at least one a olefin order conditions characeristic of Ziegler polymerization wherein the aforementioned reaction product is employed as the catalyst. In view of the reduced activity of conventionalZiegler catalysts in the copolymerization of a olefins, particularly at solution polimerization temperatures, it is indeed surprising that the aforementioned catalytic reaction product is a high efficiency catalyst capable of producing more than a million pounds of olefin polymer or copolymer per pound of transition metal under such polymerization conditions. Accordingly, olefin polymers produced in accordance with the foregoing process generally contain lower amounts of catalyst residues than polymers produced in the presence of conventional catalyst even after subecting such conventionally produced polymers to catalyst removal treatments. Further, these catalytic reaction products provide higher efficiencies than corresponding catalysts employing other halide sources, particularly HCl. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process wherein an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalytic reaction product as hereinbefore described. Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins using the catalytic reaction product of this invention. The foregoing polymerization process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are generally the aliphatic c monoolefins or a diolefins having rrom 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustratively, such alpha olefins can include ethylene, propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, 3 methylbutene 1, 4 methylpentene 1 hexene 1, octene 1, dodecene 1, octadecene 1, 1,7 octadiene and the like It is understood that a olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, i.e. up to about 25 weight percent based on the copolymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, alpha methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventional Ziegler catalysts. ost benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic alpha monolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethyier. and u to 50, especially from about 0.1 to about 40 weight percent of propylene, butnene 1, hexene 1, octene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, 1,7octadiene or similar alpha olefin or diolefin based on total monomer. Suitable tetravalent tin compounds include those represented by the formula SnXaR4 a wherein R is a monovalent organic radical usually hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy as hereinafter defined, X is halogen, particularly chlorine or bromine and a is a number from 1 to 4. Particularly suitable tetravalent tin compounds are tin tetrachloride, butyltin trichloride, diethytin dichloride, diethyltin dibromide, phenyltin trichloride, mixtures thereof and the like. Advantageously, the teravalent titanium compound is represented by the empirical formula TiXn OR 4 n wherein X is a halogen, particularly chlorine or bromine, R is an alkyl or an aryl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and n has a value of O to 4. Such titanium compounds are preferably derived from the titanium halides wherein one or more of the halogen atoms are repiaced by an alkoxy or aryloxy croup. Exemplary of such compounds include tetrabutoxy titanium, tetra isopropoxy titanium, dibutoxy titanium dichloride, monoethoxy titanium trichloride, tetraphenoxytitanium and the like. Advantageously, the trivalent titanium complex is represented by the empirical formula TiZ3 L x wherein Z is halide, and L is an electron donating compound such as water or an organic electron donor, e.g., alcohol, ether, ketone, amine or olefin, and x is a number from 1 to 6.Usually, the organic electron donor has from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and donates an unshared pair of electrons to the complex. In preferred complexes, Z is chloride or bromide, most preferably chloride and L is alcohol, especially an aliphatic alcohol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as isopropyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol. Exile the exact structure of the complex is not known, it is believed to contain 3 valence bonds to the halide ions and 1 to 6, preferably 2 to 4,coordination bonds to the electron donating compound.The titanium halide complex is most advantageously prepared by heating the trivalent titanium halide dispersed in the electron donating compound under nitrogen or similar inert atmosphere. Usually the formation of the complex is visually indicated by a definite change in color. For example, when the dark purple alpha TiCl3 is heated in anhydrous isopropyl alcohol under nitrogen, complex formation is indicated by the formation of a brilliant blue solution. The complex is norinally solid however, liquid complexes would be suitable. In addition to a a TiCl3, the A, y and a crystalline forms of titanium trichloride are advantageously employed in the preparation of the complex. Also suitable are titanium tribromide, titanium trifluoride and the like. Of the foregoing, the A and a forms of titanium trichloride are preferred. Exemplary electron donating compounds suitably employed include aliphatic alcohols, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, butanol and others having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms ethers ketones acenyoes gamines olefins, and the like having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and water. The preferred organomagnesium component is a hydrocarbon soluble complex illustrated by the formula MgR 2, xMR y wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, M is aluminum, zinc or mixtures thereof and x is about 0.001 to 10, especially from about 0.15 to about 2.5 and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyi, alkenyl and and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having I to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred.Likewise, preferably, hydro carbyloxy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkoxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms are preferred. Hydrocarbyl is preferred over hydrocarbylor. This complex is prepared by reacting particulate magnesium such as magnesium turnings, or magnesium particles with about a stoichiometric amount of hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloAy halide, illustrated as R X. The resulting hydrocarbon insoluble MgR 2 is solubillzed by adding the organo metallic compound such as A1R 3 or mixtures thereof with ZnR 12. The amount of organometallic compounds which is added to the MgR 2 to form the organomagnesium complex should be enough to solubilize a siglificant amount of MgR 2, e.g., at least S weight percent of NgR2 is solubilized. It is preferred to solubilize at least 50 weight percent of the MgR 2 and especially preferred to solubilize all the MgR 2. When employing a mixture of AIR 3 and ZnR 2 to solubilize MgR 2, the atomic ratio of Zn to Al is from about 3000 1 to about 0.1 1, preferably from about 350 1 to about 1 1.In order to obtain maximum catalyst efficiency at polymerization temperatures above 180 F, it is desirable to minimize the amount of aluminum in the complex as well as in the total catalyst. Accordingly, for catalysts having Al Ti atomic ratios less than 120 1, it is desirable to have a Mg Al atomic ratio more than 0.3 1, preferably from about 0.5 1 to 10 1.In suitable complexes, organometallic compounds other than AlR1r3, ZnR 2 or mixtures thereof which also solubilize the organomagnesium compound in hydrocarbon are employed in beneficial amounts, usually an amount sufficient to produce an atomic ratio of 0.01 1 to 10 1 of metal of the organometallic compounds to magnesium. Examples of such other organometallic compounds include boron trialkyls such as boron triethyl, alkyl silanes such as dimethyl silane and tetraethyl silane, alkyl tin and alkyl phosphorous compounds. Alternative to the aforementioned solubilized magnesium complexes, it is also advantageous to employ organomagnesium compounds as the organomagnesium component. Such compounds, although often insoluble ir. hydrocarbons, are suitably employed. These compounds can be rendered soluble in hydrocarbon by addition of e her, gamine, etc., althrough such solubilizing agents often reduce the activity of the catalyst. Recently, such compounds have been made hydrocarbon soluble without using such catalyst poisons, e.g., as taught in U.S. 3,646,231.The more recent hydrocarbon soluble organomagnesium compounds are the most desirable if an organomagnesium compound is to be us as the organomagnesium component. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary suitable magriesium dialkyls include particularly n butyl sec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyl n butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n oc tyl magnesium and others wherein alkyl has from 1 to 2C carbon atoms.Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenyl magnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and ditolylmagnesium, being especially preferred. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. Suitable organoaluminum compounds include those represented by the formula A1R3 aXa wherein R is hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy or as herein before defined such as alkyl, X is a halogen and a is a number from zero to 3. st t preferred are the aluTinunn alkyl such as for example triethyl aluminium, triisobutvl aluminum, diethylaluminium chloride, diethylaluminium bromide, mixtures thereof and the like. It is understood that the organic moieties of the aforementioned organomagnesium, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficiently active to react with the Zerewitinoff reagent. In order to maximize catalyst efficienct, the catalyst can be prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst i an inert liquid diluent in any order of addi tion so long as the tin halide and titanium compound are not present together in the absence of the aluminum compound. An especially preferred order of edition is organomagnesium compound, halide source, organoaluminium compound and titanium compound or complex. The foregoing catalyst components are combined inproportions sufficient to provide atomic ratios as previously mentionec. The foregoing catalytic reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent. The concentrations of catalyst components are preferably such that when the essential components of the catalytic reaction product are corsined, the resultant slurry is from about 0.005 to about 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium.By way or an example of suitable ilert organic diluents can be mentioned liquefied ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from about 50 to about 200 C. Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, decalin and the like. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out order an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatures in the range from about 1C0 to about 2000C, preferably from about 0 to about 1000C.The period of mixing is not considered to be critical as it is found that a sufficient catalyst composition most often occurs within about 1 minute or less. In the preDaration of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. If desired, the catalytic reaction product of this invention may also contain a dialkyl zinc component wherein the alkyl groups are the same or different and contain from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. Suitable such dialkyl zinc compounds include, for example, diethyl zinc, diisopropyl zinc, di npropyl zinc, di n butyl zinc, di sec butyl zinc mixtures thereof aild the like. Such zinc compounds tend to provide polymers of broadened molecular weight distribu.ion. In the polymerization process employing the aforementioned catalytic reaction product, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the above catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures in the range from about 0 to about 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from about 1300 to about 250 C for a residence tiiro. of about a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. It is generally desirable to carry but the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen and a catalytic amount of the catalytic reaction product is generally within the range from about 0.0001 to about 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent.It is understood, however, that the most advantageous catalyst ccncentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons and that the foregoing range is given to obtain maximum catalyst yields in weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally in the polymerization process, a carrier which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer, is generally employed. In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer.If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes ceDleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized, For best resuits, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. It is understood that inert diluents employed in the polyrerization recipe are suitably as defined hereinbefore. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively lo, e.g., from about 50 to about 1000 psig, especially front about 100 to about 600 psig. However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment.During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range from about 1 to about 10 weight prcent, most aavantageously about 1.2 to about 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess on ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed in the practice of this invention to lower the molecular weight of the resultant polymer For the purpose of this in vention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from about 0.001 to about 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of rocn within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers. It is understood that hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to u he vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitablestirring or other means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization can be allowed to remain unstirred while the polymerization takes place. In the case of more raid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for reflexing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present and thus removing the heat of reaction. In any event adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization.If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous ranner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction be which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to raintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the plymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent if any is erloyed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the cata 1yst residue removal steps. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reager.t of the types conventionally employed for deactivatingZiegler catalysts.The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and to possess a relatively broad molecular eight distribution. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention, and should not be construed as limiting its scope. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
