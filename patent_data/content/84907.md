# Apparatus for the liquid processing of a surface of a material in the form of a sheet, a web or a plate.

## Abstract
An apparatus is described for the liquid processing of a surface of a moving sheet, web or plate 11 . Processing liquid 24 is supplied to said surface via a plurality of elongate discharge orifices 13a 18a extending across the width of said moving sheet or web 11 in a non perpendicular direction with respect to the sense in which said sheet, web or plate 11 is advanced within said apparatus. By the said non perpendicular arrangement of the discharge orifices 13a 18a air bubbles entrapped in the processing liquid 24 as a result of pumping can be carried off so that no processing faults occur.
