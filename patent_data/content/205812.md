# Torque transducer coupling.

## Abstract
A torque transducer coupling which has a torsion beam coupling an input to an output member, the torsion beam further having an end portion which cooperates with adja cent end portions of the input and output members to effect direct mechanical coupling therebetween when the relative angular movement of the input and output member reaches a predetermined limit thereby preventing excess strain of the torsion beam while allowing use of a torsion beam having sensitive response to torque loads.
