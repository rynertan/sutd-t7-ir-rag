# Aircraft pylon multi contact electrical connector.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to an electrical connector with multi pin socket contacts suitable for use in locations where the receptacle assembly 20 is attached to a support, such as the underside of an aircraft wing, and plug assembly is mounted on a separate detachable structure, such as a pylon. The plug assembly 60 engages the receptacle through collet fingertips 82 . A separate, but not independent, capsule assembly 134 is mated with the receptacle socket contacts by vertical movement imparted by a cam assembly 200 . The mated engaged connector is locked in that relation by balls 92 juxtaposed between a capsule assembly channel 192 and a plug housing sleeve 100 . The plug housing is suitably floated on spring loaded mounts 222 attached to the pylon skin. The connector is unmated, unlocked and disengaged. Movement of the pylon skin depresses trip ears 116 on the plug housing the ears depress the outer locking sleeve 100 to release the ball lock and to permit spring action to unmate the receptacle plug contacts spring action then further depresses the outer locking shell so that the fingertips 82 release the receptacle and the plug assembly is free and ready for another engagement mating. A retractable button 272 signals a no mate relation except when the connector is fully mated and locked.
