# Process for preparing trithiocarbonic acid diesters.

## Abstract
A new process is described for the preparation of trithiocarbonic acid esters of formula RS SR₁ in which R and R₁, which can be the same or different, are aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic radicals. The new process is characterised in that an organic hydrosulphide and a base, or an inorganic sulphide, are reacted with carbon disulphide and an organic halide in stoichiometric propor tions in the absence of organic solvents, in the presence of an aqueous phase and a phase transfer catalyst.
