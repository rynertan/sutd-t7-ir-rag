# Conveying device for sheets.

## Abstract
Device for the conveying of sheets from each of a plurality of sheet piles via a partially common conveyor track. This track extends in vertical direction along superposed stock holders. Adjacent to the sheet delivery side a driven roller is stationarily arranged above each pile. Each of these rollers can function both as suction roller for separating sheets from a pile and as friction roller for conveying sheets in the common track. For separating sheets from a pile, each pile can be brought by pneumatic means into short contact with a driven roller then functioning as a suction roller. For conveying sheets in the common track, each roller co operates with a pressure roller. After a sheet in the common track has been gripped between a driven roller and a pressure roller, the sucting action of that driven roller is interrupted.
