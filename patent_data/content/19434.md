# A screening apparatus.

## Abstract
A conveyor 14 is pivotally mounted on a wheeled chassis 2 for movement between an extended operational position and a folded transporting position. The conveyor 14 includes an endless belt 16 and a boom frame 20 supporting the belt 16 . The boom frame 20 consists of a rear section 24 pivotally mounted on the chassis 2 , and a forward section 26 pivotally mounted to the rear section 24 . A screen device 54 is pivotally coupled to the conveyor forward section 26 , and a hopper 12 is mounted at the rear of the chassis 2 . To erect the apparatus, the conveyor section 26 is swung down to straighten the conveyor 14 , and hydraulic rams 30 are operated to raise the conveyor 14 sufficiently to move the screen device 54 by means of a hydraulic ram 66 . The rams 30 then raise the conveyor 14 to a desired operational position, and locating pins are inserted through aligned box members in box member assemblies 34 to retain the conveyor 14 in its operational position. The ram 66 is then operated to swing the screen device 54 into its operational position. After use, the screening apparatus is returned to its transporting position by carrying out the aforementioned operations in reverse order.
