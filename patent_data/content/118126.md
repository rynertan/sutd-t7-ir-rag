# Magnetic attraction system grinding method.

## Abstract
A magnetic attraction system grinding method and its apparatus are disclosed which are characterized by arranging a magnetic circuit forming means between an abrasive tool and a workpiece, thereby generating a grinding pressure required to grind said workpiece s surface, performing the operation of said abrasive tool through a rectilinearly reciprocating movement or rotary movement working along said workpiece surface during the existence of said grinding pressure while controlling either the grinding speed or the grinding stroke, and making said magnetic circuit with an electromagnet or permanent magnet assembly said abrasive tool with a magnetic material bonded grindstone.
