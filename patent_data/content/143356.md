# Optical system drive for optical recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for electromagnetically driving an objective in conformance with movements of an optical disc in the verti cal direction and deviations from track possibly produced in rotation of the disc, to thereby accomplish an automatic fo cussing of a write and or read light beam on the disc. A driven unit 24 including the oblective lens system 4 is supported by closely wound coil springs e.g. 55a 55d for suppressing unwanted resonance which will otherwise be produced in the driving operation. The apparatus is effective for controlling the focussed position of the light beam both in recording and re producing modes. The spring coils are integrally mounted on a stationary mounting member by molding.
