# Method of manufacturing shrinkable sleeves from cross linking plastics material.

## Abstract
A method to manufacture heat shrinkable plastics sleeves having uniform shrinking properties across the sleeve is achieved. The sleeves are manufactured from a cross linking plastics material by extruding a tube of the material at a temperature below the cross linking temperature of the plastics material. The tube is cut into individual sleeve pieces the lenght of which corresponds to the length of the finished sleeve. The sleeve pieces are heated to the cross linking temperature while keeping the pieces uniformly supported so that no deformation in the wall of the sleeves can take place. After the heating step the sleeves are removed from the supporting elements and are expanded while cooling to the desired diameter by placing the tube as a loop around two or more rotation parallel rolls which are moved away from each other.

## Description
Method of manufacturing shrinkable sleeves from crosslinking plastics materialThis invention relates to a method of manufacturing shrinkable sleeves from a cross linking plastics material.The manufacture of heat shrinkable sleeves from a crosslinking plastics material is known per se. Such sleeves are used i.a. for the sealing of joints on coated cables, tube joints and the like. The sleeve is manufactured, for example, by extruding of aplastics material that can be cross linked. The sleeve then has to be extruded at a temperature below the cross linking temperature. The finished sleeve has substantially its extruded dimensions. On the final site of use, the sleeve is placed over the joint to be sealed and heated with a burner or a hot air blower to the cross linking temperature of the plastics material, whereby the sleeve shrinks due to the cross linking reaction of the plastics material. The cross linking reaction can also be effected with high energy irradiation.As a raw material for said sleeves for example polymer plastics that can be cross linked with the help of peroxides, such as polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, chlorosulphonated polyethylene, ethylenepropylene copolymer, plasticized polyvinyl chloride can be used. The known shrinkable sleeves are suitable for most applications, even though they have their restrictions. Firstly, the degree of shrinkage due to the cross linking reaction is not sufficient, for example for such applications where the joint to be sealed is formed by two cables or tubes of different diameters, or possibly of two parallel wires or tubes. Furthermore, many of the cross linking plastics materials, which can come into question, have a high crosslinking temperature, being of the order of 140 to 1800C which also restricts the possibilities of heating the joints.Also many plastics melt partly or at least soften considerably at their cross linking temperatures thus exhibiting a very poor capacity for retaining their shape and giving an uneven sealing effect. The heating can also damage the pipes or the cables to be sealed. Additionally, energy irradiation is not a very effective cross linking method for tubes having a larger wall thickness as the energy irradiation can penetrate the sleeve wall to a depth of only about 0.5 tq 0.6 mm. These sleeves also shrink in their longitudinal direction, which can lead to an insufficient sealing effect in the joint.In order to eliminate the problems associated with the high cross linking temperature and the longitudinal shrinking, it has according to the US patent specification 3 086 242 been suggested a method for the manufacture of heatshrinkable tubular articles, according to which method a tubular material extruded from a cross linking plastics material is heated to a temperature above its cross linking temperature, whereby the cross linking of the plastics material takes place. Thereafter the tubular material is cooled and simultaneously expanded in its radial direction, whereby the material, when oooled to ambient temperature is retained in its expanded state. The expanded state can then be unlocked by reheating the tube, the tube thereby returning substantially to its extruded shape.During the said reheating stage the tube does not have to be heated to as high a temperature as during the cross linking reaction, the disadvantages connected with the heating thus being substantially eliminated. It is also possible to expand the tube to a diameter being 4 to 8 times the extruded diameter whereby a correspondingly higher degree of shrinkage is obtained as compared to that obtained during only crosslinking. The above methods, however, have their drawbacks. On the one hand it is difficult to contral that the tube retains its shape at the cross linking temperature, at which the tube changes into substantially plasticized state, and on the other hand the cross linked tube is expanded in the process by blowing air into the tube at a suitable pressure whereby the tube is expanded to a degree corresponding to the pressure. There is then however the risk that the expansion takes place unevenly and in an uncontrolled manner at different areas in the tube sidewall, which causes irregularities in the sidewall thickness of the final expanded product. A natural consequence of this is that the tube, during heating, shrinks unevenly whereby the joint will not be sealed tightly enough.These problems relating to the shape stability and uneven expansion are eliminated according to the invention so that the sleeve piece, which has been extruded at a temperature below its cross linking temperature, is cut into lengths corresponding substantially to the length of the finished sleeve or a multiple thereof, that the cut sleeve piece is heated to the cross linking temperature of the plastics material while being in a fixed position both on its exterior and interior side, and that the substantially cross linked sleeve piece is expanded during simultaneous cooling to the desired sleeve diameter araound two or more rotating, parallel rolls, which can be moved away from each other.In the method according to the invention the cut sleeve pieces from the extruder are fixed during the heating in the space between two coaxial tubes, which tube assembly is lowered into a heated medium, for example on oil bath, the temperature of which is somewhat over the cross linking temperature. Thereby the sleeve does not loose its shape and its wall thickness does not change at any point when the material is plasticized during the heating. When the plastics material has been cross linked, the sleeve pieces may be moved from the retaining means as the cross linking has changed the physical properties of the plastics material in such a way that the sleeve can be moved also at the temperature of the bath without any flowing taking place in its walls which could give rise to changes in thickness.Another possibility to retain the shape of the cut sleeve piece during the cross linking heating stage in the oil bath is to place the sleeve piece into a hollow cylinder having an inner diameter equivalent to the outer diameter of the sleeve piece and to close the cylinder ends, whereby the sleeve piece can be held by a slight internal overpressure against the inner surface of the cylinder wall.The internal pressure can advantageously be achieved by means of the heating oil injected into the retaining cylinders.The subsequent step in the method according to the invention is cooling and simultaneous expansion, which should be performed so that the expansion takes place evenly at all points in the sidewall of the sleeve. This expansion stage is carried out according to the invention by the tfiieading of the sleeve piece removed from the retaining means in the bath onto two or more parallel rolls so that the rolls will be contained within the loop formed by the sleeve. All these rolls must be operated at the same peripheral speed. The rolls must also be movable away from each other in order to expand the sleeve loop. In order to ensure that the expansion takes place uniformly it is advantageous to provide the roll surface with rills or grooves or to make it coarse in some other way. The rolls are preferably cooled in order to speed up the process. The sleeve piece rotates during this expansion stage more or less like a stretched ribbon around the rotating rolls and is expanded when the rolls are moved away from each other and cooled to a temperature at which the expanded state is stable. This rotating movement around the rolls guarantees that the sleeve wall is not expanded unevenly, whereby a homogenous sleeve is obtained. The sleeve is expanded at this stage in a radial direction to obtain the desired diameter.When the finished sleeve has been placed over a joint or the like to be sealed, the sleeve is heated to such an elevated temperature at which the expanded state of the plastic is unlocked and the sleeve returns substantially to the state prevailing before the expansion. The method according to the invention is described in more detail in the following Example.ExampleFrom polyethylene to which has been added about 2.05 by weight of dicumyl peroxide as a cross linking agent for the polyethylene, is extruded in an extruder provided with a cooler a tube having a diameter of 100 mm, and a wall thickness of about 2.2 nim. The tube is cut into sleeve pieces having a length of about 700 mm which are placed in the space between two coaxial tubes, the space substantially corresponding to the thickness of the sleeve wall. The tubes anS the interposed sleeve pieces are lowered for about 6 minutes into an oil bath, the temperature of which is about 1800C. After said time period the sleeve pieces are removed from the space between the two retaining tubes and placed on two expansion rolls.The rolls are provided with built in water cooling and their temperature is about 50 to 600C. The rolls are driven and can be moved away from each other. By means of the rotating rolls the sleeve is expanded in a radial direction about 60 z during a time period of about 1 1 2 minutes during which time the temperature of the sleeve has fallen to about 800 C. The sleeve piece is cut into final sleeve length, is removed, and further cooled and cleaned from attached oil, and the sleeve is ready for use. When the sleeve is heated to a temperature of about 1300C it shrinks tow adiameter of about 100.5 mm. No shrinkage in the longitudinal direction takes place. As is known, the degree of cross linking is dependant on the temperature and may vary even for the same plastics material within a fairly wide range. If the reaction temperature is lowered, naturally the reaction time has to be prolonged correspondingly.
