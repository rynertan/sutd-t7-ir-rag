HAIR TONIC COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a novel hair tonic composition suitable for use in preventing the generation of dandruff or scurf in hair and itching in the scalp and in accelerating the growth of hair.More specifically, it relates to a novel hair tonic composition containing, as an effective ingredient, products obtained from the interaction of at least one vegetable or animal fat or oil with at least one fungus having a lipase producing capability, selected from fungi belonging to genera Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium,Geotrichum, and Sclerotium. The possession of a healthy and profuse head of hair throughout life is the ambition of most human beings. various kinds of hair dressings, including hair tonic compositions, have been used for alleviating or curing epilation or depilation i.e., the involuntary loss of hair and subsequent balding . However, although various kinds of disease appear, such as alopecia, the causes thereof and the mechanisms thereof are not fully understood. Accordingly, at present there are no truly effective agents for alleviating the epilation, accelerating the growth of hair, and further alleviating or curing the generation of dandruff in the hair and itching in the scalp. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel hair tonic composition capable of effectively alleviating the generation of dandruff and itching in the hair and scalp and also of exhibiting a remarkable and real acceleration of the growth of hair. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the description set forth hereinbelow. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a hair tonic composition containing, as an effective ingredient, a product obtained from the interaction of at least one member selected from the group consisting of vegetable and animal fats and oils with at least one fungus, having a lipase producing capability, selected from fungi belonging to generaAspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium, Geotrichum, andSclerotium. The inventors have previously found that, after making a detailed comparative study of the microflora of the scalps of persons with healthy hair and those of persons with unhealthy hair e.g., the generation of dandruff and itching in the scalp and abnormal depilation , Staphylococcus capitis constitutes all or most parts of the microflora in the scalp of those with healthy hair, and that, when the cells of Staphylococcus caDitis or the treated products thereof are applied te the scalp, a remarkable growth effect of hair can be obtained Furthermore, the inventors have clarified that the cells of Staphylococcus capitis have the lipase activity and testosterone 5 reductase i.e., 5a reductase inhibitory activity.The term 5c reductase denotes an enzyme which reduces testosterone to Sa dihydrotestosterone. Based on these findings, the inventors have suggested that the above mentioned activities are closely correlated with the growth effect of hair see U.S. Patent Application No. 505,273 orEuropean Patent Application No. 83303654.4 . The inventors have also found that, when the correlation of the above mentioned lipase activity and Sa reductase inhibitory activity with the hair growth effect is studied in detail, products containing fatty acids, as a main contituent, obtained from the interaction of lipase from Staphylococcus capitis with fats and oils, have a strong Sa reductase inhibitory activity, and, furthermore, the above mentioned fatty acids per se have an effective action on the growth of hair. The inventors have further found that, after making a detailed inspection to find other microorganisms having properties similar to those of the above mentionedStaphylococcus capitis, the products obtained from the interaction of vegetable and animal fats and oils with fungi belonging to genera Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Pencillium, Geotrichum, and Sclerotium have an effective action on the growth of hair and also alleviate dandruff and itching. The microorganisms or fungi used in the present invention are those having a lipase activity and belonging to genera Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium,Geotrichum, and Sclerotium, and those capable of producing products having an effect on the hair growth when the fungi are interacted with fats and oils. These fungi can be any species and strains including those isolated from the natural occurring microorganisms and stored in any depository, those newly isolated, or artificial or natural mutants thereof, as long as they have the above mentioned properties. Typical examples of these microorganisms are Aspergillus niger NRRL 337 deposited in the Agricultural Research Culture CollectionNRRL, and Rhizopus delemar ATCC 34612, Penicillium cyclopium ATCC 34613, Geotrichum candidum ATCC 34614, and Sclerotinia libertiana ATCC 22025 deposited in theAmerican Type Culture Collection ATCC .These microorganisms are freely available from NRRL and ATCC. If the microorganisms used in the present invention are desired to be freshly isolated, any conventional manner known in the art can be used. Furthermore, if the mutants thereof are desired to be obtained, any conventional mutation technique can be used in the present invention. The fats and oils used in the present invention are those which can producer upon interaction with the above mentioned fungi, products having an effect on the hair growth. Examples of these fats and oils are vegetable oils such as olive oil, castor oil, cotton seed oil, coconut oil, soybean oil, palm oil, safflower oil, colza oil, rice bran oil, tsubaki oil camellia oil , and sesame oil, and animal fats and oils such as tallow, lard, mutton tallow, mink oil, and whale oil.These fats and oils can be used alone or in any mixture thereof. The methods for interacting the fats and oils with the above mentioned fungi are not specifically limited.However, the following methods can be conveniently used from the practical point of view. 1 The above mentioned fungi are cultured in a culture medium containing the fats and oils 2 The above mentioned fungi are cultured in a culture medium and the cultured cells of the fungi are then brought into contact with the fats and oils in an aqueous medium or 3 The above mentioned methods 1 and 2 are combined. When the above mentioned method 1 is used, any culture conditions under which the fungi grows well can be used without limitation. Any nitrogen source which can be utilized by the fungi is used as a nitrogen source in the culture medium. Preferable examples of the nitrogen sources are organic nitrogen sources, for example, protein decomposition products such as casein peptones, soybean peptones, tripticase peptones, and casamino acids, and amino acids extracts such as meat extracts and yeast extracts soybean cake and inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonium salts and nitrates.These nitrogen sources can be used alone or in any mixture thereof. Any carbon source which can be utilized by the fungi is used as a carbon source in the culture medium. Typical examples of such carbon sources are dextrin, galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, luctose, and glycerine. Furthermore, inorganic salts such as phosphates, hydrochlorides, magnesium salts, potassium salts, and sodium salts vitamines amino acids or growth factors containing a large amount of these substances may be optionally used in the culture medium, depending upon the selection of the nitrogen sources. In general, the above mentioned nitrogen sources and carbon sources are independently used in Åa concentration of 0.1 g liter to 100 g liter, respectively, in the culture medium, depending upon the types of nitrogen and carbon sources. Furthermore, the above mentioned inorganic salts and growth factors are generally used in a concentration of 0.01 g liter to 50 liter, respectively, in the culture medium, depending upon the types of inorganic salts and the growth factors. The cultivation temperature is generally 200C to 340C, preferably 250C to 280C. The cultivation is generally effected at a pH of 3.5 to 8.5, preferably under aerobic conditions by, for example, a shaking culture or an aeration agitating culture. The cultivation time is generally 20 to 45 hours.The desired cultivation can be directly carried out. However it is desirable that the precultured products obtained from a small scale preculture are inoculated into a culture medium. The cultivation is effected by adding the above mentioned fats and oils to the culture medium. The above mentioned fats and oils can be contained in the culture medium prior to the cultivation or can be added to the culture medium during the cultivation after a certain amount of the cells is proliferated. The amount of the fats and oils is generally 1 g liter to 250 liter, preferably 5 g liter to 50 g liter. When the above mentioned method 2 is used, the above mentioned fungus is cultivated in the same manner as mentioned in method 1 , except that no fats and oils are added to the culture medium. After the cultivation is completed, the cultured cells are brought into contact with the above mentioned fats and oils. The contact of the cultured cells with the fats and oils can be most simply carried out, while appropriately stirring, after adding the fats and oils to the cultured medium containing the cultured cells of the fungus. However, if it is necessary to remove the medium components from the cultured fungus, the cells of the fungus are isolated from the cultured mixture by any conventional method, and the isolated cells are then suspended in an appropriate aqueous medium, for example, in a phosphate buffer solution, followed by the addition of the fats and oils.The pH and temperature conditions during the contact of the cells with the fats and oils are those within the ranges of the above mentioned culture of the fungus. The hair tonic composition according to the present invention contains, as an effective ingredient, the interaction products of the fungi with the fats and oils mentioned above. The interaction products can be incorporated into the hair tonic composition in various embodiments. Typical examples of such embodiments are as follows a The culture products obtained from the above mentioned method 1 , or the reaction mixtures obtained from the above mentioned method 2 or 3 b The liquid mixtures obtained by removing the cultured cells from the culture products of the above mentioned method 1 or the reaction mixtures of the above mentioned method 2 or 3 c The mixtures containing fatty acids or the fatty acid mixtures separated from and optionally purified to any extent the culture produdts of the above mentioned method 1 , the reaction mixtures of the above mentioned method 2 or 3 , or the above mentioned liquid mixtures b . In the practice of the above mentioned embodiment b , any separation or isolation technique conventionally used for separating or isolating cells from culture products or reaction products containing the cells can be used. Furthermore, in the practice of the above mentioned embodiment c , any conventional technique generally used in the separation and recovery of fatty acids contained in liquid media can be used.For example,. the culture mixtures or reaction mixtures obtained from the interaction of the fungi with the fats and oils are directly used for recovering fatty acids therefrom. However, when the culture mixtures, which are obtained from the culture media containing as a main raw material soybean cake or other materials which remain as a solid substance after the cultivation, are used, the remaining solid contents are desirably removed from the cultured mixture together with a total or partial amount of the cultured cells.. The recovery of the fatty acids from the above mentioned cultured mixtures, reaction mixtures, or solid content removal mixtures obtained above can be advantageously effected by an extraction method from the commercial point of view.Any extraction solvent which can dissolve the desired fatty acids but is not substantially missible with water can be used. Examples of such extraction solvents are ethyl acetate, ether, benzene, chloroform, and hexane.These solvents can be used alone or in any mixture thereof during the extraction. The extracts are then evaporized to remove the extraction solvents therefrom The resultant residues can be used as an active ingredient in the hair tonic composition according to the present invention. However, when further purification of the active ingredients is desired, any conventional methods for purifying organic compounds having an acid group can be used. For example, the above mentioned organic extracts are mixed with aqueous basic media such as basic buffers to form the salts of the desired active ingredients, whereby the active ingredients in the form of the salts are transferred into the aqueous phase in the dissolved form and, if desired, these active ingredients in the liquid media can be again extracted with the organic extraction solvent under an acidic condition.Alternatively, the crude products containing active ingredients are adsorbed by adsorbents such as silica gel and the adsorbed products can be separately eluted by solvents such as chloroform and benzene, alone or in any mixture. As mentioned above, it is considered that there is a close correlation between the hair growth and the lipase activity and Sa reductase inhibitory activity of the hair tonic composition applied to the surface of the scalp. The interaction products i.e., the active ingredients obtained from the interaction of the fungi with the vegetable and animal fats and oils have the 5a reductase inhibitory activity, or both the Sa reductase inhibitory activity and lipase activity. That is, active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiments a and b have both the Sa reductase inhibitory activity and lipase activity, whereas the active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiment c do not have the lipase activity but have a strong 5u reductase inhibitory activity due to the presence of concentrated fatty acids. These active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiments a , b and c can be most suitably used depending upon their characteristics in view of the properties of the base materials of the hair tonic compositions. The amounts of the products i.e., the active ingredients obtained from the interaction of the fungi with the fats and oils largely depend upon the types of the active ingredients of the embodiments a , b and c , the types of the base materials of the hair tonic compositions, and the final forms of the hair tonic compositions. For example, the hair tonic composition of the present invention preferably includes 0.1 to 20 by weight of the active ingredients based on the weight of the hair tonic composition in the case of the above mentioned embodiment a or b . In the case of the active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiment c , the active ingredients are preferably included in an amount of 0.01 to 10 by weight based on the weight of the hair tonic composition and depending upon the purification degree of the fatty acids. The hair tonic compositions of the present invention comprise the active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiments a , b , or c contained in any conventional base materials of the hair tonic compositions.Examples of such base materials are as follows I Water or aqueous solutions II Aqueous alcoholic solutions mainly containing alcohols III Propylene glycol, liquid paraffin, and ceresin and IV Japan wax, hardened oils, lanolin derivatives, beeswax, and vaseline. When the active ingredients of the above mentioned embodiments a or b are incorporated into the hair tonic compositions to effectively utilize the lipase activity thereof, the above mentioned base materials I are preferably used. On the other hand, when the Sa reductase inhibitory activity is desired to be utilized, any base materials of cosmetic compositions can be used without limitation. For example, the above mentioned base materials I to IV can be used alone or in any combination e.g., solutions, emulsions . In addition to the above mentioned active ingredients, various conventional ingredients suitably used in the formulation of a hair tonic composition or a hair dressing composition can be incorporated in a conventional amount into the hair tonic composition of the present invention. Typical examples of such ingredients are cantharis tincture, Jaborandi tincture,Japanese green gentian Swertia Japonica extract, female hormones, vitamin E, nicotinic acid derivatives, other vitamins such as vitamin B groups, amino acids such as serine and methionine, acetyl choline derivatives, cepharanthine, photosensitizing dyes, menthol, salicylic acid, resorcinol, beeswax, cetanol, triethanol amine, borax, lower alcohol esters of C14 to C18 saturated fatty acids, cetanol amine, glycerol monostearate, glycerol, isopropyl myristate, castor oil, citric acid, plant gums, and perfumes.These ingredients can be optionally incorporated into the hair tonic composition of the present invention unless the desired effect of the present invention is impaired. The final forms of the hair tonic composition according to the present invention can be any conventional form of hair tonic or hair dressing compositions, such as hair lotion, hair cream, hair liquid, hair oil, pomade, and hair stick. Other forms can also be utilized. The hair growth effect of the active ingredients used in the present invention is not clearly understood, but an attempted explanation is given hereinbelow without prejudice to the present invention. Various theories have been proposed relating to the causes of depilation, epilation, dandruff, and itching.For example, an unbalanced hormone constitution theory, a nutrient relating theory, a seborrhea theory, and a genetic or hereditary theory are know and it appears that there is a high correlation between the above mentioned abnormal conditions and the development of sebaceous gland see Masumi Inaba, Mainichi Life November, 1981, pages 26 to 35 Saishin Keshohin Kagaku Recent Cosmetics Science , page 130 published by Yakuji Nippo Sha in 1980 Kenji Adachi et. al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, 41 4 , pages 884 to 890 1970 Susumu Takayasu et. al., Journal of Investigative Dermatology 74, pages 187 to 191, 1980 . That is, when the sebaceous gland of the scalp is developed by nutrients, hormones or the like, the amount of Sa reductase in the sebaceous gland increases. The level of Sa dihydrotestosteron, more active androgen, becomes high. This tissue active androgen is tranferred to hair papilla via blood vessels, thereby alleviating the activities of adenylcyclase in hair matrix cells. As a result, it is believed that the size of hair follicles is gradually reduced and, therefore, the hair becomes thin and downy, years of repetition of these processes cause baldness. On the other hand, dandruff is formed because sebam is secreted and exudated to the surface of scalp in a large amount, due to the hypertrophy of sebaceous gland, and is mixed with horney or keratin peeled from the surface of the scalp. The dandruff thus formed inhibits dermal or skin respiration and the intake of nutrients into the hair root portions. This also causes baldness. Based on these mechanisms for generating depilation, epilation, and dandruff, the lipase activity and the Sa reductase inhibitory activity are important and essential characteristics and properties which the hair tonic compositions should have. These activities also become a standard or criterion for scientifically evaluating the effect of the hair tonic or hair dressing compositions. As mentioned above, the above mentioned fungi used in the present invention have a lipase producing activity and a Sa reductase inhibitory activity, and produce fatty acids having a strong 5 reductase inhibitory activity when the lipase is allowed to interact with lipids or fats and oils. Accordingly, when the culture product or the reaction products of the above mentioned embodiment a or the cell removed liquid thereof of the above mentioned embodiment b are used as an active ingredient of the hair tonic composition according to the present invention, the hair tonic composition has a lipase activity and a strong Sa reuctase inhibitory activity.On the other hand, when the fatty acids recovered from the culture product, the reaction mixture, or the cell removed liquid thereof are used as an active ingredient, the resultant hair tonic composition has a strong Sa reductase inhibitory activity. According to the experiment system adopted by the inventors, the recovered products containing the fatty acids isolated from the culture products have a 50 inhibitory concentration IC50 value of 0.20 mM against Sa reductase. These fatty acids can inhibit 50 of the activity of the Sa reductase in a concentration of 0.02 to 0.04 . The hair tonic composition according to the present invention can accelerate the growth of hair and alleviate the generation of dandruff and itching in the scalp due to the fact that the active ingredients thereof have the above mentioned Sa reductase inhibitory activity or both the above mentioned lipase acitivity and Sa reductase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the microflora of the scalp is maintained in or brought to a healthy state by the fatty acids contained in the hair tonic composition according to the present invention these fatty acids are formed by the interaction of the above mentioned fungi with the fats and oils and or the fatty acids formed by decomposing the lipids from the sebaceous gland with the lipase contained in the hair tonic composition according to the present invention. It is considered that when these actions or functions are combined or multiplied, they exhibit a strong hair growth acceleration effect. The hair tonic composition according to the present invention has the Sa reductase inhibitory activity or both the Sa reductase inhibitory activity and the lipase activity as mentioned above, and when the hair tonic composition according to the present invention is applied to the human scalp or animal skins, strong hair growth acceleration effects can be provided. That is, when the hair tonic composition according to the present invention is applied to the human scalp, the depilation and epilation can be effectively alleviated, downy hairs become healthy, and the generation of dandruff and itching in the scalp can be prevented. Furthermore, when the hair tonic composition of the present invention is applied to animals, the growth velocity of the hair fur is remarkably increased. The nonpathogenicity of the hair tonic composition according to the present invention has been confirmed.That is, the above mentioned culture product and the purified fatty acids recovered therefrom were independently dispersed in an ethanol and the mixtures were spread on the skins of five rabbits once a day for 3 days in each dispersion. The ethanol was also spread in the same manner as acontrol. As a result, no abnormal condition was found in each case, as shown inTable 1. Table 1 Test dispersion Irritation score Control 0 0.2 aqueous alcohol solution of the culture product 0 0.02 aqueous alcohol solution of the fatty acid fractions 0 EXAMPLES The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples, in which the preparation, application, and effect of the hair tonic composition of the present invention are specifically disclosed.

Rhizopus delemar ATCC 34612 cells were inoculated into the above culture medium 1 x 107 spores liter and this was aerobically precultured at a temperature of 270C for 4 days under agitation. A 100 liter amount of the liquid culture medium having the same composition as mentioned above was charged into a fermentor a charge capacity of 100 liters , and 5 liters of olive oil was then added to the liquid culture medium. After the liquid culture medium was sterilized at a temperature of 1200C for 15 minutes, 10 liters of the precultured product was added to the sterilized medium and was aerobically cultivated at a temperature of 270C for 94 hours while stirring. A portion of the culture product was filtered by using Celite as a filter aid, whereby hyphae were removed therefrom. Thus, the filtrate was obtained. A 10 g amount of sodium chloride was dissolved in 100 ml of the filtrate obtained above and 100 ml of ethyl acetate was added thereto. The mixture was thoroughly stirred and the separated ethyl acetate layer was recovered. The ethyl acetate layer was concentrated to dryness. The resultant residue was dissolved in methanol and the methanol solution was again concentrated to dryness. The residue thus obtained was dissolved in benzene The benzene solution was treated with silica gel column chromatography. The elution was carried out by using benzene, a mixture of benzene and chloroform 1 1 V V , and chloroform, in that order. The chloroform eluate was concentrated to obtain the active ingredient containing fatty acids.

The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract was developed twice by silica gel thin layer chromatography solvent system, dichloromethane cyclohexane acetone 15 4 1 . The amount of Sa dihydrotestosterone were determined from the intensities of the radioactivity.
