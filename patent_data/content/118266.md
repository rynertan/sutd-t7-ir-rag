# Automatic tape laying apparatus.

## Abstract
Automatic tape laying apparatus for laying epoxy resin impregnated carbon fibre tape includes a table 6, 7 onto which lengths of tape are laid for profiling to shape and size, a curved form tool 4, 41 on which the profiled lengths of tape are laid up to form an article to be cured, a roller 12 to transfer the profiled lengths from the table to the tool and to effect laying up thereon, the roller having suction ducts 33, 34 on its surface to hold the lengths of tape in place during transfer which suction is progressively de activated and replaced with blowing as the roller is rolled over the form tool and progressively lays up the profiled tape onto the tool.
