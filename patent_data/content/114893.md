# BUILD UP WELDING METHOD.

## Abstract
A build up welding method for the inner surfaces of chemical reaction containers has the step of preferentially padding a welding metal layer of an austenite series stainless steel of special composition with a delta ferrite phase, as an intermediate layer prior to the build up welding of a surface layer of stainless steel or nickel alloy over a base material of carbon steel or low alloy steel, so as to prevent exfoliation or cracking in the boundary between the build up welding metal and the base material. As can be seen from Figures 1, 2, the composition contains a ratio Creq Nieq of nickel equivalent to chromium equivalent of at least 1.85 to prevent exfoliation or cracking, and less than 26 chromium equivalent and less than 20 delta ferrite phase thereby, in particular, preventing bending ductility. This method is adapted for lining the inner surfaces of a chemical reaction container, such as a petroleum refining desulfurizing reactor, which is used under high temperatures and in a high pressure hydrogen environment.
