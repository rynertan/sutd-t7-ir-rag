# Device for widthwise control of web material and method.

## Abstract
A device for widthwise control of web material, compris es bar structure having resiliently bendable beam means 62 for effecting a primary bowed adjustment. A set of side by side independent but cooperative wrap area members 61 are carried by the beam means and are adapted to be individually selectively adjustable relative to the beam means to effect secondary adjustments incrementally at any of the members, without altering the primary bow relation, for correctionally compensating for uneven tension in any part of the web material, such as may be caused by web thickness, bulk or length.
