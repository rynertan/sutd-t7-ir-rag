## Description
SEMI REFINED MIXED DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS This invention relates to a process for the recovery of semi refined mixed dicarboxylic acids and more particularly to the recovery of mixed adipic, glutaric and succinic acids from a mother liquor, or a partially evaporated mother liquor, containing said dicarboxylic acids together with catalyst residues and impurities. Production of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids by the oxidation of cycloparaffins is of considerable commercial importance because of the availability of cycloparaffins and the widespread use of such acids in the manufacture of synthetic resins. An example is the production of adipic acid, an intermediate for nylon 6,6, by the oxidation of cyclohexane. In the manufacture of adipic acid, it has been found preferable to oxidize cyclohexane in a two step oxidation process, i.e. to oxidize cyclohexane with air to a mixture containing cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and to thereafter oxidize at leaslt a portion of that mixture using nitric acid to a mixture of mono and di carboxylic acids in an aqueous nitric acid solution, for example, as described by C.H.Hamblet and A. McAlevy in U.S. 2 557 282, which issued 1951June 19. Copper and ot vanadium catalysts may be used in the nitric acid oxidation step. After crystallization of a portion of the adipic acid from this mixture, at least a part of the mother liquor remaining is subjected to evaporating conditions to reduce the nitric acid concentration of the liquor.Further crystallization of the adipic acid is then effected.The mother liquor from the second crystallization contains adipic, glutaric and succinic acids together with catalyst residues and impurities including nitric acid. Separation of additional amounts of adipic acid from the mother liquor may be difficult because of co crystallization of succinic acid. Various processes have been proposed heretofore to recover some of the useful components from this mother liquor .or from the mixture remaining after evaporation to reduce the nitric acid concentration. Canadian Patent 707 340 of Gilby,Hoberg and Phibbs, issued 1965 April 06, describes the separation by distillation of succinic and glutaric acids from adipic acid as anhydrides. Canadian Patent 955 876 ofAdamek, issued 1974 October 08, describes a process in which a mixture of adipic, succinic and glutaric acids is treated with ammonia in less than the stoichiometric amount required for complete ammoniation. The imides of the succinic and glutaric acids are then separated by distillation from the adipic acid. In another known process a mixture of adipic, succinic and glutaric acids is reacted with methanol and the mixed esters so produced are distilled overhead as a useful product. Some of the above prior art processes are expensive to operate. In another process there is insufficient demand for the product to utilize all of the mother liquor which is available. It has been established that a market could exist for a low cost semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids, provided that said mixture when reacted with ethylene glycol and or diethylene glycol, produces a low molecular weight polyester having an acceptable colour level e.g. not more than about 5 on the so called Gardner scale i.e. a light brown colour. In the Gardner Varnish ColourSystem of the Institute of Paint and Varnish Research ASTM D 154 the larger the number, the darker the colour. One, the lowest number on the Gardner scale, corresponds to a colour of 270 in the Platinum Cobalt APEA system ASTM D 1209 . It has now been found that such a semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids may be produced from an aqueous mixture of such acids, catalyst residues and impurities, by dehydration followed by the evaporation of the mixed acids from the dehydrated mixture in an evaporating means, provided that prior to the dehydration step a reducing agent selected from the group consisting of hypophosphorous acid and sodium hypophosphite is added to the aqueous mixture. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for recovering a semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids from an aqueous mixture derived from a process for the oxidation of cyclohexane to dicarboxylic acids, said mixture comprising said acids together with catalyst residues and impurities, the process comprising the steps of a adding to the aqueous mixture a reducing agent selected from the group consisting of hypo phosphorous acid and sodium hypophosphite b concentrating the resulting aqueous mixture by the removal of water to produce a substantial ly dehydrated mixture and c feeding the substantially dehydrated mixture to an evaporating means and evaporating there from a mixture of adipic, glutaric and succin ic acids. In an embodiment of the process of present invention the recovered semi refined mixture of adipic glutaric and succinic acids is capable of being reacted with ethylene glycol and or diethylene glycol to produce a low molecular weight polyester having a colour level of not more than about 5 on the Gardner scale. In another embodiment of the process of present invention, the evaporating step c is carried out in a wiped film evaporator. In yet another embodiment of the process of the present invention, both the evaporating step c and the concentrating step b are carried out in a wiped film evaporator. Yet another embodiment of the process of the present invention includes the additional steps of d condensing the mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids evaporated from the evaporating means in step c , as a molten material and e feeding the molten material to a flaker to produce a product in flake form. In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the reducing agent is hypophosphorous acid present in an amount of 0.5 to 2.0 percent by weight of the aqueous mixture. In a still further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphite present in an amount 1.0 to 4.0 percent by weight of the aqueous mixture. The present invention also provides a semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids, said mixture being capable of being reacted with ethylene glycol and or diethylene glycol to produce a low molecular weight polyester having a colour level of not more that about 5 on the Gardner scale, said mixture having been produced from an aqueous mixture derived from a process for the oxidation of cyclohexane to dicarboxylic acids, said mixture comprising said acids together with catalyst residues and impurities by a process comprising the steps of a adding to the aqueous mixture a reducing agent selected from the group consisting of hypo phosphorous acid and sodium hypophosphite b concentrating the resulting aqueous mixture by the removal of water to produce a substantial ly dehydrated mixture and c feeding the substantially dehydrated mixture to an evaporating means and evaporating there from a mixture of adipic, glutaric and succin ic acids. In another embodiment of the semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids of the present invention, said mixture contains less than 500 parts per million by weight of phosphorus. As hereinbefore described the present invention provides a process for the recovery of a semi refined mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids from an aqueous mixture of such acids together with impurities. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the aqueous mixture of dicarboxylic acids is in the form of a partially concentrated mother liquor. The mother liquor may be obtained as waste from the adipic acid recovery steps of a process for the manufacture of adipic acid by the oxidation of cyclohexane.Such mother liquors may contain monobasic acids, catalyst residues from a previous stage of the process, and other impurities, for example nitric acid and nitrogen containing colour forming materials, for example, nitroaliphatic acids. The aqueous mixture of dicarboxylic acids obtained as hereinbefore described may, according to the present invention, be first treated with a suitable reducing agent and then fed to a concentrating means, for example, an evaporator, preferably a wiped film evaporator. In the concentrating means , the mixture may be substantially dehydrated by the removal of water and nitric acid. The substantially dehydrated mixturem a y then be fed toTh an evaporating means, especiallywá wiped film evaporator, for the evaporation therefrom of a mixture of adipic glutaric and succinic acids. The mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids evaporated from the evaporating means, if desired, may be condensed as a molten material and fed to a flaker to produce a product in flake form.The tails from the evaporating means, which contain residual dicarboxylic acids, catalyst residues and high boiling impurities, may be purged to waste, for example, by burning. It will be appreciated that if a storage tank is provided for the substantially dehydrated mixture from the concentrating means, a single wiped film evaporator may be employed, in turn, as the concentrating means and as the evaporating means. The reducing agent may be added in a feed storage tank or it may be added directly to the feed stream to the concentrating means. The reducing agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of hypophosphorous acid and sodium hypophosphite. If the reducing agent is hypophosphorous acid it preferably should be present in an amount of 0.5 to 2.0 percent by weight of the aqueous mixture fed to the concentrating means. If the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphite it preferably should be present in amount of 1.0 to 4.0 percent by weight of the aqueous mixture. The preferred wall temperature range for the concentrating means, for example, a wiped film evaporator, is from 150 to 1900C and in particular 160 to 1800C. The preferred operating pressure range for the concentrating means, for example a wiped film evaporator, is from 150 to 600 mm of mercury absolute 20 80 kPa and in particular from 200 to 400 mm of mercury absolute 26.7 53.3 kPa . The preferred wall temperature range for the evaporating means, for example a wiped film evaporator, is from 200 to 260 C and in particular, from 215 to 250 C. The preferred operating pressure range for the evaporating means, for example a wiped film evaporator, is from 5 to 25 mm of mercury absolute 0.67 3.3 Pa and in particular from 5 to 15 mm o merury absolute 0.67 2.kPa , the lower limit usually being determined by the limitations of the process equipment. In the evaporation step, it is preferred that from 80 to 95 percent by weight of the substantially dehydrated mixture be evaporated as adipic, glutaric and succinic acid. The present invention may be further illustrated by the following examples Example 1 0.95 ml. of 50 by weight hypophosphorous acid was added to 118 g of an aqueous mixture having the following approximate composition adipic acid 11 by weight, glutaric acid 50 by weight, succinic acid 19 by weight, water 20 by weight, nitric acid 0.1 by weight, copper 100 parts per million and vanadium 350 parts per million.
