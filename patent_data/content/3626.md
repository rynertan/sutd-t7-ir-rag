# Injection laser.

## Abstract
Injection laser in which the laser beam can be moved in a plane parallel to the injecting P N junction. On one side of this scanning spot laser the electrical contact is divided into two strip shaped sub contacts which are juxtaposed with respect to the laser beam. The two sub contact regions are separated from each other by a gap which extends mainly in the same direction as the laser beam. The sub contacts may be provided, for example, on the substrate side while a heat sink is mounted on the other side.
