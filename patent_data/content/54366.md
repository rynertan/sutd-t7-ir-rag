## Description
Novel Surface Active Agents and Compositions Comprising Them THIS INVENTION relates to novel surface active agents and compositions comprising them. A number of surface active acetals obtained by condensing alkyl monoethers of polyethylene glycols with aliphatic aldehydes have been investiaged by B Burczyk and A Sokolowski,Tenside Detergents 15 1978 page 2. They show certain materials of this type were likely to be easily biodegradable and have low foaming properties. The materials which they investigated had a total of hydrophobic carbon atoms by which is meant the sum of the carbon atoms in the aldehyde and both alkyl groups in the range 3 to 8. Unfortunately the performance of acetals of this type in practical detergent compositions which include builders is poor. We have found that a novel group of acetals shows good performance in practical detergent compositions containing builders. The novel compounds of this invention have the formulaEMI1.1 where R is an alkyl group having 11 to 19 carbon atoms and RÚ and R11 are individually alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The groupsX and X1 are individually alkylene oxide or polyalkylene oxide residues having 1 to 15 alkylene oxide residues in each. These may be ethylene oxide or propylene oxide residues or both as random or block copolymers. It is preferred that the total number of carbon atoms in the groups R, RÚ and RÚÚ should be in the range 15 to 22 and that the total carbon atom content of the molecule should be in the range 32 to 60 carbon atoms. The compounds according to the invention may be made by reacting a monalkyl ether of a glycol or polyglycol with an aliphatic aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst, for example phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid or p toluenesulphonic acid in a concentfation of for example 0.1 to 2 and preferably 0.5 to 1 by weight. The temperature is suitably 3 to 200 C for example 60 to 1500C. Water is liberated in the course of the reaction and may be removed by operating under vacuum and distilling the water off or by operating in the presence of an immiscible azeotroping agent for example toluene, cyclohexane or a xylene. The reactants are suitably in stoichimetric proportions though the glycol ether may be present in up to a 50 excess if desired. Detergent compositions comprising the novel compounds suitably include a builder for example a phosphate for example sodium tr ipolyphosphate, nitrilotriacetic acid or a zeolite.EXAMPLE Compounds according to the invention were prepared as follows A mixed C13 , to C aldehyde 675 by weight C13 and 335 by 1, 15 weight C15 consisting of 50 straight chain aldehydes and 50 2 methyl branched aldehydes 850 grams was added with 1,200 grams methanol and 0.5 grams of concentrated hydrochloric acid specific gravity 1.18 to a 3 litre vessel and maintained at 45 to 550C for 15 hours, at the end of which time the reaction was judged to have reached completion based on the reduction in intensity of the carbonyl peak as monitored by infra red spectroscopy. Ca OH 2 10 grams was added to neutralise the hydrochloric acid. Excess methanol and water were then removed by distillation and the product was filtered. The product has an estimated aldehyde content of 1,51 by weight, a water content of 0.3 by weight and a methanol content of 0.5 by volume. The product consisted essentially of the dimethyl acetal of the mixed aldehyde. Some of this dimethyl acetal 387 grams and the product of condensing 1 mole of methanol with 6 moles of ethylene oxide 873 grams were charged into a 2 litre flask fitted with a side arm condenser and stirred under an atmosphere of nitrogen.Hydrochloric acid 8 grams specific gravity of 1.18 was added dropwise and the flask was heated to 100 150 C until no more methanol distillate was collected. The product was neutralised with Ca OH 2 30 grams to give a pH after neutralisation of 8.5. The product was filteredthrough keiselguhr to give a clear yellowy orange liquid of formula EMI3.1 where R is an alkyl group derived from the mixed aldehyde and e and p average 6. It is referred to hereinafter as product 1 . A further product according to the invention was made as follows The dimethyl acetal of the mixed aldehyde 258 grams and the product pf condensing 1 mole of methanol with 10 moles of ethylene oxide 912.2 grams was fed into a flask and stirred and concentrated hydrochloric acid 5 grams, specific gravity of 1.18 was added dropwise. The flask was heated with stirring under nitrogen to remove methanol of reaction. After 5 hours at a flask temperature of 100 to 150 C the stoichiometric amount of methanol had been collected. The product was a homogeneous orangey yellow liquid. A 10 solution in normal hexane was shown by gas liquid chromatography to be free from aldehyde and the dimethyl acetal. The weight of the crude product was 1080 grams. Ca OH 2 20 grams was added to the crude product which was stirred under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 2 hours. The neutralised product was filtered through keiselguhr to give a clear yellow orange liquid which was of formulaEMI3.2 where R is derived from the mixed aldehyde and m and n average 10.It is referred to hereinafter as product 2. Product 1, product 2 and a corresponding product prepared by similar means but in which e and p average 3 product 3 were tested with comparison with standard alcohol ethyoxylates which were the condensation products of 1 mole of a mixed alcohol which was 67 by weight C13 alcohol and 33 by weight C15 alcohol 50 linear and 50 2 methyl branched with respectively 7 and 9 moles ethylene oxide hereinafter referred to as ethyoxylate 7 and 9 respectively . The above products were tested by placing 3 pieces of uniformly Krefeld soiled cotton or polyester cotton cloth and 1 piece of clean cotton cloth 10 by 7.5 cm rectangles in 1 litre of water 50 parts per million hardness expressed as calcium carbonate containing in the case of the results of Table 1, 2.5 grams of the stated surfactant and in the case of Tables 2 and 3, 5 grams of the compositions indicated in the following table, and washing at 600C in a US Testing Company Tergotometer model 7243 . The cloths were rinsed in cold water and ironed and their reflectance before and after washing was measured in a Gardner reflectometer.EMI4.1 tb SEP Composition SEP type SEP tb SEP Component SEP TYPE SEP A SEP TYPE SEP B tb SEP 1 SEP 2 SEP 3 SEP 4 SEP 5 SEP 1.

The products are thus suitable for low foaming surfactant compositions. As indicated by the foregoing examples, compounds according to the invention may be made by reacting a monoalkyl ether of a glycol or polyglycol with an acetal of an aliphatic aldehyde with an alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the presence of an acid catalyst, for example phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid or p toluene sulphonic acid in a concentration of for example 0.1 to 2 and preferably 0.5 to 15 by weight. The temperature is suitably 5 to 2000C for example 60 to 1500C. The alcohol is liberated from the acetal in the course of the reaction and may be removed by distillation during the reaction. The reactants are suitably in stoichiometric proportions though the glycol ether may be present in up to a 506 excess if desired.
