# Alkali metal zirconofluorophosphate glasses.

## Abstract
Glasses within the Li₂O K₂O ZrO₂ F P₂O₅ system having batch compositions as generally depicted in terms of mole per cent in FIGURE 2 have improved properties. A particular glass has the approximate stoichiometry, on a chemically analyzed basis of Zr
