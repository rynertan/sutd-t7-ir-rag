# Bottle closure.

## Abstract
A bottle closure 1 designed to make apparent any previous opening of a bottle consists of a cap 3 a collar 4 extending coaxially in elongation of the cap and a line of weakness 8 between the cap and the collar. A number of resilient tabs 23 project inwardly from the collar 4 and are arranged close to the line of weakness so that they engage in a circumferential recess 15 made on the inside of the cap 3 in proximity to the line of weakness 8 , so that the tabs serve as a bridge across the line of weakness 8 . Once the cap 3 has been removed the tabs 23 snap out of the recess 15 and cannot be re engaged therein, so that a fissure opens up between the cap 3 and the collar indicating that the cap has been removed.
