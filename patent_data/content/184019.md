# Thermostable alpha amylase producing, thermophilic anaerobic bacteria, thermostable alpha amylase and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
The bacterium producing thermostable α amylases of this invention is an anaerobic bacterium belonging to Clostridium. The thermostable α amylases of this invention is novel α amylases which are excellent in thermostability and acid resistance and have a slight calcium requirement. Said α amylases are obtained by culturing the aforesaid bacteria and collecting the α amylases from the culture. When the aforesaid α amylase is used, sugar production process can be greatly rationalized.
