# COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING AND METHODS OF USE OF AN INFECTIVITY CURED HR PLASMID BEARING MICROORGANISM

## Abstract
A novel agriculturally useful composition that includes a seed treated with a selected infectivity cured Hr plasmid bearing microorganism. Also provided are methods of enhancing root elongation, shoot elongation or root de velopment of selected seeds. These methods include treat ing a selected seed with the infectivity cured Hr plasmid bearing microorganism. In addition, there is provided a method of inducing germination of grass seed that involves treating a grass seed such as Kentucky bluegrass seed with a selected infectivity cured Hr plasmid bearing microorgan ism. Furthermore, there is provided a method of promoting plant growth at a lower soil temperature than is common at the time of planting a seed of the plant. Additionally, there is disclosed an inoculant for increasing nodulation, root mass and shoot mass in a leguminous plant. The inoculant contains a Rhizoobium microorganism and a selected infectiv ity cured HR plasmid bearing microorganism. Also, there is provided an agriculturally useful composition containing a suitable seed treated with this inoculant.
