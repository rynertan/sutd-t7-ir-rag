# Arc spray fabrication of metal matrix composite monotape.

## Abstract
Arc metal spraying is used to spray liquid metal onto an ar ray of high strength fibers 10 that have been previously wound onto a large drum 12 contained inside a controlled at mosphere chamber 18 . This chamber is first evacuated to remove gaseous contaminants and then backfilled with a neutral gas up to atmospheric pressure. This process is used to produce a large size metal matrix composite monotape.
