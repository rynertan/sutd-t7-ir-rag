# Magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and method utilizing a composite RF pulse.

## Abstract
In an imaging apparatus and a method for producing a two dimensional image of an object under medical examina tion, a composite selective RF pulse is produced in a transmit ter unit. The composite selective RF pulse is constituted of a second RF 90 and a third RF 90 pulse. Under the control of a system processor, the second RF 90 pulse is firstly ap plied to the object and the third RF 90 pulse is secondly applied thereto under the same polarity of the field gradient after providing an time interval.
