## Abstract
A counting apparatus comprises a signaling divice 76 responsive to movement of a lever 28 for producing a detactable signal, the lever 28 being movable in response to passage thereby of at least a portion of an object which is of a size falling within a predetermined range of sizes. The counting apparatus is characterized by the provision of a coupling and resetting structure 68, 72 coupled intermedi ate the lever 28 and the signaling divice 76 for transmit ting movement of the lever 28 to the signaling device 76 and for automatically resetting both the lever 28 and the signaling device 76 in response to a predetermined minimum incremental decrease in the size of a portion of an object passing by the lever 28 following the initial move ment thereof and responsive production of a signal.
