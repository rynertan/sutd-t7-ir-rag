# Polymerized solutions of an oxide method of preparation thereof method of preparing alkoxyde coatings on substrates, such as solar cells, and product so obtained.

## Abstract
A clear solution is prepared by reacting metal alkoxi de with a mixture of critical amounts of water and or acid in an alcohol diluted medium. Alkoxides may be Ti OR ₄ or Ta OR ₅, or another metal alkoxide such as Si OR ₄ in ad mixture with these alkoxides. Acids may be HCl or HNO₃. Quarter wave inorganic optical coatings are deposited by applying the alkoxide solution to a substrate then heating the coating at over 350 C. The coatings reduce reflectivity on silicon solar cells. The index of refraction of the coating can be varied by several techniques, including altering the proportion of titanium and silicon in the coating firing tem perature, firing atmosphere. Thicknesses of the coating can be controlled by varying the rpm in spin application, withdrawal rate in dipping application, by concentration of the solution, by the type of solvent or the degree of poly merization of the titanium complexes.
