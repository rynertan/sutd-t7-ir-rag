# Television standards converters.

## Abstract
A television standards converter comprises three field stores 14, 15, 16 and four 4 line stores 17 to 20 for receiving an input digital television signal of one standard and deriving therefrom arrays of sixteen lines, each array consisting of four successive lines from each of four successive fields of the input television signal, a weighting coefficient store 63 for storing sets of sixteen weighting coefficients, respective sets corresponding to positions both spatial and temporal of respective lines of an output digital television signal of a different standard, relative to the sixteen lines of the input television signal, two interpolation filters 22,23 for deriving line by line the output television signal by multiplying corresponding sample values from each of the sixteen lines of the input television signal by a respective weighting coefficient in a set of weighting coefficients and summing the resulting products to form an interpolated sample value, and four output field stores 26 to 29 for receiving and storing the derived lines of the output television signal and from which the output television signal is read.
