# Pivoted actuator switch with lock.

## Abstract
A miniature toggle switch having an actuator 20 pivotally mounted in a base 2 for operating contacts 8, 10, 12, 16 . A switch lock is provided by a one piece leaf spring 34 press in mounted at one end in a slot 20f in a side ledge of the actuator so that its other end abuts a shoulder 2g in the base to lock the switch in one position. This lock spring is provided with a knee bend 34c that sticks out beyond and below the actuator ledge 20d in which it is mounted. A removable operating lever 26 has a pair of hooks 26a, 26b for snap on mounting it on the side ledges of the actuator. One of these hooks engages the knee bend 34c of the lock spring to bias it clear of the shoulder 2g to allow normal switch operation. A lamp 28 is mounted in the bottom of the base and extends up through a hole 20c in the actuator to light the operating lever 26 as an indication.
