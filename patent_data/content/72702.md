# A confinement chamber for use in farrowing.

## Abstract
A confinement chamber 11 for use in farrowing is disclosed. The confinement chamber 11 has upright side front and rear walls and the front wall 12 has an opening 22 with an entrance closure comprising a flap 24 or an array of pivoted fingers, which allows piglets to enter the enclosure but prevents their escape. A ramp 26 or other piglet conveying means is positioned between the sow and the entrance to convey piglets into the chamber 11 as they are born. A ventilated cover 33 retains heat to maintain a suitable temperature within the chamber.
