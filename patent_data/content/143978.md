# Process for making low crystallinity polyolefins.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a solution polymerization process for obtaining high yields of high molecular weight, low crystal linity polymers of propylene and higher 1 olefins at low catalyst levels. The polymerization is carried out using a catalyst system containing a soluble transition metal compo nent derived from magnesium carboxylate and a salt of titanium, zirconium or hafnium, and specified alkyl alumi num halide activators.
