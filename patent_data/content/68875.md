## Description
FLUORESCENT CHELTES AND L ELED SPECIFIC BINDING REAGENTS PREPARED THEREFROM The present invention relates to fluorescent chelates and, more particularly, to fluorescent chelates useful for the preparation of specific binding reagents including fluorescent labeled physiologically active materials. In specific binding assays, sensitivity is of prime importance owing to the generally low analyte levels that are measured. In fluorescence spectroscopy assays, a sample containing a fluorescent species to be analyzed is irradiated with light of known spectral distribution within the excitation spectrum of the target fluorescent species. The intensity of the resulting characteristic emission spectrum of the fluorescent target molecules is determined and is related to the number of target molecules. The sensitivity of fluorescence assays, although theoretically very high, is limited by the presence of background fluorescence. Background signal levels are picked up from competing fluorescent substances, not only in the sample, but also in materials containing the sample. This is an especially serious problem in quantitative measurements of species associated with samples containing low concentrations of desired target fluorescent molecules, such as are found in biological fluids. In many situations, it is impossible to reduce the background sufficiently by appropriate filtration and other techniques known in the art to obtain the desired sensitivity. Time resolution offers an independent aswans of isolating the specific fluorescent signal of interest from nonspecific background fluorescence.Time resolution is possible if the label has much longer lived fluorescence than the background, and if the system is illuminated by an intermittent light source such that the long lived label is measureable during the dark period subsequent to the decay of the short lived background. Such techniques are described in greater detail in German Offenlegungsschrift 2,628,158. The long lived fluorescence 0.1 5 msec of the aromatic diketone chelates of certain rare earth metals, for example, europiumbenzoylacetonate and europiumbenzoyltrifluoracetonate, has been known for some time. The chelating agent absorbs light and transfers it to the metal ion, which fluoresces.German OLS 2,628,158 describes the use of time resolution in fluoroinetric immunoassays FIA through the use of fluorescent labels whose emissions are long lived as compared with those of species which produce background interferences in such assays.This publication also provides a useful discussion of the techniques of FIA and its advantage over other immunoassay techniques such as radioimmunoassay RIA . The fluorescent immunoreagents described inGerman OLS 2,628,158 comprise at least one member of the immune system, i.e., an antibody or an antigen, conjugated with a rare earth chelate. Such conjugation can be achieved in one of two ways 1 first, by labeling, i.e., attaching the rare earth chelate to the antigen as described inFluorescent Antibody Techniques and Their Application by A. Kawamura, Ed., University Park Press,Baltimore, Maryland, 1969, and then adding antibody to the conjugated antigen whereby the antibody and antigen join in the usual fashion, or 2 by covalently bonding the antibody to the chelate via a chemical group. The problem with immunoreagents of the type described in German OLS 2,628,158 is that the fluorescent labeling species, namely, the rare earth chelates, are quenched, i.e., their fluorescence is extinguished, when contacted with water. This problem, hereinafter referred to as an aqueous stability problem, is particularly serious because a principal use for fluorescent labeled immunoreagents is in the assay of aqueous biological liquids, such as blood and serum. If aqueous stability could be conferred on these materials, they would be useful as fluorescent labels for these biological liquids, thus allowing increased fluorescence immunoassay sensitivity by the use of time resolution of signal from background. Further, rare earth chelates previously used for fluorometric measurements have had undesirable properties, such as a low quantum yield for emission, undesirable sensitizer extinction coefficients which result in insufficient fluorescence using small quantities of detectable species, low Amax which renders the determination subject to interference from other components in the sample that are usually in the low Amax range, poor water solubility most biological fluids are aqueous , and poor stability of the chelate at low concentrations. The present invention is directed to fluorescent chelates of a lanthanide metal and a chelating agent, the chelating agent including amoiety that is a triplet sensitizer having a triplet energy greater than that of the lanthanide metal and at least two heteroatom containing groups and a third heteroatom containing group or heteroatom that is in or appended to said moiety, each of said two heteroatom containing groups appended to different carbon atoms of the triplet sensitizer moiety, the heteroatom containing groups being located in the chelating agent such that they and said third heteratom or heteroatom containing group form a chelate structure with the lanthanide metal. The chelates are water soluble, stable at low concentrations at a pH in the range of 8 to 10, highly sensitive, and have favorable molar extinction coefficients 10,000 40,000 , and favorable Amax e.g., greater than 300 nm and, preferably, greater than 330 nm, which permits use of a white light source. These chelates have binding constants greater than 1010 M 1. Accordingly, the present invention provides a class of highly efficient, aqueous stabilized fluorescent chelates for labeling physiologically active materials, such as antigens and hormones. The present invention also provides a new class of specific binding reagents, such as antigens, enzymes, and hormones, bearing these highly useful fluorescent labels. The fluorescent chelates of the present invention exhibit satisfactory aqueous stability, that is, they exhibit a binding constant greater than iso10 Mrl i.e. the log10 of the binding constant is greater than 10 . This binding constant refers to the binding of the chelating agent to the lanthanide metal The reagents are formed by adsorbing or covalently binding the fluorescent labeled antigens, haptens, antibodies, plant pectins, carbohydrates, hormones, enzymes and other such species specific materials. Generally, any lanthanide metal is useful in the chelates described herein. Examples of lanthanide metals useful herein are europium and terbium and are described by Sinha, S.P., Complexes of Rare Earths, Pergamon Press, 1966. The sensitizer moiety of the chelating agent is any triplet sensitizer having the requisite triplet energy. Examples of triplet sensitizers useful herein include ketones, such as benzophenone, propiophenone, Michler s ketone, acetophenone, 1,3 , 5 triacetylbenzene, isobutyrophenone, 1 ,3 diphenyl 2 propanone, triphenylmethyl phenyl ketone, 1,2 dibenzoylbenzene, 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone, 1,4 diacetylbenzene, 9 benzoylfluorene, p cyanobenzophenone, ss naphthyl phenyl ketone, 2 acetonaphthone, a naphthyl phenyl ketone and l acetonaphthone, including a,ss diketones such as biacetyl, benzil and 2,3 pentanedione a ketoaromatic compound, such as xanthone, thioxanthone, anthraquinone, a naphthoflavone, flavone, 5 ,12 naph thacenequinone and fluorenone an aldehyde, such as benzaldehyde, phenylglyoxal, ethyl phenyiglyoxalate, 2 naphthaldehyde and l naphthaldehye a linear or fused polycyclic aromatic compound, such as fluorene, triphenylene, phenanthrene, naphthalene and pyrene heterocyclic and aromatic nitrogen containing compounds, such as carbazole, terpyridines, phenanthroline, triphenylamine, thiazolines, especially 2 organocarbonylthiazolines, such as 2 benzoylmethylene 1 methylnaphtho 1,2 d thiazoline, 2 furoylmethylene l methylnaphtho 1, 2 djthiazoline, 2 difuroylmethylene l methylnaphtho l,2 djthiazaline, l methyl 2 thenoylmethylenenaphthotl,2 d khiazoline and 2 dithenoylmethylene l methylnaphtho l ,2 d thiazoline thiazoline compounds, as described inU.S. Patents 2,732,301 and 4,119,466 and ketocoumarins, such as described in U.S. Patent 4,147,552. When the lanthanide metal is europium, the triplet energy must be at least 47 Kcal, and if the lanthanide metal is terbium, the triplet energy of the nucleus must be at least 53 Kcal. The chelating agent also has at least two heteroatom containing groups that are located on the chelating agent such that they are capable of forming coordinate bonds with lanthanide mentals. Groups capable of forming coordinate bonds with lanthanide metals include nitrilodiacetate, carboxy, hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, amido, carbonyl, and mercapto groups.These groups are appended to the nucleus so as to allow chelation of the groups with the lanthanide metal. Preferred chelating agents have the structure EMI6.1 wherein Z together with Rê represents the atoms necessary to complete a substituted such as with a group used to link up the immunoreagent such as ureylene, thioureylene, carbonylimino or imino linked to an immunoreagent, or a coumarin group or unsubstituted moiety that is a triplet sensitizer having a triplet energy greater than that of the lanthanide metal R2 is 1 a heteroatom or 2 an alkylene including alkenylene group having at least one hctero atom therein or a heteroatom or heteroatom.containlng group appended thereto and R and R4 are heteroatom containing groups that are the same or different R and i being in sufficient proximity to ac so that the lanthanide metal is chelatable to Rê,R3 and R4 wherein the number of carbon and heteroatoms represented by R is equal to or less than 20. R2 is a heteroatom, such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or selenium, or an alkylene including alkenylene group. having therein at least one heteroatom or a heteroatom or heteroatom containIn group appended thereto. Thus, Rê can comprise one or more heteroatoms. Examples of R2 are NH , O, S, Se, N ,EMI7.1 and a heteroatom or a heteroatom containing alkylene group of up to 10 carbon atoms. Further examples are carbonyl, dicarbonyl, thiocarbonyl, hydroxymethylene, 1,2 dihydroxyethylene and 1,2 dihydroxyvinylene. It is preferred that Rs and RI be either individually adjacent to R2, or three or less atoms removed from R2. In one preferred embodiment, the lanthanide metal is chelated with a phenol having iminodiacetate groups substituted in each position ortho to the phenolic hydroxy group. The phenol is unsubstituted or substituted with a variety of groups, such as alkoxy, alkyl, halogen, or carbonyl, and is optionally fused to another aromatic group or to an alicyclic or heterocyclic group. Especially preferred are compounds having the structure EMI7.2 wherein M is hydrogen or a cation, such as ammonium or its derivatives, such as tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, or benzyltrimethylammonium, or an alkali aetal, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, rubidium, or cesium and D represents the atoms necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring. This aromatic ring must bear a hydroxyl group as shown above.In addition, it must bear a carbonyl group such asEMI8.1 where alkyl generally contains up to 10 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, or isomers thereof and Ar is aryl, such as phenyl or it must be fused at two of its available positions to another aromatic, alicyclic, or hete ocyclic ring preferably containing from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, such as benzene substituted or unsubstituted , benzophenone, or pyran which bears a carbonyl group to form a coumarin nucleus.Examples of the aromatic ring are phenyl, naphthyl, and the like, optionally substituted in any of the available positions with alkyl, preferably containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, or butyl or isomers thereof hydroxy aryl, such as phenyl aldehyde groups such as CHO or benzoyl groups, such as EMI8.2 In especially preferred embodiments, D completes a phenyl ring with a carbonyl substituent, such as a benzoyl substituent or it completes a coumarin group. Throughout the specification the terms alkyl and ,aryl11 include substituted alkyl and aryl. Particularly useful substituent groups include methyl, ethyl, and propyl. A preferred embodiment of the invention involves the formation of a chelate of a lanthanide petal with a salt or acid having the following structure EMI9.1 wherein M is hydrogen, ammonium, or an alkali metal ion, or any other suitable cation that renders the salt water soluble. In another preferred embodiment, the organic compound that complexes with the lanthanide metal has the following structure EMI9.2 wherein Rs is preferably aroyl such as EMI9.3 and each Rs is independently selected from hydrogen alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, or butyl aryl or aroyl with or without further substitution alkoxy, such as methoxy and propoxy or halogen, such as bromine or chlorine. The preferred aroyl R5 substituent is optionally further substituted with aryl or alkyl groups, or with ester, amide, carbamide, thiocarbamide, isocyanate, thiocyanate, halogen, or nitrile groups. Certain other coumarin compounds in which R5 is appended to the coumarin ring by other than an electronegative i.e., an electron withdrawing group are known to fluoresce intensely but are not as useful in the practice of this invention, as this fluorescence prevents the transfer of energy of excitation to the europium or terbium complex with subsequent fluorescence in the visible portion of the spectrum. The organic salt or acid used to form the rare earth chelate must absorb in the region of 300 500 nm and must then transfer its excitation energy to the lanthanide metal, which then fluoresces in the visible portion of the spectrum. Other examples of useful complexing compounds include EMI10.1 EMI11.1 The complex contains any ratio of lanthanide metal to chelating agent.In preferred embodiments, the mole ratio of lanthanide metal to chelating agent is from 1 1 to 2 1, most preferably, 1 1. The chelating agents are prepared by performing a Mannich reaction between known compounds of the structureEMI11.2 and iminodiacetic acid or esters thereof, and formaldehyde or by a nucleophilic displacement reaction between compounds of the structureEMI11.3 that have active methylene groups, such as bromomethyl or methylenetosylate groups, and iminodiacetic esters, and in a subsequent step, hydrolyzing the esters. Useful complexes includeEMI12.1 The lanthanide metal and the chelating agent are easily complexed by merely mixing an aqueous solution of the chelating agent with a lanthanide metal salt in an aqueous solution of pH 7.5 10. The lanthanide metal salt is any water soluble salt of the metal, such as chloride salts, such asTbCl3 6H2O or EuCl126H20. The present complexes maintain electrical neutrality by virtue of the presence of another cation in the buffer solution. The chelate is generally prepared in aqueous solution at a pH of from 8 to 11, preferably, 8 to 9. The chelate optionally is mixed with buffers such as phosphate and borate, to produce the optimum pH. The chelate is useful to label a variety of physiologically active materials by binding them to the complex by adsorption or by covalent bonding.Among the physiologically active materials that are labeled in this fashion are enzymes, and their substrates, antigens, i.e., any substance that is capable, under appropriate conditions, of reacting specifically in some detectable manner with an Oantibody, carbohydrate, metabolites, drugs, other pharmacological agents and their receptors and other binding substances. Specific binding assay reagents are described in U.S. Patents 3,557,555, 3,853,987, 4,108,972 and 4,205,058. Techniques for performing such binding of physiologically active materials to the complexes are well known in the art and include simply mixing the materials together. In specific binding assay methods, a compound having structural similarity to the analyte being determined is bonded to a detectable label.The analyte being determined is herein referred to as the ligand and the labeled compound as the ligand analog. Compounds that specifically recognize the ligands and ligand analogs and bind to them are referred to as receptors. In performing one such type of assay, the ligand is placed in competition with the ligand analog for binding to the receptor. Unknown concentrations of the ligand are inferred from the measured signal of the labeled, ligand analog. The reaction proceeds as follows ligand labeled ligand analog receptor ligand receptor ligand analog receptor For illustrative purposes, the discussion that follows describes one particular type of specific binding assay technique, a competitive binding fluorescence imunoassay technique. This system consists of antigen labeled with a fluorescent label, unlabeled native antigen in test samplej and specific antibody whereby there is competition between the unlabeled antigen and the labeled antigen for binding to the antibody. The greater the concentration of unlabeled antigen from the test sample in the system, the less the labeled antigen will be bound by the antibody.If the concentration of labeled antigen and antibody is fixed and the only variable is the level of unlabeled antigen, it is possible to determine the unknown level of unlabeled antigen by physically separating the antigen antibody complex from the remaining free antigen both labeled and unlabeled and comparing the fluorescence of the labeled antigen, either free or bound, with a standard curve plotting of the values given by a range of known amounts of the antigen treated in the same manner. A preferred fluorescently labeled specific binding reagent comprises a complex of a lanthanide metal and a chelating agent having the structure EMI14.1 wherein Z, R2, R , and R are as described above and L is a linking group, such as an ester, such asEMI15.1 amide, such asEMI15.2 EMI15.3 sulfonamide, such as S02NH ,EMI15.4 ether, such as O , S carbonyl, such asEMI15.5 nitrilo, such as N and imino, such as NH including those groups comprising additional organic linking atoms, such as arylene and thioarylene p and m are 0 or 1, n is 1 to 3, and R is a physiologically active material, such as an antigen or hormone. Once prepared as described hereinabove, the fluorescent labeled, physiologically active species is useful in fluorescent specific binding assays, particularly those that utilize temporal resolution of the specific detecting signal to distinguish from background as described in German OLS 2,628,158. In this time resolved mode i.e., temporal resolution , the sample is excited in an intermittent fashion and information is accepted only during the dark cycle when the long lived fluorescent label is still emitting strongly, but when other sources of fluorescence have decayed. Discontinuous excitation is achieved in a variety of ways, including pulsed laser, mechanical chopping of a continuous excitation beam, and moving the sample in and out of the excitation beam. Moreover, discontinuous excitation has the advantage of allowing the use of high radiant power without the absorption of a large amount of energy by the sample, thus diminishing the probability of sample photodegradation. Examples of such fluorescent specific binding assay techniques wherein the specific binding reagents described herein find utility are described in U.S. Patents 3,998,943, 4,020,151, 3,939,350, 4,220,450 and 3,901,654. Especially preferred fluorescently labeled specific binding reagents include those of the following structures EMI16.1 EMI17.1 EMI18.1 In a preferred embodiment, the specific binding assay is carried out in a dry analytical element, such as is described in U.S. Patent 4,258,001. In this embodiment, the element contains a support and a spreading reagent layer comprised of polymeric beads, and, optionally, a registration layer. In some cases, the spreading layer is separate from the reagent layer. The spreading, reagent, and registration layers optionally comprise the polymeric bead structure. The polymeric beads of the reagent layer have receptors such as antibodies adsorbed to their surfaces. The chelate label is placed above, below, or in the reagent layer in a manner that prevents the specific reaction from occurring prior to sample wetting, or it is spotted onto the element concurrently with or subsequent to the sample. It is only necessary that the labeled ligand analog permeate the element upon wetting subsequently to compete with the unknown amount of ligand in the sample in the formation of the ligand receptor complex. The assay is performed by fluorimetrically determining the amount of free labeled ligand analog present or the amount of bound labeled ligand analog receptor complex. The following nonlimiting examples will nerve better to illustrate the successful practice of the instant invention.Example 1 A complex was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of TbCls6H20 in an aqueous solution containing a borate buffer, which results in a pH of 9, with a compound having the structure EMI19.1 which was prepared by the method described by G.Schwarzenbach et al, Helv. Chim. Acta, 35, 1785 1952 .
