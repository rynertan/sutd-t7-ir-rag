## Description
SMINORESORCINOL DERIVATIVES This invention is concerned to new aminoresorcinol derivatives which have an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase specifically or an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase at the same time, the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as an active ingredient. Up to now, several compounds which inhibit lipoxygenase have been known, that is to say, 5,8,1l,14 eicosatetraynoic acid i.e. E TA , 5,8,ll eicosatriynoic acid, acetone phenylhydrazone i.e. APE , phenidone i.e. l phenyl 3 pyrazolidone , NDGA nordihydroguaiaretic acid ,BW 775C 3 amino 1 p trifluoromethyl pyrazole , 3 amino 1 p chlorophenyl2 pyrazoline, benoxaprofene. These above compounds inhibit all lipoxygenases and other enzymes in the arachidonate cascade at the same time, or inhibit all lipoxygenases of 5 , 12 an 15 lipoxygenase see Gendai Iryo , 12, 1065 1980 . The compounds of the present invention are particularly superior in having selective inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase of many lipoxygenases,which react at the first stage of producing various kinds of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in a living body and further not inhibiting other enzymes in the arachidonate cascade, or in having inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase which reacts at the first step of producing prostaglandins from arachidonic acid similarly, at the same time. This invention is concerned to new anwnoresorcinol derivatives which have an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase, or an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and on cyclooxygenase at the same time, the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as an active ingredient. More particularly, there are a group of compounds called leukotrienes, which are biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by a series of reactions in a living body and 5 lipoxygenase is related to the first step of this reaction. Similarly, prostaglandins are biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by another series of reactions, and cyclooxygenase is related to the first step of such reaction.This invention is concerned to new aminoresorcinol derivatives which strongly inhib r lipoxygenase or strcngly inhibit 5 lipoxygenase and cyclo oxygenase at the same time, and which are, therefore, useful as treating and preventing agentsfor diseases which induced by leukorrienes, e.g.allergic tracheal and bronchial diseases or allergic lung diseases, allergic shocks or various allergic inflammations, and various inflammations induced by prostaglandins, and further. this invention is concerned to the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them as an active ingredient. In the study of prostaglandins abbreviated as PG hereafter , many important discoveries have been made continuously in recent years.And so it was found a large change in the direction of the research and development of PG. in the compounds which have been newly found or newly confirmed their structure in PG family, it can be said that PG endoperoxides, i.e. PGG2 and PGH2 , thromboxane A abbreviated asTXA2 hereafter , prostacyclin i.e. PGI2 and leukotriene C, D and E abbreviated as LTC, LTD and LTE, respectively, hereafter etc. have especially strong and unique biological activities. All the compounds of PG family containing various PG previously known well in addition to the above compounds, are biosynthesized from the same mother compound, i.e. arachidonic acid in a living body and, therefore, the metabolic routes startihg from arachidonic acid is called Arachidonate cascade as a whole. The detailed explanation of each route and the pharmacological character of each metabolite are described in Igaku no Ayumi, 114, 378 1980 , ibid, 114. 462 1980 , ibid, 114, 866 1980 , ibid, 114, 929 1980 , Gendai Iryo, 12, 909 1980 , ibid, 12, 1029 1980 , ibid, 12, 1065 1980 and ibid, 12, 1105 1980 etc. The arachidonate cascade can be largely divided into two routes one is the route that cyclooxygenase acts on arachidonic acid to convert, via PGG2 and further PRE2, into various PG, e.g. prostaglandin F2a abbreviated PCF2a hereafter , prostaglandin E2 abbreviated PGE2 hereafter , PGI2, TXA2, and the other is the route that lipoxygenase acts on arachidonic acid to convert, via hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid abbreviated HPETE hereafter , into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid abbreviated as HETE hereafter or leukotrienes. As the former route is well known, it is not described in the present specification in detail. See Prostaglandin 1978 , edited byMakoto Katori, published by Kohdan sha. Concerning the latter route, it has been known that various compounds are produced according to the following Scheme A. SCHEME AEMI4.1 Besides being metabolized through a well known route, i.e.the route via PG endoperoxides, arachidonic acid is also metabolized through another route by the action of lipoxygenase. That is to say, arachidonic acid is metabolized by the action of lipoxygenase, e.g.5 lipoxygenase, 12 lipoxygenase and 15 lipoxygenase, to 5 HPETE, 12 HPETE and 15 HPETE, respectively, having following formulse EMI5.1 These HPETE are converted into 5 RETE, 12 HETE and 15 HETE, respectively, by the action of peroxidase converting a hydroperoxy group into a hydroxy group. Furthermore, LTA is also produced from 5 EPETE.LTA is converted into leukotriene B abbreviated as LTB hereafter enromatically or not enzymatically, or is converted into LTC by the action of glutathion S transferase. Further, LTC is converted intoLTD by the action of y glutamyl transpeptidase. Moreover, it was recently defined that LTD is metabolized to LTE see Biochem. Biophys. Bes. Commun., 91, 1266 1979 andProstaglandins, 19 5 , 645 1980 . It was found that LTC and LTD are identical trith SRS slow reacting substance or SRS A slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis which was well known before see Proc. Natal. Acad. Sot USA, 76, 4275 1979 , Biochem. Biophys. Bes. Commun., 91, 1266 1979 , Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 2014 1980 and Nature, 285, 104 1980 So it cat be understood that the pharmacological characters of these leukotrienes are the same as those of SRS or SRS A. Feldberg et al. reported that a substance is released when perfusing cobra venom through isolated lung or incubating cobra venom The vitellus. The substance uas named SRS and it has been found thatSRS constricts lem isolated from guinea pig slowly and continually see 3. Physiol., 94, 187 1938 3. Moreover, Kellaway et al. showed the relation between SRS A and allergic reaction from the fact that SRS A is released when an antigen is sensitized to perfusing lung isolated from guinea pig see Quant. J. Exp. Physiol., 30, 121 1940 . Brockiehurst reported that when the antigen is sensitized to a lung fragment isolated from a bronchial asthmatics whose specific antigen is defined, by an operation, histamine and SRS A are released and strongly constrict bronchial muscle. Since such constriction can not be prevented by an antihistaminic agent, he suggested that SRS A is an important bronchoconstrictor in an asthmatic paroxysm see Progr.Allergy, 6, 539 1962 1. Since then, many reports were published, for instance, SRS A prepared from human lung slice constrict a tracheal spiral of normal human see Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. IffEnmuol., 38, 217 1970 when SRS A prepared from rats is injected intravenously to guinea pig, significant increase of purlmonory resistance is observed see J. Clin.Invest., 53, 1679 1974 in addition, a subcutaneous injection ofSRS A to guinea pig, rat and monkey makes vascular permeability to enhance. lsee Advances in Immunology, 10, 105 1969 , J. Allergy Clin. LLnmnol., 621, 371 1978 , Prostaglandins, 19 5 , 779 1980 etc. . Generally, the substance released by immunological reaction is called SRS A. On the other hand, the substance released by nonimmunological reaction such as calcium ionophore is called SRS. However, the above two substances have many similarities each other and, therefore, it is considered they would probably be the same substance. Based on result of these studies, various leukotrienes LTC,LTD and LTE, and further other leukotrienes which may be confirmed their structures in future biosynthesized from arachidonic acid via LTA, are considered to be important factors relating to the appearance of allergic tracheal and bronchial disease, allergic lung disease, allergic shock and various allergic inflammations. Recently, it was proposed that PG is an important chemical mediator of inflammatory reaction. For example, it was reported that PCE enhances a vascular permeability and a pain, and has a vasodilative action, pyrogenetic action and chemotactic action see Prostaglandin 1978 , edited by Makoto Katori, published by Kohdan sha .Furthermore, it was reported that PGI2 alone does not affected vascular perseability, itv but it enhances vascular permeability of histamine see Prostaglandins, 15, 557 1978 3. Moreover, the most recent report indicated that in order to suppress such action of PG, it is more effective to inhibit not only 5 lipoxygenase but also cyclooxygenase at the same time seeBiochemical Pharmacology, 28, 1959 1979 and European Journal ofPharmacology, 66, 81 1980 1. As the result of energetic investigations in order to find new compounds inhibiting 5 lipoxygenase, or inhibiting 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase at the same time in a living body, and so being effective for prevention and treatment of not only various allergic diseases induced by leukotrienes but also inflammations induced by PGs, we have found the compounds which can be achieve2 that purpose, having completed this invention. The present invention accordingly provides new aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula EMI9.1 wherein RÚ represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a group of the general formula EMI9.2 in which R5 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a carboxy group, an amino group, a carbamoyl group, a sulfamoyl group or a cyano group and n represents zero or an integer of 1 or 2 , one of R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents a hydroxy group or an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or R2 and R3 together represent an oxo group, and R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a phenylthio group, and the amino group and the group R4 in the general formula I can be attached to the position 2 and 4, or 4 and 2 of the resorcinol ring, respectively , and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, when one ofRê and R represents a hydroxy or alkoxy group, the carbon atom whichRê and R are attached to, will become center of chirality. Further centers of chirality may occur when the alkyl groups represented by RÚ,R4 or R5, or the alkyl moisty of the alkoxy groups represented by one ofRê and R3, or R5, are branched chain. The presence of chirality leads, as is well known, to the existence of isomerism. However, all isomers of general formula I and mixtures thereof are to be considered within the the scope of general formula I . In this specification, it is to be understood that the alkyl group and the alkyl moiety of the alkoxy groups may be straight or branched chain. Examples of the alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms represented by RÚ and R4, are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl and their isomers Examples of the alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms represented by R5, are methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl and their isomers. Examples of the alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms represented by one of Rê and R , and R5, are methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy and their isomers. Examples of the halogen atom represented by R4 and R5, are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atom. Examples of the group represented by the formula CH2 , , are single bond, methylene and ethylene. Preferred examples of RÚ are the pentyl and hexyl groups and the group of the general formula II in which R5 and n are hereinbefore defined. More preferred examples of R are the group of the general formula II in which R5 is a hydrogen or halogen atom, or an alkyl or alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Host preferred examples of R1 are the group of the general formula II in which R is a hydrogen, chlorine or fluorine atom. PreferablyRê and R together represents an oxo group, and further, one of Rê and R represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents a hydroxy, methoxy or ethoxy group. Preferred examples of R4 are a hydrogen and halogen atoms and a tert butyl group, and more preferred examples of R4 are a hydrogen, chlorine and fluorine atoms.Preferably the amino group in the general formula I is attached to the position 2 of the resorcinol 4 ring and the group R is attached to the position 4 of the said ring. According to the present invention, aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula I , wherein one of Rê and R represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. compounds of the general formula EMI11.1 wherein R6 represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the other symbols are as hereinbefore defined may be prepared from aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula I , wherein one of R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents a hydroxy group, i.e. compounds of the general formula EMI12.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined by etherification of the secondary alcohol to an alkoxy group. The converting method is well known, for example, by using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid etc. as a catalyst, in corresponding alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol etc. at a temperature from 0 C to the refluxing temperature of the alkanol. Aninoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula IB may be prepared from aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula I , wherein Rê and R together represents an oxo group, i.e. compounds of the general formula EMI12.2 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined by reduction to convert the oxo group to 2 hydroxy group. The reduction may be carried out, for example, in an atmosphere of hydrogen using a catalyst, e.g. palladium carbon, palladium black in an organic solvent at a temperature from O C to 40 C, or using metal chloride, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride etc., aluminium isopropylalcoholate, an alkaline metal or an alkaline metal amalgan as a catalyst in an alkanol as a hydrogen done and as a solvent. Aminoresorcinol derivatives of tbe general formula IC may be prepared from compounds of the general formula EMI13.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined and the nitro 4 group and the group R can be attached to the position 2 and 4, or 4 and 2 of the resorcinol ring, respectively by selective reduction to convert the nitro group to a primary amine. The reduction can be carried out, for example, by using hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel, platinum or palladiumcarbon, by using iron, zinc, tin or stannous chloride in addition to hydrochloric acid, by using titanium trichloride in the presence of benzene or a mixture of benzene and tetrahydrofuran, by using sodium sulfide or ammonium sulfide in water or an aqueous alcohol, or by using sodium hydrosulfite in ammonia water etc. The compounds of the general formula III may be prepared from compounds of the general formula EMI13.2 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined and the group can be attached to the position 2 or 4 of the resorcinol ring by nitration. The nitration is carried out by using a conventional nitrating reagent, for example, a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid in acetic acid, or nitric acid in acetic acid. EEnen the group R4 is a hydrogen atom, the product of the general formula III is a mixture of isomers in which the nitro group is attached to the position 2 or 4 of the resorcinol ring. Each isomer may be separated by a conventional method of separation, e.g. by distillation under reduced pressure or by high speed liquid, column or thin layer chromatography on silica gel, or by recrystallization. The compounds of the general formula IV are well known per se e.g. 6 benzoylresorcinol is a compound on the market or may be prepared by methods known per se, for example, by the series of reactions depicted schematically below in Scheme B, wherein the various symbols are 4 as hereinbefore defined and the group R can be attached to the position 2 or 4 of the resorcinol ring. Scheme BEMI15.1 In Scheme X, each step can be effected using methods known per se. For example, step e may be carried out by etherification, by heating with methyl iodide in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetone. Step b may be carried out by acylation of Friedel Crafts reaction, for example, by reacting with an acylating agent such as acyl halides of the general formula RÚCOX in which X is a halogen atom andR is as hereinbefore defined in an inert organic solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium chloride at a temperature from 200C to 500C. Step c may be carried out by using hydrobromic acid or a fixture of hydrobromic acid and hydroiocic acid in acetic acid or wIthout solvent, with reflexing. Step d may be carried out by reacting with an acyl halide 0 the general formula RÚCOX in which the various symbols are as here before defined . Step e may be carried out by Fries rearrangement, for example, in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride or without solvent, in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium chloride. Acid addition salts of aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula I may be prepared from the compounds of the general formula I by methods know, per se, for example, by reacting stoichiometric quantities of a compound of the general formula I and an appropriate acid, e.g. an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, bydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, lactic acid, tartric acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, methanesuiphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid or isethionic acid, in 2 suitable solvent. Preferably, acid addition salts are non toxic salts. By the term non toxic as used in this specification, is meant salts the anions of which are relatively innocuous to animal organism when used in therapeutic doses so that the benefitical pharmacological properties of the compounds of general formula I are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to those anions. Preferably the salts are water soluble.Suitable acid addition salts are, for example, inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, phosphorate, nitrate, or organic acid salts such as acetate, lactate, tartrate, benzoate, citrate, methanesulfphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, toluenesulphonate or isethionate. Aminoresorcinol derivatives of the general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts possess an inhibitory effect on 5 lipoxygenase specifically, or 5 lipoxygenase anc cyclooxygenase at the same time, and therefore, effective when it is desired to control the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and various PGs in mammals including human, especially human. For example, in standard assay system using polymorphonuclear leukocytes from guinea pig details of experiments were described hereafter , the concentrations of 2 amino 6 benzoylresorcinol hydrochloride for 50 inhibitions on 5 lipoxygenase and on cycloxygenase were 0.3 M and 0.8 UM, respectively. Therefore, it is confirmed that this compound inhibits both enzymes at the same time at a very low concentration. The experiments for screening using polymorphonuclear leukocytes were carried out as follows The reaction mixture 0.1 ml containing 5 mole of potassium phosphate at pE 7.4, 0.1 mole of calcium chloride, polymorphonuclear leukocytes prepared from guinea pigs 4 x 1C ceLls and test compound, was preincubated for 5 rinutes at 37 C.The reaction was started by the addition of 14C arachidonic acid 2.2 x 105 dpn, 1.8 nmole , followed by the incubation at 370C for 5 minutes.The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of a rixture of ether methanol IM citric acid 30 4 1 . The organic phase 20 p1 was applied to silica gel plate. Thin layer chromatography was performed to separate each product with solvent system of ether petroleum ether acetic acid 85 15 0.1 . Activity of 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase were calculated frot the measurements of the production of 5 BETE, and 12L hydroxy 5,8,10 heptatrienoic acid i.e. HHT or thromboxane Ez i.e. TIBz , respectively it has been kno that HHT and TXBz are the last products of the system concerning cyclooxygenase in the arachidonate cascade .The concentrations for 50 inhibitions on 5 lipoxygenase and on cyclooxygenase were evaluate2 by using the concentration of compounds of the present invention required 50h inhibitions on the productions of 5 HETE, and HRT or TXBz, respectively. Further, in another assay system, the inhibitory activity of compounds of the present invention on 5 lipoxygenase only was also evaluated by using an enzyme prepared from polxmorphonuclear leukocytes of guinea pig. Guinea pig was treated by casein and harvested polymorphonuclear leukocytes from cavity were sonicated, followed by the centrifugation at 105,000 x g. The supernate was used as an enzyme throughout this work. The supernate 100 500 g of protein was incubate for 5 minutes at 300C with 14C arachidonic acid and 1 mM calcium chloride in the presence or in the absence of test compound.The reaction was terminated by the addition of ether. Ether extract was separated by thin layer chromatography using silica gel plates to observe production of gHETE, 5,12 diHETE and LTB. In this assay, the concentrations of 2 amino 6 benzoylresorcinol hydrochloride, 4 amino 6 benzoylresorcinol hydrochloride, 2 amino 4chloro 6 4 chlorobenzoyl resorcinol hydrochloride and 2 amino ta chloro 6 alpha methoxy 4 chlorobenzyl resorcinol hydrochloride required to produce 2 50r inhibition on the productions of SHETE, 5,12 diHETE and LTB concentration for a 50 inhibition of Slipoxygenase, i.e. IC50 were 0.4 uM, 6.67 M, 2.63 M and 2.0 uM, respectively. On the other hand, all extent of the compounds of the present invention were confirmed that their acute toxicities were more than 30 mg kg by intravenous administration. Therefore, aminoresorcinol derivatives of the present invention may be considered to be sufficiently safe and suitable for medical use. For Example, no mouse was dead when 2 amino 6 benzoylresorcinol hydrochloride was intravenously administered to tail vein in seven mice at the dose of 30 mg kg. To control the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins are useful for the prevention and the treatment of allergic tracheal and bronchial diseases or allergic lung diseases, allergic shocks or various allergic inflammations, in addition to various inflammations induced by prostaglandins in mammals including human , especially human.
