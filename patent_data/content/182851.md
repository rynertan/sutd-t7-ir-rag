## Description
The present invention relates to different components of primycin obtained by the separation of primycin mixture and to the process for the separation of these components from the antibiotic complex. A further object of the invention is a synergistic pharmaceutical composition comprising the said components and process for the preparation thereof. The primycin antibiotic complex can be obtained from the culture of strain Thermopolyspora galeriensis belonging to the species of Streptomycetae its preparation by fermentation is described by Hungarian patent specification No. 153,593. Primycin is an antibiotic of macrolide type which is characterized in the prior art J. Chem. Soc., Perkin I. page 816, 1974 by one single formula 5 18 α D arabinofuranosyloxy 2 butyl 3,7,11,15,19,21,23,25,27 nonahydroxy 4,16,32,34 tetramethyl 1 oxo oxacyclohexatriaconta 16,32 diene 35 yl 4 hydroxyhexyl guanidinum sulphate. Primycin is a very effective antibiotic which can be widely used, it is effective first of all against gram positive bacterias but also against the polyresistant human pathogenic strains. Resistancy has not been developed against it yet. Our former experiments have already referred to the fact that the primycin obtained by fermentation is not a homogeneous substance. The recent developments of chromatography enabled us to submit the primycin substance mixture to a more detailed searching examination. It was discovered that the primycin obtained by fermentation comprises three major and six minor components along with some other impurities and that the process of our invention is suitable for the qualitative and preparative separation of these components. Surprisingly we also found that components enhance each others effect, i.e. they show synergistic activity. We targeted our efforts for separating and isolating the different components of the antibiotic complex produced by strain Thermopolyspora galeriensis. Several chromatographic methods were tested and it was found that thin layer and column chromatography are the most effective ones for the above purpose. In the field of the thin layer chromatography TLC the use of commercial chromatographic plates, with silica gel adsorbent layer thereafter the high performance thin layer chromatographic plates with suitable solvent system resulted in the separation of the components with surprisingly high resolution. According to a preferred embodiment of the separation process of our invention the stock solution of the fat free, crude, semi half or pure product derived from the mycelium of strain Thermopolyspora galeriensis is applied onto a TLC chromatographic plate, developed, the spots thus obtained are detected and the major and or minor components of the antibiotic complex are separated. For the preparation of the stock solution of the crude, semi half or pure product recovered frog the culture medium aqueous solutions of alcohols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture thereof, preferably a 25 25 50 by volume mixture of ethanol In our experiments first time we used a commercial silica gel chromatographic plate typ Kieselgel 60 F₂₅₄ size 20 x 20 cm, thickness of the silica gel layer 0.2 mm . Several solvent mixtures were tested on this plate in order to achieve the best separation of the primycin mixture. The best separation can be attained when the eluent used comprises halogenated hydrocarbon s , organic acid s , alcohol s , water, and preferably aldehyde s . The following solvents can be used as eluent halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane , organic acids, preferably aliphatic carboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. formic acid, acetic acid , halogenated aliphatic carboxylic acids e.g. monochloro , dichloro and trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid , aromatic carboxylic acids e.g. benzoic acid , organic sulphonic acids e.g. methanesulphonic acid, tolunenesulphonic acid , alcohols, preferably aliphatic straight or branched alcohols of 1 to 10 carbon atoms e.g. methanol, ethanol, For the separation of the components of the primycin antibiotic complex the following solvent systems proved to be the most effective The solvent mixture I and II are of higher capacity, while solvent mixtures III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII are more selective and preferably the developing time is shorter which is preferable from the point of view of industrial serial tests. Solvent systems IV, V and VI are chemically metastable due to the formation of methylformiate, while solvent III is physically metastable. According to its isothermic curves system IV can be used up within 16 to 24 hours calculated from its preparation, systems V, VI, VII and VIII can be used at once after adding the components to each other, while system III can be preserved for 1 week if 1 to 2 methanol is added. Solvent systems IV, V, VI, VII and VIII are preferred. In eluent IV the suitable separation can be achieved if the development is carried out twice as the R The components or the primycin substance mixture separated by thin layer chromatography can be detected by chemical methods and or bioautography. For chemical detection sulfuric acidic vanilline, chlorotoluidine, phospho, molybdic acid, benzidine, modified Sakaguchi reagent and or ethanolic sulfuric acid known from the prior art and or heat treatment are the most effective, giving a specific characteristic and sensitive colour reaction. The spots can be located preferably by immersing the development chromatoplates into suitable reagents and after drying the chromatograms can be evaluated by Shimadzu densitometer in some cases. The bioautographic development is carried out as follows In order to illustrate the above procedure the figure of the thin layer chromatographic plate obtained after double development with solvent system IV is shown by Figure 1. The different spots obtained after development. of the primycin samples obtained from different culture mediums spots 1 to 4 well support that primycin is a mixture. The isolated major components A₁, B₁ and C₁ and the bioautogram of the complex can be also seen on the figure. Developing the primycin mixture once with solvent system V the mixture separates into the following components characterized by the R The efficiency of the separation can be enhanced by using HPTLC plate. Then solvent system VI is used as eluent in order to provide appropriate separation. Similarly excellent separation can be obtained when Kieselgel 60 F₂₅₄ chromatographic plate impregnated with a suitable metal salt, preferably silver salt is used instead of the hardly available and expensive HPTLC plate. In the course of the impregnation the chromatographic plate is plunged into the aqueous and or organic solvent e.g. acetonitrilic solution of the metal salt, preferably 20 aqueous solution is used. Preferably silver salts, e.g. silver nitrate, iron salts, e.g. iron II phosphate can be used as metal salts. The surface humidity of the impregnated layer is dried off thereafter the plate is activated at 120 It was found that primycin is a mixture of three major components A₁, B₁, C₁ and more minor components. The individual components crystallize together depending on the solubility conditions. The percental composition of the antibiotic complex can be influenced by changing the conditions of the fermentation nutrient medium, cultivating time and temperature, degree of aerating etc. . The advantages of the thin layer chromatography elution was improved by working out the preparative separation of the primycin mixture with column chromatographic method. The partition and adsorption column chromatography was tested. According to our invention the partition column chromatographic separation is carried out by using a solid carrier Sephadex LH 20 and a counter current Droplet Counter Current Chromatography, further is referred as DCCC . The same solvent systems can be used for this method as for the thin layer chromatography, i.e. two layer solvent systems containing organic acids, and or chlorinated hydrocarbons and or alkanols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and or water. Solvent system I is preferred stationary phase wherein the solid carrier Sephadex LH 20 is swollen for two days, thereafter it is filled into the chromatographic column and washed with the lower phase of a 30 10 60 mixture of The fractions of the sane composition are combined and exposed to vacuum distillation and the yields are determined. A 90 to 95 of the product applied to the column is recovered. The eluate containing mainly the major components A₁, B₁ and C₁ is further purified by chromatography. Component A₁ was chromatographed with solvent system I, component B₁ was obtained with a solvent containing benzene, It was found that the components of the primycin mixture can be most preferably separated by column chromatography optionally under gentle pressure using the suitable silica gel packing. The following columns were tested silica gel column filled by ourself the ready to use Lobar type column Merck , a column filled with silica gel impregnated with a suitable metal salt preferably with silver and or iron salt similarly to the thin layer chromatographic plate . The efficiency of the separation is highly enhanced if the Lobar type column is used or in lack of this column, the column filled with impregnated silica gel instead of a column filled with simple silica gel. A slight overpressure 1.1 to 5.0 atm can be useful in the case of the Lobar type column as well as the column filled with impregnated gel. In the course of impregnation the silica gel is mixed with a suitable metal salt, preferably it is suspended in the solution of the metal salt prepared with an organic solvent, thereafter the solvent is optionally removed and the impregnated silica gel can be used as the packing of the column. The column is filled with impregnated silica gel suspended in an organic solvent, preferably halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbone e.g. chloroform and compacted by slight overpressure 1.1 to 2.5 atm . If a silver salt is used as metal salt it is desirable to protect the column from light in order to prevent the reduction of the silver salt. The primycin mixture to be separated or the separated components thereof is applied onto the top of the column, dissolved in the solvent mixture used as eluent and adsorbed by slight overpressure. The substance mixture to be separated can be industrial primycin sulphate or an other primycin salt preferably primycin acetate or primycin monochloroacetate prepared from primycin sulphate according to the Hungarian patent specification No. 257 84. Solvent systems V, VI, VII and VIII can be used as solvents. The best separation then can be achieved if solvent mixture V, VI or VIII is used for eluting the Lobar coloumn, while solvent mixture VII is the most preferable for eluting the column filled with silica gel impregnated with metal salt. Fractions of the same volume are collected by a constant flow rate and the composition thereof is controlled by thin layer chromatography. The fractions containing the substance of the same R As a result of the separation by column chromatography using solvent system V as eluent the following components were isolated The usual physical constants melting point, elementary analysis data, optical activity, UV and IR specra, etc. are not characteristic for the individual compounds. E.g. the melting point of the single components is 160 to 170 The primycin components were isolated in the form of the sulfate or other salts different from the sulfate, preferably the acetate or monochloroacetate depending on the starting primycin mixture. The sulfate salts of the isolated primycin components can be transformed into other salts by the aid of different organic or inorganic acids as it is described in the Hungarian patent application No. 2571 84. The spectra of the antimicrobial activity of the primycin mixture and the three major components A₁, B₁ and C₁ is shown by Table 0 see later on page 24. . The table contains the MIC values Surprisingly we found that the components strengthen each other s effect, i.e. they show potentized synergism. On the basis of the synergistic effect and the supposed different attacking point of the major components the following advantageous effects can be achieved by using the composition of the components In the synergistic composition according to our invention the major components A₁, B₁, C₁ and other, minor components of primycin and derivatives thereof preferably salts can be used. A composition can comprise two or three or more different components. If two major components are used in the composition the weight ratio of the components is in the range of 5 95 to 95 5 , while if the three major components A₁, C₁ and B₁ are used, then the weight ratio of the components is in the range of 40 30 30 to 70 10 20. The preferred embodiments of the synergistic compositions according to the invention are illustrated by the following examples, wherein the MIC values measured by using different microorganism strains and the degree of the additive and synergistic effect are also indicated. Under the term additive effect there is to understand that the effect of the components is summarized, thus e.g. by adding the half of the MIC value of the one component to the half of the MIC value of the second component, the MIC value of the combination of the two active ingredients is obtained. When the antimicrobial activity exceeds the additive effect due to the favourable interaction of the components, potentized synergism appears and the effect thus obtained is the synergistic effect. The MIC values were determined in Difco Bouillon culture medium. The evaluation was carried out after incubating at a temperature of 37 The primycin components according to the invention can be administered alone or mixed with each other, optionally together with other pharmaceutical active ingredients. They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The active ingredient can be administered in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, dragees, suppositories, semi solid forms such as ointments or gels or liquid dosage forms such as injectable solutions, suspensions or syrups. The preferred dosage forms are the gels, ointments, surgical dusting powders, injections, suspensions and combinations of powder ampoulles solvent ampoules. The compositions according to our invention can be administered orally, parenterally, rectally or topically e.g. ointments . They contain usual pharmaceutical carriers e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, starch, talc, water, etc. or novel carriers, e.g. cyclodextrine and optionally excipients, disintegrating agents, emulsifiers etc. The dosage forms suitable for oral administration may be e.g. tablets, dragees or capsules. The synergistic compositions containing more active ingredient according to the invention can be also used in veterinary therapeutics e.g. in the form of a liquid mixed to the feedstuff. The dosage froms suitable for parenteral administration can be aqueous emulsions, solutions or suspensions. Dusting powders, ointments, aqueous or oily emulsions or bandages impregnated with these emulsions or suspensions or sprays can be used for topical administration. The invention is illustrated by the following, non limiting examples. 0.5 solution of primycin complex is prepared with a 1 1 2 mixture of The composition of the culture medium used in the course of the bioautographic assay is as follows The culture medium is incubated at 121 The procedure of Example 1 is followed except that solvent mixture V is used as eluent therefore the development is carried out once. 4 µl 20 The procedure of Example 1 is followed except that solvent mixture VII is used for the development and the Kieselgel 60 F₂₅₄ plate is impregnated with a metal salt according to the method described hereinabove before use. The further steps are the same as described in Example 1. 2 ml of the 1 solution of the sample to be examined is applied onto a PSC Fertigplatten, Kieselgel 60 F₂₅₄ Merck plate. The plates are developed by solvent system IV more times. If a 3 3 cm wide stripe on the left and the right side of the glass plates is plunged into pre heated Sakaguchi reagent, the spots appeared as vivid red spots at room temperature. The distinct fractions are scraped off and eluted in a micropercolator with 10 acetic acidic methanol until no reaction can be observed upon adding sulphuric acidic vanilline. The eluate is distilled in vacuo, the dry residue is dissolved in solvent system I and extracted with distilled water of fifth part volume four times. The components of the antibiotic are in the upper layer, while the layer dead weight is in the lower phase. The components obtained by evaporating the upper phase are further purified according to a method of Example 1. 720 g of Sephadex LH 20 gel is swollen in 3 l of solvent system I for 1 day. The suspension is filled to a chromatographic column 58 x 1150 mm , settled, thereafter washed with 1.5 l of mobile phase. 2 g of primycin are dissolved in a mixture of 300 ml of mobile phase and 15 ml of stationary phase, the solvent is filtered and applied onto the column. The elution is carried out by the aid of the mobile phase with a flow rate of 50 to 60 drops minute. Generally fractions of 17 ml volume 800 drops are collected and the elution is proceeded until 300 to 400 fractions are obtained. The fixed phased Sephadex LH 20 column can be used up for 3 to 4 times if the phase is changed. The gel can be regenerated as follows it is suspended in acetone, filtered, refluxed for 2 hours with acetone in the vapour space thereafter dried. The substances being in the different fractions are identified by thin layer chromatography and UV spectroscopy. The fractions which are found to comprise the same substance on the basis of the analysis data UV and TLC are combined. The residue obtained after evaporation of the solvent is dissolved in a 2 1 mixture of methanol and benzene and evaporated again. Thus 743 mg of a mixture of the components A and a mixed fraction of 570 mg comprising components A and C are obtained. Components B remain on the column in this system, they can be dissolved by solvent system I, 480 mg of components B can be obtained. A further chromatography of component mixture A under the above conditions results in major component A₁ in a purity higher than 98 . The components B obtained as described in Example 6 are further purified with a chromatographic method described hereinabove except that the so called B selective solvent system is used as eluent. Thus major component B₁ can be obtained with a purity higher than 96 . The composition of the B selective solvent system is as follows The mixed fractions obtained in Example 6 are further purified by DCCC. The solvent system is stirred for 2 hours, left to stand for 16 hours and the phases are separated. The DCCC instrument ID 2.0 mm, 300 tubes is filled with the lower phase stationary phase . 130 mg of the substance to be examined are dissolved in 12 ml of upper phase mobile phase , filtered and pumped to the container. The elution is carried out by the aid of the upper phase, under an overpressure of 1.7 to 1.8 atm with a flow rate of 15 ml hour and fractions of 3.7 ml volume 220 drops are collected. Thus major component C₁ is obtained in a purity of 90 . In a solution of 40 g of silver nitrate and 500 ml of acetonitrile 200 g of Kieselgel HF₂₅₄ silica gel are suspended thereafter the solvent is evaporated in vacuo. The impregnated silica gel is suspended in 500 ml of chloroform and filled into the chromatographic coloumn. In order to promote the settling and the compaction a slight overpressure 1.1 to 2.5 atm is used until the height of the packing bed settles. In order to avoid the reduction of silver nitrate due to light the column is covered with aluminium foil. 400 mg of primycin are dissolved in 12 ml of solvent system VII freshly prepared. The solution is adsorbed by the aid of slight overpressure 1.1 atm onto the packing bed. 30 ml of eluent solvent system VII are applied onto the top of the packing and the elution is started with a flow rate of 1.1 ml minute under an overpressure of 1.5 to 2.5 atm. The substances being in the fractions are identified by thin layer chromatography. 10 µl of each fractions are applied to the starting points of Kieselgel 60 F₂₅₄ Merck plates and developed for a distance of 16 cm in an unsaturated chamber with solvent system V. The spots are located by development with chlorotolidin reagent and or sulfuric acid and or heat treatment after drying with cold air. The fractions comprising the same substance are combined and the primycin component is precipitated by adding ether. The solid substance precipitated is filtered off and washed with some acetonitrile and ether. The residue is dissolved in the upper layer of a 4 1 5 mixture of Lobar C Merck column filled with LiChroprep, preferably two or more columns are joined. The procedure of Example 9 is followed except that solvent system VIII is used as eluent. 3400 mg of primycin are dissolved in 40 ml of solvent system VIII, thereafter this solution is applied onto the top of a coloumn system containing four columns connected in series. The fractions comprising the same substances are combined, The procedure of Example 10 is followed except that 5 ml of methanol and 0.3 ml of 1N sulfuric acid are added to the combined fractions. The precipitation is completed by adding 300 ml of ether. Thus the primycin components of Example 10 are obtained in the form of sulfate salt. From the sulfate salts of the components of primycin other salts different from the sulfate salt are prepared by adding barium salts according to the process of Hungarian patent application No. 2571 84. Thus the salts of the primycin components different from sulfate are obtained in the form of e.g. formiate, acetate, monochloroacetate, oxalate, benzoate, tosylate, perchlorate, chloride etc. The antimicrobial activity of the primycin complex and the components thereof is tested on different microorganism strains.

The ingredients are mixed and filled into a flash. The ingredients are mixed and filled into a bottle or jar. Sterile castor oil to 1000.0 g. A solution of the isolated components of primicin or a mixture thereof is made preferably with ethanol and bandages, e.g. mull sheet is saturated with it, thereafter the bandage is packed and sterilized in a usual way. The sterile, antimicrobial bandage thus prepared can be used up at any time.
