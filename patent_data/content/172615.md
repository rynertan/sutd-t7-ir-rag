# LIQUID CRYSTAL PANEL DISPLAY APPARATUS

## Abstract
A liquid crystal panel display apparatus has a generally rectangular tabular light guide plate 10 having a flat upper surface 11 , the underside of the light guide plate having at least one tapered surface 15,16 which extends from near one longitudinal end of the light guide plate towards the other end such as to progressively approach the flat upper surface of the light guide plate. The tapered surface is provided with fine convexities and concavities. The appar atus further has a liquid crystal cell device 50 provided on the portion of the upper surface opposing the tapered surface. Light from a light source 30,40 is introduced into the light guide plate and is spread uniformly over the entire area of the portion of the flat upper surface opposing the tapered surface of the light guide plate so as to obtain a uniform illumination over the entire area of the liquid crystal cell device. Only a thin light guide plate and a reflecting mirror need be disposed under the liquid crystal cell device. Consequently, this liquid crystal PAD can be used on a digitizer.
