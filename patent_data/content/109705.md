# Subscriber circuit for a telephone network.

## Abstract
A subscriber circuit for a telephone network which is coupled to earth via a frequency dependent coupling circuit 7 . As for direct current the coupling circuit has a much lower impedance than for alternating current, the electrolytic corrosion due to leakage current in the subscriber line is counter acted and no severe requirements need to be imposed on the equality of the impedances in the two wires of the subscriber line.
