# A STABLE INTERFERON BETA COMPOSITION AND A METHOD OF STABILIZING INTERFERON BETA

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of stabilizing Interfer on β Human Fibroblast Interferon HFIF , wherein a highly purified Interferon β solution, admixed with known exci pients therefor, is dialysed against an acetate buffer at pH 3.5 for about 48 hours. The resulting Interferon β solution is admixed with from 0.5 to 10 wt volume of polyvinyl pyrrolidone prior to or following filtration through a sterile filter, dispensed into glass vials, lyophilized, and the vials are sealed in vacuo and stored at 4 C.
