# Process for preparing a poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate product, products thereof, use of some of these products as flame retardants and materials treated therewith.

## Abstract
Phosphorus containing flame retardants are prepared by a two step process having as essential steps 1. reacting diorgano organophosphonate with reactant comprising phosphorus oxide reagent to yield a metaphosphate phosphonate reaction product, and thereafter 2. reacting the reaction product of step 1 with reactant comprising epoxide to yield poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate product. Selected novel poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate products contain a backbone structure of repeating units represented by the average formula Articles and compositions such as textiles and polyurethanes are rendered flame retardant by incorporation of poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate prepared by the process of the invention particularly products of Formula I .
