## Description
This invention relates to ceramic dielectric compositions preferably such compositions have high dielectric constants K , e.g., above 12,000 low dissipation factors DF , e.g., below 3 high insulation resistance R capacitance C product RC , e.g. above 20,000 at 25 C, above 2000 at 85 C and ultra low sintering temperatures, e.g. below 1000 C and may be sintered without external atmosphere control. The most common material for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors, hereinafter called MLC s, are BaTiO₃ , SrTiO₃ with added modifiers, such as SrZrO₃, CaZrO₃, BaZrO₃, CaTiO₃ , etc. These materials have dielectric constants up to about 11,000. However, these materials must be fired at temperatures above 1250 C. Such high firing temperatures necessitate the use of expensive noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Au or their alloys which have high melting points as the internal electrode material to avoid vaporization or other loss of electrode material during the firing process. With the ever increasing cost of the noble metals, the manufacturing cost of high capacitance MLC s, which employ many internal electrode layers would be prohibitive. One prior art approach, to lowering the firing temperatures of common ceramic compositions, useful for firing dielectric layers in MLC s, involves the use of fluxes, such as PbO Bi₂O₃ ZnO B₂O₃ Al₂O₃ and SiO₂. With this approach firing temperatures below 1150 C, have been achieved so that less expensive electrode materials such as 70 Ag 30 Pd can be employed. However, these compositions have been found to have dielectric constants less than 6500 because the fluxes usually add a low dielectric constant phase to the ceramic dielectric system. Another prior art approach involves firing ceramic compositions in a reducing atmosphere such as CO CO₂ mixture so that less expensive base metal electrodes, such as Ni, can be used in MLC s. However, the dielectric constants of these compositions are also low, e.g., less than 6000. Also the ceramic composition and the firing conditions, such as temperature atmosphere, must be controlled rigidly to prevent both the reduction of the ceramic oxides or the oxidation of the electrode metals. In yet another prior art approach, ceramic compositions such as those discussed above are first fired without electrodes in a highly reducing atmosphere, such as a N₂ H₂ mixture, to promote semiconduction and large grain growth, e.g. to above 20 um, in the ceramic. The large semiconducting grains are then insulated by diffusion insulating oxides such as PbO Bi₂O₃ B₂O₃ in a second air firing process. These compositions normally have very high dielectric constants, above 20,000. However, these compositions are mainly designed for manufacturing of ceramic disc or tubular capacitors useful with low working voltages. The use of these ceramic compositions in MLC s is not practical because the large grain size requires that each dielectric layer be at least 60 um thick to sustain the required working voltages. The advantage of the high dielectric constant is lost by this thickness limitation because with the current state of the art in MLC manufacturing, much smaller and better capacitors can be manufactured to achieve the same objective with dielectric materials having lower K, for example 6,000, but with thinner dielectric thickness, for example at 20 um. In another prior art approach, lead perovskite compounds, commonly known as relaxator compounds, such as Pb Fe According to one aspect thereof, the present invention is directed to an ultra low temperature fired dielectric ceramic composition formed from two components, i.e., a major component comprising a base ceramic preparation, and a minor component comprising an oxide flux or sintering aid. More specifically, in forming the dielectric ceramic composition of the invention, the major component comprises from 95.0 to 81.5 percent by weight of the dielectric ceramic composition while the minor component comprises from 5.0 to 18.5 percent by weight of the composition. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided ultra temperature sinterable composition, comprising According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition having a sintering temperature below 1000 C, for making ceramics having a dielectric constant above 12,000 at 1KHz, 1VRMS, a dissipation factor below 3 , an insulation capacitance product above 20,000 at 25 C and above 2,000 at 85 C, the composition comprising the composition according to the first aspect of the present invention. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for making a ceramic composition having a sintering temperature below 1000 C, a dielectric constant above 12,000 at 1KHz, 1VRMS, a dissipation factor below 3 , an insulation capacitance product above about 20,000 at 25 C and above about 2000 at 85 C, the method comprising the steps of According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a multilayer capacitor produced according to the method of the present invention. Preferably the MgNb₂O₆ is formed from magnesium oxide and niobium pentoxide or their constituent oxides or oxide precursors. Preferably the major component of the ceramic composition is a base ceramic preparation of ceramic oxides and further comprises metallic silver Ag , or its constituent oxide or oxide precursor. Preferably, compositional ranges of the components of the base ceramic preparation, expressed as the oxides, are lead oxide from 65.0 to 71.6 weight percent, magnesium oxide from 4.2 to 4.9 weight percent, niobium pentoxide from 25.5 to 27.0 weight percent, lead titanate up to 4.5 weight percent, and silver from 0 to 1 weight percent. The minor component of the ceramic composition is a ceramic oxide flux or sintering aid comprising lead oxide. The weight ratio of lead oxide flux to the base ceramic preparation is from 0.05 to 0.185. The ceramic compositions of this invention when formed into multilayer capacitors have dielectric constants which are typically above 12,000 at 1KHz, 1VRMS, dissipation factors which are typically below 3 percent at 1 VRMS, and insulation resistance capacitance product which are typically greater than 40,000 at 25 C, 100 VDC mil, greater than 2000 at 85 C and greater than 200 at 125 C. The capacitors may be formed by firing at ultra low temperatures, i.e., less than about 1000 C and preferably between 900 C and 950 C. In an especially preferred embodiment, the ceramic dielectric composition is formed from a mixture of 88 weight percent of a base ceramic preparation comprising 65.56 weight percent PbO, 4.62 weight percent MgO, 25.36 weight percent Nb₂O₅ and 4.46 weight percent PbTiO₃ and 12 weight percent of an oxide flux or sintering aid which is essentially PbO. Because of their high dielectric constants and low dissipation factors and their high dielectric insulation resistance, the ceramic compositions of this invention are suitable for manufacturing MLC s, having high capacitance and small physical sizes. Because of their ultra low sintering temperatures, the ceramic compositions of this invention are suitable for manufacturing MLC s utilizing metal internal electrodes of the lower melting point metals and their alloys, such as 100 Ag. The lower melting point metals are significantly cheaper than the noble metals commonly used for such electrodes. Because the ceramic composition of this invention are sinterable in air without external atmosphere control they are suitable for manufacturing MLC s with simple kiln equipment. In addition to the above advantages, the ceramic compositions of this invention enable the manufacturing of high performance, high volume efficiency MLC s with simplified manufacturing processes and lower manufacturing costs. As hereinafter described in detail, the present invention provides a ceramic composition with a dielectric constant greater than 12,000 at 25 C and a dissipation factor less than 3 , particularly such a ceramic composition which can be sintered at temperatures below 1000 C so that it can be cofired with silver palladium alloy, with a silver content of more than 70 weight percent, for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors, and which can be sintered in an open air atmosphere without establishing a saturated lead atmosphere which further reduces the cost of manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors . Various preferred features and embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of non limiting example. As set forth below, the dielectric ceramic composition of the present invention has several advantages which result in substantial cost savings without sacrificing desirable physical and electrical properties. The present invention provides a novel dielectric ceramic composition having a dielectric constant higher than 12,000 which can be prepared by firing the component oxides or precursors thereof at a temperature not exceeding 1000 C. This composition differs substantially from those disclosed in the prior art in which desirable dielectric properties, such as a higher dielectric constant, are sacrificed in order to obtain materials which can be prepared at such lower temperatures. Since the prior art materials had dielectric constants which were too low to be of practical use in multilayer capacitors, it has previously been necessary to use materials which were fired at temperatures above 1100 C. At such high temperatures, the use of electrodes containing a high percentage of noble metals such as palladium or platinum is necessary. The lower firing temperature of the ceramic composition of the invention permits the use of lower melting metals such as silver palladium electrodes which have more than 70 percent silver and less than 30 percent palladium content as the conducting layers in multilayer capacitors. This is very advantageous because palladium, a precious metal, is considerably more expensive than silver. Thus, the use of the ceramic composition of this invention in multilayer capacitors with lower cost electrode metals results in considerable cost savings. The present invention also provides a novel dielectric ceramic composition with dielectric constant higher than 12,000 which can be prepared by firing the component oxides or precursors thereof at a temperature not exceeding 1000 C in open air atmosphere. This composition differs substantially from those disclosed in the prior art in which desirable dielectric properties such as a higher dielectric constant can only be achieved by combining several complexed ceramic precursor compositions and sintering in a closely controlled atmosphere. Such practices significantly increase the manufacturing cost of the multilayer ceramic capacitors. A fired ceramic body of the present invention is produced by reacting during the course of firing the constituent dielectric oxides of the base ceramic preparation, including lead oxide, magnesium oxide, lead titanate, and niobium pentoxide with or without a small amount of metallic silver and an oxide flux which comprises lead oxide. In preparing the base ceramic preparation used in this invention, magnesium oxide and niobium pentoxide in the proportions set forth above may be slurried together in water. After drying, the mixture may be pulverized and calcined to form magnesium niobate. The magnesium niobate, lead titanate and lead oxide in the proportions set forth above may again be slurried together in water. After drying the mixture may be pulverized and calcined again to form the base ceramic composition Pb Mg The ultra low temperature fired dielectric composition of this invention has an insulation resistance capacitance product RC greater than 40,000 ohm farads at 25 C and 100 VDC mil, and greater than 2000 ohm farads at 85 C and 100 VDC mil, and greater than 100 ohm farads at 125 C and 100 VDC mil. The dielectric constant is typically about 14,000 2000 at 1 kHz and 1 volt rms, and the dissipation factor is typically less than 3.0 percent at 1 KHz and 1 volt rms. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples, but the invention is not intended to be limited thereto. In particular, Examples 21 and 22 illustrate compositions in accordance with the present invention and the other examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention. The values given for the examples herein are subject to variations based on factors known in the art. For example, with respect to Examples 1 26 herein, the dielectric constant may be significantly increased and the dissipation factor may be significantly decreased by pulverizing, milling, uniformly dispersing, or otherwise reducing the starting materials to very fine particles. Such practices, which are commonly carried out in the course of manufacturing ceramic capacitors, were not employed to their full extent in the preparation of Examples 1 26. In addition, variations in firing conditions, sample thickness and preparation, and measurement error may result in differences in the observed values for the same composition. Thus, depending upon manufacturing techniques, and with little regard to particle size, the properties of ceramic composition made using the proportions given in Examples 1 26, can vary from values given for example the dielectric constants may vary by 1000, the dissipation factor may vary by 0.2 percent, and the capacitance change with temperature versus capacitance at 25 C may vary by 1.5 percent. Details of preferred embodiments of the present invention are further described in the following non limiting examples. MgO and Nb₂O₅ with amount as shown in Table I were weighed and mixed with about 30cc of distilled water. The mixture was mixed thoroughly in a high speed Spex model 800 2 paint mixer manufactured by Spex Industries Inc., New Jersey for 10 minutes. The wet slurries were dried into a cake and ground and screened through a 30 mesh metal screen. The powder mixtures were then calcined from 950 C to 1050 C for 3 to 5 hours. The crystal structure of the calcined powder was analyzed by x ray diffraction techniques. The results as shown in Table I indicated complete reaction and formation of MgNb₂O₆ with no excess Nb₂O₅ or MgO except for examples 4 5, which showed several unidentified phases. Examples, such as 1 and 5, which are outside the scope of this invention will be labeled with hereafter. It is commonly known that MgO readily absorbs water or moisture to form Mg OH ₂. Therefore, the nominal weight ratio of MgO and Nb₂O₅ where complete reactions and single phase MgNb₂O₆ are formed depends, to a large extent, on the actual water ignition loss of the MgO raw materials used. In actual manufacturing, MgO could be either hydrated to form Mg OH ₂ or heat treated to vaporize water moisture prior to reacting with Nb₂O₅. In another approach, MgCO₃ is used as raw material. 15g of Mg About 614 grams of Mg where The dielectric properties of Examples 6 14 as summarized in Table III demonstrate that, when PbO is uniformly mixed with the Pb Mg When the PbO to Pb Mg The dielectric properties of the ceramic disc compositions shown in Examples 8 to 13 demonstrate that they are suitable to be used as ceramic dielectric materials in manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors MLC with high volume density due to their high dielectric constant and low dissipation factor. These ceramic compositions may be used with lower cost electrode materials having high silver content, e.g., 80 Ag 20 Pd to 100 Ag due to their ability to be sintered at temperatures below 1000 C. Another advantage of these compositions include sintering in open air with a simple kiln arrangement. According to Table IV, MgNb₂O₆ and PbO were mixed, calcined, and milled to less than 1.2 µm average particle size, with the same technique as described in Examples 6 to 14, to prepare about 600 grams of Pb Mg This slurry was milled for 16 hours, discharged and filtered through a 44 micron screen. This slurry having a viscosity of about 1500 to 3000 centipoise was then de aired and cast, in accordance with standard techniques, into a tape with a thickness of 1.5 mils. The tape was converted into multilayer ceramic capacitors having either 70 percent silver 30 percent palladium or 100 percent silver electrodes via conventional processes well known in the industry. The capacitors were preheated to 260 C for 48 hours, placed on stabilized zirconia setters and sintered at 900 C to 960 C for 3 hours. The sintered capacitors had 10 active dielectric layers with dielectric thickness ranging from 0.85 to 1.10 mil. Termination electrodes or DuPont silver paint No. 4822, which is a mixture of silver and glass frit in a binder, were applied at opposite ends of the multilayer capacitor to connect alternate electrode layers and these capacitors were fired at 815 C in a tunnel furnace, the dielectric constant K , dissipation factor DF , insulation resistance R and capacitance C product RC at 25 C, 85 C, and 125 C, and capacitance change with temperature TC were measured with the same instruments described in Examples 6 14. The results are shown in Table V. The measurements were again performed from 55 C to 125 C in 10 C increments. The data in Tables IV and V demonstrate that the compositions of Examples 15 to 20 had dielectric constants exceeding 12,000 and also low dissipation factors DF and high RC products. These compositions can be fired in an open air atmosphere at temperatures as low as 920 C permitting pure silver to be used for MLC electrodes. About 600 grams of base ceramic composition were prepared as follows MgNb₂O₆, PbO, PbTiO₃ and metallic silver were mixed, calcined, and milled to less than 1.2 um average particle size, with the same technique as described in Examples 6 to 14. 520 grams of the base ceramic were then homogenously mixed with 62.4 grams of PbO, i.e., about 12 weight percent in a water slurry, dried, and screened through a 40 mesh nylon screen. 500 grams of the above ceramic preparation were then used to fabricate MLC units with either 70 Ag 30 Pd or 100 Ag internal electrodes, using the same procedure as described in Examples 15 to 20. The compositions and dielectric properties of the prepared MLC units are summarized in Tables VI and VII. Examples 21 to 23 show that when PbTiO₃ is calcined into the ceramic base composition of Pb Mg It will also be seen from Examples 24 to 26 that when metallic silver is calcined into the ceramic base composition of Pb Mg Data from the composition and physical properties of Examples 15 20 are summarized in Tables VI and VII below.
