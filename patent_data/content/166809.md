# PLURICAVITIES MICROWAVE FILTERS

## Abstract
The filter according to the present invention has mini mum dimensions, because the centers of cavities are foreseen in the apexes of a broken line, whose sides form among themselves angles greater than 90 . The filter body is preferably realized by pressure die casting of an aluminium alloy having an high flowability in the dies the dilatation coefficient of the cavities is compen sated using, in the resonators and syntony screws, some materials different from the one of the filter body. The electric losses are minimized by differential ratios among the diameters of cavities Dc and of the relevant resonators. The weight is optimized by lightenings got by cavities realized in the body.
