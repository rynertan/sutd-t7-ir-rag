# Composite floor structures.

## Abstract
A composite floor structure comprising a floor slab A1 of concrete or other compression resistant material 11 and at least one reinforced beam B1 under the floor slab A1 . The beam B1 comprises permanent shuttering including an open mouthed, upwardly facing channel formation 1a of steel or other tension resistant material and a plurality of transverse members 5a spaced apart along the length of the channel formation 1a and extending transversely to the channel formation 1a across substantially the entire width of the mouth of the channel formation 1a . Each transverse member 5a is fast with the channel formation 1a in the region of its mouth in zones 7a on opposite sides of the mouth and at least part of at least certain of the transverse members 5a extends upwardly from the region of the mouth of the channel formation 1a into the overlying floor slab A1 . Concrete or other compression resistant material 11 is located in the channel formation 1a and is formed integrally with the compression resistant material 11 of the floor slab A1 .
