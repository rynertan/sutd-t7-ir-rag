# Amino functional silicone emulsions.

## Abstract
Disclosed are organopolysiloxane compositions com prising an aminofunctional organopolysiloxane, a surfactant, an organotitanate, zirconate or germanate, an organic acid and water. These compositions having a pH of from 2.5 to less than 7.0, are useful for treating fibers to durably provide desirable characteristics, such as crease resistance, softness, elongation recovery and water repellency.
