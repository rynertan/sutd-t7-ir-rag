## Description
BORAMIDE COATINGS FOR FRICTION MATERIAL Technical Field Thc method of this invention relates to the use of aikanolamid borates as coatings for friction materials which during use, contact rustable metals. rlorb particularly. the friction material is contacted with an aqueous solution comprising at least about 0.05 weight percent, based on the weight of the solution, alkanolanide borates and sobsequently dried to remove water, leaving a coating comprising alkanolamide borates on the triction material. background Art During use, friction materials, such as brake lining or clutch tracings, come in contact with metals, e.g., cast iron. Corrosion of such ferrous metals may cause adhesion stiction ot the triction material to the metal when they are allowed to contact one another for a period of time. Generally, such corrosion and stictinn occur before the metal and friction material have received substantial sustained wear. One longstanding approach to preventing clutch facing stiction comprises coating the friction material with sodium nitrite. However, recent and anticipated agency recommendations have created a need to replace sodium nitrite which is ecologically less than desirable.It also does not aFpear to retain its corrosion resistant properties longer than a few weeks often before the friction material is operating on the vehicle , oxidizing at ambient temperatures to the nitrate. However, we have found that coatinos comprising alkanolamide borates on friction material S arc. significantly more offective in preventiog such corrosion honding and tha they maintain these properties afterApplication and during friction material use tor a substantially greater period of time. Alkanolamide botates have been used as flame retardents in cotton batting, however more usually as corrosion inhibitors and lubricants in cutting fluids.U.S. Patent 4,022,713 to Waldstein teaches a conposition comprising a liquid carrier constituting water dtlJ an alkandlamide borate, which is the reaction product of boric acid dod a primary C1 C3 alkanolanine, usefal as a corrosion inhibitor in making cutting fluids. Disclosure of the Invention The invention is directed to a method for using altanolamide borates as a coating for friction materials which during use contact suitable metals. The coating on the friction material acts to prevent corrosion or corrosion product bailed up on the metal contacting the friction material.The method of this application comprises A contacting the friction material with an aqueous solution comprising at least about 0.05, preferably between about 0.1 and about 10.0, most preferably between about 0.2 and about 5.9 weight percent, based on the weight of the solution, of alkanolanide borates and B evaporating water from aqueous coating on the friction material so as to leave the friction material with a coating comprising alkanolamide borates. The alkanolamide borates are selected from the group of compounds having the formula EMI3.1 wnerein X and X are each selected trom any oi H, R Ofl or R O B OH 2, and wherein R, R ,and R are cach selected trom any C1 C5 aliphatic group. Preferably, X and X of said formula are selected from any of R OH or R 0 B OH 2, wherein, on the average, greater than about 50 of X and X of the formula are R 0 B OH 2. More preterably, X is H,and X is selected from any of ti OH or R O B OH 2, wherein on the average greater than 50 of X ot the formula is R 0 ss OH 2. Mest preferably,additionally R, r , and P are ethyl groups. The invention is also directed to friction materials coated according to the method disclosed above. Advantageously, the borates can be applied to the friction material at very low concentrations and provide superior prevention of such corrosion related phenomena as stiction. The alkanolamide borates ot this invention also exhibit excellent compatibility with dust suppressants commonly employed for use with friction materials. Best ode tor Carrying Out the Invention The method of this invention can be used with any friction material. In general, friction materials contain a matrix of binder, such as thermosetting resin or vulcanized rubber, a tibrous reintorcement, and friction modifiers. Commonly employed fibers include asbestos, glass and steel wool while metals, metal oxides, cashew and rubber particles are molten employed as friction modifiers. Fillers or extenders may be included to modify physical characteristics and ioduce cost. The method of the present invention is d.sected to coating any friction material which during use contacts, at least tor a time fustable metals. The corrosion of such metals may result, tor exanple, trom exposure to salt water, high humidity, etc. One such embodiment, which was mentioned above, comprises coating clutch facing materials in order to prevent stiction which may occur when the clutch Lacing rests aqainst the clutch pressure plate or engine flywheel, particularly as mentioned above, at a time betore the triction material and metal have received sustained wear.It appears that with sustained wear, surtace characteristics ot the friction material and the metal are modified so as to significantly decrease the likelihood ot stiction occurring. Another embodiment of the method of the present invention comprises providing a coating comprising alkanolamide borates on brake linings, for example, to prevent corrosion build up also known as rust 3acking on the portion of the shoe adjacent to the lining. Other applications ot the method ot this invention to prevent corrosion would be apparent to those skilled in the art. The inhibitor ester compounds employed in the method of this application, i.e., the alkanolamide berates are selected trom the group consisting ot compounds having the formula EMI4.1 wherein X and X are each selected trom any of H, R OH or R O OH 2, and wherein R, R and R are eacn selected trom any C1 C5 aliphatic group.Preterably, the alkanolamide borate is a tri or more preferably a aialkanolamide borate, l.e., wherein, X and X ot the tormula are selected froa any of R Oil orR 0 t3 OH 2. wherein, on the average, greater than 50 oL X ano X ot the formula are R 0 a OH 2, or mort preferably, wherein X is H and X oL the formula is selected trom any ot R Oll or R O 8 0H 2, and wrercin on the average, greater than about 50 of X of the formula is R 0 B OH 2.Most preferably, addltionally R, R and R are ethyl groups. Most preferably, the alkanolamide borate Is a dialkanolamide borate having the formula EMI5.1 wherein at least about 50 percent ot the dialkanolamide borate component comprises the borate ot formula 1 . It is to be noted that in the most general embodiment of the alkanolamide, R, R and P can be the same or different C1 Cg aliphatic groups. As would be apparent to.one skilled in the art, mixtures ot suitable alkanolamide borates, preferably mixtures ot di anci trialkanolamide borates, could also be used in the method ot the subject invention. The aqueous solution ot the alkanolamide borate comprises at least about 0.05, preferably between about 0.1 and about 10,0, most preferably between about 0.2 and about b.0 weight percent borate. in embodiments ot the subject invention wherein, tor example, clutch pacings are coated to prevent stiction, it is generally preferable to employ aqueous solutions comprising between about 0.1 and about 5.0, more preferably between about U.2 and about 2.u weright percent botate, based on the weight ot the solution. It has beer, found that Lnr such applications, concentrations that give a reactive corate concentretion of about 1 10 gms mê are particularly uselui.However, in coatin brake friction materials so as. to prevent corrosion build up on the attached metal to eliminate rust jacking , it is preferable to employ an aqueous solution comprising between about S. u and lo.U weiqht percent alkanolamide borate, based on the weight ot the aqueous solution. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, optimal concentration of tf boramide solution to be employed would depend, in part, on the particular intended use of the coating, as well as application techniques, etc.Selection ot optimal solution coating concentration would be within the skill of those in the art. Representative of the various alkanolamide borates falling within the above formula are, or example, those commercially available trom Keil Chemical Division, ferro Corp., hammond, indians under the trademane Synkad 2UZ or trom Mazer Chemical Industries tGurnee Illinois , as a concentrate of the borJte in water generally comprising about 20 95 weight percent borate. The concentrate may be suitably diluted for use in the method of the invention of this application. The aqueous solution containing the alkanolamide borates ot this method may also .clude other materials conventionally employed in such coating. These may include wetting agents, e.g., non ionics or organic phosphate esters. dyes, and antioxidants, e.g., amines, which additives are generally employed at up to about 1 weight percent, based on solution weight. Other materials such as bust suppressants, e.g., acrylates, sodium silicates or polyvinyl alcohol PVA may be included, generally in amounts up to about IS weight percent, based on solution weight.While the dust suppressant may be included in the aqueous borato solution, thi dast s ressant Tay also be employed as a separate coating composition to be employed before. however pereferably after, coating ot the traction material with the aqueous solution comprising the alkanolamine borate.It has also been tound preferable, when employing separate coatings two step of a dust suppressant solution and a borate solution, to subject the friction material to the dust suppressant coating solution for a shorter period of time than that ot the borate solution coating during respective coating applications thereof. The aqueous solution comprising the alkanolamide borate may be applied as. a coating to the friction material by any known method such as spraying, flow coating, roll coating or immersion or like techniques.Selection ot optimal coating technique would he well within the skill of those in the art, and depends, for example, on triction material size. porosity crocessln 3 parameters, etc. The coating may be applied so as to be adsorbed on and absorbed into the. friction material in any desired amount. Penetration absortion of the coating into the friction material to between about D.5 1.0 mm of depth for clutch facings, for example, has been found suitable to prevent stiction. Coatings applied, on the other hand, to prevent rust jacking are generally suitably applied to lower penetration depths. Penetration into the friction material would depend, in part, on the physical properties ot the friction materials, including its porosity, a condition of manufacture e.g., molding conditions . After coating the traction material according to the method of this invention, water is allowed to evaporate from the aqueous coating on the friction material so as to leave a coating of alkanolamide borate on the friction material. This tray be dor. drying the trii tion material at ambient temFeratures or at elevated tamperatures, or by a combination of both aajicnt and elevated temperature drying operations. while it is preferable to allow evaporation of essentially all oL the water present in the aqueous coating on the friction material, it is not necessary to do so.The optimal amount oL water to be evaporated would depend on intended application, processing conditions, etc., oE the coated friction material and thus selection or this optimal amount of water to be removed would be within the skill or those in the art. These alkanolamide borates may we prepared by reacting a mixture ot ortho boric acre H3BO3 and alkanolamine under conditions so as to esterify at least some ol hydroxyl groups present on the alkanol moiety with the boric acid. the alkamolamine employed in the esteritication may be a mono , dl , trialkonolamine or suitable mixtures thereof, wherein the alkanol moiety is aC1 C5 aliphatic group which may be unsubstitutec or substituted with non interfering functionality.Preterably, the alkanolamine is a di or Tralkanolamine or suitable mixtures thereof. Typical alkanol moieties include but are not limited to, ethanol, l lsopropanol, 2 amino 2 methyl propanol and butanol, with ethanol being most preferred. Waldstein, in U.S. Patent 4,022,71t, teaches a method for making monoalkanolamide borates, by reaction of suitable monoalkanolamines and boric acid at mildly elevated temperatures, which patent is hereby incorporated by reterence tor these teachings. In the esterilication reaction, the water formed may be removed by means oL a reflux condenser or solvent extraction. Any excess of unreacted alkanolamine can be left in the reaction product the alkanolamide bo ate inasmuch es it does not interfere with the rust inhibiting action of tY borate product. Excess boric acid may be noutralized with bases, such as sodium hydroxide, to raintain desired pH. The reaction conditions described above are merely meant as exemplary of one such formulation, and are not neant to be limitin.3 to the method of this invention. The following examples are presented by my ot description of the process of the invention and set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors but are not to be construed as limiting.
