# Procedure for controlling the type of arc in an electrical furnace, and arc furnace which employs the procedure.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a procedure for controlling the type of arc in an electrical furnace F , which comprises the monitoring R of the short circuit power of the network line L during a period of inactivity of the arc, whereby the value thus monitored is processed El to determine a primary voltage V to be maintained at a transformer T2 supplying the electrodes of the furnace F , and whereby the processing E combines fixed parameters P and at least variable parameters relating to pre set conditions of the arc S . conditions of a substation tap changer VAR , and line parameters C including at least the state of connection of banks of capacitors C1 C2 . The invention also concerns an arc furnace F which employs a procedure for controlling the type of arc according to the methods described herein.
