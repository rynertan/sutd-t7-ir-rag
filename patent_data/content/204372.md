## Description
The invention relates to a method for the preparation of con centrated photographic processing baths for photographic materials containing silver halides, such as developers and fixing baths, in a form such that the chemical components are present partially as solids and partially as liquids in the concentrate such a mixture is commonly referred to as paste . It is generally known that the concentrations of the various components in a photographic processing bath must lie within rela tively narrow limits in order to obtain a product having optimal photographic properties see, for example, the book by L.F.A. Mason Photographic Processing Chemistry The Focal Press, London, 2nd edition, 1975 . The most important solvent for the processing of photosensitive material based on silver halides is water. Most in organic salts can be readily dissolved therein, while the solu bility in water of the organic chemicals usually employed in this sector of photography, such as developing agents and antifoggants, is also sufficiently great. However, a major shortcoming of ready for use solutions is that they have a high water content, as a result of which a sub stantial proportion of the handling, transport and storage costs which must be incurred in order to bring the product from the manu facturer to the user, can be attributed to the water. In view of the fact that the person who carries out the processing of the pho tographic material normally also has water available, it is obvious to offer to the user a mixture of substances which is such that the photographic bath can be made up in a simple manner therefrom by addition of, or dissolution in, a given quantity of water. Although in principle it is possible for the user himself to make up photographic baths with the aid of a formula, this presents a number of problems in practice. Industrial preparations are fre quently the result of extensive research and development programmes and employ protected and or difficult to obtain base materials, as a result of which such a recipe is not directly freely available. The photographic baths composed in accordance with a published non protected recipe are often far from optimal as regards photographic properties. The abovementioned book by L.F.A. Mason, on page 141, deals with the two most important types of composite developers and re generation baths, namely liquid concentrates and powder mixtures. The liquid concentrates have the advantage of convenience in use the disadvantages are, inter alia, the relatively high costs of packaging compared to powders, the need to use water miscible or ganic solvents such as diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, and the danger of freezing under winter conditions. A powder has the advantage that it permits a very high con centration. The disadvantages are the additional requirements which the chemicals have to meet they must be solid, non volatile sub stances , the formation of dust from the fine material during the dissolution procedure, the need to package chemicals separately and the more troublesome metering and mixing procedures compared to liquids. In the chemical and related industries, dust control fur thermore has high priority working with chemical mixtures which may cause dust therefore has to be avoided from the point of view of industrial hygiene and health. In modern specialist photographic literature developer concen trates in broth or paste form according to Hübl, such as are described in the old photographic literature, for example the Aus führliches Handbuch der Photographie Detailed Handbook of Photo graphy , edited by Prof. Dr. J.M. Eder and Dr. Lüppo Cramer third volume, part two, published by Wilhelm Knapp, 1930 on page 123, are no longer encountered. This developer contains, as the de veloping agent, glycin or para hydroxyphenylaminoacetic acid and is prepared as follows 50 g of sodium sulphite heptahydrate are dissolved in 80 ml of hot water thereafter 20 g of glycin are added and subsequently 110 g of potassium carbonate are added slow ly. During this last procedure, 150 ml of a paste of good stability are formed, with evolution of carbon dioxide. In order to prepare a ready for use developer therefrom, 1 part by volume of the paste, which must first be stirred thoroughly, is taken and diluted with 15 parts by volume of water. However, this form of concentrate has, as far as uses are concerned, remained restricted to the glycin paste according to Hübl, since the disadvantages such as the need for stirring up and the somewhat more awkward metering of volumes clearly have not compensated for the advantages. Furthermore glycin as a developing agent has for decades been overtaken by other developers, such as the fine grain developers derived from phenylenediamine. Another important practical disadvantage of the paste form according to Hübl is furthermore the fact that on aging storage rather large, hard and difficult to dissolve crystals form. It has now been found that it is very readily possible to con vert all silver halide processing baths commonly used in the photo graphic and reprographic industries, such as developer baths, re generation baths, rejuvenation baths, stopping baths, fixing baths, bleaching baths, bleach fixing baths, intensifiers and reducers, into a stable and storable concentrate in paste form. It is essen tial to use therein a viscosity increasing and crystal growth in hibiting agent. It is known from the literature that certain poly meric compounds counteract the agglomeration of crystal through adsorption on the crystal surface. It is also known that substances from certain classes of water soluble organic solvents bring about a stabilization of the crystal surface, as a result of which pro cesses such as agglomeration are greatly slowed down see, for example, the book by A.L. Smith ed. Particle Growth in Sus pensions Academic Press, London, 1973 . Organic polymers such as carboxymethylcellulose, gelatine, agar agar, casein, alginates, po lyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidinone or organic water miscible solvents, such as methylcellosolve, ethylcellosolve, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, and their derivatives, appear to prevent the formation of large crystal lumps and thus have a favourable effect on the shelf life and the rate of dissolution of the concentrate. The concentrations achiev able are found to be even higher than those achievable via powder mixtures. Further, it has been found that the content of containers filled with the paste can be totally dissolved in a simple manner, to give a ready for use solution, in a device specially developed for the purpose, which can be operated manually or works automa tically, via squirting out and transferring into a mixing vessel, with a predetermined quantity of water. According to this aspect of the invention, the objections to the need for homogenization name ly stirring up and the difficulties to be expected in metering the paste volumes for the user have all been completely removed. Figure 1 shows an apparatus according to the invention, where by it is possible, using a predetermined quantity of water, to squirt empty the containers which have been filled with paste in the factory, and to transfer the contents into a mixing vessel. The operation of the apparatus may be described as follows A quantity of water in accordance with the instrucitons is in troduced into the mixing vessels 1 . Thereafter, the containers A and B , filled with paste, are introduced into the spaces 9 and 10 intended for the purpose and provided with removable lids. The pump 2 is then switched on as a result of which the water passes through the line 3 and squirts the paste out of the holders via nozzles 4 and 5 , under high pressure. The water paste mixture drops under gravity into the mixing vessel and in doing so passes a rapidly rotating cutter 7 mounted in a housing 6 , which cutter serves the purpose of comminuting any lumps which may still be present in the paste. In the housing 6 there are one or more orifices 8 which provide the connection between the housing 6 and the mixing vessel 1 . The abovementioned method prevents ex cessively large fragments from getting into the mixing vessel. In fact, the very intensive mixing in the housing 6 is intended to comminute lumps and fragments, through dissolution, so rapidly that they can still pass through the orifices in the housing into the mixing vessel. In the mixing vessel, stirring also takes place but this is less intensive than in the abovementioned housing. When the paste has completely dissolved in the mixing vessel, the solution thus obtained can be employed directly as a photographic processing bath. Finally, the invention relates to a pump arrangement compris ing a pump 2 , a line 3 connected to the pump housing and pro vided with one or more orifices 8 on its underside, a cutter 7 mounted on the pump shaft and two spaces 9 and 10 provided with a removable lid, and intended for the containers A and B filled with paste. The examples which follow illustrate the invention without limiting it. A two component developer concentrate having the following composition was prepared By diluting these components A and B, each having a volume of about 2 litres, with 25 litres of water, about 30 litres of ready for use photographic developer are obtained. It would have been preferable to combine the components A and B into a single component but this is not possible due to the in stability of the 1 phenylpyrazolid 3 one in a strongly alkaline me dium. A two component fixing concentrate having the following com position was prepared By diluting these components A and B, each having a volume of about 2 litres, with 25 litres of water, about 30 litres of ready for use fixing bath solution are obtained. It would have been preferable to combine the components A and B into one component this is however not possible due to the in stability of the ammonium thiosulphate at low pH values.
