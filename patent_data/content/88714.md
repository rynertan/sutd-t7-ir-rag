# Combined uterine injector and manipulative device.

## Abstract
A multi lumen catheter for uterine insertion having an inflatable member at its insertable end which when inflated seals the lower portion of the uterus to retain fluid or gas injected into the uterine cavity. A handle in place on the catheter has a cervical stop engageable with the external os of the cervix to limit catheter insertion. The inflatable member is shaped to prevent catheter tip contact with the uterine wall and to cooperate with the cervical stop to effect a positive attachment of the device to the uterus enabling manual posi tioning of the latter for examination purposes.
