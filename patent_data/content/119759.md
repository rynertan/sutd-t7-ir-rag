# Gate assembly for animal enclosure.

## Abstract
A gate assembly for an animal enclosure, such as a milking parlour, comprises a barrier 5 swingable about a pivot axis 15 and an angled rod 63 which is pivoted to an extension member 28 on the barrier 15 and which serves as an additional barrier. Rotation of a shaft 49 by handles not shown operates a lever assembly 27 to swing up the barrier 5 which in turn displaces the additional barrier 63 which is guided by a guide arm 65 in a bracket 66 .
