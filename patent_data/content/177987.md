# Field frequency doubling circuit.

## Abstract
By providing in a field frequency doubling circuit com prising a converter circuit 3 of an A, A, B, B, type, an inter polation circuit 31 which combines in an appropriate manner the information of two subjacent lines of the first field of a picture of the television signal to be converted and the second field of a picture of the television signal to be converted, line flicker can be prevented from occurring without it being necessary to provide a movement detector and a change over switch for an A, B, A, B type conversion.
