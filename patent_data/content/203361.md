# IMPROVED POLYESTER RESIN GELKOTE COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Coating compositions suitable for preparing gel coat composites comprise a hydroxy functional urethane extend ed polyesters having molecular weight below 2600 and mole ratios of hydroxyl group to urethane linkage of from 0.5 to 6 which are derived by condensation of fumaric acid and certain nonaromatic polyols and carboxyl acids or b acrylate resins having molecular weight up to 3,000 and ethylenically unsatu rated functionality attached to the acrylate backbone resin through ester or urethane linkages. Gel coat composites pre pared from those coatings using 10 to 50 weight percent aro matic vinyl monomer impart water boil resistance and high gloss retention.
