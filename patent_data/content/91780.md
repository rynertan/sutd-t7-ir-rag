# Development apparatus of latent electrostatic images.

## Abstract
A development apparatus includes an electrically con ductive sleeve 10 , which is provided with micro fine ink holding means 10a on its outer circumferential surface and which is arranged in an ink tank 11 for accommodating an electrically conductive liquid developer 12 , the sleeve 10 being arranged in an opposed relation to but not in contact with a photo sensitive drum 1 , whereby a latent electrosta tic image on the photosensitive drum 1 is developed by rotating the drum 1 and the sleeve 10 in opposite directions having a relative circumferential velocity.
