# Process for treating caramel colors.

## Abstract
Caramel color concentrates are prepared by subjecting a mixture of caramel color and water to ultrafiltration through a semi permeable membrane, wherein the pH and or ionic strength of the caramel color water mixture, at all or particular stages of the ultrafiltration process, is regulated so as to obtain desirable processing and product attributes, such as increased retention of desired properties of the starting caramel color, increased removal of low molecular weight materials during ultrafiltration and increased rates of ultrafiltration.
