# ION DETECTOR

## Abstract
An ion detector is disclosed herein and includes a conversion dynode for receiving at its input charged particles and for delivering at its output charged particles such that the latter particles leave the output of said dynode in a diffused manner and a microchannel electron multiplier disposed adjacent the conversion electrode to receive said diffused charged particles from the output of the conversion dynode and a collector electrode for receiving electrons exiting the microchannel plate. The ion detector also in cludes a resistive divider for providing voltages to said conversion dynode, across the microchannel plate and to said collector electrode.
