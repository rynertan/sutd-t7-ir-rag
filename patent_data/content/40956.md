# 8 Substituted 4 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinolines.

## Abstract
4 Phenyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinolines whose struc tures have two hydroxy groups substituted at the 3,4 position on the 4 phenyl ring have been found to have renal vasodilating activity upon internal administration. The active ingredients are prepared by cyclizing N 2 substituted benzyl 1 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl amino ethanol using either a Lewis acid or an acid cyclizing agent followed by demethylation at the 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl moiety.
