## Abstract
An improved engine construction is disclosed having a valve train including valves 21, 27 and corresponding valve stems 85 for controlling the intake 83 and exhaust ports 81 cams 53, 51 for imparting reciprocating motion to the valves by way of the valve train and a valve spring 89, 97, 99 for biasing each valve 21, 27 toward its closed position and the valve train into tracking relation with the cam. The only element of the valve train coupling a cam 51, 53 to a stem 85 is a cam follower 65, 67 with a depression 65 for receiving the corresponding stem end and a cam engaging surface opposite the depression with the cam follower being held captive intermediate 87 the stem and cam solely by the spring biasing of the stem toward the cam and the engage ment of the stem end and the depression. The spring biasing is provided by a coiled wire spring 99 having outwardly extending legs 84, 97 each of which engages a correspond ing stem 85 to urge the valves 21, 27 toward their closed position. The bight or coiled portion 99 of the spring is held in a relatively fixed position by a portion 73 of the engine casting.
