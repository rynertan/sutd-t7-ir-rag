# SLURRY PUMPING APPARATUS FOR SOLID LIQUID SEPARATION

## Abstract
The present invention relates is a slurry pumping apparatus for solid liquid separation. More specifically, the invention pro vides, in a slurry pumping apparatus arranged such that a diaphragm pump connected to an oil tank is actuated to deliver a hydraulic oil when a predetermined amount of slurry is supplied from a slurry tank to a solid fluid separator, such as a filter press, which obtains cake from slurry, a slurry pumping apparatus for solid liquid separation in which the diaphragm pump has its hydraulic pressure chamber connected to a supply discharge pump through a changeover operation of a changeover valve such that the slurry is pumped to the solid liquid separator by the operation of the diaphragm pump.
