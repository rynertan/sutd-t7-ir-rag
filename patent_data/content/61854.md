# Distilling apparatus which operates according to the thermocompressor principle.

## Abstract
The distilling apparatus 10 comprises a body part 11 , a boiling vessel 12 , a heat source 13 , a feed line 14 , a means 19 disposed to impart extra energy to the vapour formed in the boiling vessel 12 of the liquid to be distilled, an output line 25 for removing the distillate at least one heat exchange tube 17 , a droplet separator based on dynamic centrifugal separation, and a gush gap 18 . Preferably the means 19 is a blower disposed within the distilling apparatus 10 . The droplet separator is a droplet separator with helical vanes 20 . Within the boiling vessel 12 a waste pipe 16 is disposed. The vapour condensation volume 24 is disposed to surround the heat exchange tube 17 .
