## Description
INSTRUMENTS WITH MOVING MAGNETS This invention relates to instruments with moving magnets, such as flow meters or pressure gauges, in which at least one bar magnet is housed within a linearly movable characteristic responsive element hereinafter referred to as the transducing element , such as a plunger or piston, movable, as by fluid flow or pressure, in a guide extending parallel to the magnet against a spring urge or gravity , indicating means being actuated by a change in magnetic field as the magnet moves, such as a pointer on a scale as inGB PS 8134799 or electronic conversion to a digital display as in GB PS 2 123 964A. The object of the invention is to provide means whereby consistent readings of the indicating means are ensured for any specific linear position of the transducing element relative to the indicating means. According to the present invention1 means is provided to prevent rotation of the transducing element with respect to the guide. The invention takes account of the fact that the magnetic field at any position along a bar magnet is liable to vary around the magnet axis through 3600. In an instrument in which the transducing element has a cylindrical portion slidable in a guide bore, the rotation prevention means may d6mprise positively locating engagements between a part of a spring and the transducing element and between another part of the spring and the guide.Thus, a coil compression spring may have nonhelical end portions engaging non concentric formations on the transducing element and the guide, e.g. chordal end portions engaging flats, or longitudinally extending end portions engaging non axial holes. Alternatively, the rotation prevention means may be a splined engagement between the transducing element and the guide, e.g., balls located in depressions in the plunger engaging longitudinal grooves in the guide, or the transducing element may have a portion of noncircular cross section,e.g., square with bevelled or rounded corners, slidable in a bore of similar cross section in the guide. Again, the rotation prevention means may be a rod extending parallel to the transducing element and slidable in a bore extending parallel to the guide, with the rod extending as an outrigger from the transducing element into a bore alongside the guide, or with the rod extending from a support fixed in relation to the guide into a bore in the transducing element offset from its axis. A number of embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a fragmentary axial section through a flow meter showing a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a section on the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section on the lineIII III of Figure 1 Figure 4 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a second embodiment of the invention Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a third embodiment of the invention Figure 6 is a section on the lineVI VI of Figure 5 Figure 7 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a fourth embodiment of the invention Figure 8 is a section on the line VIII VIII of Figure 7 Figure 9 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a fifth embodiment of the invention Figure 10 correspnds to Figure 1 but shows a sixth and final embodiment of the invention and Figure 11 is an elevation in the direction of the arrow XI of Figure 10. In the Figures the flowmeter comprises a body 10, an inlet 11 leading to the smaller diameter end 12 of a tapered passage 13 in the body leading to an outlet 14, and annular seating 15 at the smaller end of the tapered passage and facing towards the larger end 16, a circular valve member 17, a spring 18 urging the valve member towards contact with the seating, a plunger 19 coaxial with the valve member and slidable in a guide member 20 within a bore 21 in the body, a bar magnet 22 in a coaxial bore 23 in the plunger, a screwthread 24 in the bore 23, a screw 25 mating with the screwthread for holding the magnet 22 captive in the bore. The bar magnet 22 is used in association with a magnetic detector consisting of either a circular magnet not shown or a Hall effect integrated circuit not shown housed in a blind bore 26 in the body, the magnetic detector being adapted to operate a pointer on a scale not shown or a liquid crystal display not shown for registering the rate of flow through the flowmeter. In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 3 rotation prevention means for the plunger 19 comprises chordal end portions 27, 28 of the spring 18 engaging flats 29, 30, respectively in the end of plunger 19 adjacent the valve member and in the guide member 20. In the embodiment shown in Figure 4 the rotation prevention means comprises longitudinally extending end portions 31, 32 engaging non axial holes 33, 34 in the plunger 19 and an annular flange 35 in the guide member 20 respectively. The end portion 32 also extends through the flange into hole 36 in the body 10. In the third embodiment shown inFigures 5 and 6 the rotation prevention means comprises radially displaced balls 37 located in depressions 38 in the plunger 19 and engaging longitudinal grooves 39 in the guide member. In the fourth embodiment shown inFigures 7 and 8 the rotation prevention means is provided by the plunger having a portion square cross section 40 slidable in a bore 41 of similar cross section in the guide member. In the fifth embodiment shown inFigure 9 the rotation prevention means comprises a rod 42 extending parallel to the plunger and slidable in a bore 43 extending parallel to the guide member with the rod 42 extending as an outrigger from the plunger into the bore 43 or alternatively as in the sixth embodiment shown in Figures 10 and 11 the rod 42 extends from a support 44 fixed in relation to the guide member into a bore 45 in the plunger offset from its axis.
