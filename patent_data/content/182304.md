# A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR DISPENSING POWDERED MATERIALS

## Abstract
In a method of dispensing powder which when being dis charged forms an arch or bridge above the outlet from a gas tight container comprising an inner converging part with an outlet opening, wherein gas or air is introduced through open ings in the converging part of the container and discharges the powder, air or gas is added discontinuously and in an exactly metered quantity to dispenso a certain quantity of powder which is dependant only upon the added quantity of fluidization air or gas. Dispensing is stopped by closing the supply of fluidi zation air, which is then used to transport pneumatically the powder to a location of use at the same time as the air presses a flap against the outlet from the container and closes it. An apparatus for carrying out the method comprises an upper container 1 and an inner converging part 4 with an outlet 7 , said upper part 1 being closed in an airtight manner, pref erably by a lid 2 , and connected to the converging part 4 which is enclosed in an airtight manner by a part 1 which may be an extension of the part 1 , the converging part 4 be ing equipped with openings 4 for fluidization air or gas which may be added via the part 1 through a closable pipe 10 . The converging part 4 is of a material consisting of threads, preferably woven cloth, connected to the part 1 by an attach ment arrangement 5 and to an outlet pipe 7 attached to the part 1 and opening into a pipe 9 , which accommodates a flap 8 which can shut the opening of the pipe 7 , and that the pipe 9 and the pipe 10 are connected to a source of air 12 via a multidirectional adjustable valve 11 .
