# DEVICE FOR FIXING THE CUTTING INSERT TO THE SUPPORT IN A SECTIONAL MILLING CUTTER

## Abstract
The cutting insert 4 of a sectional milling cutter is fixed between two surfaces respectively of the support 2 and the fixing bracket, by means of a socket head screw 13. So as to position insert 4 rapidly and precisely, with constant cutting profile, the face 2 of the support is equipped with two surface plates 8 and 8 which project and converge together at an angle of approx. 75 . In correspondence, the cutting insert 4 has seats or apertures 6 and 6 , forming a wedge which has an aperture angle equal to that of the planes 8 and 8 so that they can be coupled perfectly. The cutting insert 4 has an elliptical profile with two cutting surfaces 5 and 5 and with two apertures or seats 6 and 6 which are placed opposite each other and are superimposed by rotating the insert around the two respec tive transverse axes. On the apex of one of the two apertures 6 acts and presses the extremity 9 of the arc surface 9 which delimits the surface plate 2 and which extends parallel to the cutting surface 5 or 5 .
