# Method of rolling railroad rails and steels of similar shape by universal rolling.

## Abstract
A method for multiple pass rolling of railroad rails in a universal rolling mill having horizontal rolls and vertical rolls, comprising measuring the axial displacement of the horizontal rolls and the radial displacement of the vertical rolls when a blank passes through a roll caliber defined by the horizontal and vertical rolls. The measurements include the relation of the displacement of the horizontal and verti cal rolls and the difference of the rolling forces acting on the rolls each of the two vertical rolls. The values of the rolling forces of the vertical rolls during the intented pas ses, can be calculated, by arithmetic operations, indepen dently of the above mentioned measuring so as to estimate the axial displacements of the horizontal rolls and radial displacements of the vertical rolls before the rolling by consequent pass is actually performed. On the basis of the calculated values and of the above mentioned relation. The roll gap settings between the horizontal rolls and the ver tical rolls can be made that permits the controlled conse cutive passes by a universal rolling mill.
