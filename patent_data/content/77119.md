## Abstract
Blood plasma that has been collected using heparin or sodium heparin or a mixture thereof as the sole anticoagulant is frozen, the plasma is resolubilised, a cryoprecipitate obtained from the resolubilised plasma is resolubilised, a saline solution containing heparin is added to the resolubilised cryoprecipitate and the product is incubated to produce a precipitate that is rich in Factor VIII and cold insoluble globulin, and Factor VIII is isolated from this precipitate.
