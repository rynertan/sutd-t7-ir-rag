# Precipitation loss compensation and disablement for avoidance of satellite transponder overloading.

## Abstract
A transmiting power control system is disclosed where in a master earth station sends a pilot signal to a satellite which retransmits it to the master station as well as to slave earth stations. A beacon signal is also sent from the satellite to the master station which compares it with the received pilot signal and controls its own transmission power level according to the result of the comparison so that the power level of retransmitted pilot signal is maintained constant. A warning signal is sent from the master station to all the slave stations when the received pilot signal decreases below a prescribed value corresponding to a predetermined precipi tation. Each slave station receives the pilot signal from the satellite and controls its own trasmission power level according to the received pilot signal. A disabling circuit is provided in each slave station to disable the power control function of the own station in response to the warning signal to prevent the satellite from being overloaded by the information signals transmitted from the slave earth sta tions.
