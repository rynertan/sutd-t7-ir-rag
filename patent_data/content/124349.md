# Remote control unit.

## Abstract
A remote operating unit for hand control of movable con trol members such as a steering actuator bar and a three posi tion drive control switch actuator bar of a battery electric model vehicle is described. A handset 1 incorporates an ac tuator bar 3 mounted for translational and rotational movement by handle 18. Translational movement thereof in guide slot 17 compresses or expands diaphragm 4 in chamber 16 to transmit steering movement via a flexible pipe 6 and a slave diaphragm chamber 22 to the steering actuator bar, rotational movement of actuator bar 3 is transmitted to diaphragm 4 of chamber 15 and thence via another flexible pipe 6 and slave diaphragm chamber 22 to the drive control switch actuator bar. The hand set may be removed from the vehicle by releasing connector 7 therefrom.
