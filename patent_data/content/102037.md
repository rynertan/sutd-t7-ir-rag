## Abstract
A clutch drum for a multiple plate clutch assembly is disclosed. The clutch drum comprises a tubular body having a large diameter tubular section and a small diameter tubular section. An end plug is secured to the small diameter tubular section and has a tubular flange fit on the outer surface of the small diameter tubular section. The tubular flange is formed with axially extending slots. First clutch plates are disposed in the large diameter section and splined to the large diameter tubular section. Second clutch plates are disposed around the small diameter tubular section and engaged with axially extending slots of the tubular flange of the end plug. A clutch piston is slidably disposed in the small diameter tubular section.
