# Monostable type relay.

## Abstract
A monostable relay comprises a bar like core having a coil, and a yoke connected to the core and extending in paral lel therewith. An armature including a permanent magnet is laterally movably disposed between a pair of upstanding legs formed at a free end of the yoke. Movable contacts are opera tionally coupled to the armature. The upstanding legs of the yoke have effective areas of magnetic pole differing from each other. Upon energiztion of the coil, the armature is moved toward the upstanding leg having the smaller magnetic pole area to close one of the stationary contacts by overcoming the resilient resistance of the movable contact arm. Upon deenergization, the movable contact is restored to the other stationary contact under the resilient restoring force of the movable contact arm.
