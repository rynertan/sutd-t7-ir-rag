## Description
This application is related to the commonly owned European patent applications 86 400 507.9 and 86 400 505.3 respectively entitled Apparatus To Transform A Single Frequency, Linearly Polarized Laser Beam Into A Beam With Two, Orthogonally Polarized Frequencies , and Apparatus To Transform A Single Frequency, Linearly Polarized Laser Beam Into A High Efficiency Beam with Two Orthogonally Polarized Frequencies both of which name Gary E. Sommargren as sole inventor thereto and both of which are contemporaneously filed herewith The present invention relates to gauging apparatus of the optical interferometer type. More particularly, the invention relates to apparatus which uses two optical frequencies to measure accurately either changes in length or changes in optical length. The use of optical interferometry to measure changes in either length, distance, or optical length has grown significantly due not only to technological advances in lasers, photosensors, and microelectronics but also to an ever increasing demand for high precision, high accuracy measurements. The prior art interferometers can be generally categorized into two types based on the signal processing technique used, i.e., either homodyne or heterodyne, see for example, H. Matsumoto, Recent Interferometric Measurements Using Stabilized Lasers , In accordance with the invention as defined in Claim 1, we provide a heterodyne interferometer system capable of measuring accurately either changes in length or changes in optical length The reader is also referred to US A 4188122 which discloses an interferometer which splits a beam into two collinear components, these components being frequency shifted and orthogonalised, before recombination. This device uses a polarising beam splitter, two Bragg cells, two mirrors and a polarising beam recombiner. In the drawings FIG. 1 depicts in schematic form an embodiment of the instant invention. While the apparatus has application for a wide range of radiation sources, the following description is taken by way of example with respect to an optical measuring system. The term radiant energy as used herein includes electromagnetic energy of all frequency ranges. A light source 10 comprising a laser provides a beam 12 of optical energy which has a single, stabilized frequency and is linearly polarized. Light source 10 can be any of a variety of lasers. For example, it can be a gas laser, e.g., a helium neon, stabilized in any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art to produce beam 12 , see for example, T. Baer et al, Frequency stabilization of a 0.633µm He Ne longitudinal Zeeman laser , For ease of understanding, the pertinent portions of the A 0 device 20 described in this European patent application shall be repeated herein with reference to figures 4 and 5 which correspond to figures 1 and 2, respectively, of this patent application, with the exception that the reference numerals have been changed to avoid confusion where necessary. As shown in figure 4, light source 10 is the same as described above with reference to figure 1 and provides a beam 12 of optical energy which has a single, stabilized frequency and is linearly polarized. As previously mentioned, light source 10 can be any of a variety of lasers. As already shown in figure 1, for some sources, e.g. a diode laser, it is necessary to use beam forming optics 14 , e.g. a microscope objective, to provide an input beam 18 with a suitable diameter and divergence for the elements that follow. When source 10 is a helium neon laser, for example, beam forming optics 14 may not be required. The elements 10 and 14 are shown in a dashed box 16 which is the source of the input beam 18 which has one stabilized frequency f Beams 140 and 142 are incident on birefringent prism 144 which is made of a crystal e.g. quartz with the optical axis to the apex edge. The apex angle α is chosen to satisfy the equation where n In some instances, where the desired frequency shift is 20 MHz or greater, the present invention may be simplified by eliminating f₁ in electrical signal 32 i.e., f₁ 0 causing beam 142 to have the same direction of propagation and frequency as input beam 18 but otherwise not altering the operation of the invention. Beams 40 and 50 are collinear but are shown displaced in FIG. 1 for clarity, have nearly equal intensity, are orthogonally polarized, and differ in frequency by the frequency of the reference electrical signal, i.e., f The diagonal 73 is the beam splitter surface of polarization beamsplitter 72 . Thus, beam 40 is transmitted by polarization beamsplitter 72 to produce beam 42 , and beam 50 is reflected by polarization beamsplitter 72 to produce beam 52 . Beam 52 is retroreflected by retroreflector 74 to produce beam 54 which is in turn again reflected by polarization beamsplitter 72 to produce beam 56 . Retroreflector 74 is fixed relative to polarization beamsplitter 72 . Retroreflectors 74 and 76 maintain the state of polarization between their output and input beams. Thus, beam 54 is pure The frequency of the measurement signal 66 , is given by equation The output 80 , which is proportional to the displacement of the moving retroreflector 76 , is derived by integrating the frequency difference between the measurement signal 66 and the reference signal 32 . Integrating the subtracted frequencies above is equivalent to adding the phase differences between them on a cycle by cycle basis. FIG. 2 depicts in schematic form the block diagram of the phase meter accumulator 68 . Sinusoidal measurement signal 66 is converted by square wave generator 78 into square wave measurement signal 67 , shown in detail in FIG. 3c. Sinusoidal reference signal 32 is converted by square wave generator 79 into square wave reference signal 33 , shown in detail in FIG. 3a. Signal 33 is then converted by triangular wave generator 81 into triangular wave reference signal 82 , shown in detail in FIG. 3b. Signal 82 is sampled by a high speed analog to digital converter 83 every cycle of the measurement signal 67 FIG. 3b and 3c . The digital output 84 of the analog to digital converter 83 is proportional to the phase of the reference signal at the sampling instant. The phase difference output 87 is derived by the phase difference calculator 86 from the digital output 84 of the analog to digital converter 83 and the corresponding previous cycle output 85 which was kept in a memory register 92 . The phase difference output 87 is the measure of phase difference between the reference signal 32 and the measurement signal 66 at each sampling instant. For example, in FIG. 3 the phase difference output 87 at the instant of sample i will be derived by The phase differences 87 that are calculated at each cycle of the measurement signal are added to the content of the accumulator 88 . The output 80 of the accumulator 88 , which is the sum of phase differences is proportional to the displacement of the moving retroreflector 76 . The measured displacement d is given by the equation where As indicated by the equation above, the measurement resolution is given by With a 7 bit analog to digital converter 83 , for instance, the measurement resolution is In the measurement system described in Bagley et al, U.S. Patent 3,656,853 issued April 18, 1972, to increase the measurement resolution beyond By contrast, in the instant invention where the measurement resolution is determined by the number of bits of the analog to digital converter 83 , a high measurement resolution can be maintained without requiring a reduction in the maximum allowable velocity of the moving retroreflector. Furthermore, the use of a relatively high frequency difference between beams 40 and 50 as opposed to the limited frequency difference attained by using a Zeeman split laser source, enhances the instant invention s measurement capability at substantially higher velocities of the moving retroreflector 76 . In addition, using an oscillator 30 to generate the frequency difference between beams 40 and 50 in the instant invention, enables the generation of the reference signal 32 from that frequency and eliminates the need for a second optical mixer which is required in the system described in the aforementioned Bagley et al, U.S. patents. The principal advantages of the instant invention are 1 increased measurement resolution, 2 the capability to measure rapidly changing lengths or optical lengths, 3 requires only one optical mixer, and 4 the ability to use a broad range of laser sources. While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, obviously modification can be made therein, without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims
