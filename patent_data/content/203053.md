# Apparatus for detecting sudden changes of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus for detecting sud den changes of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements, said feature being represented by complex valued signals, one for each picture element, the signal phase representing the feature type and the signal amplitude representing the certainty in the feature assertion. The apparatus includes a first unit 3 for providing the signals 10 within the region and at least a second unit for providing at least one set of complex valued multiplication factors 11, 12, 13 that corresponds to those signals. The apparatus furth er has a third unit 4 for forming a said measurement signal consisting of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of a first sum signal, which consists of the complex valued pro ducts of the signal 10 and corresponding multiplication factors 11, 12, 13 , and a second sum signal, which consists of the complex valued products of the signals and correspond ing conjugate multiplication factors. A fourth unit 5 is pro vided for a complex valued coefficient weighted summation of a function, which depends on the multiplication factors, of the measurement signals from the third unit 4 .
