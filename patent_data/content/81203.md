# Jaw crusher.

## Abstract
The jaw crusher according to the present invention comprises a stationary toothed plate disposed nearly vertically and a moving toothed plate oscillated by a motor, which are placed opposite to each other and which define together a crushing chamber of a V like longitudinal section. In the compression chamber, namely, in the upper space of this crushing chamber, the raw stones are subject to rubbing action and further to crushing action in the striking chamber, that is, in the lower space of the crushing chamber. Thus, relatively large stones can be crushed to fine particles or pieces. The moving toothed plate of this jaw crusher is installed as slanted about 15 to 25 from the vertical. The toggle plate installed below the swing jaw to which the moving toothed plate is fixed is placed higher on the side of the swing jaw, and lower on the side of toggle sheet block, a maximum compression point being set on the line extending from the toggle plate or in the proximity thereof within the crushing chamber. The moving toothed plate is curved at the portion thereof below the maximum compression point toward the swing jaw. By pivoting the eccentric shaft coupled to the top of the swing jaw, the motion of the moving toothed plate toward the stationary toothed plate can be converted to a motion of striking from above obliquely downward, and the moving toothed plate is moved nearly straight in the oblique direction at the maximum compression point.

## Description
Background of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention relates to a jaw crusher of which a stationary toothed plate and a moving toothed plate driven by a motor are arranged opposite to each other between which raw stones are supplied and crushed, and morse particularly, to a single toggle type jaw crusher.Description of the Prior Art There have been proposed various single toggle type jaw crushers a typical one comprises, as shown in Figure 1, a stationary toothed plate 100 and moving toothed plate 101 disposed opposite to each other and which form together a crushing chamber 102 having a V like longitudinal section. The stationary toothed plate 100 is fixed to a frame 103, while the moving toothed plate 101 is fixed to a swing jaw 104 of which the top is coupled to an eccentric shaft 106 of a flywheel 105 and the bottom is supported by a toggle plate 107. The moving toothed plate 101 fixed to the swing jaw 104 is cooperative with the flywheel 105 and toggle plate 107 to effect crushing and hulling or grinding motions.In this prior art jaw crusher, the flywheel 105 is rotationally driven to rotate the eccentric shaft 106 at a speed of 180 to 450 rpm, thereby swinging the swing jaw 104. The moving toothed plate 101 made to swing with the swing jaw 104 is moved delineating a maximum circle at the top thereof, and the circular motion becomes elliptic and further elongated el lipse as the bottom of the toothed plate 101 is approached. The moving toothed plate 101 moves at the points A to D thereof upward from below with respect to the stationa ry toothed plate 100 so that stones within the crushing chamber 102 will be hulled or ground while being moved upward.The outlet of the crushing chamber 102 is formed as a non choking chamber 102a because both the toothed plates 100 and 101 are curved toward the frame 103 so that crushed stones will not be blocked when being let out. i The reference numeral 108 in Figure 1 denotes a spherical roller bearing, 109 indicates a bearing box, 110 is a side liner, 111 is a toggle sheet, 112 is a contact between the toggle sheet 111 and toggle plate 107, 113 is a toggle sheet block, and 114 indicates a hydraulic jack for extrusion of the toggle sheet block. Such prior art jaw crusher is used for coarse crush ing, namely, for producing crushed stones of 35 to 80 mm in grain size. Such grain sizes are too large for the crushed stones to be used as concrete aggregates. Accordingly, such crushed stones are to be further crushed by a repulsion crusher or cone crusher to smaller grain size. In the j.aw.crusher shown in Figure 1, for example, assume that the raw stone inlet is dimensioned to be 900 x 600 mm, the outlet clearance is 80 mm and the eccentric shaft is rotated at a speed of 250 rpm. In these conditions, raw stones of about 150 mm in maximum diameter supplied into the crushing chamber 102 will be crushed to the order of 80 mm in grain size and drop from the non choking crushing chamber 102a.The crushed stones of such grain size may not be used as concrete aggregates they are crushed again by a cone crusher to a grain size of about 5 to 30 mm. For further fine crushing, a ball mill or rod mill must be used. The conventional jaw crusher cannot crush raw stones of 150 to 300 mm in maximum diameter to a grain size of less than 5 to 30 mm.However, a prior art jaw crusher is known which can crush raw stones of less than 60 mm in grain size to a grain size of about 20 mm. Nevertheless, such jaw crusher is limited for use to raw stones of a grain size less than 60 mm raw stones of more than 60 mm in grain size cannot beoreceived by the crushing chamber. Namely, to obtain crushed stones of about 2 0 mm in grain sife in the prior art jaw crusher, a pretreatment is necessary for cdnditioning the raw stones to a grain size of less than 60 mm. That is, the prior art jaw crusher cannot pro duce crushed stones of less than 30 mm in grain size or further fine stones or sand directly from large raw stones, requiring the secondary and or third treatment of the crushed stones obtained from the jaw crusher.This is very expensive. A1 though the outlet clearance of the prior art jaw crusher can be reduced for fine crushing, it takes a very long time so that the output per hour is extremely low. Summary of the Invention The present invention has a primary object to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art jaw crusher and two provide a jaw crusher which can crush relatjvely large raw stones to a grain size of less than 20 mm or a size of sand with a high power and in a short time. The foregoing and other objects of the present in vention can be attained by a jaw crusher of which a N stationary toothed plate and moving toothed plate driven by a motor, which formstogether a crushing chamber of aV like longitudinal section and in which raw stones supplied are crushed, characterized according to the present invention, in that said stationary toothed plate is nearly vertically disposed while said moving. toothed plate is installed as slanted about 15 to 250 from the vertical a toggle plate installed at the bottom of a swing jaw to which said moving toothed plated is fixed is placed higher on the swing jaw side and lower on a toggle sheet block side, a maximum compression point being set on a line extending from the toggle plate or in the proximity thereof within said crushing chamber said moving toothed plate is curved at the portion below said maximum compression point toward the swing jaw an eccentric shaft coupled to the top of said swing jaw is pivoUd in the direction of the stationary toothed plate to convert th e motionof the moving toothed plate toward the stationary toothed plate to a motion of striking from above obliquely downward , and the moving toothed plate is moved nearly straightly as slanted. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be better understood from the ensuing explanation made by way of example of the embodiments according to the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Referring now to Figure 3 and subsequent drawings, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explahed below The jaw crusher according to the present invention comprises, as illustrated, a stationary toothed plate 2 fixed to a frame 1, a moving toothed plate 4 fixed to a swing jaw 3, an eccentric shaft 5 coupled to the top of the swing jaw 3 which oscillates the swing jaw 3, and a toggb plate 6 installed to the rear side of the swing jaw 3. The stationary toothed plate 2 and moving toothed plate 4 are placed opposite to each other, defining between them a crushing chamber 7 of aV like longitudinal section. By oscillating the swing jaw 3 with the rotation of the eccentric shaft 5, raw stones in the crushing chamber 7 are crushed.Said eccentric shaft 5 is installed to a flywheel 8 of which the rotation causes the eccentric shaft 5 to rotate. The line extending from the toggle plate 6 passes by a point where the stationary toothed plate 2 and moving toothed plate 4 are nearest each other, namely, a maximum compression point 7a. Said stationary toothed plate 2 is composed of two members. More particularly, the stationary toothed plate 2 consists of an upper stationary toothed plate 21 provided nearly vertically and which is flat, and a lower stationary toothed plate 22 provided below said upper stationary toothed plate 21.The portion 22a, below the maximum compression point 7a, of the lower stationary toothed plate 22 and the portion 42 also below the maximum compression point 7a, of the moving toothed plate 4 are curved away from each other, and these lower portions 22a and 42 form together an outlet 7b between them. The space in which the lower stationary toothed plate is located in the crushing chamber 7 is a striking chamber 7c including the maximum compression point 7a, of which the upper space serves as a compression chamber 7d. In Figure 2 the reference numeral 9 indicates a side liner, 10 is a bearing box, 11 is a toggle sheet block which receives the toggle plate 6, and 12 is a tensioning member to pull the lower end of the swing jaw 3.Said stationary toothed plate 2 is disposed nearly vertically, while the moving toothed plate 4 is provided as slanted about 150 to 250 from the vertical. Said toggle plate 6 is placed higher on the side of the swing jaw 3, and lower on the side of the toggle sheet block 11. The maximum compression point 7a within the crushing chaztiei 7 is set on the line extending from the toggle plate 6 or in the proximity thereof. bwing to the construct iont ofwthe toggle plate 6, the motion of the moving toothed plate 4 at the points E to H as shown inFigure 4 with respect to the stationary toothed plate 2 is converted to a motion from above obliquely downward, that is ,to a tmotion of striking raw stones in the crushing chamber 7 to the stationary toother plate 2.Particularly, the moving toothed plate moves nearly straightly in the oblique direction at the maximum compression point 7a the stones are thus crushed iin the striking chamber 7c. As obvious from the motion of the moving toothed plate 4 shown in Figure 3, the stones are rubbed in the compression chamber 7d in the upper portion of the crush ing chamber 7, and they are subject to crushing in the striking chamber 7c. More particularly, in the compression chamber 7d, the stones are rubbed so that they are apt to be broken along its peculiar pattern, resulting in many flat and bar shaped pieces. The bar like pieces are crushed finely in the striking chamber 7c. The lower stationary toothed plate 22 of the stationary toothed plate 2 is provided with an engagement protrusion 22b which is fitted into an engagement concavity 2 a formed in the lower end of the upper stationary toothed plate 21. The lower stationary toothed plate 22 has formed at the lower end thereof an engagement concavity 22into which a protrusion 14 fixed as welded to a sliding plate 13 is engaged. The sliding plate 13 is installed to a screw 15 and mowable forward or reverse by the rotation of the screw 15.When the lower stationary toothed plate 22 has been abraded, resuLting in decreased work efficiency, the screw can be turned to move the sliding plate 13 forward. Thus, the lower portion 22a of the lower stationary toothed plate 22 can be moved in the direction of the moving toothed plate 4. By inserting a wedge plate 16 into the clearance taking place at the back of the sliding plate 13 as shown in Figure 5 , the crushing ability at the maximum compression point 7a and in the strikingchamber 7c can be restored to the extent before the abrasion.The lower stationary toothed plate 22 has formed at the back thereof a recess 22d as shown in Figures 6 and 7, and the surface of the lower stationary toothed plate 22 is sloped at an angle a of about 28.50. This lower stationary toothed plate 22 should preferably be dimensioned to be about 730 x 280 mm, by way of example. Said moving toothed plate 4 and upper stationary toothed plate 21 have teeth 4b and 21b, respectively, as shown in Figure 8, which are shaped to a height of 25 mm or so, for example. Also, the moving toothed plate 4 may be composed, like the stationary toothed plate 2, of two members. As shown in Figure 9, it is composed of an upper moving toothed plate 41 and lower moving toothed plate 42 the latter alone may be so constructed as to be replaceable. The embodiment shown in Figure 10 comprises two swing 3aws 3 to eachaof which a moving toothed plate4 is tied. A partition wall 17 is provided between these moving toothed plates 4 to form two crushing chambers 7.These moving toothed plates 4 are alternately moved vertically. In this embodiment, the stationary toothed plate 2, tDggle plate 6, etc. are constructed similarly to those of the jaw crusher shown in Figure 3. That is, the stationary toothedplate 2 is provided nearly vertically, each of the moving toothed plates 4 is installed as slanted about 150 to 25 from the vertical, each of the two toggle plates 6 is placed higher on the side of the swing jaw 3 with respect to the moving toothed plates 4, and lower on the side of the toggle sheet block 11, and a maximum compression point 7a is set on the line extending from each toggle plate 6 or in the proximity thereof within each of the crushing chambers 7.Each of the moving toothed plates 4 is curved at the portion thereof below each of the maximum compression pdints 7a toward each of the swing jaws 3. By rotating the eccentric shaft 5 in the direction of the stationary toothed plate 2, the motion of each of the moving toothed plates 4 toward the stationary toothed plate 2 can be converted to a motion of striking from above obliquely downward, and the moving toothed plate 4 each can be moved nearly straightly as slanted at each of the maximum compression points 7a, which are also the same as in the jaw crusher shown inFigure 3. In this embodiment, the two swing jaws 3 and moving .toothed plates 4 are fitted to a single eccentric shaft 5 so that when one of the two moving toothed plates 4 is at the highest position, the other is at the lowest position.Namely, they are moved alternately like a pair of pedals of a bicycle. Such construction is ad vantageous over a single. moving toothed plate equal to two moving toothed plates A, as follows First, no large torque is necessary at time of start during operation, a balance is well maintained since when one of the moving toothed plates 4 strikes the stationary toothed plate 2, the other is away from the stationary toothed plate 2, the crushed stones in the crushing chamber 7 in which the moving toothed plate 4 is away from the stationary toothed plate 2 are forced to be discharged due to the vibration transmitted from the neighboring crushing chamber 7.On the other hand, in case no partition wall 17 is provided between the two moving toothed plates 4, the crushed stones in one of the crushing chambers 7 move to the other chamber, which causes the crushing ability of the crusher to be decreased about 20 as compared with the case in which the partition wall is provided between the moving toothed plates. Figure 11 shows a variation of the present invention in which two moving toothed plates 4 are employed and they are formed as a trapezoid of which the top side is shorter than the bottom side. It is intended by this construction to improve the crushing capacity by increasing the lower volume of the crushing chamber 7 to accomodate the increase in volume of the raw stones when crushed. Of course, the stationary toothed plates 2 provided opposite to these moving toothed plates 4 are formed as a trapezoid corresponding to the shape of the moving toothed plates 4 this is not shown in Figure 11 . The moving andwstationa√ßy toothed plates 4 and 2 shown in Eigure 3.ay, of ourse, be shaped similarly as trapezoid. As having been explained in the foregoing, the raw stones are subjected to rubbing action in the crushing chamber 7 and compression chamber 7a, and to crushing action in the striking chamber 7c in the jaw crusher according to the present invention, thus permitting to crush relatively large stones to fine crushed stones or sandlike pieces, and with a comparable crushing capability to that of the prior art jaw crusher for coarse crushing.
