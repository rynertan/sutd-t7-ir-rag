## Description
The present invention relates to a novel immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility. In an enzymatic reaction, usually, it is preferred to carry out the reaction in a homogeneous system wherein an enzyme is dissolved. On the other hand, after the reaction is completed, it is desired that the enzyme can be readily separated from the reaction system. In view of this, immobilized enzymes having reversible soluble insoluble properties have been studied. As such immobilized enzymes, for example, the following immobilized enzymes have been known 1 lysozyme immobilized on alginic acid see Biotechnology and Bioengineering, However, these known techniques have various disadvantages. For example, the immobilized enzyme 1 is liable to be inactivated because it is required to reduce pH to 2.5 to precipitate it. In addition, since the enzyme is insoluble in an organic solvent, it can not be used then a substrate is soluble in an organic solvent or a solution containing an organic solvent but insoluble in water. In the immobilized enzymes of 2 and 5 , pH should be changed to a great extent in order to attain a complete precipitated state as well as a completely dissolved state and, therefore, pH suitable for the reaction is limited. The immobilized enzyme 3 requires strict conditions for immobilization and is liable to be inactivated. In addition, the use thereof is limited because the enzyme is readily precipitated in the presence of a monovalent cation such as sodium or potassium ion which usually exists in an enzymatic reaction and, therefore, such an ion can not be added. Moreover, the immobilized enzyme 4 has some problems. For example, a carrier thereof is difficult to prepare and the enzyme is liable to leak. Further, it is difficult to use in an organic solvent system since the enzyme is insoluble in an organic solvent. Thus, development of an immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility i.e. soluble insoluble immobilized enzymes which are free from the above disadvantages has been desired. As the result of intensive study, the present inventors have succeeded in preparing an immobilized enzyme which can readily and reversibly transfer from a dissolved state to a precipitated state and have a high activity as well as a high solubility even in an organic solvent or in a solution containing an organic solvent. The main object of the present invention is to provide novel immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility which have a high activity and can dissolve even in an organic solvent or in a solution containing an organic solvent. This object as well as other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided an immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility which comprises an enzyme attached to a copolymer of two or more monomers selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid or an alkyl ester thereof, methacrylic acid or an alkyl ester or dialkylamino alkyl ester thereof, and a vinylpyridine derivative of the general formula I In the present invention, the above copolymer hereinafter referred to as the carrier is attached to the enzyme by means of a covalent bond or an ionic bond. The carrier used in the present invention includes a copolymer composed of two or more monomers selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid or alkyl acrylate such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, etc. methacrylic acid or alkyl methacrylate such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, etc., or dialkylamino alkyl methacrylate such as dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, etc. and the vinylpyridine of the general formula I such as 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine. Among them, the preferred copolymer is, for example, a copolymer composed of 2 or 3 monomers selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine, dimethylamnoethyl methacrylate and the like. Another preferred copolymer is methacrylic acid alkyl methacrylate alkyl acrylate copolymer, methacrylic acid alkyl methacrylate copolymer, alkyl acrylate methacrylic acid copolymer, alkyl acrylate methacrylic acid alkyl acrylate copolymer, alkyl acrylate methacrylic acid 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine copolymer or dialkylamino alkyl methacrylate alkyl methacrylate copolymer. Examples of such a copolymer include methacrylic acid methyl methacrylate methyl acrylate copolymer, methyl methacrylate methacrylic acid copolymer, methyl acrylate methacrylic acid copolymer, methyl acrylate methacrylic acid octyl acrylate copolymer, methyl acrylate methacrylic acid 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine copolymer, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer and the like. Among them, the copolymer containing about 10 60 of free acrylic acid or methacrylic acid is especially preferred as the carrier for the immobilized enzyme of the present invention in which an enzyme is immobilized on the carrier by a covalent bond. And the copolymer containing 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or the like is particularly preferable as the carrier for the immobilized enzyme of the present invention in which an enzyme is immobilized on the carrier by an ionic bond. In the present invention, the enzyme to be attached to the above carrier is not limited to a specific one and, for example, the following enzymes can be preferably used. Amino acid oxidase, uricase, catalase, xanthine oxidase, glucose oxidase, glucose 6 phosphodehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, tyrosinase, lactate dehydrogenase, peroxidase, 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and the like. Aspartate acetyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glycine aminotransferase, glutamicoxaloacetic aminotransferase, glutamic pyruvic aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase, histamine methyl transferase, pyruvate kinase, fructokinase, hexokinase, ε lyzine acetyltransferase, leucine aminopeptidase and the like. Asparaginase, acetylcholine esterase, aminoacylase, amylase, arginase, L arginine deiminase, invertase, urease, uricase, esterase,β galactosidase, kallikrein, chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, naringinase, nucleotidase, papain, hyaluronidase, plasmin, pectinase, hesperiginase, pepsin, penicillinase, penicilline amidase, phospholipase, phosphatase, lactase, lipase, ribonuclease, rennin, cellulase and the like.

Aranine racemase, glucose isomerase, glucose phosphate isomerase, glutamate racemase, lactate racemase, methionine racemase and the like. Asparagin synthase, glutathion synthase, pyruvate synthase and the like. The above enzymes are not necessarily highly purified, and they may be extracts derived from animal or vegetable sources or from microorganisms, or partly purified products thereof. Further, in the present invention, not only one enzyme, but also two or more enzymes can be simultaneously attached to the carrier. The above enzyme can be attached to the carrier by a covalent bond or an ionic bond. The covalent bond can be formed by a conventional method such as formation of an acid amide bond between the carrier and the enzyme. For example, this can be performed by reacting the carrier and the enzyme in a solvent in the presence of a condensation agent. As a condensation agent, for example, a peptide condensation agent such as a water soluble carbodiimide is preferred. As a solvent, for example, water and a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and the like can be preferably used. The reaction can be carried out by dissolving the carrier in a solvent in a concentration of about 1 5 , adding the enzyme about 0.1 3 parts by weight per 1 part by weight of the carrier , adding a condensation agent thereto, and stirring the resulting mixture at a temperature of about 10 C or lower. The ionic bond can be formed by stirring the carrier and the enzyme in a solvent. The same solvent as that used for the above formation of the covalent bond can be used. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of about 10 C or lower. The immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility thus formed, regardless of by means of either the covalent or the ionic bond, can be readily separated from a reaction mixture as a precipitate by either adjustment of pH of the reaction mixture or coexistence of calcium ion in the reaction mixture. The immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility thus obtained is soluble in water as well as in an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or the like. Therefore, even if a water insoluble substrate is used, an enzymatic reaction can be efficiently carried out in a homogeneous system by dissolving the substrate and the immobilized enzyme in an organic solvent. This is one of advantageous characteristics of the immobilized enzyme of the present invention. Another advantageous characteristic of the immobilized enzyme having reversible solubility of the present invention is that a pH range to be adjusted to transfer it from a dissolved state to a precipitated state, or vice versa, is very narrow, that is, the transition state can take place within a very narrow pH range. In addition, the two states, the dissolved and precipitated states, can take place within both neutral and weakly acidic pH ranges and, therefore, the loss of the enzymatic activity is very small. The following Experiments and Examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed to limit the scope thereof.
