# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO WALL SAFES

## Abstract
A wall safe is concealed behind a utility, preferably a dummy electric utility, such as a power socket. An otherwise conventional lace plate 6 of an electric socket may be secured to conceal an otherwise conventio nal wall safe, or may afford a door to the wall safe. In such latter circumstance, locking mechanism may be operated by the insertion of a key 12 through one of the pin apertures 8 of the dummy socket, to operate the locking mechanism to lock the dummy socket in position, or to release the dummy socket to permit access to the contents of the safe.
