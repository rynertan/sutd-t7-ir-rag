# Magnetic head assembly.

## Abstract
A magnetic head assembly comprises a recording reproducing head 1 and erasing heads 5a, 5b placed at both sides of said recording reproducing head and the mag netic field strength H1 of the erasing gap 6a of one of the erasing heads 5a which move adjacent data produced by a recording reproducing gap is made different from the magnetic field strength H2 of the erasing gap 6b of the other erasing head 5b to control a data area to be erased.
