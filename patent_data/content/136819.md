# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory has a plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ , a plurality of word lines X₀ to X₃ which are arranged so as to intersect the plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ , and a plurality of memory cells MC which are provided at intersection points of the plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ and the plurality of word lines X₀ to X₃ . A row decoder 3 selects at least one of the plurality of word lines X₀ to X₃ , and a column decoder 4 generates a signal for connecting one of the plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ to an input output line I O. A plurality of wiring leads P are formed of a conductor layer different from conductor layers forming the plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ and the plurality of word lines X₀ to X₃ are arranged so as to intersect the plurality of data lines Y₀ to Y₃ . In this way the area of the semiconductor chip 1, on which the memory is formed, may be reduced.
