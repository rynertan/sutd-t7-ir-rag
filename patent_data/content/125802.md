# Multiplexed digital data transmission.

## Abstract
A digital transmission system for transmitting, e.g., tele vision sound has two packet type indicators indicating, e.g., mono stereo transmission. Normally the same packet type indicator is transmitted for a long sequence of packets. To provide synchronising information to enable, e.g., appropri ate timing of the sound signal to the associated video signal, the packet type indicator for a single packet is changed to an indicator which is inappropriate to the packet concerned but is appropriate to another type of packet.
