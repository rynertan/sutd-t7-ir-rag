## Description
The present invention relates to a color burst phase detection system comprising In connection with video disk player systems, playback operations of a CAV Constant Angular Velocity disk will be discussed hereinafter. In CAV disks, composite video signal is recorded in such a manner that a video signal corresponding to one frame is recorded in every one of recording tracks in the case of the disk having concentric recording tracks or in every one circular section of recording track in the case of a disk having a spiral recording track. The relation between the frequency fsc of color subcarrier signal and the frame frequency fF in the NTSC system is determined by the following equation This equation represents that subcarrier signals recorded in a first frame and an adjacent second frame are 180 out of phase. Since the video signal corresponding to one frame is recorded in one of the recording tracks or one circular section of the recording track, the phase difference between the subcarrier signals recorded in two adjacent recording track sections is equal to 180 . In the case of the recording disk having a recording track of spiral form, the continuity of the phase alternation condition of the subcarrier signal is maintained during a normal playback mode in which the recorded video format signal is picked up from an innermost part of the recording track to an outermost portion thereof. However, in addition to this normal playback mode, video disk playback systems are generally constructed to perform the so called SCAN playback mode for performing a fast speed playback operation in which an information reading point of a pickup device is moved in a radial direction across a plurality of the recording track portions. During such a SCAN playback mode, a tracking servo system of the playback system which has a tracking actuator is actuated to place the information reading point of the pickup device at each of the recording track portions on the recording disk in sequence, during the radial movement of the pickup device. However, since the movement of the tracking actuator is limited within a predetermined movable range, it is necessary to stop the tracking operation of the tracking servo system so as to put the position of the tracking actuator back to a center of the movable range. During this period in which the tracking movement of the pickup device is stopped, the light beam for reading information moves across a plurality of recording track portions. Now, the phase relation between the color subcarrier signals of the video signals picked up before and after the crossing of the recording track portions by the pickup means will be discussed. If the number of circular track portions across which the information reading point moves is even, there will be no phase difference between the color subcarrier signals, and the continuity of the video format signal is maintained. On the other hand, if the number of track portions across which the information reading point moves is odd, the phase difference between the color subcarrier signals before and after the movement of the information reading point becomes equal to 180 . Therefore, the continuity of the video format signal is not maintained under this condition. If a playback video signal under this condition is monitored by a video monitor system, the proper hue of the video information is not reproduced when the phase of the color subcarrier signal is inverted. Thus, the reproduction of the color component of the video information becomes unstable. One way to solve this problem is to count the number of recording track portions across which the information reading point moves, and to invert in phase the color video signal depending on whether the number of recording track portions is even or odd. However, it is generally not possible to count the number of recording track portions precisely under the presence of various noises. Further, in the case of a picture information reproduction system using a frame memory, video signals having the same waveform are supplied from the frame memory during a freeze frame playback mode. In that case, a compensation operation is necessary to maintain the continuity of the color subcarrier signal. A color burst phase detection system of the above mentioned kind is known from FR A 2 537 815. This known system also comprises input means for receiving a video signal, reference color subcarrier signal generating means, phase comparing means and detection means for detecting the inversion of burst phase. This system is designed to process a PAL video signal in which the burst phase alternates between 135 and 135 every 1 H period. This known system cannot be used in connection with a NTSC video signal in which burst phase is inverted by 180 every 1 H period, with either a phase inversion of 180 or no phase inversion occurring upon track jump operation. The object of the present invention is to further improve a phase detection system of the kind being used for detecting the phase of a color burst signal component of a video signal and to provide such a system which is able to positively detect whether the burst phase is inverted or not, using a relatively simple circuit construction and without being affected by noise, and which system is suited for use in a video information playback system having a frame memory. In order to satisfy this object the color burst phase detection system is characterized in that said detection means are designed for detecting a level change of said phase comparison signal and producing a burst phase inversion detection signal when said level change of said phase comparison signal exceeds a predetermined reference level, and in that said phase comparing means consist of first and second phase comparators whose axes of phase detection are different from each other and which produce first and second phase comparison signals, respectively and in that said detection means produces said burst phase inversion detection signal when a level change of at least one of said phase comparison signals exceeds said predetermined reference level. Thus, a color burst phase detection system is constructed in such a way that the inversion of burst phase is detected in terms of changes in the phase difference between the reproduced burst signal and the reference burst signal. Such a system can also be used in connection with NTSC video signals. When a level change exceeding a predetermined reference level occurs in either one or both of the output signals of the phase comparators, such a condition is detected as an indication of the inversion of the burst phase of the video signal. In the block diagram of Fig. 1, the video singal reproduction system includes a video demodulator 1 which receives a playback RF Radio Frequency signal and demodulates the same to a video signal. The video signal obtained at the demodulator circuit 1 is then applied to a switching circuit 3 and a chroma phase invertor 2 whose output is connected to a terminal of the switching circuit 3. At the switching circuit 3, one of the video signals from the demodulator circuit 1 and the chroma phase invertor 2 is selected as an output video signal and in turn supplied to an outside circuit. The detection system includes a reference pulse signal oscillator 4 whose oscillation frequency 7.16MHz is twice the frequency 3.58MHz of the subcarrier signal. A reference pulse signal generated by this reference pulse signal oscillator 4 is divided at a dividing circuit 5 by a dividing factor of 1 455, to form a reference horizontal synchronization signal f The output pulse signal of the reference pulse signal oscillator 4 is divided by 2 at a divider 12 to form a reference subcarrier signal fsc of 3.58MHz. This reference subcarrier signal fsc is phase compared, at a phase comparator 13, with a playback video signal. An output signal of the phase comparator 13 is supplied to a burst S H sample and hold circuit 14 in which the phase difference within the burst period is held. An output of the burst S H circuit 14 is then supplied to a differentiation circuit 15 in which the input signal is differentiated, and an output signal of the differentiation circuit 15 is supplied to an input terminal of an OR gate 17 through a window comparator 16. Further, the reference subcarrier signal fsc is supplied to a 90 An inversion detection signal generated by this detection part 30 of the burst phase inversion detection system is supplied to a flip flop circuit 23 as a trigger signal, and an output signal of the flip flop circuit 23 is supplied to the switch circuit 3 as a switch control signal. The operation of the thus constructed color burst phase detection system will be explained hereinafter. The operation of the circuit part including the phase comparator 13 will be explained first. The phase comparison between the reference subcarrier signal fsc and the color burst signal is performed in the phase comparator 13 and the burst S H circuit 14. A change in the level of the phase comparison signal occurs when the chroma phase is inverted after the information reading point has moved across a plurality of track portions for the scanning operation. This level change is detected by the differentiation circuit 15 and transformed to a pulse signal at the window comparator 16 of the next stage. This pulse signal is supplied, as the detection signal of the inversion of the phase alternation condition, to the flip flop circuit 23 through the OR gate 17. The state of the flip flop circuit 23 in changed in response to edges of the pulse signal. If the switch 3 is in a position i before the information reading point crosses the track portions, the switch position changes to a position n after the crossing of tracks, to select the video signal supplied directly from the demodulator 1. With this operation, even if the information reading point crosses the recording tracks, the output video signal will have the subcarrier signal in continuous form. For the phase comparators 13 and 19, general multiplyer type circuits can be used. Since the axes of the phase detection of the phase comparators 13 and 19 are selected to be substantially perpendicular to each other, two phase comparing characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 are obtained. Assume that the phase difference between the burst signal and the reference subcarrier signal fsc is equal to 45 The operation of the circuit part including the phase comparator 19 is performed in the same manner during this period. As illustrated, in Fig. 2, the operation is expressed by a movement from a point A which is coincident with the point a to a point A which is coincident with the point a . This operation of the circuit part including the phase comparator 19 is also illustrated in Fig. 3D through 3F. Under this condition, the detection of the inversion of the phase is detected by both the circuit part including the phase comparator 13 and the circuit part including the phase comparator 19. Thus, the inversion detection signal is derived at an output terminal of the OR gate 17. In addition, the polarity of the differentiator output signal also becomes negative when the change in phase occurs in the reverse direction, i.e. from the point a A to the point a A . However, the phase inversion of 180 Next, the operation of the system when the phase difference between the burst signal and the reference subcarrier signal fsc is equal to 90 Fig. 5 shows the level change in the output signals of the phase comparators 13 and 19 when the phase of the burst signal is inverted or in other words, shifted by 180 In the above embodiment, a pair of phase comparators are utilized for detecting the inversion of the phase of the burst signal. However, the construction of the system is not limited to that of the described embodiment. As an example, a single phase comparator for instance, only the phase comparator 13 may be used for detecting the phase inversion of the color burst signal. In that case, the level change is limited to a range illustated by the solid line of Fig. 5, i.e., the range of the detection of the phase inversion is narrower than that of the previous case in which a pair of phase comparators are utilized. Therefore, it is necessary to set the threshold levels V To prevent this problem, it is conceivable to maintain the phase difference between the burst signal and the reference subcarrier signal always at 45 Therefore, it is desirable to provide a pair of phase comparators 13 and 19 for detecting the inversion of the burst phase. In such a case, as mentioned above, the detection of the inversion of phase can be performed for the whole range of the phase difference between the burst signal and the reference subcarrier signal. Needless to say, with such a construction, it is unnecessary to control the phase relation between the burst signal and the reference subcarrier signal. In other words, it does not become a burden to the time base servo system. In the above embodiment, the color burst phase detection system according to the invention is utilized for maintaining the continuity of chroma signal of the playback video signal, especially from a video disk player system during a scan operation. However, the application of the invention is not limited to this. As an example, the system can be utilized for maintaining the continuity of chroma signal during a multi track jump operation in the above mentioned disk player system. Further, the invention is applicable as a burst phase continuity detection circuit which maintains the continuity of burst phase in a picture reproduction system which uses a frame memory system, such as described in British patent application No. GB A 2 173 632 and German patent application No. DE A 36 11 257 which are based on Japanese patent application number JP A 61 232 786 by the applicant of the present application. In such a picture reproduction system using a frame memory, it is necessary to produce video signals having the same waveform from the video memory frame memory or field memory during a freeze frame playback mode. Therefore, discontinuity of the playback color subcarrier signal occurs every one frame, that is, every two fields in the case of the frame memory. For this reason, a phase compensation process after the output statge of the frame memory is needed for maintaining the continuity of the color subcarrier signal. By employing the color burst phase detection system according to the present invention, the phase inversion of the color subcarrier signal is surely detected with ease, irrespective of the phase of the playback burst signal relative to the reference color subcarrier signal. More specifically, in the picture reproduction system described in the above Japanese patent application, a switch circuit is provided for performing the selection between a playback video signal supplied from a digital to analog converter and the same playback video signal which is supplied through a delay line. The operation of the switch circuit is controlled by an output signal of a burst continuity detection circuit. In this construction, the color burst phase detection system according to the present invention can be used as the burst continuity detection circuit, to controll the operation of the switch circuit. Thus, the continuity of the color subcarrier signal is surely maintained by the system according to the present invention also in the picture reproduction system utilizing a frame memory. It will be appreciated from the foregoing, in the burst phase alternation condition detection system according to the present invention, the color burst signal is directly used to detect the inversion of the burst phase. Therefore, the system is hardly affected by noises and the circuit construction of the system is simplified. Further, there is an advantage that the cost of the system is relatively small.
