# IMPROVED HUMAN T OR B CELL LINES AND A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING IMMUNOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES USING THE SAME

## Abstract
This invention relates to a human T or B cell line carrying at least one Eâ„“a human adenovirus 12 type gene or fragment thereof said cell line being capable of spontaneously producing an immunologically active substance. This inven tion also relates to a process for producing an immunologi cally active substance comprising culturing a human B or T cell line carrying at least one human Ela adenovirus 12 type gene or fragment thereof in a culture medium capable of supporting growth thereof for a period of time effective to attain a spontaneous production of the substance thereof.
