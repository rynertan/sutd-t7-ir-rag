# Touch sensitive screen system.

## Abstract
A position signalling system employs a plurality of touch sensitive screens each of which generate analog signals representing the co ordinates of a position when touched. A selection means is provided to select the screens rapidly in sequence. The analog output signals from the selected screen are fed to analog to digital converters. The sequence of selection proceeds rapidly from screen to screen until a screen is detected that is being touched whereupon the selection sequencing pauses to permit the analog to digital conversion to be carried out and the resulting digital values to be read out to a computer system. Upon readout of the digital values to the computer system, the screen selection sequencing is again permitted to proceed. Means are provided to indicate whether a selected screen that is being touched was touched the last time the same screen was selected.
