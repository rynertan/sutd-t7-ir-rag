# Circuit utilizing Josephson effect.

## Abstract
A circuit, such as a gate, utilizing the Josephson effect is described which is capable of high speed switching and substantially free of resonance produced by Josephson junctions and can be produced in high density integration. The circuit comprises at least three resistors connected in either a star configuration R₁, R₂, R₃ or a triangle configura tion R₁, R₂ R₃ , and three Josephson junctions J₁, J₂, J₃ or J₁, J₂, J₅ each connecting a terminal of said star or triangle configuration with ground. One of said terminals may be used as an output, with a further load reslstor R₂ connected in parallel to the respective Josephson junction, while the other two or more terminals of the star of triangle configura tion are used as inputs.
