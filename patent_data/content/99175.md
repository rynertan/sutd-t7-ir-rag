# SPLIT GATE EFET

## Abstract
Lateral FET structure 102 or 202 is disclosed for bidirectional power switching. A split gate structure 112, 114 is provided to prevent unwanted formation of potential conduction channels in the OFF state of the FET. This enables the gate to be referenced in common to one of the source regions 126 and 128 in the OFF state while still affording high blocking voltage capability. A multicell matrix array is also disclosed.
