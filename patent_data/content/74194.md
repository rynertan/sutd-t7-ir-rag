# Propylene ethylene random copolymer, production process thereof, and film derived therefrom.

## Abstract
A propylene ethylene random copolymer having a fol lowing characteristics a a melting point of 115 C to 140 C b an ethylene content, determined by the C¹³ NMR method, of 6 to 20 mol c a block index, calculated according to the C¹³ NMR method, of 1.1 or less d an MFI, determined at 230 C under a load of 2.16 kg, of 0.5 to 100 g 10 min and e a ratio of the MLMFI, determined at 230 C under a load of 10.0 kg, to the MFI, determined at 230 C under a load of 2.16 kg, of 10 to 16. This random copolymer has a low melting point, and, when a film is molded therefrom, a film having an excellent transparency and moldability, and an excellent impact resistance, especially at a low temperature, and low temperature heatsealability is obtained.
