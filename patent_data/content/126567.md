According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds of the invention wherein 5 6 R and R are both hydrogen, which comprises reacting a bis cyanoguanidine of the formula 1 2 NC.NH.C NH NR X NR .C NH .NH.CN VI 34 with an amine, R R NH, or with two different amines, 34 78 R R NH and R R NH in the form of an acid 1 2 3 addition salt thereof, wherein X, R , R , R 4 7 8 R , R and R have the meanings stated above, at a 0 0 temperature of 100 to 170 C. A suitable amine salt is, for example, the hydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperature, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction should be carried out at a lower temperature over a longer period. The reactants are most conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent such as 2methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, nitrobenzene, sulpholane, isopropanol, n butanol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or water, or a mixture of such solvents may be used. The bis cyanoguanidine of the formula VI, which may be used as the starting material in the above process, may be obtained by reacting the appropriate diamine NH X NH , in the form of an acid addition 2 2 salt, conveniently the dihydrochloride, with sodium dicyananide, in conventional manner. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds of the invention of the formula V, which comprises reacting a diamine of the formula R NH X NHR , in the form of an acid addition salt, with a cyanoguanidine of the formula 34 5 R R ER.C NR NH.CN VII or with a cyanoguanidine of the formula VII and a cyanoguanidine of the formula 78 6 R R NH.C ER NH.CN VIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 wherein A, R , R , R , R , R , R , R and 8R have the meanings stated above, at a temperature of o o 100 to 170 C. A suitable salt of the diamine is, for example, the dihydrochloride. The reactants are heated until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperature, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction should be carried out at lower temperature over a longer period. If a melt can be formed at those temperatures the reactants are conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent. If not, or alternatively, the reactants are heated together in a suitable inert solvent, for example those mentioned above. 1 2 The amine of the formula R NH X NHR which is used as the starting material in the above process, may be obtained by alkylation of the primary diamine NH X NH in conventional manner, for 2 2 example by reacting it with an alkyl halide, or by reductive alkylation wth an aldehyde. The canoguanidines of the formulae VII and 6VIII, wherein R and.R are hydrogen, which are used as the starting materials in the above process, may be obtained by reacting sodium dicyanamide with an 34 78 appropriate amine R R NH or R R NH, in the form of an acid addition salt, conveniently the dihydrochloride, in a suitable inert solvent. The cyanoguanidines of the formulae VII and 5 6VIII wherein R and R are other than hydrogen, which may be used as starting materials in the above process, may be obtained by reacting a dialkyl cyanoimido dithio carbonate, for example dimethyl cyanoimido dithio carbonate, MeS C N.CN, with 34 5 appropriate amines R R NH and R NH which are 78 2 6 preferably the same , or R R NH and R NH 2 The acid addition salts of the invention are obtained by conventional means. The antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention has been measured by the well known minimum inhibitory concentration MIC test. Neat or diluted broth cultures of eight Gram positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, 3 strains ofStaphyloccus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes,Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis , Candida albicans and fourteen Gram negative organisms 4 strains ofEscherichia coli, Salmonella dublin, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inoculated by means of an automatic microtitre inoculator on the surface of nutrient agar plates containing two fold or five fold dilutions of a test compound. After incubation over o night at 37 C., the MIC s of the test compound are read. The geometric mean MIC s for the eight Gram positive organisms and Candida, and 14 Gram negative organisms are then calculated for each test compound. Depending upon its precise chemical structure, a compound of the invention has a mean MIC within the range l l2. ml. in agar against the 8 Gram positive organisms and Candida, and 2Q 250 .Jml. in agar against the 14 Gram negative organisms. The preferred compounds of the invention have an acute LD50 within the accepted limits for compounds used topically, are of low irritancy in the Draize test on intact rabbit skin, are negative in the Ames test for mutagenicity, and are non sensitizing in the Magnusson and Kligman contact sensitivity test in guinea pigs. Because of their antibacterial and antifungal properties the compounds of the invention are useful for many purposes, for example a in medical and veterinary practice for the disinfection of wounds, membranes and or skin tissues and b for the sterilisation of surgical instruments and other medical apparatus and equipment, for example respirators, ventilators, incubators, humidifiers, etc. c for incorporation in toothpastes and mouthwashes for inhibiting the formation of dental plaque, and gingivitis, d for the disinfection of hard surfaces, for example plant and equipment used in the food and drink industries, and floors and walls in the home, factories and hospitals e for the disinfection of textiles, for example blankets, overalls, bed linen, etc. f for the control of microbiological slime in the pulp and paper industries g for the control of micro organisms in swimming pools, cooling water, pasteuriser water, aqueous oil emulsions such as metal working fluids, and other circulating water systems and h and as plant bactericides and fungicides. A drawback to the use of chlorhexidine is that if it contacts white textiles which are subsequently laundered with hypochlorite bleach, dark stains develop.It is an advantage of the preferred compounds of the present invention that such staining is non existent, or minimal. Compounds of the invention also possess useful anti fungal activity against, for example, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and algicidal and anti yeast acitivity. According to a further feature of the invention there are provided antibacterial or antifungal compositions comprising a compound of the formula V wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and X have the meanings stated above, or an acid addition salt thereof, and an inert diluent or carrier therefor. The antibacterial or antifungal compositions of the invention are prepared by conventional means using conventional excipients. They include, for example, aqueous solutions, for example concentrated aqueous solutions, sterile, ready to use aqueous solutions, aqueous dispersions, and emulsions, for example oil in water emulsions, for example aqueous gels, creams, ointments. and pastes. Suitable excipients include, for example, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, gelling agents or thickening agents. According to a further feature of the invention, there is provided a contraceptive method which comprises applying to sperm or the locus of sperm, a spermicidal, sperm immobilising or mucospissic amount of a compound of the invention of the formula V. In one aspect of this method, the compound of the formula V, when applied to vaginal mucus at a suitable concentration, very rapidly increases its viscosity, to the extent that it becomes essentially impenetrable to sperm, and forms a physical barrier to conception in the same way as a rubber sheath or a diaphragm cap. Besides increasing the viscosity of vaginal mucus, when the mucus comes into contact with a bisbiguanide compound of the formula V, other changes occur in its intrinsic properties, such as its morphology, rheology and water uptake and visco elastic properties, which can also effect its penetrability to sperm. The compounds also possess spermicidal or sperm immobilising properties. In vitro, the compounds of the formula V exert a useful contraceptive effect at concentrations down to 3 4 about 10 to 10 8, and a suitable amount to be applied to the human vagina for contraceptive purposes 4 is from 1.Og. to 10 g. The compound of the formula V may be applied to the vagina in conventional manner, for example as a pessary, cream, liquid douche, gel, aerosol foam or impregnated tampon, or in a controlled delivery device of the compound in a polymer matrix. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a compound of the formula V, or a composition thereof, for use as a contraceptive.
