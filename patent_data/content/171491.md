# Forage harvester having supplemental crop disintegrating means.

## Abstract
A high speed rotor 22 in the chute 20 of a forage harvester is used to crack kernels in chopped forage impelled to the rotor. The rotor itself has four or more rows of elongated, spaced apart plates provided with blunt cracking edges 50, 52 , and a deflector 54 , disposed upstream of the rotor, is adjustable for a wide range of positions and diverts the flow of material to allow control over the degree of cracking.
