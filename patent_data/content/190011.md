# Glass fiber strand and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A flat glass fiber strand comprises a multiplicity of glass filaments having a non circular cross sectional shape with the ratio between its maximum and minimum dimensions being between 1.2 1 and 3 1, and which are gathered in such a manner that one dimension of the cross section of each extends in parallel with the same dimension of the other filaments. This flat glass fiber strand is manufactured by discharging molten glass under high pressure from a multiplicity of nozzles which are shaped in the form of bores having non circular cross sectional shape with the ratio between its maximum and minimum dimensions being between 1.5 1 and 6 1 so as to form a multiplicity of filaments of non circular cross sectional shape which are then gathered and wound.
