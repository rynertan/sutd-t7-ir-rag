# Glycoprotein isolated from aloe.

## Abstract
A novel glycoprotein, Alcotin A, is isolated from Aloe, a plant belonging to Liliaceae. The novel glycoprotein has a molecular weight of 1.8 10‚Å¥ and a ratio of protein to sugar of 8 to 2 by weight, gives only single band in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without 2 mercaptoethanol treatment and however two discrete bands in SDs polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 2 mercaptoethanol treatment, has hemagglutinating and cytoagglutinating activity for transformed cells, has mitogenic activity for lymphocytes, cap forming activity for lymphocytes and cultured transformed cells using fluorescence labelled glycoprotein, has binding reactivity with some kind of serum proteins and has activating activity of complement third component. By reason of its biological activity it is useful as an active substance in medicines against several diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, burns and skin diseases.
