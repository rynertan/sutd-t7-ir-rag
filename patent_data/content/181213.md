# Cephalosporium acremonium transformed with an aminoglycoside resistance marker.

## Abstract
The provision of Cephalosporium acremonium resistant to the aminoglycoside G418 allows the use of this aminogly coside as a marker to select aminoglycoside resistant cells of Cephalosporium acremonium from non resistant cells of Cephalosporium acremonium. Aminoglycoside resistance can be imparted by transformation of Cephalosporium acremonium with a suitable vector.
