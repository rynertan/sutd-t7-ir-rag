# Packet load monitoring by trunk controllers.

## Abstract
A trunk controller and processor arrangement for moni toring packet traffic from a high speed trunk 118 through a packet switching network 116 . Within a packet switching system, packets comprising logical addresses and voice data information are communicated through the system by packet switching networks which are interconnected by high speed digital trunks with each of the latter being directly terminated on both ends by trunk controllers 131 . During initial call setup of a particular call, central processors 115 associated with each network in the desired route store the necessary logical to physical address information in the controllers which perform all logical to physical address translations on subsequent packets of the call. Each network comprises stages of switching nodes which are responsive to the physical address associated with a packet by a controller to communicate that packet to a designated subsequent node. Each trunk controller has a traffic monitor ing circuit 179 for measuring the amount of traffic occurring on the attached trunk. The monitoring circuit notifies the associated processor via the network when traffic excursions increase or decrease in excess of a multitude of predeter mined percentages of load. At initialization time and as required during system operation, the processor determines the predetermined percentages of load which are the standards utilized by the trunk controller.
