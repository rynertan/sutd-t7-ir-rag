## Description
DESCRIPTIONTITLE ME THOD FOR PRODUCING POLYSTYRENE RESIN FOAM This invention relates to a method for producing polystyrene resin foams, especially thick foams, by an extrusion forming technique. A thick foam of a polystyrene resin is produced by an extrusion forming technique generally by injecting a volatile blowing agent into a melt of the polystyrene resin in an extruder, heating and mixing them, extruding the molten mixture through a die, and passing the extrudate through a shaping device secured to the end of the die exit to cool and shape it. The molten resin containing the blowing agent is continuously extruded through the die exit, and fills the shaping device while expanding. The extrudate advances toward the exit of the shaping device while making contact with the internal wall of the shaping device so that the thickness of the polystyrene resin foam is restricted by the height of the space of the device, and after leaving the shaping device, the foam is taken up see, for example, U.S. Pat. No.3,954,929 . Such a shaping device is usually made of a metal such as iron. However, since the frictional resistance of the metal to the molten mixture is high, a polystyrene resin foam having a good surface cannot be obtained. To solve this problem, it has been the previous practice to coat the inside surface of the metallic body of the shaping device with a fluorocarbon resin. For a short limited period, such a shaping device can produce polystyrene resin foams with a good surface condition, but because the fluorocarbon resin coating is rapidly consumed by friction, the shaping device must be coated again after a short period of time. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a method of extrusion and foaming which gives a polystyrene resin foam having a good surface condition. The object of this invention is achieved by a method for producing a polystyrene resin foam expanded to a predetermined dimension which comprises extruding a melt of a polystyrene resin containing a blowing agent through a die of an extruder and passing the extrudate through a shaping device located exteriorly of the extruder and secured to the discharge end of the extruder while expanding and solidifying the molten mass so that it fills the shaping device, characterized in that at least a part of that area of the inside surface of the shaping device with which the expanded resin makes contact is formed of a plate of a fluorocarbon resin, said plate being secured to the inside surface of the shaping device by fitting portions, said fitting portions having a sufficient space for absorbing an increase in the volume of the fluorocarbon resin plate at the temperature of extrusion forming, and that the blowing agent is a mixture of 5 to 10 parts by weight of dichlorodifluoromethane and 2 to 4 parts by weight of methyl chloride and or 2 to 4 parts by weight of ethyl chloride and is used in said amounts per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene resin. It is important that in the shaping device secured to the discharge end of the extruder in an apparatus used in performing the method of this invention, that surface of the shaping device which makes contact with the expanded resin is formed of a thick plate of a fluorocarbon resin, and that the fitting portions connected to the metallic body of the shaping device have sufficient room space for absorbing an increase in the volume of the resin plate at the temperature of extrusion forming. When a thick fluorocarbon resin sheet is simply bonded to the inside surface of the shaping device, warpage occurs in the resin sheet due to the difference in thermal expansion between the metal and the resin sheet at the temperature of extrusion, and polystyrene resin foams of good quality cannot be obtained. Moreover, the resin sheet and the metal are frequently delaminated, and the shaping device becomes useless. Since the inside surface of the shaping device used in this invention is made of a fluorocarbon resin plate, it has low frictional resistance, and therefore can give a foam having a smooth and beautiful surface.The shaping device can withstand use for a much longer period of time than similar devices having a surface coating of fluorocarbon. Moreover, because the fluorocarbon resin plate forming the inside surface of the shaping device is not merely bonded to the metallic body of the device, the shaping device in accordance with this invention can be continuously operated stably without causing delamination or warpage due to differences in thermal expansion during extrusion. The conventional shaping device must be externally cooled or heated for temperature adjustment in order to obtain good foams. In contrast, the shaping device in accordance with this invention requires no such external temperature control. The fluorocarbon resin plate in the shaping device in this invention can be easily mounted and detached as desired. A polystyrene resin foam having a good surface condition can be obtained by using the shaping device in accordance with this invention. A polystyrene resin foam having a better surface condition may be obtained by using a resin blowing agent formulation consisting of 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene resin, 5 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 8 parts by weight, of dichlorodifluoromethane, 2 to 4 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 3 parts by weight, of methyl chloride, and or 2 to 4 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 3 parts by weight, of ethyl chloride. The shaping device in accordance with this invention is described specifically below with reference to the accompanying drawings showing one embodiment of an apparatus used in this invention in which the top and bottom portions of the shaping device are made of metal and its sides are made of a fluorocarbon resin, and a fluorocarbon resin plate is secured to the inside surfaces of the top and bottom portions. Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing the shaping device secured to the die exit of an extruder Fig. 2 is a front elevation thereof Fig. 3 is an enlarged partial sectional view showing how a fluorocarbon resin plate is secured to the body of the shaping device Figs 4 and 5 show modifications of the shaping device shown in Fig. 1. In the drawings, the reference numerals designate the members as follows 1, the body of an extruder 2, a screw 3, a die 4, a lip 5, metal constituting the body of a shaping device 6, a fluorocarbon resin plate constituting the top and bottom inside surfaces of the shaping device 7, protrusions 8, a fluorocarbon resin plate constituting the inner side surfaces of the shaping device 9, a foam of a polystyrene resin 10, a pair of take up rolls 11, clamping bolts and 12, depressions. Referring to Figs. 4 and 5 showing other embodi ments of the fluorocarbon resin plate in the shaping device in accordance with this invention, the shaping device consists of a foaming chamber A and shape arranging chamber B. The number of fitting portions which receive the fluorocarbon resin plate provided on the inside surface of the shape arranging chamber B may be one, as shown in Fig. 4. When the fitting portion for the fluorocarbon resin plate is formed at one place one both at the top and bottom parts , such fitting portions are provided in the shape arranging chamber of the shaping device at positions near the foaming chamber, as shown in Fig. 4. When the shaping device in accordance with this invention is operated continuously for a long period of time, that portion of the resin plate which is in the foaming chamber and in the shape arranging chamber at a position near the foaming chamber the portion shown by b inFig. 5 may sometimes undergo wear, leading to the difficulty of providing a good foam. In such a case, it is economically disadvantageous to replace all of the resin plate. To avoid this disadvantage, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the resin plate provided in the shape arranging chamber is divided into two or more portions joined at a bonding portion 13, so that in the event of repair, only the portion b of the resin plate in the shape arranging chamber need be replaced. To secure the fluorocarbon resin plate 6 to the inside surface of the shaping device, it is necessary to provide a space between the fitting portions 7 for connecting the resin plate to the metallic body and the inside surface of the depressions 12 in the resin plates, the space being sufficient for absorbing the increase in the volume of the resin plate at the temperature of extrusion forming. Securing of the fluorocarbon resin plate may, for example, be effected by providing projections or protrusions 7 on the inside surface of the metallic body 5 and recesses or depressions 12 on the resin plate, and fitting the protrusions 7 into the depressions 12.Alternatively, depressions can be provided on the inside surface of the metallic body and protrusions on the resin plate, and the protrusions are fitted into the depression.Or there may also be used a method which comprises providing groove like depressions both on the inside surface of the metallic body and the resin plate, bringing the grooved portions of the two elements face to face, and inserting stops into the groove like depressions. The protrusions on the inside surface of the metallic body or the fluorocarbon resin plate may be provided continuously or discontinuously in various configurations. Usually, each protrusion has the shape of a railroad rail disposed at right angles to the extruding direction of the foam in the shaping device. Other shapes, such as a mushroom like shape or hook like shape, are also possible. The corresponding depressions are usually groove like, but may be of other shapes conforming to the shapes of the protrusions. In securing the fluorocarbon resin plate to the metallic body of the shaping device in this invention in the various modes exemplified hereinabove, it is necessary to provide between the fitting portion and the inside surface of the depressions sufficient room or space for absorbing an increase in the volume of the resin plate at the temperature of extrusion. This is important for preventing delamination or warpage of the resin plate owing to thermal expansion at the time of producing a polystyrene resin foam. The space may be equal to, or greater than, the increase of the volume of the resin plate which may be caused by thermal expansion at the temperature of extrusion molding.The space is filled by the thermal expansion of the resin plate at the time of extrusion molding, or partly filled so as to leave only a small space, and in this state, the resin plate is united integrally with the metallic body. Since the thermal expansion of the metal at the temperature of extrusion molding is much lower than that of the resin plate, the expansion of the metal body can be ignored in actually ditermining the magnitude of the space around the fitting portion. Preferably, the magnitude of the space for absorbing the increase in the volume of the resin plate at the temperature of extrusion forming becomes gradually larger the nearer its location to the discharge end of the shaping device. In the shaping device in this invention, the fluorocarbon resin plate can be designed such that it extends beyong the end portion of the metallic body at the discharge end of the shaping device and its forward end is located close to a pair of take up rolls 10, as shown in Fig. 1. This construction permits production of a polystyrene resin foam having a smooth and beautiful surface and retaining the desired thickness restricted by the shaping device. The fluorocarbon resin plates may also be secured to the inner side surfaces of the shaping device by the provision of grooves or protrusions in the metallic body as in the top and bottom surfaces of the shaping device. Or it is possible to form the top and bottom portions of the shaping device using metal plates and fluorocarbon resin plates secured thereto, and to form its side portions of fluorocarbon resin plates alone and which are secured to the top and bottom portions by means of bolts, etc. The magnitude of the aforesaid space around the fitting portion is specifically explained below with reference to an example of the shaping device used in this invention which is composed of a metallic body of iron and a plate of polytetraluoroethylene secured thereto by the provision of rail like continuous projections in the metallic body and groove like depressions having the corresponding shape in the polytetrafluoroethylene plate.For example, in the production of a foam at an extrusion 0 forming temperature of 110 C. using a polytetrafluoro ethylene plate having a thickness of 20mm, a width of 350 mm and a length of 450 mm in the shaping device, the polytetrafluoroethylene plate is secured to the inside surface of the shaping device by providing five spaces between the projections formed on the metallic body and the depressions provided in the resin plate, each space having a magnitude of about 0.2 mm in the thickness direction, about 1.6 mm a total of 3.2 mm in the widthwise direction on each side of the projection, and about 0.4 mm a total of 0.8 mm in the lengthwise direction on each side of the projection. These spaces substantially disappear as a result of the expansion of the resin plate at the time of extrusion molding, and cause no trouble during the forming operation.The extrusion forming operation can be performed continuously over long periods of time, and polystyrene resin foams of good quality can be obtained without any damage to the shaping device even when the operation is performed continuously for three months. Suitable fluorocarbon resin plates for use in this invention are, for example, a plate of poly tetrafluoroethylene , a plate of a tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymer and a plate of a tetrafluoro ethylene perfluoroalkylvinyl ether copolymer. The thickness of the resin plate is 5 mm to 50 mm, preferably 10 mm to 40 mm. The metal which constitutes the outside wall of the shaping device of this invention includes, for example, iron, brass, stainless steel, and aluminum alloys. In the present invention, it is recommendable to use a mixed volatile blowing agent consisting of 5 to 10 parts by weight of dichlorodifluoromethane and 2 to 4 parts by weight of methyl chloride and or 2 to 4 parts by weight of ethyl chloride per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene resin. This blowing agent formulation, in conjunction with the shaping device in accordance with this invention, gives a polystyrene foam having a smooth, dense surface.Example One hundred parts by weight of polystyrene and 0.1 part by weight of a cell regulating agent composed of an equimolar mixture of monosodium citrate and sodium hydrogen carbonate were fed into an extruder having an inside cylinder diameter of 120 mm. Separately, 12 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene, of a mixed blowing agent consisting of 60 by weight of dichlorodifluoromethane, 20 by weight of methyl chloride and 20 by weight of ethyl chloride was forced into the extruder from a blowing agent injecting opening. The foamable molten gel uniformly kneaded in the extruder was extruded into the outer atmosphere at 1100C from a die orifice having a width of 600 mm and a clearance of 6 mm and attached to the exit of the extruder, and further passed through a shaping device attached to the extruder to form a plate like foam having a cross sectional size of 1200 mm in width and 28 mm in thickness. The upper and lower walls of the shaping device were made of iron, and its both side walls were made of a polytetrafluoroethylene plate and fitted in the upper and lower wall surfaces. Five rail like spaces were provided between projections formed on the iron wall surface and depressions formed on the resin plate, and each space had a magnitude of about 0.2 mm in the thickness direction and 0.4 mm a total of 0.8 mm in the longitudinal direction on each side of the projection. These spaces substantially disappeared as a result of the expansion of the resin plate during the extrusion forming. The extrusion forming operation could be continuously performed smoothly over a long period of time, and good foams were obtained during the three months continuous operation without any damage to both of the foamed plate and the shaping device.Comparative Example The procedure of Example was followed except that instead of using the polytetrafluoroethylene plate, the shaping device was made of iron on all sides, and its inside surface was coated with polytetrafluoroethylene.During the initial stage of the extrusion, foams of good quality were obtained, but after the lapse of three days, the surfaces of the resulting foams gradually became rough. ONe week later, the inside surface of the shaping device had to be again coated with the polytetrafluoroethylene.
