# BUILDING COMPONENT

## Abstract
A building component includes at least two opposing lon gitudinal sheet metal profiles and a cohering plastics material arranged therebetween. Seen in the cross section of the compo nent, each profile is folded inwards along each of its longitudinal edges to at least about 180 , without the edges coming into direct contact against the central portion of the profile, to form two longitudinal flanges. These extend into the plastics material and are firmly anchored therein by their shape.
