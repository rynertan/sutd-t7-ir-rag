## Abstract
Fixed structure 11 of a machine tool has secured thereto an input output unit 115 having a light source 120 illuminating a lens 121 which focuses incident light onto an end of a single flexible light guide 14 at an angle α less than the maximum angle β of internal reflection of the guide 14 . The guide 14 leads to a reading head 12 secured to a slide 10 movable relative to the fixed structure 11 . The incident light emerging from the guide 14 is divided by lenses 25, 26 into two beams focused 25A, 26A onto a grid 13 secured to the fixed structure. The foci 25A, 26A are spaced apart to be out of phase relative to the grid 13 by 90 . Light reflected from the grid 13 returns through the lenses 25, 26 and the guide 14 to the unit 115 where a part of the reflected light is separated from the incident light by virtue of the angle β being greater than the angle α. At the lenses 25, 26 the light is taken through respective filters 25B, 26B of different colours and at the unit 115 there are provided corresponding filters 27B, 28B which separate the reflected light from the respective foci 25A, 26A . Diodes 27, 28 optically coupled to the filters 27B, 28B generate two signals A, B corresponding to the changing levels of the light reflected from the grid as the head passes therealong. The signals A, B are led to a circuit 42 for de tecting which signal A or B is leading thereby to determine the sense of direction of the movement.
