## Description
This application relates to enzymatic synthesis of compounds, particularly low molecular weight peptides containing from 2 to 10 amino acid residues. It relates specifically to the synthesis of alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters. One of such esters, the methyl ester hereinafter APM is commonly known as aspartame, a powerful sweetening agent. It is comprised of L phenylalanyl methyl ester linked through a peptide bond to an L aspartyl residue. APM has been synthesized by many methods, including directly reacting L phenylalanine methyl ester and an N protected aspartic acid anhydride, or by enzymatically joining N protected L aspartic acid and an L phenylalanine methyl ester. A modification of this enzymatic method, which does not require the use of N protected L aspartic acid, is further described by Harada The peptide yields obtainable by the Harada Water miscible or immiscible organic solvents have been used in attempts to improve the yields of synthetic protease reactions. These methods are unsatisfactory because many organic solvents inhibit protease activity and the products must be separated from the solvent by expensive processes. Also, the solvent can be costly, and must be efficiently recycled. Notwithstanding such efforts to secure highly efficient synthesis of contaminant free products, the art has failed to assemble an economical system for enzymatic peptide synthesis. Heretofore, the art has necessarily traded off increased yields in the enzyme catalyzed step against requirements for further processing of the reaction product, including the removal of potentially toxic substances. Accordingly, it is desirable to synthesize peptides in high yield from ordinary microbial cultures or immobilized enzymes, but without the need either to later remove product substituents or otherwise undertake covalent modifications of the product peptide, or to purify the product from organic solvents. One aspect of the present invention provides a process comprising This process can be accomplished by apparatus comprising an immobilized enzyme in fluid communication with a means for electrodialysis, means for recirculating reactant from the electrodialysis means to the immobilized enzyme, and means for recovering product from the electrodialysis means. The electrodialysis means generally comprises a stack of spacer separated alternating anion and cation exchange membranes which are sandwiched between an anode and cathode, and means for applying voltage across the stack of membranes. In one embodiment the enzyme is immobilized within the electrodialysis means on the salt accumulating side of the membranes in order to take advantage of the localized concentration of the charged components of the reactant product system. In another embodiment, which is preferred, the enzyme is immobilized in a reaction chamber outside of the electrodialysis means but in direct or indirect fluid communication therewith. Additionally provided is an electrodialysis apparatus having salt accumulating and depleting cells, means for introducing charged amino acids into the salt accumulating cell, means for removing peptides of 2 10 amino acid residues from the salt depleting cells, a protease immobilized in the salt accumulating cell in the region of highest concentration of charged ions and non electrically conductive means for recycling fluid from the salt accumulating cell into the salt depleting cell. Fig. 1 depicts the preferred embodiment of an apparatus for practicing the inventive method on a continuous basis. A reactor containing an enzyme is placed in fluid communication with a two stage set of electrodialysis devices, the principal function of one of which is to remove accumulated inorganic salt and of the other to remove reactants from the product stream. The apparatus provides means for recycling reactants to the reactor and for product recovery. Fig. 2 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the apparatus. The method of this invention is ordinarily employed to synthesize compounds having a peptide bond, although it can be used to drive any enzymatic reaction having an equilibrium that does not favor product to the desired degree. An enzyme is selected that is capable of catalyzing the synthesis of peptide bonds from carboxyl and amino bearing reactants. Furthermore, the products and reactants must have a sufficiently different net ionic charge that they can be separated by electrodialysis, and in addition either one of the class of products or reactants must bear substantially no net charge. A considerable number of systems have been described which meet these criteria. For example, see M. Bergman The enzyme which is used for coupling the reactants is capable of catalyzing the formation of peptide or amide bonds. It is isolated from microorganisms or vertebrate cells that ordinarily synthesize the enzyme. Desirably, the enzyme is selected for resistance to the elevated substrate reactant and organic solvent concentrations that may be encountered in some peptide synthetic systems, as these are conditions that will aid in driving the forward reaction. Also, the enzyme should act on unblocked substrates, for the reasons discussed above. Suitable enzymes include carboxyl hydrolases, in particular exoproteases, endoproteases, esterases and lactamases, including serine alkaline proteinases such as alpha chymotrypsin, trypsin and subtilisin thiol proteinases such as papain carboxyl acidic proteinases, e.g. pepsin and metalloproteinases neutral proteinase such as thermolysin, prolisin, tacynase N or dispase. Enzymes from the EC 3.4.21, 3.4.22, 3.4.23 and 3.4.24 classifications of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry are useful. The enzymes described in Harada The enzyme need not be purified before use, i.e., it may be present in living or killed cells, or it may be cell free and purified to the desired degree. The cells or enzyme composition should be free of interfering enzymes, i.e., undesired esterases, proteases or the like that might modify the starting materials or the synthetic product in undesired ways. For example, the synthetic enzyme used in APM synthesis should be free of esterase that is capable of hydrolyzing L phenylalanine methyl ester. The use of mixtures of enzymes which catalyze desirable sequential reactions are within the scope herein. The products of all initial synthetic steps prior to the last step in which final product is synthesized preferably will bear a net ionic charge so as to avoid coelectrodialysis of intermediates with the final product. Obviously, the use of neutral reactants and a charged final product is satisfactory. Generally the enzyme catalyzed synthetic reaction is conducted in a reaction chamber separate from the product separation function. In these embodiments the most economical approach is to leave the enzyme in the microbial cells which produce it. The cells preferably are killed before use rather than being used as a living culture. The hollow fiber reactor system described in J. Kan The preferred apparatus of this invention is shown in Fig. 1. Conduit Each of the electrodialysis devices Another suitable apparatus for the enzymatic synthesis and recovery of APM is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of two principal elements, an electrodialysis device generally shown at The electrodialysis device is an Ionics Medimat 110 brand electrodialysis apparatus modified to carry out separation of APM from sodium aspartate SA and phenylalanine methyl ester PME HCl. The membrane stacking arrangement used with the electrodialysis apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. It is an alternating stack of anion permeable and cation permeable membranes in which the cation permeable face of the stack is oriented toward the anode. It contains a number of cells spaces bound by ion exchange membranes . The number of cells is not critical and can be considerably larger than as shown in the Figs. Further, it is not critical to use alternating anion and cation exchange membranes. The cation permeable membrane is an Ionics CZL386, a sulfonate group substituted membrane reinforced with a copolymer of vinyl chloride and acrylonitrile. This membrane CZL has a molecular weight cut off of about 200 300, i.e., which readily passes substances with molecular weights below 200 300 MW. The anion permeable membrane, Ionics QZL386, is similar but substituted with quatenary ammonium groups. The cation transfer membrane will permit the transfer of cations while excluding anions, and vice versa in the case of the anion transfer membrane. Reservoirs of dilute acid 0.1M H₂SO₄ and dilute base NaOH 0.1 N , respectively designated The enzyme reactor When current flows between the electrodes cation exchange membranes will allow cations to migrate through the membranes under the influence of the electric field while anions that migrate in the opposite direction will be largely prevented from crossing the membrane. On the other hand, anion exchange membranes will allow anions to cross while largely preventing cations from crossing. When an alternating array of cation exchange and anion exchange membranes is used every other compartment bounded by these membranes will accumulate ions. The solution in the remaining compartments will be depleted of ions the salt depleting chambers or cells but will contain uncharged substances such as APM. Generally, and specifically in the case of APM, the reactor effluent to be treated is passed through the salt depleting compartment, and a solution in which the charged species will accumulate is passed through the others, termed salt accumulating . Generally, the solutions passed directly between the electrodes and the entire stack of cells chambers In contemplated operation the device was equilibrated with a dilute solution of SA and PME before use. During steady state operation the product stream exiting the enzyme reactor Electrodes An additional advantage from the use of this device, is that the product solution is concentrated by electro osmosis. If the desired product is concentrated to a point near saturation it may be precipitated in a step downstream from the electrodialysis cell, e.g., by cooling the solution during passage through a heat exchanger not shown , and then separation of the precipitate by conventional methods, e.g., by recovery from a continuous centrifuge not shown . An alternative, but less preferred embodiment would have the enzyme located in direct contact with the product solution rather than being separated from the solution by a hollow fiber or other dialysis membrane as shown at In a further embodiment the enzyme is adsorbed or covalently crosslinked to, or is otherwise immobilized onto the electrodialysis membranes within the electrodialysis cell. For example, the surfaces of the membranes bounding the salt accumulating solution electrodialysis chamber While one of the advantages of this invention is the capability of eliminating the need to supply immiscible or miscible organic solvents in the product stream, by no means does the practice of the invention exclude the use of such solvents so long as they are compatible with the enzyme and ion exchange membranes, their subsequent removal is economically viable and, in the case of products intended for administration to animals or humans, they are nontoxic.
