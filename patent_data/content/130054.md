# Novel Fructosyltransferase, process for the preparation of Fructosyl disaccharides, and a novel halosucrose.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a fructoside, especially a fruc tosyl disaccharide, comprises reacting a fructosyl saccharide such as sucrose or raffinose with an alcohol or aldose in the presence of a fructosyl transferase, especially one derived from B. subtilis BCIB 11811, 11872 or 11873. In particular, aldose is a compound of the formula
