# Interprocessor connection system.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an interprocessor connection system for data and information exchange, the interconnec tion being achieved by means of a sequential multiple access ring memory duely timed by a clock signal to which ring memory all the processors are connected through the same number of interfaces, said interfaces being equipped with devices for sequential storage which devices are essential parts of said sequential ring memory.
