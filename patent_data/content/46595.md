It is apparent from the above general Formula I that the compounds wherein the symbol X is represented by oxygen are acylated furanyl acrylates and that the compounds are acylated thienyl acrylates when X is represented by sulfur each group being represented by the following general Formulae II and III, respectively EMI3.1 Formula IIEMI3.2 Formula III wherein Z, A, B and Y are as hereinabove defined. In general, the compounds of this invention are prepared by standard techniques analogously known in the art wherein either a furanyl acrylate or a thienyl acrylate is subjected to an acylation reaction to produce a 5 acylated 2 furanyl acrylate or a 5 acylated 2 thienyl acrylate which, when subjected to facultative finishing steps produce the desired compounds as represented by the structures of Formulae I, II and III. More specifically, the compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a series of chemical reactions which is initiated with a Friedel Crafts acylation wherein a furanyl acrylate or a thienyl acrylate is reacted with a trifluoroacetyl mixed anhydride in the presence of catalytic quantities of perchloric acid to produce an ester of an appropriate 3 5 acyl 2 furanyl 2 propenoate or an ester of an appropriate 3 5 acyl 2 thienyl 2 propenoate, which esters may then be sequentially subjected to a basichy drolysis and acidification to produce the corresponding acid i.e., Y represents OH , which acids may be transformed to the desired amides i.e., when Y is NR1R1 or esters i.e., when Y is OR1 or thioesters i.e., when Y is SR1 orEMI4.1 by standard techniques well known for such transformations. In essence, the initial Friedel Crafts reaction may be represented by the following schematic representationEMI4.2 wherein the symbols Z, X, A and B are as herein defined. In effecting this acylation reaction, a trifluoroacetyl mixed anhydride is formed, in situ, by admixing the appropriate saturated straight or branched chain monocarboxylic acid or unsaturated mono , di , tri or tetraolefinic straight or branched chain monocarboxylic acids IV with trifluoroacetic anhydride V at room temperature. The mixed anhydride is then reacted with the acrylate VIII in the presence of catalytic quantities of perchloric acid. The Friedel Crafts acylation is conducted by admixing molar equivalent quantities of the reactants at temperatures of about 400C to about room temperature in the presence of catalytic quantities up to 0.1 molar of perchloric acid, preferably in the form of a 70 aqueous solution.The reaction may be conducted with or without a non reactive solvent standard for this reaction e.g., ether, methylene chloride, benzene, nitrobenzene or other known Friedel Crafts solvents . The soobtained alkyl 3 5 acyl 2 furanyl 2 .propenoates or 3 15 acyl 2 thienyll 2 propenoates are then converted to their free acids for further conversion to their salts, esters, amides and thioesters according to techniques well known in the art. Alternatively, the compounds of Formula III also may be prepared by a series of chemical reactions which is initiated with a Friedel Crafts acylation procedure. This acylation utilizes standard procedures wherein the appropriate acid, in the form of its acid chloride derivative, is reacted with an alkyl 3 2 thienyl acrylate, said acylation being done in the presence of a catalyst according to the following schematic representation EMI5.1 In effecting the foregoing, the appropriate acid IV is first converted to its acid chloride by reaction of the acid with thionyl chloride according to standard procedures.The acid chloride is then subjected to the FriedelCrafts reaction with the ethyl ester of thienyl acrylate wherein equimolar amounts of the reactants are stirred at temperatures of about 200C to about room temperature for about 1 2 to 4 hours and then heated to reflux until the reaction is complete, usually about 5 to 20 minutes. The reaction takes place in the presence of such standardFriedel Crafts catalysts as, for example, ferric chloride and stannic chloride. Here too, the acylation may optionally take place in the presence of a non reactive solvent usually utilized for such reactions. Conversion of the so obtained alkyl 3 5 acyl 2 thienyl acrylate XII to the desired acid by basic hydrolysis and neutralization techniques, which acid may then be transformed to the desired amides, esters or thioesters by standard techniques. Exemplary of the facultative finishing steps for obtention of the desired amides, esters and thioesters are a reaction of the acid chloride forms of compound IX with N acetylcysteamine or other thiols i.e., HSR1 or ROH according to standard techniques will produce the desired thioesters, b reaction of the said chloride form of compound IX with strong ammonium hydroxide in a nonreactive solvent e.g., tetrahydrofuran will give the corresponding amide, c reaction of compounds IX and XII with the appropriate amine e.g., diethylamine according to standard techniques will give the desired alkenamide, and d esterification of the acid forms of compound VIII with the appropriate alcohol will yield the desired esters.
