# FUEL CONDITIONING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for operating an internal combustion engine that substantially improves the fuel efficiency by utilizing heat normally discharged to the ambient to condition and prepare the fuel mixture prior to entry into the combustion chambers. The apparatus com prises a fuel vaporizer, a fuel mixture heater and a mixture homogenizer located in a fuel mixture flow path intermediate the vaporizer and the heater. The fuel vaporizer includes structure defining an inner heat exchange chamber which receives air and entrained fuel discharged by a fuel introduc ing device such as a carburetor. The fuel mixture is heated and at least partially vaporized by engine waste heat derived from the engine cooling system or alternately the engine exhaust system. To facilitate the transfer of heat to the fuel mixture, a pair of heat exchange members are disposed in the chamber and include a supply tube defining a flow path for fluid carrying engine waste heat and a plurality of bristle like heat exchange surfaces radiating outwardly from the supply tube. The bristle like surfaces are located in heat exchange relation with the fuel mixture in the vaporizing chamber and transfer heat from the heat exchange fluid to the fuel mixture as the fuel mixture passes through the vaporizer.
