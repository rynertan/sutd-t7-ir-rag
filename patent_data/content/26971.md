# Lung ventilator.

## Abstract
A lung ventilator which changes over automatically to provide either ventilation of to allow for natural breathing has an oxygen inlet 1 connected through a pressure re gulator 2 and a flow regulator 4 to a reservoir 7 . A se condary supply to the reservoir 7 takes place through a NOT unit 10 . Oxygen from the reservoir 7 is supplied to a face mask connection 29 either through a demand val ve 34 or through a second flow regulator 17 and a spool valve 26 . The spool valve 26 is controlled by a pneumatic timing system 20 25 and the oxygen from the reservoir 7 either flows intermittently through the spool valve 26 which is opened and closed by the timing sys tem 20 25 to provide ventilation or, it is supplied through the demand valve 34 . Changeover from one supply to the other and back again is controlled in dependence upon the pressure in the reservoir 7 . When there is a demand supply through the valve 34 , this is greater than the gas supply through the regulator 4 and in consequence when the pressure in the reservoir 7 falls to a predetermined minimum valve, the NOT unit 10 opens to provide an in creased oxygen flow to the reservoir 7 .
