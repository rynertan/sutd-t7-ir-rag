## Description
The present invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA technology, to means and methods utilizing such technology in the preparation of recombinant gamma interferons having enhanced stability, to their production and to the various products of such production and their uses. This application is related to GB 2107718. The publications and other materials used herein to illuminate the background of the invention and in particular cases to provide additional details respecting its practice are for convenience numerically referenced in the following text and respectively grouped in the appended bibliography. Human interferons can be classified in three groups on the basis of different antigenicity and biological and biochemical properties. The first group comprises a family of leukocyte interferons which are normally produced mainly by constituent cells of human blood upon viral induction. These have been microbially produced and found to be biologically active 1,2,3 . Their biological properties have prompted their use in the clinic as therapeutic agents for the treatment of viral infections and malignant conditions 4 . In the second group is human fibroblast interferon, normally produced by fibroblasts upon viral induction, which has likewise been microbially produced and found to exhibit a wide range of biological activities 5 . Clinical trials also indicate its potential therapeutical value. The leukocyte and fibroblast interferons exhibit very clear similarities in their biological properties despite the fact that the degree of homology at the amino acid level is relatively low. Both groups of interferons contain from about 165 to about 166 amino acids and are acid stable proteins. Human gamma interferon also variously referred to as immune interferon, γ interferon, IIF or IFN γ exhibits the antiviral and anti proliferative properties characteristic of the interferons but, in contrast to leukocyte and fibroblast interferons, is pH 2 labile. Prior to the production of gamma interferons via recombinant DNA technology, it had been produced mainly upon mitogenic induction of lymphocytes. Human gamma interferon is clearly antigenically distinct from the leukocyte and fibroblast interferons. Gray, Goeddel and co workers were the first to report expression of a recombinant gamma interferon 6 , which has proven to exhibit the characteristic properties of human gamma interferon, i.e., anti viral and anti proliferative activity coupled with pH 2 lability. The recombinant gamma interferon of Gray and Goeddel, as produced in For example, Alton In our hands, recombinant gamma interferons whose N terminal amino acid sequence comprises cysteine residues have proven problematic from the standpoint of oligomerization which may involve participation of sulfhydryl groups of one or more of the cysteine residues in disulfide bond formation. Our inability to completely reduce these putative disulfide linkages suggests the problem may be more complex, possibly also involving reaction through the hydroxyl function of the cysteine bounded tyrosine residue. These recombinant interferons have proven somewhat unstable and, whether resulting from such instability or otherwise, have proven of less than optimal utility. The present invention provides gamma interferon polypeptides modified at the N terminal and or C terminal regions with respect to the sequence disclosed in Gray et al, supra, by in one aspect providing a gamma interferon polypeptide consisting of amino acid sequence, extending from the N terminus In another aspect the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising such gamma interferon polypeptides. Z may be part of the sequence The invention also provides corresponding expression vectors capable of producing such interferon polypeptides, and transformants useful in the production through recombinant DNA technology of the interferon polypeptides of the invention. Preferred embodiments of the invention exhibit greatly improved stability and activity relative to those previously described in the literature. The manner in which these and other objects of the invention are attained will be apparent from the detailed description which follows and from the accompanying drawings, in which We have learned that native human gamma interferon i.e., that arising from mitogen induction of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and subsequent purification is a polypeptide which lacks the CYS TYR CYS N terminus assigned by Gray Appropriate alteration of cDNA for CYS TYR CYS containing recombinant human gamma interferon permitted the direct expression in In our hands, the CYS TYR CYS containing recombinant gamma interferon earlier reported by Gray and co workers benefited from formulation with human serum albumin in aid of stabilization. The presence of serum albumin in the final lyophilized product, however, requires that certain quality control steps be performed in advance of lyophilization rather than upon finished product. In the case of the novel recombinant gamma interferon of present invention, on the other hand, the material in lyophilized form has proven to be sufficiently stable without the inclusion of serum albumin. Where desired, however, the gamma interferons of the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable levels of human serum albumin. Beyond the foregoing, the CYS TYR CYS lacking recombinant human gamma interferons of the invention appear in cytopathic effect inhibition testing to be markedly more active as antiviral agents than their CYS TYR CYS containing analogs. The activity is conventionally assayed in microtiter plates by inhibition of the cytopathic effect CPE of encephalomyocarditis virus on human lung carcinoma cells A549. See 12 . The recombinant gamma interferons of the invention include all those comprising amino acids 1 to about 126 of the full sequence provided above. Gamma interferons variously truncated at the carboxy terminal end relative to the full sequence continue to exhibit the characteristic properties of human gamma interferon, albeit at diminished levels in some cases, so long as amino acids 1 to about 126 are present. Indeed, experiments with the CYS TYR CYS containing analog reported at 7 showed that extraneous sequences could be substituted for the amino acid sequence following amino acid 132 by the present numbering system without loss of activity. See, e.g., 8 . Preliminary evidence in our hands supports the hypothesis that while amino acids 1 to about 126 THR are relatively tightly bound in a three dimensional configuration we associate with activity, remaining amino acids of the full sequence are by comparison less confined and relatively sensitive to proteolysis. Trypsin digestion under limiting conditions removes various portions of the sequence downstream from amino acid 126, but not upstream therefrom. Native gamma interferon moieties in our hands include molecules variously extending through amino acids 127, 128, 129, 130, 132 and 134. We have seen fully active recombinant gamma interferon whose amino acid sequence following methionine consisted variously of amino acids beyond MET 1 to about 139 and 1 to about 131, the latter obtained by limited digestion of recombinant gamma interferon with trypsin followed by sequence confirmation. Similar trypsin digested fragments variously ending at about amino acids beyond MET 128 and 129 retained activity, albeit substantially diminished. On the other hand, material having 125 amino acids in addition to N terminal methionine , the threonine at position 126 and following amino acids having been digested away, exhibited less than 1 the activity of undigested material in CPE inhibition assay. Recombinant derived gamma interferon, in addition to its bearing an initial methionine when produced in hosts where the methionine is not intracellularly cleaved, appears to exhibit a major species having 139 amino acids based on the numbering system of Figure 1 and a minor species having 143 amino acids. The composition of the two species contains greater than about 95 percent, most preferably greater than about 97 percent of the species having 139 amino acids. Trypsin digestion under limiting conditions likewise removes various portions of the sequence downstream from about amino acid 126. Recombinant gamma interferon in our hands following such limiting trypsin digestion include species variously extending through amino acids 125, 126 with an initial methionine 129, 131 and 134. These species have retained activity, albeit substantially diminished, in the zone extending from about amino acid 125 to about 129. Species having at least about 129 amino acids, and especially at least about 131 amino acids, i.e., species having from about 129 to 143 amino acids are essentially functionally fully active. By reference to recombinant gamma interferon herein we intend a polypeptide whether or not glycosylated by the cell in which it is produced expressed in a transformant cell from a replicable expression vehicle arising from recombinant DNA technology, the polypeptide exhibiting in greater or less degree the antiviral and antiproliferative activity in humans and pH 2 labile properties characteristic of native human gamma interferon. The recombinant gamma interferons as claimed are believed to form dimers , defined for the purpose of this disclosure as a combination of two such polypeptides which polypeptides may have the same or a different number of amino acids . The nature of the chemical combining mechanism is not fully understood, but is believed to be other than covalent bonding. This combination into dimers appears to occur spontaneously and is believed to be inevitable in the systems described herein. Thus, when the recombinant gamma interferons of the present invention are administered, they will usually be in the dimerized form. Furthermore, subject to the terms of the appended claims, it is to be understood that here, similarly to the disclosures in the literature relating to differently characterized recombinant gamma interferons 8, 9 , amino acid substitutions or additions, particularly single amino acid substitutions and addition or substitution of groups of amino acids upstream or downstream from about amino acid 126 in the recombinant gamma interferons disclosed herein are possible without destroying the interferon activity of the polypeptides from which such modifications are derived. It is believed that it will be obvious to those skilled in the art to make such substitutions or additions without departing from the scope of the present invention claimed. Again, the recombinant gamma interferons of the present invention as claimed include species having modifications and allelic variations of the full sequence see Figure 1 which exhibit biological activity equivalent to or greater than that of the full sequence. Characteristically, purified recombinant gamma interferons will be essentially free of other proteins of human origin, and are so to be distinguished from the native human gamma interferon compositions heretofore available. The invention includes recombinant gamma interferon compositions which prior to formulation are greater than about 95 percent pure, preferably more than about 98 percent pure, which compositions are for that reason likewise distinct from native gamma interferons heretofore available. Embodiments of the invention as claimed in which the N terminal amino acid residue is methionyl are likewise distinct from gamma interferons produced within the human body, and appear also for that reason to be distinct, beyond their deletion of CYS TYR CYS , from those whose sequence is reported by Gray The replicable expression vehicles referred to herein are double stranded DNA moieties, preferably plasmids, comprising an origin of replication, a promoter or promoter operator, a sequence encoding a ribosome binding site, a codon for a translation start signal, and in proper reading phase therewith a gene encoding the recombinant gamma interferon of interest, followed by codon s for a translation stop. At the present stage the general techniques and lexicography of recombinant DNA technology are well understood to the art skilled, who are referred in any event to 11 for background information pertinent to the practice of the present invention, mutatis mutandis, in all its embodiments and legally cognizable equivalents. Recombinant DNA clones containing gamma interferon cDNA sequences were prepared as described in 6 and in the aforementioned GB 2107718 with messenger RNA from induced human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The DNA sequence of clone p67 is shown in Figure 1. A 5 untranslated region is followed by 69 nucleotides encoding a precursor or signal peptide of 23 amino acids, 429 nucleotides coding for a mature interferon polypeptide of 143 amino acids, and 587 nucleotides of 3 untranslated sequence. To express high levels of recombinant IFN γ in An Expression of a gene encoding both the signal peptide and gamma interferon, as indicated in Figure 1, was effected in COS 7 cells 16 in the presence of radioactively labeled cysteine and methionine, confirming the production from the gene of mature gamma interferon whose N terminal amino acids are as indicated in Figure 1 unlike the case involving Confluent monolayers of COS 7 cells in 60 mm petri dishes were transfected in duplicate with DNA using the modified DEAE dextran procedure. Three days after DNA addition, the media was removed. Each set of plates received 2 mls DMEM supplemented with either 100 µCi S³⁵ methionine or S³⁵ cysteine. After 16 hours incubation in the presence of the radiolabeled amino acid, the media was removed and 500 µl immunoprecipitated using an anti gamma interferon monoclonal antibody or an anti HBsAg monoclonal antibody as the first antibody and a rabbit anti mouse IgG antibody Cappell Inc. as the second antibody. Reaction with the antibody and the subsequent binding to Staphlycoccus A cells Calbiochem are as described by Berman, P. Plasmids used in this study were pSVgamma69 11 pDL RI 19 , a hepatitis B virus surface antigen expression vector upon which pSVgamma69 was based and pDL Rlgamma Sau, a polycistronic plasmid containing the 830 bp SAU3a fragment of pSVgamma69 11 spanning the entire gamma interferon encoding sequences inserted into the EcoRI site of pDL RI. The latter plasmid produces a transcript containing both the gamma interferon and the HBsAg coding regions. Comparison of S³⁵ Cysteine and S³⁵ Methionine labeled proteins which react with either anti gamma interferon A or anti HBsAg B antibodies showed that no material migrating at either the glycosylated 29,000 MW or monoglycosylated position 18,000 MW was specifically immunoprecipitated from S³⁵ Cys labeled pDL RI gamma Sau transfected cells using anti gamma interferon antibody, in contrast to the S³⁵ met labeled cells which showed the immunoprecipitation of interferon gamma. The production of recombinant Human Interferon Gamma rIFN γ using A stock culture is prepared in sterile baffled culture flasks containing 150 to 500 mL of a sterile medium having the following composition. The inoculum is prepared in the medium previously described L.B. Broth in either shaker flasks or small fermenters. After incubation at about 37 C for approximately 8 hours, the inoculum is transferred to a fermenter. The volume of the inoculum is between 2 to 10 percent of the volume of the fermentation. Recombinant Interferon Gamma production is carried out in fermenters with working volume of about 10 to 1000 liters. The fermentation medium is composed of The supernatant from part a is adsorbed to a silica based adsorbant which is washed to remove impurities with appropriate salt solutions in the pH range of 6 to 9. Recombinant gamma interferon is eluted using a solution containing 0.5 1.0 M tetramethyl ammonium chloride. All operations in this step are performed in the pH range of 7 to 9. The eluent from part b is dialysed and adsorbed to an anion exchange chromatography medium which is then washed to remove impurities. Recombinant gamma interferon is eluted with a gradient of increasing salt. Typical anion exchange resins applicable for this step include carboxymethyl cellulose and sulphoethyl cellulose. All operations are performed in the pH range of between 7 and 9. The eluent from part c is adsorbed to a medium of calcium phosphate which is then washed to remove impurities. The recombinant gamma interferon is eluted by increasing the salt concentration in a gradient of increasing phosphate concentration. All operations in this step are performed in the pH range of between 7 and 9. The eluent from part d is dialysed and adsorbed to an anion exchange chromatography medium which is then washed to remove impurities. The recombinant gamma interferon is eluted from the anion exchange medium with a gradient of increasing salt concentration. Typical anion exchange chromatography media are carboxymethyl cellulose and sulphoethyl cellulose. All operations in this step are performed in the pH range of between 7 and 9. The eluent from part e is applied to a gel permeation medium and the column is developed with a salt containing medium. The appropriate recombinant gamma interferon containing fractions are pooled to produce the bulk drug substance. All operations in this step are performed in the pH range of between 7 and 9. To determine the c terminal sequence samples were dialyzed into 70 percent formic acid, cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the resulting peptides separated on an Altex Ultrasphere C8 reverse phase HPLC column. Peaks were collected and analyzed by amino acid and sequence analysis. One C terminal peptide was found leu phe arg gly arg residues 135 139, Figure 1 . In some cases another additional peptide was detected leu phe arg gly arg arg ala ser gln residues 135 143, Figure 1 . To determine the ratio of these two peptides, known amounts by amino acid analysis were loaded onto the reverse phase HPLC column and the respective peak heights determined. Each of three production lots contained less than about two percent of the long peptide 135 143, Figure 1 , the balance being the 5 mer. This data is consistent with Recombinant gamma interferon made in accordance with the foregoing is preferably formulated for parenteral administration according to the following Table. The interferons of the invention may be employed in medically appropriate dosage ranges, e.g., 1.0 mg M² of body surface area. To establish the activity of various gamma interferons differing in their carboxy termini gamma interferon prepared as describd in the A sample of recombinant gamma interferon r HuIFN gamma 6.5 mg , prepared as described herein, was desalted over a small Sephadex G 25 molecular sieving column PD 10, Pharmacia into 0.10 M Ammonium Bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5 to a final protein concentration of 2.1 mg ml. A dilute trypsin solution Worthington TPCK trypsin, 10 µg ml in 0.001 Fractionation of each time point sample into its respective components was performed on a Waters HPLC system using a BioRad Biogel HPHT Column. The time point aliquot in bicarbonate buffer was loaded directly by manual injection to the column at the time of sampling. The column was equilibrated in 0.01 M sodium phospate pH 8.0, 30 µM calcium chloride and protein was eluted from the column utilizing a linear gradient of the equilibration buffer and 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 0.6 µM calcium chloride. Protein peaks as determined by absorbance at 214 nm and 280 nm were preparatively collected and stored covered at 4 C until analyzed. Typical analyses for selected peaks included After cleavage, samples are taken to dryness by rotary evaporation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of water and redried. Prior to fractionation by HPLC, samples were redissolved in 50 formic acid to a protein concentration of approximately 1 mg ml. Peptides were fractionated using a Waters HPLC system employing an Altex Ultrasphere Octyl column and a trifluoroacetic acid water trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile linear elution gradient. Wherever possible, peptides were identified by amino acid analysis. Table I lists comparative data for shortened forms of r HUIFN γ It will be appreciated that gamma interferons of any length within the range 126aa 143aa excluding N terminal methionine will be expressed from appropriately tailored genes. Thus, for example, the gene depicted in Figure 1 contains a Fnu4H restriction site at After 24 hours of incubation, challenge all wells, except cell controls, with 50 microliters of encephalomyocarditis virus at a multiplicity of infection which results in 100 cytopathic effect in 24 hours after infection. Cover trays with lids and incubate at 37 C for 24 hours. Pour off fluid from all wells and stain 5 15 minutes with 0.5 crystal violet. Viability of cells is determined by observation of stained cells. Titer of a sample is the reciprocal of the dilution where 50 viable cells remain. The activity of all samples is normalized by the Reference Units Conversion Factor which is calculated from Using the A549 EMCV bioassay systems standardized with IFN gamma reference material provided by the NIH, the specific antiviral activity of recombinant human IFN gamma is approximately three times higher than the activity of the modified rIFN gamma molecule with three additional amino acids cys tyr cys at the N terminus. Based again on the above mentioned measure of bioactivity A549 EMCV , formulated and vialed rIFN gamma continues to be stable no loss of biological activity three months after production stored at 4 C . The test cells suspended in the culture medium were seeded into plastic tissue culture plates at a concentration of 5 10³ cells 0.5 ml well. Various amounts of interferon dissolved in the corresponding culture medium 0.5 ml were added subsequently day 0 . Cultivation was carried out at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 percent CO₂ and 95 percent air. On day 6 the culture media were removed and the cells in suspension culture were directly suspended in Isoton II Coulter Electronics Inc. for cell counting in a Coulter counter. The cells forming a sheet in plastic vessels were pre treated with 0.05 percent trypsin 0.02 percent EDTA to prepared single cell suspension in Isoton II Coulter Electronics Inc. . Antiproliferative activity of interferon was expressed as the antiviral units required to produce 50 percent reduction of cell number IC As shown in the table, the antiproliferation activity of rIFN gamma varied markedly depending on the human cell species. In this case KATO III, siglet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach, was highly sensitive, the cell line showing the IC₅₀ of 1.2 IU ml, while Daudi cells, Burkitt s lymphoma, which were highly sensitive to type II interferon HuIFN alpha, HuIFN beta , were insensitive to type II interferon including rIFN gamma. Lung adenocarcinoma PC 8, PC 12 was insensitive to all interferon species tested. The anticellular spectrum between rIFN gamma and CTC rIFN gamma was almost the same and it was generally apparent that the antiproliferative efficacy of rIFN gamma was superior to that of CTC rIFN gamma. In the case of comparison between four interferons, the highest efficacy was obtained from rIFN gamma except for Daudi cells. 1 10⁶ IU vial of lyophilized rIFN gamma prepared in accordance with the While the invention has been exemplified by reference to the preferred embodiments in which expression is effected in
