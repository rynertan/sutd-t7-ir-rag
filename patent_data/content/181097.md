# Programmable enable buffer.

## Abstract
A circuit constructed in accordance with this invention is described which includes a programable chip enable output enable buffer 11 X . The chip enable output enable buffer may be programmed to provide a chip enable function in response to a logical 1 or logical 0 chip enable input signal, and output enable function in response to a logical 1 or logical 0 output enable input signal, or an active powered chip regardless of the provided input signal. The chip enable output enable buffer is programmed by program ming selected transistors in the buffer. A P channel transistor 40, 60 is programmed by causing its source to be connected to its drain. An N channel transistor 50, 60 is programmed by causing its source and drain to be discon nected. In one embodiment, the programming is accom plished in the preferred embodiment by either a diffusion process or an ion implantation process.
