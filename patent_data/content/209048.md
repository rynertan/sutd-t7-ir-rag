# Process and apparatus for cleaning nuclear reactor cooling water.

## Abstract
A process and an apparatus for cleaning nuclear reactor cooling water with cation exchange resin whose ion exchang ing groups have a bonding energy of not more than 300 KJ mole are disclosed, whereby the radiation exposure of opera tors in an atomic power plant can be considerably reduced, and the waste ion exchange resin can be readily disposed.
