# NOVEL GRAFT POLYACRYLAMIDE COPOLYMERS AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND USE

## Abstract
Novel graft polyacrylamide copolymers are provided by reaction of high molecular weight polyacrylamide with an alkyl epoxide compound such as glycidyldimethylamine or glycidyltrimethylammonium salt to form a grafted polymeric unit to form the respective polymeric units of acrylamido 2 hydroxylpropyltrimethylamine or acrylamido 2 hydroxyl propyltrimethyl ammonium salt. A process for making the graft copolymers is provided in which the reaction is carried out while maintaining the reaction mixture in gel form. A process for removing solids from water by flocculation using the graft copolymers is also provided.
