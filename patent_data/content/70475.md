# Method of making a moisture curable silicon terminated polymer.

## Abstract
The method comprises reacting a polyurethane prepolymer having terminal active hydrogen atoms with an isocyanato organosilane having a terminal isocyanate group and at least one hydrolyzable alkoxy group bonded to silicon. The moisture curable polymer obtained by this method can advantageously be used in sealant com positions. The polymer presents a very rapid cure rate in the presence of moisture, and it is stable under unhydrous conditions.
