# A SIGNALLING INPUT OUTPUT PROCESSING MODULE FOR A TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An input output processing module utilized for process ing of signaling information and arranged in a central control unit of a local central office of a digital telecommunications system. Each central office further includes a central switching network and a plurality of trunks dedicated to common channel signaling each locally associated with a signaling link controller unit. Within the processing module, a microprocessor system is provided for initiating, starting and controlled resetting of transfers of signaling information under supervision of the cen tral control unit. The signaling link controllers utiiized for com mon channel signaling are residing on a separate signaling link bus. A signaling link bus control arrangement is connected to both the microprocessor system and the signaling link bus and includes programmable control means for sequentially execut ing transfer operations of signaling information. Interface means are independently accessible by both the microproces sor system and the control means of the signaling link bus control arrangement for enabling bi directional data transfers between the microprocessor system and the bus control ar rangement.
