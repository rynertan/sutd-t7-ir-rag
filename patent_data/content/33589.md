# Method of preparing a catalyst for synthesizing unsaturated esters.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a catalyst for the diacyloxylation of conjugated dienes such as butadiene by reaction with a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid and oxygen, which com prises separately and successively impregnating a carrier, for example carbon, with a solution of a Group VIII noble metal in a mixture of a mineral acid and an organic solvent, then with a solution of a Group VIA, VA or VIA element or compound thereof in an organic solvent.
