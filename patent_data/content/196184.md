By virtue of both their lipoxygenase and cyclo oxygenase inhibitory properties, said compounds and salts find application in the treatment and or prophylaxis of any condition where a dual lipoxygenase cyclo oxygenase inhibitor is indicated, especially any condition involving blood platelet aggregation or inflammation. In the case of inflammation, the compounds and salts are particularly suited to the treatment and or prophylaxis of conditions associated with infiltration of leucocytes into inflamed tissue. In determining when a lipoxygenase, cyclo oxygenase or dual lipoxygenase cyclo oxygenase inhibitor is indicated, of course Examples of the aforesaid spasmogenic conditions are those involving smooth muscle tissue, especially airway smooth muscle constriction such as intrinsic asthma including intrinsic or idiopathic bronchial asthma and cardiac asthma , bronchitis and arterial smooth muscle constriction such as coronary spasm including that associated with myocardial infarction, which may or may not lead to left ventricular failure resulting in cardiac asthma and cerebral spasm or stroke . Other examples include bowel disease caused by abnormal colonic muscular contraction such as may be termed irritable bowel syndrome , spastic colon or mucous colitis . Examples of the aforesaid allergic conditions are extrinsic asthma from which it will be appreciated that said compounds and salts are particularly favourable as anti asthmatic agents , allergic skin diseases such as eczema having a total or partial allergic origin, allergic bowel disease including coeliac disease and allergic eye conditions such as hayfever which may additionally or alternatively affect the upper respiratory tract and allergic conjunctivitis.

It is known in the literature that some compounds which are cyclo oxygenase and or lipoxygenase inhibitors can delay the decay of cut plant matter. Thus, it is now believed that by virtue of their enzyme inhibitory effects, the compounds of formula I and salts thereof are also useful for controlling the processes of growth and decay in plants. Thus the present invention also provides the compounds of formula I and their salts for use in a method of regulating the growth of, or delaying senescence in vegetable matter by application to said matter of an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a salt thereof. The term senescence refers to the process whereby plant matter decays, especially after being picked, cut or otherwise removed from its normal growing environment. Vegetable matter includes trees, shrubs, flowers and edible vegetables and other food crops. The above method is particularly applicable to flowers intended for decorative or display purposes such as carnations, crysanthemums, daisies, begonias, etc. These include perennial annual and biannual flowers, for example those that grow from bulbs eg dahlias or from seed eg marigolds . The method is also especially suited to use with decorative shrubs and trees, for example those which are displayed when cut, such as christmas trees. The compound of formula I and their salts may also be used for the preservation of picked fruits. For medical use, the amount required of a compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter referred to as the active ingredient to achieve a therapeutic effect will, of course, vary both with the particular compound, the route of administration and the mammal under treatment and the particular disorder or disease concerned. A suitable dose of a compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt thereof for a mammal suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition as described hereinbefore is 0.1 µg 500mg of base per kilogram bodyweight. In the case of systemic administration, the dose may be in the range 0.5 to 500 mg of base per kilogram bodyweight, the most preferred dosage being 0.5 to 50 mg kg of mammal bodyweight for example 5 to 25 mg kg administered two or three times daily. In the case of topical administration, eg. to the skin or eye, a suitable dose may be in the range 0.1µg 100µg of base per kilogram, typically about 0.1 µg Kg. In the case of oral dosing for the treatment or prophylaxis of airway smooth muscle constriction, or asthma or bronchitis in general, due to any course, a suitable dose of a compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt thereof, may be as specified in the preceding paragraph, but most preferably is from is 1 mg to 10 mg of base per kilogram, the most preferred dosage being from 1 mg to 5 mg kg of mammal bodyweight, for example from 1 to 2 mg kg. In the case of pulmonary administration for the latter indications, the dose may be in the range of from 2 µg to 100 mg, for example from 20 µg to 0.5 mg, especially 0.1 to 0.5 mg kg. While it is possible for an active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof and a physiologically acceptable carrier therefor. Such formulations consitute a further feature of the present invention. Conveniently, the active ingredient comprises from 0.1 to 99.9 by weight of the formulation. Conveniently, unit doses of a formulation contain between 0.1 mg and 1 g of the active ingredient. For topical administration, the active ingredient preferably comprises from 1 to 2 by weight of the formulation but the active ingredient may comprise as much as 10 w w. Formulations suitable for nasal or buccal administration, such as self propelling powder dispensing formulations described hereinafter , may comprise 0.1 to 20 w w, for example 2 w w of active ingredient. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human medical use, of the present invention comprise an active ingredient in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredient s . The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulations include those in a form suitable for oral, pulmonary, ophthalmic, rectal, parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous , intra articular, topical, nasal or buccal administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient in the form of a powder or granules in the form of a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non aqueous liquid or in the form of an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil emulsion. The active ingredient may also be in the form of a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compressing or moulding the active ingredient optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing a gent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered active ingredient and a suitable carrier moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Formulations for rectal administration may be in the form of a suppository incorporating the active ingredient and a carrier such as cocoa butter, or in the form of an enema. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active ingredient which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Formulations suitable for intra articular administration may be in the form of a sterile aqueous preparation of the active ingredient which may be in microcrystalline form, for example, in the form of an aqueous microcrystalline suspension. Liposomal formulations or biodegradable polymer systems may also be used to present the active ingredient for both intra articular and ophthalmic administration. A particularly valuable form of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of airway smooth muscle constriction, or asthma or bronchitis in general, due to any cause, is one suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Preferably the composition is such that particles having a diameter of 0.5 to 7 µ, most preferably 1 to 6 µ, containing active ingredient, are delivered into the lungs of a patient. Such compositions are conveniently in the form of dry powders for administration from a powder inhalation device or self propelling powder dispensing containers, for example as a self propelling aerosol composition in a sealed container preferably the powders comprise particles containing active ingredient of which particles at least 98 by weight have a diameter greater than 0.5 µ and at least 95 by number have a diameter less than 7 µ. Most desirably at least 95 by weight of the particles have a diameter greater than 1 µ at least 90 by number of the particles have a diameter less than 6 µ. The compositions in the form of dry powders preferably include a solid fine powder diluent such as sugar and are conveniently presented in a pierceable capsule, for example of gelatin. Self propelling compositions of the invention may be either powder dispensing compositions or compositions dispensing the active ingredient in the form of droplets of a solution or suspension. Self propelling powder dispensing compositions include a liquid propellant having a boiling point of below 65 F at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50 to 99.9 w w of the composition whilst the active ingredient may constitute 0.1 to 20 w w, for example about 2 w w of the composition. The carrier in such compositions may include other constituents, in particular a liquid non ionic or solid anionic surfactant, or a solid diluent preferably having a particle size of the same order as of the particles of active ingredient or both. The surfactant may constitute from 0.01 up to 20 w w, though preferably it constitutes below 1 w w of the composition. Self propelling compositions wherein the active ingredient is present in solution comprise an active ingredient, propellant and co solvent, and advantageously an antioxidant stabiliser. The co solvents may constitute 5 to 40 w w of the composition, though preferably less than 20 w w of the composition. Compositions of the present invention may also be in the form of aqueous or dilute alcoholic solution, optionally a sterile solution, of the active ingredient for use in a nebuliser or atomiser. Formulations of the present invention may also be in the form of an aqueous or dilute alcoholic solution, optionally a sterile solution, of the active ingredient for use in a nebuliser or atomiser, wherein an accelerated air steam is used to produce a fine mist consisting of small droplets of the solution. Such formulations usually contain a flavouring agent such as saccharin sodium and a volatile oil. A buffering agent and a surface active agent may also be included in such a formulation which should also contain a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate. Other formulations suitable for nasal administration include a coarse powder having a particle size of 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may include one or more additional ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives eg. methylhydroxybenzoate including anti oxidants , emulsifying agents and the like. Any other therapeutic ingredient may comprise one or more of the following antibiotic e.g. anti bacterial , anti fungal and anti viral agents, and anti histamines particularly peripherally acting ant histamines . However, when such other agent s are also present, according to another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt thereof and the other agent s , need not necessarily be present as a pharmaceutical formulation as hereinbefore defined, but merely in combination or intimate admixture, i.e. optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier need not be present. For delaying senescence of cut or picked plant matter, or for controlling plant growth, the compounds of formula I and their salts are preferably presented in a suitable composition, optionally containing one or more other agents for enhancing the freshness of the plants. Such compositions include solutions and suspensions of the compound in a suitable medium such as an aqueous medium. The compositions may be applied by immersing part eg the cut end or whole of the plant or by spraying the plants before ar after cutting or picking, or by application to the root structure before or after picking. The compounds may also be applied by being spread on the soil prior to cutting or picking and conveyed to the plant roots by rainwater, or by other watering means. When applied in aqueous solution, the compounds may be presented in a concentration of from 1µM to 1M, for example 100µM to 100mM. A typical concentration might be about 1mM.
