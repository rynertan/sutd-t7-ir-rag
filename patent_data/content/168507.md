# Osmotic cervical dilator.

## Abstract
An osmotic cervical dilator has a sponge like synthetic plastic body in which all the residual void spaces in the body are filled with a salt composition and the body shaped for insertion and retention in the cervix of the patient. The dilator, once inserted and retained by the cervix, is adapted to draw and to expand by osmotic effect and to retain cervi cal fluids and particularly water contained in the cervix.
