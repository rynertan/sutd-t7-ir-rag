## Description
The present invention relates to an optical head for focusing an optical beam on an information recording medium such as an optical disk, to record information on, reproduce it from, or erase it from, the information recording medium and, more particularly, to a system for detecting the displacement of the focal point of the optical head. Recently, various systems for recording information on an information recording medium, e.g., an optical disk, have been developed. In each system, a beam spot corresponding to the waist of a light beam converged by an objective lens of an optical head must be formed on the optical disk to record information on, reproduce it from, or erase it from, the optical disk. The optical head has a system for detecting the focusing condition of the objective lens. A focusing condition detecting system which employs a so called knife edge method is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 399,873 filed on July 19, 1982, and also in EP A 0 070 552 The detecting system has a light shielding plate provided between the data recording surface of an optical disk and a photodetector with two photosensing regions to shield a part of a light beam reflected from the data recording surface and to allow the passage of another part of the light beam. The remaining part of the light beam is applied to the photosensitive regions of the photodetector. In this optical path, there is provided a prism for reflecting the light beam in the direction of movement of the beam on the detector. However, by this prism the light beam diameter is not reduced, but is expanded, since the prism has the plane of incidence slanting to the optical axis, and the other plane where the beam leaves the prism, is perpendicular to the optical axis. When the light beam is accurately focused on the optical disk, the photosensing regions generate electrical signals of the same level. When the beam is inaccurately focused on the optical disk, the photosensing regions output electrical signals of different levels. It can thus be determined from these signals whether or not the light beam has been accurately focused on the optical disk. The accuracy of determining the focusing condition is proportional to the lateral magnification of the beam spot formed on the photosensor, which corresponds to the waist of the light beam which is formed on the optical disk. As long as the same objective lens having a fixed focal distance is used, the lateral magnification is inversely proportional to the angular aperture of the projection lens used to converge the light beam on the photodetector and directly proportional to the focal distance of this projection lens. Hence, to raise the accuracy of determining the focusing condition, it suffices to use the focusing lens having a long focal distance. However, the longer the focal distance, the longer the light path of the optical system of the optical head, and the larger the optical head. The object of the present invention is to provide a compact optical head with a system which can accurately determine whether or not a light beam has been accurately focused on an information recording medium. According to the invention, there is provided an optical head comprising the features as claimed in claim 1. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 schematically shows an optical disk 21 and an optical head 32 according to the present invention. As shown in this figure, disk 21 is made up of a pair of transparent disks 22 and 23, an inner spacer 24, an outer spacer 25, and two light reflecting layers 26 and 27. Spacers 24 and 25 are interposed between disks 22 and 23, spacing these disks and holding them parallel to each other. Layer 26 is vapor deposited on the inner surface of transparent disk 22, and the layer 37 is vapor deposited on the inner surface of transparent disk 23. Layers 26 and 27 are information recording layers. A helical tracking guide is formed on each of these layers. Pits are cut in layers 26 and 27 along the tracking guides, recording information on these layers. Optical disk 21 has a center hole. When disk 21 is put on a turntable 28, the spindle 29 of turntable 28 is inserted in this hole, axially aligning disk 21 with turntable 28 as shown in Fig. 1. After disk 21 has been coaxially set on turntable 28, a chuck 30 is mounted on spindle 29, thereby securing disk 21 to turntable 28. Turntable 28 is rotatably supported by a base not shown . A motor 31 rotates turntable 28 at a constant speed. Optical head 32 can be moved by a linear actuator 49 in the radial direction of optical disk 21. Head 32 contains a semiconductor laser 33 for emitting a laser beam L. To write information on optical disk 21, laser 33 emits a beam L having the intensity modulated in accordance with the information. To read information from disk 21, laser 33 emits a beam of a specified intensity. Laser beam L is converted by a collimator lens 34 to a parallel laser beam L, which is applied to a polarizing beam splitter 35. Beam L passes through a quarter wave plate 36 and is applied to an objective lens 37. Lens 37 focuses beam L on the layer 27 of disk 21. Lens 37 is supported by a voice coil 38, movable along its own optical axis. When lens 37 is in a neutral position, it accurately focuses beam L, thus forming the smallest beam spot corresponding to the beam waist of beam L on light reflecting layer 27. In this accurate focusing state, optical head 32 can form pits along the helical tracking guide, thereby writing information on disk 21, or can receive beam L whose intensity has been modulated by the pits, thereby reading the information from disk 21. The diverging laser beam reflected from the light reflecting layer 27 of optical disk 21 is converted by objective lens 37 to a parallel laser beam L when beam L has been accurately focused on layer 27. Parallel beam L passes through quarter wave plate 36 and is applied to beam splitter 35. As beam L passes twice through quarter wave plate 36, its polarization plane rotates 90 . As shown in Fig. 1, beam splitter 35 is comprised of two prisms 35 1 and 35 2 which are combined together. The interface between these prisms is a polarization plane 35 3. Unlike in the ordinary polarizing beam splitter, prism 35 1 splits the laser beam reflected from layer 27 into two parts and emits these parts from two laser beam emerging surfaces 35 1A and 35 1B. Surfaces 35 1A and 35 1B are inclined at different angles to the common optical axis 39 of lenses 34 and 37. Laser beam L reflected from polarizing plane 35 3 passes through prism 35 1. That part of beam L which reaches surface 35 1A is deflected upwardly Fig. 1 and emitted from prism 35 1 as a laser beam L₁. The remaining part of beam L which reaches surface 35 1B is deflected downward Fig. 1 and emitted from prism 35 1 as a laser beam L₂. Hence, beams L₁ and L₂ is directed in different directions. Needless to say, beams L₁ and L₂ are slender than beam L passing through prism 35 1. They are converged by a projection lens 42. Converged beam L₁ is applied to a photodetector 45 for detecting the focusing state, and converged beam L₂ is applied to a photodetector 43 for detecting the information and the tracking guide. Photodetector 45 is placed in the image forming plane on which the optical system forms the beam spot corresponding to the waist of beam L when objective lens 37 accurately focuses beam L on light reflecting layer 27. In other words, photodetector 45 is positioned at the back focal point of projection lens 42. On the other hand, the photodetector 43 is placed in a far field plane. As shown in Fig. 2A, photosensor 45 has two photosensitive regions 45 1 and 45 2 with a photoinsensitive region 45 3 provided between these photosensitive regions. Regions 45 1 and 45 2 produce electrical signals upon receiving light. Photodetector 45 is coupled to a focus signal generator 46 for generating a focus signal representing the difference in level between the signals from regions 45 1 and 45 2, which is supplied to a voice coil driver 47. When laser beam L is accurately focused on light reflecting layer 27, beam L₁ is mostly applied to region 45 3, forming the smallest beam spot S1 as shown in Fig. 2A two small parts of spot S1, substantially equal in size, are formed on photosensitive regions 45 1 and 45 2. in this case, signal generator 46 outputs a focus signal at zero level. Voice coil driver 47 remains to drive voice coil 38, whereby objective lens 37 is held in the neutral position. When objective lens 37 is too close to light reflecting layer 27, beam L₁ is more applied to region 45 1 than to region 45 2, forming a large spot S2 mostly on region 45 1 as shown in Fig. 2B. Hence, signal generator 46 generates a focus signal at minus level. In response to this signal, voice coil driver 47 drives voice coil 38, whereby objective lens 37 is moved away from light reflecting layer 27 to the neutral position, thus accurately focusing beam L on layer 27. In contrast, when objective lens 37 is too far from light reflecting layer 27, beam L₁ is more applied to region 45 2 than to region 45 1, forming a large spot S3 mostly on region 45 2 as shown in Fig. 2C. Hence, signal generator 46 generates a focus signal at minus level. In response to this signal, voice coil driver 47 drives voice coil 38, whereby objective lens 37 is moved from light reflecting layer 17 until it reaches the neutral position, thus accurately focusing beam L on layer 27. Photodetector 43 placed in the far field plane has two photosensitive regions 43 1 and 43 2 with a photoinsensitive region 43 3 provided between regions 43 1 and 43 2, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. Laser beam L₂ converged by projection lens 42 is applied to photodetector 43, forming a spot S4 larger than the smallest spot S1 even if objective lens 37 accurately focuses laser beam L on light reflecting layer 27. A signal processor 44 is coupled to photosensitive regions 43 1 and 43 2. A tracking signal generator 48 is coupled to photosensitive regions 43 1 and 43 2. When laser beam L is accurately directed to the tracking guide on light reflecting layer 27, a beam spot S4 is formed on photodetector 43 as shown in Fig. 3C. Spot S4 has a darker portion D0, i.e., a diffractive image of the tracking guide of optical disk 21. Portion D0 is formed on both photosensitive regions 43 1 and 43 2, occupying substantially the same area of either photosensitive region. Regions 43 1 and 43 2 generate electrical signals. Signal processor 44 adds these signals, thus generating signals showing the information recorded on layer 27. Signal generator 48 generates a tracking signal corresponding to the difference between these electrical signals. The difference is in effect zero, and the tracking signal at zero level is fed to a linear actuator 49. Since the tracking signal is at zero level, actuator 49 does not move optical head 32 at all. When laser beam L fails to trace the tracking guide, portion D0 of spot S4 is on region 43 1 as shown in Fig. 3B or on region 43 2 as shown in Fig. 3A. In the case of Fig. 3B, signal generator 48 generates a focus signal at a positive level. In the case of Fig. 3A, it outputs a tracking signal at a negative level. The tracking signal is supplied to linear actuator 49, which moves optical head 32 in the direction parallel to layer 27 until beam L comes to accurately trace the tracking guide. Beam L₁ is thinner than the beam which reflected from polarization plane 35 3 and reaches beam emerging surface 35 1B. Similarly, beam L₂ is thinner than the beam which reflected from polarization plane 35 3 and reaches beam emerging surface 35 1A. Each of the beams L₁, L₂ has an elongated cross sectional shape which extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction to which the image of the tracking guide is extended. This enables the optical system of head 32 to accurately detect the focusing state. The reason why so will be described with reference to Fig. 4 showing the optical system. As shown in Fig. 4, a prism 40 and a light shield 41 are arranged in the optical path between objective lens 37 and projection lens 42. Prism 40 refracts a laser beam L₀, and shield 41 shields the lower half of the section of beam L₀. When laser beam L is accurately focused on light reflecting layer 27, a parallel beam L travels from lens 37 to lens 42. Prism 40 and shield 41 function almost in the same way as the prism 35 1 of polarizing beam splitter 35. An image forming system of objective lens 32 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. In this figure, f₀ is the focal distance of objective lens 37, and δ is the distance between the position which lens 37 takes when beam L is accurately focused on light reflecting layer 27 and the position which beam L takes when beam L is not accurately focused on layer 27. The line shown in Fig. 5 is a ray which extends from layer 27, passes through a point on the main surface of lens 37 located at distance h₀ from the optical axis of the optical system, and refracted by lens 37 toward the optical axis of the optical system. Obvious, δ 0 when beam L is accurately focused on layer 27. When beam L is not accurately focused on layer 27 and optical head 32 is moved toward disk 21 for distance δ, the waist of beam L, which is formed as beam L is reflected from light reflecting layer 27, is located at the distance of 2δ from objective lens 37. On the other hand, when beam L is not accurately focused on layer 27 and optical head 32 has moved away disk 21 for distance δ, beam L is reflected from layer 27 after forming a beam waist behind layer 27. Hence, the beam waist of beam L is located at the distance of 2δ from objective lens 37. In other words, when optical head 32 is moved for distance δ, the distance between the beam waist and the main surface of lens 37 is f₀ 2δ as is evident from Fig.5. If the beam waist is regarded as a point, angles β₀ and β₂ will be given by following equations 1 and 2 From the formula applicable to the image forming of a lens Therefore If prism 40 were not provided in the optical system of Fig. 4, the ray shown in Fig. 5 would be as shown in Fig. 6. From the locus of the ray, which is illustrated in Fig. 6, the deflection h2 of laser beam spot is formed on photodetector 45 is delivered. In Fig. 6, a is the distance between the main surface of objective lens 37 and light shield 41, L is the distance between the main surface of objective lens 37 and that of projection lens 42, H is the distance between the main surface of projection lens 42 and the light receiving surface of photodetector 45, and y is the distance between the ray and the optical axis of lenses 37 and 42. Let us assume that projection lens 42 has a focal distance f₁. Distance y is given as follows If equation 3 will reduce to The distance h₁ between the optical axis and the point on the main surface of lens 42, where the ray passes, is given by the following equation Angle β₂ is given as follows The distance h₂ between the optical axis and the point on the light receiving surface of photodetector 45, where the ray passes, is given by the following equation When δ 0, that is, when laser beam L is accurately focused on light reflecting surface 27, h₂ 0. The condition for satisfying this in equation 8 is The lateral magnification m of the spot formed on the light receiving surface of photodetector 45 when beam L is accurately focused on layer 27 is expressed as It has been assumed that in the optical system of Fig. 5, the beam waist of beam is located at the focal point of objective lens 37. When a diverging or converging laser beam is applied to objective lens 37, the waist of this beam is formed at a distance b from the focal point of lens 37. In this case, distance h₂ can be found by similar calculations, substituting 2δ b for 2δ and assuming that the whole optical system is one combination lens. That is Here, when a 0, When f₀ b is much greater than 2δ, In equations 14 16 , sign indicates an upright image and sign indicates an inverted image. Equations 13 and 16 clearly show that the accuracy of determining the focusing condition in the optical systems of Figs. 5 and 6 is proportional to the lateral magnification m. It will now be described how a laser beam travels in the optical system Fig. 4 having prism 40, with reference to Figs. 4 and 7. When laser beam L is accurately focused on light reflecting layer 27, the parallel laser beam L₀ having a diameter c is at the right angles to the input surface 40 1 of prism 40. It is refracted as it emerges from the output surface 40 2 of prism 40. As a result, the diameter c of beam L₀ is reduced to a diameter d. Let us assume that the perpendicular to surface 40 2 is inclined at an retraction angle ϑ to the axis 39 of beam L₀ and at an incident angle α to the axis of the beam coming out of surface 40 2, the following is established When the surface of layer 27 is at a distance of δ from the focal point of objective lens 37 as shown in Fig. 4, the angle β₁ at which beam L₀ is incident on the input surface 40 1 of prism 40 is expressed as This will be clearly understood from equations 2 and 5 . Further, the angle σ at which beam L₀ is refracted at the prism surface 40 2 is given as follows, provided both β₁ and σ are very small According to the Snell laws of refraction, refractive index n of prism 40 is Wherein µ is the deviation of the angle α. Substituting equation 18 in equation 22 , we obtain The deflection h₂ of laser beam spot formed on photodetector 45 is calculated by substituting u for β₁ in equations 7 and 8 and by using equation 9 . Hence Substituting this value in equation 12 , we obtain The comparison of equations 13 and 25 shows the optical system Fig. 4 with prism 40 can M times more accurately than the optical system Fig. 5 without prism 40. In the optical system of Fig. 4, prism 40 refracts laser beam L₀ and slightly reduces the diameter of this beam, thus increasing the size of the beam spot formed on photodetector 45 for determining the focusing condition of head 32. Alternatively, projection lens 42 may be replaced by another of a shorter focal distance, making the optical system smaller and lighter without damaging to the accuracy of determining the focusing condition. Fig. 8 shows the second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a polarizing beam splitter 51 has a prism 53 which refracts an input laser beam L₀ but does not split beam L₀ into two beams. The diameter of beam L₀ is reduced as this beam emerges from the output surface 52 of prism 53. Beam L₀ with the reduced diameter is applied to a half mirror 54. A laser beam L₁ reflected by half mirror 54 is applied to a first photodetector 56 through a first projection lens 55. On the other hand, the laser beam L₂ passing through half mirror 54 is shielded by a shield 57 and is applied to a second photodetector 59 through a second projection lens 58. Fig. 9 shows the third embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the laser beam L reflected from a polarizing beam splitter 61 is applied to a half mirror 62. Half mirror 62 designed to split beam L into two beams L₁ and L₂ has two light emerging surfaces. A prism 64 is attached to light emerging surface 63. Hence, beam L₁ reflected from mirror 62 is applied through a first projection lens 65 to a first photodetector 66. Beam L₂ passing through half mirror 62 is refracted by prism 64 as it emerges from prism 64. The diameter of beam L₂ is reduced as beam L₂ is refracted. Laser beam L₂ is shielded by a shield 67 and is applied to a second photodetector 69 through a second projection lens 68. Fig. 10 shows the fourth embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a prism 72 is arranged in the path of a beam L reflected from a polarizing beam splitter 71. Prism 73 has an input surface 73 at right angles to the axis 39 of beam L and an output surface 74 inclined at a small angle thereto. It is positioned such that a portion L₃ of beam L is applied to a first photodetector 76 through a projection lens 75, while the other portion L₄ is applied to a second photodetector 77 through prism 72 and projection lens 75. Beam L₄ is refracted by prism 72, and its diameter is reduced. Fig. 11 shows the fifth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment has two convex lenses 81 and 82 arranged in the path of a laser beam L between an objective lens and a projection lens. These lenses are used to reduce the diameter of beam L. Fig. 12 shows the sixth embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment has a convex lens 83 and a concave lens 84, both arranged in the path of a laser beam L between an objective lens and a projection lens. Lenses 83 and 84 cooperate to reduce the diameter of beam L. The second to sixth embodiments have the same advantages as the first embodiment. The projection lens used in each embodiment may be replaced by two cylindrical convex lenses or by one cylindrical convex lens and one cylindrical concave lens. In the fifth embodiment Fig. 11 and the sixth embodiment Fig. 12 , the diameter of the laser beam is reduced, but the cross sectional shape thereof remains unchanged. In contrast, in the other embodiments, the size of the beam spot is reduced only in one direction, changing the circular beam spot to an elliptical one. As mentioned above, according to this invention, a laser beam having a diameter smaller than the parallel beam applied to the objective lens is applied to the projection lens. Therefore, the optical head is small and can accurately determine the focusing condition of the laser beam.
