## Description
This invention relates to novel purified forms of glycoproteins found in cells infected with human T cell lymphotrophic virus, type III HTLV III , and to assays for detecting in a biological specimen the presence of an antibody to the antigenic determinants present in said glycoproteins. HTLV III is suspected of playing a key role in the pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS . It has been shown that human patients whose bodies contain antibodies to HTLV III infected cells are apparently latently or actively infected with the virus. According to EP A 0201540 a glycoprotein is known having a molecular weight of approximately 90,000 daltons in unglycoslated form and 110,000 daltons in glycosylated form. This glycoprotein can be obtained from a lysate of a lymphadenopathy retrovirus which includes antigens selectively recognized in vitro by serum of patients affected with AIDS or by serum of asymptomatic carriers of the AIDS virus. Further, this glycoprotein can be obtained from cultures of T lymphocytes infected with HTLV III and from HTLV III preparations. It has now been found that particular polypeptides or glycoproteins present in HTLV III virions or in human cells infected with HTLV III and related viruses, when purified and isolated, contain an antigenic determinant or determinants which provide a high degree of sensitivity and immunospecificity for antibody to human cells infected with HTLV III and related viruses. For convenience, when we use either the term HTLV III , or the term HTLV III related viruses , in this application, we mean to include viruses that are closely related to HTLV III by serological biochemical and molecular criteria, including lymphadenopathy associated virus LAV see Barre Sinoussi 1983 Science Consequently, the substantially pure glycoproteins or their unglycosylated moieties are useful as a diagnostic tool for assaying biological specimens to determine prior or current infection with HTLV III. Other polypeptides containing immunologically cross reactive antigenic determinants are useful for the same purpose. By polypeptides containing immunologically cross reactive antigenic determinants , we mean polypeptides having in common antigenic determinants with which a given antibody will react. Such other polypeptides include the unglycosylated moieties of the glycoproteins, chemically synthesized polypeptides, and polypeptides made by organisms or cells engineered by recombinant DNA techniques. They also include antibodies or fragments thereof which are anti idiotypic towards the active determinant or determinants on the glycoprotein of the invention. It has also been shown that anti idiotypic reagents are useful as diagnostic tools for the detection of antigens carrying sites which are immunologically cross reactive with those on the antibodies Potocnjak et al., Science 215 1637 1639 1982 . Thus, an assay for HTLV III infection could be carried out with the aid of an anti idiotypic or immunologically active fragments thereof which carry an antigenic site or sites thereon which are immunologically similar to the antigenic site or sites on the glycoproteins of the invention. Such anti idiotypic antibodies can be raised against first antibodies having specificity against the antigenic sites on the glycoproteins of the invention i.e. the anti idiotypic antibodies are anti antibodies . Preferably monoclonal anti idiotypic antibodies are used. The invention therefore embraces substantially pure glycoprotein having a molecular weight of approximately 160,000 daltons, of which approximately 90,000 daltons is the molecular weight of the unglycosylated moiety, said glycoprotein being substantially identical to an envelope glycoprotein encoded by the largest open reading frame in the 3 half of the human T cell lymphotropic virus, type III genome and obtainable from cells infected with human T cell lymphotrophic virus, type III. An assay for HTLV III infection is important because the virus can be readily transferred from the peripheral blood leukocytes of antibody positive people to leukocytes of antibody negative people when the two are cultivated together. Popovic et al., Science, Vol. 219, 856 859 1983 . Consequently, it appears that there is great risk of infection involved in whole blood transfusions when the transfused blood contains infected cells. The assay is of importance because biological specimens from individuals exhibiting acquired immunodeficient syndrome AIDS give a positive test for antibodies to antigenic determinants of the novel glycoproteins, thus facilitating diagnosis of that disease. Consequently, the invention also embraces the method of assaying a biological specimen for the presence of antibody to HTLV III specific glycoproteins which comprises 1 incubating said specimen with a polypeptide having an antigenic determinant or determinants immunologically cross reactive with those of a glycoprotein having a molecular weight of approximately 160,000 daltons gp160 , the 90,000 dalton unglycosylated moiety of which has substantially all of the antigenic determinants of the glycoprotein, the glycoprotein being an envelope glycoprotein encoded by the largest open reading frame in the 3 half of the HTLV III genome and being obtained from cells infected with HTLV III and 2 determining whether or not an immunocomplex is formed between said antibody and said polypeptide. The invention also embraces a method of assaying a biological specimen for the presence of antigenic determinant or determinants immunologically cross reactive with the determinants of the glycoprotein of molecular weight In the drawings, Fig. 1 represents an autoradiogram showing specific activities of gp120 and gp160 as determined by gel electrophoresis.

Fig. 5 represents a nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence for the amino terminal ends of gp160 and gp120. The glycoprotein of the present invention has a molecular weight of The glycoproteins can be obtained from HTLV III infected cells gp120 can also be obtained from HTLV III virions. A variety of cell lines have been prepared, which are permanently and persistently infected with HTLV III among them can be mentioned HTLV III infected H9 cells, Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus LAV infected NC37 cells, and Molt 3 and HUT 78 cells infected with fresh AIDS virus isolates. It may be that the exact sizes of the novel glycoproteins are slightly different in different lines however, the common immunologically cross reactive portions of the glycoproteins are the same regardless of cell line, since they are portions encoded by HTLV III. Thus, any cell which harbors the virus may be an appropriate source for the novel glycoproteins. In order to obtain the protein from any infected cells carrying the virus, the cells are metabolically labelled e.g. with ³⁵S cysteine and immunoprecipitated with antisera obtained from HTLV III infected subjects. The novel glycoproteins can then be detected and isolated by gel electrophoresis or other chromatographic procedures. The glycoproteins are For example, the glycoproteins are present in HTLV III infected human T cell line H9, LAV infected NC37 cells, and Molt 3 and HUT 78 cells infected with fresh AIDS virus isolates. The glycoproteins can readily be separated from the cells of these cell lines by lysis thereof and SDS gel electrophoresis. The purified and isolated glycoproteins or any antigen immunologically cross reactive therewith can be employed as a standard antigen in any conventional assay procedure for detection in biological specimens of the presence of antibodies specific thereto, hence of the presence of HTLV III infection and or of AIDS. The antibodies specific to such HTLV III antigens are not found in patients suffering from diseases such as hepatitis which are not accompanied by HTLV III infection. The glycoproteins or polypeptides immunologically cross reactive therewith can be labelled by conventional procedures with ¹²⁵I or ³⁵S or ³H for use in radioimmunoassay, with fluorescein for fluorescent immunoassay, with enzyme for enzyme immunoassay or with biotin, for biotin avidin linked assays. It can be employed labelled or unlabelled as desired, in competitive immunoassays, as well as in double antibody assays using two antibodies, either of the idiotype antiidiotype variety or more particularly of the second antibody type using an anti Fc antibody, or other assays. Alternatively, the novel glycoproteins or polypeptides immunologically cross reactive therewith could be immobilized on an insoluble phase, such as an insoluble resin, and detection of the anti glycoprotein antibodies is carried out by measuring their binding to the insoluble phase. Insoluble phases also include latex particles, which when coated with the novel glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides and subjected to anti glycoprotein antibody, will agglutinate. Yet other insoluble phases include test tubes, vials, titration wells, and the like, to which the novel glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptide can be bound, and antibody thereto detected by double antibody techniques or Protein A dependent techniques. The assay for antibodies which recognize HTLV III induced antigens may utilize the glycoprotein or glycoproteins or the unglycosylated moieties of the glycoproteins, respectively, in crude form, and is not limited to using these proteins in substantially pure form. For example, the glycoprotein s may be first substantially purified and then mixed together. Alternatively cruder mixtures can also be used. The elements necessary for carrying out the diagnostic methodology described hereinbefore may be present in a kit. Such kit comprises a carrier being compartmentalized to receive therein one or more containers, which of said containers comprising one or more elements necessary to carry out the tests. For example, the first container may contain one or both of the purified glycoproteins or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides in detectably labelled or in insolubilized form. A second container may comprise anti IgG antibody, polyclonal or monoclonal, useful in double antibody binding assay, or elements needed for detection of the label on the glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides e.g. chromogenic substrates . Additional containers may comprise varying amounts of one of the glycoproteins or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides which can be used to prepare a standard curve into which experimental results can be interpolated. The materials may be present in the kit by themselves, in solution, freeze dried, or in admixture with other inert materials, such as inert proteins, and the like. The biological specimens tested may include blood, serum, lymphocytes, urine, tissues, saliva, feces, and the like. Of particular interest is the screening of blood in blood banks, to assure that the blood is not contaminated with HTLV III. Screening of blood derived products, such as vaccines, can also be done by the methods of the invention. The following specific examples are intended to illustrate more fully the nature of the invention without acting as a limitation upon its scope. The reactivity of serum samples positive for antibodies to HTLV III induced cell membrane antigens HTLV III MA was determined by RIP SDS PAGE, the proteins being separated on a 12.5 SDS polyacrylamide gel with 3.5 stacking gel using the Laemmli buffer system. Uninfected H9 cells a , and H9 cells infected with HTLV III b at their peak log phase of growth were harvested and exposed to ³⁵S cysteine 100 µCi ml specific activity 957.5 Ci mmole for 14 16 hours. A soluble cell lysate was obtained and cleared once with a reference negative control serum bound to Protein A Sepharose CL4B Protein A beads as described by Essex et al., 1983 Science 220 859, before portions were reacted with 8 µl of the following sera preabsorbed with Protein A beads with the results shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing A sera from 8 AIDS patients that were positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 1 8 , B sera from 4 ARC patients that were positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 1 4 and sera from 4 healthy homosexuals that were positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 5 8 C sera from 2 healthy homosexuals that were negative for anti HTLV III MA lanes 1 2 , sera from 2 laboratory workers that were negative for anti HTLV III MA lanes 3 4 , a mouse monoclonal antibody to p24 of HTLV III lane 5 , a normal rabbit serum lane 6 , a reference rabbit antiserum to disrupted HTLV III lane 7 , and a positive control ARC patient lane 8 . The molecular weight markers were ¹⁴C labeled myosin 200,000 , phosphorylase b 92,500 , bovine serum albumin 69,000 , ovalbumin 46,000 , carbonic anhydrase 30,000 and lysozyme 14,300 . H9 cells infected with HTLV III at their peak log phase of growth were harvested and exposed to ³⁵S cysteine 100 µCi ml specific activity 957.5 Ci mmole for 14 16 hours. To enrich glycoprotein fractions, the soluble cell lysate was first reacted with lentil lectin sepharose 4B at a ratio of 20 x 10⁶ cells to 1 ml of lentil lectin 4B at 4 C for 3 hours. Deoxycholate free RIPA buffer in the presence of 5 methyl α D mannoside was used to elute the glycoprotein fraction. The glycoprotein fraction was analyzed using RIP SDS PAGE with human sera positive for anti HTLV III MA. The ³⁵S cysteine labeled glycoproteins were reacted with 8 µl of the following sera with the results shown in Fig. 2 4 sera from 4 AIDS patients positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 1 4 , 2 sera from 2 ARC patients that were positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 5 6 , 2 sera from 2 healthy homosexuals that were positive for anti HTLV III MA lanes 7 8 , 2 sera from healthy homosexuals that were negative for anti HTLV III MA lanes 9 10 , and 2 sera from 2 laboratory workers that were negative for anti HTLV III MA lanes 11 12 . HTLV III infected H9 cells at their peak log phase of growth were harvested and resuspended in McCoy s 5A medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum, 1 of antibiotic antimycotic mixture, and 20 µg ml of tunicamycin for 2 hours. After this trimming step, the cells were labelled with ³⁵S cysteine as described above in the presence of 20 µg ml of tunicamycin for 3 hours. The labelled material was then subjected to the same lysing and preclearing procedures as described above. The proteins from treated and untreated cells were analyzed by human sera positive for anti HTLV III MA using RIP SDS PAGE as shown in Fig. 3, left hand lane. Soluble cell lysates from tunicamycin untreated a and treated cells b were reacted with 8 µl of a reference serum negative for antibodies to HTLV III lanes 1 2 and 8 µl of a reference serum positive for antibodies to HTLV III from an ARC patient lanes 3 4 , with the results shown in Fig. 3. The following specific examples relate to assaying a saliva specimen for antibodies to HTLV III. Whole saliva was collected from individuals and stored at 70 C. Following 1 2 dilution with phosphate buffered saline or water, samples were centrifuged and passed through 0.22 m pore size filters Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA . Radioimmunoprecipitation of ³⁵S cysteine labelled H9 HTLV III infected and H9 infected cell lysates were carried out as described above except that Protein A beads were first reacted with 10 µl of sheep anti human secretory IgA serum Cappel Lab. Inc., Cochranville, PA before addition of 150 µl of the saliva samples. Serum from an AIDS patient known to be positive for HTLV III antigens p24, p55, gp120, and gp160 was used as a positive control. Immunoprecipitates were anlayzed in a 10 acrylamide resolving gel with a 3.5 stacking gel according to the discontinuous buffer systems of Laemmli described above. Autoradiography was carried out for 5 days at 70 C. Serum samples from the same patients were obtained at approximately the same time and were tested by immunoprecipitation as described earlier. Specifically shown in Fig. 4, soluble cell lysates were prepared from H9 lanes a, c, e, g, i, k and H9 HTLV III lanes b, d, f, h, j, l cells exposed to ³⁵S cysteine, harvested, and lysed with RIPA buffer. These lysates were then reacted with 150 µl of a 1 2 dilution of saliva which had been bound to Protein A Sepharose CL 4B Protein A beads, Sigma with 10 l of sheep anti human IgA sera. Samples were as follows saliva from AIDS patient 1 lanes a, b normal laboratory worker lanes c, d AIDS patient 2 lanes e, f AIDS patient 3 lanes i, j AIDS patient 4 lanes k, l . Reference serum from AIDS patient known to be positive for HTLV III antigens lanes g, h . Approximate molecular weights in thousands are at the right.
