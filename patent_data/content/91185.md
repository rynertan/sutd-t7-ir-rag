## Description
Berbane Derivatives This invention rolates torw berbane derivatives, a process for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of racemic and optically active berbane d.erivatives of the general Formula VIEMI1.1 whereinR1 and R2 each stand.s for an alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms or R1 and R2 together form a methylenedioxy group. The compounds of the general Formula VI wherein R1 and 2 stand for C2 4 alkyl or form a methylene dioxy group are new and possess valuable pharmaceutical properties, particulalLy hypotensive effect. According to a further feature of the present invention there are provided new racemic or optically active berbane derivatives of the generalFormula VI and salts thereof. According to a stilL further feature of the present invention there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient a racemic or optically active berbane derivative of the generalFormula VI or a salt thereof in admixture with one or more inert non toxic pharmaceutical carriers, According to the process of the present in Invention the racemic or optically active berbane derivatives of the general Formula VI and salts thereof are prepared by reacting a racemic or optically active compound of the general Formula VIIEMI2.1 with a derivative of trimethoxy bonzoic acid preferably a salt thereof and isolating the product thus obtained, and if desired converting a free base obtained into a salt or liberating the base from a salt initially obtained. The details of the prooess of the present invention are shown in conneotion with the preparation of the mothylenedioxy derivative of the Formula I.EMI3.1 The racemic compound ,i is prepared by reacting the known methyl 15 bromor 7,8 methylene dioxy 14 oxo epiallo barbans 13 carboxylate Chem. fler. L09 1976 with a salt of trimethoxy benzoic acid. The base thus obtained can be converted into salts thereof formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric aeid, tartaric acid, citric acid ete . The optically active antipodes are prepared by resolvina the racemic ketone of the Formula II EMI4.1 Acta Chim, Hung. 100, 19 1979 3 into the optically active antipodes by treatment with D tartaric acid in ethyl acetate and subjecting the dextrorotatory enantiomer thus obtained to the following. sequence of reactions. The ketone ,II3 is condensed. with methoxycarbonyl methyl phosphonic acid diethylester, the isomeric mixture thus obtained is subjected toDieckmann cyclisation and subsequently to reduction whereby the allo type III EMI4.2 and epiallo typo IV EMI5.1 dextrorotatory products are obtained. The epiallo compound IV is brominated to yield the dextrorotatory bromo dorivative , V EMI5.2 which is then reacted with a salt of trimethoxy benzoic acid to give the dextrorotatory compound ,I . Tho allo compound III is oxidized into an iminium salt which is reduced with Zn in acidic medium to yield the laevorotatory compound VI being the enantiomer of compound IV. This compound is brominated and the ,V compound. thlls obtained is reacted with a salt of trimethoxy benzoic acid to yield laevorotatory compound C ,I being the enantiomeric form of ,I3. The above method enables the preparation of both dextrorotatory and laevorotatory enantiomers of the desired product from a single and. common optically active enantiomer , II without any intermediate racemization and resolution. The same results can be achieved by carrying out the above sequence of reaction with the laevorotatory compound , II obtained. after the resolution of , II . The absolute configurations shown on theFormulae are stipulated ones. The toxicity of the product is so low that it can be neglected. The pharmacological activity was determined by the following test. Derivatives containing two alkoxy groups in the place of the methylene d.ioxy group exhibit similar activity. Phapmacological tests The berbane derivatives of the generalFormula I possess particularly significant and lasting hypotensive effect. The tests were carried.out on OFY strain male rats weighing 250 300 g. The systolic blood pressure was measured indirectly on the tails of the animals pressed down with the aid of a cuff. When the pressure of the pressing cuff attached to a mercury monometer decreased just under the systolic pressure, the sensing head of the measuring apparatus VP 101 microphone adapted for this purpose and placed on the tails of the rats signalled the appearence of arterial pulsation both in acustical and visual way oscilloscope . The systolic blood pressure was determined by observing simultaneously the manometer and the out signal. When administering the raoemic compound intraperitoneally in doses of 10 and 20 mg kg, a significant hypotensive effect was measured 3 6 hours after the administration. The effect reached.its maximum in the sixth hour, thereafter decreased.gradually and the effect could be still detected in the 48th hour. The characteristics of the hypotensive effect of reserpine used. as control are substantially the same as those of the racemic compound hypotension of approximately the same intensity and duration can be achieved by administering 2,5 mg kg of reserpine and 20 mg kg of the racemic compound, respectively. The optically active enantiomers of the compound also decrease systolic blood pressure this effect of the enantiomers does not differ significantly. The optically active enantiomers were administered in intraperitoneal doses of 20 mg kg to male rats weighing 300 and having hypertension. In the sixth hour following administration of the test compound at the maximum of the effeot the dextrotatory enantiomer , I induced a blood pressure decrease of 15,6 Hgmm average, n 6 while the laevorotatory enantiomer t , I caused a blood pressure decrease of 14,8 Hgmm average, n 6 . Contrary to reserpine, the racemic compound , I exhibits its hypotensive effect without inhibiting the functions of central nrvous system, as shown by a comparison of the effects exerted on coordination, These tests were carried out on CFLP strain female mice weighing 20 25 g by the rotating rod method A. Kovach Testing methods of experimental medical sciences A kistrletes orvostudomány vizsgáló m6dszerei Akad6mia kiad, Budapest, VI. 232 233, 1962 . In the sixth hour following administration at the period of time of the maximum of hypotensive effect theXracemic compound did not exhibit any effect on coordination, while resorpine roduced coordination to a very significatn extont Table 2 .
