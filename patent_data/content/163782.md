# Pushbutton actuator assembly.

## Abstract
A pushbutton actuator assembly for operating a switch includes a cylindrical housing 20 having an axial bore 27 therethrough, one end of the housing 20 having an en largement 21 containing a cup shaped cavity 23 com municating with the bore 27 . An elongated tubular actuator body 31 is reciprocally movable in the bore 27 . At one end of the body 31 and received in the cavity 23 is an inverted cup shaped head 36 having an end wall 37 and a cylindri cal side wall 38 . The other end of the body is bifurcated to define flexible legs 33 . Unitary with the head 36 are three elongated flexible resilient bias members 40 engageable with the bottom of the cavity 23 for resiliently biasing the actuator body 31 to a normal raised rest position.
