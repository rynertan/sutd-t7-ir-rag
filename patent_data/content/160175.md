# High impedance current source.

## Abstract
A current source circuit includes a first transistor 11 having an output current which is sensed across a resistance connected between the emitter of the first transistor 11 and the negative side of the supply voltage. A series negative feedback loop comprising transistors 13, 15 is connected between the emitter of first transistor 11 and the base of first transistor 11 . The transistors 11, 13 and 15 and the other circuit components are selected so as to result in an incremental output resistance approaching that of a cascode current source, while having a voltage drop across the circuit of substantially less than 1 volt.
