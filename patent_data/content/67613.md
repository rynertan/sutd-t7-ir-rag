## Description
DESCRIPTION THREE LAYER FILM HAVING A CORE LAYER OF LOW PRESSURES, LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE The invention relates to a multilayer film and particularly relates to a flexible co extruded film having three layers ande.g. adapted for forning a bag such as a trash bag. It is known in the prior art that in the process of melt extruding certain plastics and especially narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins a phenomena known as melt fracture can occur at high throughput rates. This problem is more severe at relatively cooler conventional melt temperatures, for conventional narrow die gaps, and for relatively high melt viscosities. It has now been found that narrow molecular weight distribution low pressure, low density polyethylene exhibits melt fracture at conventional film elt extrusion conditions at conventional throughput rates.In contrast, high pressure, low density polyethylene does not exhibit melt fracture under comparable conditions. Briefly, melt fracture is a phenomena of surface irregularities also known in the art as shark skin . It is characterized by a series of ridges perpendicular to the flow direction. In some cases, the melt fracture results in a matt appearance and the extrudate exhibits a loss of surface gloss. In extreme cases , the melt fracture can adversely affect physical properties. The occurence of melt fracture for narrow molecular weight distribution low pressure, low density polyethylene is particularly pronounced at the lower extrusion temperatures normally associated with conventional blown film extrusion. The use of a higher melt temperature could result in instabilities in the bubble which forms part of the blown film process and also presents difficulty in cooling the extrudate by conventional air cooling procedures. The elimination of melt fracture for the melt extrusion of narrow molecular weight distribution low pressure, low density polyethylene is of great importance because such polyethylene can be obtained economically and has been found to provide good physical properties in the form of a flexible film which is suitable for commercial use such as a trash bag. The narrow molecular weight distribution low pressure, low density polyethylene as used herein refers to a linear polymer having short branches and a narrow molecular weight distribution and typically exhibits a flow rate ratio of from about 25 to about 100. These polyethylenes are produced by low pressure processes such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,011,382 andEuropean Patent Application No. 0 006 110. The low pressure, low density polyethylene as used herein is preferably characterized by the appearance of melt fracture during blown film melt extrusion of a single layer film at a rate of from about 4 to about 20 pounds per hour per inch of die circunference for a die gap in the range of from about 15 to about 50 mils for a process melt temperature in the range of from about 3500F to about 4700 F. The invention relates to a flexible co extruded three layer. film comprising outer layers of high pressure, low density polyethylene and a core layer of low pressure, low density polyetylene, produced by the conventional blown film ex sion process. In particular, the film of the invention is produced by the blown film extrusion process at conventional throughput rates of from about 4 to about 25 pounds per our per inch of die at process temperature of from about 350 F to about 600 F and is free of melt fracture. The film of the invention is produced preferably by conventional blown film processes at a throughput rate of from about 4 to about 20 pounds per hour and at a process temperatures of the melt in the range of from about 350 to about 4700 F. Preferably, the film of the invention is produced by tubular extrusion and formed into a bag by slitting one side to define a bag opening and an opposite portion defines a bag bottom with the bag side edges being formed by heat sealing. Illustrative, non limiting examples of the practice of the invention are set out below. 1Twnerous other examples can readily be evolved in the light of the guiding principles and teachings contained herein. The examples given herein are intended merely to illustrate the invention and not in any sense to limit the manner in which the invention can be practiced. The parts and percentages cited herein and all through the specification unless specifically stated otherwise refer to parts by weight and percentages by weight. The following are the test criteria used. Tensile strength was measured by ASTlI D882 method A. Load at break was reported in pounds per inch of specimen width lbs inch . Tensile energy was measured by ASThi D882 method A. The energy to break the specimen is recorded as the integrated area under the load elongation curve.The unit of measure is inch pounds inch lbs and refers to a specimen one inch wide for the given thickness being measured. Ultimate elongation was measured by kSTM D882 method A and is the measure of the percent elongation of the specimen at failure. Elmendorf tear was measured by ASTh D1952 and is reported in grams gm . Spencer impact was measured by ASTM D3420 75 procedure B and is reported in grams gm . Puncture toughness is a test originated to evaluate the relative resistance of a film being punctured. There is no ASTIR standard. Basically, a 3 4 inch round steel plunger is pushed through a clamped film specimen at a speed of 20 inches per minute using a modified Instron Tester. The load to puncture of the film specimen is recorded in pounds lbs and the energy to puncture is the integrated area under the loadelongation curve and is recorded in inch pounds inch lbs .For the examples given herein, the outer layers were high pressure, low density polyethylene having a density of about 0.918 grams per cubic centimletre and a melt index of about 2.1 decagrams per minute. Melt index was determined by ASTM D 1238 Condition E measured at 1900C and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Flow index was determined by ASTM D 1238 Condition F measured at 10 times the weight used in the melt index and reported as grams per 10 ninutes. Melt Flow Ratlo is defined as the ratio of FlowIndex divided by Melt Index. In accordance with conventional practice, the examples were carried out using various known additives.Generally, additives include slip agents, colouring agents, antiblock agents, antioxicants, and the like. It has been discovered that the outer layers can be as thin as about 0.18 mil and still be effective in preventing the occurrere of melt fracture in the film of the invention. The outer layers can be as thick as about 0.35 mil or more, but economics favour a thick ness of less tan about 0.35 mils and preferably thi zer. The strength of the film of the invention arises primarily from the core layer. The low pressure, low density polyethylene used in the examples for the core layers are shown in Table I. Table I Density Melt IndexCore Layer gm cm dg minPE A 0.920 2.0PE B 0.920 1.0 PE C 0.920 3.0 PE 1 0.926 2.0 Generally, the core layer has a thickness of about three times the respective outer layers. The overall thickness of the three layer film is from about 1.0 to about 3.0 nils and preferably about 1.5 mils. Example One Tests were carried out to determine the extrusion conditions for the onset of melt fracture for various low pressure, low density polyethylenes for single layer films as a furztion of throughput rate, melt rrocess temperature, and die gap. Conventional blown film processes were used. In the art, it is conventional to state througk put rate as mass per unit time passing out of a die gap per circumferential distance for a tubular extrusion system. For PE A 2.0 d min , it was found that the onset of melt fracture occurred at a throughput rate of about 2.25 pounds per hour per inch of circanference for a die gap of 30 mils at a melt process temperature of about 4700 F. A smaller die gap and or a lower temperature would have resulted in the onset of melt fracture at even a lower throughput rate. For FE B 1.0 dg min , it was found that the onset of melt fracture occurred at a throughput rate of about 2.0 pounds per hour per inch of circumference for a die gap of 45 mils at a melt process temperature of about 4700 F. For PE C 3.0 dg min , it was found that the onset of melt fracture occurred at a throughput rate of about 3.5 pounds per hour per inch of circumference for a. die gap of 30 mils at a temperature of about 4700 F. These test show that low pressure, low density polyethylene would be unsuited for economical commercial operations for the production of single layer films by conventional methods because of the occurrence of melt fracture at throughput rates even at the low end of commercial interest. Example Two Using conventional blown film processes for a tubular die gap of about 30 mils and a core layer of PE A, two three layer films were produced. One film had outer layers each having a thickness of about 0.18 mil and a core layer having a thickness of about 1.4 mils. The throughput rate was about 5.3 pounds per hour per inch of circumference. The other film had outer layers each having a thickness of about 0.29 mil and a core layer of about 0.86 mil. The throughput rate was about 6.5 pounds per hour per ine of circumference. For both films, no melt fracture was present. Example Three Using conventional blown film processes, a three layer film was made. The core layer was PS D mnd had a thickness of about 0.98 mil. The outer layers each had a sickness of about 0.26 mil. The die gap was 30 mils and the throughput rate was about 3.5 pounds per hour per inch of circumference. No melt fracture was present. Example Four The blown film processes of the previous examples were used to produce three multilayer films of the invention. The die gap was 30 mils, the overall film thickness was about 1.5 mils, and the ratio of the layer thicknesses was 1 3 1. The core layers of the respective films A,B, and C were PE A, FE B, and FE C. For comparison, a control film having three layers with the core layer the same as the outer layers was made. Table 2 shows the measured properties of the films.

None of the films showed melt fracture. It is of particular interest that the blown film of the invention showed a surprising increase in tensile strength in the transverse direction tod whereas the tensile strength in the machine direction MD is usually the greater of the two directions for conventional high pressure low density polyethylene blown film. The strength in the transverse direction can be used in a beneficial manner to form an improved trash bag. In accordance with conventional practice, a bag can be formed from the tubular film by slitting the tubular film along its length so that the slitted portion becomes the bag opening and the opposite portion becomes the bag bottom. The two bag side edges are defined by two continuous heat seals perpendicular to the bag bottom and the bag opening. For this bag, the TD strength is in the direction extending from the bag bottom to the bag opening and thereby results in providing strength against a failure resulting from the lifting of a loaded bag from the top. It is understood that the term film is not intended to be limiting and includes sheets, tubes, straws and the like. We wish to be understood that we do not desire to be limited to the exact details of construction shown and described, for obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art.
