# Device for cutting roll tape.

## Abstract
A device 10 for cutting roll tape includes a frame 12, 14 and a serrated rotary blade 28 pivotably mounted in the frame, the rotary blade having a plurality of cutting teeth 34 formed by grooves 36 running perpendicular to the axis of the rotary blade, a flat surface 38 cut across the rotary blade, and at least one continuous groove 40, 42 at each end of the ser rated rotary blade adjacent the plurality of cutting teeth. A ser rated stationary blade 22 is pivotably mounted on the frame, the stationary blade also having a plurality of cutting teeth 44 which are meshable with the cutting teeth 34 on the rotary blade. The stationary blade 22 also hat at least one long tooth 46, 48 at each end of the stationary blade adjacent the plural ity of short cutting teeth, the long teeth 46, 48 reaching the tangency of the continuous grooves 40, 42 and riding there in. The cutting teeth 44 are sufficiently shortened to provide the desired clearance at the cutting interface. A biasing el ement includes a cam 52 , a cam following arm 54 and a spring 56 , and is arranged to bias the long teeth of the station ary blade into the continuous grooves of the rotary blade.
