## Description
Pheophorbide Derivatives and Pharmaceutical Preparations Containing ThemThe present invention relates to novel pheophorbide derivatives which are useful in cancer treatment. The com pounds according to the present invention are novel and are extremely useful in cancer treatment because of their pharmacological effects such as photo sensitivity and accumulative and destructive effects in cancer cells.Porphyrin compounds, particularly porphine derivatives obtained from hemoglobin, are known for their binding property with cancer tissues and photo dynamic characteristics. Their use in cancer treatment is now being studied.However, production of porphyrin compounds requires animal blood which is limited in supply and extensive production steps. Supply of the material animal blood, moveover, is not stable and porphine derivatives such as hematoporphyrin which are said to be the active constituent are unstable and it is extremely difficult to obtain them with high purity.It has heretofore been known that porphine derivatives of hemoglobin origin, i.e. hematoporphyrin and diacetyl hematoporphyrin, are likely to be conjugated with cancerous tissues and are photo sensitive. Endo et al have recently found that 10 hydroxy pheophorbide is carcinostatic Jap. Pat. Appln. Laid openNo. Sho 57 185220 . This application discloses that pheophorbide and pyropheophorbide also have the same activities. Although these compounds are photo sensitive because they are porphyrin related compounds , they have no selectively accumulative effect in cancer cells. No data on their affinity to cancer cells are found in references nor is there any description concerning the differences in selective accumulation in cancer cells among the listed compounds other than the calculated results on the tumor suppression rate after administration of the substance and laser irradiation.Yori et al reported on the bactericidal effect of ethylenediamine hydrochloride of pheophorbide Jap. Pat. Appln.Laid open No. Sho 58 981 . This application relates to an antibacterial agent comprising water soluble phorbine derived from pheophorbide by converting the same into ethylenediamine hydrochloride.Processes for synthesizing chlorophyll dimers are disclosed in the literature M.R. Wasielewski et al, C.A. 86, 68532f 1977 , C.A. 88 148988rC1978 and S.G. Boxer et al,J.A.C.S., 1976,,5406 . Also disclosed in references is the synthesis of compounds such as 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophytin M.R. Wasielewski et aL, Tetrahedron Letters, 1043 1978 and 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy 1 O methoxy methylpheophorbide H.Scheer et awl., Tetrahedron, 28, 5839 1972 . However these substances are different from the compounds of the invention.Moreover, the aim of the authors of said articles was to synthesize the compounds as a part of their study in elucidating the meachanism of photo synthesis in order to obtain compounds having an W absorption profile more Similar to that of chlorophyll P 700. The latter substance is the result of the study in which various related derivatives were synthesized to determine their absolute configuration, to investigate the influence of reaction conditions on yield and to publish data obtained from analyses and measurements by various devices. These references do not discuss physiological activities of the compounds on cancerous tissues which are the main object of the present invention.The present inventors have long been engaged in the study of chlorophyll related compounds and established a highly economical process for separating pheophorbide using photo synthesized organisms which are available in a stable and inexpensive supply. Jap. Pat. Appln. Laidopen No. Sho 58 69884 .It is the object of the present invention to provide novel pheophorbide derivatives having more potent physiological activities t han said porphines derived from blood. This object is achieved by the invention.The subject matter of the invention are novel pheophorbide derivatives having various functional groups expressed by general formula I and their dimers expressed by general formula II hereinafter referred to as the present invention substances , excluding pheophorbide and pyropheophorbide EMI3.1 wherein R1 representsEMI4.1 EMI4.2 R2 represents CH3, CHO or CH2OH, R3 represents C O, OH or OCOCH3, R4 represents H,COOCH3, COOCH2CH2OH COOCH2CH2OCOCH3 or COONH residue of amino acid and R5 represents COOH, COONa or COOCH3.Preferred compounds of the invention are 9 desoxo 9hydroxy pheophorbide derivatives and alkaline salts thereof represented by the general formula Ia EMI4.3 wherein R2 represents CH3 or CH2OH, R6 represents H or Ac, and R7 represents H or an alkali metal such as Na and K.Results of elemental analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance absorption of 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide which is one of the preferred compounds of the invention are as follows Formula C35H38N405Elementary analysis calcd.

It has so far been unknown that the phorbine related compounds had such strong physiological activities. The inventors often observed this fact during the course of their study, which is surprising as, for example, no specific activities against cancer were found in the raw material of the invention substances, that is, pheophorbide and its alkaline salts and methyl pheophorbide. The invention will now be further explained with respect to the drawing in whichFig. 1 and 2 are graphs showing the affinity of compounds according to the invention to cancer cells as measured by N2 pulsed laser spectrofluoro metry Fig. 3 and 4 are graphs showing the destructive effect of said compounds on cancer cells as measured by biochemiluminescence in a single photon counter system.Pharmacological activities of the present invention substances will now be explained. The present invention substances accumulate selectively in cancer tissues and only slowly excrete therefrom. When irradiated with light, they react and produce singlet oxygen having a strong oxidizing effect to thereby destroy cancer cells. As the present invention substances are readily excreted from normal organs and cells, cancer can thus be treated without damage to normal cells. It is possible to treat not only the cancer projecting on the surface but also small cancer lesion in the mucous epithelium which is difficult to find and abnormal cells in precancer state.As for effects on cancer, most of porphines,except for a very few substances, show no selective affinity to cancer cells although they are photo sensitive. Absence of selectivity leads to destruction of normal cells as well as cancer cells.In view of the above facts, there has been proposed a combined use of several porphines having selective affinity.The present invention substances are of great utility as they are provided with all the properties mentioned above i.e., affinity to cancer cells, photo sensitivity, destructive effect on cancer . These substances can be used not only singly but in combination.The process for preparing the compounds according to the present invention will now be described. Roughly, there are two ways of preparing the invention compounds having the general formula I. According to one process pheophobide 1 is treated with hydrobromic acid to obtain 2 desethenyl 2 1 hydroxyethyl pheophorbide 2 , which is then reduced to obtain 2 desethenyl 2 1 hydroxy ethyl 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide 3 . 3 is acetylated to obtain diacetylate 4 . The reactions can be expressed by the following chemical formula EMI8.1 In partical application of the present invention, 1 is dissolved in hydrobromic acid acetic acid, reacted and neutralized to obtain 2 . 2 is reacted using a suitable reducing agent such as NaBH4 to obtain the product 3 .Diacetylated product 4 can be obtained from 3 by reaction with acetic anhydride pyridine in the usual way.According to another process for preparing the compounds of the general formula I, methylpheophorbide 5 is esterexchanged with ethylene glycol to obtain ethylene glycol mono 10b methyl pheophorbate 6 , and 5 is ester exchanged with phenylalanine t butyl ester to obtain N phenylalanine t butyl ester 1Ob methylpheo phorbidamide 7 . 6 and 7 are subjected to acid hydrolysis to obtain ethylene glycol mono lOb methyl pheophorbate 8 and N phenylalanine lOb methyl pheophorbidamide 9 .The reactions can be expressed by the following chemical formula EMI10.1 Hydroxides, reduced derivatives or acetylates of 8 and 9 may be produced by subjecting said esters of pheo phorbide to hydrobromic acid treatment, reduction or acetylation as mentioned above.In practical application of the present invention, 5 is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as xylene or DMF, ethylene glycol is added and the mixture is heated and reacted to obtain 6 . Alternatively, phenylalanine t butyl ester is added in place of ethylene glycol, heated and reacted to obtain 7 . The resultant product 6 is reacted with 50 HzSO4 and the product 7 withCF3COOH respectively to obtain 8 and 9 .The dimers of the present invention having the general formula II are obtained by condensating 8 with 1 through ester exchange to obtain ethylene glycol di lOb pheophorbate 10 . The reaction can be expressed by the following formula EMI11.1 Said pheophorbide dimer k can be subjected to hydrobromic acid treatment, reduction or acetylation in the same manner as mentioned above to produce hydroxides, reduced derivatives or acetylates of X, respectively.In practical application of the present invention, 8 may be dissolved in a suitable solvent such as DMF orDMA. Then 1 is added and the mixture is heated and reacted to obtain 10 .As a still another process or preparing the present invention substances, it is possible to form the hydroxide or reduced derivatives of methyl pheophorbide 5 prior to condensation by ester exchange, and obtain preferable results. Any combination of reactions other than those mentioned above may also be employed so long as they include hydroxidization, hydrolysis and ester exchange reactions. It is also preferable but not essential to add a suitable antioxidant or solvent and to heat the reaction system. Although pheophorbide is used as the starting material, pheophorbide a,b,c, pyropheophorbide and pheophytin may also be used. The invention is, however, not limited to those so long as the material is obtained from a photo synthesized substance.The preferred compounds of general formula Ia can be obtained by reducing pheophorbide 1 to produce 9 desoxo9 hydroxy pheophorbide 11 . The reaction can be expressed by the following chemical formula EMI12.1 EMI13.1 In practical application of the present invention, 1 is dissolved in a suitable solvent, i.e. methanol, and reacted with a suitable reducing agent such as Nabs4. A preferable result can be. obtained by another preparation method of the present invention substances, wherein pheophytin or methyl pheophorbide is reduced in advance in the first step and the reaction product, 9 desoxo9 hydroxy pheophytin or 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy methyl pheophorbide is hydrolyzed in the second step.A similarly preferable result can be obtained by sill another process pheophorbide obtained through acid hydrolysis of pheophytin is similarly reduced ot obtain 11 , or 11 is acetylated produce 9 desoxo 9 acetyloxy pheophorbide 12 because when 12 is an alkaline salt, it is released prior to 11 . Any combination of reactions other than those mentioned above may also be employed so long as they include hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation. It is also preferable but not essential to add a suitable antioxidant or solvent and to heat the reaction system. Although methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, pyridine,etc.as solvents and Na2S203, Na2S204, ascorbic acid, etc.as reducing agents may be employed in preparing the present invention substances, the invention is not restricted to these solvents and reducing agents.Table I illustrates data on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance absorption spectrum of the present invention substances.EMI14.1 EMI15.1 SEP Table SEP I SEP SEP ppm tb SEP I SEP II SEP III SEP V SEP VI SEP VII SEP VIII SEP IX SEP X tb Mw SEP 592 SEP 610 SEP 612 SEP 606 SEP 636 SEP 795 SEP 622 SEP 739 SEP 1182 tb alpha H SEP 9.05 SEP 8.85 SEP 8.70 SEP 9.16 SEP 9.00 SEP 9.07 SEP 9.02 SEP 9.08 SEP 9.12 tb ss SEP H SEP 9.22 SEP 9.25 SEP 9.00 SEP 9.36 SEP 9.31 SEP 9.30 SEP 9.29 SEP 9.32 SEP 9.19 tb SEP H SEP 8.43 SEP 8.29 SEP 8.32 SEP 8.53 SEP 8.42 SEP 8.50 SEP 8.43 SEP 8.48 SEP 8.40 tb 1 SEP CH3 SEP 3.26 SEP 3.25 SEP 3.15 SEP 3.30 SEP 3.22 SEP 3.25 SEP 3.38 SEP 3.26 SEP 3.37 tb 2 SEP CH CH2 SEP 7.72 SEP SEP SEP 7.83 SEP 7.70 SEP 7.73 SEP 7.71 SEP 7.72 SEP 7.80 tb SEP 6.05 SEP SEP SEP 6.15 SEP 6.10 SEP 6.10 SEP 6.10 SEP 6.10 SEP 6.15 tb SEP 5.95 SEP SEP SEP 6.06 SEP 5.93 SEP 5.98 SEP 6.01 SEP 5.95 SEP 5.99 tb 3 SEP CH3 SEP 3.00 SEP 3.05 SEP 3.00 SEP 3.04 SEP 2.95 SEP 2.99 SEP 3.17 SEP 2.98 SEP 3.14 tb 4b SEP CH3 SEP 1.62 SEP 1.63 SEP 1.68 SEP 1.60 SEP 1.53 SEP 1.58 SEP 1.66 SEP 1.58 SEP 1.68 tb 5 SEP CH3 SEP 3.57 SEP 3.43 SEP 3.22 SEP 3.60 SEP 3.52 SEP 3.52 SEP 3.62 SEP 3.52 SEP 3.59 tb 7 SEP H SEP 4.13 SEP 4.2 SEP 4.1 SEP 4.16 SEP 4.2 SEP 4.4 SEP 4.2 SEP 4.3 SEP 4.2 tb 7a,b SEP CH2CH2 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 SEP 2 3 tb 7c SEP CH3 SEP SEP SEP SEP 3.56 SEP 3.60 SEP 3.61 SEP SEP 3.60 SEP 8 SEP H SEP 4.40 SEP 4.7 SEP 4.4 SEP 4.44 SEP 4.5 SEP 4.55 SEP 4.4 SEP 4.53 SEP 4.43 tb 8 SEP CH3 SEP 1.86 SEP 1.90 SEP 1.71 SEP 1.81 SEP 1.80 SEP 1.84 SEP 1.85 SEP 1.82 SEP 1.85 tb 9 SEP H SEP SEP SEP 6.69 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 10 SEP H SEP 6.17 SEP 6.11 SEP 6.13 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.21 SEP 6.13 SEP 6.22 SEP 6.15 SEP 6.24 tb 10b SEP CH3 SEP 3.85 SEP 3.88 SEP 3.42 SEP 3.88 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 10b SEP CH2CH2 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 3.93 SEP SEP 4.15 SEP SEP 10b SEP CH2 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 4.2 tb 10b SEP OBut SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 1.40 SEP SEP SEP 10b SEP CH2 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 7.2 SEP SEP 7.2 SEP As mentioned above, the present invention utilizes photosynthesized substances as the raw material which are inexpensive and stably supplied.

A N2 Pulsed Laser Spectro Fluorometry Experiment 1Five mg of the test drug sodium 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide diluted in physiological saline 1 ml was administered 1 ml to golden hamsters 5 each for a group 14 21 days after transplatation of nitrosoamineinduced cancer cells of the pancreas, after which cancer cells and other organs were removed. N2 pulsed laser N2 337 nm, 2 ns 400 1000 nm was irradiated to each organ thus obtained to measure N2 pulsed laser spectro fluorometry. The result is shown in Fig. 1. N2 pulsed laser spectro fluorometryof each removed organ was measured 24 hours and 48hours afterwards to investigate the wavelengths of 600 to 900 nm based on the peak wavelength of NADH of 470 nm.Fig. 1 shows that though sodium 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide was generally found in organs after 24 hours, it had markedly accummulated in cancer cells alone but not in other cells after 48 hours.As is obvious from the above result, sodium 9 desoxo 9hydroxy pheophorbide was proved to have remarkable selective affinity to cancer cells.Experiment 2Golden hamsters 5 per one group 14 21 days after transplantation of nitrosoamine induced cancer cells of the pancreas were administered 5 mg each of sodium 2 desethenyl 2 1 hydroxyethyl pheophorbide sodium salt of 2 , sodium 2 desethynyl 2 1 hydroxyethyl 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide sodium salt 3 , sodium 2 desethenyl 2 1 acetyloxyethyl 9 desoxo 9 acetyloxy pheophorbide sodium salt of 4 , sodium ethylene glycol mono lOb pheophorbate sodium salt of 8 , disodium ethylene glycol di l0b pheophorbate sodium salt of 10 and sodium N phenylalanine 10b methyl pheophorbid amide sodium salt of 9 respectively diluted with physiological saline 1 ml .Cancer cells and other organs were removed, irradiated with N2 pulsed laser N2, 337 nm, 2 ns 400 1000 nm to measure N2 pulsed laser spectro fluorometry. Using the NADH peak wavelength of 470 nm as the reference, wavelengths in the range of from 600 900 nm were studied.Fig. 2 shows that these products showed marked accumulation in cancer cells 24 hours after administration, but left no trace in other cells.Similar tests were conducted on other products and the results are shown in ableII. Various organs were removed 24 hours after administration and their N2 pulsed laser spectro fluorometry was measured. Using the NADH peak wavelength of 470 nm as the reference, the wavelengths were calculated and shown in Table II..As is evident from the result above, these phorbine related compounds have a marked selective affinity to cancer cellsB Biochemical luminescence by single photoncounterExperiment 3Sodium 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide dissolved in physiological saline of respective concentrations 25 g 2 ml, 50 g 2 ml, 100 g 2 ml was added to leukemicMolt 4 Cell 1 x 107 Cells and the resultant product was incubated for 24 hours at 37 OC. Each incubated cell thus obtained was irradiated with laser He Ne gas, 630 nm, 10 min, 20 mW and trace biochemiluminescence was measured by single photoncounter system.Intensity of biochemiluminescene substantially corresponds to the degree of destructive effect on cancer cells and thus by studying the biochemicluminescene by single photoncounter system, it is possible to predict the destructive effect on cancer cells.Fig. 3 shows the intensity of biochemiluminescene and the destructive effect on cancer cells after laser irra dilation. It is seen from Fig. 3 that more than 95 of the cancer cells were destroyed when the subject substance in the amount of 100 ssg 2 ml was used.The foregoing result shows that sodium 9 desoxo 9 hydroxy pheophorbide has intense photo sensitivity and remarkable destructive effect on cancer cells. Experiment 4 7Leukemic Molt 4 cell 1 x 10 cells was added with physiological saline containing sodium 2 desethenyl2 1 hydroxyethyl pheophorbide sodium salt of 2 in respective concentrations 25 ssg 2 ml, 50 pug 2 ml, 100 pg 2 ml and then incubated 370C, 24 hours . Incubated cells each were irradiated with laser He He gas, 630 nm, 10 min, 20 mW to investigate generation of biochemiluminescene by single photoncounter system by measuring biochemiluminescence. The intensity of biochemiluminescence by singel photoncounter system substantially corresponds to the degree of destruction of the cancer cells. Therefore, by observing generation of biochemiluminescence by single photoncounter system, destruction of cancer cells by be predicted. Fig. 4 shows the degree of biochemiluminescence and the destruction of cancer cells after laser irradiation.The result indicates that when 100 g 2 ml of a test substance was used, more than 95 of the cancer cells were destroyed.As is evident from the results shown in Fig. 4, phorbine related compounds are highly photo sensitive and display a marked destructive effect on cancer cells.The foregoing exper iments A and B together prove that the present invention substances have a marked affinity to cancer cells, remarkable photo sensitivity, and destructive effect on cancer cells.
