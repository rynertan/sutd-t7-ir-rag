# METHOD FOR THE TREATMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND OTHER CONCRETE WASTES

## Abstract
A method of treatment of concrete wastes, especially, but not exclusively, radioactive concrete wastes resulting from the demolition of nuclear reactors which enables airborne dust to be confined rapidly and which ensures that dust on the surface of the concrete rubble adheres well to it requires the taking up of the dust in a liquid medium, usually an aqueous alkali metal silicate solution, which has the ability to wet and bind the dust particles together and set to a cohesive mass under ambient conditions.
