## Description
This invention relates to a novel purified forms of glycoprotein found in the cell surface membrane of cells infected with human T cell leukemia virus, and to an assay for detecting in a biological specimen the presence of an antibody to the antigenic determinants present in said glycoproteins. The human T cell leukemia virus HTLV is known to be closely associated with a particular type of human leukemia, the T cell type in adults. It has also been shown that all people whose bodies contain antibodies to this virus are apparently latently infected with the virus. Essex, J.N.C.I., Vol. 69, 981 5 1982 . The major core proteins of the virus have been studied and an immunofluorescent assay procedure for antibodies to the infected cells has been described which involves fixing cells from a cell line of infected human cells such as MT1 or MT2, contacting the fixed cells with the test serum to be assayed, and determining whether bonding of the serum to the cell surface has occurred by subsequently contacting with a fluorescent labelled antibody to human IgG. Hinuma et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci., Vol. 78, 6476 6480 1981 . This assay is tedious and difficult to use because only 1 to 5 of the fixed cells display the necessary antigenic characteristics. It has also been proposed to employ a somewhat analogous cell surface immunofluorescent assay in which a culture of infected cells is incubated with test serum, then with fluorescent labelled rabbit antibody to human IgG to determine whether bonding of serum to cells has occurred. Robert Guroff et al., Science, Vol. 215, 975 978 1982 . A radioimmunoassay for antibodies to p24 and p19, two of the core proteins of HTLV, has also been described. Posner et al., J.Exp.Med., Vol. 154, 333 344 1981 . However, this assay fails to produce positive results for all individuals who have been exposed to the infecting virus and are therefore at risk, but who do not have detectable levels of antibodies to these two antigens. It has now been found that particular polypeptides or glycoproteins present on the cell surface of human T cells infected with HTLV when purified and isolated contain an antigenic determinant or determinants which provide a high degree of sensitivity and immunospecificity for antibody to human cells infected with HTLV, to human T cell leukemia cells, and or to HTLV. Consequently, the substantially pure glycoproteins or their unglycosylated moleties are useful as a diagnostic tool for assaying biological specimens to determine whether they contain cells which have been infected by HTLV. Other polypeptides containing immunologically cross reactive antigenic determinants are useful for the same purpose. By polypeptides containing immunologically cross reactive antigenic determinants is meant polypeptides having in common antigenic determinants with which a given antibody will react. Such other polypeptides include the unglycosylated moieties of the glycoproteins. Other useful polypeptides or proteins, which have the necessary immunogenic determinants, include synthetic polypeptides. They also include antibodies or fragments thereof which are anti idiotypic towards the active determinant or determinants on the glycoprotein of the invention. It has recently been shown that anti idiotypic monoclonal antibodies can induce an immune response against, and protect against infection by infectious organisms carrying antigenic determinants which are the same or substantially the same as those on the anti idiotypic antibodies Fields et al., Nature, 300 19 23 1982 Sacks et al., J.Exp.Med. 4 1108 1119 1982 . It has also been shown that anti idiotypic reagents are useful as diagnostic tools for the detection of antigens carrying sites which are immunologically cross reactive with those on the antibodies Potocnjak et al., Science 215 1637 1639 1982 herein incorporated by reference . Thus, an assay for HTLV could be carried out with the aid of a anti idiotypic antibody or immunologically active fragment thereof which carries an antigenic site or sites thereon which are immunologically similar to the antigenic site or sites on the glycoprotein of the invention. Such anti idiotypic antibodies can be raised against first antibodies having specificity against the antigenic sites on the glycoprotein of the invention i.e. the anti idiotypic antibodies are anti antibodies . Preferably monoclonal anti idiotypic antibodies are used. An assay for HTLV infection is important because the virus can be readily transferred from the peripheral blood leukocytes of antibody positive people to leukocytes of antibody negative people when the two are cultivated together. Popovic et al., Science, Vol. 219, 856 859 1983 . Consequently, it appears that there is great risk of infection involved in whole blood transfusions when the transfused blood contains infected cells. In addition, the assay is of importance because biological specimens from individuals exhibiting acquired immunodeficient syndrome AIDS also give a positive test for antibodies to the antigenic determinant of the novel glycoprotein, thus facilitating diagnosis of that disease. Consequently, the invention also embraces the method of assaying a biological specimen for the presence of antibody to HTLV infected cells which comprises incubating said specimen with a polypeptide having an antigenic determinant or determinants immunologically cross reactive with those of a glycoprotein having a molecular weight of approximately 61,000 68,000 daltons, of which approximately 46 48,000 daltons is the unglycosylated moiety, which glycoprotein occurs on the cell surface of cells infected with HTLV, and determining whether or not an immunocomplex is formed between said antibody and said polypeptide. The invention also embraces a method of assaying a biological specimen for the presence of antigenic determinant or determinants immunologically cross reactive with the determinants of the glycoprotein of molecular weight 61,000 68,000 daltons. The determinants to be may occur on the stated glycoprotein itself or on other polypeptides. They may be in free circulation in the body fluids or in lymphocytes. The assay can be carried out by known immunoassay methods, using antibodies, monoclonal or polyvalent, having immune reactivity with the antigenic determinants found on the stated glycoproteins. For example competitive immunoassays or immunometric sandwich assays can be used. The glycoprotein of the present invention has a molecular weight of approximately 61,000 68,000 daltons as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS gel electrophoresis and is soluble in SDS buffer consisting of 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M Tris hydrochloride pH 7.2, 1 Triton X 100, 1 sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 sodium dodecylsulfate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X 100 is a nonionic detergent octylphenoxy polyethoxy 9 10 ethanol . The unglycosylated moiety of the 61,000 68,000 d glycoprotein has a molecular weight of approximately 46,000 48,000 daltons and contains substantially the same antigenic determinant or determinants as does the glycoprotein itself. The glycoprotein can be obtained from HTLV infected cells. A variety of cell lines have been prepared, which are permanently and persistently infected with HTLV among them can be mentioned MJ, C5 MJ, C91PL, and HUT 102. It may be that the exact sizes of the novel glycoprotein is slightly different in different lines however, the common immunologically cross reactive portion of the glycoprotein is the same regardless of cell line, since it is a protein induced by HTLV. Thus, any cell which harbors the virus may be an appropriate source for the novel glycoprotein. In order to obtain the protein from any infected cells carrying the virus, the cells are metabolically labelled e.g. with ³⁵S methionine and immunoprecipitated with antisera obtained from HTLV infected subjects. The novel glycoprotein can then be detected and isolated by gel electrophoresis. By HTLV as used in the present specification and claims it is meant to include the virus generically. Thus any and all forms, subtypes, or variations of the virus are included. For example, the glycoprotein is present at the cell surfaces of the human T cell leukemia cell cultures MJ, C5 MJ, C91PL and HUT 102. A specimen of MJ and of C5 MJ have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection on April 26, 1983 as ATCC Nos. CRL 8294 and CRL 8293, respectively. The glycoprotein can readily be separated from the cells of these cell lines by lysis thereof and SDS gel electrophoresis. The purified and isolated glycoprotein or any antigen immunologically cross reactive therewith can be employed as a standard antigen in any conventional assay procedure for detection in biological specimens of the presence of antibodies specific thereto, hence of the presence in the specimen of cells infected with HTLV and or symptomatic of AIDS. The antibodies specific to such HTLV antigens are not found in patients suffering from diseases such as hepatitis which are not accompanied by HTLV infection. The glycoprotein or polypeptides immunologically cross reactive therewith can be labelled by conventional procedures with ¹²⁵I or ³⁵S or ³H for use in radioimmunoassay, with fluorescein for fluorescent immunoassay, with enzyme for enzyme immunoassay or with biotin, for biotin avidin linked assays. It can be employed, labelled or unlabelled as desired, in competitive immunoassays, as well as in double antibody assays using two antibodies, either of the idiotype anti idiotype variety or more particularly of the second antibody type using an anti Fc antibody, or other assays. Alternatively, the novel glycoprotein or polypeptides immunologically cross reactive therewith could be immobilized on an insoluble phase, such as an insoluble resin, and detection of the anti glycoprotein antibodies is carried out by measuring their binding to the insoluble phase. Insoluble phases also include latex particles, which, when coated with the novel glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides and subjected to anti glycoprotein antibody, will agglutinate. Yet other insoluble phases include test tubes, vials, titration wells, and the like, to which the novel glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptide can be bound, and antibody thereto detected by double antibody techniques or Protein A dependent techniques. The assay for antibody to HTLV may utilize the glycoprotein or glycoproteins of m.w. 61 68,000, in crude form, and is not limited to using the protein in substantially pure form. In one embodiment, the assay for the presence of antibodies against HTLV may include detection of additional antibodies in the specimen such as those against HTLV core proteins p19, p24 or a mixture of both of the latter. In this embodiment the method comprises incubating the specimen with a reagent comprising 1 glycoprotein of the invention i.e. 61,000 68,000 or immunocross reactive polypeptides and, optionally, 2 HTLV core proteins p24 or p19 or both, and determining whether or not an immunocomplex is formed between antibodies in the specimen and the reagent. The elements necessary for carrying out the diagnostic methodology described hereinbefore may be present in a kit. Such kit comprises a carrier being compartmentalized to receive therein one or more containers, each of said containers comprising one or more elements necessary to carry out the tests. For example, the first container may contain the purified glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides in detectably labelled or in insolubilized form. A second container may comprise anti IgG antibody, polyclonal or monoclonal, useful in double antibody binding assay, or elements needed for detection of the label on the glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides e.g. chromogenic substrates . Additional containers may comprise varying amounts of glycoprotein or its immunologically cross reactive polypeptides which can be used to prepare a standard curve into which experimental results can be interpolated. The materials may be present in the kit by themselves, in solution, freeze dried, or in admixture with other inert materials, such as inert proteins, and the like. The biological specimens tested may include blood, serum, lymphocytes, urine, tissues, saliva, feces, and the like. Of particular interest is the screening of blood in blood banks, to assure that the blood is not contaminated with HTLV. Screening of blood derived products, such as vaccines, can also be done by the methods of the invention. The following specific examples are intended to illustrate more fully the nature of the invention without acting as a limitation upon its scope. The beads were then immersed in a sample buffer 0.1 M Cleland s reagent, 2 sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.08 M Tris hydrochloride pH 6.8, 10 glycerol, and 0.2 Bromphenol Blue and subjected to boiling at 100 C. for 2 minutes to elute proteins from the beads and to dissociate complexes. The spots of purified and isolated 61,000 68,000 molecular weight glycoprotein appeared prominently in all of the columns of serum a , but in none of those of serum b . In contrast, the core proteins p19 and p24 failed to appear in all samples of serum a . Appearance of the glycoprotein in the unknown sera c indicated the presence in the sera of cells infected with HTLV. Sera from individuals exhibiting AIDS also exhibited prominent evidence of antibodies to the 61,000 68,000 MW glycoprotein in this procedure. Similar results have been obtained by substituting for the labelled glycoproteins of paragraph A, either of those of paragraphs B or C. There could also be substituted for it the labelled unglycosylated moiety of paragraph D, in which case the purified and isolated labelled moiety appears in the gel column at a location corresponding to molecular weight 46,000 48,000. Unlabelled glycoprotein and unlabelled unglycosylated moiety can be obtained by omitting the labelling steps in the foregoing procedures. Similar results have been obtained by substituting cell lines C91PL or HUT 102 in place of MJ or C5MJ. Similar analysis was carried out with ³⁵S cysteine labeled glycoprotein having molecular weight of approximately 67,000 d. Cysteine residues were detected at positions 6, 7 and 21 when the first 22 NH₂ terminal residues were analyzed. This shows that this glycoprotein is also encoded, at least in part, by the same NH₂ terminal end of the
