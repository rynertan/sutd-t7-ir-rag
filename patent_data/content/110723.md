# Method of preparing polyimide foams with blowing agents and products thereof.

## Abstract
There is disclosed the use of solid blowing agents to gener ate polyimide foams which have low densities and identation load deflection ILD values and a relatively open cellular struc ture with larger cell sizes. The preferred method includes the steps of preparing, foaming, and curing a precursor containing at least one alkyl ester of 3,3 ,4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid at least one of a meta or para substituted aromatic diamine and a heterocyclic diamine and a solid blowing agent. Preferred heterocyclic and aromatic diamines are selected from the group consisting of 2,6 diaminopyridine 3,5 diaminopyridine 3,3 diaminodiphenyl sulfone 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide 3,3 diaminodiphenyl ether 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether meta phenylene diamine para phenylene diamine p,p methylene dianiline 2,6 diamino toluene 2,4 diamino toluene. Preferred blowing agents include toluene sulfonyl hydrazide p,p oxybis benzenesulfonyl hydrazide azodicarbonamide p toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide hydrazole dicarboxylate sodium bicarbonate benzene sulfonyl hydrazide triphenyl phosphate sodium borate borate acid benzoic acid.
