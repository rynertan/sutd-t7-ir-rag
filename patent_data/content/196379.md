## Description
BUILDING PANEL This invention relates to a building panel. This invention more particularly relates to a building panel, suitable for walls and roofs, which are formed from inner and outer steel sheets or panels with insulation bëtween thèm. Steel and other metal panels are commonly used for cladding the exteriors of buildings. One known construction technique uses separate interior and exterior panels. This permits a layer of insulation to be provided between the interior and exterior panels. After the basic structural steel skeleton has been put up, the liner or interior panels are secured to the structural steel. Then, insulation is applied to the liner panels.For the exterior panels, sub girts, which are typically of Z section, have then to be secured to the liner panels and via the liner panels to the structural steel frame. Finally, the exterior panels can be secured to these sub girts. Such an assembly technique, whilst producing an acceptable cladding, is relatively complicated, and consequently requires a large amount of labor Also, care hays tobe taken to ensure that all the various elements fit together properly, and that the finished cladding is weather proof. Another known type of wall and roof system utilizes insulated combination panels. Each panel is a combination of an exterior panel and an interior panel, which are bounded together by a thick layer of foam between them. The foam serves both a structural function and as insulation. After on site assembly of the steel frame or skeleton, assembly of a wall or roof is quicker and simpler, since each panel provides the functions of the numerous different components used in other constructions. However, the equipment needed for the manufacture of these combination panels is complex and requires a large capital outlay. According to the present invention there is provided a building panel, formed from a single sheet of material and comprising an inner panel portion an outer panel portion and a web portion extending between the inner and outer panel portions, whereby, in use, a surface can be formed from a plurality of said panels secured adjacent one another with adjacent inner and outer panel portions overlying one another. The panels just defined can be used to form a wall or roof cladding on a support frame, or can by themselves form a structural or load bearing wall. Preferably, the web portion is so dimensioned as to space the inner and outer panels or panel portions from one another in a direction normal to the plane of the cladding or wall, sufficiently to permit insulation to be placed between the inner and outer panel portions. The panel of the present invention provides in one unit the inner panel, the outer panel and the subgirts of known systems. For example, after assembly of the steel frame, a side of a building can be clad quickly and simply. If required, a separate inner panel portion of a panel defined above can be separated from the exterior panel portion and secured to the frame.The web portion can either be left attached to one of the inner and exterior panel portions, or it can be disposed of. The inner panel portion is then secured adjacent one edge of the side of the building. Insulation is placed on this inner panel portion and secured in position. A complete panel is secured in position adjacent to the already present inner panel portion. The inner panel portion of this next panel is secured to the structural steel, and the exterior or outer panel portion is placed over the insulation and secured to the already present inner panel portion.A second strip of insulation can then be located on the inner panel portion of this first complete panel. This cycle can be completed across the width or depth of the building, depending on the orientation of the panels, until the entire side of the building is covered. Thus, in effect, as each panel is laid, it simultaneously provides an outer panel portion for one part of the surface, an inner panel portion for another part of the surface, and, in effect, a subgirt which would have to be provided separately in a known construction. If required to finish the surface, an exterior panel portion can be separated from a panel and secured adjacent another edge of the side of the building. The panel of the present invention can be applied to any part of a building, including both walls and roof surfaces. In the case of surfaces which require two or more rows of panels, it is convenient if all the rows of panels are laid simultaneously. Thus, one would first secure an appropriate number of inner panel portions to one edge of the surface, with the inner panel portions disposed end to end, and overlapping one another as required. After applying insulation, and equivalent curter of panels could be secured end to end in position covering these inner panel portions, and so on across the surface. The present invention also provides a building panel, formed from a single sheet of material and comprising an outer panel portion a web portion extending generally perpendicularly from the outer panel portion and a mounting portion extending from the web portion, and of smaller width than the outer panel portionr whereby, in use, an exterior surface can be formed from a plurality of the panels secured adjacent one another, with their mounting portions secured to a support structure and with the outer panel portions forming the exterior surface. In this case, no inner panel portion is provided.After assembly, spaces defined by the panels are accessible from the interior. One can then fill these with insulation if required. A suitable layer of decorative inner wall panels can then be mounted. The mounting portion can be any portion that enables the panels to be secured to the underlying support. Usually, the underlying support will be a steel framework, and the mounting portions can then be flat bottomed channel sections, through which screws, bolts etc can be fastened. In this variant of the invention, as no inner panel portion is provided, one does not have to modify the panel for mounting at the corners of a building. This can simplify assembly. The insulation used can be any known insulation, such as fiberglass, or mineral fiber. Foam insulation can be used, and Sn this case it is conveniently applied btt injection after the panels have been secured in position. Various configurations can be used for the web portion.Preferably, it is designed to minimize thermal loss, and for this purpose it should have as low a thermal conductivity as possible.The web portion can be provided with large cut outs leaving short limb portions extending between the inner and outer panel portions.The limb portions can either extend normal to the inner and outer panel portions, or at an angle thereto. Alternatively, or as well, the web portion can be corrugated, The length of the limb portions can be varied, and amongst other things will be determined by the overall depth of the web portion and the orientation of the limb portions. To strenthen the limb portions and increase their buckling resistance they can be provided with folded edges. The use of a continuous web portion with no openings has the advantage that in the finished cladding there is no direct passage for air or moisture. Air or moisture can only travel between the interior and exterior by passing through the joint between two panels and then diagonally across the space between these two panels and then between the other joint between these two panels. This provides for secure weatherproofing, as faults have to develop in both joints before moisture can travel between the inside and the outside of the structure. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by example, to the accompanying drawings which show an embodiment of the present invention and in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of part of a cladding formed from a panel according to the present invention, in section Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a cross section through an alternative embodiment of a panel according to the present invention Figure 3 shows a cross section through a cladding formed from panels according to the present invention and Figure 4 shows a perspective view of a third embodiment of the panel. With reference to Figure 1, there is shown a cross section through one panel 1 according to the present invention, and part of a cross section through a second panel 3. Since all the panels are similar, the details of each panel will be described with particular reference to panel 1. The panel 1 has an inner panel portion 10, a web portion 20 and an exterior panel portion 30, which are continuous with one another. The inner panel portion 10 comprises a main rectangular sheet 11. A free edge strip 12 of the inner panel portion 10 is continuous with the rectangular sheet 11 and is perpendicular to it For coupling purposes, a channel 13 is provided in the edge strip 12. The channel 13 is of generally trapezoidal cross section. The web portion 20 comprises edge strips 21 and 22, and extending between the edge strips 21, 22 cross pieces 23.Consequently, apertures 24 are defined between the edge strips 21 and 22 and the cross pieces 23. In the edge strip 22, which is continuous with the rectangular sheet 11, a channel 25 is provided for coupling purposes. Again, this channel 25 is of generally trapezoidal cross section. To reinforce the panel 1, gussets 14 are provided between the inner panel portion 10 and the web portion 2off. The outer panel portion 30 essentially comprises a single rectangular sheet. Along two opposite edges of the outer portion, there are provided channels 31 and 32, for coupling purposes. The channel 31 is located immediately adjacent the left hand edge of the outer panel portion 30 as viewed in figure 1. The channel 32 is located adjacent the web portion 20. Again, both these channels 31 and 32 are of generally trapezoidal cross section. The channels 31 and 32 are complimentary to one another, and comprise respective first and second coupling formations.The channel 32 is slightly larger than the channel 31, to allow for the thickness of the material. Similarly, the channels 13 and 25 comprise complimentary third and fourth coupling formations, and the channel 13 is slightly larger than the channel 25. The dimensions of the panel 1 can be chosen to suit any particular design requirement. Typically, the panel could have varying widths dependent on architectural and design requirements.The width could be in the range 0.5 1 metres. It could be of any length that is feasible to transport. The main profile of the panel 1 is formed by brake folding or forming or roll forming from sheet metal, and then the, gussets 14 are formed by stamping, together with any other gussets or like reinforcements.If required, gussets can be provided between the web portion 20 and the outer panel portion 30. The panel can be formed from alumLnum, galvanized or aluEfl wiized steel or stainless seel or other metal Further, it can be given any desired coating in a variety of colours. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3, in a cladding formed from panels according to the present invention, the panels co operate to form a continuous interior surface vapour barrier and a continuous exterior surface or weatherseal To form the vapour barrier and weatherseal, a suitable sealant can be provided between both the inner panel portions 10 and the outer panel portions 30. As shown in Figure 1, there is a panels3 3. which is similar to the panel 1, and like parts of the second panel 3 are given the same reference numeral. The channels 31 and 25 of the panel 3 engage the corresponding channels 32 and 13 of the panel 1. To secure the panels in position, the inner panel portion 10 can be secured to a frame not shown by means of screws at desired locations. The individual panels can be secured to one another by screws securing the complimentary sections together. For this purpose, the channels 13, 25, 31 and 32 can be pre formed with appropriate openings. Then, screws can be screwed through the cInnels 25 and 31 of the panel 3 into the channels 13 and 32 of the panel 1, leaving the screw heads in the channels 25, 31.For insulation purposes, known insulation material, such as fibreglass or mineral fibre, can be provided in the spaces formed between adjacent panels, as indicated at 2 in figure 1. To form a complete surface of a structure, the supporting steel framework is first assembled. Then, generally it is necessary to separate the inner panel portion 10 of one panel from the remainder of that panel. Conveniently, the inner panel portion 10 and the web portion 20 are separated together from the corresponding outer panel portion. This inner panel portion 10 can then be secured along one edge of the surface, with the web portion 20 along the edge itself. The inner panel portion 10 is screwed or otherwise secured to the frame at appropriateointervals. Insulation material 2 is laid against the inner panel portion 10 and secured in position. One can then place a complete panel 1 in position. It is placed in position with its outer panel portion 30 overlying the already positioned inner panel portion 10, so as to enclose the insulation material 2. Its inner panel portion 10 is secured to the frame by screws, and screws can be used to secure its channel 25 to the channel 13 of the previously laid separate inner panel portion 10. Since there is no previously laid exterior panel portion 30, its exterior panel portion 30 is secured by a special corner piece. The special corner piece is provided for providing continuity between the surface under construction and an adjacent surface. The channel 31 of this first complete panel can be screwed to this corner piece. After laying of this first complete panel another strip of insulation material is positioned and secured against its inner panel portion 10. Then, another complete panel can be laid. For this second and subsequent complete panels both the channels 25 and 31 can be secured by screwsto the corresponding channels 13 and 32 of the previously laid panel.This sequence can be repeated across the width of the surface, until a final complete panel is laid. The last complete panel will have its inner panel portion 10 adjacent an opposite edge of the surface. Again, insulation will be laid and secured against this inner portion 10. However, it will then be necessary to separate an outer panel portion 30 with its associated web portion 20 from the inner panel portion 10 of the panel. This separate outer panel portion 30 and web portion 20 unit can then be secured in position covering the final layer of insulation. It can be secured by means of screws and its channels 31 and 25. Again, a special corner piece or an end piece can be used to finish the surface. The preceding paragraph has described the assembly procedure for a surfaceWhosehhight corresponds to the length of the panels. In cases, where it is necessary to use two or more rows of panels to cover the entire surface, it is preferable that the rows of panels are laid simultaneously. Thus, for a two row surface, one would first position two separate inner panel portions 10 on the frame. Then, after laying appropriate insulation, two complete panels would be laid and secured, overlapping one another with their outer panel portions 30 covering the previously laid insulation. This procedure could then be continued across the full width of the surface Whilst the above described assembly technique requires the provision of separate inner and outer panel portions, this need not always be necessary.In particular, for the sides of a building special corner pieces could be provided that provide an inner panel portion on one side of the building and an outer panel portion on another side of the building. As described above, the web portion 20 is provided with cross pieces 23, separating apertures 24 from one another. The purpose of this construction is to increase the thermal resistance of the panel construction, in order to reduce heat transfer between the interior and the exterior of the building. For this purpose, various alternative designs of the web portion 20 could be used, and Figure 2 shows one alternative. Here, the web portion 20 is corrugated as indicated at 28. These corrugations 28 serve to increase the thermal path between the interior and the exterior, and hence to increase the thermal resistance. The corrugations 28 could be combined with apertures as shown in Figure 1, to further increase the thermal resistance.Further, instead of using cross pieces .23 which extend perpendicularly across the web section 20, diagonal cross pieces could be provided, which define triangular apertures. Reference will now be made to Figure 4, which shows a further embodiment of the present invention denoted by the reference 40. It includes a web portion and an exterior panel portion generally corresponding to those of the first embodiment. The web portion 20 and exterior panel portion 30 and corresponding parts thereof are given the same reference numerals as in Figure 1, for simplicity. The exterior panel portion 30 is the same as that described above. However, the web portion 20 is slightly different. It includes crosspieces 23 and apertures 24.Since the inner panel portion is omitted, channel 25 is omitted so the web portion 20 is entirely planar. Additionally, a narrow channel portion 40 is provided. It defines a flat bottomed U shape channel, for mounting the panel 40 to a support framework or the like not shown Assembling a wall using this type of panel is similar to that outlined above. However, insulation can be positioned, either before or after mounting the panels 40 in position . Before positioning the first panel, a support is provided for its free end, ie. by cutting of and securing the web portion 20, including the channel 32 in position. Then, the first panel 40 is laid. Its channel 31 is secured, by screws, to the channel 32 just mentioned. AIso,screws or the like secure the mounting portion 42 to the support framework This is then repeated across the width of the wall or roof, as before. If insulation has not already been installed, it an now be inserted from behind. Then, to the inside of the framework suitable drywalling panelling or the like can be secured, to complete the interior. Whilst channel shaped coupling formations 13, 25, 31 and 32 of trapezoidal cross section are shown, other coupling formations could have a V section. Alternatively, one coupling formation can comprise an edge bent at right angles to an adjacent part of the panel, and a second, complimentary coupling formation can comprise an inverted U section adapted to engage that edge. It is also to be appreciated that the embodiments of Figures 1 and 4 can be used together.
