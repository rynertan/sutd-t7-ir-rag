# MANUFACTURE OF BLANKS FOR RECORDING DISCS UTILIZING COEXTRUSION AND BLANKS AND RECORDS MADE THEREBY

## Abstract
It has been found that a layered recording disc having an inexpensive core layer and high quality recording groove accepting outer layers can be made in a relatively simple manner through an application of the technique known as coextrusion, wherein a common die, e.g. a coextrusion die 10 having a die orifice 11 for a plurality of streams 13,23 and 33 provides a multilayer coextrudate 60 having a plur ality of layers 64,74 and 84 . The coextrudate 60 can be cut into segments 60a with a suitable cutting means 20 . The coextrudate segments can be substantially of record thick ness with a circular periphery. Alternatively, coextrudate segments 60b can be much thicker than a record and much smaller in surface area. In either case, segments can be com pression molded into discs 100 having the desired profile and or grooves.
