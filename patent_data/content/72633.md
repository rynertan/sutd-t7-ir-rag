A grain dryer of the concurrent flow type wherein drying air is introduced into the top of a column above a grain bed in the column and grain is evenly distributed on to the top of the bed by a rotatable distributor which acts automatically to control the feed of grain in accordance with grain discharge. In accordance with a further feature the distributor is designed to avoid ploughing into a grain bed and so acts to maintain a flat top surface for the grain bed.
