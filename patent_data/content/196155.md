# METHOD OF FORMING AN OXIDE FILM ON A SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
A method of producing thin, e.g. 0.8 to 20 nm, oxide films on a silicon substrate includes pulse heating the substrate in an oxidising atmosphere to a peak temperature exceeding 500 C and typically in the range 700 to 1200 C. The oxide film can be used e.g. as a gate dielectric in MOS technology.
