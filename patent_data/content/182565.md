# Anchoring bolt.

## Abstract
A tie rod 3 is screw threadedly engaged within a threaded member 7 carrying a cone 8 which, together with a further cone 10, acts to expand a slitted expandable sleeve 9 when the rod 3 is rotated by a tool applied to a square cross section tip 21 so that the threaded member 7 is driven towards a fixed head 6 on the rod 3. The threaded member 7 carries a securing member 16 having projecting ribs which hold the threaded member 7 against rotation within a bore hole 20B as the rod 3 is rotated. The other end of the rod 3 is secured within a bore 20A of a dou ble skin cavity wall by rotating a nut 11 to cause a slitted ex pandable sleeve 13 to expand into the wall of the bore 20A due to action of conical members 12 and 14.

## Description
Improvements relating to anchoring bolts This invention is concerned with bolts which enable the end of a rod to be anchored at a position deep within a bore, When an anchoring bolt is to be located to some depth within a bore it may be impossible to insert a tool to act on the bolt itself in order to secure it in position and the only means of tightening the anchoring bolt is then by rotation of the rod itself. Means do however have to be provided to ensure that the anchoring bolt does not slip within the bore whilst the tightening operation is being carried out. According to the present invention there is provided an anchoring bolt assembly comprising an expandable sleeve positioned between a stop member and a threaded member screwed onto a threaded rod, and a securing member carried by the threaded member and having resilient projecting portions extending beyond the circumferential periphery of the sleeve in the unexpanded condition of the sleeve, the projecting portions on the securing member being designed to act to locate the threaded member against rotation, within a bore just large enough to receive the unexpanded sleeve, whilst the rod is rotated to cause the threaded member to move in a direction causing expansion of the sleeve. The provision of the securing member enables the relevant parts of the anchoring bolt to be held against rotation while the tightening operation is carried out by rotation of the threaded rod. In the preferred arrangement the securing member comprises a relatively thin metal tube having longitudinal slits, the tube being compressed so that portions of metal between the slits project outwardly as spring like portions. These portions will grip within the bore, and yet can be compressed as the anchoring bolt is pushed into the desired position within the bore. As an alternative the securing member could comprise a resilient projecting body of natural or synthetic rubber which could, if desired, have projecting metal tangs embedded into it which would bite into the sides of the bore.. Another possibility is to form the securing member from a partially compressible plastics material which might perhaps have a roughened or ribbed external surface. In a preferred arrangement the securing member will be situated about the threaded member and will be either frictionally or positively attached thereto. The expandable sleeve is ideally a tube incorporatinq longitudinally extending slits such that the material between the slits will be forced outwardly by conical members on the rod as the threaded member is tightened towards the stop member. In one arrangement the slits will extend alternately from opposite ends of the tube and may be enlarged at least in the central area of the tube. Other possibilities for the expandable sleeve include tubes having longitudinally extending slits opening at one end only of the tube and a coil spring which will be forced outwardly as it is compressed between its ends. In one arrangement the stop member will comprise a fixed head or lock nut secured near the outer end of the rod so that the sleeve and threaded member will be disposed inwardly of the outer end of the rod.In a preferred arrangement, for an anchoring bolt assembly disposed at the outer end of the rod, the threaded member carrying the securing member will be screwed onto the outer end of the rod and the sleeve will be disposed inwardly of the free end but outwardly of the stop member which may comprise a nut or lock nut screwed to a limit position on the threaded part of the rod or an enlarged flange formed as part of the rod itself. It is envisaged that a particular use for the anchoring bolt assembly will be in association with a tie rod for tying together the two parts of a cavity wall. In this case another anchoring bolt assembly will be constituted near the other end of the rod.The additional anchoring bolt assembly could comprise an expandable sleeve positioned between a stop member and a tightening nut which may be rotated directly by a tool as it will be close to the free end of the rod and thus to the exterior of the bore drilled through the two portions of the cavity wall. The invention may be performed in various ways and preferred embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates the separate parts of a cavity wall tie rod carrying anchoring bolts of this invention Figure 2 is a side view on an enlarged scale of an expandable sleeve and a securing member forming part of the anchoring bolt shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a side view of an alternative form of anchoring bolt assembly of this invention at the end of a tie rod. Figure 1 illustrates brick wall portions 1 and 2 of a cavity wall which are to be tied together by means of a tie rod 3. The two ends of the tie rod 3 carry threaded portions 4 and 5. At the end of the portion 4 a head 6 is positively secured, such as by gluing, so as to secure in place, in sequence, a threaded member 7, a conical member 8, a sleeve 9 and a further conical member 10. The other threaded portion 5 similarly carries a sequence of a nut 11, conical member 12, sleeve 13 and conical member t4 abutted against a further nut 15 which has been screwed on up to the end of the threaded portion 5. The threaded member 7 has a securing member 16 mounted about a waisted portion 17 of the member 7.As can be seen fom Figures 1 and 2 this securing member 16 is in the form of a metal tube having longitudinally extending slits 18 in the central area. The tube has then been compressed into a permanently stressed state so that ribs 19 project outwardly, much in the form of a child s paper lantern.The securing member 16 is either secured to the member 7 or grips it tightly so that the member 7 cannot rotate if the securing member 16 is held against rotation. In use a bore 20A, 20B is drilled through the two sections 1 and 2 of the wall, the bore portion 20B being blind ended. The tie rod 3 is then inserted into the bore until the head 6 reaches the blind end of the bore portion 20B. During this operation the resiliently flexible ribs 19 of the securing member 16 will compress inwardly to enable the anchoring bolt to be pushed home. The tie rod 3 has a projecting tip 21 which is of square cross section and this is gripped by a spanner so that the rod 3 can be rotated. During this rotation the securing member 16 will bite into the inner walls of the bore 20B and thus prevent rotation of the member 7 within the bore. Hence the member 7 will be caused to travel axially along the threaded portion 4 of the rod 3 so that the conical members 8 and 10 act on the ends of the sleeve 9. As can be seenfrom Figure 2 this sleeve 9 has alternating slits 22 extending to the two ends of the sleeve. As the conical portions 8 and 10 move towards one another they therefore force out free end portions of the sleeve 9 which will then bite into the internal wall of the bore 20B to fix the anchoring bolt in place in the wall section 1. It will be noted that the slits 22 have enlarged portions 23 in the central region of the sleeve 9 which help to allow the free end parts to splay outwardly. Once the one anchoring bolt is securely fixed within the wall portion 1 the other anchoring bolt incorporating the sleeve 13 is anchored into the wall section 2 by rotating the nut 11 by means of a spanner so that the conical portions 12 and 14 move towards one another to cause free end portions of the sleeve 13 to splay outwardly into gripping contact with the internal walls of the bore 20A in a manner similar to that for the sleeve 9. A rubber grommet 24 is positioned on the central portion of the tie rod 13 to act as a barrier for moisture which might tend two travel from one end to the other of the tie bar located in an external wall. A modified and preferred form of anchoring bolt assembly is illustrated in Figure 3. For simplicity the assembly situated at the outer end of the tie rod 3 only is illustrated but it willbe appreciated that an assembly similar to that comprising the parts 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 as shown in Figure 1 of the drawings will be mounted on the screw threaded portion 5 at the other end of the tie rod 3. In the arrangement shown in Figure 3 the threaded member 7A is screwed onto the tip of the tie rod 3 and incorporates a conical member 8A which will act together with a further conical member 10A to squeeze an expandable sleeve 9A into the expanded condition as the tie rod 3 is rotated. A nut 24 acts as a stop member for the conical member 10A. The threaded member 7A carries the securing member 16A about a waisted portion 17A.The securing member 16A is formed to provide outwardly projecting ribs 19A although one rib 25 projects inwardly to be received in a longitudinal slot 26 cut into the surface of the waisted portion 17A to hold the securing member 16A against rotation relative to the threaded member 7A. In use the tie rod 3 is inserted through bore holes drilled through two sections of a wall so that the anchoring bolt assembly is received within the inner bore, the ribs 19A on the securing member 16A gripping the internal wall surface of the bore. The tie rod 3 is then rotated by means of a suitable tool at the end remote from the end carrying the anchoring bolt assembly shown in Figure 3 with the result that the threaded member 7A rides down the threaded portion 4 to cause expansion of the sleeve 9A resulting ultimately in a secure engagement of the anchoring bolt assembly within the bore. As shown in Figure 3 the sleeve 9A incorporates slits 27 extending from either end, the enlarged portions of the slits at the inner ends allowing the intermediate parts 28 to flex readily in the outward direction. A continuous slit 29 is formed at one position inthe sleeve 9A. The other end of the tie rod 3 may be secured within the further bore in the other section of the wall in a manner similar to that described with reference to Figure 1. The sleeve 13 in this case may be of the form as illustrated at 9A in Figure 3. The provision of the threaded member 7A at the extreme end of the tie rod 3 removes the need for a fixed head secured at the tip of the rod. If desired the stop member comprising the nut 24 could be replaced by a shoulder on the tie rod 3 achieved either by forming the rod with a central section of enlarged diameter or by welding or otherwise securing a washer or sleeve onto the tie rod inwardly of the threaded portion 4.
