## Description
The present invention generally relates to video signal digital processing systems, and more particularly to a video signal digital processing system in which a video signal is sampled at a sampling frequency which is in a predetermined relationship with a horizontal synchronizing signal frequency of the video signal so that the video signal can be processed digitally by use of a simple circuit. The same circuit can be used to digitally process the video signal regardless of whether the video signal employs the NTSC system or the PAL system. A video signal processing circuit is used in a television receiver, a video tape recorder, and the like. A conventional processing circuit processes a video signal in the analog form, and for this reason, a large lumber of circuit elements such as capacitors, resistors, and coils are used and the circuit elements require adjustments. Accordingly, the conventional processing circuit is relatively expensive, and the productivity of the processing circuit is poor because the circuit elements require adjustments. Hence, there were demands to reduce the number of circuit elements of the processing circuit and to make it unnecessary to adjust the circuit elements. As a method of meeting such demands, there is the method of processing the video signal digitally. However, the existing television broadcasting systems can be roughly divided into the NTSC system, the PAL system, and the SECAM system. Hence, it is necessary to independently prepare a digital processing circuit for digitally processing the video signal for each of the three television systems. However, the NTSC system and the PAL system are similar to some extent, and with respect to the luminance signal, there are no substantial differences between the two systems except for the frequency band of the luminance signal. Therefore, if the chrominance signal of the NTSC system video signal and the chrominance signal of the PAL system video signal can be processed in the same chrominance signal processing circuit, it becomes possible to process the NTSC video signal and the PAL system video signal in the same digital processing circuit, and the effects obtained would be great. In other words, it becomes unnecessary to independently design the digital processing circuit for the NTSC system and the PAL system, and the manufacturing cost of the digital processing circuit can be kept down to a minimum since the same digital processing circuit can be used in common for processing the NTSC system video signal and the PAL system video signal. S.M.P.T.E. Journal, vol. 90, No.10, October, 1981, pp 956 959, Scarsdale, New York, U.S.A. discloses a video signal digital processing system having a first frequency converter, a second frequency converter, an analog to digital convertor, and a digital to analog converter. The first frequency converter generates a signal sampled at a frequency f Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other appended claims. It is thus possible to provide a video signal digital processing system in which a video signal is sampled at a sampling frequency 3Mf It is also possible to provide a video signal digital processing system in which the video signal is sampled at a sampling frequency 3M 1 f It is further possible to provide a video signals digital processing system in which the video signal is sampled at a sampling frequency 3M 1 f It is also possible to provide a video signal digital processing system in which the video signal is sampled at a sampling frequency Nf The present invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Generally, when sampling an analog signal, the sampling frequency is selected over twice the maximum frequency included in the analog signal in accordance with the sampling theorem. Hence, as a first condition, a video signal must be sampled at a sampling frequency f On the other hand, when processing the chrominance signal of the video signal, a comb filter is generally used to eliminate the crosstalk noise components. However, since the comb filter eliminates the crosstalk components by using the correlation of the video signal between two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines, corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines must be aligned with each other along the vertical direction of the picture. In other words, as a second condition, the sampling frequency f The horizontal synchronizing signal frequency f When sampling the NTSC video signal and the PAL system video signal at one of the sampling frequencies f The comb filter for eliminating the crosstalk components uses a delay circuit having a delay time of 1H in the case of the NTSC video signal and 2H in the case of the PAL system video signal, where For example, when an 8 bit digital video signal obtained by sampling the PAL system video signal at a sampling frequency of 18 MHz is passed through the delay circuit having the delay time of 2H, the memory constituting the delay circuit must have a memory capacity of 18,432 2x1152x8 bits. However, when a decimation process is performed to extract the sampled data of the digital video signal with an interval of two samples so as to essentially reduce the sampling frequency to 6 MHz which is 1 3 the original sampling frequency of 18 MHz, the required memory capacity of the memory can be reduced to 6,144 bits which is 1 3 the originally required memory capacity. As a result, the required memory capacity can be reduced by 12,288 bits. An additional circuit, that is, a decimation circuit must be provided to perform the decimation process. However, the desirable effects obtained by the provision of the decimation circuit are much greater compared to the disadvantages which are introduced by the provision of the decimation circuit. In other words, when the decimation circuit is used and the memory capacity is reduced, it becomes possible to downsize the circuit, reduce the cost of the circuit, reduce the power consumption of the circuit, and improve the reliability of the circuit. Next, description will be given with respect to a case where the decimation process is performed with respect to the video signal having the chrominance subcarrier frequency thereof converted into the frequency f Accordingly, it is desirable to perform a 1 3 decimation process wherein the sampled data are extracted with an interval of two samples. FIG.1B shows the frequency spectrum of the chrominance subcarrier when this 1 3 decimation process is performed. The folded back alias component of the signal folds back about the frequency f Accordingly, it may be seen from the table described before that the sampling frequency f Next, description will be given with respect to a first embodiment of the video signal digital processing system according to the present invention by referring to FIG.2. In the present embodiment, the video signal digital processing system is applied to a magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus video tape recorder, or simply VTR which processes the video signal digitally and records and or reproduces the video signal on and or from a magnetic tape. The block system of the present embodiment and block systems of second through fifth embodiments which will be described later on in the specification are the same, and for this reason, reference will be made to the block system shown in FIG.2 when describing the second through fifth embodiments. A composite video signal is applied to an input terminal 11 and is supplied to an analog to digital A D converter 12. The A D converter 12 is supplied with an output clock signal of an oscillator 25 having a frequency f A decimation circuit 15 is supplied with the output clock signal of the oscillator 25 and an output clock signal of a 1 3 frequency divider 26 having a frequency f The comb filter 18 has a known construction, and for example, the comb filter 18 comprises a delay circuit for delaying an input signal by a delay time of 1N or 2H , an adder, and a switching circuit provided between the delay circuit and the adder and for supplying an output of the delay circuit to the adder only in the reproducing mode. The adder adds the output of the delay circuit and the input signal. In this case, the delay circuit comprises a number of stages equal to the number of samples remaining in one horizontal scanning line after the chrominance subcarrier is subjected to the decimation process. Accordingly, in the case where f The interpolation circuit 19 performs an interpolation process responsive to the two kinds of clock signals so as to restore the data which have been subjected to the decimation process back into the original data, and supplies an output signal to a bandpass filter 20 which is responsive to the clock signal having the frequency f Oscillators 28 and 29 supply frequency conversion data to the respective frequency converters 13 and 21. A mode discriminating signal indicating that the VTR is in a recording or reproducing mode is applied to a terminal 30, and a system discriminating signal indicating that the composite video signal employs the PAL system or the NTSC system is applied to a terminal 31. A control circuit 27 controls the output frequency conversion data of the oscillators 28 and 29 based on the mode discriminating signal and the system discriminating signal. An embodiment of the frequency converter 13 is shown in FIG.3A. The output signal of the A D converter 12 is applied to an input terminal 35 and is supplied to multipliers 36 and 37. For example, a cosine wave data from the oscillator 28 is supplied to the multiplier 36 through a terminal 38, and a sine wave data from the oscillator 28 is supplied to the multiplier 37 through a terminal 39. An output signal of the multiplier 36 is passed through a delay circuit 40 and is supplied to an adder 42, and an output signal of the multiplier 37 is passed through a 90 phase shifter 41 and is supplied to the adder 42. A Hilbert filter may be used for the 90 phase shifter 41. An output signal of the adder 42 is obtained through an output terminal 43 and is supplied to the bandpass filter 14. The output clock signal of the oscillator 25 having the frequency f On the other hand, the frequency converter 21 performs an operation complementary to the operation of the frequency converter 13, and description on the operation of the frequency converter 21 will be omitted. For example, the frequency converter 21 is constructed as shown in FIG.3B. In FIG.3B, the frequency converter 21 comprises a delay circuit 47, a 90 phase shifter 48, multipliers 49 and 50, and an adder 51. The output signal of the bandpass filter 20 is applied to an input terminal 46, and an output signal of the adder 51 is obtained through an output terminal 55 and is supplied to the D A converter 22. The output clock signal of the oscillator 25 having the frequency f Next, description will be given with respect to an embodiment of the decimation circuit 15 by referring to FIG.4 and FIGS.5 A through 5 D . The decimation circuit 15 comprises latch circuits 57 and 58. The output signal of the bandpass filter 14 is applied to an input terminal group 59. The output clock signal of the oscillator 25 having the frequency f The interpolation circuit 19 has a construction similar to that of the decimation circuit 15 shown in FIG.4. In the case where the circuit shown in FIG.4 is the interpolation circuit 19, the output signal of the comb filter 18 is applied to the input terminal group 59 and the signal obtained through the output terminal group 62 is supplied to the bandpass filter 20. In addition, the clock signal having the frequency f As described before, the phase of the chrominance signal is shifted by 90 for every 1H by the phase shift process performed in the recording mode of the VTR. The demodulating process of the phase shift process is performed in the reproducing mode and the crosstalk components are eliminated by use of the comb filter 18. However, there are cases where the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines become deviated from each other along the time base because of the decimation process performed in the decimation circuit 15. In other words, the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines become aligned with each other along the vertical direction of the picture only when the sampling frequency f Description will now be given with respect to the sampled points and the phase of the chrominance subcarrier after the decimation process is performed. FIG.6 A through 6 C show waveforms of the chrominance subcarrier after the demodulating process of the phase shift process is performed in the case where f When the phase of 1.5 MHz the chrominance subcarrier indicated by the phantom line II Strictly speaking, the corresponding sampled points in the j th and j 1 Description is given heretofore with respect to the case where the sampling frequency f Accordingly, in the second embodiment of the invention, the comb filter 18 shown in FIG.2 is constructed as shown in FIG.7. The output signal of the filter circuit 17 is applied to an input terminal 65. The signal from the input terminal 65 is supplied directly to an adder 68 on one hand, and is supplied to the adder 68 through a 90 phase shifter 66, a delay circuit 67, and a switch SW on the other. The switch SW is open in the recording mode of the VTR and is closed in the reproducing mode. The phase shifter 66 performs a phase shift of 90 when f In the present embodiment, in the case where f Next, description will be given with respect to the third embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the phase of the decimation process is shifted within the time period of the horizontal synchronising signal at a rate of once per horizontal scanning line when the sampling frequency f FIG.11 shows an embodiment of the decimation circuit 15 which constitutes an essential part of the present embodiment. The clock signal shown in FIG.12 A having the frequency f In the present embodiment, the sampling frequency f The interpolation circuit 19 has a construction shown in FIG.13 and performs an operation complementary to that of the decimation circuit 15. In FIG.13, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG.11 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. The output signal of the comb filter 18 is supplied to a latch circuit 79 through an input terminal group 78. The latch circuit 79 latches the output signal of the comb filter 18 responsive to one of the first, second, and third clock signals shown in FIGS.14 B through 14 D which has the frequency f Next, description will be given with respect to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the sampling frequency f FIGS.15 A through 15 C show the chrominance subcarrier in the reproducing mode of the VTR when the sampling frequency f Strictly speaking, the corresponding sampled points in the j th and j 1 th lines after the decimation process is performed are not aligned with each other along the vertical direction of the picture. However, the positional deviation of the corresponding sampled points in the j th and j 1 th lines is 63 nsec 1 1001 of 1H which is extremely small, and no problems are introduced when the phases at the corresponding samples points are the same. Accordingly, the crosstalk components can be eliminated in the reproducing mode even when the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines positionally deviate from each other, as long as the phases at the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines are the same. Incidentally, the positional deviation of the reverse phase is 63 nsec. In addition, since the chrominance signal IV Generally, since the chrominance subcarrier frequency is selected to f When r‚ÇÅ is not equal to zero, the phase of the chrominance subcarrier shifts by 1 4 x r‚ÇÅ x 360 for every line. In addition, the number When r‚ÇÅ r‚ÇÇ, the crosstalk components can be eliminated in the reproducing mode with ease by use of a comb filter. In addition, when r‚ÇÅ As a concrete numerical example, when f From the numerical examples given above, the frequency to which f In the present embodiment, the operations of the frequency converters 13 and 21 shown in FIG.2 are basically the same as those in the first embodiment described before. Accordingly, in the recording mode, the frequency converter 13 frequency converts the chrominance subcarrier frequency from 3.58 MHz to 3.9375 MHz, for example, and at the same time performs the phase shift process in which the phase of the chrominance signal is shifted by 90 for every horizontal scanning period. In the reproducing mode, the frequency converter 13 frequency converts the chrominance subcarrier frequency from 629 kHz to 3.9375 MHz and at the same time performs the demodulating process of the phase shift process. In this case, when f Next, description will be given with respect to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the sampling frequency f FIGS.17 A through 17 C show waveforms of the chrominance subcarrier in the reproducing mode when the sampling frequency f Strictly speaking, the corresponding sampled points in the j th and j 1 th lines after the decimation process is performed are not aligned with each other along the vertical direction of the picture . However, the positional deviation of the corresponding sampled points in the j th and j 1 th lines is 56 nsec 1 1144 of 1H which is extremely small, and no problems are introduced when the phases at the corresponding sampled points are the same. Accordingly, the crosstalk components can be eliminated in the reproducing mode without performing the demodulating process of the phase shift process even when the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines positionally deviate from each other, as long as the phases at the corresponding sampled points in the two mutually adjacent horizontal scanning lines are the same. The phase of the chrominance subcarrier is inverted depending on the field due to the phase shift process performed in the recording mode. For example, between a field Generally, the equations 1 and 2 should stand as in the case of the fourth embodiment described before. When the remainder r‚ÇÅ is not equal to zero, the phase of the chrominance subcarrier is shifted by 1 4 x r‚ÇÅ x 360 for every horizontal scanning line. By taking into consideration the phase shift process in which the phase of the chrominance signal is shifted by 90 for every horizontal scanning period in the recording mode, the final phase shift quantity becomes equal to zero or 180 when the remainder r‚ÇÅ is equal to one or three, and the final phase shift quantity becomes equal to 90 or 90 when the remainder r‚ÇÅ is equal to zero or two. The sampled points are shifted by r‚ÇÇ for every horizontal scanning line after the decimation process is performed. When a quantity which is obtained by adding a quantity corresponding to the phase shift performed in the recording mode to the remainder r‚ÇÅ, coincides with a quantity which is obtained by adding the quantity corresponding to the phase shift performed in the recording mode to the remainder r‚ÇÇ, the crosstalk components can be eliminated with ease in the reproducing mode by use of a comb filter. Even when the above two quantities do not coincide with each other, the crosstalk components can be eliminated by replacing the adder of the comb filter by a subtracting circuit as in the case of processing the field The frequency to which f In the present embodiment, the operation of the block system shown in FIG.2 in the recording mode is basically the same as that of the fourth embodiment described before. Hence, in the recording mode, the frequency converter 13 frequency converts the chrominance subcarrier frequency from 3.58 MHz to 4.5 MHz, for example, and at the same time performs the phase shift process in which the phase of the chrominance signal is shifted by 90 for every horizontal scanning period. In the reproducing mode, however, the frequency converter 13 simply frequency converts the chrominance subcarrier frequency from 629 kHz to 4.5 MHz. The demodulating process of the phase shift process is performed in the reproducing mode in the frequency converter 21 which frequency converts the chrominance subcarrier frequency from 4.5 MHz to 629 kHz. For example, when f In each of the embodiments described heretofore, descriptions are given with respect to the cases where the video signal digital processing system according to the present invention is applied to the VTR. However, the composite video signal which is to be processed digitally in the video signal digital processing system according to the present invention is not limited to the composite video signal which is to be recorded on the magnetic tape in the VTR nor the composite video signal which is reproduced from the magnetic tape in the VTR. For example, the present invention may also be applied to a digital processing circuit within a television receiver. In this case, it is not essential to perform the phase shift process and the demodulating process of the phase shift process described before. Moreover, the construction of the frequency converters 13 and 21 in the second through fourth embodiments is not shown in the drawings, however, this is because those skilled in the art can easily perform the necessary circuit modifications from the circuits described in conjunction with FIGS.3A and 3B.
