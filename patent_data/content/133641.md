## Description
FLAME RETARDANT THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTER COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The addition of flame retardant agents to normally flammable thermoplastic polymers to render the latter more flame resistant is well known in the plastics art. One such class of materials comprises flame retardant blends of polyphenylene ether resin and styrenic polymers, many types of which are described in the patent literature.William Haaf, in U.S. Patent No. 3,639,506, discloses the usefulness of aromatic phosphate compounds and aromatic halogen compounds together as a flame retardant agent for compositions of polyphenylene ether resin and styrene resin. Glenn Cooper and Arthur Katchman in U.S. PatentNo. 4,101,503 describe impact modified polyphenylene ether resin compositions, a preferred feature of which is the inclusion of a flame retardant agent which can be a halogenated organic compound in admixture with a phosphorus compound. Compositions of polyphenylene ether and styrenic polymers containing a flame retardant combination of an aromatic phosphate and an aromatic halogen compound are also disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,191,685 to Haaf .Robert Axelrod in U.S. Patent No. 4,154,775, discloses flame retardant compositions of polyphenylene ether resin, polystyrene and cyclic phosphates having excellent appearance and physical properties in molded forms. Another class of flame retardant polymeric materials comprises the polyester resins, and particularly polyialkylene terephthalate resins and blends of these resins modified with various fire retardant additives.Compositions of this kind are disclosed in the patent literature, including U.S. Patent Nos. 3,915,926 Wambach 4,124,561 Phipps, Jr., et al. 4,220,735 Dieck, et al. 4,257,937 Cohen, et al. and 4,344,878 Dolce . Among the fire retardant additives taught as suitable for the polyester resins are aromatic phosphate compounds see, for example, U.S. 4,344,878. It has been proposed by Abolins and Holub inU.S. Patent No. 4,013,613 that poly alkylene terephthalates can be admixed with polyphenylene ethers and the mixture can be made flame retardant if desired by the audition of a conventional agent or agents for that purpose. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises flame retardant blend compositions of a a polyester resin, and b a flame retardant system comprised of i a polyphenylene ether resin, ii an organic phosphate, and iii a stable brominated material. The polyphenylene ether resin component functions to confer better flame resistance in comparison with the corresponding composition without this component present. Other ingredients can optionally be included to enhance the properties. The compositions of this invention are useful for the same purposes generally as conventional polyester resins and blends of such resins. Thus, for example, they can be extruded, calendared, molded or shaped in other ways into various articles for industrial or household use. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyesters which are employed as component a in the present compositions are relatively high molecular weight essentially linear, normally flammable thermoplastic polymers. Preferably, they are polymeric glycol esters of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid.These polymers are available commercially or can be prepared by known techniques, such as by the alcoholysis of esters of the phthalic acid with a glycol and subsequent polymerization, by heating glycols with the free acids or with halide derivatives thereof, and similar processes.Such polymers and methods of their preparation are described further by Whinfield, et al., in U.S. Patent No.2,465,319 and by Pengilly in U.S. Patent No. 3,047,539, and elsewhere. Preferred polyesters are of the family consisting of high molecular weight, polymeric glycol terephthalates or isophthalates having repeating units of the formulaEMI3.1 where n is a whole number from two to ten, and more usually from two to four, and mixtures of such esters, including copolyesters of terephthalic and isophthalic acids of up to 30 mol percent isophthalic units. Especially preferred polyesters are poly ethylene terephthalate and poly l,4 butylene terephthalate . Special mention is made of the latter, which crystallizes at a good rate and may be used for injection molding without the need for nucleating agents or long molding cycles. Especially favored when high melt strength is important are branched high melt viscosity poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins which include small amounts, for example, up to 5 mol percent based on the terephthalate units, of a branching component containing at least three ester forming groups. The branching component can be one which provides branching in the acid unit portion of the polyester, or in the glycol unit portion, or it can be a hybrid.Illustrative of such branching components are tri or tetracarboxylic acids, such as trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid, and lower alkyl esters thereof, and the like, or preferably, polyols, and especially preferably, tetrols, such as pentaerythritol, triols, such as trimethylolpropane, or dihydroxy carboxylic acids and hydroxydicarboxylic acids and derivatives, such as dimethyl hydroxyterephthalate, and the like. The branched poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins and their preparation are described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,953,404 Borman . Illustratively, the high molecular weight polyesters useful in the practice of this invention have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.2 deciliters per gram, and more usually from about 0.4 to 1.5 deciliters per gram as measured in solution in ortho chlorophenol or a 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane mixture at 250 to 300C. Also useful are copolyesters, such as segmented copolyesters having a multiplicity of recurring etherester and or ester units as described by William Witsiepe in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,651,014 3,763,109 and 3,766,146.Useful materials are available from E.I. duPont de Nemours and Co. under the trade designation 11Hytrel resins, for example, Hytrel 4055 and Hytrel 5555. The flame retardant agent portion of the composition is composed of an effective amount of a flame retardant organic phosphate, an effective amount of a stable brominated material which serves as a co flame retardant for the organic phosphate, and an amount of polyphenylene ether resin. The polyphenylene ether resin, component b i of the flame retardant, is preferably a homo or copolymer having units of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein Q, Q , Q and Q , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals, hydrocarbonoxy radicals, and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals and n represents the total number of monomer units and is an integer at least about 20, and preferably at least 50. In general, the polyphenylene ether resins are self condensation products of monohydric monocyclic phenols produced by reacting the phenols with oxygen in the presence of complex metal catalysts, with molecular weight being controlled by reaction time, longer times providing a higher average number of repeating units. Particular procedures are known to those skilled in the art and are described in the patent literature, including U.S. PatentNos 3,306,874 and 3,306,875 to Allan Hay , and U.S. Patent Nos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358 to Gelu Stamatoff . Illustrative polymers which can be produced by such procedures and which are within the above general formula are poly 2, 6 dilauryl l,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 diphenyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dimethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2, diethoxy l,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methoxy 6 ethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethyl 6 stearyloxy l,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dichloro1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6 phenyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dibenzyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 chloro 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dibromo 1,4 phenylene ether and the like. Examples of other polyphenylene ethers corresponding to the above formula can be found in the above referenced patents of Hay and Stamatoff. Also included are polyphenylene ether copolymers, such as copolymers of 2,6 dimethylphenol with other phenols, for example, with 2,3,6 trimethylphenol or 2 methyl 6 butylphenol, etc. For purposes of the present invention, an especially preferred family of polyphenylene ethers include those having alkyl substitution in the two positions ortho to the oxygen ether atom, i.e., those of the above formula wherein Q and Q are alkyl, most preferably having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Illustrative members of this class are poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4phenylene ether poly 2 ,6 diethyl l ,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6 ethyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl6 propyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dipropyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethyl 6 propyl l , 4 phenylene ether and the like. The most preferred polyphenylene ether resin for purposes of the present invention is poly 2,6dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether. The polyphenylene ether resins useful in the compositions of this invention can be prepared by following known procedures, including those described by AllanHay in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875 and byGelu Stamatoff in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358. The organic phosphate, component b ii of the flame retardant agent, can be a compound having the formulaEMI6.1 where R is the same or different and is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl substituted aryl, halogen substituted aryl, aryl substituted alkyl, halogen, or a combination of any of the foregoing, provided at least one R is aryl. Examples include phenyl bisdodecyl phosphate, phenylbisneopentyl phosphate, phenyl bis ,S,5 trimethyl hexyl phosphate , ethyldiphenyl phosphate, 2 ethylhexyldi p tolyl phosphate, bis 2 ethylhexyl p tolylphosphate, tritolyl phosphate, bis 2 ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate, tri nonylphenyl phosphate, di dodecyl ptolyl phosphate, tri cresyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, dibutylphenyl phosphate, 2 chloroethyldiphenyl phosphate, p tolyl bis 2,5,5 trimethylhexyl phosphate, 2 ethylhexyldiphenyl phosphate, and the like. The preferred phosphates are those in which each R is aryl.Especially preferred is triphenyl phosphate, which may be either unsubstituted or substituted, for example, isopropylated triphenyl phosphate. Alternatively, the aromatic phosphate can be a di or polyfunctional compound or polymer having the formulaEMI7.1 EMI7.2 EMI8.1 and mixtures thereof, wherein R1, R3 and R5 are, independently, hydrocarbon R2, R4, R6 and R27 are, independently, 3 hydrocarbon or hydrocarbonoxy X , X and X are halogen m and r are 0 or integers from 1 to 4, and n and p are from 1 to 30. Examples include the bis diphenyl phosphates of resorcinol, hydroquinone or bisphenol A, respectively, or their polymeric higher molecular weight counterparts. These phosphates and methods of their preparation are described in British Patent No. 2,043,083. In preferred embodiments, the polyphenylene ether resin is present in amounts equivalent to or greater than the organic phosphate compound, and especially in a weight ratio of polyphenylene ether organic phosphate of between 1 1 and 20 1. In general, components b i and b ii are supplied in amounts sufficient to provide between about 5 and about 70 parts by weight of the former and between about 1 and about 20 parts by weight of the latter, based on 100 parts of resin in the composition, i.e., the polyester and polyphenylene ether resins combined. Small amounts of a stable brominated material can further enhance the flame retardancy of the present compositions. This material should be reasonably stable at elevated temperatures above 1000C., and relatively non volatile, e.g., having a low volatility at temperatures of 100 to 1500C. The stable brominated material can be a compound of the formulaEMI9.1 where R is alkylene, straight or branched, having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and more preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and q and s represent the total number of bromine atoms on each ring and are independently integers from 1 to 5. Amounts of between about 1 and about 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts of total resins, are normally sufficient to decrease the average quenching time and or to retard the tendency of the composition to drip molten resin, and such amounts are preferred. Examples of bis phenoxy compounds useful in the practice of this invention are l,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromo phenoxy ethane 1, 3 bis 2,4, 6 tribromophenoxy propane 1,4 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy butane and 2,2 bis 4 bromophenoxy propane. Preferred are 1,2 bis 2,4,6tribromophenoxy ethane and 1,2 bis 2,3,4,5,6 pentabromo phenoxy ethane. The above compounds are available commercially or can be made by following known procedures, such as those which are described by Arnold Anderson in U.S.Patent No. 4,016,138. By way of illustration, the bisphenoxy compound may be prepared by reacting a halogenated phenolic with a halogenated alkane in the presence of a base at a temperature of from 40 to 2000C. Suitable bases include alkali metal hydroxides, e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide, carbonates, bicarbonates, oxides and hydrides. The reaction can be conducted in an organic solvent, such as a ketone or alcohol, or in an aqueous solvent, such as water or a mixture of water and alcohol or water and a ketone. The bis phenoxy compound is recovered by conventional methods such as distillationor crystallization and can be purified by standard techniques. Also useful as component b iii are flame retardant brominated polymers, including those which are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,334,154 Kim and U.S. Patent No. 3,833,685 Wambach . Preferably, these are aromatic carbonate copolymers having units of the formulaEMI10.1 in which R1 and R2 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl, X1 and 2 are bromo or chloro, and m and r are from 1 to 4, and units of the formula EMI10.2 in which R1 and R are as defined above. Especially preferred are oligomeric tetrabromobisphenol A polycarbonates chain stopped with tribromophenol. The present compositions can also be formulated to include one or more additives of the kind which are conventional forEthermoplastic polyester resins and blends to facilitate processing or to improve the chemical and physical properties of the processed articles. The additives can be selected from among, for instance, mold release agents, plasticizers, anti oxidants, stabilizers, mineral fillers e.g., clay , pigments, dyes and so forth.These are normally added in minor but effective amounts ranging from about 1 up to about 50 by weight, or more, of the total composition. For other property modification, it may be helpful to add a modifying polymer selected from among polymers having elastomeric properties. These may be co or terpolymers of an elastomeric material, such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene or other rubbery polyolefin.Examples include polystyrene polybutadiene block copolymers, polystyrene polyisoprene block copolymers, polystyrene polybutadiene polystyrene block copolymers, polystyrene polyethylene polybutylene polystyrene block copolymers, and so forth. Preparation of the compositions may be accomplished by milling the ingredients at a temperature in the range between 440 to 460OF. 227 to 238eC. , and molding the milled material at a temperature of 440 to 5500F. 227 to 2600C . Other methods of preparation are possible, however, as shown in some of the examples.

Other modifications and variations of the invention are possible in the light of the above disclosure. For instance, instead of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate or poly ethylene terephthalate individually, mixtures of these two can be employed. Copolyesters can also be substituted for the homopolymeric polyesters shown. Instead of triphenyl phosphate, other organic phosphate flame retardant compounds are possible. In place of 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy ethane, one may use 1,2 bisX2,3,4,5,6 pentabromo phenoxy ethane. Optionally, the compositions can and often do also contain an additional compound selected from among those known to synergistically enhance the flame retardancy effect of brominated compounds, such as synergistic agents based on antimony or molybdenum. Particular mention is made of antimony oxide, as shown above. Small amounts of less than 10 by weight, for example, are usually sufficient to improve the performance of the brominated compound and upgrade the flame retardancy overall. It is to be understood, therefore, that changes can be made in the particular embodiments shown which are still within the full intended scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.
