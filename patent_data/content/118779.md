# Voltage regulator for charging generator.

## Abstract
A voltage regulator for a charging generator is disclosed which comprises an a.c. generator having armature wind ings 1 and a field winding 2 , and a battery 9 which receives the rectified output of the a.c. generator and is charged by the same. The voltage regulator 6 regulates the output voltage of the a.c. generator by controlling the current flowing through the field winding 2 . To prevent the output voltage of the a.c. generator from becoming a high voltage when a connecting wire connecting the rectified output of the a.c. generator to the battery is broken, the regulator includes also abnormality detection means 30, 50 which compares the rectified output V
