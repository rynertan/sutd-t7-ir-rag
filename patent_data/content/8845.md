# Curable and cured polysulfide polymer compositions, article manufactured therefrom and processes for preparing the cured compositions and manufactured article.

## Abstract
Inclusion of an effective amount of substantially anhydr ous acetic acid in a zinc oxide cured liquid poysulfide polymer based composition results in a cured composition which is suitable for extrusion under heat and pressure and which on cooling reverts to a rubbery solid with essentially unchanged physical properties. The compositions are useful for the man ufacutre of sealants and extrudible goods such as hoses.
