# Apparatus for the oral administration of capsules to animals.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the oral administration of capsules to ani mals, particularly ruminants such as sheep, comprises a tu bular member 22 adapted to be inserted into the animal s mouth so that the tip of the tubular member is near the root of the animal s tongue, means for introducing a capsule 20 into the tubular member and for propelling the capsule to its tip, in which the tip of the tubular member 22 consists of two tip portions 110 extending from the mouth of the tubular mem ber and laterally spaced from one another so as to define a cavity in which a capsule 20 is deposited at the root of the ani mal s tongue. The top of the tubular member has a convexly curved upper surface adapted to engage the animal s soft pa late to encourage a swallowing reaction, and a lower surface shaped to engage and restrain movement of the dorsum and the front part of the animal s tongue. Apparatus is disclosed in which the means for propelling the capsule along the tubular member comprises means for supplying air or gas under pres sure to the tubular member. The use of a gas to propel the cap sule ensures that it is administred rapidly with no risk of damage to the animal.
