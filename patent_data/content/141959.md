## Description
VEHICLE COMPRISING A BODY AND DASH PANEL OF IMPROVEDTYPE This invention relates to a vehicle comprising a body and dash panel of improved type. In the description given hereinafter, the term dash panel signifies that assembly of elements disposed in the front zone of a vehicle passenger compartment and which supports essentially the vehicle instrument panel, the steering column carrying the steering wheel, and the pedal board carrying the control pedals clutch, brake and accelerator . In known vehicles, the dash panel is usually constituted by an upper portion of the fire protection bulkhead which separates the vehicle passenger compartment from its engine compartment. This bulkhead forms an integral part of the vehicle body, and comprises support brackets for the instrument panel and for the vehicle controls. Vehicles of the described type are not free from drawbacks, and in particular the form of the dash panel compels the personnel responsible for the assembly of the instrument panel and vehicle controls to assume uncomfortable and poorly productive working positions, so slowing down assembly. Moreover, when the vehicle driving position is to be changed by passing for example from a vehicle with left hand drive to a vehicle with right hand drive or vice versa, conventional dash panels have the drawback of requiring extensive modification work particularly to the body load bearing structures. Finally, it is not possible to insert vehicle accessory devices such as an air conditioning unit and or a servo brake between the instrument panel and fire protection bulkhead of the described vehicles.These devices must therefore be mounted inside the vehicle engine compartment and thus become disposed in positions which are poorly accessible for any repair work, and are exposed to damaging thermal and mechanical stresses. The object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle free from the described drawbacks, and in particular provided with a dash panel of easy and rapid assembly, and on which the vehicle control devices can be pre mounted. A further object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle having a body such as to enable auxiliary devices to be mounted between the fire protection bulkhead and the vehicle instrument panel inside the vehicle passenger compartment itself, with out modifying the body structure. Said objects are attained according to the present invention by a vehicle of the type comprising a body defining a passenger compartment and an engine compartment separated by means of a transverse fire protection bulkhead, and a dash panel for said passenger compartment provided at least with a steering column and a pedal board, characterised in that said fire protection bulkhead comprises a substantially flat lower element arranged to frontwardly bound the ,r of said passenger compartment, and a cup shaped upper element having its concavity facing said passenger compartment and its convexity projecting into the interior of said engine compartment, at least part of said upper element jutting towards this latter beyond said lower element said dash panel being constituted by a support cross member arranged to be fixed rigidly, but removably, to said body inside said passenger compartment in a position facing said bulkhead and defining in said passenger compartment, together with said upper bulkhead element, a housing compartment for accessory devices of said vehicle, said cross member being arranged to support said accessory devices inside said compartment, and supporting said steering column and said pedal board, which are mounted directly on said cross member and become fixed by means of this latter to said body. The present invention will be more apparent from the description of one embodiment given hereinafter by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through the front portion of a vehicle constructed in accordance with the present invention Figures 2 and 3 are respectively a plan and frontal view of the dash panel of the vehicle of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a section through the dash panel of Figure 3 on the line IV IV and Figure 5 is an exploded view of the dash panel of Figures 2, 3 and 4. In Figure 1, the reference numeral 1 indicates overall a vehicle of any known type, and in particular a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a body 2 constructed of welded sheet metal elements and defining internally a passenger compartment 3 and an engine compartment 4 which is separated from the passenger compartment 3 by means of a fire protection bulkhead 5 forming part of the body 2. With reference also to Figures 2 and 3, the body 2 comprises two side members 6 joined together by a cross member 7 disposed at the bulkhead 5 and defining an aeration duct 8.Conveniently, the cross member 7 is covered on the outside by a grid 9, and carries at least one connection 10 for a known windscreen wiper, not shown. The passenger compartment 2 is frontwardly bounded by a windscreen 11, which extends at its base from the cross member 7 and at its sides from uprights 12 which define side door openings 13. The fire protection bulkhead 5 is constructed of welded pressed sheet metal and comprises a lower substantially flat element 14 which frontwardly bounds the floor of the passenger compartment 2, and an upper cup shaped element 15 having its concavity facing the passenger compartment 2 and its convexity extending into the engine compartment 4. Specifically, the element 15 comprises two opposing substantially flat symmetrical side portions 16 and a central portion 18 provided with said concavity, which extends towards the engine compartment 4 and juts towards this latter beyond the lower element 14. The element 15 is fixed lowerly to the element 14, preferably by welding, and is welded upperly to the cross member 7. The vehicle 1 is provided inside the passenger compartment 3 with a dash panel 17 constituted by a support cross member 19 to be rigidly but removably fixed to the body 2 inside the passenger compartment 3 in a position facing the bulkhead 5. In particular, the cross member 19 is constituted by a rectilinear box beam of substantially rectangular cross section provided with opposing ends 20 Figure 2 arranged for fixing by screws 21 to respective brackets 22 formed in one piece with the body 2 and disposed at the level of the element 15. The cross member 19 is provided with cable passage holes and or weight reducing holes 23 and is arranged to support a steering column 24 and a pedal board 25 Figure 4 , which are both mounted rigid with a support element 26 for the steering column 24, mounted rigid in its turn with the cross member 19 by bolts 27.The steering column 24 and pedal board 25 are thus rigid with the cross member 19 and are fixed to the body 2 by means of this latter. The element 26 is provided with a lower end 28 arranged for bolting to the element 14 and supporting a bracket 29 disposed in line with the bulkhead 5 on the same side as the passenger compartment 3, and extending above the element 26 in a position facing one of the portions 16 of the upper element 15. The upper element 15 and the cross member 19 define inside the passenger compartment 3 a front housing compartment 30 for accessory devices of any type. In particular, in the illustrated example, the compartment 30 is arranged to contain a servo brake 31, particularly but not exclusively of the vacuum type, and an air conditioning and ventilation device 32 for the passenger compartment 3. The servo brake 31 is supported indirectly by the cross member 19 by being fixed to the bracket 29, whereas the air conditioner 32 is directly supported by the cross member 19 by means of one or more brackets 33 Figure 1 . In addition, the cross member 19 is arranged to support both any other device which can be housed in the compartment 30, and an instrument panel 34 Figure 1 which closes the compartment 30 in the direction of the passenger compartment 3 above the cross member 19. In particular, the instrument panel 34 rests on the air conditioning device 32 and is therefore supported indirectly by the cross member 19. With reference to figure 4 the servo brake 31 comprises a pump 35, a buffer vessel 36 and a control device 37, which are mounted rigid with each other. The control device 37 and the vessel 36 are housed inside the accessories compartment 30, whereas the pump 35 is housed in the engine compartment 4 in a seat 38 provided on that surface 39 of the portion 16 associated with the bracket 29 which faces the engine compartment 4.In the illustrated example both the side portions 16 are provided with a seat 38 so that the vehicle 1 is suitable for mounting either a right hand drive or a ipft hynH drive according to whether the element 26 carrying the steering column 24, servo brake 31 and pedal board 25 is mounted on the cross member 19 at the one or the other of the side portions 16. The seat 38 carrying the pump 35 is provided with a through hole 40 formed in the element 15 in a position corresponding with the servo brake 31 and able to allow the pump 35 to pass through it from the compartment 30 to the engine compartment 4.The hole 40 is obviously provided with a seal gasket 41 mounted between the bracket 29 and the end 42 at which the pump 35 is fixed to this latter. lhe pump 35 is mechanically supported by the bvracket 29, to which it is fixed on the side facing the engine compartment 4, whereas on the opposite side the bracket 29 carries the buffer vessel 36. In this manner, the mechanical stresses produced by the operation of the pump 35 are totally absorbed by the bracket 29 without acting on the buffer vessel 36, which can thus be constructed of a material of low cost and low mechanical strength, for example a plastics material, as it does not have to be load bearing. Because of its curved shape and its concavity, the central portion 18 is able to house part of the air conditioning device 32, and enables the compartment 30 to be enlarged by occupying part of the space normally reserved to the engine compartment 4. With reference to Figure 5, there is shown in detail the dash panel 17, in which all the elements are supported by the cross member 19. More in detail, the cross member 19 is arranged for diiet L y supporting the steering column 24 and the pedal board 25 of which pedals 44, 45, 46 are shown for driving accelerator, brake and clutch respectively so connecting them to each other in order to form a self supporting unit or sub assemblyt 47,which can be assembled separately from the vehicle 1 and then be mounted inside the passenger compartment 3, rigid iwith the body 2, by means of the ends 20 of the cross member 19 see also Figure 2 . The pedal board 25 and steering column 24 are both mounted rigid with a beam type support element 48 positioned perpendicular to the cross member 19 and provided with respective brackets 49 to be fixed rigid with the element 48, preferably by welding, at its upper edges 50. The brackets 49 are arranged for removable fixing, by means of screws, not shown, to the lower part 52 of the cross member 19, in any position along the axis of this latter and preferably on a portion of the cross member 19 close to one or other of the ends 20, at choice. Consequently the element 48 is fixed rigidly to the cross member 19 in a position below this latter, and thus the pedal board 25 and steering column 24 become directly mounted on the cross member 19, and fixed to the body 2 exclusively by means of this latter.In the particular example illustrated, the cross member 19 also carries a bracket 53 for supporting the servo brake 31, which is controlled by the pedal 45 by means of a lever system 54 supported by a pin 55 carried by the brtj 9. The instrument panel 34 comprises an upper element 56 and a lower element 57 which face each other and are arranged to define ducts 58 for aerating the passenger compartment 3, and frontal elements 59 and 60 which engage with the elements 56 and 57 in order to close the ducts 58 towards the passenger compartment 3, and define, extending towards these latter, an object compartment 61 and an instrument compartment 62. The instrument panel 34 is completed by finishing elements 63 and aeration ports 64 and object trays 65 and is preferably mounted directly on the cross member 19 so that it is supported by this latter instead of directly by the body 2.It can be fixed to the cross member 19 by screws, not shown, or be supported by a ventilation device 66 possibly also comprising air conditioning of any known type, to which it is fixed by a conveyiny element 67 mounted on ports 68 of the device 66. This latter is itself fixed on the cross member 19, which is therefore arranged to support both the device 66 and the instrument panel 34, these thus being fixed thereby to the body 2. Finally, the dash panel 17 is completed by a covering 69 for the steering column 24. The dash panel 17 is constructed in the following manner. Firstly, the cross member 19 is formed by bending and welding sheet metal and the instrument panel 34 is formed, on a different line, by moulding the elements 5, 57, 59, 60, 63, 65 and 41, and assem bl ing them using adhesives and or screws. The pedal board 25 and steering column 24 are then assembled on the element 48 and this latter is then fixed to the cross member 19 by means of the brackets 49, to form a self supporting unit 47.During this assembly operation, the dash panel 17 can be arranged either for right hand drive or for left hand drive without making any modification to the structure of the body 2, which is assembled separately on a different assembly line. In this respect, if the element 48 is mounted on that half of the cross member 19 corresponding to the left end 20 Figure 5 , a dash panel with left hand drive is obtained, whereas by simply mounting the element 48 in a position corresponding with the right end 20 a dash panel with right hand drive is obtained without any structual modification. Any accessories are mounted on the cross member 19 at this point, such as the servo brake 31, which can be thus immediately connected to the pedal 45 and tested, and the device 66, after which the instrument panel 34 is placed on the cross member 19 and fixed to the device 66 and or directly to the cross member 19.The instrument panel 34 is the only component of the dash panel 17 which requires structural modification to pass from left hand drive to right hand drive, this modification being easily done by changing the form of the moulds, and without modifying any load bearing parts of the dash panel 17 or body 2. Finally, the self supporting unit 47 obtained by assembling the various elements on the cross member 9 is s mount ed on tile vehicle 1 by a single operation consisting of inserting the unit 47 into the passenger compartment 3 and then fixing merely the cross member 19 to tie brackets 22 in a position facing the bulkhead 5, using the screws 21. Tltis operation is rapid and simple, and can be carried out on the assembly line either manually or automatically, witilOUt the need for the assembly personnel to assume uncomfortable positions or enter the passenger compartment 3 in order to fix the ends 20, as this operation can be easily carried out from the outside through the door openings. Moreover, in order to make subsequent stylistic modifications to the instrument panel 34 it is not necessary to carry out any work on the body 2, as often happens in the case of current vehicles, it being merely necessary to replace the instrument panel 34 as a block. Finally, if repair work has to be carried out on the body for example after an accident it is a very simple and rapid operation to remove the dash panel 17 by extracting it completely from the vehicle, and then to remount it when the repair has been made. By examining the vehicle 1, it is possible to see that the combination of the cross member 19 with the particular configuration of the fire protection bulkhead 5 anables a large compartment to be formed between this latter and the vehicle instrument panel for housing any vehicle auxiliary device, and capable even of containing air conditioning devices of high capacity and thus of large overall dimensions, which in non vehicles could not be installed other than by costly and complicated modifications to the load bearing structures of the vehicle body.The hous ing compartment obtained in this manner is also suitable for housing the vehicle servo brake, either to the right or to the left of the air conditioner, and in particular those servo brake elements which are not sub tantially subject to faults, whereas the servo brake pump, on which frequent maintenance work is necessary, is disposed on the engine compartment side in an easily accessible position, in that it is shielded by the convexity of the portion 18. Finally, the present invention enables a vehicle to be provided which is already suitable for equipping for either right hand or left hand drive without appreciable modification.In this respect, in order to arrange the vehicle for normal left hand drive it is necessary only to mount the element 26 on the cross member 19 towards that end 20 which faces the left hand lateral portion 16 of the element 15, and form the hole 40 in the seat 38 of this latter element. In contrast, to obtain a vehicle with riyht hand drive it is necessary only to mount the element 26 towards the end associated with the right hand lateral portion 16 of the element 15, and to form the hole 40 in this latter. If the hole 40 is provided in the left hand lateral portion 16 by virtue of the mass production process, it is necessary only to close this hole with a suitable cover. From the description it is apparent that modi ficet .ons cnn bc made to the vel icle constructed in accordance with the present invention, but without leaving the scope of the inventive idea.
