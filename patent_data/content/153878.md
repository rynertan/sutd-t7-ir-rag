## Description
The present invention relates to a device for storing a discrete quantity of liquid for use with a medical syringe, the device being of the type having a chamber to store the liquid, and a pair of communicating means communicating respectively between the chamber and the syringe reservoir, and the chamber and a needle. In many cases, it is important to be able to inject intravenously a discrete quantity of liquid rapidly into a patient. It is also important that mixing of the discrete quantity of liquid with the patient s blood and or a driving liquid, should be kept to a minimum. For example, certain drugs, for example, anaesthesiology drugs may cause damage to the peripheral veins. Thus, it is important where such drugs are injected into a peripheral vein, that it should be delivered through the peripheral vein into the main blood pool of the patient as quickly as possible. Another case in which it is essential that a discrete quantity of liquid be injected rapidly into a patient, is in the case of a bolus injection where a radionuclide liquid is injected intravenously and is directed to, for example, the heart or other organ to enable nuclear imaging or counting to be made of the heart. It is particularly important that the discrete quantity of radionuclide should be delivered to the heart with the minimum amount of mixing with the blood or the driving liquid used with the bolus. Where mixing takes place, it will be appreciated that the imaging or counting will be much less clear and the counting of lower statistical significance than where the fluid is retained in a discrete quantity. In general, bolus injections are delivered by pushing the radionuclide liquid through the venous system with a driving liquid. A typical driving liquid is a saline solution. One way of doing this is to connect an intravenous needle to one port of a three way valve. The other two ports are respectively connected to a syringe in which the bolus radionuclide liquid is stored, and a second syringe in which the driving liquid. generally saline solution, is stored. The valve is set initially so that the first syringe with the radionuclide is connected to the intravenous needle, and the radionuclide is dispensed from the syringe through the intravenous needle. The valve is then immediately switched over to connect the saline solution syringe to the intravenous needle, and the radionuclide is then flushed through the veins by delivering the saline solution rapidly from the syringe into the vein. Unfortunately, this technique is cumbersome, and in general requires two people to operate it, one to operate the radionuclide syringe, and the other to operate the driving fluid syringe. Another very important problem that arises with this technique is that it is extremely difficult to have the saline solution following immediately after the radionuclide liquid, and thus mixing of the radionuclide with the blood occurs very often before the saline solution is delivered into the vein. Furthermore, it has been found in the past that using this technique also causes undesirable mixing between the radionuclide liquid and the saline solution. Thus, by the time the radionuclide is delivered to the organ which is being examined, in general the heart, it has mixed considerably with both the blood and the saline solution, and thereby accurate nuclear imaging cannot be achieved. Another known device for delivering a bolus injection is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,364,376. This device comprises a bolus retainer which is essentially a cylindrical member which forms a chamber in which the bolus liquid is stored. A needle is attached to one end and a valve is attached to the other end. A syringe is initially connected to the valve and the valve is opened to the bolus chamber. Radionuclide is then drawn into the bolus chamber, and the valve closed. A syringe is then filled with a driving liquid generally saline solution, and reconnected to the valve. The valve is then opened and the driving liquid is pumped into the bolus chamber, which in turn delivers the bolus and driving liquid into the patient s vein. The problem with this device is that the bolus chamber tends to be relatively long, and thus leads to a very cumbersome device. This is a particular problem, since it is generally necessary to shield the bolus chamber with a heavy lead radiation shield to protect the doctor or nurse from radiation. Thus, this is an extremely awkward device to handle, and because of this, can cause the needle to move around in the patient s arm, thereby causing considerable pain and discomfort, and in many instances can cause the needle to project right through the vein and into tissue. This, it will be appreciated, is a very serious problem. A further disadvantage of this device is that because of the construction of the bolus chamber, it has been found that considerable mixing of the bolus liquid and the driving liquid takes place in the chamber. Thus, by the time the radionuclide reaches the patient s heart it is well diluted and nuclear imaging is most inaccurate. US A 4,044,758, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, describes a device for use in cholangiography for delivering two fluids into the bile duct of an individual. This device comprises a syringe having a reservoir and a plunger slidable within the reservoir for discharging liquid from the reservoir. A floating barrier slidable within the reservoir defines a first compartment intermediate the barrier and an outlet end of the reservoir for retaining an irrigation liquid and a second compartment intermediate the barrier and the plunger for retaining a liquid contrast medium, such as for example, a medium which would be opaque to X rays. A needle extending from the syringe outlet into the reservoir punctures the barrier when it has been moved by the plunger adjacent the syringe outlet so that the second compartment then communicates with the syringe outlet. A catheter having a distal end, a proximal end and a lumen extending through the catheter is connected by its proximal end to a valve which is in turn connected to the syringe outlet. The distal end of the catheter is connected to the bile duct of the individual. The valve selectively connects the reservoir with the catheter or a receptacle for receiving excess liquid from the compartments of the reservoir. In use, with the valve connecting the catheter to the syringe reservoir, as the plunger is depressed saline solution is discharged from the first compartment through the catheter. When sufficient saline solution has been delivered through the catheter to the individual, the valve is switched over so that further depression of the plunger into the syringe reservoir discharges the remaining saline solution into the receptacle. On engaging the needle, the barrier is punctured and the valve is switched over to connect the catheter to the syringe reservoir, and thus further depression of the plunger discharges the liquid contrast medium from the second compartment through the catheter. US A 2,515,956, on which the preamble of claim 9 is based, discloses a syringe having a reservoir and two plungers operable within the reservoir. One plunger is of large diameter for drawing in and discharging relatively large quantities of liquid into and out of the syringe reservoir. The other plunger is of relatively small diameter to allow small quantities of liquid to be accurately drawn into or discharged from the reservoir. In one embodiment of the invention, the plungers are mounted side by side longitudinally in the reservoir, one plunger being slidable relative to the other. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a bore communicating with the reservoir in the syringe extends longitudinally through the larger diameter plunger and the smaller diameter plunger is slidable within the bore in the larger plunger. There is therefore a need for a device which overcomes the problem of known devices for delivering bolus injections, as well as known devices for delivering any discrete quantity of liquid into the body. The present invention is directed towards providing such a device. The invention overcomes the problems of known devices by virtue of the fact that the invention provides a device for storing a discrete quantity of liquid for use with a medical syringe and needle, the device comprising a body member having a chamber formed by a passageway for storing the liquid, and a pair of communicating means for communicating the passageway respectively with a reservoir of the syringe and the needle, wherein the body member comprises a core member and the passageway is formed by an elongated non linear groove extending round the periphery of the core member, and a cylindrical member extends round the core member to close the groove. The advantage of the invention is that by virtue of the fact that the passageway is non linear, it may be convoluted, tortuous, or may return on itself, thereby providing a relatively short device which makes it readily easily handleable by a person administering the injection and in the case where the device is used for delivering radionuclides, a simple radiation shield may be placed around the device. Preferably, the groove is a helical groove. This leads to a particularly short device which can readily easily be used, and also can be relatively easily and cheaply manufactured. In another embodiment of the invention, the groove is of relatively small cross sectional area. An advantage of this is that it further reduces the possibility of mixing between the discrete quantity of liquid and a driving liquid which may be used to deliver the discrete quantity of liquid. Preferably, one communicating means is provided by a female connecting member extending from one end of the body member for engaging a luer or record male connector extending from the syringe, and the other communicating means is provided by a male connecting member extending from the other end of the body member for engaging a luer or record female connector of the needle, the male and female connecting members communicating with the groove. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that the device is relatively compact and easy to use, and a small but effective radiation shield may be placed around the device during handling. Advantageously, a radiation shield is provided to surround the body member and extends substantially the length of the body member. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it leads to a device which is relatively safe for use by a doctor or nurse. In a further embodiment of the invention, the radiation shield is detachable from the body member, and is retained by a releasable clamping means. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that where necessary or desirable, the device may be used without the radiation shield. The invention also provides a syringe comprising a barrel wall forming an elongated reservoir, and a plunger mounted in the reservoir and movable through the reservoir for discharging fluid from the reservoir through an outlet, wherein a core member is mounted in the reservoir between the plunger and the syringe outlet, the cross sectional area of the core member defining the cross sectional area of the reservoir, a chamber being formed by an elongated non linear tortuous passageway is provided in the core member extending from an inlet at one end of the core member which communicates with the reservoir to an outlet at the other end of the core member which communicates with the syringe outlet, so that on movement of the plunger in the reservoir, fluid is drawn into or discharged from the reservoir through the chamber. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that the device is mounted within a syringe, and accordingly, further reduces the overall length of the combined syringe and device. This, it will be appreciated, leads to further improvement in the ease of handling the device. In one embodiment of the invention, the passageway is provided by a helical groove formed around the periphery of the core member. Additionally, the invention provides a syringe comprising a primary reservoir and a primary plunger mounted in the primary reservoir and movable through the primary reservoir for discharging fluid from the primary reservoir, a secondary reservoir communicating with the primary reservoir and a secondary plunger mounted in the secondary reservoir and movable through the secondary reservoir for discharging fluid from the secondary reservoir to the primary reservoir, wherein a core member is mounted in the primary reservoir between the plunger and an outlet from the primary reservoir, the cross sectional area of the core member defining the cross sectional area of the primary reservoir, a chamber being formed by an elongated non linear tortuous passageway is provided in the core member extending from an inlet at one end of the core member which communicates with the primary reservoir to an outlet at the other end of the core member which communicates with the outlet from the primary reservoir, so that on movement of the plunger in the primary reservoir fluid is drawn into or discharged from the primary reservoir through the passageway. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it provides a syringe which has a relatively large volume reservoir, and yet permits liquid to be withdrawn into the reservoir accurately and sensitively. Additionally, where the device according to this embodiment of the invention is used for a bolus injection or administering a drug, the radionuclide liquid or drug can be withdrawn into the reservoir with particular accuracy and sensitivity. This is very important in the case of a bolus injection, or the administration of certain drugs, particularly those with certain toxic effects. In another embodiment of the invention, the passageway is provided by a helical groove formed around the periphery of the core member. In a further embodiment of the invention, a secondary syringe forms the secondary reservoir and the secondary plunger, the secondary syringe being releasably mounted in the primary plunger. The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it leads to a relatively easily manufactured and used device, and allows accurate drawing up of a small volume of the liquid. A further advantage of this feature of the invention is that it permits the driving liquid to be withdrawn into the primary reservoir without the secondary syringe mounted in the plunger. And furthermore, and a particularly important advantage, is that it permits the discrete quantity of liquid and driving fluid to be delivered to the patient with the secondary syringe removed from the primary plunger. This leads in many cases to a more easily managed device. The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of some preferred embodiments thereof, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to the drawings, and initially to Figs. 1 to 5, there is provided a device according to the invention, indicated generally by the reference numeral 1, for use with a medical syringe 2 and needle 3, for storing a discrete quantity of fluid for injection into the body. In this case, the device 1 is ideally suited for administering a bolus injection. Before describing the device the syringe and needle will first be described. The syringe 2 comprises a barrel 4 which forms a reservoir 5. A plunger 6 delivers liquid from the reservoir 5. The needle comprises a hub 7 of plastics material with a stainless steel cannula 8 having a pointed tip 9 extending from the hub 7. The device 1 comprises a body member 10 having a core member 11 of plastics material surrounded by a cylindrical sleeve 12 of clear plastics material. A non linear tortuous liquid path for storing the bolus liquid is provided by a hellcal groove 15 formed around the periphery of the core member 11. The sleeve 12 forms a seal around the periphery of the core member 11, thereby preventing fluid leaks between adjacent turns of the helical groove 15. Communicating means to connect the groove 15 to the syringe and needle, are provided by female and male connector members 17 and 18 extending from the ends of the core member 11. Both members 17 and 18 are connected to the groove 15 by axial bores 19 which extend through the connector members into the core member 11, and lateral bores 20, which extend transversely across the core member to connect the axial bores 19 to the ends of the groove 15. The female connector member 17 is of plastics material, and is moulded integrally with the core member, and is provided with a luer recess 21 to engage a corresponding male luer connector 22 on the syringe 2. The male connecter member 18 also of plastics material and moulded integrally with the core member, has an external luer taper 23 to engage a female taper 24 of the hub 7 of the needle 3. A radiation shield 27 to protect the person administering the injection, is releasably mounted on the device 1. The shield 27 comprises a thick walled barrel 28 of lead. An inspection glass 29 is provided in the barrel 28, to permit the user to see the liquid in the groove 15. The glass is a heavy lead impregnated glass. The barrel 28 is secured to the body member 10 by a compressible washer 30 mounted in an annular groove 31 at the end of the barrel 28. The compressible washer 30 is compressed by a threaded end cap 32 which engages threads 33 on the barrel 28. On tightening, the end cap 32 acts on a steel washer 34 which bears against the compressible washer 30, thereby squeezing the washer in a radial direction to engage the cylindrical sleeve 12 of the device 1. To assist a user, finger grips 35 are provided on the side of the end cap 32. In use, the device 1 is attached to the syringe 2 and needle 3. The needle is immersed in a saline solution, which is drawn through the needle, and in turn through the helical groove 15, and into the reservoir 5 of the syringe 2. When a sufficient quantity of saline solution has been drawn into the syringe 2, usually, the syringe is just about full of saline solution, the needle 3 is then immersed in the radionuclide for the bolus injection. This is usually carried out behind a protective screen, or in a protected preparation area. The required amount of radionuclide is then drawn in through the needle, and into the helical groove 15 of the device 1. The quantity of bolus fluid drawn into the device 1 can readily easily be measured by counting the number of turns of the groove filled with the bolus. Each turn corresponds to a specific volume of fluid. Verification that the correct quantity of radionuclide has been drawn up is obtained by placing the device into a radiation measuring device. The radiation shield 27 is then fitted in place and the device removed from behind the screen. The device is then ready for use. The needle is inserted into a vein in the arm or any other suitable position of a patient, and by rapidly depressing the plunger 6 of the syringe 2, the bolus is administered to the patient, and the saline solution rapidly drives the bolus to the desired location, normally, the heart, to permit a radiation scan of the heart to be made. In certain cases it may be preferable between drawing in the saline solution and the bolus liquid, to draw in a small quantity of air to act as a barrier in the groove 15 between the saline solution and the bolus liquid. Additionally, when the desired quantity of bolus has been drawn in, it may also in certain cases by advantageous to draw in a further small quantity of air to act as a barrier between the patient s blood and the bolus fluid. By virtue of the fact that the boundary between the bolus liquid and saline solution is in the groove 15 of the device 1, mixing between the saline solution and the bolus does not occur. Indeed, where a small quantity of air is drawn in as a barrier between the two, this further avoids mixing of the two liquids. Furthermore, by virtue of the fact that mixing of the bolus fluid and the driving fluid, namely, the saline solution, is avoided in the device 1, the only mixing that can occur will be subsequently in the vein of the patient. Since the bolus is normally driven rapidly along the vein, the amount of mixing between the saline solution and the bolus is thus minimised. It has been found in devices known heretofore that considerable mixing between the bolus and driving fluid took place. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that the bolus is retained in a small discrete volume in the device, this also assists in avoiding subsequent mixing of the bolus with the patient s blood. It has also been found that by drawing in a further small quantity of saline solution into the groove 15 of the device 1 after the bolus liquid has been drawn in, the second quantity of saline solution acts as a buffer between the patient s blood and the radionuclide in use. By virtue of the fact that the radionuclide is trapped between the saline solution, in other words, a small quantity of saline solution is provided at the beginning of the radionuclide, and the large driving quantity of saline solution is provided at the end, the radionuclide remains substantially in one homogeneous quantity, and does not disperse and mix with the patient s blood. Thus, it will be appreciated that when the radionuclide reaches the heart it will still be in a discrete quantity, and will then fill the chambers of the heart or other organ being examined, thereby permitting active radionuclide imaging or other imaging of the heart or other organ. In fact, it will be appreciated that if desired small quantities of air may be provided between the two quantities of saline solution and the radionuclide. This, it is envisaged, will further avoid mixing of the radionuclide with the saline solution. A further and very important advantage of the invention, is that by virtue of the fact that the liquid path is tortuous, in other words, in this case formed by a helical groove, the device is short and compact. One of the problems with devices known heretofore is that the length of the device was far too long to allow easy manipulation of the device by the person administering the bolus, particularly if a radiation shield was used on the device. Referring now to Figs. 6 and 7, there is illustrated a device 60 according to another embodiment of the invention. In this case, the device 60 is mounted in the reservoir 61 of a syringe 62 also according to the invention. The syringe 62 will be described in detail below. The device 60 comprises a body member, in this case formed by a core member 63. The liquid path is formed by a helical groove 64 on the periphery of the core member 63. The arrangement of the groove 64 and the core member 63 is substantially similar to the core member 11 of the embodiment of the invention described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. The core member 63 is a tight fit in the reservoir 61 and the barrel wall 68 of the syringe 62, closes the groove 64 and ensures that leakage will not take place between adjacent turns of the helical groove 64. An inlet 65 to the groove 64 forms a communicating means between the groove 64 and the reservoir 61. An outlet 66 from the groove 64 forms a communicating means between the groove 64 and a needle 67 on the syringe 62. In this case, the syringe 62 is essentially a primary syringe which forms the primary reservoir 61. A secondary syringe 70 forming a secondary reservoir 71, is mounted in a primary plunger 72 of the primary syringe 62. The diameter of the secondary syringe is less than that of the primary syringe. The secondary syringe 70 permits small volumes of liquid to be accurately and sensitively drawn into either the syringe or the helical groove 64 of the device 60. The primary plunger 72 comprises a top plate or disc 73 and bottom disc 74 joined by four longitudinal ribs 75, all of plastics material moulded integrally. A stopper 76 mounted on the bottom disc 74 sealably engages the barrel wall 68 for drawing in and pumping out liquid from the primary reservoir 61. A hole 78 is provided in the top disc 73 to accommodate the secondary syringe 70. A short needle 79 on the secondary syringe 70 extends through the bottom disc 74 and the stopper 76, to communicate with the primary reservoir 61. The secondary syringe 70 is thus secured in the primary plunger 72. A secondary plunger 80 is provided in the secondary syringe 70. In use, when the syringe 62 and device 60 are for use in delivering a bolus injection, the needle 67 of the primary syringe 62 is immersed in a saline solution, and the primary plunger 72 is withdrawn to draw saline solution through the groove 64 of the device 60 into the primary reservoir 61, thus substantially filling the primary reservoir 61 with the desired quantity of saline solution. During this operation, the secondary plunger 80 is in the depressed position. The needle is then immersed in the radionuclide bolus solution, and the desired amount of radionuclide is withdrawn into the groove 64 of the device 60 by withdrawing the plunger 60 of the secondary syringe 70. Because of the fact that the secondary syringe is of considerably smaller bore than the primary syringe, the radionuclide liquid can be drawn in much more accurately and sensitively than if one were to draw it in using the primary plunger of the primary syringe. If desired, a further small quantity of saline solution may be drawn in by the secondary plunger to act as a buffer between the radionuclide and the patient s blood. The syringe and device 60 is then ready for administering the bolus to a patient. The needle 67 is inserted in the vein of the arm or any other suitable vein of the patient, and the primary plunger 72 and secondary plunger 80 are rapidly depressed, thereby rapidly delivering the radionuclide into the vein of the patient. The advantage of having the secondary syringe is that it leads to an extremely sensitive apparatus. It permits the radionuclide to be drawn into the liquid path of the device with precision. This is because of the fact that the secondary syringe has a relatively narrow diameter. In fact, it will be appreciated that the narrower the diameter of the secondary syringe, the more sensitive the device will be. Although not illustrated, a radiation shield may be provided around the outer lower portion of the syringe barrel adjacent the device 60, to reduce radiation exposure to a doctor or nurse delivering the injection. A radiation shield substantially similar to that described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5, could be used. The radiation shield would be fitted to the syringe after the radionuclide had been drawn into the device 60. Indeed, in certain cases it is envisaged that if desired the radiation shield could extend over the entire length of the primary syringe, although it is felt that this should not be necessary, since the radionuclide is retained in the device 60. Referring now to Fig. 8, there is illustrated a syringe 85, also according to the invention, and a device 60 mounted in the syringe 85. The syringe 85 and device 60 are substantially similar to those just described with reference to Figs. 6 and 7, and similar components are identified by the same reference numerals. The main difference between the syringe 85 and the syringe of Figs. 6 and 7, is that the secondary syringe 70 is releasably mounted in the primary plunger 72 of the primary syringe 85. In this case, a slot 86 is provided in the top disc member 73 to releasably engage the barrel of the secondary syringe 70. Pips not shown are provided in the slot 86 so that the secondary syringe 70 is engagable with snap fit action. A hole 87 is provided in the bottom disc 74 to accommodate the needle 79 of the secondary syringe. In use, it is envisaged that the primary and secondary syringes 85 and 70, will be sold disassembled. To draw up the saline solution, the primary plunger 72 without the secondary syringe 70 mounted, is withdrawn and saline solution is drawn into the primary reservoir 61. When the desired amount of saline solution has been drawn in, the secondary syringe 70 is then mounted in the primary plunger. The needle is aligned with the hole 87, and the syringe barrel is engaged in the slot 86. The secondary syringe 70 is then pressed downwards in the primary plunger 72, so that the needle 79 punctures the stopper 76 of the primary plunger 72, thus the secondary reservoir 71 of the secondary syringe 70 communicates with the primary reservoir 61. The secondary plunger 80 is then withdrawn to draw in the desired amount of radionuclide into the liquid passageway 64 of the device 60. When the desired amount of radionuclide has been drawn in, the secondary syringe 70 is then removed from the primary plunger 72 and the syringe 85 is then ready for injecting the patient. To dispense the radionuclide and driving liquid into the venous system, the primary plunger 72 is rapidly depressed, thereby dispensing the radionuclide and the saline solution. By virtue of the fact that the stopper of the primary plunger is of a relatively resilient material, it is effectively self sealing, and thus reseals the small puncture made by the secondary needle 79 of the secondary syringe 70. The advantage of having the secondary syringe disposable is that it in many cases makes the syringe more easily handleable. It will also be appreciated that while the secondary reservoir and syringe have been described as being mounted in the plunger of the primary syringe, this is not necessary. In certain cases, it is envisaged that the secondary syringe may be mounted externally of the primary syringe. Indeed, it is envisaged in other cases that the secondary syringe may in fact form the plunger of the primary syringe, and the reservoir of the secondary syringe would communicate with the reservoir of the primary syringe through a small bore in the stopper of the primary plunger. It will also be appreciated that while particular configurations and shapes of devices have been described, any other suitable shape or configuration could be used. For example, it is envisaged that the liquid passageway may be formed by means other than a helical groove. It will of course be appreciated that the cross sectional area of the liquid path may be any suitable or desired cross sectional area. It has been found in use that if the cross sectional area is in the range of 1.5 mm to 2.5 mm, particularly advantageous results have been achieved. However, it will be appreciated that the cross sectional area of the liquid path could be greater or lesser than these given areas. While in all the embodiments of the invention just described, the driving saline solution has been described as being drawn into the reservoir through the device, this is not necessary, and in certain cases it is envisaged that the saline solution may be drawn directly into the syringe and the device could then be mounted on the syringe and the small quantity of radionuclide could be drawn into the liquid path of the respective device by further withdrawing the plunger of the syringe, or in the case of the device of Figs. 9 and 10 by withdrawing the secondary plunger. In most cases it will be appreciated that the quantity of radionuclide drawn into the liquid passageway of the device can be measured either by measuring the amount the plunger has been withdrawn while drawing in the radionuclide or by counting the number of turns of the liquid passageway filled with the radionuclide. Usually the activity of the radionuclide will be checked by placing the syringe and device in a radiation dose calibrator. It has been found that a particularly important advantage of the invention is that by virtue of the fact that the device of the various embodiments of the invention is relatively short, and as already described, this results from the fact that the liquid path is formed by many turns of a helix, the device is particularly adaptable and easy to use. Furthermore, by virtue of the fact that the device is relatively short, a relatively robust device is provided. Thus, a bolus injection can be administered readily easily with minimal discomfort and pain to the patient. Furthermore, and most importantly, the fact that the device is relatively short and manoeuvreable allows it to be easily shielded, thus increasing radiation safety to the technician or person administering the dose. It is envisaged that while in the embodiments of the invention described the device and syringe have been manufactured from plastics material, and in general, of clear plastics material moulded, any other suitable material or forms of construction could be used. In fact, the helical groove could be either machined into the core member or could be formed during moulding of the core member. It will of course be appreciated that materials other than plastics material could be used for the core member. It will also be appreciated that while the radiation shield has been described in most embodiments of the invention as merely covering the device for storing the radionuclide, the radiation shield could, if desired, extend to cover both the syringe and the device, and in certain cases could extend further to cover at least portion of the needle. It will also of course be appreciated that radiation shields other than that described could be used. In certain cases it is envisaged that the radiation shield may be a fixed structure on the device, and it may not be releasable. Further, it is envisaged that the device according to the invention for storing the radionuclide, has been described as being mounted on a needle and a syringe, this is not necessary, the device in many cases may be manufactured and sold on its own without a syringe and needle. Further, it is envisaged in certain cases that the device may be preloaded with a radionuclide and sold with the radionuclide already preloaded. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that while in various embodiments of the invention, the method of drawing the radionuclide into the syringe has been described in certain cases with airlocks between the saline solution, this is not necessary, the radionuclide may be drawn in without having an airlock or airlocks as the case may be, between the radionuclide and the saline solution. Additionally, it will of course be appreciated that it is not necessary for a second quantity of saline solution to be drawn into the device to act as a buffer between the radionuclide and the blood. Needless to say, any other driving solution besides a saline solution, could be used. It is also envisaged that while the device has been described for use in a bolus injection, in other words, for storing and delivering a small quantity of radionuclide, the device could be used for any other purpose. It could be used for delivering a small discrete quantity of any type of liquid to a patient, either through the venous system or any other system. The small quantity of liquid could be driven by any suitable driving fluid. In general, however, it is envisaged that the driving liquid would be inert. Alternatively, the device could be used to deliver two or more liquids side by side with minimal mixing. A further important advantage of the device is that it permits a liquid, for example, a toxic drug, to be delivered rapidly through the vein and into the general systemic circulation. This will be particularly beneficial where it is important to get the drug quickly into the blood pool and major blood vessels and or organs, and away from the peripheral veins of the arm or other injection sight where the elements of the drug might lodge and cause toxic effects in the vein, or not be delivered fully, and thus not achieve maximum impact. It is well known that there are drugs which are locally toxic to peripheral veins, and thus, it would be essential to deliver the drug rapidly into the blood pool and major blood vessels or organs away from such peripheral veins. It will be appreciated that the present device can achieve this readily easily. Such drugs which may cause problems to peripheral veins are, for example, used in chemotherapy and also certain antibiotics. Indeed, in certain cases with antibiotics it has been found that only three injections may be given into a vein before the vein becomes useless for drug administration, due to the action of the drugs on the vein. However, by using the present invention the drug can be quickly flushed through the vein and the driving fluid, as well as having a flushing effect also may have a cleaning effect on the vein, thereby removing any traces of the drug in the vein into which the drug has been administered. Furthermore, the device may be advantageously used for delivering a small dose of an active drug of less than the capacity of the device, for example, one millimetre dose. It will of course be appreciated that it is not necessary to fill the liquid passageway of the device with the discrete quantity of liquid being administered. In many cases, only a few turns of the helix may be filled, indeed, in certain cases it is envisaged that only one, and indeed maybe less than one turn may be filled with the liquid being administered to the patient. Furthermore, as the secondary syringe allows small quantities of a drug to be drawn in precise quantities into the device, and the driving, solution ensures total delivery of the dosage, it has the further advantage that in virtually all cases where the device is used, the entire quantity of the discrete quantity of liquid, whether it is a drug, radionuclide or the like, will be delivered to the patient. Even where small residual amounts adhere as a result of surface tension to the wall of the liquid passageway, the driving liquid will remove any remaining traces of the drug, radionuclide or the like, and will accordingly deliver them into the patient s venous system. This, it will be appreciated, has considerable advantages over devices known heretofore, where in many cases, even using the smallest syringe, small quantities of a drug will be retained in the syringe, needle, and may even adhere to the plunger. This is a particular disadvantage when relatively small quantities of the drug or other liquid are being administered, as any residual amount of the drug or liquid remaining in the syringe will have a relatively large effect on the overall dose administered to the patient, and in many cases this may have extremely serious effects on the patient. Additionally, it will be appreciated that while the shield has been described as being of lead, any other high density metal, or other high density material could be used. Furthermore, other glass could be used, besides that described. While the driving liquid has been described in all the embodiments of the invention as a saline solution, any other suitable driving liquid could be used. In general, it is envisaged that it will be an inert solution. Additionally, it is envisaged that while the syringes which have been described with reference to Figs. 6 to 8, have been described as incorporating the device in the primary reservoir, this is not necessary. These syringes could be used without the device mounted in the primary reservoir, in which case it is envisaged that the device would be externally mounted, as described, for example, with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. In other words, the syringe of any of Figs. 6 to 8 could be used with any of the devices of the earlier Figures. It will also of course be appreciated that while the device which is illustrated mounted in the syringes of Fig. 6 to 8, has been described as having a liquid passageway provided by a helical groove, the passageway could be provided by any other non linear passageway, whether a convoluted, tortuous, or any other suitable construction. While the device and syringe have been described with a needle attached, it will be appreciated that any other means for injecting into a patient s vein could be used, for example, a scalp vein set, or a butterfly, which in general would include a needle and tube, or indeed any other means could be used.
