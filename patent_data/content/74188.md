# High pressure discharge lamps.

## Abstract
In a high pressure sodium discharge lamp it has been found that rectification can be prevented by ensuring the amalgam does not make electrical contact with the electrode 17 . To achieve this according to the invention a small shoulder member 11 is provided on the inside face of the end wall. Although the small height 1 effectively reduces the temperature differential between the bottom of the shoulder and the top 11a the necessary differential to prevent the amalgam condensing out the top of the shoulder member is maintained by ensuring the width W of the shoulder member is a predetermined minimum thickness.
