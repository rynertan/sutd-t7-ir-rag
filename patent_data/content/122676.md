## Description
Process for the quaternization of cephalin and N derivatives thereofThe invention relates to a process for the quaternization of phosphatidyl oxyethylamine and N derivatives thereof by conversion with methyl halogenide.Phosphatides of animal and vegetable origin contain, besides N free phosphatides and alpha and bta phosphatidic acids fatty acid esters of 1 or 2glyceryl phosphoric acids of the formulasEMI1.1 Alpha BÃ¨ta in which C0 R1 and C0 R2 are fatty acid radicals , esters of the phosphatidic acids with a aminoethanol, b l amino 2 hydroxy ethanoic acids serine and c 2hydroxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride choline of the following formulas in which only the alpha formulas are given a Phosphatidyl oxyethylamine cephalin EMI1.2 b Phosphatidyl serine serine cephalin EMI1.3 c Phosphatidyl choline lecithin EMI1.4 EMI2.1 Besides, there are also so called lysophosphatides, of which one of the two fatty acid radicals is lacking.The commercially available phosphatide products are mixtures of such phosphatides and contain moreover accompanying substances, such as glycerides, sterols and esters thereof.When using phosphatide mixtures, e.g. as emulsifiers for oil in water emulsions, which are used therapeutically, in foodstuffs or for dietetic purposes, it is important that the cephalin content should be low.In the patent and other literature there has been no lack of proposals for separating the various phosphatides by chromatographic separation methods, solvent fractionation or chemical processes.It is advantageous that before separation the lecithin content should be as high as possible. On the other hand, in the manufacture of enriched lecithin fractions from phosphatide mixtures also impoverished fractions, enriched in cephalin, are obtained, for which e market should be found.The lecithin content of phosphatide mixtures can be increased by conversion of the cephalin present therein into lecithin. The mixtures thus obtained can be used as such or as starting material for fractionation. By conversion of the cephalin, obtained in the impoverished fractions of the phosphatide separation, into lecithin, an increased amount of lecithin can be obtained.In US 2 373 686 it is proposed to convert cephalin and cephalin containing mixtures, such as oil free soy bean phosphatides, in ether solution with diazomethane or with methanal and methanoic acid . However, probably only dimethyl cephalins will be formed.This is confirmed in DE 22 26 291 and also in the corresponding US 3 862 968, according to which the methylation of cephalin and serine cephalin is carried out in two steps In the first step, by conversion with methanal and methanoic acid, the corresponding dimethyl compounds are obtained, which are quaternized with methyl iodide in the second step.Verkade, Proc. Kon. Acad. Wetenschappen B65, 164 165 1962 describes o benzyl dimethyl cephalin which has been methylated with methyl iodide. Slotboom et al. cf. Chem. Phys. Lipids 1, 317 336, 1967 , carried out the methylation of o benzyl dimethyl lysocephalin with methyl iodide in the presence of cyclohexylamine, from which lysolecithin was prepared. Stoffel et al. cf. Hoppe Seyler s Z. physiol. them. 352, 1058 1064 1971 described the methylation of dimethyl cephalins with labelled methyl iodide. Smith et al. cf. Lipids 13, 92 94 1978 methylated a certain cephalin into the corresponding lecithin with labelled methyl iodide in the presence of silver carbonate in tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, with a yield of 758. Patel et al. cf. Lipids 14, 596 597 1980 methylated cephalin from egg to lecithin with labelled methyl iodide in the presence of symmetric hexaoxacyclo octadecane and anhydrous potassium carbonate in benzene, also with a yield of about 75 . Without citing any literature formic acid it is asserted in the above patent specifications that there is only very incomplete methylation when cephalin is methylated with the aid of methyl iodide.It has now been found that conversion of cephalin into lecithin can simply occur by exhaustive methylation.The exhaustive methylation of ammonia and amines for the preparation of quaternary ammonium compounds is a process, which has been known for a long time. However, as appears from the literature mentioned, the situation with the phosphatides is not so simple as with the amines, which only carry hydrocarbon radicals.Smith el al. loc. cit. used the expensive silver carbonate for the methylation of cephalin with methyl iodide and as solvent tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile.Patel et al. loc. cit. used benzene. Such solvents must be removed completely if the products are to be used in foodstuffs or therapeutic products. When using methyl iodide also the iodide ion is incorporated in the product and this is generally not desirable.As appeared from tests, methylation is also possible with the very poisonous dimethyl sulphate, in which however, besides the desired quaternization product, the presence of its methyl ester was observed, which is to be dissociated, e.g. by boiling with a sodium iodide solution in acetone.The afore mentioned methylating agents are also less suitable because of their toxicity and their expensiveness. Moreover, it is not easy to remove any remaining methylating agent from the reaction product.In this specification by phosphatidyl oxyethylamine PE or cephalin is meant both cephalin and serine cephalin as well as the lyso derivatives of these com pounds and other derivatives in which one or both of the fatty acid residues have been replaced or modified, unless indicated otherwise. Similarly the indication phosphatidyl choline PC or lecithin is meant to include the corresponding quaternized compounds.It was surprisingly found that quaternization according to the invention of cephalin in a nearly pure condition and in cephalin containing mixtures with methyl chloride is an advantageous and technically well feasible method.Therefore, in accordance with the invention a process is provided for the preparation of quaternized phosphatidyl oxyethylamine and N derivatives thereof with methyl halogenide as methylating agent, characterized in that phosphatidyl oxyethylamine and or an N derivative thereof is converted with methyl chloride in the presence of a base. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. Phosphatides from animal products, such as egg or brain, or from phosphatides obtained in the desliming of vegetable crude oils can for example be used as starting material. Treated phosphatides, such as desugared and or de fatted phosphatide or enriched or impoverished fractions can also be used as starting material. Both lysocephalin and already partially methylated phosphatides, such as dimethyl cephalin, can be also be quaternized according to the process of the invention.Methyl chloride at room temperature is a gas which, concentrated to a colourless liquid, is marketed in steel bottles. Its boiling point is 23.7eC. The gas has an ethereal, non irritating smell. Methyl chloride is comparatively cheap. The conversion can suitably be carried out in a stirred autoclave, for example in the following way The phosphatide or a phosphatide containing mixture is fed into the autoclave and the necessary amount of a base and preferably a solvent is added. The autoclave is closed and liquid methyl chloride is poured in via a pressure pipe. The amount of methyl chloride used is determined by weighing the storage vessel. The temperature of the reaction mixture is raised to 40 800C and the reaction mixture is stirred for 3 100 hours, during which the pressure rises to about 20 kg cm2. After the reaction has been completed, the pressure is reduced carefully to avoid overfoaming of the reaction composition.A base should be added to bind the releasing hydrogen chloride. Alkali hydroxides can be used. However, as the use of these bases may cause hydrolysis of the phosphatides, the use of alkali carbonates is preferred. The hydrogen carbonates are less suitable as no conversion is observed at temperatures of about 50 C. When alkali carbonates are used, lower temperatures can suitably be applied. Both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate are very suitable. The bases are preferably added in an aqueous solution, and more preferably in a concentrated solution, to facilitate subsequent drying. As the base is partially converted into chloride, the pH value of the mixture decreases during the reaction.It is believed that after conversion of carbonate into hydrogen carbonate, the pH is decreased in such a way that there is no further or only an incomplete binding of the hydrogen chloride.Although acid binding agents, such as magnesium oxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate should essentially be effective, they are not preferred because of their insolubility in water they would increase the reaction times and it might be questionable whether there would be a proper distribu tion in the reaction mass and, moreover, the presence of magnesium and calcium ions is not desirable for many applications.A solvent is not absolutely necessary for conversion.When, however, the starting material is solid or highly viscous, it is preferable to add a solvent. Any solvent which, together with the starting material, yields a flowable liquid, can be used. In doing so, it is not necessary for the phosphatides to be completely dissolved. Suitable solvents are glycerides, hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers and alcohols.Ethanol is preferred, as this may already be present in many phosphatides because of previous processes and, moreover, is subsequently easily removable without detrimental effects occurring when there is no complete removal. The presence of ethanol and water of the basic solution also decreases the risk of the hydroxyl groups of the phosphatides being methylated by the methyl chloride.For the conversion of cephalin into lecithin in theory 3 Mol of methyl chloride per Mol of cephalin is needed.Cephalin from soy bean phosphatide has an average molecular weight of 765. Thus, theoretically speaking, per kg of cephalin about 0.2 kg of methyl chloride should be added, whereby about 0.05 kg of hydrogen chloride is formed as by product. Per Mol of HC1 1 Mol of base should be added this means that, theoretically speaking, about 3 Mol of base per Mol of cephalin, corresponding to about 0.16 kg of NaOH, 0.22 kg of KOH, 0.42 kg of Na2C03 or 0.54 kg of K2C03 per kg of cephalin should be added.In practice, however, excess of methyl chloride will be used, which, however, is kept as small as possible, as at the end of the conversion the superfluous methyl chloride should be discharged from the autoclave and should be collected for environmental reasons. In practice also the smallest possible excess of base will be used, in which the complete binding of the hydrogen chloride and the desired pH value at the end of the reaction play a part. If only partial conversion of cephalin into lecithin is desired, smaller amounts of methyl chloride and base can be used.The required amounts depend on the amount of cephalin in the phosphatide mixture, which is to be converted and can therefore not be stated off hand. When the cephalin content is about 15 , in theory 3 , in practice between about 10 and 70 of methyl chloride and about 3 68 potassium carbonate or equivalent amounts of other bases, calculated on the weight of the phosphatide mixture, are added and optionally 10 500 ethanol can be used for liquefaction.The temperature at which the conversion is preferably carried out is between 40 and 80 cm Higher temperatures can be applied as far the equipment allows, but these are not necessary. At lower temperatures the reaction rate is rather low.Generally the reaction is continued until the pressure does not change substantially any more. Mostly periods of 7 100 hours are to be observed, as methyl chloride generally provides a slower reaction than the other methylating agents mentioned.During the analysis of the reaction product, the predicted intermediate products mono and dimethyl cephalin could not be identified. It is believed that, presumably because of their stronger basicity, these intermediate products are methylated more quickly than the cephalin itself. After cooling of the autoclave and letting off the pressure, the reaction product can be removed from it by pouring. Besides the quaternized products it contains the substances which have optionally been present from the start, such as inositol phosphatides, glycerides, sugar, etc., and the added compounds, such as base and solvent, and the inorganic chloride formed. The base can be neutralized, preferably with hydrochloric acid, and water and solvent can be removed by drying and or heating.If desired, the inorganic chloride can be removed by washing with water or by dissolving the reaction product in ethanolpetroleum ether mixtures and filtering the precipitated salt off. The dried product can be subjected to further treatment, e.g. de fatting with acetone or methyl acetate and or de sugaring, or the lecithin content can be further increased by other processes.In the above conditions the serine cephalin, which is often present in larger quantities in animal phosphatide mixtures, can also be quaternized. The amide nitrogen in N acyl cephalin and sphingomyelin is generally not affected. The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples using soy bean phosphatides as starting material. However, the invention is not restricted to phosphatides of this origin.Example 1 11.3 g of a de sugared, ethanol soluble soy bean phosphatide fraction, 49 g of ethanol 96 denatured with methanol and 3.2 g of a 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 2.8 NaOH of the phosphatide mixture added were introduced into a stirred autoclave 125 ml . The autoclave was connected with a bottle of methyl chloride 3 kg cm2 at room temperature. After an hour the valve was closed and the temperature was raised to 50 C, the initial pressure being 5.0 kg cm2. The mixture was then stirred for 8 hours the final pressure was 4.7 kg cm2. After cooling to room temperature, the pressure was reduced very carefully to avoid overfoaming of the reaction mixture. The pHvalue of the mixture had fallen from 10 to 6. The mixture was concentrated and dried in vacuo.A product was obtained in an amount of 10.2 g, which was dissolved in 20 ml petroleum ether and purified over 20 g silica gel. After washing with 100 ml petroleum ether, concentrating and drying, 5.3 g fat free endproduct was obtained.AnalysisPhosphatidyl choline PC 69.8Lysophosphatidyl choline 6.4Phosphatidyl oxyethylamine PE 1.9PC PE 37The PC PE ratio in the starting material was 5.Example 2As in Example 1, 70 g of the same starting material, 8 g ethanol and 12.2 g of a 30 potassium carbonate solution 5.28 K2C03 of the phosphatide mixture were converted with 50 g methyl chloride, during which the mixture was stirred for 18 hours. The final pH value was 7.5. When the reaction mixture was rinsed with ethanol, some KC1 was precipitated, which was filtered off. The dried product was defatted by washing with acetone lx and methyl ethanoate 3x at 40C.

The pH of the mixture fell from 9 to 7.After distribution over a mixture of.l part of ethanol and 2 parts of petroleum ether and water and defatting with acetone and methyl ethanoate, 33 g end product was obtained.Analysis 8Phosphatidyl choline 61.2Lysophosphatidyl choline 2.9Phosphatidyl oxyethylamine 0.6P 3.0PC PE 102The PC PE ratio in the starting material was 4 5.Example 4 62 g native soy bean phosphatide, 12.5 g ethanol and 10.2 g 258 potassium hydroxide solution 4.1 KOH per amount of phosphatide added were converted with methyl chloride as described in Example 1.
