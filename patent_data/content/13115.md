## Description
SYNERGISTIC HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION Certain sulfinyl and sulfonyl pyridine N oxides are taught as being effective herbicides. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,960,542, 4,019,893 and 4,050,921 incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, certain triazinones in particular, 4 amino 6 l,l dimethy lethyl 3 methyl thio2 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one are useful as herbicides. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,905,801 incorporated herein by reference. The triazonone is particularly effective in control of weeds in soybeans and potatoes. However, this herbicide does not control grass as well and is also relatively ineffective against broadleaf plants such as jimsonweed and morningglory. It has surprisingly been found that 2 1 2,5, dimethylphenyl ethylsulfonyl pyridene N oxide, when used in combination with 4 amino 6 l,l dimethylethyl 3methyl thio 1,2,4, triazin 5 4H one, is effective against certain grasses and broadleaf weeds notwithstanding the fact that, when used independently neither compound shows this activity. The ratio of pyridine N oxide to triazinone for effective results is about 0.5 to 1 to about 8 to 1. This invention relates to herbicidal compositions. in particular, relates to a combination of 2 1 2,5,di methylphenyl ethylsulfonyl pyridene N oxide, with certain triazinones. The z ridene N oxide useful in the practice of this invention has the general formula EMI2.1 The use and preparation of this compound is taught in U.S. Patent 3,960,542 incorporated herein by reference. The triazinone suitable for use in the practice is 4 amino 6 tertiary butyl 3 methylthic 1,2,3 triazin5 4H one having the general formula EMI2.2 The preparation and use of this triazinone is taught in U.S. Patent 3,905,801 incorporated herein by reference. As used in the syneryistic combination of this invention, the ratio of pyridine compound hereinafter referred to as Compound I to triazinone compound hereinafter referred to as Compound II can be about 0.5 to 1 to about 8 to 1 preferably about 1 to 1 to about 4 to 1, e.g. 2 to 1. Although the invention is described in terms of the activity of the N oxide triazinone combination in controlling jimsonweed and morningglory, the combination exhibits particularly broad and selective herbicidal activity in dicotyledonous crop cultures such as soybeans or potatoes. Illustrative examples of the weeds which may be controlled include monocots such as fox tail species Setaria , panicum species Panicum , crabgrass species Digitaria3, barnyard grass Echinochloa crus galli L.Beauv. , goosegrass Eleusine indica L. Gaertn , red rice Oryza sativa L. , johnsongrass Sorghum halepense L. Pers. , wild oats Avena fatua L. and dicots such as pigweed species Amaranthus , morningglory species Ipomea , jimsonweed Datura stramonium L. , common lambs quarters Chenopodium album L. , prickly sida Sida spinosa L , coffeeweed Daubentonia texana Pierce , sickle pod Cassia obtusifolia L. , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti Medic , mustard species Brassica , Pennsylvania smartweed Polygonum pensylvanicun L. and common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. . When used in its usual prior art application, the pyridine N oxide I is applied at about one half to about three pounds per acre more preferably about onehalf to about one pound per acre. The triasinone II is generally applied at about one quarter to about three quarters of a pound per acre. Surprisingly, although compound I is the predominant component of the combination of this invention, the combination is effective when used at about one quarter to about three quarters of a pound per acre. The combination of this invention exhibits excellent activity against dicotyledonous and monocolytedonous weeds without harming the crop and therefore can be used for selective weed control. The method of using the herbicidal combinations of this invention follows conventional practice and the chrmicdls are suitably applied as formulations in accord ance with conventional agriculatural practice, Thus, the composition may be impregnated on finely divided or granular inorganic or organic carriers such as attapulgite clay, sand, vermiculite, corn cobs, activated carbon or other granular carriers known to the art. The impregnated granules may then be spread on the soil. Similarly, the compositions may be formulated as a wettable powder by grinding it into a fine powder and mixing it with inactive powdered carriers as described above to which a surface active dispursing agent has been added. Typical powdered solid carriers are the various mineral silicates, e.g. mica, talc, pyrophyllite and clays. The wettable powder may then be dispersed in water and sprayed on the soil surface or weeds. Similarly, an emulsifiable concentrate may be prepared by dissolving the chemical in a solvent such as benzene, toluene or other aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added. The emulsifiable concentrate may then be dispersed in water and applied by spraying.Suitable surface active agents are well known to those skilled in the art and reference may be had to McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers, 1970,Allured Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey orHoffman et al U.S. patents 2,614,916, Cols. 2 to 4 and 2,547,724, Cols. 3 and 4, for examples of appropriate surface active agents. The concentration of active chemical in the formulation may vary widely, e.g. from 1 to 95. The concentration of active chemical in dispersions applied to the soil or foliage is almost invariably from 0.002 to 75. For use as a preemergence herbicide, the chemical is applied to soil which contains weed and crop seed either to the surface of the soil or incorporated into the upper one to three inches of soil .The composition may be employed individually or as a mixture of two or more known herbicidal chemicals. The synergistic activity of a combination can only be determined imperically since it is an unexpected result. The result to be expected from a given combination of two herbicides can be calculated as taught by Colby seeColby, S.R. Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations Weeds, 15, 20 22 1967 incorporated herein by reference. For clarity, the method is described briefly below If X damage by herbicide A when using p Kg ha andY damage by herbicide B when using q kg ha then E, the expected damage of herbicides A and B when using p and qKg ha is expressed by the equation E X Y XY 100 If the experimentally determined value of E exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is synergistic. As is shown in the following examples, the result obtained with the combination of this invention is indeed a synergistic one. EXAMPLE ITo illustra e the effectiveness of the descrize n composi tion, 50 wettable powder formulations of compounds I and were suspended in water at the rate of .Olg formulation per 200 ml water Aliqucts of various size from suspensions i ad II were combined and brought up to 80 ml.For example 10 ml suspension I was combined with 10 ml cf suspension II and then brought up to 80 ml of a ratio of 1 8 lb A I to 1 8 lb A II. For 1 8 lb A I to 1 4 lb A II , 10 ml I were added to 20 ml II and then brought up 80 ml.Preemergence greenhouse soil contained in 6 inch diameter pots was sown with seeds of jimsonweed and was drenched with 80 ml of the desired suspension. The percent control of weeds compared to untreated checks was determined four weeks after treatment. Table I shows the synergistic effect of the composition prepared in accordance with the above example.

The results are shown in Table II.

Similar tests on redroot pigweed, wild oats, green fox tail and barnyard grass showed that the combination was also effective in controlling these weeds. Although the herbicidal combination of this invention is preferably applied at a rate of 1 4 to 3 4 lb acre, the application rate may vary according to soil type, soil pH etc, At least 1 4 lb acre must be used, although as much as 25 pounds per acre may be used.Methods of adjusting application rate to conditions are within the knowledge of those skilled in the art.
