# A method and apparatus for target tracking.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling target tracking, in which the setting is made by distance and velocity incre ments. The velocity increment is calculated and supplied to the control by command from a push button 1 on the operating means of the target tracker. The velocity incre ment is selected proportional to the distance increment and inversely proportional to the measured time between two sequential reversals of the switch 1 on the operating means.

## Description
A MFTHOD AND APPARAIUS FOR TARGET TRACKINGFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method for controlling target tracking and apparatus for carrying out the method.DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ARTIn controlling target tracking, for example when controlling a sighting means for aiming a weapon on a moving target, it is known to the art to use rate control together with distance increments, see for example the patent specificsticn number 153 244, especiallyFigure 4 and the description applicable thereto. Target tracking is often carried out by an aimer who aims the sight laterally and in height. Up to now it has been usual, in the operation of the sighting means, that the quotient between distance and velocity increments has been a constant, which has had the diensicn of time and has therefore been called the Time constant T. Different target tracking tasks require different settings of said quotient.When tracking a rapid target at a short distan e with an anti aircraft weapon sight a low value of the Time constant T must be set, but when controlling a tracking mark in tracking targets on a radar Plan Position Indicator PPI where the targets only move slowly, setting to a considerably larger value is required. It is obvious to make said quotient settable to the value suitable for every task and for every aimer. However, it is rather difficult to select the setting value most suitable for every occasion.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, the time is measured between each correction made by the aimer, and the rate increment shall be in direct portion to the distance increment introduced and in inverse proportion to the measured time. For example, when tracking a target on the PPI of a radar installation, a joystick is used for controlling a tracking mark longitudinally and transversely, and when a set correction is to be introduced into the computing portion of the tracking means, this is ordered by the aimer. The distinguishing features for the invention are set forth in the characterizing portion of the accompanying patent claims.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn the following there is described an example of the method for target tracking, and apparatus for carrying out the method, where the calculations for said tracking are done digitally. The appended figures are referred to in the description, where Figure 1 is a time diagram over the tracking sequence and Figure 2 is a principle diagram of the apparatus circuitry.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTThe description primarily refers to tracking a moving target on the PPI of a radar installation. A tracking mark on the indicator, which is to be placed over the target and accompany it, is movable along theX and Y axes. Controlling the mark is done in the same way in both directions, and it is therefore sufficient solely to describe controlling along the X axis hereinafter.The principle for correcting the movement of the controlled tracking mark is apparent from the time diagram in Figure 1. At time zero the tracking mark and the tracked target coincide. The target moves with the velocity v, but the mark is set for a deviating velocity vl. After a time T the aimer carries out a positional correction, here called the distance increment A X, to cause the tracking mark to coincide with the target. For the tracking mark to accompany the target after correction, the set velocity of the tracking mark shall also be changed from v1 to v, simultaneously as the tracking mark is given the distance increment A X. The quotient between the distance increment and velocity change will be precisely T, which is the time from one instant when the mark coincided with the target to the point of time where a new correction is made.Experience from previously executed apparatus for target tracking shows that when the target is a fast airplane at a short distance from the sighting means, the time between corrections is of the order of magnitude 0,5 seconds, whereas when target tracking is done on a radar indicator, the time between corrections can vary within the region of 1 30 seconds depending on the indicator distance range, target speed etc.In the described example, the radar installation used as an aid for tracking is provided with computing means for the movements along the X and Y axes, the computing means for the movements along theX axis being shown in Figure 2. During the process of target tracking, a correction in the form of a distance increment AX is introduced with the help of a joystick. The correction signal is introduced into the calculation on depressing a press button 1 controlling reversing contacts 1a, b, c. The contacts are actually controlled by relays not shown . In the computing means there are two delaying and addition units 2 and 3, denoted as computing units hereinafter, for the sake of simplicity.The time lag elements in these have a time lag At in the order of magnitude of 0,03 seconds, which is synonymous with the calculations in the computer portion being repeated with a time interval equal to said time lag. A fed in numerical value is added at each calculating occasion, e.g. at A to the latest available delayed numerical value. Both said computing units 2 and 3 are thus integrators.The time T which passes from the latest button push is fed into a time counter 4 which is adapted for zeroing by the contact la at the push button 1, and a signal aT is sent where a is a scale factor.A dividing means 5 is adapted to divide the value of the distance increment AX by aT from the time counter 4 when the push button is depressed.The distance increment A X fed in is also taken to an adder 6 for adding to the numerical value at the output of the first computing unit 2.When the push button is released, the input value A Xis fed via the contact 1c to a second adder 7 to be added to the numerical value at F on the output of the second computing unit 3.When the push button 1 is released and both contacts la and 1b are thus open, the calculation values at B and C in the Figure are zero.A numerical value Xk 1 at D, representing the speed of the tracking mark is fed back to the input of the time lag circuit in the first computing unit 2, after adding the value on the input side at C. Since the value on the input side is zero, the numerical value applied to the computing unit 2 is not altered, and it can therefore be regarded as a register storing the value of the already calculated tracking mark velocity.The same value as at D occurs at A in the figure, since the numerical value at B is zero.The output value Xk 1 in the time delay circuit in the second computing unit 3, which represents the position of the guiding mark, is fed back to the input of the time delay circuit and added there to the numerical value at A, which signifies the speed of the tracking mark. A value signifying the position of the tracking mark is altered every time the addition is carried out by an amount responsive to the set speed the numerical value at the time lag circuit input and the output of the computor circuit 3 at F is therefore changed at a constant rate.The computing means functions such that if the linearly variable signal at F does not lead the tracking mark straight over the target, corrections in the form of additional signals A X at E, which give the distance increment to the tracking mark movement, are added in the second adder 7 to the output signal. When the distance increment has been set to the right value, i.e. the tracking mark has been superposed on the target, the switch 1 is reversed , resulting in the reversal of its contacts. When the contacts reverse, the signal at E will be zero. The same signal now occurs instead at 8, due to the closure of contact Ib. After passing the adding point 6 and the computing unit, it gives an increment to the signal at F, so that the output signalX AX will be unchanged when the button is depressed. he increment at B only exists during one calculation interval and is thereafter put equal to zero it thus being achieved that the signal at F is only given a jump increment.The time has been measured from the nearest preceding button depression in the time counter 4 the measured value of the time T is fed out when the contact la is reversed, and the time counter is zeroed for a new time count. The input value AX is divided by aT in the computing unit 5 so that the signal at C is given the value A X aT.This value of the signal at C is added to the value of the velocity circulating in the computing unit 2, to give a new value of the velocity. The addition is only carried out during one calculation interval, the signal at C subsequently being set to zero the value of the velocity is thereby altered in jumps but stays at the new value.The new value of the velocity also occurs at D and at A.The new value of the velocity at A is added in the computing unit 3 for each calculating interval AT to a new output value at F. The output values X AX will thus be added by a small increment for each calculation interval At, the magnitude of the increment being determined by the signal at A, but since the calculating interval At is very short, the tracking mark controlled by the output signal will appear to move at a constant rate.Tracking is continued with the set velocity until the tracking mark appears to deviate from the target, which can be due to the speed of the tracking mark not having been correctly set or that the velocity of the target along the X axis having been altered. To begin with, the correction is introduced only as a distance increment to the adder 7 without depressing the push button 1, and when the deviation becomes such that the joystick movement becomes considerable, the push button 1 is depressed causing a new velocity correction to be calculated and carried out in the mode just described. The scale factor a incorporated in the division in the computing unit 5 should be set at 1, due to what has previously been said concerning the relationship between the distance increment and change in velocity.To achieve the best filtration of disturbances, and so that capturing the target will be facilitated, it is however suitable to select a greater scale factor than 1.The calculation signals are all numerical values in what has been described hereinbefore, but the same apparatus can be made with the calculation values being represented by analogue electrical voltages or currents.Apart from radar, the described method and the described apparatus are secondarily to be considered with respect to a sighting means where the presentation means is an optical telescope and the driving means are motors for adjusting the direction of the telescope.
