## Description
1 w AMINOALKOXY 3,3 , 5 TRIMETHYLCYCLOHEXANES , PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICALCOMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SAME. The invention relates to novel l co aminoalkoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexanes and their salts, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing same. 1 aminoalkoxy 3,3, 5 trimethylcyclohexanes, which possess an additional unsubstituted phenylresidue in the l position, are known from WestGerman Patent Specification 1 229 521. These known compounds are described to have a blood pressure increasing effect. It is an object of the invention to provide novel active substances, which promote blood circulation without having marked hypertensive properties. It is a further and more general object of the present invention to provide novel substances which are useful in the prophylaxis and or treatment of cardiovascular disorders. e.g. angina pectoris, arrhythmia . Surprisingly, l caaminoalkoxy 3,3, 5 trimethyl cyclohexanes of the general formula EMI2.1 and their salts with physiologically acceptable acids, whereR1 denotes a straight chain or branched alkyl, or an aryl or aralkyl residue, which may be substituted by alkyl residues or halogen atoms R2 and R3 denote a straight chain or branched alkyl residue and n represents 2 3 or 4, were found to increase coronary and peripheral blood flow and improve the refractory period, in combination with a positively inotropic effect on heart muscle and a moderate lowering of blood pressure. This biological profile of the present compounds is based on test results obtained in in vivo experiments anaesthetized dogs as well as in bin vitro experiments with isolated heart or atrium of guinea pigs . In view of the very close structural similarity of the compounds according to the invention and those known from the German Specification 1 229 521, this biological profile, that is completely different from the said known compounds, is the more surprising. The compounds of formula I are prepared by methods in actual use or described in the literature.A very convenient method consists of the reaction of a compound of the formula EMI3.1 with the compoundEMI3.2 or an acid addition salt thereof, in whichR1, R2, R3 and.n have the meanings indicated before and X and Y are hydroxy or halogen provided that where X is hydroxy, Y is halogen and where X is halogen, Y is hydroxy.For example, one method is illustrated by the following reaction sequence EMI3.3 Step 1 For example, the Grignard compound is prepared from the appropriate halogen derivative and magnesium in anhydrous ether and it is reacted with the trimethylated cyclohexanone in anhydrous ether at about 50 C. The complex formed is decomposed with ammonium chloride and the desired compound is obtained from the organic phase.Step 2 For example, a suspension of finely pulverised sodium amide in anhydrous benzene is added, with vigorous stirring, to the trimethylated cyclohexan l ol, substituted in the l position, in anhydrous benzene. The mixture is then heated under reflux.Step 3 For example, a solution of the alkylamino alkyl halide in anhydrous benzene is added to the reaction mixture of Step 2 and the whole is heated under reflux. The compound according to the invention is obtained from the reaction residue. The compounds can also be prepared by halogenating the cyclohexan l ol, substituted in the l position, by known methods and reacting the haloderivative of the general formula EMI4.1 with an amino alcohol of the general formula EMI4.2 to form the compounds according to the invention. For the preparation of the acid addition salts, the free bases according to the invention are usually reacted with the acid desired in the usual way. The compounds of the invention comprise racemates and optically active isomers as well.The latter compounds can be separated from the racemate I in the usual manner. It is also possible, however, to prepare directly the optically active isomers I by using optically active starting material in the preparation methods described before.Examples of suitable acid addition salts according to the invention are hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, nitrates, sulphates and phosphates as well as salts with organic acids such as tartaric acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid. Hydrogen fumarates are especially preferred. The compounds according to the invention can be processed to customary liquid pr solid pharmaceutical preparations, for example, to sugarcoated pills, tablets, suppositories and solutions, also for injection. The customary excipients and diluents are used for this purpose. The oral single dose ranges from 1 to 60 mg kg pf body weight, the oral daily dose ranges from 3 to 180 mg kg of body weight. The parenteral single dose ranges from 0.1 to 15 mg kg of body weight and the parenteral daily dose is the threefold quantity of this single dose. The residue R1 of the compounds according to the general formula I is preferably alkyl 1 6 C , such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec. butyl, tert. butyl, isobutyl, methylbutyl and n pentyl, or aryl or aryl 1 4 C alkyl, such as phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, phenylpropyl, naphthyl and naphthylmethyl. Preferred R1 residues are isobutyl, phenyl and benzyl. The aryl residues, particularly the phenyl residue, may be substituted by one or more halogen, viz. chlorine, bromine, iodine and especially fluorine, or by alkyl 1 4 C , especially methyl or ethyl. The para position is the preferred position of the substituent. Examples of the residues R2 and R3 are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and hexyl.R2 and R3 can be either different or identical residues. Preferably, R2 and R3 are both methyl or both ethyl. The value of n is preferably 2 or 3. From a view point of improved blood flow properties, in combination with a positively inotropic effect the following compounds are preferred 1 2 phenylethyl 1 3 diethylaminopropoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane and l benzyl l 3 diethylamlnopropoxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane as well as acid addition salts thereof. These compounds can eminently be used as coronary and peripheral vasodilators. From a view point of an improved refractory period of the heart in combination with a positively inotropic effect the following compounds are preferred l 3 methylbutyl l 2 dimethylaminoethoxy 3,3, 5 trimethylcyclohexane and l p fluorobenzyl l 2 dimethylamino ethoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyc lohexane, as well as acid addition salts thereof. These compounds may preferably be used in the treatment of arrhythmia. Example 1Preparation of 1 2 phenylethyl 1 3 diethylamino Propoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane hydrogen fumarate. a 0.1 molecule of 1 2 phenylethyl l hydroxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane is dissolved in 30 ml of anhydrous benzene and added dropwise, with vigorous stirring, to.a suspension of 0.1 molecule of finely pulverised sodium amide in 30 ml of anhydrous benzene during 30 minutes. The reaction mixture then is heated under reflux for 2 hours, cooled to 35 40 OC and a solution of 0.11 molecule of diethylaminopropyl l chloride in 20 ml of anhydrous benzene is added. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for a further 6 hours, cooled and washed 3 times with 50 ml of water. The organic phase is boiled down and the oily residue fractionated in vacuo. l 2 phenylethyl l t3 diethylamino n propoxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane is obtained. 20 Yield 82X n20 1.4968 b.p. 156 158 C O.1 torr. b 0.1 molecule of l 2 phenylethyl 1 3 diet hyl amino n propoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane is dissolved in 50 ml of ethyl alcohol and added to 0.1 molecule of fumaric acid, dissolved in 50 ml of hot ethyl alcohol.
