# Drawing board.

## Abstract
A drawing board suitable for use in preparing perspec tive drawings is provided with a pair of arcuate guide sur faces 14, 15 facing towards one another and situated towards one side of the drawing board, with a recess or depression 31 between the arcuate guide surfaces 14, 15 , so that a drawing instrument not shown having projections capable of engaging the arcuate guide surfaces, can be readily moved from one arcuate guide surface to the other to enable the drawing instrument to point towards vanishing points VP1, VP2 on either side of the drawing board. The drawing board may have straight guide edges 36, 37, 38 , as well as additional arcuate guide edges 40, 41, 42 , one of which 40 may be directed towards a central vanishing point VP3 . The multi purpose board can be used to produce various types of perspective drawings and seven vanishing points VP1 to VP7 are shown.
