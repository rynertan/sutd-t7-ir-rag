## Description
DESCRIP2IOIf Apparatus for leading a partial fluid flow from a conduit.Technical Field The present invention relates to an apparatus for deflecting a partial fluid flow from a conduit to an area where measurements are made on the fluid.Background Art Vilien measuring the purity of washing or rinsing water, pumped through piping in dairies for removing milk residue and the like, attempts have been made to use a turbidity meter which has either been inserted in the conduit or in a branch pipe provided with a cooler and leading to the conduit and to waste.Since the rinsing water has high temperature, the direct contact between it and the meter, when the latter is inserted in the conduit, results in that it becomes spoilt or that its function is deteriorated, this solution thus not being utilizable. In the case where a branch pipe with cooler is used, the meter being.destroyed is indeed avoided, but material and installation costs will be high, at the same time as the heat content of the water discharged to the waste will be lost.Disclosure of the Invention The object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus by means of which the above mentioned disadvantages have been circumvented. This object is attained by the invention having been given the characterizing features disclosed in the claims. The foremost advantages of the apparatus in accordance with the invention is that it is easy and cheap to manufacture, it is simple to fit to a pipe, and movable from one test point to another, it gives small flow resistance, and does not cause any measurement lag, the turbidity of a liquid can be measured without the measuring apparatus being subjected to the effect of heat, coolers or similar auxiliary equipment do.not need to be used, and the liquid on which measurement is carried out is immediately returned to the pipe after measurement. Brief deeeription of drawings Figure 1 is a side view of a conduit with the apparatus in accordance with the invention fitted to it, Figure 2 is a section along the line II II in Bigure 1 and Figure 3 is a view seen from above of the conduit illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention A part of a conduit, e.g. for conveying milk in a dairy, is denoted on the figures by the numeral 1. In order to carry out measurements such as those for turbidity, redox, pH or conductivity of the milk or of a fluid which is passed through the conduit to clean it, an apparatus in accordance with the invention has been fitted to the conduit. The apparatus has the form of a parallelepipedic box 2 with an upwardly open side, the edges of which engage sealingly against the cylindrical surface of the conduit 1 via rectangular, closed, sealing ring 3. The box 2 is fitted to the underside of the conduit 7t but if so desired it can be fitted to one side thereof instead.However, to prevent air bubbles forming in the box, the greater part of it should be situated under the longitudinal axis of conduit 1.The box 2 is removably attached to the conduit 1 by means of hose clips 4 and 5. As will be seen from Figures 1 and 3, there are two holes 6, 7 in the conduit at mutual spacing along its longitudss1 direction. Parallel to the longitudinal axis of the conduit 1 each hole has been provided with two slits 8, 9 and 10, 11, respectively, each pair of slits defining a tongue 12 and 13, respectively, which is bent in towards the centre of the conduit 1. The box 2 is fitted to the conduit such that the holes 6, 7 and tongues 12, 13 come within the walls of the box in the vicinity of its end walls 2a and 2b, as shown in Figure 1. A continuously curved plate 14 is fixed inside the box 2, to form a wall for a through flow channel 15, the remaining walls of which are formed by the cylindrical surface of the conduit between the tongues 11, 13 and portions of the opposing side walls of the box parallel to the conduit. By reason of the continuously curved wall 14 and both tongues 12, 13 there is obtained a substantially laminar flow of the fluid led through the channel 15, the tongue 12 leading fluid to the channel inlet, if the fluid is fed from left to right in Figure 1, with the tongue 13 contributing to provide an advantageous flow pattern at the channel outlet. If the fluid is fed from right to left in Figure 1, the tongue 13 leads the fluid into the channel 15, while the tongue 12 advantageously affects the flow pattern at the channel outlet. Sight glasses 16 and 17 are sealingly inserted in holes opposite each other in the side walls of the box, which are parallel to the conduit. A turbidity meter of known type, e.g.one sold under the name of EurbidimeterS type ATE 20, byCerlic Electronics AB, Solna, Sweden, can be used for measuring the turbidity of the fluid flowing through the channel 15. Such a meter includes a U shaped measuring part Ms schematically illustrated in Pigure 2, which is mounted over the box 2 SQ that its light emitting and receiving means ml and m2 come in the centre of the sight glasses 16 and 17. A meter Es e.g. a pH, redox or conductivity meter, with an electrode eS thrusting into the channel 15, is attached to the bottom of the box 2 and is schematically illustrated in Pigure 2. If so desired, several meters of the kind mentioned or.of some other kind can naturally be removably or permanently mounted on the box 2, for carrying out measurements on the fluid flowing through the channel 15. Although only one embodiment of the invention has been described above and illustrated on the drawing, it will be understood that modifications of this embodiment as well as other embodiments are possible without departing from the inventive concept. The invention is thus only restricted by what is disclosed in the claims.
