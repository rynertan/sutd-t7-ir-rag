## Description
The invention relates to a quaternary solid state electrolyte based on a vitreous lithium cation conductor of the composition aX, bLi₂S, Y, Z where X is selected from the group consisting of P₂S₅ and SiS₂ a is from about 0.5 to about 2 b is from 0.25 to 2 Y is an oxygen containing lithium compound selected from the group consisting of Li₂CO₃.

Ionic conductivity is usually associated with the flow of ions through a liquid solution of salts. In the vast majority of practical uses of ionic conductors, i.e., as electrolytes for dry cell batteries, the liquid solution is immobilized in the form of a paste or gelled matrix or is absorbed in a separator to overcome the difficulties associated with handling and packaging a liquid. However, even after immobilization, the system is still subject to possible leakage, has a limited shelf life due to drying out or crystallization of the salts and is suitable for use only within a limited temperature range corresponding to the liquid range of the electrolyte. In addition, the use of a large volume of immobilizing material has hindered the aims of miniaturization. In addition, improved microelectronic circuit designs have generally decreased the current requirements for electronic devices. This in turn has enhanced the applicability of solid electrolyte power sources which usually can deliver currents only in the microampere range. These solid electrolyte systems have the inherent advantages of being free of electrolyte leakage and internal gassing problems due to the absence of a liquid phase. In addition, they also have a much longer shelf life than the conventional liquid electrolyte power sources. In attempting to avoid the shortcomings of liquid systems, investigators have surveyed a large number of solid compounds seeking to find compounds which are solid at room temperature and have specific conductances approaching those exhibited by the commonly used liquid systems. Solid electrolytes must be essentially electronic insulators so as not to internally short the cell while at the same time they must allow ionic migration in the crystal lattice for the cell to operate. It has been discovered that certain metallic salts which are solids at room temperature have specific conductances sufficiently high to permit their use in practical battery applications. For example, US A 3,723,185 discloses solid state electrolytes of compounds conforming to the general formula AgI MCN AgCN or modifications thereof where M is potassium, rubidium, cesium or mixtures thereof.

US A 4,465,746 discloses a solid state electrolyte based on vitreous lithium cation conductor of the composition SiS₂, xLi₂S, yLiI where x is from 0.8 to 1.5. y is from 0 to about 2, and wherein said composition has a conductivity of at least 0.75 x 10 ⁴ohm ¹cm ¹ at 25 C. US A 4,513,070 discloses an electrochemical device which uses a vitreous material having a general formula xA It is an object of the present invention to provide a new class of quaternary vitreous compositions that can be used as solid electrolytes in solid state cell systems. Another object of the invention is to provide a SiS₂ based or P₂S₅ based vitreous lithium cation conductor which contains a lithium oxide compound and which has a conductivity of at least 0.75 x 10 ⁴ohm ¹cm ¹ at 25 C. The foregoing and additional objects will become more fully apparent from the following description. The invention relates to a quaternary solid electrolyte having a vitreous lithium cation conductor of the composition aX, bLi₂S, Y, Z where X is selected from the group consisting of P₂S₅ and SiS₂ a is from about 0.5 to about 2 b is from 0.25 to 2 Y is an oxygen containing lithium compound selected from the group consisting of Li₂CO₃, Li₂SiO₃ and Li₄SiO₄ Z is a dopant selected from the group consisting of LiI, LiBr, LiCl and LiF and wherein said composition has a conductivity of at least 0.75 x 10 ⁴ohm ¹cm ¹ at 25 C. In the above quaternary composition b is preferably between about 1 and about 2. As used herein, vitreous shall mean a composition in a glassy non crystalline state and shall also include materials that have been cooled so rapidly from the molten condition that crystal formation is prevented. When X is SiS₂, then the vitreous composition of SiS₂ and Li₂S or Li₂SiS₃ can be prepared at 1 atmosphere pressure by first mixing silicon disulfide SiS₂ and lithium sulfide Li₂S in 1 1 mole ratio in an inert gas filled dry box. The mixture is then placed in a vitreous carbon crucible which in turn is placed in an inert gas reaction chamber. The SiS₂ and Li₂S mixture is heated at an elevated temperature for a time period sufficient for the SiS₂ to react with the Li₂S to form Li₂SiS₃. Generally, the SiS₂ and Li₂S mixture can be heated at about 950 C for about 6 hours. The Li₂SiS₃ is then quenched to ambient temperature about 20 C to form the vitreous solid. If desired, the lithium compound can be added by grinding together the vitreous Li₂SiS₃ and the lithium compound, placing the mixture in a vitreous carbon crucible and then heating the mixture at an elevated temperature for a time period sufficient to form a solution of the lithium compound in the Li₂SiS₃ material. The material is then quenched to room temperature. Generally the mixture can be heated at about 950 C for about 6 hours and then quenched to room temperature. Using the above technique, Li₂S and SiS₂ can be fused with Li₂CO₃, Li₂SiO₃ or Li₄SiO₄ and a dopant such as LiI, LiBr, LiCl or LiF to produce vitreous compositions all having conductivity in excess of 10 ⁴ohm ¹cm ¹. The addition of Li₂CO₃ and a dopant to Li₂SiS₃ and then fusing the materials resulted in a red brown glass with excellent conductivity. Additionally, Li₂CO₃ assists in formation of a vitreous product since fusion of Li₂S SiS₂ at 950 C followed by a cold water quench to 20 C often results in a crystalline and or opaque material, whereas fusion and quenching of material containing Li₂CO₃ results in a clear reddish brown glass. Indeed, even slow cooling the fused materials containing Li₂CO₃ results in a clear reddish brown glass. Thus lithium carbonate significantly and unexpectedly aids in forming and maintaining the vitreous state such that the need to rapidly quench the melt is lessened. Lithium metasilicate, Li₂SiO₃, also forms a highly cationically conductive glass with Li₂SiS₃. P₂S₅ based vitreous compositions can be prepared by melting together the components P₂S₅, Li₂S, a dopant and the lithium compound at a temperature which lies between 700 C and 950 C, followed by tempering and then by annealing at a temperature of about 100 C. If desired, the P₂S₅ and Li₂S components can be first heated and then the lithium compound and dopant can be added. However, the synthesis of P₂S₅ based materials must be performed in sealed vessels due to the volatility of P₂S₅. The lithium compounds for use in the invention are Li₂Co₃, Li₂SiO₃, and Li₄SiO₄. These lithium compounds Li₂CO₃, Li₂SiO₃ and Li₄SiO₄ are believed to be network formers and not dopants while LiI, LiF, LiBr and LiCl are the dopants. Network former is a compound which provides a macromolecular network of irregular structure whereby the anion of the network former, i.e., O , S , etc., forms bridges between the cations of the network former resulting in the formation of an extended network. Network modifier is an ionic compound added to a network former which introduces covalency into the macromolecular network by incorporating its anion into the macromolecular network by cleavage of some of the bridges between the network former cation and the associated network former anion and bonding the modifier anion to the network former cation. Network dopant is a compound added to a network former or the network former plus network modifier which provides additional mobile cations but whose associated anion does Anode materials suitable for use with the solid electrolyte of this invention include lithium, silver, sodium, potassium, and rubidium. The preferred anode materials are lithium and lithium alloys. Cathodes suitable for use with the solid electrolyte of this invention include poly N vinylpyrrolidone PVP iodine, PVP iodine TiS₂, FeS₂, Sb₂S₃, TiS₂, MoS₃, TiS₂ MoS₃, organic charge transfer complexes with halogens, and MnO₂. Vitreous Li₂SiS₃ was prepared by mixing 30 grams SiS₂ and 15 grams Li₂S in 1 1 mole ratio in a helium filled dry box. The mixture was placed in a vitreous carbon cruicible which in turn was placed in a vitreous silica reaction tube. The tube was closed and was equipped with a conventional exhaust vent and a small conventional intake feed tube adapted for feeding helium into the reaction tube. The SiS₂ and Li₂S mixture, under a 1 atmosphere pressure of helium, was heated at 950 C for 6 hours and then the reaction tube was quenched to room temperature 20 C by submerging the reaction tube in cold water. The vitreous Li₂SiS₃ solid electrolyte produced was then ground. The vitreous Li₂SiS₃ produced was combined with Li₂CO₃ and LiBr or LiI. The mixture was ground, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and then placed in a reaction tube. Under 1 atmosphere helium pressure, the Li₂SiS₃, Li₂CO₃ and LiI or LiBr mixtures were each heated at 950 C for 6 hours and then the reaction tube was quenched to room temperature 20 C by submerging the reaction tube in cold water. The quaternary vitreous solid electrolytes produced were ground, pelletized and found to have a conductivity as shown in Table 1. Specifically the conductivity was measured by pelletizing via the application of uniaxial pressure the powdered material between titanium disulfide electrodes at 13,000 psi in a conventional steel mold with steel rams. The disc of solid electrolyte with TiS₂ electrodes was ejected from the mold and then heat sealed in a polyethylene bag. The sample sealed in the bag was then placed in a alcohol filled polytetrafluoroethylene cylinder with a tight fitting lid which was in turn placed in a large steel mold fitted with steel rams. The alcohol filled polytetrafluoroethylene cylinder containing the sample was then compressed to 54,000 psi which results in an isostatic compression of the glass sample disc and its associated electrodes. The TiS₂ solid electrolyte Tis₂ sample was placed in a spring loaded holder fitted with gold contacts. The conductivity of the sample was measured using the complex plane technique first applied to solid electrolytes by J. E. Bauerle, J. Phys. Chem. Solids, A 0.787 inch diameter by 0.063 inch high coin cell was constructed as follows. A cathode composed of TiS₂ containing some solid electrolyte of 0.25LiI 0.375Li₂CO₃ Li₂SiS₃ and powdered aluminum as a conductivity aid was employed. The TiS₂ cathode along with a separate layer of 0.25LiI .0.375 Li₂CO₃ Li₂SiS₃ electrolyte as prepared in Example 1 and a lithium anode were isostatically compressed at 80,000 psi as described in U.S Patent No 4,477,545 and then assembled into the cell housing. The cell was continuously discharged at ambient temperature across a 30 Kohm load to a 1.4 volt cutoff. The voltage readings observed with time are shown in Table 2. It should be understood that the foregoing disclosure relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and it is intended to cover all changes and modifications of the invention which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
