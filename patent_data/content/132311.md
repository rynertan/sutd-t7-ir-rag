# Plating bath composition for copper tin zinc alloy.

## Abstract
An alkaline, cyanide, aqueous electroplating com position of copper, tin, and zinc includes a small amount of nickel to enhance the inclusion of tin in the copper tin zinc plate deposited from the solution. The plate resists tarnish ing by a corrosion test solution, and retains its bright silvery colored appearance because the plate preferably includes at least about 10.9 atomic wt tin. The plating method for enhanced tin alloys through nickel additions to the bath is also described.
