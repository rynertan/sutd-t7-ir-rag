## Description
MOTOR VEHICLE FASCIA ASSEMBLIES This invention relates to motor vehicle fascia assemblies. A known form of motor vehicle fascia assembly has a fascia for extending across the vehicle body formed with a shallow recess in an upper surface thereof and an instrument holding binnacle is mountable on the fascia in the shallow recess on either side of the mid position along the fascia according to whether the fascia is for a left or right hand drive version of th e vehicle. With this arrangement it is only possible to provide a relatively shallow instrument binnacle which must therefore be relatively long in order to accommodate all the instruments and controls required or the binnacle either projects too far into the sight line of the driver or the fascia has to be mounted too low down. Also the instrument binnacle does not appear to form part of an integral whole with the fascia. This .invention provides a motor vehicle fascia assembly comprising a fascia having a pair of binnacle receiving positions disposed one on either side of a mid position along the fascia and an instrument binnacle to be received in one or other of the binnacle receiving positions for either left or right hand drive versions of the vehicle, wherein the binnacle receiving positions are formed by a pair of similar generally rearwardly facing recesses extending into the rearward side of the fascia, the instrument binnacle being shaped to engage in one or other of the recesses as appropriate for a left or right hand drive version of the vehicle Thus, an instrument binnacle can be used which is deeper and shorter than that in the known assembly without the binnacle projecting too far into the sight line of the driver, and the binnacle may be mounted on the steering column or column support if desired. Also, a deep storage compartment may be provided in the recess which is not occupied by the instrument binnacle. The following is a description of some embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective part exploded view of one embodiment of the invention and Figure 2 is a sectional view of part of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 along the line 2 2. A vehicle fascia panel a.s.sebly 10 comprises a plastics moulding 11 extending transversely of the vehicle. The panel 11 formed sach that it is symmetrical about the centre line A A as shown in Figure 1. A rectangular recess 12 is formed in the panel 11 either side of the centre line A A to provide rearwardly extending end portions 13, 14 and a central portion 15, the rear faces of which are apertured to receive various control elements or accesxsories. A controllable air vent 16 for the passage of warm or cold air is provided on the upper part of each end portion 13, 14 whilst a retractable ashtray 17 is located on the lower part of each end portion below the vent 16. A further larger controllable air vent 18 is located on the upper part of the rear face of the central portion 15Of the fascia panel 11 whilst control levers 19,20 for controlling the distribution and temperature of the he ting venti1ating air from the vents are located for transverse horizontal movement in a slotted guide plate mounted on the lower part of the rear face of the central portion 15 below vent 18. Provision may be made for a ra4to 21 on the underside of the central portion 15 of the fascia RTI ID 3.18 a shown in chain dotted line in Figure 1. A further moulded plastics panel 22 isgsecured to the isn.sIde surfaces of the fascia panel 11. by suitable welding or adhesive to provide, with the inside surfaces of the fascia panel, ducting for the passage of warm or cold ar from a suitable source on the vehicle, through communicating apertures 23, 24, 25 in panel 22 to vent 16, windscreen demisting vents 26, and or vent 18 in panel 11.Two upstanding spaced apart walls 27 are formed in panel 22 to separate apertures 23, 24, 25 and to provide Xndi.vidual ducts communicating with each of the vents 16 and 26 and a further duct communicating with vent 18, the passage and or temperature of the air passing through the ducts being controlled by valve means not shown controlled by the operation of levers 19, 20 on the fascia.Thus warm or cold air can be selectively directed to either the vents 16 and demister ducts 26 or to vent 18 or all.Referring to Figure 1, a steering wheel 28 is mounted on the end of a steering column not shown which is attached to a suitable support b racket also not shown secured to the vehicle body panel structure. An instrument binnacle 29 is secured at its base to the steering column support bC7cke t such that th e binnacle is located wi,, thin recesss 12 on that side ot the fascia panel 11 with, the connections to the various instruments not shown passing through the aperture 30 in the recess 12.The other recess on the opposite side of the fascia panel is engaged by a suitably shaped storage container 31 releasably attachable to the fascia panel 11. In Figure 1, the container is shown removed from the recess in the fascia and can be attached thereto by a pair of heade4 pins 32 protruding forwardly from the container front wall and engaging into keyhole slots 33 in the transversely extending wall of the recess 12. This method of attachment is by way of example only and other suitable methods may be adopted.if desired. Similarly, the container 31 as illustrated in Figure 1 is of simple basic form and can be replaced by other forms of containers with or without hinged or removable covers and suitable for a particular specialised function such as for example, a tool kit, liquid container storage, refreshment storage, first aid kit etc. etc.Means for securing the fascia panel to the vehicle structure are not shown but xay comprise any suitable arrangement to suit a particular vehicle construction.Where it may be required, or it is not possible satisfactorily to mount the instrument binnacle directly on to the steering column support, as for example may be the case with rake or axially adjustable steering columns, the binnacle may be mounted on another part of the vehicle, for example, the binnacle may be mounted on a support bracket or brackets secured to the vehicle structure and separate from the steering column, or alternatively, by a combination of the fascia and a suitable support bracket or brackets also not associated with the steering column support. From the foregoing therefore it can be seen that the invention provides not only a fascia panel which is not affected by whether the vehicle is right hand or left hand drive but also provides a greater degree of flexibility regarding the provision of suitable storage facilities which can be altered to suit a particular requirement.
