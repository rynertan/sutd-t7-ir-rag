# Range finding apparatus using encoded signals.

## Abstract
Range finding apparatus uses encoded binary signals for modulating the transmitted signal. A random sequence generator 13 generates a random sequence of binary signals, and these signals are written into a cyclic sequence of addresses in a memory 27 under the control of a fixed frequency clock 11 . Signals are read out from the memory under the control of a variable frequency clock incorporating a code locked loop 26 which compares the signals read from the memory with signals derived from the reflected ranging signal. Range determining logic means 35, 37, 38 measures the interval between writing into and reading from a predetermined address location in the memory 27 , and thereby provides a measure of the range. The memory 27 includes a variable delay, which may comprise a shift register clocked by the code locked loop 26 , to synchronise the signals derived from the reflected ranging signal 23 with those read from the memory 27 .
