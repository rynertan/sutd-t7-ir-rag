The signals received, although they are read intermittently or continuously, are stored for period of one second in the main memory 1. Each minute, the maximum, minimum or mean values are registered, depending on the magnitude to be measured, which are then captured onto the cassette type 4 in the format suitable for its subsequent processing outside the system.The data captured in the capture module 4 make it possible to have knowledge of the information necessary to determine the operating conditions of the machine in the period of time established, hours, days, weeks, with an indication of its operators, idle and operating times, speeds, accelerations, pressures, temperatures and various accidents, these being reflected, if it is deemed convenient, in the graphical display module 6.
