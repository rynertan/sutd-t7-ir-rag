## Description
The present invention relates to a macrophage activating composition containing a water soluble β 1.3 bound D glucan and a water insoluble carrier on which said glucan is immobilized. A water soluble glucan immobilized in this manner has in connection with the invention been found to possess capability of acitvating mononuclear phagocytes, so called macrophages. It is known that certain polysaccharides improve the defence mechanism of the body, i.a. through activation of the complement system and stimulation of the function of monocytes macrophages. These cells are of a central importance to the defence of the body, both from the inside and from the outside, for example against the growth of cancer cells or the attack of for example bacteria. It has been previously shown GLYCAN STIMULATION OF MACROPHAGES IN VITRO, R. Seljelid, G. Bögwald and Å.Lundwall, Experimental Cell Research 139 1981 121 , that certain and necessarily non soluble glucans, particularly such containing 1.3 bound β D glucose entitities, activate macrophages Since unsoluble compounds often are unsuitable to use Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of such composition. In accordance with the present invention it has been surprisingly found that water soluble β 1.3 bound D glucans which normally do not activate macrophages by immobilization to a water insoluble carrier obtain macrophage stimulating properties. Soluble, per se inactive β 1.3 bound D glucans thus activate macrophages after immobilization to suitable surfaces. Such surfaces find broad utility in medicinal technology. As examples there may be mentioned different forms of extracorporeal circulation, where blood is passed over surfaces coated with β 1.3 bound D glucans. Other medicinal applications are presented in the following in the exemplifying part of the disclosure. As examples of β 1.3 bound D glucans useful in the present invention there may be mentioned laminaran, curdlan, pachyman, yeast glucan and lichenan. By the expression macrophage as used in the present disclosure is meant mononuclear phagocytes which is a more adequate expression from a scientific point of view. The tehnique according to the present invention may thus primarily be used for activating mononuclear phagocytes of animals including man. This means that the composition according to the present invention can be used for improving the body defence of animals, for example against infections and cancer, particularly humans and commercially useful animals. Such conceivable areas of use are verified by the experimental tests which are presented in the following in the present disclosure. The immobilization of the glucan is preferably provided by covalent coupling to a suitable carrier. Particularly preferred is the use of carriers containing amino groups to which the glucan is coupled. The preferred technique thus means that the surface of the carrier is first activated by introduction of amino groups. The glucan is modified in such a manner as to be covalently bindable to the aminated surface. The character of the carrier is not critical and the use of different types of plastics is conceivable as well as the use of aminated gels. The technique for covalent coupling of a glucan to a surface while using binding to amine groups is, as previously indicated, a preferred technique for immobilization. As example a β 1.3 bound D glucan is degraded in a suitable acid, preferably a strong acid, for example formic acid, and is then treated with 2 chloracetaldehydodimethylacetal for substitution with O 2.2 dimethoxyethyl groups. Such substituted glucan is then treated with acid to form aldehyde groups, the aldehyde substituted glucan being then brought into contact with a carrier containing amino groups in the presence of cyanoborohydride, covalent coupling to the carrier being provided. In another example epoxyfunctions are introduced in a glucan by activation with epichlorohydrin. When the epoxi activated glucan is brought into contact with a carrier containing amino groups these latter react with the epoxy groups, the glucan being covalently bound to the carrier. Details concerning the coupling technique is clear from the following specific examples. Reverting to the application of the invention it has been found that in accordance with the invention immobilized β 1.3 bound D glucans show cytostatic effect and antibacterial effect. The fact that immobilized β 1.3 bound D glucans activate macrophages so that they provide for a cytostatic effect is shown in the present disclosure by the use of tumor cells and macrophages in culture on tissue cultivating plates covered with β 1.3 bound D glucans. The results are presented below in the examples. The fact that immobilized β 1.3 bound macrophages possess antibacterial activity is shown in the disclosure by the fact that β 1.3 bound D glucans coupled to polystyrene spheres prevent peritonitis in mice infected with pneumococci or streptococci. The results in connection hereto are unambiguous in that all test animals in the control group died, whereas all animals treated with glucan coated polystyrene spheres survived. The invention also provides for a macrophage stimulatory composition containing as an active constituent an immobilized glucan according to the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active immobilized glucans according to the present invention can, in a conventional manner, be formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine. The composition or the pharmaceutical preparation can contain the active constituents in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which may be solid, semi solid or liquid depending on the route of administration and other actual conditions. Sometimes it may also be suitable to use a bio degradable carrier. The active constituents may also be used as such without the addition of carrier materials. The compositions are manufactured in full conformity with conventional pharmaceutical practice. As previously indicated the function of the mononuclear phagocytes is of a central importance to the defence of the body both in influence from the inside and from the outside. Through the present invention compositions are made available which have the ability of generally activating the defence system of the body, for example against growth of cancer cells and infections. Such applications are conceivable for vertebrate animals of different kinds , comprising mammals including man and fishes. In order to reduce the tendency for arisal of diseases in for example fish cultivated under controlled conditions the compositions according to the present invention may advantageously be supplied to the fish milieu, either directly in the water where cultivation is carried out or as an additive to the food. The invention is particularly useful in connection with cultivation of noble fish, such as salmon, trout or similar species. The invention will in the following be further described by specific examples.

To this solution there are added aminated plastic spheres 0.2 g having a diameter of 2.4 µm manufactured by copolymerization of 2.3 epoxipropylmethacrylate and ethylenglycoldimethacrylate according to J.Uglestad, P.C.Mörk, K.M.Kaggerud, T.Ellingsen and A.Berge SWELLING OF OLIGOMER POLYMER PARTICLES. NEW METHODS OF PREPARATION OF EMULSIONS AND POLYMER DISPERSIONS. A 1 solution of epoxi activated laminaran prepared as per Example 2 was dissolved in phosphate buffer 0.2 M, pH 7.0 and added to each well of a plate for tissue cultivation modified as per Example 5. The plates were allowed to stand at room temperature over night, were washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature. Sugar analysis showed that 0.005 mg glucan had been bound to each well. The reaction for the coupling is illustrated diagramatically below ¹⁴C labelled D glucoseamine is added to macrophage cultures in wells of tissue cultivation plates with and without immobilized β 1.3 bound D glucan. An increased incorporation of D glucoseamine in glycoproteins in macrophages is an activation parameter for macrophages. After 24 hours the cells are dissolved in 5 trichloroacetic acid and non incorporated radioactive D glucoseamine is washed away. The washed cells are dissolved in sodiumhydroxide 1M . When all cell material has been dissolved the solution is transferred to measuring cuvettes and the radioactivity is measured in a scintillation counter. The degree of activation is expressed by the quotient The best results are obtained from plates activated accordind to Example 6. The results are presented in Fig. 1 which will be explained below. Target cells 2 x 10⁴ cells well were treated with trypsine and added to the macrophages cultures in the presence of glucan covered plastic surfaces according to Examples 6, 7 and 9. After different times there were added 0.5 µCi ml radioactive thymidine methyl ³H, New England Nuclear, Dreieich, West Germany to the cultures. Incorporation was measured after an incubation period of 24 hours. After harvesting the cultures the high molecular material was precipitated with 1M perchloric acid and thouroghly washed before dissolution in 1M sodiumhydroxide solution. The dissolved material was transferred to measuring cells and analyzed in a scintillation counter Packard Instruments, International, Zürich, Switzerland . The best results were obtained from plates modified according to Example 6. The others gave acceptable results. The results are shown in Fig. 2 which is explained below. For investigating the antibacterial effect The experiment was repeated while injecting virulent Streptococcus Viridans and with polymethacrylate spheres treated with β 1.3 bound D glucans, and the animals showed no signs of disease. The experiments have been repeated three times with the same result. The degree of stimulation of macrophages determined by morphology SEM introduction of ¹⁴C glucoseamine and by cytostatic effect on target cells of the type L 929. Macrophages grown on aminated plastic microtiterplate according to Example 5 or plastic with immobilized amylose incorporated somewhat more ¹⁴C glucoseamine than cells grown on untreated plastic. However, a ten fold increase in incorporation of ¹⁴C glucoseamine was obtained when macrophages were grown on surfaces containing immobilized laminaran or curdlan. This fact is clear from appended Fig. 1 showing the introduction of radioactive ¹⁴C glucoseamine in macrophages, cultivated for 48 hours on microtiterplates of modified plastic. In Fig. 1 stimulatory index relates to introduction cpm in stimulated macrophages divided by introduction in normal unstimulated macrophages . In the Fig. column 1 relates to aminated plastic, column 2 relates to plastic with immobilized amylose, whereas columns 3 and 4 relate to plastic with immobilized curdlan and immobilized laminaran, respectively, where coupling of the glucan is carried out according to Example 5. The results in the figure relate to average standard deviation. As is clear from Fig. 1 using the technique of the present invention results in a substantial increase of the stimulation of the macrophages . The cytostatic effect of macrophages was studied by measuring the introduction of radioactive ³H thymidine in L 929 cells with co cultivation. Unstimulated macrophages have a certain cytostatic effect on L 929 cells, and in a typical experiment cultivation of solely L 929 cells incorporated about 55 000 cpm. In the presence of unstimulated macrophages a corresponding cultivation of L 929 cells incorporated about 15 000 cpm. 100 in Fig. 2 L 929 cells in co cultivation with macrophages on aminated plastic incorporated about 50 less of ³H thymidine than L 929 cells in co cultivation using unstipulated macrophages. This is illustrated in appended Fig. 2, wherein the introduction of radioactive thymidine is shown for a number of cultures of L 929 cells with macrophages . Column 1 shows cultivation in plates of unmodified plastic, column 2 shows the corresponding cultivation carried out in plates of aminated plastic, whereas columns 3, 4 and 5 show cultivation performed in plates of plastic with immobilized amylose, curdlan and laminaran, respectively. Application of the technique according to the invention obviously results in a drastically growth inhibiting effect by the stimulation provided by the macrophages .
