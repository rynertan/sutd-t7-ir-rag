## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, particularly a transistor. As transistors which permit high densities of integration on Si substrates, the bipolar transistor and the MOS Metal Oxide Semiconductor type field effect transistor MOSFET have hitherto been typical, in view of the operating principles. While the bipolar transistor is defined as a vertical device which utilizes the physical phenomena of the diffusion and drift of minority carriers, the field effect transistor is a lateral device which utilizes the drive of majority carriers by an electric field. In recent years, on account of the limitations of physical constants inherent in Si, ultraspeed devices employing compound semiconductors, principally, gallium arsenic GaAs have been under development without altering the essential mechanisms of transistor operations. Among these, a hetero bipolar transistor in, for example, Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 49 43583 and a selectively doped heterojunction type field effect transistor in, for example, Japanese Laid open Patent Application 56 94779 have been described as transistors which employ heterojunctions. From the viewpoint of the operating principle, the latter transistor is almost the same as the MOSFET. In such transistors employing compounds, the essential transistor operations do not differ from those of the devices employing Si, so that disadvantages innate in the bipolar transistor and the field effect transistor hereinbelow, termed FET respectively remain unsolved. More specifically, in case of the hetero bipolar transistor, there is the disadvantage that the density of integration cannot be as high as in the FET because an isolation region must be secured. In the case of the bipolar transistor, there is the lower limit of the thickness of a base layer because of a restriction in the operation principle. On the other hand, field effect transistors are well suited for high integration, but a common disadvantage has been the problem that a large current cannot be taken out. Fig. 1 shows an energy band gap structure for explaining the operating principle of a prior art FET of the selectively doped heterojunction type. Similarly, Fig. 2 shows the sectional structure of this FET. Using the molecular beam epitaxy MBE process ordinarily, a GaAs layer 11 which is approximately 1 µm thick and which is not intentionally doped with any impurity usually, when the MBE is applied, the layer becomes a weak p type having an impurity concentration of at most 10¹⁵ cm ³ is grown on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10. Subsequently, an Al Shown in Fig. 1 is the energy band diagram directly under the gate electrode of the semiconductor device. Si atoms introduced by doping are designated at numeral 14, and a depletion layer based on a Schottky contact is designated at numeral 16. Since AlGaAs and GaAs have crystal lattices of the same kind and have very close lattice constants, the number of interfacial levels at a heterojunction interface is thought to be very small. GaAs is greater in the electron affinity than Al The known FET described above causes the two dimensional carriers to flow along the heterojunction interface, and it has accordingly been impossible to derive a great current therefrom. EP A 0084393 discloses a semiconductor device having three semiconductor layers with two of those layers defining a heterojunction. In the device of EP A 0084393, the two layers defining the heterojunction are the gate and drain layers, and the drain electrode is connected to that layer via further semiconductor layers. The present invention seeks to overcome the disadvantages of the known FET of the selectively doped heterojunction type and the hetero bipolar transistor and proposes a new transistor principle characterised in that the two dimensional carriers 15 existing at the heterojunction interface shown in Fig. 1 are taken out to the side of GaAs layer 11, namely, that they are taken out as current in a direction perpendicular to the heterojunction interface, and that the creation and extinction of the two dimensional carriers are controlled by a gate voltage, whereby the magnitude of the current is modulated to execute a transistor operation. According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor device comprising, at least, a three layer structure in which a first semiconductor layer and a second semiconductor layer are arranged so as to define a heterojunction and in which the second semiconductor layer and a third semiconductor layer are arranged so as to define a junction, a first electrode which is connected with two dimensional carriers to appear in the vicinity of said heterojunction interface, a second electrode which is insulated from the two dimensional carriers and which is electronically connected to said third semiconductor layer and a third electrode serving as control means for the two dimensional carriers which flow between the first and the second electrodes. In general, semiconductor materials which define a heterojunction are used as the different materials of the first and second layers. In addition, the electron affinity of the first semiconductor layer may be selected to be smaller than that of the second semiconductor layer. Accordingly, carriers are induced in the second semiconductor layer at its interface with the first semiconductor layer. The forbidden band width is preferably selected to be greater in the first semiconductor layer than in the second semicomductor layer. As a result, the sum between the electron affinity and band gap of the first semiconductor layer is usually rendered greater than that of the second semiconductor layer. Regarding conductivity types, a typical construction is such that the first semiconductor layer is a p type layer or a non doped layer which is not intentionally doped with any impuirity, that the second semiconductor layer is an n type layer or a non doped layer which is not intentionally doped with any impurity, and that the third semiconductor layer is a p type layer. As the third semiconductor layer, an impurity region may be formed within a semi insulating semiconductor substrate, or an impurity region may well be provided within a semiconductor substrate identical in the conductivity type to the second semiconductor layer. Of course, transistors of both the enhancement type and the depletion type can be fabricated by applying the principle of the present invention. The types can be regulated according to the distance between the gate electrode and the heterojunction interface forming a channel, or the respective impurity concentrations and thicknesses of the first, second and third semiconductor layers. Embodiments of the invention are described below by way of example, with reference to the drawings. First, the operating principle of a new type transistor according to the present invention will be explained with reference to a sectional view Fig. 3 and an energy band diagram Fig. 4 of the element, concerning the transistor of the present invention fabricated by employing a heterojunction defined between p type GaAs and n type Al As shown in Fig. 3, a p type GaAs layer 17 which is about 200 Å to 1000 Å thick and an n type Al Parts indicated by I , II and III in Fig. 4 correspond to the layer 12, the layer 17 and a layer 18, respectively. The transistor of the present invention has a fundamental structure comprising a source electrode 29 which lies in ohmic contact with the two dimensional carriers 15, and a gate control electrode 30 which creates or extinguishes the carriers 15, and further the third semiconductor region 18 which is located directly under the control electrode 30 as well as the two dimensional carriers 15 in the present case, an n GaAs layer having a thickness of about 5000 Å , and a drain electrode 31 which lies in ohmic contact therewith. The essential feature of the transistor operation consists in that the two dimensional carriers 15 are taken out as current to the n layer 18 located vertically below, and that the concentration of the two dimensional carriers is changed by applying an external potential to the gate electrode 30, whereby the current in the vertical direction is controlled to execute the transistor operation. Shown in Fig. 4 is the energy band diagram directly under the gate electrode in the case of applying no external potential. Symbol E Now, the transistor operations in the cases of applying external potentials will be described more in detail with reference to energy band diagrams shown in Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c and Fig. 6. Shown in Fig. 5a is the energy band diagram at the time at which the source electrode is grounded to equalize the potentials of a source and a drain, whereupon a gate potential V Next, reference is had to the energy band diagrams in the cases where, besides the state of Fig. 5a, a positive drain voltage V Next, shown in Fig. 6 is the energy band diagram in the case where a negative gate potential V The fact that the transistor can have a great current derived therefrom, will be outlined by comparing this transistor with the selectively doped heterojunction type FET. Letting L On the other hand, when compared with the bipolar transistor, the transistor of the invention has the important merit that the transistor operation is executed if the thickness of the p type semiconductor layer 17 is greater than the thickness The symbols of this transistor are indicated in Fig. 7a. Numeral 30 denotes a gate electrode terminal, numeral 29 a source electrode terminal, and numeral 31 a drain electrode terminal. The transistor operations explained with reference to Figs. 5a 5c and Fig. 6 correspond to the case of a grounded source electrode in Fig. 7b. A device can of course be fabricated by connecting a drain electrode as in Fig. 7c. In the above description of the transistor operations of the present invention, the two dimensional carriers to be stored on the heterojunction interface have been electrons. The transistor of the present invention can also be fabricated by utilizing positive holes in two dimensions on the basis of the selection of materials for the heterojunction. Fig. 8 shows an energy band diagram in the case of a three layer structure which consists of a p type GaAs In the above description, the Al Needless to say, however, the present invention is effective with other heterojunctions which meet the condition that the electron gas or positive hole gas in two dimensions can be stored. Such systems are, for example, InP InGaAsP, Al The effects of the present invention can be summarized as follows Figs. 9a 9d show the principal steps of the manufacture of a semiconductor device which utilizes a two dimensional electron gas. An SiO₂ film 40 having a thickness of 5000 Å was evaporated on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10 by the use of the CVD process, and was subjected to selective chemical etching in order to form a drain region. Using the SiO₂ film as a mask, an Si ion bean 45 was injected at a dose of 2 x 10¹³ cm ² under an acceleration voltage of 100 kV, to form the impurity region 18. In this regard, the ion implantation may be performed by selecting the acceleration voltage from within a range of 20 kV to 150 kV and the dose from within a range of 0.5 x 10¹³ cm ² to 5 x 10¹³ cm ². An SiO₂ film was evaporated on the whole surface to a thickness of 5000 Å by CVD, and annealing at 820 C for 30 minutes was performed to activate the implanted Si atoms Fig. 9a . After the SiO₂ film was removed by chemical etching, a GaAs layer 17 was grown by 400 Å at a substrate temperature of 680 C in a vacuum of 10 ¹¹ torr by the use of the molecular beam epitaxy MBE process. At that time, the layer was doped with Zn atoms as acceptors to attain an acceptor concentration of 3 x 10¹⁷ cm ³. Next, an Al Subsequently, the selective etching of the Al Subsequently, SiO₂ 33 being 3000 Å thick was evaporated by the CVD process and was selectively subjected to chemical etching, thereby to be windowed for source and drain electrodes. Thereafter, a source drain metals AuGe 1000 Å Ni 200 Å Au 1100 Å were evaporated Fig. 9c . Thereafter, alloying was carried out at 450 C for 3 minutes. Numeral 29 indicates the source electrode, and numeral 31 the drain electrode. Here, it is important that the source electrode 29 and the drain region 13 are not short circuited by the diffusion of AuGe. In the current case, the closest distance L In case of the present embodiment, owing to the use of the semi insulating GaAs substrate, a restriction on the source drain distance L Since, in the present embodiment, the p type region 17 was as thin as 400 Å, an operating speed which was about 4 times higher than that of a bipolar transistor having a base layer 1000 Å thick and substantially equal dimensions was attained. Shown in Fig. 10 is a case where the transistor of the present invention was performed on a p type GaAs substrate containing Zn at a concentration of 5 x 10¹⁷ cm ³, instead of the semi insulating GaAs substrate. In order to form an n type region 18 in the semiconductor substrate 50, the ion implantation process may be employed as in Example 1. However, the thermal diffusion of Si atoms may well be employed for the purpose of improving the crystallinity of epitaxial growth on the drain region 18. The major reason therefor is that, when the layer 18 is formed by the ion implantation process, the crystallinity after the annealing worsens in some cases. As p type dopants, Be etc. are possible besides Zn. Desirable as the n type dopant of the buried layer 18 is an n type dopant whose diffusion coefficient is as small as possible. In case of using the substrate 50 of the p type, it is important for widening the margin of the transistor operation that depletion layers stretching from a source region and the drain region 18 are prevented from overlapping. Excepting the selection of the semiconductor substrate, the semiconductor device was constructed likewise to Example 1. Shown in Figs. 11a and 11b are examples of principal steps in the case where an E type transistor and a D type transistor are properly fabricated on an identical substrate. Drain regions 18, 18 , a p type GaAs layer 17 and an n type Al Figs. 12a and 12b show an embodiment in the case where an E type transistor and a D type transistor are properly fabricated on an identical substrate. Likewise to Example 1, drain regions 18, 18 were formed on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10. Subsequently, a GaAs layer 17 which contained Ge at an acceptor concentration of 5 x 10¹⁷ cm ³ and which was 500 Å thick was formed by the MBE process. Next, an Al Next, using a mixture gas consisting of CCl₂F₂ and He, the part of the GaAs layer 34 corresponding to the gate electrode of the E type transistor was selectively removed by etching, whereupon gate electrodes 30, 30 were formed. The steps of forming a source electrode 29 and drain electrodes 31, 31 were the same as in Example 1 Fig. 12b . Numeral 33 designates an insulator layer. Since the distances between the gate electrodes 30, 30 and a channel namely, the thicknesses of the layers have a difference, the concentrations of carriers to be induced in the channel become unequal, and the E type and D type transistors can be realized. Figs. 13a to 13c show examples of steps for fabricating an embodiment of the present invention being of the self alignment type in such a manner that the E type and the D type are formed on an identical substrate. Likewise to Example 1, n type semiconductor layers 18, 18 were formed in a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10 by the use of the ion implantation of Si. After annealing, a p type GaAs layer 17 containing Zn at an acceptor impurity concentration of 5 x 10¹⁶ cm ³ was grown by 1000 Å by the use of the organic metal vapor evaporation process OM VPE process . More specifically, the V III ratio between CH₃ ₃Ga and AsH₃ was set at 15, and crystal growth was conducted at a substrate temperature of 700 C. Dimethyl zinc CH₃ ₂Zn was used as a p type dopant. Subsequently, an Al In the illustration, the photoresist is windowed in a part to form the gate electrode of the D type. Using the resultant photoresist as a mask, Si ions 47 were implanted. Conditions for the implantation were an acceleration voltage of 30 kV and a dose of 1 x 10¹² cm ² Fig. 13a . Te, Se etc. heavier than Si are sometimes used as ion species. A CVD SiO₂ film was deposited by 3000 Å, and was annealed at 750 C for 20 minutes. Thereafter, in order to form drain electrodes, the n type Al Conditions for the implantation were an acceleration voltage of 50 kV and a dose of 1 x 10¹³ cm ². Subsequently, SiO₂ 3000 Å thick was deposited on the whole surface by the CVD process, and it was annealed at 800 C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, it was etched so as to leave an SiO₂ layer 33 for the isolation of electrodes, and a source electrode 29 and the drain electrodes 31, 31 were formed by the use of AuGe 1200 Å Ni 150 Å Au 1500 Å Fig. 13c . In the current case, the transistor having the gate electrode 30 is of the E type, and the transistor having the gate electrode 30 is of the D type. The present embodiment is characterized in that the D type transistor is fabricated by the ion implantation process. The reason why the ion implantation was conducted using the gate electrodes as a mask in order to form the source electrode as illustrated in Fig. 13b, is to establish ohmic contact with a two dimensional electron gas layer at a heterojunction interface under the gate electrodes 30, 30 . In the case of the present embodiment where the E type transistor is previously formed, the n type Al An embodiment in the case of employing two dimensional positive holes as carriers is shown in Figs. 14a to 14c. SiO₂ 40 of 4000 Å for forming a drain region 78 was deposited on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10 and was selectively windowed, whereupon the drain region 78 was formed using the thermal diffusion of Zn. For the thermal diffusion of Zn, diffusion sources As and Zn were placed in an ampoule, and the ampoule was vacuum sealed. The degree of vacuum was 1 x 10 ⁶ Torr. Thereafter, the diffusion was carried out under the conditions of a diffusion temperature of 650 C and a diffusion time of 30 minutes. Then, the wafer was taken out of the ampoule and was washed. Subsequently, a GaAs layer 77 containing Si at a concentration of 5 x 10¹⁷ cm ³ was crystal grown by 800 Å by the use of the MBE process. Next, a GaP SiO₂ 33 forms spacer layers for isolating the electrodes. For a heterojunction which forms two dimensional positive holes 75 to appear at the interface thereof, Ge may well be used in lieu of GaP In Examples 1 6 described above, the isolation between the elements was performed by mesa etching. The depth of the etching was approximately 1500 Å 2000 Å, and caused no hindrance to planar structures. Of course, the isolation between elements can also be executed by the use of the ion implantation of oxygen atoms etc. In all the above examples, the second and third semiconductor layers defined a homogenous junction. However, this is not always necessary, but a heterojunction may be used in some cases. For example, although Example 1 used GaAs as the third semiconductor, a semiconductor greater in the electron affinity than GaAs may well be used. In this case, even when a semiconductor smaller in the electron affinity than GaAs is used, the transistor of the present invention can be performed. The important feature of the present invention consists in that two dimensional electrons or holes stored on a heterojunction interface are caused to flow in a direction perpendicular to the heterojunction interface, thereby to provide a transistor from which a great current can be derived.
