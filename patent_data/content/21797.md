# Device for monitoring a component in a fluid mixture.

## Abstract
A device for monitoring a component in a fluid mixture includes a tube 1 , the bore of which is divided into two chambers by a disc of solid electrolyte 1a . The electrolyte is chosen to have a conducting ion related to the component to be measured. Suspension means in the form of two resilient diaphragms 7 suspend the tube within a housing including a frame member 16 and end caps 15 . Each of the diaphragms is sealed at its interface 9 with the housing, and at its interface 6 with an end of the tube. Heating means 10, 11 are provided to alter the temperature of the component in each chamber and inlet means 21 and outlet means 22 allow fluid to enter and leave the chambers. The e.m.f. between electrodes 2 is monitored and information about the fluid mixture can be obtained depending on the temperature of the mixture sensed by a thermocouple arrangement 3 .
