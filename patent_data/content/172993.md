# Low temperature curing polyester urethane systems.

## Abstract
An hydroxy functional polyurethane reaction product is disclosed which enables the provision of thermosetting solution coating compositions which cure at low tem perature to form flexible coatings. These polyurethanes are provided by the reaction of an organic diisocyanate with a stoichiometric excess of an essentially linear hydroxy functional polyester which is the polyesterification reaction product of C₄ C₁₀ aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or anhydride thereof with a stoichiometric excess of C₃ C₈ aliphatic diol providing an alcohol acid molar ratio of 3 2 to 6 5. The reaction is substantially complete as indicated by an acid number less than 10, and the diisocyanate is used in an amount providing an NCO OH ratio of from 2 3 to 12 13. The thermosetting solution coating composition is provided by an organic solvent having dissolved therein from 5 50 of total resin solids of a curing agent reactive with hydroxy groups together with the polyurethane which has been de scribed. The preferred curing agent is a partially methy lolated melamine which contains from about 5 mol percent to about 40 mol percent of the methylol group.
