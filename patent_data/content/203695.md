# Method for refining molten metal bath to control nitrogen.

## Abstract
A method for refining a molten metal bath is provided in cluding introducing a refining gas containing substantially a combination of oxygen and nitrogen to the molten bath to reduce the carbon content of the bath to a selected level there after an inert gas, such as argon, is introduced to the molten bath from a lance adapted to direct the inert gas onto or beneath the bath surface, whereby the inert gas serves to effi ciently remove nitrogen from the bath.
