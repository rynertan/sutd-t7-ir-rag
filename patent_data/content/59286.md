# Envelope.

## Abstract
An envelope 1 has a closure flap 5 connected to the envelope along a fold line 2 . A tear filament 3 is provided inside the fold line and has at least one projecting tab 4 by means of which the filament may be pulled to tear the envelope when sealed along the fold line 2 .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An envelope having a closure flap 5 , which is arranged to be folded over to seal the envelope and a filament 3 , which extends along the inside of the fold line of the closure flap, and which has at least one projecting end portion 4 the arrangement being such that when the envelope is sealed, it may be opened along the fold line by gripping and pulling the end portion so that the filament causes the envelope to tear along the fold line. 2. An envelope according to claim 1, in which the filament has at each end one of the projecting end portions 4 . 3. An envelope according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the or each projecting end portion is provided with a tab 4 . 4. An envelope according to claim 3, wherein the or each tab is provided with an adhesive so that it may be stuck down to a surface of the envelope prior to being pulled off the surface of the envelope and used to open the envelope.

## Description
ENVELOPE The invention relates to an envelope of the kind which is used for letters or other documents. Usually such envelopes have a flap which is folded over and stuck down to seal the envelope. The recipient often finds it difficult to re open the envelope without damaging the contents. Sometimes a paperknife is used but it may be difficult to insert the tip of the knife under the flap. Alternatively the envelope may be cut along close to the fold line of the closure flap, using a pair of scissors or, in an office, a guillotine, but this frequently results in a correspondingly folded portion of the contents also being cut. In accordance with the present invention, an envelope has a closure flap, which is arranged to be folded over to seal the envelope and a filament, which extends along the inside of the fold line of the closure flap, and which has at least one projecting end portion the arrangement being such that when the envelope is sealed, it may be opened along the fold line by gripping and pulling the end portion so that the filament causes the envelope to tear along the fold line. An envelope of this construction can be opened without any separate tools but quickly and without any danger of damage to the contents. The filament may have at each end one of the projecting end portions and the or each projecting end portion may be provided with a tab to facilitate gripping the projecting end portion. Each tab may be provided with an adhesive so that it may be stuck down to a surface of the envelope prior to being pulled off the surface of the envelope and used to open the envelope. This prevents the end portion being inadvertantly pulled and the envelope torn open during transit in the mail. The tab may be shaped to provide ornamentation, or to represent the logo of a particular organisation. An example of an envelope constructed in accordance with the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings,. in which Figure 1 is a rear elevation showing the envelope prior to being used Figure 2 is a similar elevation showing the envelope sealed in use and, Figure 3 is a similar view showing diagrammatically the use of the filament to open the envelope. The illustrated envelope 1 has a closure flap 5 connected to the rest of the envelope across a fold line 2. A filament 3 is stuck to the inner surface of the envelope along the fold line and has projecting ends which are provided with tabs 4. These tabs may be provided on one surface with a tacky adhesive covered by a release layer of sheet material. In use, when the contents have been put in the envelope, the closure flap 5 is folded and stuck down as shown in Figure 2 and, after removal of the release layer, the tabs 4 may be stuck down. on the outer surface of the flap. To open the envelope, as shown in Figure 3, the envelope may be gripped in one hand, and one of the tabs 4 peeled off and pulled with the other hand, so that the filament 3 tears along the fold line and exposes the contents. The filament 3 should have adequate tensile strength, depending upon the quality of the material of which the envelope is made, and may be made of a yarn of nylon or other synthetic resin material, a yarn coated with a fine glass powder, or even a metal wire.
