## Description
PREPARATION OF ZEOLITE BETA This invention relates to an improved method of preparing a partially crystalline zeolite Beta composition whereby synthesis is facilitated and of reduced cost and the product exhibits an extended high silica alumina mole ratio when compared to conventionally synthesized zeoliteBeta without the need for dealumination. The new composition prepared hereby shows surprisingly high activity and selectivity in organic compound conversion, notably in catalytic hydroisomerization processing. Crystalline zeolite Beta, which is identified by its x ray diffraction pattern, and its conventional preparation are disclosed in US A 3,308,069. A zeolite having the structure of zeolite Beta is described in EP A 55046 NU 2w and in GB A 2,024,790 Boralite B . Zeolites other than zeolite Beta are shown to be prepared from various reaction mixtures having various silica alumina reaction mixture mole ratios in US A 4,366,135 4,297,335 4,275,047 and 4,257,885.Preparation of zeolite ZSM 5 having a SiO2 content of more than 90 by weight is disclosed in EP A 40444. EP A 36683 and GB A 1,553,209 disclose reaction mixtures useful for preparing zeolites other than zeolite Beta. According to the invention a method for preparing zeolite Beta comprises forming a reaction mixture containing sources of alkali metal oxide, an organic nitrogen containing cation, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon and water and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios, within the following ranges Broad Preferred 5i02 A1203 20 1000 30 500H2O SiO2 5 200 10 100 OH SiO2 0.10 2.0 0.2 1.0M SiO2 0.01 1.0 0.05 0.20 R SiO2 0.10 2.0 0.20 1.0 wherein R is a cation derived from a tetraethylammonium compound and M is an alkali metal ion, and maintaining the mixture for from about 24 hours to about 7 days until crystallinity of the product zeolite Beta is from about 30 to about 90t. Crystallization is purposely terminated at a time which provides only from about 30 to about 90 crystallinity. Thereafter, the partially crystalline zeolite Beta is separated from the liquid and recovered.Reaction conditions required consist of heating the foregoing reaction mixture to a temperature of from about 900C to about 2000C for a period of time of from about 24 hours to about 7 days. A more preferred temperature range is from about 1500C to about 1600C with the amount of time at a temperature in such range being from about 48 hours to about 5 days. The digestion of the gel particles is carried out until zeolite Beta is formed having crystallinity from about 30 to about 90 . Crystallization is then terminated and the solid product separated from the reaction medium, as by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering and water washing. The key variables in the above reaction mixture composition are the molar ratios of OH 8iO2 and M SiO2.If OH SiO2 is not optimized within the range of 0.10 to 2.0, preferably at least 0.5, and M SiO2 is not less than 1.0, preferably less than 0.2, product other than partially crystalline Beta, e.g. ZSM 5 and ZSM 12, will result. The value of the ratio SiO2 1203 is preferably greater than 200. Fully crystalline zeolite Beta synthesized tinder conventional procedure is proven to have catalytic application, but the range of product silica alumina mole ratio is relatively limited. When the partially crystalline composition of zeolite Beta is synthesized in accordance with the present method, it exhibits silica alumina mole ratios over a wide and higher range and significantly enhanced catalytic activity for certain conversions of interest, including hydroisomerization and hydrocracking. The present method allows the reaction mixture of silica, alumina and tetraethylammonium compound to produce the desired partially crystalline zeolite Beta. The partially crystalline composition prepared hereby functions as well as fully crystalline zeolite Beta resulting in a cost savings in catalyst manufacture and needs no binder for certain applications, such as, for example, use as catalyst in hydroisomerization. Thus it is a less expensive. catalyst than zeolites requiring binder, such as fully crystalline zeolite Beta. The reaction mixture composition can be prepared from materials which supply the appropriate oxide. Such compositions include aluminates, alumina, silicates, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid and hydroxides. Each oxide component utilized in the reaction mixture for preparing the zeolite can be supplied by one or more essential reactants and they can be mixed together in any order. For example, any oxide can be supplied by an aqueous solution, sodium hydroxide or by an aqueous solution of a suitable silicate the organic cation can be supplied by the directing agent compound of that cation, such as, for example, the hydroxide or a salt, e.g. halide, such as chloride, bromide or iodide. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed. The tetraethylammonium compound may be, as nonlimiting examples, the hydroxide or a halide, e.g. bromide. The zeolite Beta composition freshly synthesised in accordance with the invention will usually conform with the formula in terms of mole ratios of oxides and in the anhydrous state 0.1 to 4 R20 0.05 to 2 M2 nO 0.1 to 5 A1203 100 SiO2 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, R is the cation derived from a tetraethylammonium compound, above described. The original cations can be replaced, at least in part, by calcination and or ion exchange with another cation. Thus, the original alkali metal cations are exchanged into a hydrogen or hydrogen ion precursor form or a form in which the original cation has been replaced by a metal of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VIB or VÃŒII of the Periodic Table. Thus, for example, it is contemplated to exchange the original cations with ammonium ions or with hydronium ions. Catalytically active forms of these would include, in particular, hydrogen, rare earth metals, aluminum, metals of Groups II and VIII of thePeriodic Table and manganese. The x ray diffraction pattern of zeolite Beta has the characteristic lines shown in Table 1. The partially crystalline Beta prepared hereby provides the same pattern. TABLE 1 Interplanar d Spacing A Relative intensity I IgL 11.5 0.3 M S 7.4 0.2 W 6.6 0.15 W 4.15 0.1 W 3.97 0.1 VS 3.00 0.07 W 2.05 0.05 W These values were determined by standard technique. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and a diffraction equipped with a scintillation counter and a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of two times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectometer chart. From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io where Io is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in Angstrom units A corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated.In Table 1 the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W weak, M medium, S strong andVS very strong. Ion exchanged forms of the zeolite manifest substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample and its thermal history. While the improved partially crystalline composition of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of organic compound, e.g. hydrocarbon compound, conversion reactions, it is notably useful in the processes of dewaxing, hydroisomerization and cracking. Other conversion processes for which partially crystalline zeolite Beta may be utilized in one or more of its active forms include, for example, hydrocracking and converting light aliphatics to aromatics such as in US A 3,760,024. Partially crystalline zeolite Beta prepared in accordance herewith can be used either in the organic nitrogen containing and alkali metal containing form, the alkali metal form and hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form. It can also be used in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such components can be exchanged into the composition, impregnated therein or physically intimately admixed therewith, for example by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a platinum metal containing ion.Suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. Combinations of metals and methods for their introduction can also be used. Partially crystalline zeolite Beta, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst, should be dehydrated at least partially, suitably by heating to a temperature in the range of from about 2000C to about 6000C in an inert atmosphere, such as air, nitrogen, etc. and at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at lower temperature merely by placing the zeolite in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a particular degree of dehydration. A thermal decomposition product of this material can be created by heating same at a temperature of up to about 6000C in an inert atmosphere for from about 1 hour to about 48 hours. As above mentioned, partially crystalline zeoliteBeta prepared in accordance herewith can have the original cations associated therewith replaced by a wide variety of other cations according to techniques well known in the art. Typical replacing cations include hydrogen, ammonium and metal cations including mixtures thereof. Of the replacing metallic cations, particular preference is given to cations of metals such as rare earths, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn,Cd, Pd, Ni, Cu, Ti, Al, Sn, Fe and Co. Typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic zeolite with a salt of the desired replacing cation or cations. Although a wide variety of salts can be employed, particular preference is given to chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. Catalysts comprising zeolite Beta prepared according to the invention may be formed in a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystalline silicate can be extruded before drying or dried or partially dried and then extruded. Although not necessary for most applications, when it is desired to composite the partially crystalline zeolite Beta hereby prepared with another material, active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides, e.g. alumina, may be used, as described in our EP A 1695. Employing a catalytically active form of the composition of this invention containing a hydrogenation component, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature between 3700C and 5400C. The pressure can be between 100 and 1000 psig 7.9 to 70 bar , but is preferably between 200 and 700 psig 14.8 to 49.3 bar .The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between 0.1 and 1C hr l, preferably between 0.5 and 4 hr l and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is generally between 1 and 20, preferably between 4 and 12. The catalyst can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins, when provided with a hydrogenation component, e.g. platinum. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature between 900C to 3700C, preferably 1400C to 2900C, with a liquid hourly space velocity between 0.01 and 2 hr l, preferably between 0.25 and 0.50 hr l, employing hydrogen such that the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is between 1 and 5. Additionally, the catalyst can be used for oleo in or aromatics isomerization employing temperatures between OOC and 3700C. The catalyst can also be used for reducing the pour point of gas oils. This process is carried out at a liquid hourly space velocity between about 0.1 and about 10 hr l and a temperature between about 2500C and about 5400C and a pressure of between about 100 psig 7.9 bar and about 2000 psig 138.9 bar . Other reactions which can be accomplished employing the catalyst of this invention containing a noble metal, e.g platinum, or a non noble metal, e.g. nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, cobalt and combinations thereof, include hydrocracking, hydrogenation dehydrogenation reactions and desulfurization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization , and other organic compound conversions such as the conversion of alcohols e.g methanol to hydrocarbons. In the following Examples product crystallinity is expressed as the ratio of the intensity of the reflection at two theta 22.50 to that of a standard sample of zeolite Beta.

The resulting solution was mixed with 21.0 grams of HiSil silica gel precipitated hydrated SiO2 containing about 6 weight percent free B2O and 4.5 weight percent bound H20 of hydration and having a particle size of about 0.02 micron . The solution was then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 days. The reaction mixture had the same composition in mole ratios as that of Example 1, save that the value of the ratio TEA SiO2 was 0.1. After digestion period the hydrogel was transferred to a 300 ml stainless steel autoclave and reacted with stirring 400 rpm at 1600C. The crystallization was terminated at 5 days. The final solid product was processed as inExample 1. X ray analysis of the product showed the material to be 90 crystalline zeolite Beta. It had aSiO2 A1203 mole ratio of 156. EXAMPLE4 A 0.32 gram quantity of NaAlO2 and 1.26 grams ofNaCl were dissolved in 41.2 grams of deionized water. To this solution was added 130.2 ml of 3.45 N tetraethylammonium hydroxide.

The reaction mixture had the composition, in mole ratios SiO2 A1203 400 H20 Si02 10 OH SiO2 0.90 Na SiO2 0.05 TEA SiO2 0. 90 The mixture was reacted at 1600C with stirring at 400 rpm. Reaction was permitted to proceed for 24 hours. X ray analysis of this product proved it to be 90 crystalline zeolite Beta. It had a SiO2 A1203 mole ratio of 106. EXAMPLE 5 A 1.5 gram quantity of NaAlO2 was dissolved in 63.0 grams of deionized water. A second solution was produced by dissolving 15.6 grams of tetraethylammonium bromide in 60.2 ml of 3.42 N tetraethylammonium hydroxide, then mixing it with the first solution.

Its SiO2 A1203 molar ratio was 43. EXAMPLE 6 A zeolite Beta composition in accordance with the invention was tested for hydroisomerization of hexadecane.Three different catalysts were tested to provide comparison. The first catalyst was a fully crystalline zeolite Beta synthesized in accordance with US A 3,308,069 and having a silicaXalumina mole ratio of 30. The second catalyst was the dealuminized product of the fully crystalline first catalyst. Dealumination was conducted by extraction with acid in accordance with the method described in EP A 95304. The third catalyst was the product of Example I hereof. Prior to testing, each catalyst was exchanged to the ammonium form with 1M NH4Cl solution at 900 reflux for an hour followed by platinum 0.6 wit. exchange of the tetrammine complex at room temperature overnight. The platinum exchanged material was thoroughly washed, oven dried at 1300C and air calcined at 3500C. The catalysts were then placed, in turn, in a reactor and contacted with hexadecane in the presence of hydrogen. The test temperature was maintained at 2503500C, the pressure at 500 psig 34.5 bar , and the liquid hourly space velocity at 1 hr l, Product Iso C16 and conversion percentages were measured over the test. From the results presented in Table 2 it can be seen that the partially crystalline zeolite Beta composition performed essentially as effectively as the much more expensive dealuminized fully crystalline zeolite Beta, and significantly better than the fully crystalline Beta having a silicÃ¡ alumina mole ratio of 30.
