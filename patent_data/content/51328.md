# Process for the preparation of alcohols.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of alcohols by reacting an olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbon with water in the presence of an alpha hydroxysulphonic acid prepared by reacting a carbonyl compound of the general formula R₁R₂CO, wherein R₁ and R₂ are individually hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group containing up to 7 carbon atoms, with sulphur dioxide and water.
