# Digital switch module.

## Abstract
A digital switch module 10 for a digital switching system for time division switching operations comprising an encoding laws conversion memory 11 which realizes mutual conversion of encoding laws of different types, for example, conversion between the A law an u law for voice signal encoding and constituted read only memory, and a a control memory 12 which designates conversion between encoding laws by such encoding laws conversion memory for each time slot. Conversion or no conversion of encoding laws is dynamically controlled according to time slot by the control memory 12 , even in the event tnat digital signals in different kinds of encoding laws exist on the highway, by utilizing the input and output side data obtained by setting the channel path of the digital switching system.
