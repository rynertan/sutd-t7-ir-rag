# Noise reducing housing for a static induction apparatus.

## Abstract
A static induction apparatus including a vessel 1 for containing a main body 4 of the static induction apparatus, a plurality of reinforcing support members 3 secured to side plates 2 of the vessel 1 and a sound reducing structure. The sound reducing structure includes a plurality of sound reducing members 9 sup ported between the reinforcing support members 3 and each including a sound insulating panel 11 com posed of high damping metal plate, a resilient plate 10 formed of thin metal sheet material interposed between the sound insulating panel 11 and the reinforcing mem bers 3 , and a weight member 12 secured to the vicinity of the boundary between the sound insulating panel 11 and the resilient plate 10 .
