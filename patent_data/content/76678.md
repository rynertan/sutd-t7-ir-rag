# Process for ammoxidation of organic compounds.

## Abstract
The activity of a tellurium free metal oxide catalyst used for ammoxidation of organic compounds at a temperature of from 300 C to 600 C is improved in the presence of a elemental tellurium or a tellurium compound which is in contact with said catalyst or in the presence of a elemental tellurium or a tellurium compound and b a molybdenum compound which are in contact with said catalyst. This activity improvement process can be applied to both the fresh catalysts and the spent catalyst having a deteriorated activity. The above described component a is preferably composed of a tellurium containing solid to be used in a state of a dry physical mixture with said catalyst. The above described components a and b are preferably composed of a tellurium containing solid and a molybdenum containing solid respectively or a tellurium molybdenum containing solid to be used in a state of a dry physical mixtured with said catalyst. The tellurium containing solid, the molybdenum con taining solid or the tellurium molybdenum containing solid may be at least a member selected from the following group 1 A solid wherein a tellurium component and or a molybdenum component is supported or unsupported on an inert carrier, 2 A solid wherein a tellurium component and or a molybdenum component is added to a metal oxide catalyst fresh or spent and or said metal oxide catalyst is enriched with the tellurium component and or the molybdenum component, and 3 A solid composed of a compound containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, La, Ce, V, Nb, Cr, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, B, Aâ„“, Ga, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, As, Sb, Bi, S and Se in addition to tellurium, molybdenum or tellurium and molybdenum, or a mixture of these compounds, supported or unsupported on an inert carrier. The present invention is advantageously applied to ammoxidation in a fluidized bed.
