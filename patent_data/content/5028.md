# Bolt tensioning device.

## Abstract
Hydraulic bolt tightening means comprises a body 10 , a piston 16, 18 mounted in the body, the piston 16, 18 and the body 10 being of generally annular configuration to allow the device to be assembled in encircling fashion to a bolt or like component 44 , and an annular chamber 12 between the body 10 and the piston 16, 18 for the admission of fluid under pressure to effect relative axial displacement of the body 10 and the piston 16, 18 whereby the axial dimension is increased, the piston comprising an inner part 16 having a pressure area which is subject to the pressure in said chamber 12 and an outer part 18 to which the fluid pressure is transmitted via said inner part 16 and an interposed mass of solid, yielding and substantially incompressible material 20 received in a recess or groove in said outer piston part 18 and whose effective pressure area is less than that of said inner piston part whereby, in use, said mass is caused to expand radially so as to seal against leakage of fluid from the chamber 12 while at the same time transmitting the pressure to the outer piston part 18 .
