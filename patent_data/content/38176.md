# Serial printer for objects movable in a predetermined direction.

## Abstract
The printer is included in an apparatus for depositing valu ables in envelopes, which are conveyed to a depositor at a con stant speed by conveyor belts 21, 22. The printer includes a type wheel 61 inked by a removable inking roller 68 and selec tively rotatable by a stepping motor, each time from the angu lar position of the previous printed character. A guiding roller 73 normally holds the envelope distanced from the type wheel 61 and is removed at a constant rate by an electromagnetic EM2 for causing the envelope to be printed under the bias of a springloaded pressure roller 79. In the interval between two subsequent character printing operations, the envelope is ad vanced one letter space, whereas the type wheel 61 has time to be rotated at least one complete revolution.
