# NUMERICAL CONTROL UNIT.

## Abstract
A numerical control unit in which a motor is driven at the feed speed designated by a feed speed designation dial. Potentiometers f1 to f7 generate the D.C. voltage prop ortional to the amount a knob of the feed speed designation dial is turned, an AD converter 20 selectively receives the D.C. voltage from a potentiometer and converts this voltage into a digital quantity, and a main processor section CPU reads the output of the AD converter 20 and generates a feed speed designation signal.
