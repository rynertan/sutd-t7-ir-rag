# Epoxy resin compositions.

## Abstract
A hardenable epoxy resin comprising a curable epoxy resin, a hardener for the epoxy resin and a polymer of epi halohydrin which composition is characterised in that the amount of the polymer of epihalohydrin in the composition is from 1 to 6 parts per one hundred parts by weight of the epoxy resin and in that the composition also comprises from 2 to 25 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of the epoxy resin, of a polycarbonate having the general formula
