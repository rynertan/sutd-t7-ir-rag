## Description
A Decontamination Apparatus The apparatus of this invention is primarily designed for use by the nuclear industry for decontamination of radioactive contaminated surfaces. Its use, however, is applicable to and will extend into many other industrial and institutional facilities. The apparatus consists of a system that will provide continuous fluid flow C from ambient temperatures up to 500 F. Flow, temper ature and pressure valves and gauges are provided for permitting the operator to select the optimum parameters for the clean up being performed. The apparatus includes a vacuum spray head which consists of a shroud and a water steam manifold capable of emitting fluid and steam under pressure onto the surfaces to be cleaned. The spray head also includes a vacuum pick up and provides a series of surface engaging rollers for ease in movement thereover.The apparatus also includes a vacuum power unit which could be either an air operated jet type or a positive displacement vacuum pump. The recovery and discharge system includes a cyclone separator, demister, filters, absorbers, all of the construction and configuration relating to the specific cleaning application as required. A further object of this invention is to provide in an apparatus a means for developing high liquid temperatures and spraying the same under pressure onto the surface to be cleaned. The combination of high temperature and pressure of the cleaning fluid induces the flashing of the fluid to steam at its point of discharge from the spray head, thereby providing a high temperature scrubbing action upon the contaminated surface being cleaned. Simultaneously with the cleaning activity the air flow and vacuum induced in the retrieving system, picks up the water ladened contamination removed from the surface being cleaned and transfers it to the discharge system of the apparatus. This discharge system in turn separates the air and liquid mixture with each being separately filtered and contained for removal. Other objects of the invention will be hereinafter made apparent. The invention will be best understood by reference to the accompanying drawings showing the preferred mode of embodiment by which the objects of the invention are achieved, and in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the apparatus of the invention Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view of the fluid heating and control system as embodied in this invention Fig 3 is a side elevational and partial detailed view of the recovery unit of this invention Fig. 4 is a side elevational view of the vacuum spray head and its attachments Fig. 5 is a side elevational view showing in dotted lines the dispensing manifold and roller supports for the vacuum spray head of the device Fig. 6 is a detailed end elevational view of the spray head of the invention Fig. 7 is a detailed side elevational view of a modified spray head of the invention Fig. 8 is a detailed end elevational view of the modified spray head of the invention and Fig. 9 is a perspective view of an air diffuser as employed in this invention. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown the apparatus of this invention as consisting of a first mobile cart 10 and a companion mobile housing 11. A fluid pressure line 12 extends from the cart 10 to a combined vacuum spray head 13. A vacuum retrieving hose 14 extends between the head 13 and the housing 11. Both cart 10 and housing 11 are provided with hinged doors 15 and removable access panels 16, respectively. The interior of the cart 10 is schematically shown in Fig. 2 where there is illustrated a hose connection 17, together with a pressure indicator 18, a gate valve 19, and a check valve 20, all connecting the hose connector 17 with the turbine pump 21. From the pump through a line 22 the induction flow of the fluid passes through a flow switch 23. From the flow switch 23 through a line 24 which includes a pressure indicator 25, a rotometer 26 , the fluid is introduced through the inlet port 26 into a heating element 27. From the heating element 27 through a main line 28 which includes a pressure indicator 29, valves 30 and 31, and a filter 32, the heated liquid is entrained in the spray line 12 leading to the head 13. The liquid spray line 12 is connected to a dispensing manifold, generally H shaped in design, within the spray head 13 through an internal coupling tube 33. This tube 33 is connected into a cross tube 34, that in turn has open communication to a pair of elongated horizontally arranged dispensing tubes 35 and 36. As shown in Fig. 6, the dispensing tubes are adjacent to the opposite lowermost edges of the shroud 37 of the head 13.Periodically along the lengths of these dispensing tubes 35 and 36, and at approximately one inch intervals, there is provided a series of dispensing orifices 38. By this arrangement, the heated fluid under pressure is directed downwardly and inwardly of the side walls of the shroud 37 of the head 13 and into a defined cleaning area wherein flashing, that is the creating of steam under pressure, occurs. Within spray head 13 and extending from the top wall 39 of the shroud 37 are a plurality of pins 40. Projecting axially of the pins 40 are threaded shanks 41 upon which are threaded the mountings 42 of roller casters 43. As seen inFigs. 5 and 6, the casters 43 extend below the bottom edge of the shroud 37 of the spray head 13. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a rotatable union 44 which connects the spray line 12 to the internal tube 33. Likewise, the spray head 13 through a swivel joint 45 is connected to the end of the recovery hose 14. It is thus apparent that the spray head 13 is universally movable as it is propelled over the surface to be cleaned. Fig. 3 illustrated the interior of the housing 11. The recovery hose 14 through a coupler 46 is connected to the intake 47 of the vacuum operated recovery system. The intake 47 has communication with a cyclone separator 48. This cyclone separator 48 will function to separate air laden contaminants from liquid laden contaminants, the latter falling to the bottom of the separator 48 for collection and disposal. The air laden contaminants will pass through a piping 49 wherein they will strike a distributor plate 50 before passing through a demister 51. Further movement, through the path, as indicated by the arrows, causes the same to pass through a high efficiency particle air filter 52.Continued movement will cause the same to pass through an absorber 53 and a second filter 54 before passing into the outlet plenum 55. The vacuum is created by a suitable vacuum pump 56 illustrated as being mounted upon the rear of the housing 11. Fig. 9 illustrated a pre filter distribution plate 50 and, as such, includes a mounting frame 57. Attached to the inner walls of opposite side members of the frame 57 are a pair of angle irons 58 only one being shown . These angle irons 58 present a flat surface 59 upon which the side flanges 60 of the plate 50 are connected. The plate 50 is formed in a wedge formation with the apex 61 of the wedge projecting into the direction of the air flow as shown in Fig. 3. Each of the wings 62 of the wedge shaped plate 50 are perforated as at 63. By this arrangement, the air flow through the distributor plate 50 will cause the flow to impinge upon and through the entire parameter of the filter 51 for optimum performance. In Figs. 7 and 8 there is disclosed a modified vacuum spray head 64. This spray head 64 includes a shroud 65 one wall of which provides an external collar coupler 66 for ready attachment to the vacuum hose 14. The liquid feed line 12 will have connection to a hollow tube 67 which, in turn, has open communication as at 68 with a manifold line tube 69. Periodically throughout the length of the manifold 69 there are depending spray nozzles 70.These nozzles 70 are by suitable clamps 71 connected to the line pipe 69 and have internal open communication therewith. The dispensing tips 72 of the nozzles 70 may be disposed to dispense liquid therefrom in a downward direction within the confines of the shroud 65. Within the shroud 65 and mounted on a U shaped bracket 73 which by suitable fasteners 74 are mounted to the interior opposite longitudinal walls of the shroud 65 are a plurality of surface engaging casters or rollers 75. The modified vacuum spray head 64 functions in the same manner as the spray head 13 and can be interchangeable therewith. In developing these two configurations of the manifolds we are able to obtain optimum cleaning effectiveness by providing the operator the capability of selecting the manifold and vacuum spray head best suited for specific cleaning operations. Utilization of the decontamination apparatus of this invention removes decontamination at the source, thereby minimizing its spread and exposure to personnel. This equipment by utilizing an air liquid separating system reduces waste generated by its use, thus substantially reducing costs of the decontamination operation and disposal of the removed material. Through the utilization of this invention which is unique in that it cleans the decontaminated surfaces more thoroughly in less time and eliminates the undesirable features of present known, currently used, methods. While we have illustrated and described the preferred form of construction for carrying our invention into effect, this is capable of variation and modification without departing from the spirit of the invention. We, therefore, do not wish to be limited to the precise details of construction as set forth, but desire to avail ourselves of such variations and modifications as come within the scope of the appended claims.
