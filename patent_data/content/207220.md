# PROCESS FOR PREPARING A STABILIZED CHROMIUM III PROPIONATE SOLUTION AND ITS USE IN FORMATION TREATMENT

## Abstract
A process for preparing clear green chromium III prop ionate solutions which comprises admixing such as propionic acid with water, a chromium VI source such as dichromate, adding thereto a nitrite, such as sodium nitrite, to reduce the chromium VI to chromium III , in the presence of excess acid, preferably propionic acid, optionally combined with addition al acid such as muriatic acid, to produce a stable solution useful with polymers, such as partially hydrolyzed acryla mide based polymers, in permeability contrast correction procedures for high permeability streaks in oil field treat ments.
