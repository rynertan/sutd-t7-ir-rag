# Door glass runs in motor vehicle.

## Abstract
Construction of door glass runs in a motor vehicle, wherein there are provided vertical side glass runs 12 and a top side glass run 14 , which are secured to vertical sides 10A and a top side 10B of a door frame 10 , respectively, in vehicle door with the door frame 10 the vertical side glass runs 12 slidably guide a forward end sliding portion 18A of a slider 18 in the opening or closing direction of a door glass 16 and restrain the forward end sliding portion 18A in the direction of thickness of the door glass 16 , the slider 18 is mounted to end edges 16A of the door glass 16 in the longitudinal direction thereof, and has the forward end sliding portion 18 shifted into a compartment 20 and being of a crank shape in cross section and the top side glass run 14 has an inner lip 14A for contacting the inner surface of a top end edge 16B of the door glass 16 to seal when the door glass 16 is fully closed the inner lip 14A in the top side glass run 14 is decreased in cross section thereof toward the vertical side glass runs 12 within a range X of contacting the slider 18 when the door glass 16 is fully closed, made gradually thinner at the distal ends 14C thereof in wall thickness than the other general portion thereof and thicker at the proximal ends 14D thereof in wall thickness that the other general portion thereof.
