## Description
POLYAMPHOLYTES AND THEIR USES Polyampholytes are polymers containing both a cationic and an anionic mer unit, nonionic mer units optionally being present.Polyampholytes have found particular use as retention aids in the paper industry see for example, U.S. Patents US A 3,639,208 andUS A 4,171,417 . There has also been some use of polyampholytes in the oil drilling industry see for example, published British Patent Application CB A 2,044,32 I and U.S. Patent US A 4,330,450 . Scale deposits are incrustation coatings which may be formed from a wide variety of simple and complex inorganic salts that accumulate on the metallic surfaces of a water carrying system through a number of different causes. Various industrial and commercial water carrying systems are subject to scale formation problems. Scale is of particular concern in heatexchange systems using water, for example, boiler systems and once through and open recirculating water cooling systems. Corrosion of metal in aqueous systems is usually caused by the presence of dissolved oxygen in the water. Currently available corrosion inhibitors include phosphorus containing inorganic and organic compounds, zinc, chromates, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides, and polycarboxylates, such as polymaleic anhydride, and their adducts. Drilling fluids are used in the drilling of earth formations to tap subterranean deposits such as gas or oil. The drilling fluid serves to cool and lubricate the drill bits, to carry the cuttings to the surface as the drilling fluid is circulated in and out of the well, to support at least part of the weight of the drill pipe and drill bit, to provide a hydrostatic pressure head to prevent caving of the walls of the well bore, to deposit on the surface of the well bore a filter cake which acts as a thin semi impervious layer to prevent undue passage of fluids, and to perform other functions as are well known in the drilling art.It is important that the drilling fluid should exhibit a relatively low rate of filtration or fluid loss, and in addition that it should have desirable rheological properties such as viscosity and gel strength. it is also important that the drilling fluid system should be kept as simple and inexpensive as possible in order to avoid undue expense in the drilling of the well. Oil producing formations are generally porous layers having varying degrees of permeability to the flow of fluids such as oil, water and gas.Consequently, the rate of oil production is largely determined by the rate of flow through these permeable formations which, in turn, is dependent upon the porosity or permeability of the sand or stone present. In drilling through such a porous layer, it is desirable to use a drilling fluid having characteristics that prevent excessive amounts of liquids or solids from penetrating through the porous formation. The ability of the drilling fluid to prevent excessive penetration of formation fluid is called filtration control. Acrylic and methacrylic derivatives, such as those that are copolymerized with hydrocarbon substituted styrenes, such as alpha methylstyrene, para methylstyrene, and 2,4 dimethylstyrene have been utilized in drilling fluids, see for example, U.S. Patents US A 2,718,497 and US A 2,650,905 . Acrylic acid derivatives, such as copolymers of acrylamide and sodium acrylate derivatives, have been frequently used commercially as flocculants for drilling fluids, as is disclosed in U.S. Patents US A 3,558,545 and US A 3,472,325. Similarly, a copolymer derived from acrylic acid and acrylamide is disclosed in U.S. Patent US A 3,323,603 as a flocculant for aqueous drilling fluids.Published British Patent Application GB A 2,044,321 discloses a copolymer additive prepared from 1 a meth acrylamido alkyl sulfonic acid or alkali metal salt thereof and 2 a meth acrylamide or N alkyl meth acrylamide. The copolymer may be crosslinked with a quaternary ammonium salt. In producing oil from both natural and artificial water driven oil reservoirs, the wells ultimately produce sufficiently large volumes of connate water to constitute a serious operating problem and eventually production of the water forces abandonment of the well. The cost of raising water to the Earth s surface and of separating it from the oil represents an economic loss and, in addition, in many instances, there is a problem in disposal of the waste water. Even more important, the total volume of fluid that can be produced daily is often limited by the well bore and artificial lift equipment so that water production unnecessarily reduces the oil production rate. In many instances, a portion of the reservoir is producing essentially all water, while the remainder is producing a substantial quantity of oil.If production from the watered out portion of the reservoir is eliminated or reduced, the production, handling and disposal of large volumes of water is avoided. Certain polymers can reduce the water oil production ratio so more oil is produced while handling less waterThis results in major savings in operating costs, the avoidance of unnecessary depletion of the water drive, and increased production from the remaining oil interval which results in greater ultimate recovery and greater current income. U.S. Patent US A 4,330,450 is directed to amphoteric water in oil self inverting polymer emulsions containing polymer having 1 to 35 parts by weight anionic monomer units in the polymer. The primary use disclosed is in paper making. Their use in secondary and tertiary oil recovery is suggested. However, polymers containing 1 to 35 parts by weight of anionic monomer units were found to be poor polymers to enhance oil recovery. The use of polyampholytes as scale and corrosion inhibitors appears unknown. The present invention provides a method of inhibiting corrosion and scale in an aqueous system comprising adding an effective amount of a polyampholyte or a salt thereof to the aqueous system. The polyampholyte is preferably a carboxylic functional polyampholyte. Also, in accordance with the invention there is provided an aqueous drilling fluid comprising an aqueous clay dispersion and a polyampholyte, preferably a carboxylic functional polyampholyte, or a salt thereof. Such an aqueous drilling fluid is, in accordance with the invention, used in a method for drilling a well in a subterranean formation comprising circulating into the well, during drilling, the said aqueous drilling fluid. The invention also provides a method of recovering oil andlor gas from a subterranean formation penetrated by a well bore and for reducing the concomitant production of reservoir water from it, comprising injecting into the formation through the well bore an aqueous treating solution or emulsion containing a polyampholyte, preferably a carboxylic or sulfonic functional polyampholyte, or a salt thereof. The invention also provides a carboxylic polyampholyte polymer, having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.05 to 4.5 in 1.0 M NaCI. While the method and compositions of the present invention have been found particularly useful in providing inhibition of calcium phosphate scales and silica polymerization, inhibition of magnesium hydroxide, calcium fluoride, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and other scales may also be obtained. The preferred anionic component is a carboxylic functional monomer. Any carboxylic functional monomer, or its salt, may be used. Examples include acrylic acid, crotonic acid, methacrylic acid, vinyl acetic acid, allylacetic acid, 4 methyl 4 pentenoic acid, and dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid and itaconic acid. The preferred carboxylic functional monomers are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. Mixtures of carboxylic functional monomers may be used in preparing the polyampholyte. Sulfonic functional polyampholytes are especially effective in enhanced oil recovery applications. Any cationic containing monomer may be used. The preferred cationic containing monomers are EMI7.1 where R3is hydrogen, phenyl, or C1 3 alkyl, preferably hydrogen or methyl R is a straight or branched chain of from 1 to 12 and preferably I to 3 carbon atoms and X is an anion, preferably a halide or alkyl sulfate. Other examples of X include sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, hydroxide, borate, cyanide, carbonate, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, isocyanate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, silicate, sulfide, cyanate and acetate other common inorganic and organic anions are also suitable. Specific examples of the particularly preferred cationic containing monomers include diethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate and methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride.Mixtures of cationic containing monomers may be used in preparing the polyampholyte. The polyampholyte may also be prepared by polymerizing a monomer containing a tertiary amine as the pendant group with subsequent quaternization of the nitrogen in the polymer to form the cationic mer units. Likewise, sulfur containing and phosphorus containing monomers may be exhaustively methylated to form cations. One or more non ionic monomers may optionally be used. Examples include acrylamide and its derivatives, such as methacrylamide and N,Ndimethyl acrylamide acrylonitrile vinyl acetate vinyl pyridine hydroxyalkyl acrylates methacrylate and its derivatives butadiene styrene and its derivatives, including substituted styrenes esters of olefinic carboxylic acids alkylene oxides divinyl ketones vinyl ketones divinyl ethers and alkyl vinyl ethers. The preferred non ionic monomer is acrylamide.Mixtures of non ionic monomers may be used in preparing the polyampholyte The particularly preferred carboxylic functional polyampholytes are polymers, preferably terpolymers prepared from i at least one carboxylic functional monomer of the formula EMI9.1 in which each R, which may be the same as or different from the other, is hydrogen, phenyl, C1 3 alkyl or COOX, preferably hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, R1 is a straight or branched chain of from 0 to 12, preferably 0 to 3, carbon atoms, and X is hydrogen or an alkali or alkaline earth metal, preferably hydrogen, sodium, potassium or caesium ii optionally, at least one non ionic monomer, preferably of the formula EMI9.2 where each R6, which may be the same as or different from the other, is hydrogen, phenyl or C1 3 alkyl, preferably hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl, and each R2, which may be the same as or different from the other, is hydrogen or c1 3 alkyl, and iii at least one cationic containing monomer, preferably one containing a quaternary ammonium, phosphonium or sulfoniumion. Non ionic monomer may be used, and subsequently hydrolysed to obtain the desired amount of anionic component. Likewise, a copolymer may be prepared from non ionic monomer and cationic monomer with subsequent hydrolysis of the non ionic monomer to form the anionic portion, e.g. acrylamide can be hydrolysed to form acrylic acid. The term aqueous , as used herein, is intended to include water in any physical state and to include water in which is dissolved or dispersed any substance, for example, inorganic salts in brine or seawater. The polyampholyte polymers may be prepared by mixing the monomers preferably in the presence of a free radical initiator. Any free radical initiator may be used. Examples include peroxides, azo initiators and redox systems. The preferred catalysts are sodium persulfate or a mixture of ammonium persulfate and any azo type initiator, such as 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethyl 4 methoxyvaleronitrile . The polymerization may also be initiated photochemically. The polyampholyte may be made by any of a variety of procedures, for example, in solution, suspension, bulk and emulsions. The temperature is not critical. The reaction will generally occur between 10 and 1000C., preferably 40 to 600C. It is generally impractical to run the reaction below room temperature because the reaction is too slow. Above a temperature of 600C., the molecular weight of the polymer tends to decrease. The reaction, depending on the temperature, generally takes from 1 to 12 hours. Measuring for residual monomer will verify when the reaction is complete. The pHof the reaction mixture is not critical.The pH is generally in the range of 4.5 to 9.0. The molecular weight of ampholytic polymers is difficult to accurately measure. The polymers are instead, usually identified by intrinsic viscosity. The intrinsic viscosity of the polyampholyte is not critical in the instant invention. It is preferred that the intrinsic viscosity be at least .05 dl g.in 1.0 M sodium chloride measured on a 75 CannonUbbelohde capillary viscometer . Scale and Corrosion The polymer may be produced from any ratio of the monomers. It is preferred for scale and corrosion inhibition that the polymer be prepared from 5 to 90 , most preferably 22.5 to 70 , by weight, carboxylic functional monomer 0.5 to 85 , most preferably 2.5 to 25 , by weight, cationic monomer and 0 to 85 , more preferably 1.5 to 85 , and most preferably 5 to 67.5 , by weight, non ionic monomer. The treatment concentration of the polyampholyte employed in the present invention to inhibit corrosion and scale deposit and formation is generally at least 0.1 ppm, preferably 0.1 to 500 ppm by weight of the total solution of the water carrying system being treated. Preferably, the concentration level range will be from about 1.0 to 200 ppm. The aqueous system may be any aqueous system, for example, a cooling water, boiler water, desalination or gas scrubber system. If the system isca desalination system, the polyampholyte should have an intrinsic viscosity below 2.8 dl g in 1.0 M sodium chloride. Drilling Muds The clay dispersion may be any finely divided solid which is capable of being dispersed or suspended in an aqueous liquid vehicle. Ordinarily, such material will include hydratable clay or colloidal clay bodies such as Wyoming bentonite, commerical medium yield drilling clays mined in various parts of the country such as in Texas,Tennessee and Louisiana, and those produced when clayey subsurface formations are drilled. Weighting materials added to increase specific gravity such as barites, iron oxide, and the like may also be included. The aqueous medium may be fresh water such as is obtained from wells or streams it may be salt water from the sea or from wells or, it may even include oil in water emulsions, i.e. water which has become contaminated in some way with small quantities of oil, or to which such oil has been added to gain some desired advantage. It is contemplated that the drilling muds of the invention may also contain other additives besides the polymers of the invention. Materials such as caustic, quebracho, lime and the like may be added to the drilling mud at the surface while other materials such as gypsum, shale and the like may be encountered in subsurface formations during drillig operations. When employed in accordance with the invention, the polymer may be added directly to the drilling mud as a dry powder, as a slurry suspended in a suitable liquid, or as a solution in water or some other suitable solvent, and they may be incorporated in it at any convenient point in the mud circulation system. It may be desirable to employ a mixing device such as a cone and jet mixer or the equivalent for incorporating the additive in the mud. Any carboxylic functional polyampholyte, or a salt of it may be used.The anionic mer unit contains the carboxyl group. It is preferred although not required that at least 10 mole percent or, in terms of weight percent, at least 5 , by weight, of the polyampholyte be made up of anionic mer units. It is preferred for drilling mud applications that the polymer be prepared from 5 to 90 percent, especially 32.5 to 85 percent, by weight, carboxylic functional monomer 0.5 to 85 percent, especially 1.5 to 40 percent, by weight, cationic monomer and 0 to 85 percent, especially 5 to 65 percent, by weight, non ionic monomer. The quantity of the polymer to be used in drilling mud applications will vary with circumstances over a reasonably wide range and the amount used in a specfic suspension or dispersion will depend on these circumstancs and the characteristics of the drilling fluid treated. Ordinarily, satisfactory results with regard to water loss reduction will be obtained with quantities ranging from 1 to 4 pounds per 42 gallon barrel 928.5 to 114 kg m3 of drilling mud. For optimum reduction in fiItration rate with certain drilling muds, however, quantities up to 6 pounds per 42 gallon barrel 171 kg m3 may be required. On the other hand, in some cases where, for example, only small improvement in filtration rate is desired, as little as 0.125 pound of the additive per barrel.5 kg m3 of will produce the desired effect.The exact amount to be added, as previously pointed out, depends upon the original character of the mud and on the properties desired. This can be determined, as is customary in the field, by simple tests at the time the addition is made. The carboxylic functional polyampholyte may be prepared by mixing the monomers, preferably in the presence of a free radical initiator. Any free radical initiator may be used. Examples include peroxides, azo initiators and redox systems. The polymerization may also be initiated photochemically. The preferred catalysts are sodium persulfate or a mixture of ammonium persulfate and any azo type initiator, such as 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethyl 4 methoxyvaleronitrile . Enhanced Oil Recovery The concentration of amphoteric polymer treating agent in the aqueous solution pumped down the well may vary over a wide range, from about 1 ppm to about 5 percent by weight. The optimum concentration will depend, to a large extent, upon the volume of reservoir water with which the treating solution will be diluted in the formation and the crude oil viscosity. It is preferred to adjust the concentration of treating agent, and the volume of the aqueous slug injected, so that the concentration of treating agent in the formation waters will be between about 0.01 percent and 0.5 percent by weight. It is further preferred that the volume of the aqueous slug injected be between about 0.02 percent and 5 percent of the oil volume in the oil recovery area around the given producing well being treated. It is preferred for enhanced oil recovery applications that the polymer be prepared from 40 to 90 percent, most preferably 47 to 70 percent, by weight, anionic containing monomer 0.5 to 60 percent, most preferably 1.5 to 33 percent, by weight, cationic containing monomer 0 to 59.5 percent, most preferably 20 to 48 percent, by weight, non ionic monomer. It is preferred that the anionic containing monomer be of the formula EMI16.1 wherein R, which may be the same sr different, is hydrogen, a phenyl or an alkyl group of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R1 is a straight or branched chain of from 0 to 12 carbon atoms, X is NHCH2C CH3 2S03Y or OY, and Y is hydrogen or an alkali or alkaline earth metal. It is preferred that the polyampholyte for enhanced oil recovery be prepared from an anionic containing monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinyl acetic acid, crotonic acid, allylacetic acid, 4 methyl 4 pentenoic acid and acrylamide methyl propane sulfonic acid a cationic containing monomer selected from the group consisting of dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate and methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, and optionally a non ionic monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylamide and its derivatives, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, butadiene, vinyl pyridine, methacrylate and its derivatives, and styrene and its derivatives. The most preferred polymer for this use is prepared from acrylic acid, methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate and acrylamide. In contrast to the other uses disclosed herein, the higher the intrinsic viscosity of the polymers, the better they appear to work. Intrinsic viscosities of 10 to 20 are preferred. In carrying out the process of this invention, conventional injection procedures are employed, i.e., the well to be treated is suitably fitted with packers, if required, and the aqueous treating agent is forced down the well bore and out into the reservoir formation by means of conventional pumping equipment if required located at the well head. For a producing well, the injection can be completed in about 1 2 to 3 days, after which the well may be immediately placed back on production. The initial well effluent following the treatment is sharply reduced in water oil ratio, and production may be continued for several weeks or months with improved oil recovery and reduced water production.Gradually, however, the water oil ratio will begin to rise again, and when the ratio reaches an undesirably high level, the well may be again shut in and the treatment repeated to again improve production. For secondary and tertiary enhanced oil recovery, a polymer slug is followed by water, in a pattern of injection wells, until a satisfactory sweep of the producing formation has been obtained. The process of this invention may be used in waterflooding injection well , tertiary recovery or a producing well, either an oil well or a gas well. The producing well may be operating under natural flow conditions, or it may be a producing well involved in a secondary recovery operation wherein a flooding medium, or gaseous driving medium is being injected into an adjacent well. It is contemplated that in such secondary recovery operations, treatment of the producing well will cause the selective diversion of reservoir waters to other wells, or to adjacent aquafer structures, thus reducing the water oil ratio in the producing well effluent. Polyampholyte Polymer It is preferred, for composition claims purposes, that the polymer have an intrinsic viscosity of 0.5 to 4.5 in 1.0 M sodium chloride, as measured in a size 75 Cannon Ubbelohde viscometer, and be prepared from 20 to 90 percent, most particularly 32.5 to 85 percent, by weight, carboxylic functional monomer 1.5 to 85 percent, particularly 5 to 65 percent, by weight, non ionic monomer and 0.5 to 40 percent, particularly 1.5 to 30 percent, by weight, cationic containing monomer. Examples Preparation of the PolymersPolymers 1 to 58 The polymers of the examples were produced by mixing the cationic, anionic and optional non ionic monomers indicated in Table I, using the amounts, solids concentration, initial temperatures and pH indicated. The monomer mix was purged with nitrogen for one hour. The solvent was deionized water. The initiator was added and the components allowed to react for about 3 hours. Polymers 31 to 37 of Table I were prepared by mixing the cationic, anionic and nonionic monomers in the ratios indicated in Table I. The solutions were then neutralized to a pH of 7.0 with 50 w v aqueous sodium hydroxide. Chain transfer agent and catalyst were added in the amounts indicated in Table I. The solutions were placed under fluorescent lights for sixty minutes.The resulting gels were diluted to 600 mg L active polymer.

An effective inhibitor will increase the charge, thus increasing the repulsive forces between particles.This will increase the dispersibility of the particles and decrease the coagulation, precipitation and subsequent scaling. The zeta potentials of magnetite iron oxide particles and of calcium carbonate and magnetite in a 70 30 weight blend were determined for 1,000 ppm suspensions in deionized water at varying pHs. 0.5 ppm and 5 ppm of various polymers were added to the suspensions and the zeta potential was remeasured.The change in the zeta potential after inhibitor addition, or zeta potential increase, is noted inTABLE VI. When the zeta potential increased, more stable suspensions were created. Mixed deposits of magnetite and calcium carbonate are particularly typical of deposits found in many gas scrubbing systems.

The silica monomer concentration was determined after 5.0 minutes by the molybdate method Alexander, C.8. J.A.C.S. 75, 5055 1953 and at subsequent time intervals. The data were analysed by use of a second order kinetic plot and the polymerization rate was determined. TABLE VII records the effects of inhibitor on the silica polymerization process. A reduction in this polymerization rate is indicative of an expected reduction in the rate of silica deposition onto heat transfer and water transport surfaces in aqueous systems.

A Haake constant temperature immersion circulator Model E 52 was used to control the solution temperature and agitate the controlled bath. The unit contained a 1000 watt fully adjustable stainless steel heater which permitted temperature control to 0.Ol0C., and a 10 liter per minute pump with a built in pressure nozzle agitator that ensured high temperature uniformity in the bath. A measured contact thermoregulator was used as the temperature sensing element. The pH of the solution was controlled with aKruger and Eckels Model 440 pH Controller. This unit was capable of turning power on and off to aDias minipump whenever the pH of the corrosive liquid environment fell below the set point. The peristaltic Dias pump, with a pumping capacity of 20 ml per hour, maintained the solution pH with the addition of sulfuric acid. Standard glass and saturated calomel electrodes were used as the sensing elements. The bath was continuously aerated at the rate of 60 cc. per minute through a medium porosity plastic gas dispersion tube to ensure air saturation. Two SAE 1010 steel coupons, each having a surface area of 4.2 square inches, were suspended by a glass hook. The solution volume to test metal surface area ratio for the test was approximately 1000 1. The composition of the synthetic water used in the test was as follows indicating content per liter of distilled water Ion Ca Mg HC03 Cl SO ppm 88 24 40 70 328The total hardness as CaCO3 was 318 ppm and the pH was 7.5. The temperature was 50 C. The test was conducted on the basis of a 2 3 day cycle the system was treated with the corrosion inhibitor compositions indicated in TABLE I. After every second or third day, the test solution was discharged and a fresh solution was prepared. At the end of a 14 day cycle, the coupons were removed and analyzed and the test was terminated. The corrosion rate of the coupons was measured by their weight loss during the 14 day cycle, and the result was calculated as mils per year mpy . The test results are summarized in TABLE VIII.

Ten grams of Bentonite clay were added to 200 cc of deionized water and sheared for 15 minutes. The 105 g of a 180 g KCl 1000 g total solution were added to the slurry and sheared for 5 minutes. For the sea water evaluation, 15 g ofBentonite clay were added to 200 cc of deionized water and sheared for 15 minutes. Then 105 g of 175 g sea salt 1000 g total sheared for 5 minutes. The sea salt used wasInstant OceanR, a product manufactured by AquariumSystems.To both mixtures, 2 g of active polymer dissolved in 50 g total solution pH adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH were added with continued shearing for 15 minutes. The viscosity of this slurry was measured on a FANN Viscometer Model 35 at 600 rpm and 300 rpm. The 30 minute fluid loss FL , in mls, was measured on a FANN Model 12 BC Filter Press under 100 psi of nitrogen.
