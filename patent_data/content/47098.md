# Adjustable attenuator circuit.

## Abstract
Partial transfer of sampled electric charges from a sampling capacitor C₁ to a charge dividing capacitor C₂ during a short time within each sampling period, and additional transfer of electric charges stored in the charge dividing capacitor C₂ to an integrating capacitor CB , or discharge thereof to the ground, according to the content of a weighting coefficient which determines an attenuation factor of the adjustable attenuator circuit. Application of such attenuator circuits to switched capacitor filters to realise adjustable filter characteristics.
