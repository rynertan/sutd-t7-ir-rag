## Description
AN OIL RESISTANT GASKET MATERIAL AND PACKING MATERIAL Background of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention relates to a room temperature vulcanizable organosiloxane elastomeric composition which is useful as an oil resistant gasket material and packing material. Description of the Prior Art Conventional oil resistant gasket materials and packing materials are in forms made from materials such as cork, asbestos paper, semimetallic material, or cork rubber. However, these gasket materials and packing materials exhibit drawbacks such as high cost, difficulty in storage management, and lack of applicability to three faceconnecting points. An adhesive, room temperature curable silicone rubber composition which is described in Japanese Patent No. Sho 46 1971 11,272, published March 22, 1971, to IchiroHashishiro and Susumu Horii, has recently been used in the auto industry, especially as gasket material and packing material in car engines however, this composition is not resistant to hot hydrocarbon oil, with the result that it suffers from oil leaks in long term usage. For this reason, it is unsatisfactory as a gasket material and packing material. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a room temperature vulcanizable organosiloxane elastomeric composition which is useful as an oil resistant gasket material and packing material, which does not exhibit the conventional drawbacks mentioned above, which is resistant to hot hydrocarbon oil, and which is curable at room temperature. The present invention relates to a room temperature vulcanizable organosiloxane elastomeric composition comprising a product obtained by mixing A 100 parts by weight of a linear polyorganosiloxane being terminated by silicon bonded hydroxyl radicals or silicon bonded organic moisture hydrolyzable radicals, having a viscosity at 250C of from 0.0001 to 0.1 m2 s, the organic radicals being a monovalent radical selected from the group consisting of monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, halogenated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and cyanoalkyl radicals, at least 0.5 percent of the total number of organic radicals being alkenyl radicals on the average, B 5 to 300 parts by weight filler, C 0.2 to 10 parts by weight of a silane or pclysiloxane in which there is present in each molecule at least one aminoalkyl radical bonded to a silicon atom through a silicon carbon bond and in which there is present in each molecule at least one silicon bonded alkoxy radical or aminoalkoxy radical, D an amount sufficient to make a mixture of A , B , and C curable at room temperature of a silicon compound having in each molecule at least three silicon bonded organic moisture hydrolyzable radicals,. and E optionally, a catalytic quantity of a curingacceleration catalyst. Description of the Invention The linear polyorganosiloxane of component A is an essentially linear, that is, linear or slightly branched chain structure and its terminations are hydroxyl radicals or organic moisture hydrolyzable radicals bonded to a silicon atom. Although the number of hydroxyl radicals or hydrolyzable radicals bonded to the same silicon atom is 1, 2 or 3, and at least 2 should be contained in one molecule of the polyorganosiloxane. The hydrolyzable radicals are those conventionally used in room temperature vulcanizable organosiloxane elastomeric compositions and include alkoxy radicals, acyloxy radicals, ketoxime radicals, N substituted amino radicals, N substituted amide radicals, andN substituted aminoxy radicals, however, it is not limited to these radicals. In A , at least 0.5 of the organic groups bonded to silicon atoms are alkenyl radicals on the average. When the number of alkenyl radicals is less than 0.5 , the composition is not resistant to hot hydrocarbon oil. The number of alkenyl radicals being 05 on the average means that .qhen A is a single polymer 0,5 of the total organic radicals bonded to silicon atoms in each molecule are alkenyl radicals on the other hand, when A is a mixture of polymers, such as a mixture which contains polymers possessing alkenyl radicals bonded to silicon atoms, and polymers which do not possess alkenyl radicals bonded to silicon atoms, 0.5 of the total number of organic radicals bonded to silicon atoms of all polymers in the mixture are alkenyl radicals.Examples of the alkenyl radicals are vinyl radicals, allyl radicals and 2 butenyl radicals. r lle preferred alkenyl radical is vinyl. Although the upper limit for the number of alkenyl radicals in A is 100 , preparation of such polymers for industrial purposes is not practical and therefore a practical amount of alkenyl radicals is from 0.5 to 50 of the organic radicals. The preferred range of alkenyl radicals is from 0.5 to 25 of the organic radicals. The organic radicals bonded to silicon atoms in A can be monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, halogenated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and cyanoalkyl radicals. Examples of organic radicals bonded to silicon atoms, other than alkenyl radicals, are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals such as alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, hexyl, and octadecyl radicals, cycloalkyl radicals such as cyclohexyl and cyclopentyl radicals, alkaryl radicals such as benzyl and ss phenylethyl radicals, aryl radicals such as phenyl, 4biphenylyl, naphthyl, tolyl, and xylyl radicals the halogenated derivatives of the monovalent hydrocarbon radicals and cyanoalkyl radicals such as 3 cyanoethyl, y cyanopropyl, and ss cyanobutyl radicals. One molecule can contain one or more different radicals.Preferred organic radicals, other than alkenyl, are methyl, phenyl, and 3,3 , 3 trifluoropropyl. The preferred siloxane units which constitute the principal chain of A include dimethylsiloxane, methylvinylsiloxane, methylphenylsiloxane, methyl 3,3, 3 tri fluoropropyl siloxane, and diphenylsiloxane. The viscosity range of A at 250C should be 0.C001 to 0.1 m2 s on the average. 0.0001 to 0.1 m s on the average means that A can be a polymer with a viscosity in the range of 0.0001 to 0.1 m2 s or a mixture of polymers which has an average viscosity in the range of 0.0001 to 0.1 m2 s. The viscosity of each polymer can be less than 0.0001 m2 s or can exceed 0.1 m Xs as long as the above mentioned specification is satisfied. Component A preferably has a viscosity in the range from 0.0005 to 0.02 m2 s. The filler, component B , can maintain the viscosity and fluidity of the composition of this invention in a range appropriate for a gasket material and a packing material and can also be used to generate mechanical properties in the cured rubber. The filler can be inorganic or organic.However, it is preferably inorganic from the standpoint of oil resistance. A typical inorganic filler is silica filler. A silica filler can be reinforcing silica filler or non reinforcing silica filler. Reinforcing silica fillers include fumed silica, precipitated silica, fumed or precipitated silica which has been converted into a hydrophobic material by coating with hexamethyldisilazane or trimethylchlorosilane, silica aerogel, and silica zerogel. Non reinforcing silica fillers include crushed or pulverized quartz, diatomaceous earth and similar compounds. Fumed silica is preferred from the standpoint of fluidity and rubber properties after curing, and its specific surface area should be in the range of 130 to 300 m2 g. Other inorganic fillers include calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, aluminum hydroxide, iron oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, finely pulverized mica, and carbon black. The quantity of B to be added is 5 to 300 parts by weight and can be varied to achieve desired viscosity and fluidity of the composition and mechanical properties of the cured rubber. The preferred quantity of reinforcing silica filler or carbon black is 5 to 30 parts by weight and the preferred quantity of non reinforcing silica filler or other fillers is 15 to 200 parts by weight. Component B can be a single filler mentioned above or a mixture of two or more of these fillers. Component C is an organosilane or organosiloxane in which one molecule possesses at least one aminoalkyl radical and at least one silicon atom bonded alkoxyl radical or aminoalkoxy radical. Component C exhibits a multiplicative effect with the alkenyl radical of component A by increasing the resistance to hot hydrocarbon oil and by increasing the adhesive strength of the cure elastomer to substrates. The alkoxy radicals include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, and methoxyethoxy, preferrably containing from one to six carbon atoms per radical. The aminoalkoxy radicals include OCH2CH2NH2.Examples of C are y aminopropyltriethoxysilane of the formula H2N CH2 3Si OC2H5 3 y aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane of the formula H2N CH2 3Si CH3 2 OC2H5 , N trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenediamine of the formulaH2N CH2 2NH CH2 3Si oCH3 3,N dimethoxymethylsilylpropyl ethylenediamine of the formula H2N CH2 2NH CH2 3SiCH3 OCH3 2, 6 aminobutyl methyl diethoxysilane of the formula H2N CH2 4Si CH3 OC2H5 2, N,N bis y propyltriethoxysilyl ethylenediamine of the formula CH3O 3Si CH2 3HNCH2CH2NH CH2 3Si OCH3 3, gamma aminopropyltri ss methoxyethoxy silane of the formula H2N CH2 3Si OCH2CH2OCH3 3, organosilane of the formula H2NCH2CH2O CH2 3Si OC2E5 3, organosilane of the formula H2NCH2CH2O CH2 3Si OCHzCH2NH 3, organosiloxane of the formulaEMI5.1 organosiloxane of the formulaEMI6.1 condensation products of partially hydrolyzed y aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and condensation products of partially hydrolyzed organosilane of the formula H2NCH2CH2o CH2 3Si oC2H5 3 Component C is preferably aminoalkyltrialkoxysilanes andN trialkoxysilylalkyl alkylenediamine. The quantity of C is 0.2 to 10 parts by weight. When this quantity is less than 0.2 part by weight, the composition does not exhibit satisfactory oil resistance and adhesive properties. On the other hand, when this quantity exceeds 10 parts by weight, the composition does not exhibit satisfactory heat resistance. The preferred quantity of C is from 0.3 to 6 parts by weight. Component D can be a silicon compound which has at least three silicon bonded organic moisture hydrolyzable radicals, such as silanes and siloxanes. Examples of these silanes or siloxanes are alkoxysilanes such as tetraethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, 3,3, 3 trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane, ss cyanoethyltrimethoxysilane, tetraisopropxysilane, tetrabutoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, octadecyltrimethoxysilane, tetra B chloroethoxy silane, tetra 2,2,2 trifluoroethoxy silane, propyltris 6 chlorobutoxy silane, and methyltris methoxyethoxy silane alkoxysiloxanes such ethylpolysilicate and dimethyltetramethoxydisiloxane vinyloxysilanes such as methyltri a methylvinyloxy silane and vinyltri a methylvinyloxy silane acyloxysilanes such as methyltris acetoxy silane, vinyltris acetoxy silane, and phenyltris acetoxy silane ketoximesilanes such as methyltris methylethylketoxime silane, vinyltris methylethylketoxime silane, phenyltris methylethylketoxime silane, methyl diethylketoxime silane N substituted aminosilanes such as metbyltris cyclohexylamino silane and vinyltris normal butylamino silane N substituted amidosilanes such as methyltris N methylacetamido silane, methyltris N butylacetamido silane, and methyltris N cyclohexylacetamido silane, N substituted aminoxysilanes such as methyltris N,N diethylaminoxy silane and N substituted aminoxysiloxanes such asEMI7.1 Preferably, D is an alkoxysilane, alkoxysiloxane, vinyloxysilane, ketoxime silane, N substituted aminosilane, an N substituted aminoxysilane, or N substituted aminoxysiloxane. The quantity of D can be appropriately determined by considering whether a gasket material or packing material is a one or two package type, and whether the terminal silicon atom bonded radical of A is a hydroxyl radical or a hydrolyzable radical, and b considering the terminal silicon atom bonded radical concentration of A . In an extreme case, when the terminal silicon atom bonded radicals are hydrolyzable radicals whose number is at least 3 in one molecule of A , the quantity of silane or siloxane, D , can be 0. If a composition of components A , B , and C is curable at room temperature in the absence of D , the phrase an amount sufficient to make a mixture of A , B , and C curable at room temperature specified in the claims can mean 0.The terminal silicon atom bonded hydrolyzable radical of A is desirably identical to the hydrolyzable rlclical of componcnt D . One package compositions which are stored in containers sealed from moisture and curable at room temperature upon exposure to moisture can be made from A , B , and C in which A has at least three hydrolyzable radicals per molecule. Such one package compositions can also contain a quantity of D , such as up to 10 parts by weight or more.One package compositions can also be made by mixing A , B , C , and D wherein A is hydroxyl terminated. Here, the quantity of D should be sufficient enough to provide at least one mole of D molecules for each mole of hydroxyl radical in A . Two package compositions are those wherein A containing hydroxyl termination and B is packaged in one container and C and D is packaged in another container.In this situation, the moles of alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, and aminoalkoxy plus the moles of hydrolyzable radical in D are approximately equivalent to the moles of hydroxyl radical in A . When the contents of the two packages are mixed, the resulting composition cures at room temperature to an elastomer. The illustrations of one package and two package compositions are to exemplify the nature of the two forms most often found in the silicone rubber art. The practitioner in the silicone rubber art will recognize other variations of one package and two package compositions suitable for the presently defined compositions. Component E is a catalyst for accelerating the cure of the composition at room temperature. Component E is optional to the extent that some of the variations of the composition do not require a catalyst for curing at room temperature. A catalyst can be used if desired or is required for room temperature cure. The necessity of this catalyst depends on the types of terminal silicon atom bonded hydrolyzable radicals of component A and the hydrolyzable radicals of component D . This catalyst is not needed for certain types of hydrolyzable radicals but is indispensable for other types of hydrolyzable radicals. If a composition of A , B , and C or a composition of A , B , C , and D is curable at room temperature in the absence of this catalyst, the phrase a catalytic quantity of a curing acceleration catalyst specified in the claims can be 0.The type of catalyst used depends on the type of hydrolyzable radical group mentioned above, and it should be appropriately selected. Typical examples of E are metal salts of monocarboxylic acids such as dialkyltin diacylates such as dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyitin 2 ethylbexoate, and dibutyltin dilaurate, and other salts such as lead 2 ethyloctoate, butyltin tri 2 ethylhexoate, iron 2 ethylhexoate, cobalt 2 ethylhexoate, manganese 2 ethylhexoate, tin II caprilate, tin naphthenate, tin oleate, tin butyrate, zinc naphthenate, zinc stearate, and titanium naphthenate organic titanates such as tetrabutyl titanate, tetraphenyl titanate, tetra 2 ethylhexyl titanate, tetraoctadecyl titanate, triethanolamine titanate, ethylene glycol titanate, organosiloxytitanium compounds in which an organosiloxy group is bonded to a titanium atom in the form of Si O Ti refer to U.S. Patent No. 3,294,739, issued toWeyenberg , and B dicarbonyltitanium compounds refer toU.S.Patent No. 3,334,067, issued to Weyenberg of the general formulaEMI9.1 in which R1 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 18 inclusive carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 18 inclusive carbon atoms, R3 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or an aliphatic hydrocarbonoxy radical each having from 1 to 18 inclusive carbon atoms, Z is an aliphatic hydrocarbonoxy radical having from 1 to 18 inclusive carbon atoms, an acyloxy radical having from 1 to 18 inclusive carbon atoms , hydroxyl radical, and divalent oxygen atoms forming a TiOTi linkage and amines such as hexylamine and dodecylamine amine salts such as hexylamine acetate and dodecylamine phosphate quaternary ammonium salts such as benzyltrimethylammonium acetate, and alkali metal salts such as potassium acetate.The preferred quantity of E is 0.1 to 6 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of component A when catalyst is required. The composition of this invention can be produced simply by blending the above mentioned components such as A , B , and C or A , B , C , and E or A , B , C , and D , or A , B , C , D , and E . If necessary, hydrophobic treating agents such as diphenylsilane diol and hexamethyldisilazane, for hydrophilic sildca filler can be used. Also heat resistant agents such as cerium oxide, cerium hydroxide, or fumed titanium dioxide various pigments flame retardants such as platinum, manganese carbonate, or azoisobutyronitrile and oil resistance improving agents such as zinc borate, all of which are traditionally added to room temperature curable silicone rubber, can also be added to the composition produced by the method of this invention.Oil resistant gasket material and packing material produced from the compositions of this invention can be cured at room temperature to become an elastomer which adheres to the substrates during the curing process. Because the elastomer obtained from the composition of this invention are very resistant to hot hydrocarbon oil, they are useful as gasket material and packing material for an auto engine oil pan, marine diesel engine headcover, auto transmission pan or rotary engine. The best room temperature vulcanizable organosiloxane elastomeric compositions comprise a product obtained by mixing A 100 parts by weight of a linear hydroxyl endblocked polyorganosiloxane in which the silicon bonded organic radicals are methyl and vinyl, 0.5 to 25 on the average of the said organic radicals are vinyl, and the viscosity at 250C is in the range of from 0.0005 to 0.02 m2 s, B 5 to 30 parts by weight of reinforcing silica filler, C 0.3 to 6 parts by weight of gamma aminopropyltrialkoxysilane or N trlalkoxysilylpropylethylenediamine, and D an amount of an organotri ketoxime silane sufficient to make a mixture of A , B , and C curable at room temperature upon exposure to moisture and storable in a package which protects the composition from moisture intrusion, and E a catalytic quantity of diorganotin diacylate. This invention will be further explained by using demonstrative examples which should not be construed as limiting the invention which is defined by the claims. In the examples, parts means parts by weight and the viscosity it the measured value. at 25 C. Example 1 Mixtures were prepared by blending 100 parts of a hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane containing dimethylsiloxane units and methylvinylsiloxane units i Ild 2 having a viscosity of 0.015 m2 s with 8 parts of phenyltriethoxysilane, 12 parts of fumed silica having a specific surface area of 130 m2 g, one part of gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and 0.5 part of dibutyltin dilaurate.For each composition in Table I, the amount of methylvinylsiloxane unit is sufficient to provide the vinyl content indicated in Table I as a percentage of the total number of methyl and vinyl radicals in the polydiorganosiloxane. The resulting mixture was defoamed and then packaged in aluminum foil tubes which were sealed to prevent exposure to moisture. This mixture did not undergo any change in quality after storing at room temperature for 6 months. The mixture was then extruded from the aluminum foil tube and cured at room temperature for 2 days to obtain a 2 mn thick sheet. This sheet was immersed in lubricating oil num 3 shown inJIS K 6301 at 150 C for 3 days. The kinetic viscosity of this oil is in the range of 0.00003196 to 0.00003418 m2 s at 37.80C. The change in hardness was measured and the results are reported in Table I. For comparison, a sheet was manufactured by a method identical to that of Example 1 with the exception that hydroxyl endblocked polydimethylsiloxane, was used in place of the vinyl containing polydiorganosiloxane. These results are also reported in Table I as comparison Example No. 5. These results demonstrated that the composition of vinyl containing polysiloxane was very resistant to hot hydrocarbon oil.Example 2 Mixtures were prepared by blending 100 parts of a polysiloxane mixture having an average viscosity of 0.005 2 m s and an average vinyl radical content of 1.1 based on the total number of organic groups in the polysiloxane mixture with 5 parts of fumed silica having a specific surface area of 200 m2 g, 50 parts of diatomaceous earth powder, 8 parts of vinyltris methylethylketoxime silane, and the quantity of N trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenediamine as shown in Table II.The polysiloxane mixture was a blend of 90 parts of a hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane containing 90 mol dimethylsiloxane units and 10 mol 2 diphenylsiloxane units and having a viscosity of 0.012 m and 10 parts of a hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane containing 90 mol of dimethylsiloxane units and 10 mol methylvinylsiloxane units and having a viscosity of 0.00001 2 m Is. The resulting mixture was defoamed and cured at room temperature for 7 days to obtain a sheet. The hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break of the above mentioned sheet were measured by the methods ofJIS K 6301. To examine the relative resistance to hot hydrocarbon oil, the hardness, tensile strength and elongation at the break of the above mentioned sheet were measured after the sheet had been immersed in 10W 30 motor oil at 1500C for 14 days. These results are reported in Table II. The above mentioned composition was made into a sheet 1 mm thick with a contact area of 25 mm x 25 mm and was inserted between 2 sheets of cold rolled stainless steel plate length 100 mm width 25 mm thickness 1 mm and cured at room temperature for 7 days. The tensile shear adhesive strength of the composite was then measured. The tensile shear adhesive strength of the composite which had been immersed in 10W 30 motor oil at 1200C for 10 days was also measured. The results are reported in Table II.Table II demonstrates that N trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenediamine in combination with vinyl containing polyorganosiloxanes exhibited a significant increase in resistance to hot hydrocarbon oil and in adhesive properties.Example 3 A mixture was prepared by combining 100 parts of a methyldimethoxysiloxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxane containing dimethylsiloxane units and methylvinylsiloxane and having a viscosity of 0,02 m2 s with 30 parts of fumed 2 silica having a specific surface area of 200 m s and having been treated with hexamethyldisilazane. The vinyl content of the polydiorganosiloxane is 5 based on the total number of methyl and vinyl radicals in the polydiorganosiloxane.The resulting mixture was heated at 1500C for 2 hours.After the mixture cooled, it was mixed with 1 part of gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 8 parts of methyltrimethoxysilane and 0.5 part of bis acetylacetonyl diisopropyl titanate. The above mentioned composition was stored in a moisture impermeable container for 3 months without hardening. After 3 months the composition was extruded from the container and allowed to cure at room temperature for 72 hours. The resistance of this composition to hot hydrocarbon oil was examined by the method identical to that of Example 1. The results are reported in Table III. For comparison, the experiment was carried out by the method identical to that mentioned above with the exception that methyldimethoxysiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane, replaced the vinyl containing polydiorganosiloxane. The results are also reported in Table III.Example 4 Silicone rubber sheets were manufactured by the method identical to that of Example 2 with the exceptions that one of the methyltriacetoxysilane, methyltris normal butyl aminoj silane, and methyltris N,N diethylaminoxy silane was used instead of vinyltris methylethylketoxime silane and in the same amount, and 2 parts of organopolysiloxane with the formula ofEMI14.1 was used instead of N trimethoxysilylpropyl thylene diamine. Resistance to hot hydrocarbon oil was examined by the method of Example 1. The results showed that the change in hardness was 15 in every case, which indicated excellent oil resistance.
