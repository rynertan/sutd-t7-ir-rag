An automatic tool changing system for machine tools wherein a tool magazine is arranged at least on one side of a table of a machine tool so as to be rotatable in either of forward and backward directions, whereby said table is moved and said tool magazine is rotated such that the center of selected one of a plurality of tool receptacles of said tool magazine or the center of a tool holder received in said one tool receptacle is aligned with the center of a spindle of said machine tool thereby changing tools.

## Description
AUTOMATIC TOOL CHANGING SYSTEM FORMACHINE TOOLS The present invention relates to an automatic tool changing system for machine tools such as NC milling machines equipped for example with automatic tool changers hereinafter referred to as machining centers . Many different types of automatic tool changing systems hereinafter referred to as ATC systems for vertical machining centers have been practiced and these systems are mostly such that as shown in Fig. 1, a tool magazine 3 is arranged in the upper part of the machining center or on each side or on one side of a frame 1 and a tool holder 4 is engaged with a spindle 2 by means of an arm. Alternatively, the tool holder is engaged with the spindle directly from the tool magazine. With these known ATC systems, the weight of the tool magazine 3 is applied directly to the frame 1 and thus the accuracy of the frame 1 tends. to be deteriorated with the resulting deterioration in the machining accuracy of a work.Another disadvantage is that the tool magazine is arranged high to face downwardly or obliquely so that the operator is fatigued with the operation of engaging and disengaging the large number of tool holders 4 with the tool magazine 3 and the operation also involves danger to the operator. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved automatic tool changing system for machine tools which overcomes the foregoing deficiencies of the prior art ATC systems and which is capable of quickly and safely effecting the tool change without any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the frame. To accomplish the above object, in accordance with the invention there is provided an improved ATC system for a machine tool in which a tool magazine is arranged on each side or on one side of the table of the machine tool, whereby while moving the table the tool magazine is rotated in such a manner that any tool receptacle or a new tool is positioned just below the spindle by fast feed and then the spindle is lowered, thereby disengaging the used tool with the spindle and reaccommodating it in the tool magazine and engaging the new tool with the spindle. Fig. 1 is a front view of an exemplary prior art machining center. Fig. 2 is a front view of a machining center incorporating an ATC system according to the present invention. Fig. 3 is a plan view showing an embodiment of a table and tool magazines according to the ATC system of this invention. Fig. 4 is a front view of Fig. 3. Figs. 5 and 6 are front views showing principal parts of the system, which are useful for explaining the tool changing operation according to the invention. Referring to Fig. 2 showing an embodiment of the system of this invention, tool magazines 8 and 9 are provided on the sides of a table 5 or one of the tool magazines is provided on one side in the illustrated case the tool magazines 8 and 9 are arranged on the sides of the table 5 . More specifically, in the embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4, numeral 5 designates a table of a machining center, and 8 and 9 diskshaped tool magazines respectively mounted on bases 6 and 7 which are arranged on the sides of the table 5. The tool magazines 8 and 9 are respectively provided with large numbers of tool receptacles 10 and 11 arranged at equal spaces and tools 12b and 12c, each mounted on a tool holder 13, are respectively received in the tool receptacles 10 and 11.The tool magazines 8 and 9 are each provided with a mechanism e.g., a Geneva stop or a stop mechanism employing a pulse counter so that they are rotated clockwise or counterclockwise for indexing and are respectively stopped at points A and B. Numerals 15 and 16 designate covers for the tool magazines 8 and 9, respectively, which are adapted to be opened and closed automatically. Numeral 2 designates a spindle supported by a frame 1 and adapted for vertical movement along the frame 1. Numeral 17 designates a work fixed in place on the table 5. With the ATC system of this invention arranged as described above, its operation will now be described by way of example with reference to a case where a tool 12a hereinafter referred to as a used tool which is in engagement with the spindle 2 is returned to the tool magazine 8 and changed with another tool 12b hereinafter referred to as a new tool in reference to Fig. 5. Firstly, the spindle 2 is raised to separate it from the work 17 and the table 5 is moved in the direction of an arrow a.Also the tool magazine 8 is rotated in such a manner that any receptacle holding no tool 12 e.g., 10a is brought to a position below the spindle 2 or a point A and then, if necessary, the table 5 is subjected to fine adjustments in the X and Y directions so as to position the table 5 and thereby to align the center of the receptacle lOa with the center of the spindle 2. Then, the spindle 2 is lowered so that the used tool 12a engaging with the spindle 12 is transferred to the receptacle lOa of the tool magazine 8 and the spindle 2 is raised again. Then, the tool magazine 8 is rotated so that the tool holder e.g. 13b holding the new tool 12b is positioned below the spindle 2 and the table 5 is positioned in place.Thereafter, the spindle 2 is lowered to engage the new tool 12b with the spindle 2 and then the spindle 2 is raised again. Then, the table 5 is moved in the direction of an arrow b until the work 17 is positioned below the spindle 2 and after the table 5 has been positioned the spindle 2 is lowered thus machining the work 17. To change the tools of the tool magazine 9 on the right side of the table 5, it is only necessary to move the table 5 in the direction of the arrow b as shown in Fig. 6 and change the tools in the same manner as mentioned previously. It is to be noted that each of the tool magazines 8 and 9 can be rotated either counterclockwise or clockwise for accommodating the used tool and engaging a new tool and therefore the tool changing time can be reduced by rotating the tool magazine 8 or 9 in a direction which is a short cut to the point A or B. In accordance with this embodiment, about 15 seconds were required for raising and separating the spindle 2 from the work 17, movoing the table 5 and rotating the tool magazine 8, returning the used tool 12a to the tool magazine 8 and raising the spindle 2, rotating the tool magazine 8 again and engaging the new tool 12b with the spindle 2 and then starting again the machining by the new tool 12b. From the foregoing description it will be apparent that the present invention has the following remarkable advantages 1 The arrangement of a tool magazine on each side or on one side of the table prevents any detrimental effect on the frame and thus stabilizes the accuracy of machining. 2 Since the tool magazine or magazines are arranged in the lower part of the machining center to look upward, the operation of accommodating the tools in the tool magazines is easy and safe. 3 Since the tools are contained inside the tool magazines and not exposed to the outside, a very high degree of safety is ensured. 4 Since the tool magazines are positioned low, the conditions of the tools can be observed under one s eyes. 5 Since the tool changing position or positions are fixed, there is no need to move the table for each of the tools and this prevents any wasteful movements. 6 The required tool selecting program can be simplified. 7 The arms for transferring the tool holders to the spindle and so on are eliminated with the resulting decrease in the tool changing time.
