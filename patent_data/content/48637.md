# Method of reflex thermomagnetic recording.

## Abstract
Method of developing latent magnetic images obtained by reflex thermomagnetic recording. A reflex imaging mem ber is magnetized and a latent magnetic image formed thereon by thermoremanent exposure. The imaging member is developed by contacting it with magnetizable toner particles which have been subjected to a high intensity magnetizing field such that the toner particles retain a residual internal magnetic field after removal of the magne tizing field.
