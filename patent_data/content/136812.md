# REAGENTS FOR ENHANCING THE CONTRAST IN NMR IMAGES

## Abstract
Reagents for enhancing the contrast of nuclear magnetic images of biological tissues. By contacting the tissues to be imaged with a complex comprising a macromolecule attached to a paramagnetic ion, wherein the macromolecule is tissue specific and the complex has a correlation time of reorientation or a correlation time of rotation of ligands comparable to the Larmor period, the target atom proton relaxation rates are altered and the contrast in the images produced by conventional nuclear magnetic resonance tech niques is enhanced.
