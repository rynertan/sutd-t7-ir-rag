## Description
MYOPIA ALLEVIATION PROSTHESIS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the field of medicine and particularly to prostheses for improving the vision of myopic patients. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A patient with normal vision is able to appropriately change the shape of the natural lens so as to focus an image upon the retina, and particularly upon the retinal macula. Myopic persons are unable to focus upon distant objects because the image thereof is formed a short distance often measured in fractions of a millimeter in front of the macula. There are various causes of myopia, among which may be listed the failure of the natural lens to change shape sufficiently, abnormal corneal curvature, and an abnormally long eye globe measured in the direction of the optical axis. Eyeglasses commonly are employed to correct myopia of not greater than several diopters. Contact lenses can be used to correct myopia to the extent of perhaps twenty diopters. A surgical procedure known as a radial keratotomy has been employed in recent years to at least partially correct myopia, the procedure involving making radial, partial thickness incisions in the cornea for the purpose of slightly flattening the cornea. Another surgical procedure, keratomilieusis, involves removal of a partial thickness corneal button, freezing and grinding the innerside of the button to produce increased or decreased concavity, and then reattaching the corneal button, this procedure also tending to flatten the cornea.The surgical procedures thus described depend greatly upon the technical expertise and manual dexterity of the surgeon, and may in some cases lead to scarring of the cornea or to unintentional invasion of the anterior chamber with the consequent danger of infection.Further, a great deal of judgment must be used with respect to the depth, placement and number of radial incisions in the radial keratotomy procedure and in the degree of tissue removal in the keratomilieusis autograft procedure, and perfect results are seldom obtained. Trauma to the eye in the vicinity of the limbus, of course, may result in the onset of glaucoma. The prostheses and surgical routines referred to above each have, as their object, a refractive correction anterior to the natural lens. In the conditions known as progressive axial myopia and posterior staphyloma, the enlargement of the scleral and uveal coats of the eye results in stretching, thinning and deterioration of the retinal nerve tissue, which by its nature cannot grow. The interocular pressure in the globe itself tends to cause the globe to bulge out rearwardly. This, in turn, may cause structural changes in the retina leading to optically uncorrectible decreases in vision.In an effort to support the rearward portion of the globe against further distension and traction on the retina, scleral reinforcement techniques have been developed in which a band of scleral tissue is passed about the posterior portion of the globe to strengthen the globe. This procedure is particularly well reported in Frank B. Thompson, A Simplified Scleral Reinforcement Technique, AM. J. Opthalmol 86 782 790, 1978. In the reported procedure, a band of scleral tissue terminating in corneal portions and taken from a donor eye was passed posteriorly about the globe of an eye, the corneal end portions being sutured to the globe anteriorly of its equator.Although such slings by themselves may occasionally reduce an ectatic posterior staphyloma, the rearward portion of the globe is at best strengthened to prevent further distension and to limit the progression of posterior enlargement of the globe, BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a prostheses for myopic eyes and comprises an elongated strip of flexible, and desirably longitudinally elastic or substantially inextensible, material, the length of which may range from about 50 to about 75mm. Intermediate its length, a pressure pad is provided along its inner surface, the pad being flexible but being desirably substantially incompressible through its thickness.In use, the prosthesis is passed posteriorly of the eye globe with the pressure pad in contact with the globe on the obverse side of the eye wall from the macula, and the ends of the strip are sutured to the sclera anteriorly of the equator of the globe. The pressure pad, pressing inwardly upon the posterior portion of the eye wall obverse to the macula, applies sufficient force anteriorly to the globe parallel to the optical axis of the eye so as to force the macula axially inwardly, e.g., the rearward wall of the globe is indented slightly toward the cornea of the eye, thereby shortening the distance between the macula and cornea to improve the formation of an image on the macula and reduce traction on retinal elements as may be desired.Since the macula need be moved axially inwardly of the globe toward the cornea only a very short distance, comnonly measured in fractions of a millimeter for many cases of myopia, the thickness of the pressure pad, the tension in the strip, or both may be varied so that when the prosthesis is in place, the macula is correctly spaced from the cornea. In this manner, a variably controlled indentation of the posterior ocular segment can be accomplished to reduce the axial length of the globe, thereby correcting mild to severe myopia and, as may be desired, reducing traction on retainal elements to prevent structural damage resulting in permanent optical uncorrectable decreases in vision. Accordingly, the invention, in one embodiment, involves positioning a prosthesis of the invention behind the globe with the pressure pad bearing anteriorly against the obverse side of the eye wall from the macula to force the latter anteriorly to improve the formation of an image on the macula. Since the macula is spaced only a short distance about 5mm. from the optic nerve, and since pressure against the optic nerve should be avoided, the pressure pad of the invention preferably has a recessed edge to accommodate free passage of the optic nerve. If desired, the thickness of the pressure pad may be externally adjusted after positioning of the prosthesis so as to permit adjustment of the axial position of the macula. Hence, another embodiment of the invention involves a method of positioning behind the globe a prosthesis of the invention having a pressure pad, the thickness of which is externally adjustable, and thereafter adjusting the thickness of the pressure pad so as to appropriately axially position the macula so that images from distant objects are focused upon the macula. The prosthesis in one embodiment may include a pad comprising an inflatable reservoir, and inflation means, typically a thin tube, leading from the reservoir to permit external inflation thereof after surgical positioning of the prosthesis.The reservoir may be inflated with any appropriate fluid such as saline or, preferably, a hardenable polymeric substance. If a non hardenable fluid such as saline or air is employed, then means must be provided for maintaining the fluid within the reservoir. If a hardenable, normally polymeric substance is employed, then, upon hardening of the substance, the inflation tube may be removed from the device. In another embodiment, the pressure pad may include an internally threaded annular washer having therewithin an exteriorly threaded shaft, the shaft bearing magnetic means enabling exterior rotation thereof. The shaft may be provided with a bar magnet across its width, and rotation of the shaft within the washer may be affected by providing a strong magnet exterior and desirably, anterior to the eye and rotating the magnet about the optical axis of the eye.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring first to Figures 3 and 8 11, proper understanding of the invention can be aided by first identifying the relevant eye structure. The globe of an eye is shown gnerally as G and includes, anteriorly, a cornea C . Movement of the eye is governed by the operation of six eye muscles of which the medical and lateral rectus muscles are designated Med. R. and Lat. R. . The superior and inferior rectus muscles are designated Sup. R. and Inf. R. . The superior and inferior oblique muscles are designated Sup. Obl. and Inf. Obl. . The optic nerve is designated 0 , and, as is shown in Figure 9, inserts into the globe medially of the optic axis O.A. .With reference to Figure 11, which is simplified for purposes of this disclosure, the sclera at the posterior portion of the eye wall is designated S and the retina, including its uveal layer, as R . The macula, which is centered on the optical axis, is shown as M , and is shown in phantom lines also in Figure 9. Referring now to the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, the device of the invention is shown generally as 1 and comprises an elongated strip 12 having a length in the range of from about 50 to about 75mm.The strip may be of any physiologically acceptable material such as donor scleral tissue or other tissue, woven polyester, silicone or siliconized fabric, and silk. The strip is flexible so as to closely conform to the outer surface of the globe of an eye. In one embodiment, the strip is inextensible in another embodiment, the strip may be longitudinally elastically extensible. Particularly the end portions 14 of the strip are desirably suturable that is, they are strong and tear or split resistant so as to accept and retain sutures when the device is implanted in an eye. The strip 12 desirably is not greater than about l.Omm.in thickness, and the longitudinal edges of the strip 12 desirably are gently rounded or are soft or nonabrasive so as to avoid unintentional irritation or damage to the eye. A pressure pad is designated 16 and is sewn, cemented or otherwise affixed to the strip 12 intermediate the length of the strip. The pressure pad may be of any useful size and shape, Edges of the pad desirably are gently rounded and soft or otherwise nonabrasive. In one embodiment, the pad 16 may be substantially incompressible in its thickness direction, although the pad may be otherwise as flexible as desired. The term substantially incompressible means that the pad, when urged anteriorly against the rearward eye wall segment, will preferentially indent the eye wall rather than mainly absorb anterior pressure through compression. Some compressability, of course, may be permitted. Since, when the device 10 is surgically positioned, the pad 16 comes into fairly close proximity with the optic nerve, the pad may be recessed along one edge as shown at 18 in Figure 1 to accommodate passage of the nerve. The pad may be so affixed to the strip as to permit adjustment of the pad along the strip to a desired position. For example, the strip may pass slideably through loops or a channel carried by the pad. Preferably, however, the pad is nonmoveably attached to the strip. As described more fully below, the surgical positioning procedure involves passing the strip 12 posteriorly about the globe of an eye and then fastening, as by sutures, the ends 14 of the strip to the sclera anteriorly of the equator of the eye and adjacent but spaced from the limbus. In this manner, the pad 16 is positioned directly behind the macula, and the forward axial pressure that is placed on the pad when. the ends 14 of the strip are sutured tautly to the sclera causes the pad to push axially inwardly upon the eye wall, resulting in a slight but measurable anterior displacement, i.e., indentation, of the macula along the optical axis.The degree to which the macula may be displaced anteriorly will depend upon the tautness of the strip 12 and the thickness of the pad 16 since the tautness of the strip is limited by practical considerations involving the strength of the sutures and sutured scleral tissue, the anterior axial displacement of the macula depends largely upon the thickness of the pad 16 . In the embodiment thus described, different degrees of desired visual correction will be afforded through the use of pads having different, predetermined thicknesses and the amount of anterior pressure imparted to the pads. As shown in Figure 11, when the device of the invention is properly positioned, the pad causes axial deformation or indentation of the posterior portion of the eye wall obverse to the macula, and also may deform the strip 12 at the site of the pad 16 .The correlation between pad thickness and optical correction due to anterior displacement of the macula assumes that the tension in the strip 12 and its deformation due to the presence of the pad 16 can be largely controlled. The axial displacement of the macula from the cornea may be determined with precision within about 0.lmm. by known ultrasound techniques at the time of surgery. The ease of indenting the globe wall may be improved by utilizing an anterior chamber tap to release aqueous humor and thus control intraocular pressure as sutures holding the strip are drawn taut during surgery. If intraocular pressure is initially reduced, then, since the intraocular pressure will ordinarily be restored by the eye, it may be desirable to displace the macula axially forwardly a distance slightly greater than needed to correct vision since the macula will be displaced rearwardly slightly as intraocular pressure is rebuilt. As mentioned above, the compressibility of the pad 16 in its thickness direction desirably is relatively slight and substantially less than the compressibility or deformability of the eye wall at its posterior surface obverse to the macula. That is, variations in pad thickness desirably are directly reflected in changes in the anterior displacement of the macula. Figures 3 and 4 show the use of a strip 12 that is cut from a donor eye. Scleral tissue commonly is a somewhat fibrous tissue with the fibrous orientation running from the anterior to the posterior regions of the eye hence, sutures that are placed in scleral tissue and that are subject to forces parallel to the fibrous orientation may cause the sclera to split or yield parallel to its fibers. Also, the strip 12 should be sufficiently long, as discussed above, as to extend from the pad 16 anteriorly about the globe of the eye for fixation to the sclera of the host eye at a point anterior to the equator of the eye and adjacent but spaced from the limbus. For these reasons, a strip of corneo scleral material may be cut from a donor eye as shown in Figure 3, the ends of the strip including portions of corneal tissue.The corneal tissue is comparatively strong and tear resistant, and can be readily sutured to the sclera of the host eye. The strip of eye tissue commonly will be approximately 50 75mm. in length and desirably about 8mm. in width, and will have a thickness in the range of about 0.5l.Omm. A pad 16 , either made of artificial, desirably fibrous material such as polyester or of natural donor eye tissue as by reflecting or folding a posterior flap F of scleral tissue back upon itself along the dashed lines as shown in Figure 3 may be appropriately fashioned. With reference to the embodiment shown inFigures 6 and 7, a web or membrane of soft, flexible material 20 such as silicone rubber may be fastened to the strip 12 to form a generally hollow cavity 22 within which may be supported an internally threaded, annular washer 24 of rigid plastic or metal or other rigid substance. A short, exteriorly threaded bolt 26 may be threadingly received in the washer, as depicted, the bolt desirably having a gently rounded surface 27 in contact with the membrane 20 or with a dished plate 29 itself in contact with the membrane 20 . In this manner, as the bolt 26 is screwed inwardly or outwardly of the washer 24 , the pressure of the bolt face 27 against the membrane 20 or plate 29 , and hence the pressure of the membrane against the posterior portion of the eye obverse to the macula, may be adjusted.Magnetic means may be provided to permit adjustment of the position of the bolt, such means being depicted in Figures 5 and 6 as a small bar magnet 28 embedded in the outer surface of the bolt 26 and having north and south poles on either side of the axis of rotation of the bolt. In this manner, once the prosthesis has been affixed to the globe, the bolt 26 may be turned through appropriate manipulation of a large magnet about the head of the recipient so that the membrane displaces the macula forwardly along the optical axis the desired distance. This feature permits the thickness of the pad to be adjusted after affixation of the prosthesis so that the most appropriate axial length of the globe is obtained.Desirably, the threads of the washer 24 or bolt 26 or both, and the other surfaces that slide past one another are appropriately lubricated to enable the bolt to be easily turned within the washer. The edges 30 of the washer may be tapered as desired to reduce sharp exterior angles. As described more fully below with reference to Figures 12 and 13, the anterior surface of the membrane 27 or plate 29 may be contoured to provide an astigmatic correction. In the embodiment ofFigures 5 and 6 in which the bolt 26 may rotate but the membrane 27 and plate 29 do not, the orientation of an astigmatic corrective contour does not change as the bolt is rotated. If desired, of course, the plate 29 may be fixed to and rotatable with the bolt so that the orientation of the astigmatic correction may be adjusted as well. It will also be understood that the bolt 26 may be affixed to the plate 29 , the membrane 27 or the strip 12 to restrain it from rotation, and the threaded washer instead may be provided with magnetic poles, the axial position of the bolt 26 thus being adjusted through rotation of the washer through magnetic coupling to an external magnet. Figure 7 shows another embodiment of the invention in which the interior of the pad is provided with an inflatable reservoir 32 . Means for inflating the reservoir, typified as a small diameter tube 34 , extends between the reservoir and the exterior of the device. When the prosthesis has been suitably affixed to the globe, the reservoir may be inflated with saline or other fluid through the tube 34 through the use of a hypodermic syringe or the like, the degree of inflation depending upon the desired anterior displacement of the macula. Desirably, a settable or hardenable fluid is used as the injection medium, one such fluid being a curable silicone rubber.In the latter embodiment, once the prosthesis has been affixed and the intraocular pressure has stabilized, the settable or hardenable fluid may be injected through the tube 34 into the reservoir 32 until the macula has been moved anteriorly the desired distance, following which that degree of inflation is maintained until the fluid solidifies. Exterior portions of the tube 34 can then be removed. As mentioned above with reference to Figures 12 and 13, the surface of the pad 16 that comes into contact with the globe may be contoured to provide some astigmatic correction. As depicted in the drawing, the pad may be raised slightly in a direction normal to the optic axis to form an elongated bulge or rounded rib 36 , the contour of which is transmitted to and is reflected to some extent by a similar curvature or contour of the macula. Although only a single contour change is shown in the embodiment of Figures 12 and 13, the pad may be contoured as desired. Figures 8 10 show a preferred positioning of the prosthesis of the invention when implanted in the eye, Tenon s capsule being omitted for purposes of clarity. The device of the invention commonly may be affixed without requiring any of the eye muscles to be severed. One end of the device is passed behind the globe and over the rearward globe surface obverse to the macula and laterally of the optic nerve 0 . One end of the strip 12 passes superiorly over the superior oblique muscle and under the rectus muscle and is attached at its end 14 by means of sutures 40 or the like to the sclera of the host eye. The other end 14 of the prosthesis passes inferiorly under both the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, and similarly is attached to the sclera of the eye by sutures 40 or the like.To permit the tension of the strip 12 to be adjusted postoperatively as on an out patient basis , the strip 12 may be doubled back upon itself as shown in Figure 14 to provide an adjustable pleat, the doubled back portion 42 being attached to the anterior portion of the strip by means of adjustable sutures 44 that can be drawn as taut as desired to provide optimum visual correction.Other tension adjusting means, of course, may also be used. When in place, the pad 16 is positioned directly against the eye wall obverse to the macula and is spaced laterally a short distance from the optic nerve. The recess 18 desirably formed in the pad tends to further reduce the possibility of contact between the pad and optic nerve. The strip 12 is held in place by the sutures 40 and by action of the eye muscles, particularly the superior and inferior rectus muscles and the superior and inferior oblique muscles, and the orientation of the strip against the eyeball generally follows a circumference of the eyeball passing through the point on the globe obverse to the macula. Further sutures can be added, as needed, to reduce any propensity of the strip to move once it has been correctly positioned. Thus, the present invention provides a prothesis which can be readily used to improve the vision of nearsighted or myopic patients by displacing the macula of the retina anteriorly along the optic axis.The degree of macula displacement, resulting from indentation of the globe obverse to the macula, may depend, in. one embodiment, upon the thickness of the pressure pad that is employed or upon strip tension, and in other embodiments upon the exterior adjustment of the pressure pad thickness after the prosthesis has been implanted. The prosthesis may be used as a plumbage in aid of further surgical procedures, as in the repair of retinal holes in the posterior polar region, the latter sometimes occuring in severe diabetic and trauma cases, and may also be used to reduce posterior staphyloma or bulging of the globe in the region of the macula to improve the vascular supply to the posterior retinal area and to reduce mechanical damage to the retina in the macular area. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
