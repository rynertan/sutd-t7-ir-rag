## Abstract
A porous titanate glass has a glass skeleton composed mainly of titania TiO₂ and silica SiO₂ , in which the glass composition ratio weight TiO₂ SiO₂ is 0.8 to 1.7, and said glass can be made in sheet or fiber form.

## Description
POROUS TITANATE GLASS AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING IT The present invention relates to porous titanate glass and a method of producing it. The titania containing porous glass referred to as porous titanate glass hereinafter has a glass skeleton composed mainly of titania and silica, and the invention extends to sheets and fibers of such glass, and method of producing them. A porous glass having an indefinite number of pores with a pore size of several Angstroms to several thousands of Angstroms 1 A 0.1 nm has already been proposed as suitable for use inter alia as adsorbents, catalysts, catalyst supports, gas sensors, ultrafiltration media, and carriers for immobilized enzymes. Such porous glasses are generally made from oxide glass. Those made of a SiO2 B203 Na 203 composition system and those produced from a SiO2 B2o3 Na2O Al2O3 Cao Mgo composition system are known and in practical use. All of these porous glasses have a high silica content and are used for the production of high silica glasses such as Yvssycor glass or the like.Such porous glasses that are produced from the SiO2 B203 Na2O composition system and the SiO2 B2 0 Na20 Al2 0 CaO MgO composition system are characterized by their pore size and specific surface area being controllable by regulating the heat treatment conditions during the phase separation process during which time they have relatively large pores. However, when producing a porous glass from theSiO2 B203 Na20 and SiO2 B203 Na2O Al 203 CaO MgO composition systems, the raw fused glass has the disadvantage of exhibiting such a high viscosity it is difficult to remove bubbles, resulting in requiring a fusion process of more than two hours at l,5000C. Instead of producing a porous glass having a glass skeleton containing a high proportion of silica by the above described manufacturing method, it has also been proposed to provide a porous glass having a glass skeleton produced from a titania gel or metal alcoxide. However, such porous glasses had the disadvantage of requiring a prolonged time for vitrification, and controlling the pore size of the glasses was difficult. After extensive research and experiments in an attempt to overcome the foregoing shortcomings of the conventional porous glasses and methods of producing them, the inventor has developed a titania containing porous glass having titania and silica as a glass skeleton in which the glass composition ratio of titania to silica may be in the range of 0.8 to 1.7, in distinct contrast to the high silica content porous glass produced by utilizing the phase separation of the conventional oxide glass, or the porous glass having a titania glass skeleton produced from titania or metal alcoxide. The porous titanate glass titanic acid containing porous glass of this invention provides a higher heat resistance and chemical resistance as well as a higher chemical reactivity because of itsTi OH group as compared with the prior art porous glasses. Through further research and experiments conducted on methods of producing porous titanate glass having the advantages as described above, it has been found that such porous glass may be very efficiently produced from a five component composition of 2 2 Six, A1203 B203 CaO or a six component composition of TiO2 SiO2 Al2O3 B2O3 caO mgO or alkali metal oxide or metallic element oxide . The present inventor has also conducted research and experiments with a view to overcoming the problems involved in making the porous titanate glass into sheet and fibers. The problems include difficulties with the fusing step, a tendency for crystallization to occur during the quench vitrification step, and a tendency for cracking and delaminating to take place during the acid treating step. It has been found that cracking and delaminating are attributed primarily to the crystallization and the expansion of glass during the acid treating step and that such cracking and delaminating may be prevented by prescribing for the composition of the raw material for glass according to this invention. This invention has aimed to provide a porous titanate glass which provides high heat resistance and chemical resistance alkali resistance as well as high chemical reactivity, and to provide a method of producing the titanate glass in an efficient manner while controlling the pore size and specific surface area thereof. Desirably, a method according to the invention can produce such porous titanate glass of homogeneous quality in a shortened time. Beneficially, a method according to the invention can produce a porous titanate glass in which the raw materials are easily fusible, and which is less liable to crystallize during the fusing step and has very little tendency to crack during the acid treating step. The invention also aims to provide sheets and fibers of porous titanate glass having titania and silica as a glass skeleton, and which have a wide range of applications as catalysts, gas sensors, reaction separating membranes, adsorbents and the like. According to the present invention, there is provided porous titanate glass characterized by having a glass skeleton composed mainly of titania TiO2 and silica SiO2 . The invention comprehends sheets and fibers having such a glass skeleton. Such porous titanate glass can be produced from a six component composition of TiO2 SiO2 Al 0 B 0 CaO MgO. 23 23 The glass composition ratio weight t TiO2 SiO2 may be in the range of 0.8 to 1.7. The following description is given by way of example of preferred features of the invention. This porous titanate glass may be produced efficiently by mixing starting materials containing titanium oxide TiO2 , silicic anhydride SiO2 aluminum oxide A1203 , boron oxide B203 , and calcium oxide CaO heating and fusing the materials, followed by quenching them to form a multi component oxide glass composed of a five component composition of vitrified TiO2 SiO2 A1203 B301 CaO reheating the oxide glass at a temperature of 600 0C to 9000C for a predetermined period of time to form an opaline or devitrified separate phase glass and then immersing the separate phase glass in an acid solution to leach out and remove acid soluble components. Preferably, the starting materials contain 25.0 mol of titanium oxide, 31.0 mol of silicic anhydride, 12.5 mol of aluminum oxide, 7.5 mol of boron oxide, and 24.0 mol of calcium oxide. Alternatively, the aforesaid porous glass may be produced by a method comprising the steps of mixing starting materials containing for their principal components titanium oxide, silicic anhydride, aluminum oxide, boron oxide and calcium oxide and for their accessory components at least one of magnesium oxide, alkali metal oxide and metallic element oxide, heating and fusing the material, followed by quenching it to form a multi component oxide glass having a composition of vitrified TiO2 SiO2 A1203 B203 CaO MgO X20 O wherein X20 is alkali metal oxide and Y O is metallic element oxide , reheating said oxide glass at a temperature of 6000C to 900 0C for a predetermined period of time to form an opaline or devitrified separate phase glass, and then immersing said separate phase glass in an acid solution to leach out and remove acid soluble components.

More specifically, sheets of porous titanate glass as described above may be produced by mixing starting materials containing titanium oxide, silicic anhydride, aluminum oxide, boron oxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide so that the composition of the materials on the basis of mol of the oxides is such that TiO2 SiO2 A1203 B203 CaO MgO is 1.20 to 1.40, TiO2 Si02 is 0.5 to 1.0, B203 A1203 is 1.0 to 0.6 and MgO CaO is 0.21 to 0.06, heating and fusing the mixture, then quenching and shaping it to form a sheet of multi component oxide glass composed of vitrified TiO2 SiO2 Awl 203 B 203 CaO MgO, reheating said oxide glass in sheet form at a temperature of 6000C to 900 C, preferably 7000C to 850 0C, more preferably 750 0C to 800 0C for a predetermined period of time to form an opaline or divitrified separate phase glass, and then immersing said separate phase glass in an acid solution to leach out and remove acid soluble components. Fibers of porous titanate glass as described above may be produced by mixing starting materials containing titanium oxide,silicic anhydride, aluminum oxide, boron oxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide so that the composition of the materials on the basis of mol of the oxides is such that TiO2 SiO2 awl203 B203 CaO MgO is 1.20 to 1.40,TiO2 SiO2 is 0.5 to 1.0, B203 A1203 is 1.0 to 0.6 and MgO CaO is 0.21 to 0.06, heating and fusing the mixture, then spinning and quenching it to form fibers of multi component oxide glass composed of vitrified TiO2 SiO2 A1203 B203 CaO MgO, reheating said fibrous oxide glass at a temperature of 6000C to 9000C preferably 7000C to 8500C, more preferably 7500C to 8000C for a predetermined period of time to form opaline or divitrified separate phase glass fibers, and then immersing said separate phase glass in an acid solution to leach out and remove acid soluble components. In the aforesaid methods of producing sheet and fibers of porous titanate glass, the ratios of B203 A1203 and MgO CaO are preferably decreased as the ratio of TiO2 SiO2 is increased from 0.5 to 1.0. Optionally, a part about 0.5 mol of SiO2 may be substituted for by metallic element oxide such as MoO3, SeO3, Ni203 or the like, e.g. 0.5 1 mol thereof, so that the metallic element oxide is supported on the porous glass skeleton to reduce delaminating. In the aforesaid methods of producing porous titanate glass in sheet or fibrous form, the mix of starting maters may comprise 18.0 28.0 mol of titanium oxide, 38.0 28.0 mol of silicic anhydride, 10.0 12.5 mol of aluminum oxide, 7.5 mol of boron oxide, 21.0 22.5 mol of calcium oxide, and 4.5 1.5 mol of magnesium oxide. Suitable raw materials which may be used in this invention are as follows, although this invention is not limited to these materials The titanium oxide source may include oxides, hydroxides, alkoxides, and carbonate of titanium, and the like.

The pore size and specific surface area of porous titanate glass may be controlled by regulating the heat treating conditions for the phase separating step during the manufacturing process. In addition, the fused glass material according to this invention has such a low viscosity that it is easy to remove bubbles and produce a homogeneous glass in 30 to 60 minutes of fusion process at l,4000C. Thus, the present invention is capable of producing a porous titanate glass in an energy saving manner as compared with the production of conventional porous glass. The invention will be explained in more detail in the following non limitative description, which is given by way of example, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the process of producing a porous titanate glass according to this invention Fig. 2 is a graph showing changes in the specific surface area due to the adjustments of the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature for porous titanate glass according to this invention Fig. 3 is a graph showing changes in average pore radius due to adjustments of the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature for porous titanate glass according to this invention Fig. 4 is a graph showing the results of thermogravimetric TG analysis and differential thermal analysis DTA conducted on the porous titanate glass according to this invention and on commercially available silica glass Fig. 5 is a graph showing the alkali resistances of the porous titanate glass according to this invention and of a commercially available silica glass Fig. 6 is a graph showing changes in the specific surface area due to adjustments of the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature for another porous titanate glass according to this invention Fig. 7 is a graph showing changes in the average pore radius due to adjustments of the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature for another porous titanate glass according to this invention Fig. 8 is a graph showing the changes in the distribution of pore sizes due to adjustments of the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature for porous titanate glass of this invention and Fig. 9 is a graph showing the alkali resistances of another porous titanate glass according to this invention and of a commercially available silica glass.Example 1 Fig. 1 illustrates successive steps of the present manufacturing process for porous titanate glass. Starting materials containing 25.0 TiO2 31.0 SiO2 12.5 Al 03 7.5 B 24.0 CaO mol composition were thoroughly mixed together in a ball mill or the like. The mixture was then fused by heating in an electric furnace at 14000C for 30 to 60 minutes, and quenched by placing it in a water bath, followed by shaping it to form a transparent raw glass. Subsequently, when the raw glass was heated at a temperature of 6000C to 9000C for a predetermined period of time in the range of 0.5 to 100 hours, changing it from its transparent state to an opaline or devitrified state whereby a separate phase glass was obtained.This separatephase glass was immersed in a hydrochloric acid solution at 90CC for 1 to 2 hours to leach out and remove acid soluble components, whereby a porous glass having a glass skeleton of acid insoluble TiO2 and SiO2 remaining therein was produced. It was found that the thus produced porous titanate glass had a composition weight of 37.5 TiO2 46.0 SiO2 14.3 Al2O3 2.17 CaO. The composition analysis of the foregoing starting materials and porous titanate glass was carried out by X ray fluorescence analysis As stated hereinabove, the porous titanate glass according to this invention makes it possible to control the pore size and specific surface area by regulating the heat treatment conditions heating temperature and time for the phase separation step, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 shows the changes in the specific surface area of porous titanate glass as the heat treatment conditions for the phase separation are varied when producing a porous titanate glass using the raw material composition as described above. Fig. 3 shows the changes in the average pore radius of porous titanate glass as the heat treatment conditions for the phase separation are varied when producing a porous titanate glass using the same material composition as forFig. 2. The heat treating time was twelve hours for either case. The average pore radius was measured using a soaped mat. As is seen from Figs. 2 and 3, as the heat treatment temperature rises, the specific surface area decreases whereas the pore radius increases. It is thus possible to produce a porous titanate glass having any desired pore 2 structure with a specific surface area ranging from 500 m g 2 D o to 10 m g and a pore radius ranging from 20 A to 500 A 2 to 50 nm by changing the heat treatment temperature and heating time. The heat resistance and chemical resistance characteristics of the porous titanate glass produced by the method of this invention will be discussed below. Fig. 4 shows the changes in weight heat resistance characteristics versus changes in temperature for porous titanate glass produced according to the present invention.The curve a in the graph represents the porous titanate glass while the curve b represents a commercially available high silica glass. The curves indicate the results of thermogravimetric TG analysis and differential thermal analysis DTA in which samples each weighing 80 mg were used. The samples were heated to 4000C in a DTA furnace and then cooled down, followed by measuring the samples at a heating up rate of 50C min and with DTA sensitivity of i25 V. The commercially available high silica glass, which had been subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of about 6000C exhibited no noticeable change in weight at temperatures between 5000C and 600 C, but showed a higher rate of weight change at temperatures exceeding 7000C. On the other hand, the porous titanate glass exhibited less changes in weight at temperatures between 6500C and 8550C, which showed that it maintained a more stable pore structure within this range of temperature than the conventional porous glass composed mainly of silica. The DTA curve shows transition points at 7980C and 856 C, the latter of which is the temperature at which sintering begins to occur at the surface of glass. In view of the changes in TG it is believed that the OH s of Ti OH and Si OH will be lost at this temperature of 8560C. As indicated above, it is to be appreciated that the porous titanate glass produced according to this invention has a high heat resistance as well as a high chemical reactivity as the Ti OH and Si OH groups are retained until a higher temperature is reached. Fig. 5 shows the chemical resistance alkali resistance of the porous titanate glass. To analyze the chemical resistance, 1 g of porous titanate glass was placed on a glass filter and immersed in a 1 4 normal NaOH solution kept at 400C to measure the weight changes with time. The ordinate represents the weight of the porous titanate glass which remained on the filter while the abscissa represents the immersion time. The curve a represents a commercially available porous silica glass while the curve b represents a porous titanate glass according to this invention which was produced through a phase separation process at 7200C for 12 hours, followed by annealing strengthening at 4000C for 12 hours. The curve c represents another porous titanate glass which was subjected to the same phase separation process but annealed or subjected to strengthening treatment at 7000C for 12 hours. As is seen from the graph of Fig. 5, the commercially available porous silica glass a was completely dissolved after 100 hours of alkali leaching, whereas the porous titanate glass according to this invention provides a higher chemical resistance than the conventional porous silica glass in that 60 and 80 of the porous titanate glasses b and c which were subjected to annealing strengthening treatment at 4000C and 7000C, respectively remained undissolved after 100 hours of alkali leaching.Example 2 Porous glasses were produced in the same manner as described with respect to Example 1, using the starting materials A Sample 2 and B Sample 3 indicated in the left columns of Table 1 below. The compositions weight of the resulting porous titanate glasses were shown in the right columns of Table 1.

As is seen from Table 1, the glass composition ratio wt of titania to silica TiO2 SiO2 is 0.8 for Sample 2 and 1.3 for Sample 3. In both Sample 2 and 3, as in Example 1, it was possible to control the pore size and specific surface area by adjusting the heat treatment conditions heating temperature and time as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The heat treatment conditions and method of measurement were the same as withExample 1. As is seen from Figs. 6 and 7, as the heat treatment temperature rises, the specific surface area decreases whereas the pore radius increases. It is thus possible to produce a porous titanate glass having any desired pore structure with 2 2 a specific surface area ranging from 500 m g to 10 m g and a pore radius ranging from 20 to 500 2 to 50 nm by changing the heat treatment temperature phase separation temperature and heating time.Example 3 One of the features of the present invention is to add a metallic element oxide such as MoO3, SeO3 or Fe2O3 to the starting material composition and have such metallic element oxide supported on a glass skeleton. In conventional porous glass produced from oxide glass, most of any metallic element oxide incorporated in the starting materials is leached out by the acid treatment with only a trace amount thereof remaining. In contrast, according to the present invention, the metallic element oxide added to the starting material composition is not completely removed during the acid leaching treatment but remains supported on the skeleton of porous titanate glass. By way of example, MoO3 was used as a metallic element oxide, and a porous titanate glass was produced from the starting material composition of 26.0 TiO2 25.0 SiO2 16.0A1203 5.0 B303 24.5 CaO 2.5 Na2O 1.0 MoO3 on a mol basis . The chemical composition of the resulting porous titanate glass was as shown in Table 2 below, and the composition ratio wt. of titania to silica was 1.7. Table 2 Oxides TiO SiO2 Awl203 B203 CaO N 2 3 Total wt. 63.8 38.6 0.2 0 0 0.1 1.2 103.9 It was confirmed from Table 2 that the added MoO3 was contained in the porous titanate glass product. It is an important advantage in using the porous glass as a catalyst that such metallic element oxide can be supported on the porous carrier. It has also been found that the composition amounts of A1203 and Na 203 would vary depending upon the phase separation and acid treatment conditions.Example 4 As shown in Table 3 listed below, while according to the present invention, porous titanate glass may be produced fundamentally from a six component system comprising TiO2 SiO2 A1203 B203 CaO Na2O Samples 4 6 , an equimolar amount of Li2O may be used in place of Na2O Sample 7 .Alternatively, if 5.0 or more mol of MgO is added, such porous titanate glass may be produced even from a composition of non alkali metal oxides Sample 8 . The added metallic element oxides Samples 9 12 and 15 have the effect of reducing the cracking of the glass and enlarging the phase separation region of the glass. The amount of such metallic element oxides remaining in the porous titanate glass product vary depending on the heat treatment conditions and metallic elements used. The amount of TiO2 in the starting materials may be increased to such an extent that the molar ratio of SiO2 toTiO2 becomes about 0.4. However, if the ratio of SiO2 TiO2 is 1.0 or below, it is difficult to completely vitrify the composition due to crystallization when the method of quenching the melt by depositing it in a water bath is utilized for the quenching step. With the SiO2 TiO2 ratio in the range from 1.0 to 2.0, the composition may be easily vitrified to obtain glass in the form of particles, sheet or hollow fiber.

The solid line curve a , broken line curve b and chain line curve c show the pore distributions for the glasses produced under different heat treatment conditions for the phase separation. Specifically, the heat treatment conditions were 7000C and 15 hours for the glass a 7200C and 15 hours for the glass b and 740 C and 15 hours for the glass c .With the heat treatment a at 7000C for 15 hours, there are a considerable number of pores having a radius on the order of 20 , 2 nm , whereas with the heat treatment c at 7400C for 15 hours, there are pores of radius 80 8 nm and 150 to 250 15 to 25 nm , but no pores having a radius on the order of 20 2 nm . It is to be understood that the pore size increases with a rise in the heat treatment temperature. Upon analyzing the weight changes versus temperature changes, namely the heat resistance of the porous titanate glass produced from the starting material composition shown in the Sample 7, the same results as those shown in Fig. 4 were obtained. It was thus seen that the porous titanate glass produced according to this invention had a higher heat resistance and a more stable pore structure than the conventional porous glass composed mainly of silica as well as having a high chemical reactivity as the Ti OH and Si OH groups were retained until a higher temperature was reached. Fig. 9 shows the chemical resistance alkali resistance of the porous titanate glass. These results were obtained by placing 1 g of porous titanate glass on a glass filter and immersing it in a 1 4 normal NaOH solution kept at 400C to measure the weight changes with time. The ordinate of the graph represents the weight of the porous titanate glass which remained on the filter while the abscissa represents the immersion time. The curve a represents a commercially available porous silica glass while the curve b represents a porous titanate glass which was produced by subjecting the fused glass of theSample 6 to phase separation treatment at 7200C for 12 hours.The glass was annealed or subjected to strengthening process at 400or for 12 hours. The curve c represents the porous titanate glass which is the same as that of b but which was anhealed or subjected to strengthening treatment at 7000C for 12 hours. The curve d represents a porous titanate glass which was produced from the starting material composition shown in Sample 7 and which was annealed or subjected to strengthening treatment at 7000C for 12 hours. As is seen from the graph of Fig. 9, the commercially available porous silica glass a was completely dissolved after 100 hours of alkali leaching, whereas the porous titanate glass according to this invention provides a higher chemical resistance than the conventional porous silica glass in that 60 to 80 of the porous titanate glasses b , c and d which were subjected to annealing or strengthening treatment at 4000C and 700 C, respectively remained undissolved after 100 hours of alkali leaching. The preferred material compositions for producing a sheet and fibers of porous titanate glass according to the present invention, and such material compositions having metallic element oxide added thereto are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. With the materials in the range of composition as shown, the fusing step is facilitated, crystallization is very unlikely to occur during the quench vitrification step, cracking and delaminating are minimized during the acid treating step, and it is possible to manufacture a homogeneous quality of porous titanate glass in sheet form in a short time.

Starting materials used were of the composition 4 inTable 4 which comprised 25.0 TiO2, 31.0 SiO2, 12.5 Awl203 7.5 B203, 22.5 CaO, and 1.5 MgO mol composition . These materials were thoroughly mixed together in a ball mill or the like. The mixture was then fused by heating in an electric furnace at l,4000C for 30 to 60 minutes, quenched by placing it in a water bath, and shaped rolled to form a transparent sheet of glass.Then, as the sheet of glass was heated at a temperature of 6000C to 9000C, preferably 7000C to 850 C, more preferably 7500C to 8000C for a predetermined period of time in th range of 4 to 12 hours, the glass was changed from its t ansparent state to an opaline or devitrified state whereby a separate phase glass in sheet form was obtained. This separate phase glass was immersed in a hydrochloric acid solution of 0.5N 1.ON at 900C for 1 to 12 hours to leach out and remove acid soluble components, whereby a sheet of porous glass with a glass skeleton of acid insoluble TiO2 andSiO2 remainirg was produced. The porous glass was dried in a vacuum at l 00C, and was then annealed or subjected to strengthening treatment at 7000C as required. It was found that the thus produced porous titanate glass had a composition weight of 37.5 TiO2 46.0 SiO2 14.3 A1203 2.17 CaO. The composition analysis of the foregoing starting materials and porous titanate glass was carried out by X ray fluorescence analysisExample 6 This example is illustrative of the method of producing porous titanate glass in fibrous form according to the present invention.Starting materials used were of the composition 4 in Table 4 which comprised 25.0 TiO2, 31.0 SiO2, 12.5 Al n 2 3 7.5 B203, 22.5 CaO, and 1.5 MgO mol composition . These materials were thoroughly mixed together in a ball mill or the like. The mixture was fused by heating in an electric furnace at l,4000C for 30 to 60 minutes. The thus fused mixture was spun by a conventional solution spinning process and quenched to form transparent glass in fibrous form. Then, as the transparent glass in fibrous form was heated lAt a temperature of 6000C to 9000C, preferably 7000C to 8500C, more preferably 7500C to 8000C for a predetermined period of time in the range of 4 to 12 hours, the glass was changed from its transparent state to an opaline or devitrified state whereby a separate phase glass in fibrous form was obtained. This separate phase glass was immersed in a hydrochloric acid solution of 0.5 N 1.0 N at 900C for 1 to 12 hours to leach out and remove solid soluble components, whereby porous glass fibers with a glass skeleton of acid insoluble TiO2 and SlO2 remaining was produced.Subsequently, the porous glass fibers were immersed in a titanium tetrahydroxide Ti OH 4 solution and then dried in a vacuum at ll00C, followed by annealing or strengthening treatment at 700 CC as required. This immersion treatment in titanium tetrahydroxide Ti OH 4 solution may be omitted. Titanium tetrachloride TiC14 or Titanium alcoxide Ti O R 4 whereinR is alkyl group may be used in substitution for titanium tetrahydride Ti OH 4 . It was found that the thus produced porous titanate glass fibers had a composition weight of 37.5 TiO2 46.0 SiO2 14.3 Al 203 2.17 CaO. The composition analysis of the foregoing starting materials and porous titanate glass was carried out by X ray fluorescence analysis It is to be understood that the spinning process in producing porous titanate glass in fibrous form is not limited to the solution spinning method as described above but may be carried out any suitable method. While the diameter of glass fibers produced may vary depending upon the spinning method employed, short fibers on the order of 0.5 mm in length may generally have a diameter of less than several 5 fm, and long fibers may have a diameter 0 greater than 15 A 1.5 nm . The foregoing porous glass has a glass skeleton composed of titania and silica and exhibits high heat resistance and chemical resistance alkali resistance as well as high chemical reactivity.The porous titanate glass is suitable for use inter alia as an adsorbent, catalyst, catalyst support, gas sensor, ultrafiltration medium, reaction separating membrane, and carrier for immobiized enzymes.
