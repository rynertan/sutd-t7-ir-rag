# Sensor array.

## Abstract
A sensor array includes a number of discrete elements 2 each comprising a dielectric body 6 and two electrodes 4, 5 . Dielectric body 6 has an annular skirt 12 and the electrodes define an annular gap 8 in which an end portion of the skirt is located. Body 6 is displaced relative to the electrodes upon application of pressure thereto, causing the skirt to further penetrate the gap and cause a detectable change in capacitance of the electrodes, related to the magnitude of the applied pressure. The dielectric bodies 6 are supported by a common, resilient sheet which returns the bodies to a rest position when pressure is removed.
