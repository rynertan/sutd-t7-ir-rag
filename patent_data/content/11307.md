# Method and apparatus for character code generation.

## Abstract
Generation of a character code for a selected alphabetic character is performed by depressing a plurality of keys in a particular sequence, until all those keys are simultaneously operated. Numerical character codes are generated by depre ssing only one key per numerical character. The circuitry dis tinguishes constituent key operations of a plural key opera tion from a single key operation for a numerical character. The circuitry includes a microprocessor 54 , an arithme tic logic unit 54 , and a storage 56 having a number of registers R1 R5 for storing the history of depressed keys, and a character code table for read out of character codes.
