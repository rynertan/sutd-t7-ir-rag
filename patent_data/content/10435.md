## Abstract
An apparatus for transmitting force between a wheeled cart 17 and an in floor conveyor chain 18 that includes a pin 23 mounted on the cart which pivots out of engagement with the conveyor chain 18 when a predetermined thrust is exceeded. A bumper handle 10 connected to the pin 23 via a resilient link 20 assists the pin 23 in retracting from engagement with the conveyor chain 18 when the bumper handle 10 strikes an obstacle in the path of the cart 17 .
