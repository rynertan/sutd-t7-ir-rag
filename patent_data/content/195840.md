# Offshore structure incorporating a conductor deflecting system.

## Abstract
An offshore structure that is supported above the water s surface by at least one substantially vertically dis posed leg which extends to the ocean floor. The structure is adapted to accommodate a vertical member or riser conducter 20 having a deflector segment 26 capable of engaging one or more fluid carrying conduits or risers 19 which are lowered therethrough. The defector segment 26 is positioned to engage a lowering riser end so that the riser will be urged outwardly and away from the base of the structure. The riser or risers 19 can thus be readily con nected to subsea pipelines which terminate adjacent to the foot of the offshore structure.
