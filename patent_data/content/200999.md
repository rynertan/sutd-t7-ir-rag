# Controlling a nuclear reactor with dropped control rods.

## Abstract
A pressurized water reactor control system in which a dropped control rod is detected by a negative rate of change of neutron flux which exceeds a preset negative limit, is adapted to control the reactor such that the reactor is only shutdown if the axial offset exceeds a preselected dropped rod limit, so that it is possible to maintain power, and in many cases full power, despite the presence of a dropped rod. Where part length control rods are used during power changes, separate limiting values on axial offset are used when these rods are fully inserted and when they are fully retracted.
