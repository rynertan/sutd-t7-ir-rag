## Description
ANALOG PANEL METER MECHANISMBackground of the Invention This invention relates to electrical measurement devices of the moving coil, permanent magnet type. Moving coil permanent magnet electrical meter mechanisms are known in the prior art, as illustrated by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,024,472, 3,490,043, 3,005,952 and 3,551,812. Such devices comprise many small, precisely machined or formed parts. Assembly of these prior art devices typically requires several manual insertion or alignment steps which are labor intensive and obviously increases the cost of manufacture. Moreover, the components such as coil frame and the permanent magnet are complicated and expensive to manufacture, as in U.S. Pat.No. 3,055,182 where the coil frame includes typical coil retaining flanges, mounting tabs, etc., and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,005,952 and 4,024,452 where the magnet is manufactured by a cold pressing process. Assembly of the prior art meters further requires movement of a subassembly in one direction, to combine with an additional component, followed by movement of the resulting combination in an opposite direction. Such back and forth precise manipulation of the various subassemblies is time consumptive, labor intensive and thus expensive. In taut band suspensions for electrical meters, and particularly for those subject to mechanical stress, damping devices are preferred to restrain vibration induced in the moving coil assembly through the suspension. The use of a viscous liquid, specifically oil, to provide such damping is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,439,273 and in a publication of Crompton Instruments, U S 700, June 1974, pages 5 and 6. The prior art use of oil damping, however, requires the use of additional structural components and to keep the damping oil in place, thus adding to the expense of producing the meter. Specifically, closed cell foamed plastic pads are required. The prior art does not suggest the use of oil damping without such expensive structural modifications of a meter mechanism. In the past, it has been the practice to use magnets formed of alloys of cobalt, an expensive material. Meter mechanisms using more readily available and less expensive ceramic magnets have not found widespread use because of high temperature variation in operating characteristics. one illustration of the use of a ceramic magnet in a meter mechanism is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,490,043. However, this reference fails to disclose any method or apparatus for compensation of the temperature variable characteristics of the magnet. As described by Parker and Studders, in Permanent Magnets andTheir Application, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1962, ceramic magnets exhibit a temperature coefficient of approximately 0.2 remanence change per degree centigrade from room temperature, while variousAlnico materials have such coefficients which are typically in the range of .02 to .01 percent. Thus, although the base materials for ceramic magnets are inexpensive and plentiful, and are not strategic materials, Alnico magnets which use up to 36 percent cobalt are clearly superior in temperature stability. Two methods are known for compensation of the large temperature coeffecient of ceramic magnets. One such method relies on the use of oversaturated pole pieces in conjunction with the ceramic magnet.This is, the magnetic field includes more magnetic flux than can be concentrated by the pole piece. If sufficient margin is provided above the saturation level for the pole piece, a reduction in the magnetic flux density due to temperature increases may leave the air gap flux density unaffected since the pole piece remains at or above its saturation level. However, this approach prohibits the use of the standard charging and treating calibration procedure for the meter mechanism. In the charging and treating method, the permanent magnet is initially charged to a higher flux density than required to achieve the needed sensitivity. In a subsequent treating step, the magnetization level is reduced, to lower the sensitivity to the desired calibrated value. Where the excessive flux density is relied upon for compensation of the magnet s high temperature coefficient of remanence change, it is apparent that the charging and treating method affects the degree of temperature compensation. Accordingly, the method of oversaturation of the pole piece requires the use of an expensive calibration technique for the meter mechanism, in which a separate conductivity shunt is required to be selected, soldered in place and adjusted to bypass a fraction of the meter current. The prior art has thus avoided the use of ceramic permanent magnets for moving coil meter mechanisms, because of both the high temperature variability and the difficulty of sensitivity calibration of temperature compensated mechanisms. In a second compensation method, a special nickel iron alloy shunt is used to divert a portion of the flux density from the air gap, the diverted portion decreasing with increasing temperature. This approach is described in Parker et al for a drag device such as a watt hour meter. No such compensation is available in the prior art, however, for a moving coil permanent magnet type of meter.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a general object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for measuring electrical quantities. This and other objects are attained, in accordance with one aspect of the invention by a moving coil permanent magnet mechanism for measuring electrical quantities, comprising a moving coil wound about a flangeless support means a balance cross structure for providing balanced support for a pointer hub means for engaging said balance cross structure to said support means, said hub means including longitudinal indentations for engaging edges of a surface of said support means and extension portions dimensioned to prevent relative longitudinal movement between said hub means and said support means and torsional spring means connected to said balance cross structure for suspending an assembly of said hub means, said balance cross structure, and said support means. Another aspect includes a mechanism having two relatively movable assemblies for metering electrical parameters, wherein a first assembly is connected to a second assembly by a torsional suspension means, said second assembly having a component rotationally movable with reference to said first assembly, comprising viscous damping means for control of mechanical vibrations between said first and second assemblies, including a damping control area, defined by a predetermined portion of said component of said second assembly a viscous liquid contacting said predetermined portion of said component defining said damping control area and anti wetting means provided on further portions of said component for retaining said viscous liquid in contact with, and preventing its spread from, said damping control area. A further aspect is attained by a method for temperature compensation of the permanent magnet of a moving coil meter mechanism having a permanent magnet, pole pieces arranged for forming a housing for said permanent magnet, a yoke structure, and a wound coil movable in an air gap formed between the pole pieces and the yoke structure, said method comprising the steps of a determining a magnetic flux density to be established within said air gap for linking said movable wound coil b establishing limits for acceptable variation of said flux density within said air gap for a predetermined temperature range and c reducing variations in said flux density within said air gap to be within the established limits for the predetermined temperature range, including the step of placing an appropriately dimensioned compensating shunt, formed of material having a temperature dependent permeability, adjacent and parallel to said permanent magnet. Yet another aspect includes a moving coil meter mechanism having a permanent magnet, pole pieces arranged for forming a housing for said permanent magnet, a yoke structure and a wound coil movable in an air gap formed between the pole pieces and the yoke structure, the meter mechanism including means for providing compensation for variations in flux density within said air gap caused by temperature changes, comprising compensating shunt means formed of material having a temperature variable permeability, said compensating shunt means being positioned adjacent and parallel to said permanent magnet and having a thickness selected for reducing the temperature caused variations in flux density within said air gap to predetermined acceptable limits. Brief DescriPtion of the Drawing These and other objects and features of the present invention will be ame more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures, wherein Figure 1 shows an exploded assembly view of a meter mechanism according to the present invention Figure 2 illustrates the individual components used to form the assemblies of Figure 1, both in exploded and subassemblied form Figures 3A and 3B show details of a hub component of the inventive mechanism in plan and side views, respectively and Figure 4 shows a bottom view of a top bridge component for the inventive mechanism and Figures 5A, B, and C show various configurations of a viscous E mDins system in accordance with the invention.Best de for Carrying Out the Invention An improved moving coil permanent magnet meter mechanism according to the present invention is shown in Fig. 1 and includes a moving coil and rotor assembly 1, a permanent magnet 2, a housing assembly 3 therefor, a U shaped bottom bridge support assembly 4, a top bridge assembly 5, and a yoke 6. As will be appreciated, the several assemblies cooperate to provide angular rotation of moving coil assembly 1 and a deflection of a pointer attached thereto in response to the flow of current through the coil of assembly 1. WMen assembled, permanent magnet 2 is located within housing 3, and coil and rotor assembly 1 surrounds housing 3. The several assemblies are supported by bottom support assembly 4 and capped by top bridge assembly 5. This supported and capped assembly is mounted within yoke 6, such that the wound coil of assembly 1 is within an annular air gap defined between housing 3 and yoke 6.Magnet 2 generates a magnetic field in the air gap between pole pieces of its housing 3 and yoke 6, and the magnetic field generated by current flow through the winding of coil assembly 1 provides a torque operative to rotate the coil and pointer to a position of equilibrium with the developed torque in the torsional spring taut band . Referring to Figure 2, the coil and rotortassembly 1 is shown as including a flangeless moving coil frame 10. For economy and ease of ranufacture, coil frame 10 is provided as a simple extruded component, without locating tabs, protrusions, indents, or the like. The coil frame is formed by slicing a rectangular extrusion at appropriate intervals to provide a plurality of inexpensive coil frames of appropriate thicknesses. A wire winding 12 is provided on coil frame 10. Preferably an adhesively coated wire is wound around the coil frame. Wire 12 may be heated after winding on frame 10 to activate the adhesive, thereby causing the various winnings to adhere both to each other and to the frame itself. As a result, an integrated and strengthened rotor subassembly results. Wire 12 is not wound along the entire width of the surface of coil frame 10, however. Rather, a margin 11 is left along the edges of the frame surfaces to enable clamping engagement of.a plastic hub 14 thereto. A balance cross and taut band assembly 16 is provided for mounting a pointer 18 to indicate the electrical quantity being measured. A taut band 20 is attached to balance cross assembly 16, preferably by welding the band to the underside thereof. A tail section 22 and a side section 24 are provided for static balancing of balance cross assembly 16. Ballast weight may be added to the tail and side sections, as needed, by winding a number of turns of wire thereon. A terminating loop 25 of conductive material is provided on the balance cross for one end of moving coil wire 12, while taut band 20 is used to provide external contact to loop 26, and hence to wire 12. The entire balance cross assembly may be conductive, or only the terminating loop may be conductive. A pair of upstanding tabs 28 are provided on the central portion of assembly 16 for engaging corresponding notches 30 in the central portion of hub 14. Accordingly, hub 14 is mounted on balance cross assembly 16 by insertion of taut band 20 through an opening 31 in a central tower 32 thereof. Tabs 28 engage notches 30 and are bent over a horizontal base section 33 of hub 14 in order firmly to engage the two components together. See Fig. 3A for example. Hub 14 is further provided with an assembly aid 36, as sho n in detailed Figure 3B. The assembly aid comprises depending skirt portions 37, which include a pair of channels 38 provided therein for engagement by a spreading tool in order to mount the assembled hub and balance cross on coil frame 10. Further, for engaging the margins of coil frame 10, additional rails 40 are provided on the inner surfaces of assembly aid 36. Accordingly, when the combined hub and balance cross assembly is engaged by a spreading tool at channels 38, depending skirt portions 37 are spread so that the assembly may be mounted on coil frame 10. In order to secure the assembly to the coil frame, rails 40 engage the margin edges of the coil frame. Hub 14 also includes extension sections 42, shorn in Figure 3A and in Figure 2, arpropriately dimensioned to match the inner dimension of the coil frame, which act to self center the hub directly on the coil frame and to prevent longitudinal movement thereof. As will be aporeciated by those skilled in the art, the abovedescribed structure enables a simple, quick, and automated assembly of its several car acients when compared to prior art devices having flanged moving coil frames with tabs thereon for engaging a balance cross or similar component hile such prior art devices require the balance cross to be manually positioned on the coil frame, for example, and further require manual positioning of the coil frame tabs, the above described features of the present invention enable automated assembly of its various components. The rotor assembly including the moving coil is completed by engagement of a lower portion which, similarly to the balance cross of the upper portion, includes a counterbalance arm 44. The ccunterbalanoe arm includes a terminal 46 for connection to. the other end of moving coil wire 12, and a counterbalance 48 in which a number of notches 50 are provided.The appropriate number of notches is determined in order properly to counterbalance the weight of pointer 18 mounted on balance crass assembly 16 A number of turns of wire may be wound on terminal 46 to provide appropriate weight balanc ng. Further 2 second taut band portion 52 of the taut band suspension is provided for counterbalance arm 44, and is preferably welded to the upper surface of arm 44. A second hub 54, substantially identical with hub 14, is oviaed. Taut band portions 20 and 52 prcvide both a torsion spring for the moving coil assembly and contacts to wire winding 12. Portion 52 protrudes through a central opening in a central toper of hub 54, and assembly aids ard engagement structure similar to that of hub 14 are provided for mounting hub 54 and counterbalance arm 44 on coil frame 10. Relative movement between the taut band and the hub 14 is damped by the use of a viscous oil, as described below with reference to Figures SA SO. A permanent magnet assembly 60, shown at 2 and 3 in Figure 1, includes a pair of pole pieces 62 as seen in Figure 2. The pole pieces are firmed of high purity soft iron in order to provide sufficiently high permeability for the intended use. The upper and lower surfaces of the pole pieces are provided with steps, such as illustrated at 64 for the upper surfaces, for accepting a pair of elongated, notched upper arid lower support plates 66 and 58 between the pole pieces, thus forming a cage for a magnet 70.The support pieces rest on the lower horizontal surfaces of steps 64, and rigidly separate the vertical surfaces of the steps. The magnet subassembly is formed by welding of the upper support plate 66, and lower support plate 68, to the appropriate positions between the steps 64 of the pole pieces 62. This approach is more cast effective than the prior art approach of cementing or soldering of the magnet 70 to one of the pole pieces. Pole pieces 62 are provided with lips 72, in order to enable the use of a larger magnet and so to provide increased meter sensitivity and more efficient operation. Lips 72 act as collectors for additional flux introduced by the magnet. The pole pieces are further provided with arcuate portions 74 for concentrating the magnetic flux within the air gap formed within yoke 6. As described below with reference to Figures zA 5C, the support plattes 66 and 68 are each provided with a central area 78, shown as having an annular portion coined into the surfaces thereof.This area is used in combination with an anti wetting agent to define the shape of a drop of viscous fluid, such as silicon oil, used to provide viscous damping for the moving coil. A similar offset may be provided in the underside of frame 10 for shaping the oil drop. Such viscous damping is particularly helpful in environments wherein the meter movement is subject to vibrations and other similar mechanical stresses. In accordance with an important feature of the invention, at least one of the support plates 66 and 68 is used as a temperature compensating shunt for permanent magnet 70 which preferably is formed from a magnetic ceramic material, such as barium ferrite. Such compensation is based upon the use of a permeable material, such as nickel iron alloy, of appropriate dimensions to operate in a saturated state in the air gap. Accordingly, air gap flux variations which would otherwise result due to temperature induced changes in operating characteristics of the permanent magnet may be compensated for. Ceramic magnet 70 is shaped to high precision by regrinding e.g.with a diamond wheel to have plane parallel surfaces, a process which is more economical than that used to form Alnico magnets, which typically are made by cold forging of a powder in a die. The dimensions of magnets are chosen to provide the maximum energy product for a normal demagnetization curve. Such curves are published for specific magnet materials, and an operating point is determined by knowledge of the permeance coefficient B H for the specific magnet.As is known in the art, the permeance coefficient is a function of the dimensions of the magnet. For a rectangular ceramic magnet the permeance coefficient is calculated as follows EMI9.1 wnere L is the magnet 5 length in the direction of magnetization,W is the magnet1 S width, H is the height of the magnet and dimensions are in inches. From the published demagnetization curves and en ergy product curves, an ideal B H coefficient is determined. For example, in one actual sample manufactured in accordance with the present invention, L was set to .230 , N was set to .567 , and H was set to .640 . ThusEMI10.1 .90 Different dimensions may be used in the equation to obtain a permeance closest to the ideal value. From the actual permeance, the magnet s induction and demagnetizing force , may be determined. The magnet 5 t rnperature coefficient is known typically 0.19 cercent degree centrigrade for barium ferrite magnets . For operation in a desired temperature range, the change in flux density may be determined by multiplying the temperature range in degrees centigrade by the temperature coefficient to obtain an expected percentage change in the flux density for the particular temperature range.Multiplication of the normal flux density determined arran the demagnetization curve for the particular permeance of the magnet by the determined percentage change in flux density yields the total flux density change, in gauss per square centimeter, for example, in the magnet over the predetermined temperature range. It is this change in flux density which is to be compensated by the shunt. s described at pages 350 355 in Parker and Shudders, the number of flux lines in the shunt at a particular temperature is linearly proportional to the permeability of the material at that .ezperature and the cross sectional area of the shunt. Since the permeability of the material changes decreases with increasing temperature, it is apparent that the shunt flux decreases with increasing temperature.Inasmuch as the magnet s flux density similarly decreases with temperature, it is seen that for an a ropriate cross sectional area, the shunt diverts an appropriately decreasing portion of the magnets flux from the air gap, thereby providing a substantially constant flux subject to over or under compensation within the air gap. The cross sectional area of the shunt is thus determined from the equation 6 46 Cr A, where U is the permeability and A the cross sectional area of the shunt, and the shunt flux. Knowing the flux density to be compensated by the shunt, the number of flux lines required to pass through the shunt are determined by multiplying the flux density change by the magnet area, and the appropriate cross sectional area of the shunt is thus determined. From a knowledge of the cross sectional area of the shunt and the width thereof equal to the magnet width , the thickness of the shunt is thus determined. A number of shunts may be combined to provide a combined thickness equal to the calculated value to provide the desired temperature shunting.Thus one or both of support plates 66 and 68, having the appropriate combined thickness, may be used to provide the temperature comaensation for magnet 70. In one example, an Indox 8 ceramic magnet having dimensionsL 0.230 , W 0.567 and H 0.640 was required to operate over a temperature range of 120 0C about a nominal temperature of 25 C. For the magnet dimensions, B H 0.9, and at 250C 2 normal B Thdox 1,700 gauss cm and E 1,900 oersted. With a magnet temperature coefficient of 0.19 0C, B 1,700 x 20 x 0.198 64.6 gauss an2. For the magnet dimensions, i 65 2.3413 152 flux lines.The cross sectional area of the shunt is determined from A 46 U . Finally, a shunt having the appropriate thickness was used to determine the remaining, uncampensated error. Using the previously calculated shunt thickness and the corrected deviation, the total thickness for correcting the total flux line deviation was calculated to be 0.055 . Using a pair of shunts having a total thickness of 0.057 , one unit displayed 0.3 maximum error at 5 C and 0.6 maximum error at 450C, thus showing a slight degree of over compensation. A small reduction in compensator thickness would reduce the observed maximum error still further. Typical compensating alloy materials are 30 32 nickel iron alloys, sometimes referred to as Curie alloys. Thus, use of the abovedescribed compensation shunt permits use of inexpensive and readily available ceramic magnets, made of barium ferrite, for example, instead of the more stable but more expensive alloys of cobalt. Such magnets have not found previous use in the moving coil type of meter mechanism because such magnets were previously designed having difficult to machine shapes, because of the unacceptably high temperature variation in their characteristics, and further because previous compensation of temperature variations required the use of expensive sensitivity calibration techniques. By utilizing the type of ceramic magnet described, shunt temperature copensation as well as charge and treat calibration techniques may be used, in combination with an inexpensive parallel face diamond wheel grinding technique.The present invention thus overcomes the drawbacks previously associated with the use of these inexpensive magnets. A bridge assembly is provided for retaining magnet assembly 60 and moving coil assembly 1 within yoke 6. To assemble the complete structure, magnet assembly 60 is inserted into the moving coil assembly, comprised of frame 10, balance cross 16 and counterbalance arm 44 and the upper and lower hubs 14 and 54. The combined moving coil and magnet assembly, shown at 80 in Figures 1 and 2, is inserted into the bottom support assembly 4 of Figure 1. The bottom support assembly includes a bottom bridge structure 82, which comprises a U shaped element having a pair of upstanding arms 84. Each arm 84 includes a lip 86 providing a rest for bottom support plate 68 of magnet assembly 60. A pair of locking tabs 88 are provided for passage through a pair of side notches in upper support plate 66.Once assembled, tabs 88 are bent inwardly ards each other , thereby vertically locking the magnet wsashbly between tabs 88 and 86 of bottom bridge structure 82.The inner edges of arms 84 engage the notches of support plates 66 and 68 to lock magnet assembly 60 against rotary or horizontal movement relative to the bottom bridge. The bottom support assembly further cz2rises an abutment 90, a tension spring 92, and a retainer 94. Abutment 90 is used for rearward zeroing of the meter movement. The abutment includes a recessed central portion, shown at 98, having an indented upset for receiving a mating central offset portion at a bottom cross segment 99 of bottom bridge structure 82.These two surfaces provide mating bearing and centering surfaces for operation of zeroing abutment 90. Retainer 94, preferably formed from plastic with a split vertical central portion 100, is inserted through an pening in tension spring 92, through a central opening in recessed portion 98 of abutment 90, and through a central opening 101 in the offset portion at the bottom cross 99 of bridge structure 82. The vertical portion 100 of the plastic retainer sz aps into position within central opening 101 of bottom bridge 82, thereby to lock together the bottom support assembly 4. The assembled combination of moving coil and magnet assembly 80 and bottom support assembly 4 is inserted into yoke 6, which is provided with a pair of grooves 102 for receiving the outer edges of arms 84. Positioning shoulders 104 are provided at the upper end of each of the two grooves 102 for location of the magnetic cage thereagainst Shoulders 104 provide a rest for the elongated extensions of the upper support plate 66. Having been inserted into yoke .6, and being located thereagainst by the support plate 66 and the positioning shoulders 104, the assembled combination of 4 and 80 is fixed within the yoke by staking a pair of shoulders 106, formed along arms 84 of bottom bridge structure 82, against the bottom surface of yoke 6. A tap bridge 108, shown in detail at Figure 4, is combined with an abutment 110 and a tension spring 112, with the combination fastened together by.a second split plastic retaining clamp 114, having a central split vertical portion 115, to form top bridge assembly 5. Abutment 110 provides a frontally located adjusL rit for the rest position of the meter mechanism. As shown in Figure 4, four pairs of fingers 116 are provided at the bottom of tap bridge 108 for retaining a pair of beads 118 which are used as deflection limiting bumpers for the moving coil assembly.The beads are preferably formed of ceramic material, having a low surface tension against other materials, and are dimensioned to provide a snapfit with the fingers 116. Top bridge 108 is the insulated side of the mechanism, and is preferably formed of plastic or other insulating materials. The combined top bridge assembly 5 is mounted to hub 14 of moving coil and magnet assembly 80. When so mouncedr beads 118 form horizontal bumpers for a vertical portion 119 of balance cross assembly 16, thereby providing maximum and minimum deflection limits for the moving coil element of the mechanism. Tower 32 on hub 14 projects through a central opening 120 within top bridge 108, and into vertical portion 115 of retainer 114, thereby limiting lateral movement of the moving coil and magnet assemblies in the event of vibration to the available radial clearance for tower 32. A shoulder of the horizontal portion 33 of the hub cacoarates with the bottom surface of central portion 115 of retainer 114 to limit relative vertical movement between the moving coil and magnet assemblies. A similar arrangement is provided for a bottom tower 121 in bottom hub 54 with respect to central portion 100 of retainer 94. The offset central portions of abutments 98 and 110 are staked to retain tension springs 92 and 112, respectively. These springs are thus free to. rotate on the offset bearing surfaces of the abutments. Tension springs 92 and 112 receive taut band portions 52 and 20., respectively. Rotation of the springs, such as by adjustment of abutments 98 and or 110, is used to set the moving coil to an apprapriate initial position. Top bridge 108 is provided with pairs of depending parallel plates 122, on either side thereof, formed below a nlngs 124. 30t.cm bridge structure 82 is provided with a pair of are 126, which are designed to pass through parallel plates 122 and engage openings 124 cf top bridge 108. Upon assembly of the tap bridge assembly to the bottom bridge assembly within yoke 6, arms 126 are bent outwardly in order to lock the top and bottom bridge assemblies together and to complete the assembly jof the meter mechanism. As will be appreciated, the above described structure permits automated assembly of the moving coil assembly, the magnet assembly, the bottom support assembly and the upper bridge assembly. By continuous movement in a single direction, moving coil and magnet assembly 80 may be assembled to bottom support assembly 4. Continuing assembly by movement in the same direction, top bridge assembly 5 is assembled to the bottom support assembly. The assembled components are inserted in yoke 6, again requiring movement only in the same direction previously provided, before or after canbining assemblies 80 and 4, or after combining all. of assemblies 80, 4 and 5. Three embodiments of the inventive viscous damping structure for an electrical meter are shown in detail at Figures 5A, SB and SC. As shown in Figures SA and 5B, for example, the inventive structure includes top bridge element 108, fixedly connected to the magnet assembly 60 by top bridge assembly 5 as previously described and hub 14, attached to the moving coil assembly 1. As shown in detail, retainer 114. clamps abutment 110 to top bridge element 108. The central vertical portion 115 of retainer L14 cooperates with the central tower 32 of hub 14 to limit vertical and lateral motion between the permanent magnet and moving coil assemblies. The two assemblies are connected by a taut band 20, connected at one of its ends to tension spring 112 and at its other end to balance cross 16. In order to control the mechanical vibration which may exist between the two assemblies, a viscous liquid 130, such as a silicon oil, for example, is provided within a predetermined portion 131 of central tower 32 of hub 14. Further portions 132 of the interior surface of hub 14 are coated with an anti wetting agent in order to prevent spread of liquid 130 from the damping control area formed by predetermined portion 131 of hub 14. A typical anti wetting agent may be obtained from the 3M Company under the trade name FLOORED, designated by FC 72l. A segment 134 of taut band 20 is included in the damping control area and helps define the same.Other portions of taut band 20, shown at 136 may similarly be coated with an anti wetting agent in order to prevent spread of the viscous liquid and further to assure its containment within the damping control area. As will be apparent unon reference to Figure SB, other portions of the hub component of the moving coil assembly may be used to define the damping control area. For example, shoulder surface 138 formed in the horizontal section 33 of hub 14 may define the damping control area. A drop of viscous damping liquid 130 is retained within the damping control area by provision of the anti wetting agent at further portions 140 of the hub. In the embodiment of Figure SB, the retainer 114, cooperating with hub 14, includes further predetermined portions 142 which are also used to define the damping contra area. Still further portions of retainer 114, shown at 144, may be coated with the anti wetting agent in order to confine the viscous liquid to the damping control area defined by shoulder surface 138 and the cooce rating portions 142 of abutment 114. It should be appreciated that the two eobodiments shown inFigures SA and 5B are not mutually exclusive and that the fluid coupling between the hub and the retainer shown in Figure SB may be combined with the use of damping liquid to couple taut band 20 with hub 14. As is apparent from comparison of Figures SA and 5B, central tower 32 of hub 14 may be shortened to increase the acceptable range of vibration of the meter without pointer bouncing and other adverse affects which occur when the tower bumps against the internal surfaces of retainer 114. Because such motions are damped by viscous liquid 130, the structure of Figure 5B may be provided with the shortened tower. In yet a third embodiment of the invention, shown at Figure Sc, the viscous damping is provided between the permanent magnet and the coil frame. As particularly shawl therein, a tion 46 of the horizontal support plate 66 forming the temperature coppensating shunt for the magnet defines the d ing control area.Further portions of the support plate, shown at 148, are coated with the anti wetting 2sent to retain the viscous liquid within the desired damping control area As will be noted from the figure, the predetermined portion 146 on the surface of the support plate of the permanent magnet assembly is offset by a circular notch 150 from the remainder of the surface of plate 65. The circular notch 150 is used to help define the shape of the drop of viscous liquid contacting the support plate.Although a circular notch is coined into the surface of the present embadiment, any shape may be so coined. The preferred circular notch is used to form a circular droplet and to define the drop diameter thereof. Inasmuch as the damping provided by the viscous liquid is a function of both the liquid viscosity and the coupling surface thereof, different degrees of damping may be provided by coining different sized notches into the support plate. A predetermined portion 152 of the inner surface of coil frame 10 cooperates with portion 146 of the support plate of permanent magnet assembly 60 to define the damping control area in which the viscous liquid is intended to remain. Further portions of the inner surface of the frame 10 may also be coated with the anti wetting agent in order to restrict the damping liquid to the desired area. In order further to define the shape and location of the drop of damping liquid 130, coil frame 10 may include an offset portion 154. In order to retain the advantageous ease of manufacture of the frame component 10, offset portion 154 may be provided in an extrusion by longitudinal indentations on either side of the central internal surface thereof. The viscous liquid provided in the embodiment of Figure SC provides a fluid coupling between the permanent magnet assembly and the moving coil assembly for damping out vibrations therebetween. It should be noted that in the embodiment of Figure 5C the tower portion of hub 14 is shortened still further, to avoid the tower hitting the retainer in case of extreme vibration. The hub is thus provided with greater lateral freedom of ns p i iic nt. It is recognized that, in order to provide improved readability in situations of mechanical vibration, removal of lengthened portions of the tower may provide increased vulnerab ility of the taut band to vibration. In all three embodiments of the invention, the viscosity of the damping liquid creates a damping effect for particular frequencies of vibration, whether of the taut band or of the moving coil assembly with respect to the permanent magnet assembly. The specific degree of damping may be . varied by altering the quantity or viscosity of damping fluid utilized.Such variations, however, also affect the shock absorbing features of viscous oil 130. In a high torque instrument damping may be increased both for the purpose of enhancing readability and for protection of the mechanism. In a low torque meter, however, where it may not be desirable to alter the meter response time, less viscous liquid may be used. In such an embodiment the taut band may required more protection, and accordingly a higher tower may be provided on the hub portion of the moving coil assembly.The embodiment of Figure SA is particularly well suited for such low torque meters, since the viscous liquid damps only the oscillations of the taut band and not the coupling of the stationary and moving assemblies. For higher torque meters, the embodiment of Figure SC is preferred since it is easier to control the damping than in the embodiment of Figure SB. It should further be noted that although the embodiments shown in Figures 5A, B and C relate to the upper bridge support structure, substantially identical arrangements are provided for the bottom bridge portion 82 and hub 54, with respect to Figures SA and SB, and for the bottom support plate 58 and coil frame 10 for Figure 5C. As previously mentioned any combination of the foregoing embodiments may be used in order to provide damping tailored particularly to a desired environment. The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, since many obvious modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiment described was chosen in order best to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby to enable others skilled in the art best to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are best suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto, when interpreted to obtain the full breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled.
