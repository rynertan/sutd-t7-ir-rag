# Position or movement sensor, e.g. for conveyances such as lifts.

## Abstract
A position or movement sensor responsive to movement of a mine cage 26 in a mineshaft comprises a leaky coaxial cable 12 extending along the path of the cage, and an oscillator 40 and associated circuitry 42, 44, 14 for forming an electromagnet standing wave in the cable. The cage carries a resonator 28 which moves adjacent the cable, causing a cyclical change in the cable characteristics as seen from a detector probe 30 at the top end of the cable. Detection and counting circuitry 32 detects and indicates movement of the cage by reference to the standing wave pattern.
