## Description
DC9IPTION The present invention relates generally to a safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle and more specifically to a safety device used with a remote control door opening and closing device by which the vehicle door can be opened or closed by a driver from a remote position. A remote control door for an automotive vehicle implies a vehicle door which can be opened or closed by a driver, at drivers will, when he operates a control switch disposed at a position remote from the door, irrespective of other passenger will. The remote control door is usually driven by a door driving force supplied from a power supply such as an electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic device. In such a remote control door, however, the door opening and closing remote control switch operated by the driver is disposed at a position in which it is relatively difficult to confirm the safety condition near the door or behind the vehicle. Therefore, if the remote control switch is operated by the driver by mistake to open the door, when there is another person near the door to be opened, when another vehicle is left parked near the door, or when a bicycle approaches from behind the door, there exists a problem in that an accident may occur such that the opened door hits the person or damages the vehicle, or the bicycle collides against the opened door. Further, if the remote control switch is operated by the driver by mistake to open the door, while the vehicle is travelling or still moving at a low speed, there exists a problem in that the passenger may fall out of the vehicle onto the ground or the opened door hits anotherVehicle body. A more detailed description of the prior art remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle will be made lateron in the description with reference to the attached drawings.With these problems in mind therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a safety device for a remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle by which only when the vehicle is kept parked securely, the door can be opened each time the driver operates the remote control door open switch, and further by which where the remote control door open switch is operated by the driver with the gear shift lever shifted into Park or Neutral position, the gear shift lever cannot be shifted into Drive or Low positions to drive the vehicle. To achieve the above mentioned object, the safe remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention comprises a park position detection switch or a neutral position detection switch for disenabling the door open switch and further an actuator for restricting the movement of the gear shift lever when the door open switch is turned on by the driver, in addition to the conventional remote control door openingand closing device for an automotive vehicle. The features and advantages of the safe remotecontrol door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention will be more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numeals designates corresponding elements and in which Fig. 1 is a pictorial view showing a conventional remote control door opening and closing device mounted on the inside of an automotive vehicle rear door Fig 2 is a top view illustrating a first embodiment of the safe remote control door opening andclosing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a front wind shield of an automotive vehicle as seen from a driver within a passenger compartment, illustrating the first embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a schematic circuit diagram of the first embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 5 is a pictorial view showing a second embodiment of the safe remote control door opening andclosing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a rear view of an automotive vehicle showing the second embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view taken along the lines VII VII of Fig. 6, showing a warning lamp used for the second embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 8 is a schematic circuit diagram of the second embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 9 is a front view of a gear shift lever of an automatic transmission of a third embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 10 is a cross sectional view taken along the lines X X of Fig. 9 Fig. 11 is a schematic circuit diagram of the third embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 12 is a schematic circuit diagram of a fourth embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 13 is a front view of a gear shift lever of an automatic transmission of a fifth embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 14 is a cross sectional view taken along the lines XIV XIV of Fig. 13 Fig. 15 is an enlarged plan view showing a position plate used for a gear shift lever of an automatic transmission of a sixth and a seventh embodiments of the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention and Fig. 16 is a schematic circuit diagram of the sixth and seventh embodiments according to the present invention. With reference to the attached drawings, the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotiveJ uehicle according to the present invention will be described hereinbelow. Further, in this specification, only the safe remote control device used for a rear, left side vehicle door is disclosed by way of example however, it is of course possible to adopt this safe remote control device according to the present invention for the other doors rear, right side front, left or right side of an automotive vehicle. Fig. 1 helps to illustrate the principle of a prior art remote control door opening and closing device provided on a rear left side door 3 of a vehicle 1. The remote control door device 5 mainly comprises a door openand close mechanism 9 such as a hydraulic cylinder linked between the door 3 and a vehicle body 7 for opening and closing the door 3, a driving device 11 such as a DC motor for selectively driving the open and close mechanism 9 in the normal direction or in the reverse direction, and a control circuit including two cables 13 for selectively rotating the driving device 11 clockwise or counterclockwise. Further, in Fig. 1, the reference numeral 4 denotes an unlock lever linked to the abovementioned open and close mechanism 9 for opening the door 3, the reference numeral 15 denotes a door open andclose switch including a pair of door open switch 15a and door close switch 15b connected to the control circuit 13, the reference numeral 17 denotes a battery, and the reference numeral 19 denotes an ignition switch. In the remote. control door device 5 thus constructed, when the driver selectively operates the door open and close switches 15a and 15b, the door 3 is opened or closed, respectively, in response to these switches. When the door 3 is opened by remote control, since a dodr lock and a striker both not shown engage each time the door is closed, the unlock lever 4 linked to the door open and close mechanism 9 must disengage the door lock from the striker, and then the driving device 11 can push the door 3 outward with a hinged portion 6 acting as a fulcrum, by means of the door open and close medhanism 9.Also, when the door is closed by remote control, since the door 3 moves into contact with the passenger compartment wall, the door lock and striker automatically engage and therefore the door is closed. In view of the above description, reference is now made to a first embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention. Figs. 2, 3 and 4 show a first embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention. The door open and close switch 15 is disposed near two lines Q1 and Q2 connecting between the left side eye Ei of the driver N and the inside edge of an outside rear view mirror 21 and between the right side eye E2 of the driver M and the outside edge of the outside rear view mirror 21. Further this door switch 15 is fixed on an instrument panel 23 within the passenger compartment. In the mirror surface 21a of the above mentioned outside rear view mirror 21, since there is reflected the surrounding state near the door 3 or behind the vehicle 1, which is defined by two lines Q3 and Q4, when the driver X turns his eyes E upon the door open and close switch 15 disposed at the position described above in order to open or close the door 3, it is possible for the driver to look the mirror surface 21a of the outside rear view mirror 21, without moving his head or his eyes. Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of a front windshield as seen from the eyes E of the driver M, which clearly shows that the mirror surface 21a of the outside rear view mirror 21 exists on an extension line connecting between the door open and close switch 15 and the eyes E of the driver. Further, in this embodiment, it is desirable that the door open and close switch 15 is mounted within a range defined by the two lines Q5 and Q6 as depicted inFig. 2 and on the top surface or the vertical surface near the top of the instrument panel 23 of the vehicle 1. Fig. 4 shows a circuit diagram of the first embodiment of the safe remote control door opening andclosing device according to the present invention. In the figure, the ignition switch 19 connected to the battery 17 is connected to the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11 via the door open switch 15a of the door open and close switch 15, and to the reverse revolution terminal llb of the driving device 11 via the door close switch 15b. Further, the reference numeral 25 denotes a door open and close stopper switch which is usually turned off when the door 3 is fully opened or closed. Now follows a description of the operation of the above first embodiment according to the present invention, with reference to the figures including Fig. 4. When the driver M looksatthedoor open and close switch 15 disposed on the instrument panel 23 in order to operate the switch 15 for opening or closing the door 3, since the driver can automatically look into the mirror surface 21a of the outside rear view mirror 21 in which there is reflected the surrounding condition near the door 3 or behind the vehicle 1, the mirror 21 comes into the driver s field of vision. Therefore, it is possible for the driver to depress the door open and close switch after having confirmed the surrounding condition near the door 3 or behind the vehicle 1, that is, the safety around the vehicle. When the door open switch 15a is turned on by the driver after he has confirmed the safety around the vehicle, if the ignition switch 19 is on , a current is supplied to the normal revolution terminal Ila of the driving unit 11, thus the door 3 is opened safely by means of the door open and close mechanism 9. In the same way, when the door close switch 15b is turned on by the driver, a current is supplied to the reverse revolution terminal llb of the driving unit 11, thus the door 3 is closed by means of the door open and close mechanism 9. Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 show a second embodiment of the safe door opening and closing device for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention. The door openand close switch 15 is disposed near the drivers side as in the case of the first embodiment however, in this second embodiment the door open and close switch 15 is disposed on the rear, middle portion of the rear door inner panel 41. Xn the same way as in the first embodiment, when the passenger operates the door open and close switch 15 in order to open the door 3, an unlock lever not shown linked to the door open and close mechanism 9 operates, so that a door lock and a striker both not shown disengage and the door 3 is pushed outward by the driving device 11 by means of the door open and close mechanism 9 with the hinged portion 6 acting as a fulcrum. Also, when the door 3 is closed, since the door 3 moves into contact with the passenger compartment wall, the door lock and the striker automatically engage and therefore, the door is locked. In the second embodiment according to the present invention, since the door open and close switch 15 is disposed on the inside of the door 3, the passenger can automatically turn his eyes toward the outside view of the door 3 and the rearside view of the vehicle each time the passenger operates the door open and close switch 15. Further, as depicted in Figs. 6 and 7, on the rearward end surface of the inner panel 41 and on the inside surface of the outer panel 43, there is disposed an alarm device 45 such as an alarm lamp 49 which is activated each time the door open and close switch 15 is operated to open the door 3. An alarm lamp 49 of this alarm device 45 is mounted in a recess 47 formed in the rearward end portion of the inner panel 41, being connected in parallel with the driving device 11. Further, on this recess 47, a lens 51 is mounted in such a way that the door 3 can be opened or closed freely and also the alarm light can be noticed from behind the vehicle. As shown in Fig. 8, the control circuit 13 is connected between the ignition switch 19 connected to the battery 17 and the driving device 11 having a normal revolution terminal lla and a reverse revolution terminal llb, to which the door open and close switch 15 having a door open contact 15a and a door close contact 15b is connected. Further, one terminal of the above mentioned alarm lamp 49 is connected to a point between the door open contact 15a of the door open and close switch 15 and the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11, and the other terminal of the alarm lamp 49 is grounded. Now follows a description of the operation of the second embodiment according to the present invention. When a passenger wants to open the door 3, he turns his eyes upon the door open and close switch 15 to operate the switch 15. Therefore, he can easily look the surrounding condition near the door and behind the vehicle, thus the passenger can operate the door open and close switch 15 after he has confirmed the safety around the vehicle each time the door 3 is opened by the passenger. Further, since the alarm lamp 49 disposed on the rearward end surface of the door comes on the instant that the door open switch 15a of the door open and close switch 15 is turned on, it is possible to inform another person or another driver approaching from behind the vehicle that the door is being opened or opened, thus preventing an accident such that a bicycle collides against the opened door. Fig. 9, 10 and 11 show a third embodiment of the safe remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention. The gist of this third embodiment according to the present invention is to connect a park position detection switch 59 which is closed only when the vehicle is kept parked, in order to open the door 3 only when the vehicle is kept parked, that is, only when the park position detection switch 59 detects that a gear shift lever 51 of an automatic transmission is in the park position P. The park position detection switch 59 is mounted on a bracket 57 shown in Fig. 9 attached to a lever bracket 55 for supporting a gear shift lever 51. In Fig. 10, the reference numeral 61 denotes a position plate in which there are formed various cutouts such as Park position P, Reverse position R, Neutral position N, Drive position D, First Low position L1, and Second Low position L21 the reference numeral 63 denotes a position pin which is shifted into each cutout formed in the position plate 61. As shown in Fig. 11, the above mentioned park position detection switch 59 is connected in series between the door open switch 15a of the door open and close switch 15 and the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11. Now follows a description of the operations of this third embodiment according to the present invention. When the vehicle 1 is stopped and the gear shift lever 51 is securely shifted into the Park position P, since the cutout for the Park position P is formed on the extreme side in the position plate 61, the contact 59a of the park position detection switch 59 fixed on the side portion of the gear shift lever 51 shown in Fig. 9 is closed by the gear shift lever 51. Therefore, when the door open switch 15a of the door open and close switch 15 is closed to open the door with the park position detection switch kept turned on, a circuit is formed from the battery 17, through the ignition switch 19, the door open contact 15a of the door open andclose switch 15, the contact 59a of the detection switch 59, the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11 and the door open and close stopper switch, to the ground, so that the door 3 is opened by means of the door open and close mechanism 9. Further, in the case where the door 3 is closed, another circuit is formed in the same way as described above, omitting the park position detection switch 59. Next, while the vehicle 1 is travelling that is, when the position pin 61 of the gear shift lever 51 is in, for instance, the Drive position D, since the contact 59a of the park position detection switch 59 is kept open, a circuit is not formed in the electric circuit 13, so that the door 3 cannot be opened even if the door open and close switch 15 is closed, thus preventing the door 3 from being opened while the vehicle is travelling. In the above embodiment, the park position detection switch 59 is used for preventing the door 3 from being opened while the vehicle is travelling however, it is also possible to use a neutral position detection switch 59 , which is closed only when the gear shift lever is securely shifted to the Neutral position, in place of the Park position detection switch 59. Since the structure and its operations of the safe remote control door opening and closing device, in which the Neutral position detection switch 59 is disposed, are quite the same as in the Park position detection switch, the description thereof is omitted herein. Fig. 12 shows a fourth embodiment according to the present invention, in which a contact 71a of a vehicle speed detection switch 71 is further connected in series between the park position detection switch 59 and the normal revolution terminal lia of the driving device 11. The contact 71a of this vehicle speed detection switch 71 is closed only when the vehicle 1 stops and is opened when the vehicle is travelling even at a small speed. In this embodiment, since the detection switch 59 and the vehicle speed detection switch 71 are both used together in the electric circuit 13, it is possible to more reliably improve the safety of the remotecontrol door opening and closing device. That is to say, the vehicle door 3 can be opened by the driver from remote position only when the gear shift lever is shifted into thePark position and the vehicle stops. Further, since the automatic transmission is so designed that the park gear is mechanically locked in the automatic transmission when the gear shift lever is shifted in the park position and that the gear shift lever will not be shifted to the Park position while the vehicle is travelling because the gears may be damaged , it is possible to improve the safety the more reliably. Next, Figs. 13 and 14 show a fifth embodiment of the remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention, in which the park position detection switch 59 is fixed on the side surface of the gear shift lever 51 in such a way that the contact of the park position detection switch is urged toward the position pin 63 so as to be in contact with the position pin 63 of the gear shift lever 51 at all times. Therefore, the contact 59a of the detection switch 59 is closed or opened by the up and down movement of the position pin 63. In this embodiment, since the cutout of the Park position P formed in the position plate 61 is formed most deeply compared with those of other positions, the contact 59a of the detection switch 59 is closed only when the position pin 63 is engaged into the cutout of the Park position P. Therefore, in the same way as in the third embodiment, the door 3 can be opened only when the vehicle is kept stopped securely. Further, since the same electric circuit 13 of the third embodiment shown in Fig. 11 can be used for this fifth embodiment, the description of the structure and the operations is omitted herein. Further, in the above mentioned third, fourth and fifth embodiments, although the Park position of the automatic transmission is detected, it is also possible to use a park brake detection switch for detecting that a park brake lever is securely shifted so as to apply a braking force to the vehicle. Figs. 15 and 16 show sixth and seventh embodiments of the safe remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention. In Fig. 15, the reference numeral 61 denotes a position plate disposed at the lower portion of a gear shift lever not shown of an automatic transmission, which is formed with the Park position P, Reverse position R, Neutral position N, Drive position D, First Low position L1, and Second Low position L2 within a cutout 61a. A position pin 63 of the gear shift lever is selectively engaged with this cutout 6la. Also, between the Park position P and the Reverse position P in the position plate 61, there is disposed a first actuator 75 in order to prevent the position pin 63 of the gear shift lever from being shifted from the Park position to the other ranges of Reverse position R, Neutral position, Drive position, and Low positions. This first actuator 75 comprises a first solenoid 77 and a first plunger 79 which projects toward a separating surface 62 formed between Park position and Reverse position so as to obstruct the passage between the Park position and the Reverse position against the elastic force of a spring 77a when the solenoid 77 is energized. As shown in Fig. 16, the first actuator 75 is connected to a point between the park position detection switch 59 and the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11 in parallel to the driving device 11. In the same way as already described, this park position detection switch 59 is closed only when the position pin 63 of the gear shift lever is in the Park position. Further, in this embodiment, it is also possible to dispose the first actuator 75 in a control cable system connecting between the gear shift lever and the automatic transmission in order to lock the cable so as not to be shifted from the Park position to the other positions. Now follows a description of the operation of the sixth embodiment. In the case where the gear shift lever is securely shifted into the Park position P and therefore the position pin 63 is in the Park position, the park position detection switch 59 is on. Therefore, when the door open contact 15a of the door open and close switch 15 is closed to open the door 3, since a circuit is formed from the battery 17, through the ignition switch 19, the door open contact 1Sa of the door open and close switch 15, the park position detection switch 59, the normal revolution terminal lla of the driving device 11, and the stopper switch 37, to the ground, the driving device 11 is driven to open the door 3. In the same way, since another circuit is formed from the park position detection switch 59 to the ground through the first solenoid 77 of the first actuator 75, the actuator 75 is energized to push the fist plunger 79 outward so as to obstruct the passage between the Park position and the Reverse position within the cutout 61a against the elastic force of the spring 77a. As a result of this, the door 3 can be opened when the position pin 63 is in the Park position but, even if the driver wants to start the vehicle 1 while the door is being opened, since it is impossible to change the position pin 63 of the gear shift lever to the positions other than the Park position, the vehicle 1 is prevented from being started, thus improving the safety of the remote control door opening and closing device. Further, in this embodiment, if there is provided an alarm device 58 such as a lamp or a buzzer which is activated by an alarm switch 60 when the gear shift lever not shown is shifted to the positions other than the Park position or the Neutral position, it is possible to inform the driver of a dangerous state that the vehicle is shifted to the travel ranges while the door is being opened. In this case, the alarm switch 60 and the alarm device are connected in series between a point between the door open contact 15a and the park or neutral detection switch 59 or 59 and the ground, as depicted in Fig. 16. Next, will be described the seventh embodiment according to the present invention. As depicted by the phantom lines in Fig. 15, by disposing second and third actuator plungers 79 and 79 on both the sides of the Neutral position N within the cutout 61a of the position plate 61, it is possible to prevent the gear shift lever from being shifted from the Neutral position N to the travel range of the Drive position D or the Reverse position R. In this embodiment, a neutral position detection switch 59 is connected in place of the park position detection switch 59 as shown in Fig. 16. Therefore, the door 3 can be opened only when the gear shift lever is in the Neutral position N. The two second and third actuators 75 and 75 are both connected in parallel with the driving device 11 between a point between the neutral position detection switch 59 and the normal revolution terminal lla and the ground, so that two plungers 79 and 79 can project within the cutout 61a at the same time so as to obstruct two passages on both sides of the Neutral position. Further in this embodiment, since the case where the gear shift lever is changed from the Neutral position to the Reverse position is relatively rare, it is possible to omit the third actuator 75 , that is, to dispose only the second actuator 751 in order to restrict the movement of the gear shift lever from the Neutral position to the travel ranges of the Drive position D and the Low positions L1 and L2. In this case, it is also possible to omit the neutral position detection switch 59 and to connect the second actuator 75 directly to the door open contact 15a. The above mentioned third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh embodiments according to the present invention have been described taking the case where the safe remote control door opening and closing device is controlled by the gear shift lever used for an automatic transmission however, it is of course possible to control the safe remote control door opening and closing device according to the present invention on the basis of the movement of the gear shift lever used for a manual transmission. As described above, since the park brake operation is detected by the park position detection switch connected in series with the door open and close switch and the door is controlled so as to be opened only when the vehicle is securely kept parked, the door cannot be opened while the vehicle is moving, thus improving the safety of the remote control door opening and closing device. Further, since at least one actuator connected to the door open contact of the door open and close switch in parallel with the door driving device is activated when the driver operates the door open switch, the gear shift lever of the automatic transmission cannot be shifted from the Park position or the Neutral position to the travel ranges of the Drive position D and the Low positions L1 and L2 while the door is being opened, thus securing the safety of the remote control door opening and closing device the more rel
