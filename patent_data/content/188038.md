# Process for producing silicon aluminum oxynitride.

## Abstract
A process for producing a refractory material comprising essentially beta SiAION wherein initial reactants compris ing Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ are nitrided for sufficient times and temperatures to convert at least a portion of the initial reactants to at least a portion of effective reactants and the effective reactants are then further heated to produce an essentially beta SiAION refractory material.
