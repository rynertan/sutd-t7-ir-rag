# Electricity meters.

## Abstract
An electricity meter for metering the amount of electri cal energy supplied by a power supplier to a power con sumer is provided with means for detecting the presence of an external shunt which has been connected to by pass its internal current sensing means 22 . The detecting means comprises means for injecting a reference signal with a generator 84 whose frequency is different from that of the AC power signal into the current sensing means 22 , and means for monitoring the signal produced by the reference signal in the current sensing means for changes indicating the presence of such a shunt. The detecting means is arrang ed to operate a circuit breaker, and or to compensate the energy measurement of the meter, and or to provide a warning to the supplier.
