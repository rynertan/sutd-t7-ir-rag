## Description
HEAT STABILI2ERS FOR HALOGENATED RESINS IR 2548 BACKGROUND As is well known to those skilled in the art, various halogen containing resins, particularly vinyl halide polymers which include homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride degrade when subjected to heat over an extended period of time as evidenced by darkening of the resin and by an increase in brittleness. These defects may render the resin unsuitable for many uses since the darkening produces an unsightly appearance, and the increased brittleness may cause mechanical failures. The use of sulfur containing organotin compounds as heat stabilizers for halogen containing resins is well known in the art. U.S. Patent No. 4,115,352 dated September 19, 1978, and incorporated herein by reference discloses and claims a composition of matter of a mixture of a an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a mercaptan or mercapto acid and b a sulfur containing organotin compound having aEMI2.1 group, or a sulfur containing antimony compound having aEMI2.2 group, said mixture having a weight ratio of a to b ranging between about 0.05 1 and about 3 1 which composition is particularly effective for such purposes. The present invention provides an improved composition over that described in U.S. 4,115,352 wherein the composition includes either i a sulfur bridged organotin mercaptide or ii a combination of at least one organotin sulfide and at least one organotin mercaptide is present in place of b above. STATEMENT OF mE INVENTION The present invention provides a novel and useful stabilizer composition of matter comprising a mixture of a an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a mercaptan or mercapto acid and b either i a sulfur bridged organotin mercaptide or ii a combination of at least oneorganotin sulfide and at least one organotin mercaptide having aEMI2.3 group, said composition having a weight ratio of a to b ranging between about 0.05 1 and about 3 1, with the proviso that up to about 99.5 by weight of the organotin sulfide identified above can be replaced by c at least one organotin mercaptide and with the further proviso that up to 96 by weight of a can be replaced by d an overbaFed organic complex of an alkali or alkaline earth metal base. All the components of the claimed composition not disclosed in U.S. 4,115,352 referred to above are old in the art and the methods of preparing them are well known. For instance, organotin mercaptides having a sulfur bridge linking two tin atoms and use of such materials as heat stabilizers for polyvinyl chloride are disclosed in U.S.3,565,930, 3,565,93T, 3,869,487, 4,062,881, 4,120,845, 4,124,618 and 4,181,671. The particular sulfur bridged organotin mercaptides, which are operable in the present invention, however, are described by the following formula EMI3.1 wherein a and b are independently either 1 or 2 R1 and R3 are hydrocarbon radicals having 1 18 carbon atoms and selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, mixed alkyl aryl and said hydrocarbon radicals optionally having substituents selected from the groups consisting of S CN, OR EMI3.2 where R5 is a 1 20 carbon atom alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or mixed alkyl aryl group R2 and R4 are hydrocarbon radicals e.g. alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or mixed alkyl aryl of 1 22 carbon atoms optionally substituted by halogen, XH,EMI4.1 where R5 is as defined above and both X and Y are independently selected from oxygen 0 and sulfur S and m ranges from 1 to about 10.

The stabilizer composition of the present invention is useful as a component of a halogenated resin to provide stability against deterioration of the resin by heat the stabilizer component can be used over a range of about 0.05 to about 10 phr that is, parts by weight per 100 parts of halogenated resin . The preferred range is about 0.25 to about 5.0 phr. The chemical nature of the halogened resin is not critical and typical suitable embodiments are disclosed in U.S. 4,115,352. Preferably the resin is a vinyl halide resin, specifically, a vinyl chloride resin.

Example II Parts Stabilizer Components 1.0 sulfur bridged organotin compound XI 0.25 alkaline earth metal salt of mercaptan 11 0.25 overbased organic complex No failure of the test composition was observed employing the above components for 28 minutes.
