## Description
POLYMORPHS This invention relates to three polymorphic forms of 5 3 2 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl guanidino pyrazol l yl valeramide, two of which are practically crystallographically pure, and to processes for their manufacture. The compound 5 E3 2 E2,2,2 trifluoroetbyl guanidino pyrazol l yl valeramide is a histamine H 2 receptor antagonist whose preparation and antagonist activity are described in European Patent PublicationNo.60094. The compound is conveniently referred to by the code number ICI 162846. It has now been discovered that ICI 162846 exists in three polymorphic forms, and that two of these can be obtained in a practically pure crystallographic form by employing suitable techniques of recrystallisation. The polymorphic forms are conveniently referred to as ICI 162846 polymorph A, ICI 162846 polymorph B and ICI 162846 polymorph C. Each of forms A and B has an advantage over the others. Thus polymorph B forms larger crystals which are extremely easy to isolate by filtration.Polymorph A forms smaller crystals which are however still easy to isolate by filtration because of their ability to aggregate. In addition, polymorph A is more crystallographically stable than polymorph B or C, and as a result it is easier to obtain and identify as chemically and crystallographically pure. For these reasons polymorph A is preferred. According to this invention there is providedICI 162846 polymorph A having a crystallographic purity of at least 908 and which is characterised by an attenuated total reflection ATR infra red spectrum having bands at 1685 ms , 1560 w , 1540 m , 1455 w , 1060 mw , 832 m , 788 w and 365 m cm Ãš. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided ICI 162846 polymorph B having a crystallographic purity of at least 90 and which is characterised by an attenuated total reflection ATR infra red spectrum having bands at 1665 ms , 1550 s , 1445 m , 1360 w , 1215 mw , 1070 w , 1050 mw , 990 w , 935 w , 822 m , 380 m and 350 mw cm l. The purity threshold of 90 refers to the fact that no more than 108 of the other two polymorphic forms is present. Thepreferred purity threshold is 95 . It is also to be understood that the contractions s, ms, Zn, mw and w are well known to infra red spectroscopists and have the following meanings relating to the intensity of any one band s strong ms medium strong m medium mw medium weak w weak A band which is particularly useful for characterising ICI 162846 polymorph A is that at 1685 cm 1 and a band which is particularly useful for characterising polymorph B is that at 1665 cm l. The two polymorphs may also be differentiated by means of their X ray powder diffraction patterns, as shown in the following table.

According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for preparing ICI 162846 polymorph A having a crystallographic purity of at least 90 , and having the ATR infra red spectrum given above, from ICI 162846 polymorph B or from a mixture of ICI 162846 polymorph A and ICI 162846 polymorph B. The process is characterised by a heating the starting material in a diluent at or above a temperature of 107 C b recrystallising the starting material from a solution in a solvent in which crystallisation begins above 65 C., and at a cooling rate slower than 1 C. minute c dissolving the starting material in a boiling solution of ethyl acetate and seeding with a crystal of ICI 162846 polymorph A at about 670C. In process a the diluent must, of course, have a boiling point at or above 1070C. at ambient pressure. Suitable diluents are, for example, toluene, xylene, anisole, chlorobenzene and diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether and mixtures of any two of these.A preferred diluent is toluene. In process b suitable solvents are, for example, n butanol, isobutanol, amyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone, and mixtures of any of these with toluene, xylene, anisole, chlorobenzene and diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether. The preferred solvent is toluene n butanol. The preferred rate of cooling the solution is 10 C. hour. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for preparing ICI 162846 polymorph B having a crystallographic purity of at least 90 , and having the ATR infra red spectrum given above, from ICI 162846 polymorph A or from a mixture of ICI 162846 polymorph A and ICI 162846 polymorph B characterised by recrystallising the starting material from water and seeding the solution with a crystal of ICI 162846 polymorph B in the temperature range 27 37 C. It is preferable to add sufficient NaOH to the water to remove any corresponding carboxylic acid impurity. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for preparing ICI 162846 polymorph A having a crystallographic purity of at least 90 , and having the ATR infra red spectrum given above, from a mixture containing ICI 162846 polymorph C characterised by dissolving the starting material in a solvent in which crystallisation begins above 65 C., treating this solution with an insoluble base, removing the insoluble base and allowing the solution to cool at a rate slower than 1 C. minute. The insoluble base must of course be removed before crystallisation begins. A suitable solvent for the starting material is, for example, one of those listed above for use in the preparation of polymorph A from polymorph B. The preferred solvent is toluene nbutanol. The insoluble base may be, for example, an inorganic base such as calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide or potassium carbonate. The preferred base is calcium hydroxide. The preferred rate of cooling of the solution is 10 C. hour. ICI 162846 polymorph A or ICI 162846 polymorphB may be used in the form of a pharmaceutical composition which comprises polymorph A or B in association with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such a composition may be in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or topical administration for which purposes it may be formulated into tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders, suppositories, sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspensions, gels, creams or ointments. In addition the pharmaceutical composition may also contain, or be co administered with, one or more known drugs. A preferred pharmaceutical composition is one suitable for oral administration, for example a tablet or capsule which contains between 2 mg. and 25 mg. ofICI 162846 polymorph A or B. Such a pharmaceutical composition will normally be administered to man for the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity in the same general manner as that employed for cimetidine, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency of ICI 162846 polymorph A or B relative to cimetidine. Thus each patient will receive an oral dose of between 2 and 50 mg. of ICI 162846 polymorph A or B or an intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of between 1 mg. and 10 mg. of ICI 162846 polymorph A or B, the composition being administerd 1 to 4 times, and preferably once, per day. The rectal dose will be approximately the same as the oral dose.The composition may be administered less frequently when it contains an amount of ICI 162846 polymorph A or B which is a multiple of the amount which is effective when given 1 4 times per day. ICI 162846 may be prepared as follows Sodium hydride paste 6.16 g. of 61 w w suspension in liquid paraffin was added portionwise over 30 minutes to a solution of 3 nitropyrazole 17.4 g. in dry DMF 150 ml. with external ice cooling to maintain the temperature at 20 30eC. The mixture was stirred for 45 minutes and to the almost clear solution was added 5 bromovaleronitrile 25 g. over 30 minutes, at 25 30 C., and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours.Water 450 ml. and EtOAc 450 ml. was added and the upper layer was separated, dried MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuo to an oil which was a mixture of 5 3 nitropyrazol 1 yl valeronitrile and 5 5nitropyrazol l yl valeronitrile. The oil was divided into two 15 g. portions which were fractionated on a silica column 3.5 cm. diameter x 100 cm. long eluted at 2 atmospheres by EtOAc 60 80 C. petroleum ether 3 7 v v . The 1 5 isomer was eluted first followed by the 1 3 isomer. The 5 3 nitropyrazol 1 yl valeronitrile had m.p. 32 33 C. To a solution of 5 3 nitropyrazol l yl valeronitrile 9.16 g. in dry tetrahydrofuran 200 ml. was added 5 w w palladium on carbon 1.8 g. . The mixture was stirred at 200C. under an atmosphere of hydrogen. 3.2 Litres of hydrogen were absorbed over 4 hours. The catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to give 5 3 aminopyrazol l yl valeronitrile as an oil. To a solution of 5 3 aminopyrazol 1 yl valeronitrile 7.0 g. in acetonitrile 25 ml. was added 2,2, 2 trifluoroethylisothiocyanate 6.02 g. .After 15 minutes the solvent was evaporated in vacuo to give 5 3 E3 2, 2, 2 trifluoroethyl thioureido pyrazol l yl valeronitrile as a white cyrstalline solid, m.p. 96980C. The above thiourea 12.5 g. was dissolved in 8M ammonia in EtOB 120 ml. . Mercuric oxide 12.8 g. was added and the mixture was stirred at 20 C. for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to give 5 3 2 C2,2,2 trifluoroethyl guanidino pyrazol l yl valeronitrile as an oil. A sample of the oil was dissolved in acetone and 5 molecular equivalents of maleic acid was added.Ether was added to the resulting clear solution to produce the crystalline maleate, m.p. 123 125 . 5 C3 2 C2,2,2 Trifluoroethyllguanidino pyrazol l yl valeronitrile 13 g. was added over 10 minutes to concentrated sulphuric acid 65 ml. with stirring. The resulting solution was kept at 200C. for 18 hours then diluted with ice 300 ml. and basified to pH 9 with 10.8 N sodium hydroxide. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc 3 x 200 ml. and the extract was dried MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuo to an oil which crystallised. The crude material was recrystallised from EtOAc to give 5 C3 2 C2,2,2 trifluoroethyll guanidino pyrazol l yl valeramide, m.p. 1300C. Example 1 ICI 162846 either pure polymorph B or a mixture of polymorph A and polymorph B 1.0 g. was dissolved in a mixture of n butanol 1.0 ml. and toluene 4.0 ml. at reflux temperature 112 C. .
