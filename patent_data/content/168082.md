# Bearing system comprising two facing hydrodynamic bearings.

## Abstract
A bearing system comprises two hydrodynamic bear ings 5 and 7 by means of which two bodies 1 and 3 are rotatably supported relative to one another. Each of the bearings 5 and 7 has an inner and an outer pattern of helical grooves, which patterns in the direction of rotation for which the bearing system is inteded build up in opposite direction a pressure in lubricant. A reservoir 17 is situated between the bearings 5 and 7 and has two patterns 27 and 29 of feed grooves which pump lubricant towards the bearings 5 and 7 during operation.
