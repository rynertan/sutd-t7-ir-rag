## Description
PHENOLIC RESIN CONTAINING AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to aqueous compositions that contain phenolic resins in combination with colloidal silica, silanes and water. The invention also deals with the use of such compositions as coatings on solid substrates. This invention falls generally into the class of colloidal silica based aqueous compositions which has been developed over the past fifteen years for use on certain substrates to prevent abrasion to substrates or for corrosion protection of the substrates. There is always a need for a less expensive, more forgiving product, especially in transparent glazing applications including, for example, glazing for autos, buses and aircraft and vandal proof windows in public buildings. the synthetic organic polymers useful in these applications, namely polycarbonate and acrylic polymers are easily fabricated into articles useful for glazing, but because of their low density, they are more subject to abrasion.Further, it appears as though this class of aqueous compositions has some utility in the protection of metal substrates, especially aluminum articles, used in automotive decorative trim and aluminum articles used as decorative trim in modern homes. As indicated supra, there are many silica based aqueous compositions available in the prior art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,986,997, issued October 19, 1976 Clark discloses acidic dispersions of colloidal silica and hydroxylated silsesquioxanes in alcohol water medium which are coated on plastic substrates and heat cured to give transparent abrasion resistant coatings. Also, these silica based aqueous compositions have been modified with organic polymers in order to change the properties of the composition both as a storable liquid material and as a cured coating. For example, Miyosawa, U.S. Patent No. 4,016,129, issued April 5, 1977 describes a hawrdenable coating composition which forms a transparent, flexible, hard and non combustible coating which comprises an aqueous dispersion of silica and polyvinyl alcohol as a complex prepared by the reaction between colloidal silica dispersions and polyvinyl alcohol at a temperature of about 500C. The reaction is allegedly accelerated by the presence of di or trialkoxysilanes. These coatings appear to have less abrasion resistance than the inventive compositions. Also, Miyosawa, in United States PatentNo. 4,330,446, issued May 18, 1982, describes a coating composition for metal surface treatment which contains colloidal silica, silane and organic polymer resins such as acrylics, alkyds, polyesters and epoxy esters. These coatings when tested had low abrasion resistance and most were not clear coatings. Nason, in U.S Patent o, 2,182,208, issuedDecember 5, 1939, describes the preparation of a silicone modified non aqueous phenolic resin by heating silicon esters or halides with phenol and formaldehyde in benzene.The benzene and by produced alcohol were distilled away at reduced pressure. The residual resin is useful as a varnish. The silicon esters and silicon halides used were Si oR 4 and SiX a respectively, where R is alkyl, R iS alkyl or aryl, X is halogen and a is the number of halogen atoms. A similar non aqueous composition is described by Martin et al. in U.S. Patent No. 2,707,191, issued April 26, 1955. These compositions comprise the condensation reaction product of methylol benzene compounds and hydrolyzable silanes. This material, in a solvent solution, i.e. toluene, could be heat cured to a hard tack free film. This invention deals with a composition of matter which is an aqueous composition comprising A a phenolic resin B colloidal silica C a partial condensate, or a mixture of partial condensates, from silanes having the general formula RSi OR 3 wherein R is methyl or ethyl and R is independently selected from a group consisting of i alkyl radicals having 1 to 3 inclusive carbon atoms ii the CH2 CH radical iii the C H radical iv substituted alkyl radicals having the formulae a CH2CH2CH2NH2 b cH2CH2CH2NHCH2CE2NH2 c CH2CH2CH2SH d CH2CH2CH2Cl EMI3.1 g CH2CH2CF3 and, D water. This invention further deals with the use of the novel compositions to coat solid substrates to render the substrates abrasion resistant and or corrosion resistant. In accordance with this invention, therefore, there is provided an aqueous composition comprising an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica and or a solution of a partial condensate of a silanol of the formula RSI OH 3, or mixtures of RSi OH , which are derived from silanes having the formula RSi OR 3 wherein R is methyl or ethyl and in which R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, the vinyl radical, the phenyl radical, the 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl radical, the gamma glycidoxy radical, the garnma methacryloxypropyl radical, the chloropropyl. radical, the mercapto propyl radical, the gamma aminoethyl aminopropyl radical, and the gamma aminopropyl radical and a phenolic resin. In one aspect of this invention, the non volatile portion of the composition is composed of colloidal silica, partial condensate or a mixture of partial condensates, that is, where R represents, in individual condensates, different radicals and phenolic resins. In another aspect of this invention, the non volatile portion of the composition is composed of a phenolic resin and a partial cpndensate, or mixtures of partial condensates. In still another aspect of this invention, the non volatile portion of the composition is composed of a phenolic resin and colloidal silica. A preferred embodiment of this invention is an aqueous composition comprising A 100 parts by weight phenolic resin B 1 to 100 parts by weight of colloidal silica C 1 to 100 parts by weight of a partial condensate, or a mixture of partial condensates, from silanes having the general formula RSi OR 3 wherein R is methyl or ethyl and R is independently selected from a group consisting of i alkyl radicals having 1 to 3 inclusive carbon atoms ii the CH2 CH radical iii the C H radical iv substituted alkyl radicals having the formulae a CH2CH CH2NE2 b cH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2 c CH2CH2CH2SH d CH2CH2CH2Cl EMI5.1 g CH2CH2CF3 and, D 450 to 1900 parts by weight of water. A further preferred embodiment of this invention is an aqueous composition comprising A 100 parts by weight phenolic resin B 1 to 100 parts by weight of a partial condensate, or a mixture of partial condensates, from silanes having the general formula RSi OR 3 wherein R is methyl or ethyl and R is independently selected from a group consisting of i alkyl radicals having 1 to 3 inclusive carbon atoms ii the CH2 CH radical iii the C H radical iv substituted alkyl radicals having the formulae a CH2CH2CH2NH2 b CH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2 c CH2CH2CH2SH d CH2CH2CH2Cl EMI5.2 g CH2CH2CF3 and, C 300 to 1900 parts by weight of water. Still another preferred embodiment of this invention is an aqueous composition comprising A 100 parts by weight phenolic resin B 1 to 100 parts by weight of colloidal silica and C 300 to 1900 parts by weight of water. These compositions cure to clear polymer coatings with a high crosslink density and low free volume. Thus, such coatings will exhibit abrasion resistance, solvent resistance and corrosion resistance. In that aspect of the invention where therm is present no colloidal silica, it has been found that those compositions provide good to excellent hydrochloric acid corrosion resistance on aluminum substrates when there is less than 100 parts of the partial condensate for every 100 parts of phenolic resin, for example, less that 80 parts of partial condensate for every 100 parts of phenolic resin.Also, they provide enhanced abrasion resistance on plastics when there is also present in the composition, the silsesquioxane, EMI6.1 In that aspect of this invention, where there is present no partial condensate, it has been found that those compositions provide abrasion resistance on plastic substrates and hydrochloric acid corrosion resistance on aluminum substrates when the phenolic resin is present in the amount of less than or equal to fifty percent of the coating composition and the colloidal silica constitutes fifty percent or more, by weight, of the coating composition. The type of colloidal silica of this composition is not narrowly critical but generally such colloidal silica useful in this invention is an aqueous dispersion having a particle size in the range of 5 to 150 millimicrons in diameter. These silica dispersions are prepared by methods well known in the art, and they are commercially available under such registered tradenames as Ludox manufactured byDuPont, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. and Nalcoag manufactured by Nalco Chemical Company, U.S.A. It is preferred to use colloidal silica of 10 to 30 millimicrons particle size in order to obtain dispersions having a greater stability and to provide cured coatings having superior optical properties.Included also within the definition of colloidal silica, for purposes of this invention, are those silicas produced by the hydrolysis and condensation of orthosilicates, such as tetraethylorthosilicate. The silica is dispersed in a solution of the partial condensate carried in water soluble or water miscible solvents. Under certain circumstances, it is helpful to also have present, small amounts of water immiscible solvents, such as toluene or xylene. Generally, for use in this invention, no more than ten weight percent of the solvent system should be water immiscible. The water miscible solvents of this invention are preferably lower aliphatic alcohols and the alcohol ethers, such as the CellosolveR solvents sold by the Dow Chemical Company,Midland, Michigan, USA. Most preferred are mixtures of the lower aliphatic alcohols and the alcohol ethers, for example, isopropanol IPA and butylcellosolve. Optionally, one can add other water miscible solvents such as ketones, for example, acetone.The partial condensate is generated in situ by the action of the water in the composition on the alkoxy groups of the precursor trialkoxysilanes and the subsequent condensation of the silanols that are formed upon the hydrolysis. The partial condensate can be further characterized as a siloxanol polymer having at least one silicon bonded hydroxyl group per every three SiO units.During curing, these residual hydroxyls condense to give silsesquioxanes, RSiO3 2. Suitable precursor alkoxysilanes are those having three alkoxy groups on silicon and which, for example, can be CH3Si OCH3 3, CH3Si OC2H5 3,C2H5Si OCH3 3, C2H5Si OC2H5 3, C6H5Si OCH3 ,C6H5Si OC2H5 3, CH2 CHSi OCH3 3, CH2 CHSi OC2H5 3,C3H7Si OCH3 3, C3H7Si OC2H5 3, CF3CH2CH2Si OCH3 3,CF3CH2CH2Si OC2H5 3,EMI8.1 CH30 3Si CH2 3SH, CH3O 3Si CH2 3NH CH2 2NH2 CH3O 3Si CH2 3NH2 and C2H5O 3Si CH2 3NH2. The phenolic resins useful in this invention are those which are water miscible, or those which are soluble in water miscible solvents, such as those solvents described above. Preferred for this invention are the phenolformaldehyde phenolic resins. Most preferred are theNovolac resins. An example of a phenolic resin useful in this invention is Resinox RS7101, manufactured by theMonsanto Co., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A. The coating compositions are easily prepared by first adding trialkoxysilanes, such as RSi OCH3 3, to colloidal silica hydrosols and adjusting the pH to the desired level by addition of an organic acid. The acid can be added to either the silane or the hydrosol prior to mixing the two components provided that the mixing is done rapidly. The amount of acid necessary to obtain the desired pH will depend on the alkali metal content of the silica but is usually less than one weight percent of the composition.Alcohol is generated by hydrolysis of the alkoxy substituents of the silane, for example, hydrolysis of one mole of Si OC2H5 3 generates 3 moles of ethanol. Depending upon the percent solids desired in the final composition, additional alcohol, water or a water miscible solvent can be added. The composition should be well mixed and allowed to age for a short period of time to ensure formation of the partial condensate. The coating composition thus obtained is a clear or slightly hazy low viscosity fluid which is stable. Generally, the phenolic resins are added to the colloidal silica partial condensate after the silica and partial condensate have been mixed and homogenized, but the order of addition is not narrowly critical. Condensation catalysts can be added to the composition so that milder curing conditions can be utilized to obtain the optimum abrasion resistance or corrosion resistance in the final coating. Alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids, such as potassium formate, are one class of such catalysts. The amine carboxylates and quaternary ammonium carboxylates are another such class of catalysts. Of course the catalysts must be soluble or at least miscible in the cosolvent system. The catalysts are latent to the extent that at room temperature they do not appreciably shorten the bath life of the composition, but upon heating the catalyst dissociates and generates a catalytic species active to promote condensation, for example, an amine.Buffered catalysts can be used to avoid effects on the pH of the composition. Certain of the commercially available colloidal silica dispersions contain free alkali metal base which reacts with the organic acid during the adjustment of pH to generate the carboxylate catalysts in situ. This is particularly true when starting with a hydrosol having a pH of 8 or 9. The compositions can be catalyzed by addition of carboxylates such as dimethylamine acetate, ethanolamine acetate, dimethylaniline formate, tetraethylammonium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium formate or benzyltrimethylammonium acetate. Sulfonic acids such as toluene sulfonic acid can also be used.The amount of catalyst can be varied depending upon the desired curing condition, but at about 1.5 weight percent catalyst in the composition, the life of the resin is shortened and optical properties of the coating may be impaired. It is preferred to utilize from about 0.05 to 1 weight percent of the catalyst. To provide the greatest stability in the dispersion form while obtaining optimum properties in the cured coating, it is preferred to utilize a coating composition having a pH below about 7.5. The coating compositions of the invention can be applied to solid substrates by conventional methods such as flowing, spraying, or dipping to form a continuous surface film. Although substrates of soft plastic sheet material show the greatest improvement upon application of the coating, the composition can be applied to other substrates such as wood, metal, printed surfaces, leather, glass, ceramics and textiles.As noted above, the compositions are especially useful as coatings for dimensionally stable synthetic organic polymeric substrates in sheet or film form, such as acrylic polymers, for example, poly methylmethacrylate , polyesters, for example poly thylene terephthalate and polycarbonates, such as poly diphenylolpropane carbonate and poly diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate, polyamides, polyimides, copolymers of acrylonitrile styrene, styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers, polyvinyl chloride, butyrates, polyethylene and the like. Transparent polymeric materials coated with these compositions are useful as flat or curved enclosures, such as windows, skylights and windshields, especially for transportation equipment.Plastic lenses, such as acrylic or polycarbonate opthalmic lenses, can be coated with compositions of the invention. In certain applications requiring high optical resòlution, it may be desirable to filter the coating composition prior to applying it to the substrate. In other applications, such as corrosionresistant coatings on metals, the slight haziness less than 5 obtained by the use of certain formulations, such as those containing citric acid and sodium citrate is not detrimental and filtration is not necessary. By choice of proper formulation, including solvent, application conditions and pretreatment including the use of primers of the substrate, the coatings can be adhered to substantially all solid surfaces. A hard solvent resistant surface coating is obtained by removal of the .solvent and volatile materials. The composition will air dry to a tack free condition, but heating in the range of 50 C to 2000C is necessary to obtain condensation of the silanols in the partial condensate and cause the composition to cure.This final cure results in the formation of reaction products between the silanols of the silsesquioxanes, the colloidal silica and the carbinols of the phenolic resin which greatly enhances the integrity and abrasion and corrosion resistance of the cured film or coating The coating thickness can be varied by means of the particular application technique, but coatings of about 0.5 to 20 micron, preferably 2 to 10 micron thickness are generally used. The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the invention delineated in the claims. Films were cast from the coating compositions inExamples 1 9 on glass, polycarbonate, acrylic and aluminum substrates. Hard, clear coatings were formed and cured.The coatings on acrylic substrate were cured at 800C and the coatings on the other substrates were cured at 1100C. The curing time for all the coating was about six hours except 2 hours for coating on aluminum substrate. The cured coating was subjected to the following tests Hardness This test was performed on the coatings on glass substrates. In this test, pencil leads are employed having a varying degree of hardness corresponding to the scale 3B, 23, B, F, H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, etc. These values represent a progression in hardness. Pencil leads of increasing hardness are held ata450 angle relative to the coating as laid down on the glass substrate and moderate force is applied until the coating is removed. The hardest lead that does not remove the coating is reported as the pencil hardness.Abrasion This is a test to determine abrasion resistanceResistance A haze of the coating by subjecting the coating to circular rubbing with a Tabor abraser and measuring the difference in Haze, before and after abrading, on the Gardner haze meter. A load of 1,000 grams was used on a cs 10 calibrase wheel for 500 revolutions in each test. The results are reported in A Haze.PencilEraser Test This quick method of scratch resistance of a coating involves rubbing an ordinary pencil eraser against the coating ten times and observing the extent of scratching. The results are reported subjectively.AdhesionTest This test is to measure the adhesion of the coating to the substrate by pulling Scotch brand tape three times from a 1 8 inch crosshatched grid of the coating. The of grid squares remaining are recorded as adhesion. The substrates used here are polycarbonate and acrylic. Corrosion test againstHC1 acid Test 1 This test was performed by dipping a coated metal strip in a solution containingCuSO4. 5H2O 20 by wt. , conc. HC1 acid 10 and H2O 70 for five minutes at room temperature. The coated surface was then examined for corrosion and the results are reported subjectively.Test 2 If no damage was observed, the same dipping procedure was repeated after a thin line was scribed thru the coating onto the metal surface. The corrosion was examined in the vicinity of the scribe. The metal strips tested were aluminum. They were purchased from the Q Panel Company in Cleveland, Ohio.Test 3 A more severe test is to expose a scribed panel coated to concentrated HC1 vapor in the presence of air for 30 minutes.P.C. is polycarbonate LexaneR, manufactured by General Electric Plastics Division,Pittsfield, Mass., USA .
