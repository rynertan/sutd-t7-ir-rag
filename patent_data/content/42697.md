# A plant growing unit, and method.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a plant growing unit which is generally flexible and comprises upper and lower compartments formed of flexible polyethylene or other plastics materials. The flexible upper compartment consti tutes a plant root ball container 5 open for upward growth of a plant when placed in the container, while the flexible lower compartment constitutes a reservoir 3 for water 2 optionally containing added fertilizer nutrients or other dissolved materials. Level restricting means, such as at least one aperture 8 in the walls of the lower compartment, is provided for establishing a maximum level of water in the reservoir which in use of the unit 1 results in an air space 9 between the water level and the root ball of a plant when in the container. The unit also has one or more openings 7 between the upper and lower compartments allowing root growth from the container to the reservoir.
