# DISK REPRODUCING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
Apparatus for reproducing a disk on which have been recorded in multiplex fashion main digital data and subsidi ary digital data for selectively reproducing the main digital data. The apparatus includes means for generating a write clock synchronized with a disk reproducing signal means for generating a read clock having a predetermined period a buffer memory in relation to which the main digital data and subsidiary digital data which have been reproduced from the disk are written and read out in response to the read clock, and which effects de interleaving of the main digital data and control means adapted for finding the reproduction position of the main digital data in accordance with the subsidiary digital data read out from the buffer memory. Further, a buffer memory into which the subsidiary digital data is written may be constituted by an FIFO buffer register which is provided separately from the buffer memory.
