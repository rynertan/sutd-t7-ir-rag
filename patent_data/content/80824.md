# Thermostatic assembly.

## Abstract
An assembly having a heat expansible fluid therein and capable of expanding and contracting in response to temper ature changes between predetermined limits with a first member 12 having a front surface 14 and a rear surface 16 , with the surfaces terminating in a free end 18 . A second member 20 having a rear front surface 22 and a rear surface 24 is also provided with the surfaces terminat ing in a free end 25 . The first member 12 may include an inner section 28 , with an outer section 30 , and a central section 32 extending intermediate the inner and outer section 28, 30 . The central section 32 has a curved wall 34 extending outwardly from the rear surface 24 . The inner section 28 is adapted to expand outwardly upon the assembly being elevated in temperature which results in the expansion of the heat expansible fluid contained therein. The assembly can be designed to be fully expanded at approxi mately 85 F 29.47 C and contracted at approximately 65 F 18.35 C in an unloaded condition. The expansion tempera ture range is directly related to the application for which the assembly is utilized.
