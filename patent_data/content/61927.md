# Composite structure of an aromatic polyamide fabric coated with a fluorosilicone rubber.

## Abstract
A composite sheet structure is provided comprising an aromatic polyamide fabric 1 coated on both sides with a 2 to 30 mil thick layer of a fluorosilicone rubber 2 and having a dielectric constant of about 4 to 8 and a dissipation factor of about 0.015 to 0.030 the composite structure is useful as an insulating blanket that is used in a dielectric press to emboss laminates of thermoplastic polyurethane foam short napped synthetic velour fabric used as upholstery for automobiles and trucks.
