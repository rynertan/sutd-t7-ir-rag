## Description
GLASS FILLED POLY p METHYLSTYRENE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention is concerned with blends of poly p methylstyrene . Description of the Prior Art Insofar as is now known, the specific compositions of this invention have not been proposed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a heat stabilized composition comprising poly p methylstyrene containing between about 5 percent and about 50 percent, based upon the total weight of the composition, of short glass fibers. DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTSThe monomer used in preparing the homopolymer in accordance with this invention is p methylstyrene. It is within the contemplation of this invention to use mixtures of methylstyrene rich in p methylstyrene. Such mixtures contain at least about 90 weight percent, preferably 95 99 weight percent, p methylstyrene and less than 0.1 weight percent o methylstyrene with the balance being m methylstyrene. A typical mixture contains, by weight, about 95 percent p methylstyrene, about 5 percent m methylstyrene, and about 0.05 percent o methylstyrene. The mixtures are obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of the mixtures of ethylmethyl benzene isomers described in U.S. Patent No.4,086,287 to which reference is made. The polymers contemplated herein are p methylstyrene or p methylstyrene rich isomer mixture homopolymer or their copolymers containing between about 10 and about 1 weight percent conjugated diene, such as butadiene or isoprene. The polymerization reaction is carried out by using methods and catalysts well known in the art for polymerizing styrene. The reaction can be carried out in solution,.bulk, suspension, or emulsion. The poly p methylstyrene homo or co polymer has incorporated therein a reinforcing filler. Typical fillers include silica, glass, carbon, asbestos, mica, titanium dioxide, and calcium carbonate. Preferably, the filler is in the form of fibers, such as glass, Kevlar graphite, boron, high silica, quartz, asbestos cotton, nylon, and polyester fibers. The poly p methylstyrene more preferably has incorporated therein short glass fibers between about 3 16 inch and about 5 16 inch in length. The glass fibers are readily available commercially and often come sized with a silane. The amount of glass fibers used will be between about 5 percent and about 50 percent, preferably between about 20 percent and about 30 percent, based upon the total.weight of the composition. Blending of the poly p methylstyrene with the reinforcing fillers can be either by dry blending or by melt blending, blended in extruders, heated rolls, or other types of mixers. Other additives for appearance and property improvements can be incorporated, such as colorants, plasticizers, stabilizers, hardeners and the like. Examples 1 and 2 Using a 1 1 2 inch single screw Davis Standard extruder, poly p methylstyrene was melt compounded with 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively, 3 16 inch glass fibers. The composites were then injection molded intoASTM test specimens and evaluated. Test results are set forth in the Table. Examples 3 and 4 For comparison purposes, Examples 1 and 2 were repeated using. polystyrene instead of poly p methylstyrene . Test results are set forth in the Table.

Unexpectedly, the sensitivity to glass filling is much greater with poly p methylstyrene than with polystyrene. Although the present invention has been described with preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the appended claims.
