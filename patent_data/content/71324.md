# Method of manufacturing vent element.

## Abstract
The method of manufacturing a vent element having melt off vent pores extending therethrough in parallel with the axial direction, is for use in die casting, rubber and plastic molding, metering and supplying of fluids, and manufacture of ball point pens. One or more than two wire rods 3 of metal or ceramics or a compound material thereof having a melting point higher than that of a core rod 1 , is are wound in the form of a single or plural layer spirally around the core rod 1 to form a secondary wire rod. The secondary wire rod 3 or a bundle of plurality of said secondary wire rods is heated to a temperature which exceeds the melting point of the core rod 1 but does not melt the wire rod 3 so as to melt the core rod. The melt infiltrates into the interspaces between the wire rods and or the windings of the wire rod to form one pore at every position where the core rod existed.
