## Description
Title MODIFIED RUBBER COMPOSITION This invention relates to a modified rubber composition having excellent green strength and excellent properties after vulcanization. It is known to use a rubber having incorporated therein a polar group such as a carboxyl group, for example a rubber having maleic anhydride or glyoxal added thereto, as a rubber component for the purpose of obtaining a rubber composition having improved green strength and improved adhesion, etc. after vulcanization.Such a rubber, however, has the defect that its vulcanizate does not have sufficient strength properties because during the modification reaction, side reactions such as gellation of the rubber or a reduction in its molecular weight tend to take place. In particular, even when a polar group such as a carboxyl group is introduced into synthetic polyisoprene rubber having a structure closest to natural rubber by methods known heretofore, the modified rubber is difficult to use in tires of large sized buses and tracks, etc. because of the aforesaid defect. It is an object of this invention to provide a modified rubber composition free from these defects. According to this invention, the above object is achieved by a composition comprising a a modified rubber obtained by reacting a rubber having an unsaturated carbon linkage with an organic compound having a carboxyl group and an aldehyde group in the presence of an acid catalyst and b carbon black. This composition has excellent green strength and its vulcanization product has excellent strength properties, rebound, etc. Examples of the rubber having an unsaturated carbon linkage to be sometimes referred to as an unsaturated rubber or simply a rubber hereinafter used for the preparation of the modified rubber used in the present invention include homopolymers of conjugated dienes such as butadiene, isoprene, piperylene, 2,3 dimethylbutadiene and chloroprene, copolymers of two or more of these conjugated dienes, copolymers of these conjugated dienes with other monomers, ring opened polymers of cycloolefins such as cyclopentene and norbornene, polymers of dienes such as ethylidene norbornene and cyclopentadiene, and polyolefin rubbers such as copolymers of the aforesaid dienes and olefins.Typical examples include natural rubber hevea , guayule rubber, synthetic polyisoprene rubbers to be sometimes referred to as synthetic IR hereinafter , polybutadiene rubber to be sometimes referred to hereinafter as BR , a styrene butadiene copolymer rubber to be sometimes referred to as SBR hereinafter , a butadiene isoprene copolymer rubber, an isoprene styrene copolymer rubber, a butadiene isoprene styrene copolymer rubber, a butadiene piperylene copolymer rubber, a butadienepropylene alternate copolymer rubber, polypentenamer, an ethylene propylene diene copolymer rubber, butyl rubber, a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, a butadiene isoprene acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, polychloroprene rubber, a styrene butadiene styrene block copolymer rubber, and a styrene isoprene styrene block copolymer rubber. the rate of reaction is generally high when a homopolymer or copolymer of isoprene, a homopolymer or copolymer of piperylene and an ethylene propylene diene copolymer rubber are used. The organic compound containing a carboxyl group and an aldehyde group used in this invention is a compound containing at least one of each of these groups, and includes linear aliphatic compounds having up to about 20 carbon atoms, aromatic compounds having rings such as a benzene, naphthalene, pyridine or furane ring, and an alicyclic compound having such a ring as a cyclopentane, cyclopentene or cyclohexane ring. These compounds may, as desired, contain an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, a nitrogen atom, or a multiple bond in the molecular chains. Alternatively, the hydrogen atom in the molecule may, as desired, be substituted by a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an acyl group, a hydroxyl group, a nitrile group, an amino group, etc. if the substitution does not adversely affect the reaction. More specifically, the aliphatic compounds include glyoxylic acid, formylacetic acid, 2 formylacrylic acid, 6 formylhexanoic acid, 8 formyloctanoic acid, formylmethoxyacetic acid, 2 formylethylacetic acid, and 3 carbomethoxy propionaldehyde. The aromatic compounds include 2 , 3 or 4 carboxybenzaldehyde, 2 formyl 5acetyl benzoic acid, 2 , 3 or 4 formylphenylacetic acid, 2 formyl 5 hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3 2 formylphenyl propionic acid, 2 formylcinnamic acid, 1,8 naphthaldehyde acid, 2 , 3 or 4 formylphenoxyacetic acid, 2 formyl 4methylphenoxyacetic acid, 2 2 formylphenoxy propionic acid, 3 2 formylphenoxy propionic acid, 2 formyl l phenoxyisovaleric acid, 6 2 , 3 or 4 formylphenoxy hexanoic acid, 2 formylphenyl methoxyacetic acid, 2 , 3 or 4formylphenylthioacetic acid, l formyl 2 naphthyloxy acetic acid, 5 formyl 2 furyl thio acetic acid, 8 formyl2 oxo 2H l benzopyran 7 yl oxy acetic acid, 2 ,3 or 4carboxyphenoxyacetaldehyde, and 2 formylmethoxy phenoxyacetic acid. The alicyclic compounds include 2 or 3formylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid, 4 formyl 2 cyclopentenecarboxylic acid and 2 formylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Among these organic compounds, those having such a structure that the carboxyl group and the aldehyde group therein are easy of three dimensionally or thermodynamically approaching each other moderately in the molecule through an acid catalyst, particularly compounds having an aromatic ring in which the carboxyl group or an atomic grouping containing this group and the aldehyde group or an atomic grouping containing this group are located adjacent to each other on the ring at the ortho position when the ring is a benzene ring , are especially preferred in this invention because they lead to a high rate of reaction. Furthermore, those organic compounds having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group which contain a large amount of a non polar or a relatively weakly polar hydrocarbon moiety, or those which have a low melting point are suitable for the reaction operation because they have a high solubility in hydrocarbon solvents. The amount of the organic compound having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group is not particularly restricted. Usually, it is 0.01 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 01 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the unsaturated rubber. The acid catalyst used in the preparation of the modified rubber in the present invention is selected from protonic acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and hydrohalic acids and usually known Lewis acids. Typical examples of the Lewis acids are halides of metals or semi metals, for example halogen compounds or organic halogen compounds of elements such as Be, B, Al, Si, P,S, Ti, V, Fe, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn,Sb, Te, Ta, W, Hg, Bi and U or oxygen element combinations such as PO, SeO, So, S02 or VO, and complexes of these. Preferred acid catalysts are those which form a coordination bond with the organic compounds having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group.Especially preferred are those acid catalysts whose coordination products with the organic compounds have an orange color absorption wavelength 480 nm or a deeper color. Specific examples include BF3, CH3 2BF, BC13, A1C13, AlBr3, C2H5 AlCl2, POCl3, TiCl4, VC14, MoCl5, SnC14 CH3 SnCl3, SbC15, Tell4, TeBr4 and WC16. Of these, SnCl4, BCl3, WC16 and SbCl5 are especially suitable because they lead to a high rate of reaction and cause little sidereactions such as the gellation of the rubber. It is of course possible to use two or more species of each of the protonic acid and the Lewis acid, or to use the protonic acid in combination with the Lewis acid. There is no particular restriction on the amount of the acid catalyst used. Usually, it is 0.01 to 5 moles, preferably 0.05 to 2 moles, per mole of the organic compound having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group. The reaction for the preparation of the modified rubber in this invention is carried out usually in the presence of a suitable solvent, or in a rubber kneading machine in the absence of a solvent. Industrially, the reaction is advantageously carried out in the rubber cement after the end of the polymerization. The solvent may, for example, be an aromatic solvent such as benzene or toluene, a paraffinic solvent such as butane or hexane, or a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform or dichloroethane. Suitable solvents are those which are inert to the acid catalyst, etc. and dissolve the rubber. Solvents which have some degree of solubilizing power for the organic compound having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group or the acid catalyst are especially suitable from the viewpoint of the rate of reaction, etc., but useful solvents are not limited to these particular solvents alone. The organic compound having a carboxyl and an aldehyde group and the acid catalyst may be separately added to the reaction system, or after they are mixed in advance in which case a chemical change may occur .All of the acid catalyst may be added in the initial stage of the reaction, or it may be added portionwise or continuously during the reaction. When the reaction is carried out using a Lewis acid as a catalyst, the reaction system is preferably kept in an anhydrous condition or at a limited water content in order to maintain the activity of the catalyst and to prevent side reactions such as excessive gellation or cyclization of the rubber. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen is usually not preferred. The reaction temperature is not particularly restricted. Usually, it is 200C to 2000C, preferably OOC to 1000C. The reaction time is suitably prescribed between 10 seconds and 50 hours. When the reaction is carried out in the solvent, the addition of, for example, a large amount of alcohol or hot water can lead to the stopping of the reaction and the coagulation of the rubber. As required, the remaining acid catalyst and other materials are removed by washing, and the residue is dried to give a modified rubber. The kind of carbon black to be blended with the modified rubber obtained as above is not particularly restricted. Preferably, however, it has an average particle diameter of 10 my to 500 m. The carbon black is selected from channel black of various grades such asEPC, MPC, HPC and CC, furnace black of various grades such as SAF, ISAF, HAF, MAF, FEF, HMF, SRF, SPF, GPF,APF, FF and CF, thermal black of various grades such asFT and MT, and acetylene black. The amount of carbon black used is selected, depending upon the end use of the rubber composition, usually from 1 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 10 to 120 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the modified rubber. As desired, the composition of this invention may include ordinary rubber compounding agents such as vulcanizing agents, vulcanization accelerators, vulcanization aids, softening agents, tackifiers, fillers, reinforcing agents other than carbon black, and antioxidants. Sulfur and sulfur donors of the thiuram and thiazole series are typical vulcanizing agents.Peroxides, polyamines, metal oxides, urethan vulcanizers and resin vulcanizers can also be used as desired.Examples of the vulcanization accelerators are compounds of the sulfenamide, thiuram, thiazole, guanidine, mercaptotriazine, and aldehyde amine series. Examples of the vulcanization aids are carboxylic acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid, and metal compounds such as zinc stearate, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium hydroxide and lead carbonate. Process oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic series may be used as the softening agents, and compounds of the rosin, petroleum hydrocarbon resin, coumarone resin1 and phenol terpene resin series may be used as the tackifiers. The fillers include calcium carbonate, clay and talc. Silicic acid and its salts may be used as the reinforcing agents other than carbon black. Examples of the antioxidants are amine compounds and phenolic compounds.The aforesaid vulcanization accelerators and vulcanization aids are used mainly in the case of vulcanization with sulfur or sulfur donors. As required, the modified rubber composition of this composition may include other rubbers in a desired proportion.
