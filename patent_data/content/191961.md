# Valve device and abductor adductor device including such a valve device.

## Abstract
Device designed to exercise the inner and outer thigh and hip areas, namely, the adductor abductor muscles. The device comprises a pair of actuator means 34,36 each of which is connected by connecting means 42,44,48,50 to a separate air cylinder 46,52 . A valve system 48 is provided to adjust the amount of air within each cylinder 46,52 thus varying the amount of resistance of the exercise. The device is particularly suitable for use in the prevention and rehabili tation of groin injuries and provides for gradual stretching and restoration of the normal range of motion as well as strength. The device is simple in design, inexpensive to manufacture and is adaptable for home use. It uses no auxiliary fluid supply means as opposed to the prior art devices.
