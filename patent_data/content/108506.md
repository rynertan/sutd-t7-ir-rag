# Method and apparatus for actuating vehicle transmissions.

## Abstract
A vehicle transmission system has an internal lever for changing transmission gears, a select actuator 710 for moving the internal gear to neutral positions N1, N2, N3 in first direction, a shift actuator 720 for moving the internal lever to 1st 5th gear positions and a reverse position in second direction substantially normal to the first direction, and a clutch actuator 330 for actuating a clutch. While any one of the select actuator or the shift actuator is in operation, the pressure of a fluid discharged from the operating actuator is prevented from acting on the select actuator and or the shift actuator which is not in operation by applying a fluid pressure to the inoperative select actuator or the shift actuator to fix the actuator in a current position against operation, thereby allowing the transmission gears to be changed accurately and smoothly.
