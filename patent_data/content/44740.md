## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LOWER HYDROCARBONS AND OXYGENATED DERIVATIVES THEREOF By THE CATALYTIC CONnVERSION OF CARBON MONOXIDE AND HYDROGEN The present invention relates to a process for the production of lower hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons by the catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, hereinafter to be referred to as synthesis gas. During the past few years political and economic events affecting the petroleum industry have led to increasing interest in alternatives to petroleum as the practically exclusive source of raw materials for the petrochemical industry. In this search for alternatives there has been a resurgence of interest in the long and universally known Fisher Tropsch process whereby hydrocarbons and oxygen containing compounds are obtained from carbon monoxide and hydrogen which can be obtained from other carbonaceous deposits such as coal and natural gas. The raw materials demanded by the petrochemical industry are hydrocarbons and in particular unsaturated hydrocarbons with a chain length from C2 to C4.Unfortunately, the products obtained from theFisher Tropsch process using the cobalt and iron catalysts conventionally employed are mainly liquid and partially solid hydrocarbons having chain lengths from C6 to about Cso, oxygenated hydrocarbons and, at the most, only 30 to 50 by weight of the low molecular weight hydrocarbons of chain length C2 to C4 which are desirable in the petrochemical industry. One catalyst which has been investigated in other types of reaction is silica based material comprising crystalline silica which has been modified with one or more elements which have entered the crystalline lattice of the silica in place of silicon atoms of the silica or in the form of salts of bisilicic or polysilicic acids. Such catalysts are described in published UK Patent SpecificationNo. 2024790A. Preferred elements are said to be those having, at least partially, an amphoteric character such as chromium, beryllium, titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, zinc, zirconium, rhodium, silver, tin, antimony and boron, of which the use of beryllium, chromium, zinc, titanium, vanadium and boron are exemplified. The crystalline materials are described as catalysts for a large number of reactions, including the conversion of dimethyl ether and or methanol or other lower alcohols into hydrocarbons such as olefins.However, the list of catalytic applications does not include the production of hydrocarbons by the catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. During the course of our investigations we produced a crystalline silica modified with cobalt by mixing a source of silica, a source of cobalt, a nitrogenous base and a mineralising agent in water and maintaining the mixture under elevated temperature and pressure for a considerable period of time. After calcination the cobalt modified silica, instead of converting methanol into hydrocarbons such as ethylene, quantitatively decomposed the methanol to synthesis gas.This reaction forms the subject of our copending UK applicationNo. 8013361 BP Case No. 4964 . To our surprise, the reverse reaction, i.e. the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, produced only a small proportion of C1 to C4 oxygenated hydrocarbons which consisted mainly of methanol, but included also ethanol, and a major proportion of C1 to C4 hydrocarbons and substantially no hydrocarbons of higher carbon number. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of C1 to C4 hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives thereof which process comprises contracting synthesis gas at a temperature in the range 150 to 450oC and a pressure in the range 1 to 700 bars with a catalyst comprising the crystalline cobaltmodified silica product obtained by mixing a source of silica, a source of cobalt, a nitrogenous base and, optionally, a mineralising agent and or an inorganic base in a liquid medium comprising either water, an alcohol or a mixture thereof and maintaining the mixture under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure for a time sufficient to effect crystallisation of the product. Mixtures of the gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide are abundantly available in the form of synthesis gas. Methods for preparing synthesis gas are well known in the art and usually involve the partial oxidation of a carbonaceous substance, e.g. coal. Alternatively, synthesis gas may be prepared, for example, by the catalytic steam reforming of methane. Although it is preferred to use substantially pure synthesis gas, the presence of such impurities as carbon dioxide and nitrogen can be tolerated. On the other hand, impurities which have a deleterious effect on the reaction should be avoided. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas may vary widely.Normally the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide may be in the range from 5 1 to 1 5, preferably from 2 1 to 1 2. In general a high proportion of hydrogen favours the formation of hydrocarbons whilst a low proportion of hydrogen favours the formation cf oxygenated hydrocarbons. Methods for adjusting the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide by the so called shift reaction are well known in the art. Preferably the temperature is in the range from 200 to 4000C, even more preferably from 200 to 3000C and the pressure Lc in the range from 10 to 300 bars. The use of higher temperatures within the aforesaid ranges tends to increase the co production of methane.Because of the highly exothermic nature of the reaction the temperature requires careful control in order to prevent a runaway me thanat ion, in which methane formation increases with increasing temperature and the resulting exotherm increases the temperature still further. In fixed bed operations, temperature control may be achieved by mixing the catalyst with an inert diluent, thereby ensuring that the exothermic heat is more evenly distributed. In this way the useful life of the catalyst may be prolonged. The use of highe pressures within the aforesaid ranges tendes to increase the production rate and selectivity to C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. Although the process may be carried out batchwise it is preferably operated in a continuous manner. Suitably the contact time, as hereinafter defined, for continuous operation may be up to 30, preferably from 0.01 to 5 seconds. For the purpose of this specification the contact time is defined as Volume of catalyst in millilitres Total volume of gas in millilitres second at NTP The catalyst may be employed in the form of a fixed or a fluidised bed. The catalyst is the crystalline product obtained by mixing a source of silica, a source of cobalt, a nitrogenous base and, optionally, a mineralising agent and or an inorganic base in a liquid medium comprising water, an alcohol or a mixture thereof and maintaining the mixture under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure for a time sufficient to effect crystallisation of the mixture. Suitable sources of silica include, for examples sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silica sol and silicic acid. The preferred source of silica is an aqueous colloidal dispersion of silica particles. A suitable commercially available source of silica is LUDOX Colloidal Silica marketed by Du Pont LUDOX is aRegistered Trade Mark . Suitable sources of cobalt include the oxide, hydroxide, salts such as the nitrate and alkoxy derivatives such as the acetate. Suitable sources of nitrogenous base include amines and substituted amines such as the alkanolamines. A preferred nitrogenous base is a quaternary ammonium compound, e.g. a tetra alkylammonium compound in which the alkyl group contains from 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a tetra arylammonium compound in which the aryl group is a phenyl or an alkylphenyl group. Suitable mineralising agents include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and halides, for example LIMB, NaOH, Ca OH 2,KBr, NaBr, NaI, CaI2 and CaBr2. Suitable inorganic bases include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example NaOH, KOH and Ca 0E 2, and ammonia. The liquid medium may additionally contain an active organic species such as an alkyl halide, e.g. methly bromide, ethyl iodide or propyl bromide. The amount of nitrogenous base and or inorganic base employed may vary within wide limits. The mixture may suitably be maintained at a temperature of from 100 to 200, preferably from 120 to 2000C for a period of from a few hours to several days, preferably for about 3 days. The mixture is preferably maintained at the required temperature in a closed vessel such as an autoclave under autogenous pressure. The modified crystalline silica may suitably be separated from the liquid medium, after cooling, by filtration. After separation the silica is preferably washed to remove any exchangeable cationic impurities, preferably with boiling distilled water have dissolved therein an ammonium salt such as the nitrate or acetate. The crystalline product obtained is believed to be a crystalline silica modified by inclusion of cobalt in the crystal lattice in place of a proportion of the silicon atoms. It is preferred to calcine the crystalline product before use as a catalyst. Calcination may be effected by heating in air at a temperature in the range from 300 to 700 C, preferably at about 550 C, for a period of from 2 to 24 hours. The catalytic activity of the crystalline product may be further enhanced by the addition of one or more metals. Suitable metals which may be added include cobalt, iron, manganese, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, zinc, chromium and copper. The metals may be added either by impregnation or by ion exchange. Any of the known techniques for impregnation and ion exchange may be employed. The crystalline product may suitably contain from 0.1 to 20 , preferably from 0.2 to 10 by weight of added metal.
