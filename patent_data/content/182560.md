# SEMI TRANSFERRED ARC IN A LIQUID STABILIZED PLASMA GENERATOR AND METHOD FOR UTILIZING THE SAME

## Abstract
A plasma generator arrangement for applying material to an electrical conductive substrate and method for utilizing the same. The generator arrangement comprises a generator means 20 for creating and extending towards the substrate a plasma stream containing the material. The plasma genera tor arrangement further including means for selectively con trolling the electrical potential of the substrate relative to the generator anode so as to vary with time the extension of the plasma stream past the generator means.
