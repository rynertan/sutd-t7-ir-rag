# Apparatus for manufacturing semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A lead frame 40 is conveyed along a convey direction 2 in a convey path 10 filled with a reducing gas. A semiconductor pellet 50 is placed on the lead frame at a die bonding portion 12 . A bonding wire 80 made of copper or a copper alloy is supplied to the next wire bonding portion 14 . The lower end of the bonding wire 80 is melted with an oxyhydrogen torch surrounded by an air curtain, thereby forming a ball 82 . The bonding wire is guided into the convey path by a capillary 60 . The ball is thermocompress ed to an electrode pad 56 of the semiconductor pellet 50 . The other end of the bonding wire is fused and thermocom pressed against the outer lead 44 of the lead frame 40 at a postbonding portion 16 . The bonding wire 81 is thus looped between the semiconductor pellet 50 and the outer lead 44 .
