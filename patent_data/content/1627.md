The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations TABLET PER TABLET 3 Benzylthio 6 l hydroxyethyl 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3 2 O hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid 125 mg.Cornstarch, U.S.P. 6 mg.Dicalcium Phosphate 192 mg.Lactose, U.S.P. 190 mg.Magnesium Stearate Balance 800 mg. The active ingredient is blended with the dicalcium phosphate, lactose and about half of the cornstarch. The mixture is then granulated with 15 cornstarch paste 6 mg and rough screened. It is dried at 45 C and screened again through No. 16 screens. The balance of the cornstarch and magnesium stearate is added and the mixture is compressed into tablets, approximately 0.5 inch in diameter each weighing 800 mg.
