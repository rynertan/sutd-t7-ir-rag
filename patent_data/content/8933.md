# Accumulator conveyor.

## Abstract
An accumulator conveyor in which the articles are transported on a bed of carried rollers 12 driven by a prop elling member in the form of a cable 14 . Beneath the cable a plurality of devices 20 , arranged in tandem lengthwise of the conveyor, provide vertical support for the cable 14 . Each support has a bracket 21 pivotally mounted between its ends with a pulley 27 at one end and a tracking roller 39 at the other end. The tracking roller 39 is tapered and is mounted for rotation about a shaft 45 extending trans versely of the propelling member. The shaft 45 is longer than the roller 39 permitting the tracking roller 39 a limited amount of axial travel. By changing the angular relationship between the roller 39 and cable 14 , the point of contact between the cable 14 and tracking roller 39 is shifted lengthwise of the roller 39 , resulting in pivotal movement of the bracket 21 which raises and lowers the cable 14 to effect drive and release of the carrier rollers 12 forming the conveyor bed. Article actuated sensors shift a longitudinally extending bar 46 to control the angular position of the track ing roller 39 .
