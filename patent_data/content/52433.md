# Signal error detecting.

## Abstract
Apparatus for example for use in achieving correct field framing on reproduction of a digital PAL television signal from a video tape recorder, by correcting errors in an input square wave signal which signal alternates between first and second levels every four fields of the television signal, the apparatus comprising first and second similar counters 20, 23 and 22, 28 to be supplied with the input signal so as to be enabled to count when the input signal is of the first and said second level respectively, means 10 to detect errors in the input signal and thereupon to supply a signal to disable both the first and second counters 20, 23 and 22, 28, a clock pulse source 31 for supplying a clock pulse signal of high frequency relative to the frequency of the input signal to the first and second counter 20, 23 and 22, 28, and a bistable circuit 25 arranged to be triggered to a first stable condition by an overflow signal from the first counter 20, 23 and to a second stable condition by an overflow signal from the second counter 22, 28, whereby the bistable circuit 25 supplies a corrected replica of the input signal.
