# Demodulation device for multiphase PSK or multilevel QAM carrier wave.

## Abstract
In a demodulation circuit, a timing synchronizing circuit 26 generates a timing signal representing a sampling tim ing of an A D converter 19, 20 and has a timing signal gen erator 24, 25 , a polarity identification circuit and a logic cir cuit 22 . The timing signal generator 24, 25 is phase con trolled by a phase control signal and generates a timing sig nal. The polarity identification circuit 22 identifies a polar ity of a differential coefficient of the baseband signal at a sampling point of the A D converter 19, 20 and generates a polarity identification signal. Upon logic processing, the logic circuit 23 supplies to the timing signal generator 24, 25 the phase control signal representing a deviation of an actual sampling point of the baseband signal from an opti mal sampling point. A carrier asynchronism detection cir cuit 41 detects an asynchronism state of a carrier regener ating circuit 21 and supplies to the timing synchronizing circuit 26 a signal which changes its loop parameter.
