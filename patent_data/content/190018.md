## Description
Epithelial and stromal wounds can result from a number of causes, such as burns, abrasions, cuts, surgical procedures and other injuries. Long healing times for such wounds are a particular problem, and can result in complications such as infection, pain, and delayed recovery. The healing of corneal stromal wounds is a major problem. For example, stromal incisions following corneal transplantation can require from 6 to 9 months to heal, during which time the patient suffers from poor visual acuity and increased risk of infection in the wound. No agent for the promotion of wound healing, particularly corneal wound healing, is presently available for routine clinical use. It would thus be desirable to provide a method and agent for treating epithelial and stromal corneal wounds to promote their rapid healing. In particular, it would be desirable to provide such wound healing compositions in large quantities and in formulations suitable for clinical treatment. Various agents have been studied for possible use in the treatment of corneal stromal incisions. Parenterally administered ascorbate vitamin C was applied topically to full thickness incisions in rabbit corneas, but failed to provide increased tensile strength during the healing. Pfister et al. 1981 Invest. Ophthalmol. 21 80 86. Topical administration of mesodermal growth factor, a partially purified protein prepared from the submandibular glands of mice, appeared to activate stromal fibroblasts in the region of partial thickness incisions in rabbit corneas. Rich et al. 1979 Arch. Ophthalmol. 97 1326 1330. Epidermal growth factor purified from mouse submandibular gland was shown to increase the tensile strength of full thickness incisions in rabbit corneas. Brightwell et al., in an oral presentation at the 13th Biennial Corneal Research Conference, Boston, Massachusetts, September 23, 1983. Various studies have examined the use of mouse epidermal growth factor in treating cutaneous wounds. Greaves 1980 Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 5 101 103, applied mouse EGF on blister wounds on human subjects. The mEGF in saline solution was applied once daily until the wounds healed. No acceleration in the growth of the epidermal layer was observed. Topical application of mouse EGF to open wounds in mice has been found to promote healing in various degrees. See, e.g., Niall et al. 1982 J. Surg. Res. 33 164 169 Thornton et al. 1981 Burns 8 156 160. The hypothesis that some transformed cells produce endogenous transforming growth factors has been supported by isolation of peptide factors from transformed cells. Delarco and Todaro 1978 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 4001 4005 Roberts et al. 1982 Nature 295 417 419 Ozanne et al. 1982 Fedn.

The preparation of synthetic transforming growth factor is reported in Tam et al. 1984 Nature 309 376 378. EP A 154 434, published on 11 September 1985 discloses the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce TGF α. The first priority document of this application discloses that TGF α, in combination with TGF β, could find use for example in the therapeutic treatment of human beings. EP A 105 014 discloses a composition for the promotion of cell proliferation and tissue repair in animals having as active ingredients a TGF β which is activated by either a TGF α or EGF or both. EP A 132 021 discloses TGF polypeptides which exhibit cell growth promoting properties. The present invention relates to compositions which have utility in methods for treating epithelial and stromal wounds to promote their rapid healing. The methods utilize treatment compositions including a polypeptide having mitogenic activity analogous to that of naturally occurring transforming growth factor α TGF α obtained from transformed cells, which polypeptide is substantially free from contaminants which are naturally present with TGF α. The compositions are effective in promoting the healing of various injuries, including cutaneous wounds, corneal wounds, and injuries to the hollow, epithelial lined organs of the body. The compositions are applied topically to the affected area in physiologically acceptable carriers or bases. The present invention thus provides a composition comprising transforming growth factor α TGF α substantially free from naturally occurring contaminants and from transforming growth factor β in a physiologically acceptable carrier characterized in that the TGF α is at a concentration from 50 ng ml to 10 mg ml. In a further aspect, the invention provides such compositions for use in the treatment and promotion of healing of epithelial, stromal and corneal wounds, and the use of such compositions for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and promotion of healing of such wounds. Thus, the present invention can be used in a method for treating wounds as mentioned above, such as cutaneous wounds, and various other epithelial and stromal disruptions, such as chronic ulcers, burns, surgical incisions, traumatic wounds, and injuries to the hollow, epithelial lined organs, such as the esophagus, stomach, large and small bowels, mouth, genital, and urinary tract. The method relies on the topical application of a treatment composition including a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence and mitogenic activity analogous to that of transforming growth factor TGF obtained from transformed cells in a physiologically acceptable carrier. The polypeptide may be obtained by purification from its natural source, or by synthetic means such as solid phase synthesis techniques or recombinant DNA techniques. By topically applying the treatment composition to the wounds over a three day period, it was found that the rate of the healing process was substantially increased. Transforming growth factor TGF is a 50 amino acid polypeptide produced by various avian and mammalian cells which have been transformed by single stranded RNA retroviruses, certain human tumor cell lines, and a limited number of chemically transformed animal cell lines. TGF exists in two forms, designated TGF α and TGF β, and the physiological role for both forms is unknown at present. The amino acid sequence of TGF α is reported in Marquardt et al. 1984 Science 223 1079 1082. As used hereinafter and in the claims, transforming growth factor α or TGF α will refer to a polypeptide product which displays biological activity, particularly mitogenic activity i.e., the growth promotion of epithelial and stromal cells , analogous to that of natural transforming growth factor α protein as measured in recognized bioassays, such as those reported by Cifone and Fidler 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 1039 1043, and DeLarco and Todaro 1978 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 4001 4005. The polypeptide product will have an amino acid sequence which is the same or substantially the same as the natural protein, differing by no more than five amino acids, usually differing by three or fewer amino acids. For the most part, the TGF amino acid sequence will differ, if at all, by substitutions among the non polar amino acids, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. The deviations from the natural amino acid sequence will not significantly adversely affect the mitogenic activity of the polypeptide product or its ability to promote epithelial and stromal healing. As stated hereinbefore, the TGF polypeptide may be obtained from a natural source by suitable separation techniques, and purified to remove other proteins and substances naturally present in the source. Alternatively, the polypeptide may be produced by a synthetic technique, such as solid phase synthesis of the polypeptide, or by expression of a TGF α gene in a suitable microorganism host. Such synthetic procedures produce a product which is substantially free from naturally occurring contaminants. The TGF polypeptide may be isolated and purified from a natural source as follows. Suitable natural sources for the polypeptide include various animal cells transformed by oncogenic single stranded RNA retroviruses such as Maloney mouse sarcoma virus MSV , Abelson murine leukemia FeSV , Snyder Theilen FeSV and McDonough FeSV certain human tumor cell lines such as human metastatic melanoma cell lines A673 and A2058, as well as a limited number of chemically transformed animal cell lines. The transformed or tumor cell lines are grown to confluence in serum supplemented medium, and then transferred to serum free medium to produce a conditioned medium. The serum free conditioned medium may then be collected periodically, e.g., once a day, and clarified by continuous flow centrifugation. After concentration, the TGF α may be separated from the conditioned media by gel chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like. Alternatively, a TGF polypeptide may be prepared by conventional solid phase synthesis techniques, such as those described by Merrifield 1963 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 2149 2156. The amino acid sequence may be based on the known sequences for human and rat TGF αas follows A specific protocol for synthesizing the rTGF α polypeptide is set forth in the Experimental section hereinafter. The TGF polypeptides may also be produced by expression of a TGF α gene in a suitable microorganism host. The TGF gene may be viral DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA, or a combination thereof, e.g., synthetic DNA may be combined with the cDNA to complete the TGF α gene. Conveniently, the present invention will utilize a synthetic DNA sequence based on the amino acid sequence s of TGF α above . A suitable synthetic DNA sequence may be prepared by synthesizing single stranded DNA fragments by well known techniques, e.g., the phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage and Carruthers 1981 Tetrahedron Lett. 22 1859 1862. Complementary strands may be annealed under appropriate conditions to provide the desired double stranded synthetic gene. For expression, the TGF α gene may be incorporated in an extrachromosomal element including a replication system recognized by a desired host, typically After a suitable extrachromosomal element has been prepared, it can be used to transform an appropriate host, and the polypeptide product expressed in that host recovered and purified for use in the compositions of the present invention. Purification of the polypeptide product may be accomplished in a variety of ways, including ion exchange chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and the like. It is desired that the TGF α be greater than 70 pure, preferably at least 80 pure, more preferably at least 90 pure. The compositions of the present invention will be useful for treating a wide variety of wounds including substantially all cutaneous wounds, corneal wounds, and injuries to the epithelial lined hollow organs of the body. Wounds suitable for treatment include those resulting from trauma such as burns, abrasions and cuts, as well as from surgical procedures such as surgical incisions and skin grafting. Other conditions suitable for treatment with the compositions of the present invention include chronic conditions, such as chronic ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and other non healing trophic conditions. Compositions will find particular use in treating corneal and scleral wounds, including wounds which affect the epithelial layer, stromal layer and endothelial layer of the cornea. Treatment according to the present invention will promote cell division of the endothelial layer of the cornea. The polypeptides will be incorporated in physiologically acceptable carriers for application to the affected area. The nature of the carriers may vary widely and will depend on the intended location of application. For application to the skin, a cream or ointment base is usually preferred, suitable bases include lanolin, Silvadene Marion particularly for the treatment of burns , or Aquaphor Duke Laboratories, South Norwalk, Connecticut . If desired, it will be possible to incorporate the TGF carrier compositions in bandages and other wound dressings to provide for continuous exposure of the wound to the TGF. Aerosol applicators may also find use. For corneal treatment, the carrier will be suitable for application to the eyes. Suitable carriers include ointments, sterile saline solutions, isotonic saline solutions, such as Sorbi care Allergan Pharmaceutical , or Neodecadron Merck, Sharp and Dohme . A suitable ointment base is sold under the tradename Lacrilube . The occular carriers will normally include preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride and edetate disodium, unless they are formulated immediately prior to application. Often, it may be desirable to incorporate the TGF α in liposomes to provide for release of the TGF α over an extended period, typically from 24 to 48 hours. Such incorporation may be particularly desirable when the TGF α is incorporated into a wound dressing, as described above. The concentration of the polypeptide in the composition is from 50 µg ml to 10 mg ml, usually the polypeptide will be present between 10µg ml and 10mg ml. The compositions will be applied topically to the affected area, typically as eye drops to the eye or as creams, ointments or lotions to the skin. In the case of eyes, frequent treatment is desirable, usually being applied at intervals of 4 hours or less. On the skin, it is desirable to continually maintain the treatment composition on the affected area during the healing, with applications of the treatment composition from two to four times a day or more frequently. Optionally, the compositions of the present invention may be combined with effective amounts of anesthetics, antibiotics, antiseptics, and other drugs, typically present at about 0.001 to 2 by weight. The following experimental results are offered by way of example. The TGF α polypeptide was synthesized based on the amino acid sequence reported by Marquardt et al., The chemical synthesis of rTGF α was performed manually by the stepwise solid phase approach, following the general principles described by Merrifield, After HF treatment and before any purification, the crude and reduced synthetic rTGF α was oxidized and regenerated by the mixed disulphide method in the presence of a combination of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Ahmed et al. 1975 J. Biol. Chem. 250 8477 8482. This avoided the formation of polymeric materials during purification. The regenerated, crude rTGF α contained 40 50 of EGF radioreceptor and tyrosine specific protein kinase activities when compared with natural rTGF α. Crude synthetic rTGF α was purified to homogeneity in three steps 1 gel filtration on a BioGel P 10 column, 2 ion exchange chromatography on a CM Sephadex column and 3 preparative HPLC on a C₁₈ reverse phase column. Overall yield, based on starting loading of Ala to resin, was 31 . The purified rTGF α polypeptide was combined with isotonic 285 m osmoles sterile phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 at a concentration of 50ng ml. Totally penetrating incisions 5mm in length which extended into the anterior chamber along their entire length were made in the center corneas of adult female Macaca fasicularis primates. The right eyes served as controls and were treated three times each day with two drops of isotonic 285 m osmoles sterile phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 without rTGF α. The left eyes were treated on the same schedule with the treatment formulation described above. After three days of treatment, the strength of the wounds was quantitatively measured by inserting a small bore needle 25 gauge into the anterior chamber through the limbus of the cornea. The needle was connected to an aneroid manometer, and the pressure was slowly and steadily increased until the wounds first began to leak, and then burst. This procedure is described in detail by Weene 1983 Anal. Ophthalmol. 15 438. The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the bursting strength of TGF α treated corneas is significantly stronger than the saline treated control cornea. According to the present invention, a wound treatment composition is provided which promotes the rapid healing of epithelial and stromal wounds, including cutaneous wounds, corneal wounds, and wounds to the hollow, epithelial lined body organs. The compositions include a polypeptide product having an amino acid sequence and mitogenic activity corresponding to that of natural transforming growth factor. The compositions are found to greatly enhance the healing of full thickness incisions in the cornea.
