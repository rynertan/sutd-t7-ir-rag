# IGNITION COIL FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An ignition coil for an internal combustion engine having a secondary winding wound on a secondary bobbin. A certain number of winding turns forms a winding layer having a sloping surface of a truncated conical configuration and a plurality of winding layers are lying one upon another to form the secondary winding so that a sufficient dielectric strength between the adjacent winding turns and or winding layers can be ensured.
