# Methods and apparatus for manufacturing cutting tools.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for constructing a pressknife for cutting out sheet material such as a leather, wherein machine instructions are generated containing data relating to a desired configuration of the press knife for cutting out a particular profile, the machine instructions are supplied to a bending device 36, 38, 40 and to a strip material feed device 62 , the feed device supplies the strip material to the bending device so the bends are introduced into the strip material in accordance with the machine instructions, the formed strip material then being cut off from the stock and assembled and fixed to form the desired knife configu ration, preferably being fixed around a support plate which is produced by a forming device 30 fed with machine instructions derived from the same source 12 as those controlling the bending and feeding devices.
