## Description
This invention relates to an image readout device, and more particularly it relates to a two dimensional image readout device in which sensor elements are disposed in a two dimensional manner. In past years, MOS image sensors, CCD sensors, and contact type image sensors have been proposed as devices suitable for the read out of an image in telecopier or facsimile machines. The MOS type image sensor is a device by which incident images are scanned with an MOSIC and converted into electric signals through opto electric transducers. The CCD sensor is a device in which light induced charges at opto electric converting areas are transferred through charge coupled elements CCD . It is, however, inconvenient from functional and economical points of view to make MOS type or CCD type sensors of large area since these sensors rely upon the IC technique for buildup thereof on a monocrystalline substrate. Generally, an optical lens is used for scaling down and focusing of an image of an original onto a smaller sensor. This method has the disadvantages that the optical paths are longer because of the use of the optical lens and it is therefore difficult to reduce the machine to a compact size. To improve the above scaling down focusing type of image sensor, the contact type image sensor has been proposed which uses a sensor of the same size as the original and an optical fibre for focusing an image of the same size as the original. For the contact type image sensor, an opto electric converting area of the same dimensions as the original is necessary which requires deposit of a uniform layer of a photoconductor over a large area. An example of a one dimensioned contact type of image sensor which has been suggested has a CdS photoconductive layer divided into individual islands. This device is however complicated in structure because the photoconductive layer must be divided during manufacture and individual electrodes provided for the respective islands of the photoconductive layer. Another problem with this device is that readout speed is limited mainly due to the light response speed of the photoconductive layer. In particular, the CdS photoconductive layer is poor in light response speed and applicability of this device as a one dimensional image sensor is therefore substantially restricted. Another contact type of sensor has been proposed which has a strip shaped photoconductor using amorphous silicon. If a two dimensional image is to be read out with this type of one dimensional sensor, then the sensor will be repeatedly used and the same portion of the sensor must be supplied with a voltage in a cyclic manner for readout of signals. The current variations in response to brightness variations between light and dark , that is, rising and falling characteristics, directly affect readout signals and impose limits on readout speed. These outstanding problems must be solved for putting two dimensional image sensors into practical use. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a novel structure for a two dimensional image readout device which overcomes the foregoing problems and especially is effective not only for conventional contact type image sensors but also for two dimensional image sensors. It is also desirable to provide a two dimensional image readout device in which optical and electric scanning is carried out on working surfaces of the sensor with a minimum of electrode readout terminals. According to the invention there is provided a two dimensional readout device having an image sensor comprising an array of optical sensing regions, the sensor being arranged to produce an output representing a two dimensional image being read by the device, characterised in that said optical sensing regions are arranged in the form of a two dimensional matrix, each optical sensing region being located at the intersections of a plurality of parallel X electrodes and a plurality of parallel Y electrodes, and said device has optical scanning means presenting successive linear regions of the image to respective lines of the matrix of sensing regions in a sequential manner and means responsive to the presentation of said successive linear regions generating successive signals each representing a respective said linear image region. With this device, even if a photoconductive layer disposed between the X and Y electrodes manifests poor light response, sensor operation is not adversely affected and higher readout speed can be ensured than in the conventional one dimensional sensors. Furthermore, since a real size image is projected onto the sensor device for readout, it allows greatest flexibility for design of the electrode structure. This flexibility, combined with simplicity of structure makes it very easy to manufacture the sensor device. Thus, inexpensive two dimensional image readout devices are provided. In order that the invention may be better understood, two embodiments thereof will be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In Fig. 1 the sensor 1 comprises a substrate 2 of insulating material such as glass having substantially the same area as that of a two dimensional image to be read out, and Y electrodes 3 equally spaced in parallel by deposit of AI or the like on a surface of the substrate 2. Since the width and pitch of the respective Y electrodes 3 influences the resolution of the sensor 1, it is desirable that those dimensions be as small as possible within a range permissible according to the light output characteristics of a photoconductive layer of a predetermined thickness. There is disposed a photoconductive layer 4 over the substrate 2 having the Y electrodes 3 thereon. The photoconductive layer 4 contains a mixture, mainly of photoconductive CdS particles dispersed in resin material, overlying the whole area of a two dimensional plane on the substrate 2 with a uniform thickness. Further disposed on the photoconductive layer 4 are X electrodes 5 in a direction normal to the Y electrodes 3 with substantially the same pitch as the Y electrodes 3. To permit readout of the image, the X electrodes 5 are made up of transparent conducting material. Alternatively, if the substrate 2 is made of transparent insulating material and the Y electrodes 3 are also made of transparent electrode material, the Y electrode side of the substrate may be used as the image input side and the X electrodes 5 may be made of AI or the like. It is noted that the distance D between the X and Y electrodes sandwiching the photoconductive material 4 and the spacing L between the Y electrodes 3 are correlated as L D. In a representative example of the sensor device, L 50 µm and D 20 µm. The image is projected onto the sensor device of the above described electrode structure. A cross sectional view of the structure including the X electrode 5 and the Y electrodes Y To transfer the image onto the sensor surface, the sensor device 1 is provided with an optical system 9 as shown in Fig. 3, for example. The optical system 9 comprises a light source 11 having a reflective surface for illuminating an original 10 with focused light beams, and a fibre optic lens 12 for leading reflective light from the original 10 to the line shaped X electrodes 5 of the transparent material. Should the fibre optic lens 12 be located just above the Nth X electrode X To read out the two dimensional image of the original 10, the optical system 9 moves with respect to the original 10 and the sensor device 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the optical system 9 moves at speed V in a direction from the X₁ electrode toward the X It is well known that the photoconductive material 4 becomes conductive upon being subjected to light radiation but shows a very high resistance against the surrounding dark portion. In any event the readout operation of the sensor device 1 will not be impaired in the illustrated embodiment wherein the photoconductive layer is not divided but continuous over the whole of the two dimensional plane. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent crosstalk current due to matrix wiring if terminals other than those operative for voltage supply are connected to ground. For example, for an A4 size original a readout device having a two dimensional image sensor device of the above described structure with a density of 8 electrodes mm and an area of 320 X direction x 230 Y direction mm² and 2560 X electrodes and 1840 Y electodes, gave satisfactory image readout with good S N ratio when the optical system travelled at a speed V 250 mm sec, and the switching frequency of the Y electrodes was 4MHz. In other words an A4 original was scanned within about 1 sec. 0.5 msec line . When the terminals other than those operative for voltage supply were grounded, leakage current could be reduced to a thousandth of that when they were not grounded, resulting in S N ratio enhancement. In the case of a one dimensional sensor using the same photoconductive material, a readout time of more than 50 msec line was necessary in order to ensure the same S N ratio as with the above detailed sensor device, and image readout operation was very slow. However, in the case of the above illustrated embodiment wherein the sensor portion was designed in two dimensional manner and the image readout position of the sensor device was moved sequentially or scanned, high speed readout could be achieved without being affected by the light response characteristics of the photoconductive layer. In Fig. 4, there is illustrated a schematic view of a sensor device according to another embodiment of the present invention. Like the above embodiment, this alternative embodiment is adapted such that there are disposed Y and X electrodes running in directions normal to each other over the insulating substrate 1 with intervening photoconductive layers 4 . The difference lies in that the photoconductive layers 4 are not continuous over the whole of the two dimensional plane but independent and separate for each of the intersections of the matrix. If the Y electrodes 3 are scanned and the X electrodes are sequentially switched in this embodiment, the device can deliver image read out signals as a two dimensional image sensor. Because the photoconductive layers in respective elements are separate, there is no flow of current into the adjacent electrodes via the photoconductive layers so that the sensor device is free from the distance limitation L D as discussed with respect to the first embodiment. Similarly, if the electrodes with no voltage supplied are all grounded, then crosstalk current can be completely eliminated. In Fig. 6, there is illustrated an embodiment of the present invention in which the sensor device similarly includes a substrate 22, strip shaped X electrodes 23, a photoconductive layer 24 and Y electrodes 25 of transparent material. On the transparent Y electrode side, at least one of the n Y electrodes, for example the first electrode Y₁, is used as an electrode for selection of a particular X electrode X It is noted that the optical fibre array 30 is disposed in a straight line against the switching light source 26. The switching elements 29₂ to 29 In operation, the switching light source 26 is enabled when the optical fibre array 30 is situated above a particular electrode X Whereas the photoconductive layer is CdS in the foregoing embodiments, good readout operation is available with other materials capable of exhibiting stable photoconductive characteristics over a wide area without difficulties, such as amorphous Si, amorphous Se, Se compounds and other organic semiconductor materials. The present invention should not be limited to the contact type sensor but is applicable to conventional image readout devices with a scaling down lens.
