## Description
DIFFERENCE TECHNIQUE USING NMR MEASUREMENTS TO SCREEN FOR CANCER IN HUMAN TISSUEBackground of the Disclosure This method is intended to enhance data information obtained by NMR interrogation of human tissue, particularly with a view of locating small tumors. As set forth in a nelatefl application bearing Serial No. filed on the same day as the present disclosure, an apparatus is disclosed which enables the sequential segmented interrogation of the human breast with a particular goal of locating relatively small tumors. Enhancement of that data is important to enable small tumors to be located. It is assumed that large or qross tumors can be located by other procedures.However, early detection enhances the chance of recovery.Early detection enables less radical curative procedures to be utilized. Smaller tumors yield smaller signals. This NMR procedure thus will locate tumors with signals that are quite small. The method of this disclosure enhances the signal component traceable to the tumor, reducing the other signal components and thereby focusing on the signal component derivative from prospective tumors. In that manner, signal levels above the millivolt range can thus be obtained, and are therefore more readily located in the NMR signal to enable the output signal to be processed. This reduces the size of the minimum tumor which can be located through the procedure and method of this disclosure. Brief Description of the Drawings So that the manner in which the above recited features, advantages and objects of the present invention are attained and can he understood in detail, more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to the embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments. Fig. 1 shows a patient undergoing examination with the NMR breast test apparatus of the present disclosure Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a magnet forming a magnetic field having a field intensity defining a sensitive volume undergoing tests Fig. 3 is a schematic block diagram of the NMR test circuitry Fig. 4 shows one form of apparatus moving a magnetic field gradient so that the sensitive volume is moved over a period of time to examine the entire breast Fig. 5 is a side view of a pendulant breast showing segments of body tissue examined on different sequential tests interrogations and Fig. 6 is a graph of the difference signal as a function of breast length.Detailed Description of the Preferred Procedure This procedure contemplates the successive NMR interroqation of slices of the human tissues, particularly the female breast for the express purpose of obtaining individual signals from each slice. So to speak, a specified thickness is determined by the magnetic field gradient to thereby segment the female breast into a number of slices. Each interrogation NMR procedure obtains an output signal for each slice. The magnetic field is changed, relocating the magnetic field intensity Ho requisite to obtain a proper NMR response. Assume for purposes of discussion and description that this slice is a thickness that is more or less uniform from slice to slice and is approximately one millimeter. This is a reasonable scale e factor for the procedure described herein.That is, the slice of space within the magnetic field where the field intensity is Ho is about one millimeter thick.This slice is then relocated from test point to test point,Preferably, the slices overlap slightly. If they do not overlap, there is the possibility that a certain portion of the female breast will be overlooked and that a tumor in that area will not be observed. It is preferable to have a degree of overlap, perhaps as much as 50 . The degree of overlap is therefore typically 25 75 . Each slice is preferably thin and typically in the range of the preferred dimension of about one millimeter. This can also be varied and is dependent on a number of factors including scale factors. The above mentioned application sets forth an apparatus described in the attached drawings, and that specification is hereby incorporated by reference. That apparatus is used to obtain successive data from NMR interrogations. Each interrogation up to N interrogations is an NMR output. Each data output is utilized in detection of cancer tumors. This procedure detects hydrogen which is in the water in the various tissues undergoing examination. Water in the tissues is held by different binding mechanisms or binding phases. The binding varies and hence, the NMR responses will vary. The portion of water may vary with binding mechanisms.Such binding changes are varient. For definition, permit the fraction of water present in phase number i be denoted by Pi typically a fraction or percent of water . For water in the phase i the relaxation time for that water is Ti. Assume that there is a slow exchange between phases, an assumption that the relaxation time of this phase Ti is less than the lifetime of water in phase i, the NMR signal voltage as a function of time is given by Equation 1 EMI3.1 Recalling that there are up to n phases of water present, each particular phase of water binding relaxes afterNMR interrogation independent of the others and each has a time constant Ti through Tn respectively. Equation 1 was based on a slow exchange.In the event of a rapid exchange wherein Ti is much greater than the lifetime in phase i, theNMR signal voltage as a function of time is given by Equation 2 EMI4.1 Summing Equation 2 for all water phases where i l up to i n, one obtains a single characteristic time given byEquation 3 EMI4.2 Simplifications can be made from the general statements given above by reducing n to two, the typical case involving NMR interrogation of the female breast in detection of water which is bound in normal tissue. This permits development of a relatively exact expression. This exact expression relates to tissue water which can be generally described as tightly bound and loosely bound water. In the presence of a cancerous tumor, the relaxation time for water in the cancerous tissue is longer than the relaxation time for the healthy tissue. Because the tissue is made of water in various binding phases, and because there is exchange between the two phases of water in both healthy tissue and cancerous tissue, the NMR signal is given either by Equation 1 for slow water exchange or by Equations 2 and 3 for a rapid water exchange. Assume that the female breast includes a cancer.Assume that a slow interchange of water does occur between the healthy tissue and the cancerous tissue. The water will then be in three phases one tightly bound, one loosely bound in the healthy tissue, and a third loosely bound in the cancer site. Under this assumption, i 3 for Equation 1 and hence,Equation 1 can be written as Equation 4 EMI5.1 In Equation 4 the fractions P are the fractions of water in each binding phase converted into voltages.Likewise, each water phase has its own characterisic spin spin relaxation time T2 thereafter and this is also shown inEquation 4 . Equation 4 is an equation for the spin spin relaxation time signal which is v2 t while Equation 5 can be written for the spin Jattice relaxation time vl t . This equation follows the same general form as Equation 4 .EMI5.2 Assuming water in healthy tissue is in two binding phases, the hydrogen transient NMR signal is given by Equation 6 EMI5.3 In similar fashion, the hydrogen transient NMR system involving a three component system where one component is cancerous tissue and the other two components are healthy tissue is given by Equation 7 EMI5.4 Assume as successive NMR signals are obtained from adjacent layers through the female breast a progression from the first to the Nth layer , the signal of Equation 6 represents a signal from a layer of healthy tissue while the signal of Equation 7 represents a layer having cancerous tissue.Subtracting Equation 6 from Equation 7 yields a difference signal given by Equation R 8 Vdiff. Vc2 Vh2 Grouping similar relaxation times, Equation R can then be written as Equation 9 where the difference signal is given by EMI6.1 The first and second terms of Equation 9 have similar coefficients and hence their difference becomes relatively small. That is, they are relatively small, observing the subtractive factors. By contrast, the third term is by its nature a smal coefficient. A limit condition can be obtained as the cancerous tissue approaches zero or all tissue becomes healthy. In that event, the approach toward zero impacts each of the subtractive coefficients of the first and second terms where the limit is given by P2le P21h.This reduces the first term toward zero. In like fashion, the limit observed at P22C P22h substantially reduces the second term. In these limit conditions, both the first and second terms drop out, yielding Equation 10 which is markedly simpler in contrast with Equation 9 EMI6.2 To obtain Equation 10 , it will be observed that certain limits are approached. These limits reduce the signal resulting from similarities while accenting or increasing the relative difference see Equation 10 . In the limit situation, the difference signal contains only the cancerous component. The difference signal, showing decreased similarities and increased differences, provides an accent between adjacent layers from sequential NMR hydrogen transient signals.A graph of the difference signals between adjacent layers as a function of layers as the number of layers approaches N yields an indication of the first and last layers in which the cancerous tumor is located. That is, assume that the tumor is located between layers 100 and 105.If 150 data points are taken N 150 , then the difference signal will not yield an image indicative of a cancerous tumor until N is in the range of 100 105. This helps isolate the layer s in which the tumor is located. The difference signal can thus be isolated and the relative location of the tumor is then known. Utilizing typical scale factors, the NMR signal level is in the range of 5 volts. In that range, assume that the noise level is around 1 millivolt. Assume further that signals from adjacent layers represent volumes which dq not differ by more than about 5 . Geometrically speaking, with 150 samples N 150 the shape of the female breast may be approximated from layer to layer as a triangle where the layers will differ by 5 or less in volume between adjacent layers. That is, adjacent layers will not differ in size by more than by 58. Assuming a digitized signal format that is, the variable signal is in digital form and further assuming subtraction accuracy of one part in 1024 parts, the accuracy of the data can then be determined.If a first layer has a S volt signal, then the adjacent layer will have a signal of 5.25 volts maximum recalling the assumption of not more than 58 volumetric variation , then the subtraction of these two signals will provide a resultant output differential of up to 0.25 volts digitizing accuracy should be added and this typically represents about 0.01 differential. Thus, a normal signal representing up to 5 size change without cancerous tissue at the most will be about 0.25 volts 0.15 volts. The foregoing is assumed for healthy tissue. Assume that a cancer is present and represents about 1 . of the volume. In this event, 1 of the 5 volt signal is about 0.05 volts. A signal level of about 0.05 volts indicative of cancer when confronted with a variation of 0.25 plus or minus 0.01 volt as a result of digitizing and geometric change on subtraction yields a cancerous tissue signal which is about 5 30 or 162 of the output differential signal. The signal to noise ratio of the subtracted signal is around 30 to 1. Going now to Equations 6 and 7 and making assumptions based on the above geometry a digitizing error of 0.01 volt, a geometric factor of 5 , and a desire to locate cancers of 1 of the volume of the layer , this then provides values for the constants in Equation 6 and 7 .The constants are P21h 5 3 P22h 10 3 P2le 5.25 3 P22C 10.5 3 P23e 0.05 Substituting these values into Equations 6 and 7 , the values obtained from Equation 9 for the first and second coefficients are EMI8.1 Subst.ituting these values from Equations 11 and 12 intoEquation 9 , the difference equation then becomes EMI8.2 Setting the exponentials to a time equal to zero obtains Equation 14 14 vdiff. t O 0.25 0.01 0.05 0.30 0.01 From the foregoing, it will be observed that the assumption of a cancer filling 1 of the volume of the slice of the female breast in comparison with the adjacent slice provides an adequate size signal with a suitable signal to noise ratio to enable Aetection of the cancer output signal. That is, this cancer signal is sufficiently large to enable detection of a signal of this small amplitude. It is generally believed that detection of cancerous tumors in the size of 1 volume of a particular slice is sufficiently sensitive and represents such early detection that curative procedures can be more readily adapted. The manner of presentation of this data should be considered. Assume that N 150. Assume also that the time required to obtain each data point is one second, a relatively slow repetition rate. 150 data points can be obtained. This yields 149 difference signals. The signals are obtained by subtracting consecutive or adjacent data entries as N approaches 150. The presentation of data is perhaps best implemented on a white to gray scale on an oscilloscope presentation. The difference signal from adjacent pixels enhances the differences as described above so that the enhanced image will more readily show cancerous tissue. Therefore, the location of the cancer can then be readily determined. Consider as an extreme example a cancer which represents 10 of a given slice or layer. In that event, signal amplitude is markedly increased and a signal to noise ratio is improved even further. For the sake of good health, 18 volume seems a minimum value for cancer detection. The signal from healthy breast tissue may have two parts, one from the hydrogen in the tissue and one from the hydrogen in the water. When cancerous tissue is present along with healthy tissue there are two values of T2 for water, one for the water in the healthy tissue T2h and a second for the water in the cancerous tissue T2c It has been found experimentally, on the average, that T2e equal 2T2h.The echo signal from a thin layer of a breast with cancerous tissue will have a voltage amplitude given by Equation 15 EMI9.1 where All is a voltage proportional to the number of hydrogen nuclei in the volume of the water in the healthy tissue, andA21 is the voltage proportional to the number of hydrogen nuclei in the volume of the water in the cancerous tissue.By definition, the tota volume of the layer of breast isA01 All A21. When Equation 15 is normalized to unity at t equals zero, one obtains Equation 16 EMI9.2 Tarqettinq a mimimum size of 1.0 for A21 of the total volume, then Equation 17 is EMI10.1 When the NMR measurements are made on N layers through the breast, there will be somewhere a layer n without cancer adjacent to the layer n l with cancer. The equation for the n layer without cancer, follows Equation 16 , will be Equation 18 EMI10.2 where A12 is a voltage proportional to the number of hydrogen nuclei in the water in the volume of the n layer without cancer adjacent to n l layer. This difference technique involves the subtraction of Equation 18 from Equation 16 . First assume that the volumes of the water in the two adjacent layers of breast are equal and the tissue density is the same, that is A01 Ao2. When Equation 1J is subtracted from Equation 17 the result is Equation 19 EMI10.3 with equal volumes in adjacent layers n and n l , the healthy component equals the cancer component. If it is assumed that the volume of the n l layer slice with the cancer is up to 58 greater than the layer without the cancer, then from Equation 18 one obtains Equation 20 EMI10.4 When Equation 20 is subtracted from Equation 17 , or when the signals from adjacent layers are subtracted, the result isEquation 21 EMI10.5 In Equation 21 , the ratio of the two signal components is now 1 5 whereas before subtraction they were 1 99 in Equation 17 . The values of T2h and T2C given in the literature are 0.05 and 0.10 seconds respectively.When these values are used, Equation 17 gives a straight line to graph beyond 0.7 second where the cancerous tissue signal component becomes readily apparent. The difference signal of Equation 21 gives a graph with the cancer component evident beyond 0.3 second because the cancer signal component is then larger. NMR interrogation is not limited to a single pulse the interrogation pulse sequence can be a dual pulse sequence with specific spacing between the two pu ses. The voltage amplitude of the echo following a 90 180e dual pulse sequence is directly proportional to Mo, the nuclear magnetization, and to an exponential with a time constant isT2. Equation 22 is EMI11.1 where is the spacing between the 90 and 180 pulses and kl is the detection constant. The nuclear magnetization Mo is Xn Ho where Xn is the nuclear volume susceptibility and Ho is the applied magnetic field.Substituting the nuclear volume susceptibility definition, the nuclear magnetization isEquation 23 EMI11.2 where NO is the total number of nuclei per unit volume, is the nuclear magnetic movement, k is the Boltzmann constant andT is the absolute temperature. When Equation 23 is substituted into Equation 22 , the echo voltage amplitude isEquation 24 EMI11.3 thus it is seen that the echo voltage is directly proportional to the number of detected nuclei per unit volume. The echo voltage output signal is verification that tumor mass is proportional to signal amplitude and hence signal size. This is significant in establishing minimum tumor size for NMR detection. Consider the minimum size tumor which can be detected using this technique. Assume tht the N layers of the breast tested by this procedure are right cylinders and hence have a volume of r2d where r is radius and thickness is represented by d. A small cancer with a cross sectional area of 0.78 cm2 has a volume of the cancer in the layer of n.7Sd cm3. The layer volume then is 78d while the cancer volume is 0.78d, making the cancer to be one percent of the layer volume if r is assumed to be 5 cm. In this instance, a cancer of this size is significantly small that early detection markedly increases the probabilities of full health protection. At Equation 6 and following, water in both healthy and cancerous tissue was assumed. The hydrogen NMR response from both types of tissue is the talisman yielding NMR response for detection. Water in tissue is in differing binding phases. There is exchange between these phases, and, in general, if Pi denotes the fraction of water present in phase number i, if the relaxation time for this phase is Ti, if there is a slow exchange Ti the lifetime in phase number i , then the NMR signal voltaqe as a function of time isEquation 25 EMI12.1 Each phase relaxes essentially independently with its own time constant Ti.For the case of rapid exchange Ti lifetime in phase number i , the NMR sign voltage as a function of time is Equation 26 EMI12.2 For rapid exchanqe, the whole system relaxes with a single characteristic time T qiven by Equation 27 EMI13.1 In the special case of two phases, an exact expression can be developed for the condition between the slow and the fast exchange limiting cases. Most of the measurements of NMR relaxation data from tissue water have shown two phases that are sometimes known as bound and free . When cancer is present, the relaxation time for the water in the cancerous tissue is twice the relaxation time in the healthy tissue. When there is a slow exchange betweeen the water in the healthy and cancerous tissue1 then the NMR signal will be acccording to Equation 25 . When there is a rapid exchange, the NMR signal will follow Equations 26 and 27 . It has been shown that there are two relaxation times slow interaction for the water in cancer containing tissue. There is one relaxation from the hydrogen in the water in the healthy tissue and another from the hydrogen in the water in the cancerous tissue. For this case, Equation 25 can be written for i 2 to be the form of Equation 6 above. From that equation, the fractions P21 and P22 are the fractions in each binding phase of the water in healthy tissue, and T21 and T22 are the values of the spin spin relaxation time for each water phase. The hydrogen transient NMR signal from healthy tissue with one water component is Equation 28 EMI13.2 and that from cancerous tissue with two water binding components simplified from Equation 7 is given by Equation 29 EMI13.3 In this difference technique, the NMR signal of Equation 28 is from the layer of tissue adjacent to the cancerous layer giving the NMR signal of Equation 29 , and the equations are subtracted to obtain a difference signal or vc2 vh2.Considering that T21 has the same value in Equations 28 and 29 , the difference signa is Equation 30 EMI14.1 This difference signal similar to the three phase relationship in Equation 9 gives a decrased amplitude for theT21 term, but the component from the cancerous tissue is not decreased. In the limit case of P2lv P2lh the difference signal is similar to Equation 10 and is Equation 31 EMI14.2 Considerinq Equations 30 and 31 , the difference signal decreases the similarities between the hydrogen transient NMR siqnals from healthy and cancerous tissue while increasing the relative difference between them. In the limit where the similarities are the same, the difference signal will contain only the cancerous component. The use of the difference signal, because it decreases similarities and increases differences, turns the hydrogen transient NMR signals from layers of tissue into displays or the differences between adjacent layers. The graph of the difference signals between adjacent layers, as a function of location from 0 to N layers gives an indication of the beginning and ending of a cancerous inclusion in one or more layers. The difference signal will not give an image of the cancerous inclusion hut will indicate in which layer or layers it resides for an enchanced screening indication. This difference indication is much less complicated and less expensive for tumor screening.
