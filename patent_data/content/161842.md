# Half tone dot imaging.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for generating a half tone dot representation of an original image which has been previously generated as one or more colour separations each comprising a plurality of cells 12 , each cell being digitally encoded in ac cordance with the colour density at that ooint is described. The apparatus comprises a record medium support 8 a plurality of scanning beam generators arranged side by side, the scann ing beams B1 6 and tie record medium support 8 being relatively movable. First control means controls the scanning beams during relative movement between the scanning beams and the record medium support 8 in response to the digital in formation and half tone dot information to generate a plurality of half tone dots 14 at a first rate, each dot corresponding to one or more of the plurality of cells 12 . Storage means 23 for storing additional control information and second control 24 means for determining the position of the scanning beams relatively to the record medium, determining whether that posi tion corresponds to part of a boundary of an image portion. and, if it does, for at least one colour separation, for each cell at the boundary of an image portion modifying the plurality of scanning beams in response to the additional control informa tion i a together at a second higher rate, or i b in groups of one or more, or i c in groups of one or more and at a second, higher rate, and ii in response to colour density information partly cor responding to that cell and partly corresponding to one or more adjacent cells. The invention thus puts a relatively high resolution edge on a relatively low resolution image.
