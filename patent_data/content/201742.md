## Description
The present invention relates to a novel compound that exhibits enzyme inhibiting activity against prolyl endopeptidase EC, 3.4.21.26 . The invention also relates to a method for chemical synthesis of such novel compound, as well as its use as a prolyl endopeptidase activity inhibitor and a drug, in particular an anti amnesic agent, that contains it as the active ingredient. Prolyl endopeptidase is known to inactivate neuro transmitters such as Substance P, thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH and neurotensin, or vasopressin speculatively associated with memory. Tsuru and Yoshimoto of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, found that compounds capable of inhibiting the prolyl endopeptidase activity were effective for preventing experimental amnesia caused in rats by scopolamine. Based on this discovery, they suggested the potential use of prolyl endopeptidase activity inhibitors as anti amnesic agents T. Yoshimoto and D. Tsuru, Agr. Biol. Chem. EP A 0172458 discloses an anti amnesic agent containing as an active ingredient an N acylpyrrolidine derivative of formula in which n represents a number of 1 to 4 and R is a lower alkyl ester group, CH₂OH or an aldehyde group. Motivated by the report of Tsuru and Yoshimoto, the present inventors made various efforts to find novel compounds that exhibited strong anti amnesic activity and which yet had satisfactorily low toxicity levels. As a result the inventors have found that N acylpyrrolidine derivatives with anti prolyl endopeptidase activity having the formula I shown below exhibited excellent effects against amnesia. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. The N acylpyrrolidine derivatives of the present invention are represented by the general formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or phenyl group, Each of R¹ and R² as a lower alkyl group may, for example, be straight or branched alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl and i propyl etc. When R² is a substituted phenyloxy group or substituted phenyl group, the substituent may, for example, be a halogen atom or a lower alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. When R² is said aralkyl group or R² forms a benzylidene group together with R¹, their aromatic rings may be substituted by a halogen atom or a lower alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The compounds of formula I differ greatly from the known 2 oxopyrrolidine anti amnesic agents such as piracetam or aniracetam in that the former contains a proline residue or a derivative thereof in its structure. Because of this feature, the compounds of formula I present extremely low toxicity levels in organisms. The compounds of formula I of the present invention may be synthesized by the following procedures The compound of the invention formed in the reaction mixture may be isolated by an appropriate conventional purification method such as column chromatography, preparative thin layer chromatography or distillation. The compound of the present invention exerts an inhibitory effect against prolyl endopeptidase. For example, the inhibitory effect of the compounds against this enzyme was examined using z glycyl prolyl β naphthylamide as a substrate. As shown later in the experimental example, the compound I showed inhibitory activity against prolyl endopeptidase but none at all against papain, bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin and thermolysin. The above inhibitory effect enables the application of the present invention for the purpose of improving brain malfunction including application to amnesia. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to Examples. A mixture of N 3 phenoxy propionyl prolinol 1.4 g and triethylamine 1.7 g was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide 16 ml , and to the stirred solution, a solution 16 ml of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex 2.6 g in dimethyl sulfoxide was added. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 10 minutes, the reaction solution was poured into iced water 150 ml and subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed successively with 10 aqueous citric acid, water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After distilling off the solvent under vacuum, the resulting crude product was purified by medium pressure liquid column chromatography on silica gel solvent chloroform to obtain the end compound as an oil 1.2 g . The analytical data for the compounds obtained in Example 1 is listed in Table 1. The other compounds listed in Table 1 were also obtained by processes similar to the above examples from the corresponding starting compounds. The method of Yoshimoto and Tsuru T. Yoshimoto and D. Tsuru, Agr. Biol. Chem. A sample for a blind test was prepared by using the buffer instead of the anti prolyl endopeptidase compound and its absorbance b was also measured. The percent inhibition of prolyl endopeptidase was calculated by the formula Several of the anti prolyl endopeptidase compounds of the present invention were checked for their ability to prevent the inhibition of long term memory fixation by scopolamine. Solutions of physiological saline that contained selected compounds of the present inventions in an amount of 1 mg kg were administered intraperitoneally to Wister male rats 100 120 g . One hour after the administration, electric shocks were applied to the rats so that they would acquire passive avoidance learning. Immediately thereafter, scopolamine was administered intraperitoneally to each rat in an amount of 3 mg per kg of body weight. The result of the test was assessed both 24 hours and 48 hours after the administration of scopolamine. The number of amnesic rats and of sound rats was counted for both the control group rats which were not given the test compounds but to which scopolamine and physiological saline alone were administered intraperitoneally and the treated group rats to which both the test compound and scopolamine were administered . The results are shown in Table 3. Among the tested compounds, SUAM 1051, SUAM 1055 and SUAM 1065 showed particularly remarkable effects. The present invention also relates to an anti amnesic agent useful for the treatment of diseases originating from organic disorders in the brain. The anti amnesic agent comprises at least one compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The formulation of the agent of the invention includes either solid formulations such as capsules, tablets and powders or a liquid formulations such as elixirs, syrups and suspensions for oral administration. Alternatively, the active compounds I may be formulated as injections or suppositories. The carrier included in the agent of the invention may be selected from pulverulent solid carriers such as lactose, saccharose, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose, and glycine etc. The agent of the invention may further contain a lubricant, a binder or a disintegrater. Examples of lubricant are silicon dioxide, talc, magnesium stearate and polyethylene glycol. Examples of binder are starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Examples of disintegrator are starch and agar etc. The active ingredient I of the agent of the invention is orally administered to an adult patient in a dose of 10 to 4000 mg, preferably 100 to 1000 mg day, or administered parenterally in a dose of 1 to 2000 mg, preferably 50 to 500 mg day. The dose may be varied depending on the disease, age, weight, or condition of the patient or the formulation of the drugs. The ingredients are mixed thoroughly, and tablets or capsules are formulated from the mixture. The above ingredients are mixed thoroughly, and powders or fine granules are formulated form the mixture. The above ingredients are mixed under heating, and dispensed under sterile conditions into ampoules to obtain injections.
