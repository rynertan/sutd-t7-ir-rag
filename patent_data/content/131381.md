# ELASTOMERICALLY SUPPORTED PIVOTED PAD BEARING

## Abstract
A pivoted pad bearing is supported on an elastomeric pad fully contained by a supporting structure. The elastomeric pad contains some liquid. The liquid filled pad is extremely strong in compression but can pivot. The pivoted pad assembly is somewhat flexible. This flexibility is useful under conditions of fluctuating load where squeeze film effects are superim posed upon wedge film effects.
