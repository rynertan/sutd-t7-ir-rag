# Hairpin type electric resistance heating element and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
An electric resistance heating element of the hairpin type is provided by a molybdenum disilicide resistance wire loop transversely connected to molybdenum disilicide terminals. The resistance wire is sandwiched between the ends of two pieces of terminal wire and the ends of these pieces are butt welded together on the resistance wire, to form each terminal.
