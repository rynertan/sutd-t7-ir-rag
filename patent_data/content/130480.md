# Process for the preparation of ceramic powders.

## Abstract
Sub micron sized powders of the ceramic metal oxides such as zirconia, alumina, titania, etc. are produced by precipi tation from substantially anhydrous solutions of salts of the corresponding metal s with substantially anhydrous solutions of alkali metal hydroxides. The precipitates are subsequently washed with water to remove any residual soluble salt and or solvent, then are dried and usually calcined. The powders thus produced are readily sintered to high density ceramic bodies after conventional pressing into the desired shape. The process is especially suited to the production of zir conia powders, either pure or doped with conventional stabiliz ing oxides such as yttria. In a typical example, a zirconia pow der doped with 5.4 by weight of yttria is prepared by adding a solution of zirconium tetrachloride and yttrium chloride in an hydrous ethanol to a solution of sodium hydroxide in anhy drous ethanol. After washing, drying at 105 C, and calcining at 500 C for two hours, the powder is pressed at 5000 psi into a green body with a density of 1.46 Mg m³. After one hour of sin tering at 1600 C, the fired body has a density of 5.84 Mg m³, which is 96 of the theoretical maximum.
