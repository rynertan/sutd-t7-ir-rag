# Improved insulator for use in automotive suspension or the like.

## Abstract
The present invention features an insulator unit for supp orting a suspension arrangement on a chassis or the like. The main elastomeric body of the insulator is arranged to have sufficient rigidity as to limit the displacement of the suspen sion with respect to the chassis. The device further includes a vibratory mass or masses which upon being excited cancel vibrations which would otherwise be transmitted through the main elastomeric member.
