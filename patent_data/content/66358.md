# Method of leaching a layer from an article.

## Abstract
A closed loop assembly for dissolving a layer from an article by exposing the article to a leaching solution having a predetermined boiling temperature. The assembly includes a sealed reaction container including an inner compartment to contain the leaching solution and the article, a recirculation system connected to the reaction container for receiving boiled off leaching solution vapor and condensing the vapor and returning the vapor to the reaction container, and a heater for heating the article within the reaction container above the boiling temperature of the leaching solution. The assembly performs a method of dissolving the layer from an article by exposing the article to the leaching solution. The steps include placing the article in the inner compartment of the sealed reaction container containing the leaching solution, heating the article to a temperature above the boiling temperature of the leaching solution to increase the corrosion rate of the outer layer of the article, conducting and condensing boiled off leaching solution vapor in the recirculation system, and selectively returning the collective leaching solution to the reaction container.
