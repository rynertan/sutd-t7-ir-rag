# Splitting device.

## Abstract
A log splitter comprising a head portion having a cutting edge with two pivoting members each pivoting member contains cutting and thrust levers located on a single pivot point. The cutting levers are located along the head portion cutting edge. The thrust levers are displaced from the head portion cutting edge on opposite sides. When thrust against a log, the cutting levers and the head portion cutting edge simultaneously penetrate the log, followed by contact of the thrust levers causing the cutting levers to rotate outwardly in opposite directions thereby enhancing splitting of the log.
