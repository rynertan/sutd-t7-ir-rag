# Borehole compensation method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Compensation of photoelectric absorption measurements for borehole effects during nuclear logging of downhole earth formations is accomplished in a method and apparatus of the invention by detecting low energy gamma radiations entering two detectors 22, 23 in the logging tool apparatus along paths having substantially constant formation components but varying borehole components.
