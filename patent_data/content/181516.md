# Data processing apparatus having efficient min and max functions.

## Abstract
It is arranged according to the invention that there are provided latches 8, 12 temporarily storing the data being supplied to the two input ports of an ALU 7 , the outputs of which latches and that of the ALU being switched by a multiplexer 9 for selected final output. And, it is also arranged that the smaller or larger one of two temporarily stored data items 8, 12 is obtained according to the status carry CY of the ALU and a novel instruction MIN or, respectively, MAX. Therefore, in determining the minimum or maximum value of a given set of data values having N elements, it is only required to execute the MIN or MAX instruction N 1 times, and the maximum or minimum can thus be determined easily and fast. That is, the length of a program is shortened and the execution time is reduced.
