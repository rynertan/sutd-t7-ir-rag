# Hot melt adhesive delivery system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for dispensing a hot melt thermoplastic consists of a hopper 16 containing granular thermoplastic, an extruder 10 for melting the molten thermoplastic and delivering it to a manifold 30 and thence to an applicator 38 for dispensing the molten thermoplastic. Optionally an accumulator can be attached to allow the molten thermo plastic to accumulate during off periods of the applicator. Operation of the applicator controls operation of the extruder and the accumulator.
