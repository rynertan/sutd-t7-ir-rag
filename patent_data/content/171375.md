# High pressure water valve.

## Abstract
A high pressure water valve 18 supplies water under very high pressure to nozzles 14 for cutting rock or concrete by water jets emitted from the nozzles. A valve plug 30 rotates in bearing rings 27 and cooperates with a valve bushing of wear resistant high strength material to control the water supply to the nozzles via one or more valve open ings 28 in said bushing or plug. High pressure water in a pressure opening 33 in respectively the plug or bushing forces the plug to sealingly occlude one or more valve open ings 28 disposed diametrically opposite to said pressure opening.
