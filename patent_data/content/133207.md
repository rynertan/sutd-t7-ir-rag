# Light by passing device.

## Abstract
A light by passing device is connected in cascade be tween transparent cylindrical optical conductors 1, 2 , and is used for the purpose of by passing and taking out a part of the light transmitted through them. Said light by passing device is comprised of first and second transparent cylindri cal members 11, 12 and three spacers 13, 14, 15 of the same thickness interposed between the first and second cylindrical members. The shape of the first and second cylindrical members edge surfaces are opposed to each other through the spacers that have first horizontal water level surfaces, inclined surfaces following the first horizon tal surfaces, and second horizontal water level surfaces following the inclined surfaces. The spacer interposed be tween the inclined surfaces has a round hole through which light passes. It also has a grasping part used to insert or take out.
