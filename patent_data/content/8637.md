# Electronic ultrasonic sector scanning apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An electronically scanned phased array diagnostic sys tem for describing internal structure of a subject by the use of ultrasonic energy. The system includes a transducer unit with an array of ultrasonic energy conversion segments and con trol circuitry for actuating the segments to direct ultrasonic energy into the subject. Imaging circuitry is included for inter preting electrical return signals produced by the segments in response to ultrasonic echoes. The imaging circuitry includes transmission delay circuits for imposing time delays on the return signals for steering and focusing system echo recep tion. Each transmission delay circuit includes first and second delay elements for impressing first and second delay time components on the return signals. Each pair of the first delay elements are coupled in parallel with separate transducer elements, and serially combined with a downstream second delay element. The first delay elements provide a portion of the reception steering capability. The second elements pro vide the remainder of the steering, and the beam focusing, delay components. The system further includes display apparatus responsive to the delayed return signals for pro ducing an image of the subject s internal structure.
