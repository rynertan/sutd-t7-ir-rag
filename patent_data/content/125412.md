# Radiation image recording and reproducing system.

## Abstract
A stimulable phosphor 3 is exposed to a radiation passing through an object P to have a radiation image stored therein, and then exposed to stimulating rays 11 to read out the radiation image and obtain an electric image signal. The image signal is processed under conditions suitable for the type of image recording and used to reproduce a visible image 6, 13 . The conditions of exposure to the radiation and the image processing conditions are adjusted by a single action of selecting the setting conditions predetermined according to the type of image recording 2 . Also, read out of an identification code 3A provided on the stimulable phosphor and the exposure to the radiation are started by a single action. Or, the read out of the identifica tion code is conducted in response to memorizing of information on the object.
