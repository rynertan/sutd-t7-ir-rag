# METHOD OF MAKING BISIMIDE COATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A method of making a bisimide coating composition comprises a mixing at least one lactam and or amino acid component A with at least one dianhydride component B in a mole ratio of A B of from 0.01 1 to 10 1 to form an N,N disubstituted bisimide dicarboxylic acid, b dissolving the product from step a in a water miscible solvent, c mixing water with the solution from step b to form a solution comprising from 10 to 80 by weight of water, d mixing at least one aromatic diamine component C with the solution from step c , and e mixing at least one tertiary amine component D , in an amount of from 2 to 20 by weight based on the water added in step c , with the solution from step d to give the coating composition.
