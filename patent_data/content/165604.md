# RECORDING REPRODUCING APPARATUS INCLUDING A DIGITAL MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A recording reproducing device 100 includes a digital memory device 12 . Acoustic information such as voices and music normally contains undesirable acoustic informa tion, e.g., noises. To save the digital memory capacity of the digital memory device 12 , such undesirable acoustic infor mation is deleted from the original acoustic information by a data analyzing device 6 before being recorded in the digital memory device 12 . In a memory region of the digital memory device 12 , there is data indicating the undesirable acoustic information. When the recorded acoustic informa tion of the digital memory device 12 is reproduced in a recording reproducing unit 14 , not only the recorded acoustic information but also the deleted undesirable acous tic information can be reproduced in a substantially original condition of the acoustic information.
