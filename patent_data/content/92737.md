# Lightning arrester.

## Abstract
A lightning arrester comprises a plurality of column blocks 1, 2, 3 disposed in parallel each of which has groups 4a, 4b, 4c 5a, 5b, 5c 6a, 6b, 6c of a number of stacked nonlinear resistance elements and spacers 7a, 7b 8a, 8b, 8c 9a, 9b, 9c interposed between the element groups 4a, 4b, ... 6b, 6c , in which the element groups 4a, 4b, ... 6b, 6c of the blocks 1, 2, 3 are electrically connected in series by jumper conductors 10, ... 17 so as to form a series resistance and the spacers 7a, 7b, ... 9b, 9c are formed of nonlinear resistance elements which can absorb energy, so that arrester, as a whole, can absorb larger energy.
