# INSULATION PIERCING COMPRESSION CONNECTOR

## Abstract
An insulation piercing electrical connector 20 includes a plurality of insulation piercing projections 38 which engage and secure the conductor 14 in compressive electrical contact. The insulation piercing projections 38 extend from resiliently deformable cantilevered contact arms 34 which are deflectable into contact with an insulated wire 14 . A plurality of intersecting slots 44 are formed by the insulation piercing projections 38 which compressively secure the conductor 14 therein.
