# Clamping structure for pressure fluid components.

## Abstract
A modular clamping system for coupling pressure fluid components 20 . Each component is formed with a head 22 or body 25 which may contain appropriate conduits and passages 29 . On each side of the body 25 there is provided transversely extending, downwardly tapered flanges 31 which are engaged by corresponding cam sur faces 45 on the interior surface of depending legs 42 on a clamping yoke 40 . A clamping or cam pin 50 having a longitudinal flat is inserted through corresponding apertures 51 in the depending legs and, upon rotation, tightly clamps the yoke to the component parts 20, 21 and thereby clamps the parts together in sealed relationship.
