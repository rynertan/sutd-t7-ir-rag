# Process for hydrotreating a liquid coal derived material.

## Abstract
A process for hydrotreating coal derived liquids in which no coking section is required, comprising passing the liquid over a catalyst which is molybdenum or tungsten disulphide on an active carbon support in the presence of hydrogen, at elevated temperature and pressure. The product liquor is substantially hydrocracked with reduced high boiling residue and increased distillates boiling below 300 C.
