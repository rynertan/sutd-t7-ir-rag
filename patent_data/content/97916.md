# Power supply for plural motors.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a power supply system, in which a single variable voltage supply device 38 is used as a power source for a plurality of motors 24, 37 45, 50 which are simultaneously or successively rotated, in which each motor is subjected to constant current driving by a current control device 18, 19, 20 69, 70, 71 connected to the motor, and in which the variable voltage supply device is controlled so as to produce a voltage which is the sum of the highest one of the voltages required for driving the motors and necessary and minimum voltage with which all the current control devices are operable.
