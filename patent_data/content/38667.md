# IgM derivatives and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
IgM derivatives into which acyl groups expressed by the following formula I are introduced to make their anticom plement activity weak by acylating the free amino groups existing in IgM up to 1 90 acylation percentage COR I where R indicates an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a carboxylated alkyl group expressed by CHâ‚‚ mCOOH m is 2 or 3 or CH CHCOOH. These IgM derivatives can be used for making immunog lobulin preparations for intravenous injection use.
