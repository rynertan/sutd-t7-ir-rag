## Description
The present invention relates to a scanning line interpolation circuit for a television signal, and more particularly to a signal processing circuit for a television signal in which an interlaced television signal is interpolated to thereby obtain a television signal having the double number of scanning lines according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1 and as known e.g. from GB A 2 114 848. There have been developed researches for obtaining high quality television receivers by further improving the reproduced picture quality of current television signals for example by NTSC system . As an effective one of such researches, there is a proposal of a signal processing circuit in which successive field signals of an interlaced television signal are superimposed, that is, a field memory is employed and input output signals of the field memory are changed over therebetween every scanning line, so as to obtain a television signal which is a sequential scanning signal and which has the doubled number of scanning lines for example, as disclosed GB A 2050109 . This signal processing circuit is effective to eliminate such a phenomenon that horizontal lines of characters flit in reproducing an interlaced signal, that is so called line flicker, to thereby improve in vertical resolution of pictures. In this signal processing circuit, however, there is a problem that if a picture moves the current field is displayed in a state where it overlaps on a picture one field before so that the displayed picture becomes a double picture to further deteriorate the picture quality, while there is a remarkable effect in improving in picture quality for a stationary picture. To solve this problem there are proposals for example described in GB A 2114848 in which interpolated scanning lines are obtained by averaging adjacent scanning signals, in which a movement detection circuit is provided in a signal processing circuit and a mixing circuit controlled by the output of the movement detection circuit combines a previous field signal etc. These proposals are disadvantageous however, in that the circuit arrangement becomes complicated, in that no sufficient effect can be obtained in improving in picture quality for both the stationary and moving pictures, etc. An object of the present invention is to provide a signal processing circuit in which an interlaced television signal is interpolated to thereby obtain a sequential television signal having the multiplied number of scanning lines, the television signal being improved in picture quality such that a double picture is prevented from being generated. This object is attained in three embodiments according to the invention by a scanning line interpolation circuit as defined in claims 1 to 3. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in Fig. 1 a block diagram of an embodiment of a scanning line interpolation circuit according to our invention. In Fig. 1, an interlaced television signal is applied through an input terminal 1 to a spatiotemporal filter 2 which is a main part of the embdiment according to the present invention. The output of filter 2 is converted in a time compression circuit 3 into a sequentially scanned television signal whose scanning line period is a half of that of the input television signal and whose scanning lines are two times in number as large as those of the input television signal, and the thus converted signal is transferred to a display not shown through an output terminal 4. The filter 2 may be constituted by filter constituent elements separately provided respectively for the input and output portions of the time compression circuit 3 when the filter 2 is provided at the output side of the time compression circuit 3. Although the arrangement and operation of the above mentioned various parts will be described hereunder as to an NTSC system television signal for the sake of explanation and merely by way of example, the television signal to be applied to the input terminal 1 according to the present invention is not limited to such an NTSC system television signal. The television signal applied to the input terminal 1 can be represented by three dimensions horizontal axis In Fig. 2, reference numeral 5 designates a picture represented by one field signal, and 6 a scanning line, and i, i 1, i 2, ... indicate the order offield. Each scanning line 6 is illustrated by a white dot 6 as shown in Fig. 3, when it is viewed in a two dimensional plane constituted by the time axis Since an interlaced television signal is obtained, in view of spatio temporal space, by sampling a television signal with the time frequency f The spatio temporal filter designated by the reference numeral 2 in Fig. 1 according to the present invention serves, as to the frequency domains in Fig. 4, to allow the components of the domain A to pass while to prevent, with respect to the domain B, at least the components having frequencies lower than the time frequency f Upon reception of a picture of doubled scanning lines including the scanning lines 6 and the interpolation scanning lines 7, a mean value of adjacent scanning lines separated from each other in the time direction by a field period 1 60 sec. is first calculated through a delay circuit 9 delay time 1 60 sec. , an adder 10, and a coefficient circuit 11. As known well, the transfer characteristic of these circuit can be expresed by the following equation 1 on the basis of the principle of delay filter The frequency response of the circuit from the input terminal 1 to an output terminal 15 is the product between the equations 1 and 2 and therefore expressed by the following equation 3 Thus, the output becomes zero at both the cases f Fig. 6 shows the relation between the output of the filter illustrated in Fig. 5 and having the characteristic expressed by the equation 3 and the scanning lines of a television signal. Fig. 6A illustrates four scanning lines a 1, a 2, a 3 and a 4 which are spatio temporally adjacent to each other under the condition that the field period that is frame period is 1 60 sec. and the scanning line interval is 1 525 picture height cycle . That is, the horizontal and vertical directions of Fig. 6A have the same physical meanings as those in Fig. 3. That is to say, the filter of Fig. 5 produces mean values of the respective signals of the scanning lines a 1, a 2, a 3, and a 4 as shown in Fig. 6A. In more particularly, a 1 is the signal directly produced at the output terminal 15 without passing through the delay circuits 9 and 12, a 2 the signal passed only the delay circuit 12, a 3 the signal passed only the delay circuit 9, and a 4 the signal passed both the delay circuits 9 and 12. The mean values of these signals a 1, a 2, a 3, and a 4 are produced at the output terminal 15. In the case where the input signal is such an interlaced television signal as shown in Fig. 3, however, no input signal exists at the position of the interpolation scanning line 7 and therefore the scanning lines are simplified as illustrated in Figs. 6B and 6C. That is, there are two cases, one being the case as shown in Fig. 6B where a means value is produced between the scanning line of in the current field of the current input television signal and a scanning line in the preceding field that is one field before of the current input television signal located directly above the first mentioned scanning line of the current field, and the other being the case as shown in Fig. 6C where a mean value is produced between the scanning line in the current field of the current input television signal and a scanning line in the preceding field that is one field before of the current input television signal located directly below the position of the position of the first mentioned scanning line of the current field. Each of the cases of Figs. 6A and 6C effects the filtering operation of Fig. 5 and it is apparent that the characteristic of the above mentioned spatio temporal filter can be realized. Figs. 7A, 7B, and 7C illustrate various embodiments of the interpolation circuit according to the present invention arranged on the basis of the principle as described above. In Fig. 7A, an input interlaced television signal is applied through an input terminal 1 to adders 17 and 19, and a field memory 23 which delays a received signal by 262H H represents one horizontal period . Signals delayed by 262H and 263H are obtained through the field memory 23 and a line memory 16 which delays by 1H, respectively. The thus delayed signals are respectively added to the current input television signal in adders 17 and 19, and the respective sums are multiplied by 1 2 in coefficient circuits 18 and 20 to thereby obtain two kinds of signals a and b for interpolation scanning lines corresponding to the respective cases of Figs. 6B and 6C. The time axis of these signals a and b is compressed to half in a time compression circuit, and the respective outputs of the time compression are alternately changed over by means of a change over circuit 22 to produce two scanning lines every H period, that is one scanning line signal every 1 2 H period. In other words, the two scanning line signals are alternately produced at a horizontal scanning period of the interpolated television signal so that a television signal which causes no quality deterioration due to interlace operation that is the components in the domain B in Fig. 4 are eliminated but which can display a high quality picture can be obtained from the output terminal 4. Although a particular arrangement of the time compression circuit 21 is not illustrated, a known circuit may be employed therefor. That is, the circuit may be arranged such that the output of the coefficient circuit 18 or 20 is written into a line memory constituted by a shift register, etc. at a predetermined writing speed and read out at a speed two times as high as the writing speed. In Fig. 7A, although the delay periods in the delay circuits 23 and 16 are about 1 60 sec. and one horizontal period of the interlaced television signal, respectively, the signal is converted to have a doubled speed so that the frequency characteristic across the input terminal 1 and the output terminal 4 becomes the same as that shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 7B shows the arrangement of another embodiment in which the input signal is delayed by 1H and 263H to thereby obtain similar interpolation signals. That is, an adder 17 adds a signal of a scanning line of a current input interlaced television signal and a signal of a scanning line one field before and located directly above the position of the first mentioned scanning line of the current input television signal. An adder 19 adds a 1H delayed signal of a scanning line of the current input television signal the output of the delay circuit 16 and a signal of a scanning line one line before and located directly above the position of the first mentioned scanning line of the current input television signal. Fig. 7C illustrates the arrangement of a further embodiment in which the constituent components of the spatio temporal filter are divided into two sections disposed at the input and output sides of the time compression circuit respectively. The same parts as those in Figs. 7A and 7B are designated by the same reference numerals as those used in Figs. 7A and 7B. In this embodiment, the circuit from an input terminal 1 to the output of a change over circuit 22 is the same as the conventionally known circuit in which a sequential scanning television signal having the doubled number of scanning lines is obtained by using a scanning line one field before of an interlaced television signal as an interpolation signal. In this embodiment, the above mentioned known interpolated television signal is added in an adder 25 to a signal obtained by delaying the interpolated television signal in a delay circuit 24 by 1H where H represents one horizontal scanning period of the interpolated television signal and is equal to 1 2H and multiplied by a coefficient 1 2 in a coeffcient circuit 26. In each of the embodiments of Figs. 7A, 7B, and 7C, averaged signals between the current input television signal and each of signals obtained by delaying the current input television signal by 262H and 263H are alternately produced through the output terminal 4 at a period of 1 2H. Fig. 8A shows the arrangement of another embodiment of the interpolation circuit according to the present invention. In each of the embodiments of Figs. 7A, 7B, and 7C, although a high quality picture can be obtained by preventing deterioration in picture quality due to interlace scanning from occurring, the picture may become somewhat defocused in the case of a moving picture because average values between pictures in adjacent fields are produced. The embodiment of Fig. 8A has an effect to prevent a moving picture from becoming blur. In Fig. 8A, the reference numerals 1, 3, 4, 16 20, 21 23 designate the same parts or circuit components as those in Fig. 7B. As interpolation signals in a moving picture portion, interpolation signals c and d which are located in the vertical positions with respect to the signals a and b , as shown in Fig. 8B, are obtained from a signal of a scanning line of the current input television signal and a signal obtained by delaying the first mentioned scanning line signal by 1H through linear interpolation through coefficient circuits 27, 28, 29 and 30, adders 31 and 32. The respective outputs of the coefficient circuits 18 and 20 and the respective outputs of the coefficient circuits 30 and 29 are multipled by coefficients k 0 k 1 and 1 k which change depending on the output k of a movement detection circuit 40 for detecting the degree of picture movement and added in adders 38 and 37 respectively, so that in the case of a stationary picture portion, the value of k is caused to approach 1 one to obtain interpolation signals by mean values between upper and lower scanning lines in adjacent fields, while in a moving picture portion, the interpolation signals are changed over to those obtained by scanning lines of the current field by causing the value of k to approach 0 zero , so that an interpolated television signal, which does not cause any blur in a moving picture is obtained at the output terminal 4. Although the description has been made above with respect to a black and white television signal, it is apparent that a high quality color picture can be displayed also in the case of a color television signal by performing the same processing as described above as to component signals such as a luminance signal and two color difference signals, or tri color signals, etc. In the case of NTSC system, it is apparent that the interpolation signal b for a luminance signal can be directly obtained even by processing a composite signal because a polarity of a modulated color signal of a scanning line deviated by 263 H from a current scanning line is opposite to that of the current scanning line, and accordingly, the present invention can be applied to a composite signal. Further, although the description has been made as to the system in which the number of scanning lines is 525 in view of the current television techniques in Japan and United States, it is apparent that the present invention can be applied to the case of the European system in which the number of scanning lines is 625 by merely changing the capacity of the field memory to 312H. Although calculation to produce a mean value between adjacent fields has been described in the above embodiments, the present invention is not limited to this, but it is possible to use a high order interpolation filter in which the output becomes zero at f
