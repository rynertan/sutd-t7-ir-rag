# Plasma spray coating composition, method of coating articles and articles coated with the composition.

## Abstract
A coating composition which may be plasma sprayed onto the surface of an article to protect the article from heat, wear, corrosion or radiation comprises a mixture of finely divided silicon carbide and finely divided silicon. This coating composition is applied to a substrate by plasma spraying. The resulting coating, consisting essentially of beta silicon carbide and silicon, is tightly adherent to the substrate. The substrate may be any material, either metallic or non metallic, to which the coating adheres. Examples of possible substrates are machining tools, valve seats and rocket nozzles.
