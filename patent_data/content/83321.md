## Description
METHOD AND EQUIPMENT OF IMPREGNATING A FOAMED RESIN WITH THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS This invention relates to a method and equipment for carrying out the impregnation of ari elastically con pressible foamed resin with thermoplasfic materials, such as bituminous materials, to form sealing elements having different sealing characteristics, according to the com pression degree thereof, as installed. The so obtained material is usable in many technical fields, by being preferably comprised of foamed polyurethane derived from polyester resins having a density ranging from 25 to 35 gull. and evenly impregnated with a thermoplastic materi ll, such as bitumen or a butyl resin having a penetration value in the order of 80 100, in an amount ranging from 100 to 150 g l. in such a manner that the impregna material will have a specific gravity ranging from 125 to 185 g l. This material is capable of operating at a temperatures from 10 C to 1100C and exhibits high water repellence characteristics. In order to obtain this material known per , two methods are substantially followed now, the former of which comprises the steps of impregnating the foamed resin with bitumen or a thermoplastic material by formijig ii emulsion of bitumen or thermoplastic material with water, dipping and sqeezing the foamed resin into the emulsion and then heat treating it in order to break the emulsiozi and release the water. This method presents some drawbacks since a product is obtained, whose water repellellce ckiaracte ristic are not always as high as possible, because it retains a certain water affinity.Furthermore this method is particu larly complex because of the necessary emulsion preparatioii step and the subsequents heat treatment for removing tjie water therefrom. The latter known method comprises the steps of impregnating the thermoplastic material into tiie resin by injection under pressure of the former into the latter t iroug1i a suitable apparatus. This method, in addition to the necessity of re jiIi ring expensive apparatus, is quite difficult to carry oiit since the thermoplastic material is injected at a temperature generally over 1700 C which is higher than the degradation temperature of the foamed resin about lA0 C . Therefore, it is necessary that the thermoplastic material temperature should very quickly decrease, before the resin characteristics can be affected, but after it is evenly distributed in the foamed resin. As a result, this second method is applicable only to resins comprised of foamed polyurethanes of a non conventional type, the cellular structure of which has been made fully open by evolvement of a gas or by a bad of diluted sodium hydroxide. These foams are very expensive arid therefore together with the necessary apparatus make the cost of the obtained product higher. Therefore, it is an object of the preselst inventions to provide a method and equipment of impregnation under the above mentioned conditions and for obtaining a material of the above defined type, which will permit this operation to be carried out with the highest homogeneity, without resorting to the water emulsion step and therefore a product to be obtained which will retain the best waterrepellence characteristics, while employing resins of conventional type and, obviously, without damages thereto. The invention relates to a method and equipment for impregnating an elastically compressible foamed resin with thermoplastic materials, such as bituminous materials having a substantially higher melting point than the degradation temperature of the resins, the foamed resin being in the form of a sheet of controlled thickness, the method comprising the steps of applying a layer of a thermoplastic material on a surface of the foamed resin sheet, pressing the resin sheet and the thermoplastic material layer together and allowing the resin to elastically expand. By means of the method according to the invention the advantage is obtained, that the thermoplastic material is merel y applied in the form of a layer on the surface of the foamed resin, particularly a polyurethane foam, and is not injected within the foam. This means that the thermoplastic material layer will have a higher viscosity and hence a lower temperature than in the case of the direct injection thereof.Therefore, since the thermal gradient between the thermoplastic material temperature and the maximal permissible temperature of the resin is smaller, the mutual contact can be extended with respect to the times necessary in the conventional injection method, or better, on the same temperature holding time of the thermoplastic material iri the contact condition with the resin, there is a lesser danger that the latter will degradate. Furthermore, the compression of tlie resin and thermoplastic material layer assembly can be carried out soon after the layer application has been performed and immediately thereafter the elastic expansion of the resin can be allowed, so that the thermoplastic material entered in the resin during the compression step will remain, homogeneously distributed therein. At the same time a quick cooling is performed, thereby avoiding internal migratiolls. This leads to an extremely homogeneous product even if the used foamed resin is of a conventional type, with a cellular by structure having mainly open pores, obtained reaction of nolvols with polyisocyanates.. This invention will be described now in greater details in connection to an enbodiment thereof, shown by way of example in the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows the steps or Ine iw ji w gnating method according to the present invention, in a simplest embodiment thereof Fig. 2 diagrammatically shows the impregnating method in an embodiment with two subsequent steps Fig.3 is a diagram of an equipment suitable for carrying out the method of Fig.2 Fig.4 is a diagrammatic illustration of the impregnating method according to another embodiment thereof Fig. 5 is a diagram of an equipment sul suitable for carrying out the method of Fig. 4. Referring first to Fig. 1, the foamed resin 10 to be impregnated is preferably comprised of a conventional polyurethane foam having a cellular structure mainly with opeii and intercommunicating cells, and a specific gravity raiiging from 10 to 100 g l.. This foamed resin is in the form of a sheet having a thickness S which may be different according to the circumstances, but always controlled. Applied above the sheet 10 in accordance with the invention, is a layer 12 of thermoplastic mate such as bitumen which can have a penetration value ranging from 40 60 to 180 200. The layer 12 must exhibit a certain viscosity, generally from 400 to 700 Cps and will have a thickness s which is depending on the impregnation degree required for the final product, obviously taking iiito account the thickness of the sheet 10 and the weight of the used thermoplastic material.Immediately after the applicatioii of the layer 12 of thermoplastic material or bitumen, all the assembly is subjected to a pressing action, e. g. by calende ring, as will be seen better hereinafter, until a tliickiiess II is reached, which is correlated with the thicknesses S and s and such as to assure the desired penetration of the bitumen layer 12 into the open cells 14 of tJue resin sleet 10.This impregnation has been diagrammatically shown in the drawings by plus signs drawn within the cells 14 of the resin 10. Once the above mentioned compression has been performed the resin sheet 10, now impregnated with bitumen, is immedia tely allowed to expand again to its original thickness S, iii order to obtain the desired final product, indicated at 16 in Fig.l, in which the thermoplastic material is homogeneously distributed in the cellular structure of the resin. It should be noted that the resin sheet expansion causes a simultaneous and quick cooling effect on the bitumen within the cells 14, so that the cont act time between resin and bitumen will be minimized, when the latter is at such a temperature as to be able of damaging the resin.It has been proved that all the operation can be carried out in a so very short time, that the holding time of the molten bitumen on the resin, starting from the application of the layer 12 to the cooling down to a lower temperature than that dangerous for the resin, can be lesser that 3 seconds. This will permit the impregnation to be carried out with the best accuracy without the need of employing special resins. Since the compression operation of the resin sheet 10 and the thermoplastic material layer 12 is preferably performed by calendering, it can be suitable to carry out the impregnating operation in two steps and simultaneously on two resin sheets 10,101 in order to avoid the calender rollers to be dirty with bitumen, as indicated in Fig.2.In this case a first calendering operation is performed, in which the bitumen layer 12 is distributed within the cellular structure of the resin sheets 10,10 to a lower depth than the thickness S of the sheets, generally in the order of one half or more this thickness. Thus a partially impregnated intermediate product 18,18 , is obtained, which is comprised of two resin sheets which are then rotated by 1800 and subjected again to an application of a bitumen layer 22, a calendering and a reexpansion operation, starting from the surfaces 20,20 which were not inv6l ved in the application of the layer 12.During this second application of the bitumen layer 22, there is no risk of making the calender rollers dirty, because the bitumen applied on the surfaces 24,24 of the partially impregnated sheets 18,18 is already cooled and therefore will be not transferred to said rollers. In an embodiment of the invention according to the method of Fig.2, two resin sheets 10,101, each having a thickness of 10 mm, are provided with a bitumen layer 12 having a thickness of 1 1,2 mm.. Under these conditions the first calendering operation was carried out with a roller nip X fig.2 of 2 mm so as to obtain sheets 18,18 impregnated to about a thickness of 5 mm. The second calen dering operation was carried out with a roller nip Y fig.2 of the order of 12 mm, thereby completing the sheet impregnation. It should be understood that the method can be carried out at higher speeds that those of the conventional method of injecting the thermoplastic material, e.g. speeds in the order of 5 m min. as compared with the speed of 1,5 m min. of the method employing injection nozzles. In Fig.3 there is shown in a diagrammatic manner a system for carrying out one of the impregnation steps illustrated in Fig.2. This system included a pair of take off rolls 26 formed of the foamed resin sheets 10,10 to be sheets impregnated or the partially impregnatedol8,18. These sheets are conveyed, through conventional guide means, to the rollers 28 of a calender, supported by a frame 30, the roller nip being adjustable in a manner known per se.Provided above the calander rollers is a hopper 32, which contains the thermoplastic material heated to a suitable temperature, whereas a control element 34 will permit the hopper opening to be controlled to form the desired layer 12 or 22 of thermoplastic material or bitumen. Downstream from the calender rollers 28, the resin will expand again and is conveyed, for example by means of guide rollers 32 to two take up rolls 38 on which two rolls of partially impregnated foamed resin or finished product are wound, the take up rolls 38 being driven by a conventional driving means 40 and being supported at any time on the frame 30. In order to improve the impregnation it is possible to provide rollers having a toothed surface not shown acting on the resin upstream the calander rollers 28, thereby causing localized compression and expansion actions. Where the thicknesses of the foamed resin to be impregnated are small and there is nevertheless the need of avoiding a contact between the bitumen in a pasty condition and the calender rollers it is possible to use the method diagrammatically illustrated in fig.4. In a first step the impregnation with a bitumen layer 12 of two inner sheets 10a and two outer sheets lOb is performed, the impregnation of the former pair of sheets 10a being complete whereas that of the latter pair of sheets lOb being partial, as indicated in the first step of the method of fig.2. Thus, two fully impregnated sheets 16a and two partially impregnated sheets 18b are obtained.The latter are then upturned and subjected to a separate impregnation with a bitumen layer 22 of the non impregnated portion, as illustrated in the lower part of Fig.4, or they are completely impregnated as outer sheets in a pack of four sheets, of which the inner ones will again lead to fully impregnated sheets 16a, and the outer ones will also lead to fully impregnated sheets 16b. The equipment for carrying out the first step of the method is illustrated in Fig.5, wherein the same references have been used for indicating similar components of the equipment of Fig. 3. This equipment includes, in addition to the means for forming the partially impregnated sheets 44, a further pair of take off rolls 41 from which the inner sheets 47 are unwound, which are intended to be fully impregnated in order to give the finished product 45 which, by passing over the idler rollers 43 is wound on the take up rolls 42 driven by motors 40. Of course, the system can be modified and, if necessary, arranged so as to operate horizontally instead of vertically, in accordance with the production requirements.These changes as well as other possible modifications of the described method will not depart from the scope of the invention.
