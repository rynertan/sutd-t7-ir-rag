# Radiation switch for photoflash unit.

## Abstract
A photoflash unit having a plurality of flashlamps 11 15, 21 25 mounted on a printed circuit board 43 containing circuitry for sequentially igniting the flashlamps in response to successive firing pulses applied thereto. The circuitry includes a plurality of solid state switches 71 74 capable of being activated by radiant energy generated during flashing of lamps located adjacent to respective switches 71 74 . Ini tially, each of the switches has a resistance sufficiently high to provide an open circuit to the applied firing pulses, and after being activated by radiation, the switch undergoes chemical conversion to a conductive state over a finite time interval. The switches are prepared from compositions comprising admixtures of silver carbonate and or silver oxide, silver coated glass beads and a binder the admixtures may also include electrically non conductive particulate solids, such as titanium dioxide, and or silver coated metal beads. The con stituents and proportions of the switch compositions are selected to provide a predetermined conversion time of twelve milliseconds or greater, thereby permitting reliable functioning with comparatively long duration, low voltage firing pulses.
