# BIOLOGICAL WASTEWATER TREATING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A modified activated sludge system is provided wherein wastewater containing BOD₅ and phosphate values is admixed in an initial zone with biomass containing recycled sludge to form a mixed liquor under conditions effecting sorp tion of BOD₅ in the biomass. Subsequently, said mixed liquor is subjected to aeration in an oxidation zone under conditions for effecting oxidation of BOD₅, such that oxidizing agent is incorporated into the oxidation zone at a rate not substantially exceeding the rate of oxidation. By such operation, consider able savings in power requirements for oxygen transfer to the mixed liquid are had, while developing and maintaining a dense non bulking biomass having the properties of good removal of phosphate from the wastewater influent.
