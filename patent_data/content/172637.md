# Robot hand for stacking boxes.

## Abstract
A robot hand for stacking boxes V, Z comprises pivoted arms F₁, F₂ having hook portions k₁, k₂ which engage flanges ion a box to lift the box. The arms F₁, F₂ are rotated apart to drop the box V in position on a lower box Z. By positioning the hook portion k₁, k₂ at different heights the box V is held at a slant so that a first lower corner of a projection 14 of the box V can be engaged with the underneath box Z, internally of the flange t₁, before releasing the suspended box V by rotating the hook F₂. Hook F₁ serves to limit sideways movement of the box as hook F₂ is released. The invention provides for more positive location of boxes during stacking without the vibration and shock experienced in the prior art method where both hooks are released at the same time to drop the box, the hook portions being at the same height.
