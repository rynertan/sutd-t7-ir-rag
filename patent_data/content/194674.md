## Description
The invention relates to a multiplex transmission system according to the pre characterizing part of claim 1. With increase in the number of electrical equipments and appliances to be disposed at various points of a vehicle, such as an air conditioner, a cruising controller, an intermittently operating wiper, and a variety of lamps, the wiring harness for interconnecting such equipments and appliances tends to have increased number of wires and hence to be enlarged in size, thus lowering the design feasibility, productivity, fittability, and maintenability of wiring harness, while raising indirect costs such as for control and storage. In conjunction with such problems, there is a growing tendency of employing a multiplex transmission system in which a plurality of multiplex harness control devices hereinafter called nodes are connected loop like by at least one wiring harness and the signal transmission and reception thereamong is effected in a multiplex manner. Some examples of such multiplex transmission system for vehicles are disclosed in Jidosha Gijutsu Automobile Technology Vol. 38, No. 2, published 1984, at pages 215 to 221. This reference includes comments on a number of types of multiple transmission system, as follows. According to the reference, multiplex transmission systems are classified into several types by the system of multiplexing, control, communication, and synchronization. As multiplexing system, there are enumerated a time division system and a wavelength division system, besides others the former being suitable for multiplexing those transmission systems in which a wiring harness is employed as a signal transmission line, and the latter, for those in which an optical fiber is employed as a signal transmission line. As control system, typically there are two a centralized control system in which principally a single node is responsible for the control of entire system, and a distributed control system in which the control of a system is equally shared among a plurality of nodes. However, as a hybrid of typical systems, there may well exist a variety of control systems that are unable to be fairly classified into either of typical two. As communication system, generally there are two a parallel line system in which a signal of address and a signal of detection and control data are transmitted through separated lines, and a serial line system in which such signals are transmitted through a single line. In either system, there is additionally provided a power line with which respective nodes are connected loop like. The serial line system usually appears as either a message system in which an address signal and a detection and control data signal are combined to be transmitted as a single message, or a time slot system in which an address signal is omitted while transmitting a series of detection and control data signals in a predetermined sequence. As synchronization system, there are employed two an internal clock system in which respective nodes have clocks thereof, and an external clock system in which a clock signal is generated at a particular node and supplied therefrom to other nodes. In the latter system, the particular that is adapted to generate and supply the clock signal is to govern the other nodes. Thus, this system may well be regarded as a variation of the centralized control system. In this respect, in the centralized system, an entire system may be shut down with troubles at a master node. As control system for the multiplex transmission system, therefore, the distributed control system is preferred to be employed, though in this case there is a desideratum to be attained by devising a communication system to avoid confusion of signal transmission among respective nodes. Incidentally, when performing control of a load as an electrical equipment or appliance, it sometimes becomes necessary to execute a logical process in addition to on off control of a single switch. Exemplarily, in the case of a vehicle, there are adduced reasons such as that some loads are required to have their patterns of action selectable depending on various positions of an ignition switch, such as on , off , park , and lock positions and some loads such as a tail lamp are needed to be operable for on off control from a plurality of switches such as a tail switch and a parking switch. For such reasons, in general, in a time division multiplex transmission system according to a distributed control system, each node is constituted with 1 a combination of a transmitter and a receiver connected both to a wiring harness 2 a detection circuit such as a sensor or a switch put under control of the node 3 a drive circuit such as a relay or a power switch for starting a load such as a pump or a lamp put under control of the node 4 a logic circuit connected to the detection circuit and the drive circuit 5 a combination of a multiplexer and a demultiplexer for interconnecting the logic circuit with the transmitter and the receiver and 6 a control circuit connected to, to cooperate with, the multiplexer and the demultiplexer and adapted for signal transmission to and reception from the wiring harness. In the accompanying drawings, Fig. 6 is a schematic representation of a time division multiplex transmission system for vehicles of such a type as suggested from the level of art described. In the Figure, designated by reference character 200 is the multiplex transmission system, which employs a centralized control system as the control system, a message type serial line system as the communication system, and an internal clock system as the synchronization system. The multiplex transmission system 200 is constituted with n ordinary nodes 200 1 to 200 n each respectively having such circuitries as 1 6 above, and a bilateral signal transmission path wiring harness consisting a transmission line 211 with which the nodes 201 to 205 are connected loop like. The node 200 1 is now supposed to be a master node adapted to supply a polling signal to the remaining nodes 200 2 to 200 n. In the multiplex transmission system 200, from the respective nodes 200 1 to 200 n various signals thereof are sequentilly transmitted to the signal transmission line 211, in a controlled manner, which sequence of signal transmission is considered to be of such a system as shown in Fig. 7. In this respect, each of the nodes 200 1 to 200 n shall be provided with an internal clock for measuring a time base Tb employed for timing the signal transmission, and adapted to transmit, of any data, 4 bits within time interval of time base Tb. In general, data length is given in terms of a unit of 8 bits, which means each unit length of data is transmitted within a period of 2 Tb. A situation is now considered, where, while a series of polling signals P Incidentally, to avoid complicatedness, in Fig. 7, there are shown no more than those signals transmitted from nodes 200 1, 200 2, 200 3, and 200 4. From the master node 200 1, a polling signal P₂ appointing the node 200 2 of which signals are not shown is first transmitted. The polling signal P₂ is a signal of 1 byte to be transmitted within the period 2 Tb. After having transmitted the polling signal P₂, the master node 200 1 monitors, for a reception monitoring time Tm, whether or not signal transmission is performed from the node 200 2. Such monitoring time Tm may preferably be determined to be the time base Tb times 2m where m is an arbitrary integer, such that m 2 , in consideration of the necessary time till initiation of signal transmission from voluntary node 200 i to be appointed by a polling signal P When the monitoring time Tm has elapsed, the master node 200 1 judges that the node 200 2 will not perform signal transmission, and transmits signals of own address a₁ and necessary data d. The signals a₁ and d are supposed to be of a 1 byte length, respectively. Also the signals a₁ and d are transmitted, depending on the internal clock of the master node 200 1. The other nodes 200 2 to 200 n receive the signals a₁ and d, to thereby execute their processes, as necessary. After lapse of a monitoring time Tm from transmission of the signals a₁ and d, the master node 200 1 transmits a polling signal P₃ appointing the node 200 3. The node 200 3 receives the polling signal P₃ and, after lapse of a transmission monitoring time tm at the slave node side, tries to transmit signals of own address a₃ and necessary data d. However, at the node 200 3, of which internal clock is not synchronized with that of the master node 200 1, an extra time Tw₁ is further consumed from the time point where the monitoring time tm has elapsed, before the node 200 3 transmits the signals of own address a₃ and necessary data d. The signals a₃ and d are supposed to be of a 1 byte length, respectively. Also the signals a₃ and d are transmitted, depending on the internal clock of the node 200 3. The master node 200 1 receives the signals a₃ and d, and executes necessary processes. The time required for such process generally is extremely short, when compared with the time base Tb. After lapse of a monitoring Tm from reception of the signals a₃ and d, the master node 200 1 tries to transmit a polling signal P₄ appointing the node 200 4. However, at the master node 200 1, of which internal clock is not synchronized with that of the node 200 4, an extra time Tw₂ is further consumed from the time point where the monitoring time Tm has elapsed, before actual transmission of the polling signal P₄. Here, it is supposed that the internal clock of the node 200 4 happens to be synchronized with that of the master node 200 1. Therefore, the node 200 4 is permitted to transmit signals of own address a₄ and necessary data d after lapse of the transmission monitoring time tm at the shave node side from reception of the polling signal P₄. Like this, in the multiplex transmission system 200, the transmission and reception of signal among the respective nodes 200 1 to 200 n are performed in a cyclic manner, on the basis of polling signal P In the multiplex transmission system 200, however, on the signal transmission line 211 there are transmitted, in addition to signals of own address a In this respect, the signal transmission system 200 may advantageously be modified such that, depending on address signal a According to such modification, the polling signal P However, even when such modification is applied to the multiplex transmission system 200, if the internal clocks of the nodes 200 1 to 200 n are not synchronized thereamong, there arises the problem that, upon signal transmission at the respective nodes 200 1 to 200 n, such time intervals as the extra times Tw₁ and Tw₂ of Fig. 7 are needed to be consumed vain. Moreover, in the multiplex transmission system 200, the order or time point of signal transmission of respective slave nodes 200 2 to 200 n is determined by the polling signal P In GB A 2 020 515 a multiplex transmission system is proposed, comprising a plurality of nodes each connected to an electrical equipment and a signal transmission path connecting said nodes. Each of said nodes comprises transmitting and receiving means for transmitting and receiving combined signals to or from said transmission path and controlling means for controlling said transmission receiving means and said electrical equipment. Said controlling means further comprises timing means and synchronizing means. Each of said nodes is adapted to perform signal transmission in a predetermined node sequence and timing under the control of said timing means. If a signal is transmitted to said transmission path, the timing means of all nodes are stopped and reset after having received the address signal under control of said synchronizing means to thereby synchronize the timing means of all nodes. Only when the channel inactive state of the signal transmission path is indicated, the timing means restart again. After receipt of the address signal, the timing means are synchronized after the data signal has been completely transmitted and the signal transmission path is again in its channel inactive state. The data signal, the address signal of which causes synchronization, thus is transmitted on the basis of the old synchronization. In the multiplex transmission system disclosed in GB A 2 202 515, the signal transmission path is reserved for the respective transmitting node, until same is released again. Furthermore, the known multiplex transmission system works with a bus type signal transmission path. In case of such a transmission path, it has to be taken into consideration that due to the run time differences of the synchronizing signal the timing means of the individual nodes are not completely identically synchronized. As in such a bus type signal transmission path it may happen that the last synchronizing signal is transmitted by a node at one end of the transmisison path, the next data signal, however, by a node at the other end of the transmission path, the transmission rate has to be reduced such that the adding run time differences cannot have any effects on the signal recognition for either of the nodes. It is the object of the present invention, to provide a multiplex transmission system which guarantees a reliable signal recognition even at high signal transmission rates. This object is solved in that said signal transmission path connects said nodes in a loop configuration, that said timing means comprises continuously operating time base measuring means for repetitively measuring a time base as basis for said timing of signal transmission and that each of said nodes, immediately after having received said address signal as part of said combined signal, and after having reset said timing means, also restarts said time base measuring means. In a multiplex transmission system having a loop type signal transmission path, the emitted signal always passes the transmission path in a predetermined travelling direction. This is achieved in that a switch, usually provided at each node in a loop type signal transmission path, is opened as the transmitting node occurs and closed for all other nodes receiving nodes . If an address signal is transmitted via such a loop type signal transmission path for synchronizing the timing means, and if the time base measuring means of the receiving nodes are restarted immediately upon receipt of the prepared signal, the following advantages are obtained These two advantages contribute to the fact that the transmission rate may be increased without any problems, while there is still a reliable signal recognition. The use of a loop type transmission path furthermore bears the advantage of enabling a malfunction diagnosis of the signal transmission path, wherein the signal received by the transmission node, which was emitted by said transmission node, and has travelled along the complete signal transmission path, is compared to the emitted signal. DE A 33 28 834 describes a multiplex transmission system comprising a plurality of nodes, each connected to a respective electrical equipment, and a signal transmission path connecting said nodes. Each of said nodes comprises transmitting means, receiving means and controlling means. Each of said nodes is adapted to perform signal transmission in a predetermined node sequence. Signal transmission path connects nodes in a loop configuration. There are no indications contained in DE A 33 28 834 concerning synchronization of the nodes. The subclaims describe preferred and advantageous embodiments of the inventive multiplex transmission system. In the following a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described more in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Referring first to Fig. 1, designated at reference numeral 100 is a time division multiplex transmission system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The multiplex transmission system 100 comprises a first to an n th nodes N₁ to N The nodes N₁ to N Description of circuit constitution will now be made only of the first node N₁ that is adpated to initially serve as a temporary master node when the entire system 100 is powered on. In this connection it is advised that, as described, the respective nodes N₁ to N The node N₁ comprises a transmitter 2 connected to the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b through a pair of signal output lines 2a, 2b adapted for outputting to supply to both of the transmission lines 1a, 1b a combined signal consisting of a signal of own address of the node N₁ and a signal of data therefrom also combination signal in the following text , a receiver 3 connected to the transmission lines 1a, 1b and adapted to recieve from the lines 1a, 1b any signal that is transmitted therethrough to the node N₁, a switching circuit 4 installed in, for breaking and making, as required, a part of the bilateral transmission path consisting of the transmission lines 1a, 1b, a diagnosis circuit 6 for checking to diagnose whether or not the content of a signal received by the node N₁ from either of the transmission lines 1a, 1b is equal to that of the combination signal as concurrently transmitted from the node N₁ itself to the lines 1a, 1b, and a control circuit 5 connected for control purpose to the transmitter 2, the receiver 3, the switching circuit 4, and the diagnosis circuit 6 as well as to those electrical equipments and appliances not shown which are put under control of the node N₁, the control circuit 5 being provided with various necessary devices such as an I O input output interface, a ROM read only memory , a RAM random access memory , and a CPU central processing unit . The transmitter 2 is adapted, any time when supplying information therefrom through the signal output lines 2a, 2b to the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b, to concurrently output therefrom either of a pair of signals of the same content to both of the transmission lines 1a, 1b. In this respect, however, the output lines 2a, 2b are separated from each other even in the transmitter 2. The receiver 3 includes a pair of signal input terminals 3a, 3b connected to the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b, respectively, and a single reception terminal 3c adapted to be selectively connected to one of the input terminals 3a, 3b. The reception terminal 3c of the receiver 3 is connected, through unshown receiver elements, to the control circuit 5 and the diagnosis circuit 6 and adapted, when the system 100 is started, to be first connected to the input terminal 3a. The switching circuit 4 comprises a pair of normal close type switches 4a, 4b installed in the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b, respectively, for breaking and making, as required, such respective parts thereof that are stretched across the node N₁ itself. More particularly, the switches 4a, 4b are opened while the node N₁ is caused to transmit a signal therefrom to the transmission lines 1a, 1b, and kept closed while the node N₁ is left as it is devoted to signal reception from the lines 1a, 1b. The diagnosis circuit 6 is adapted to inform the control circuit 5 of abnormalities in the signal transmission line 1a or 1b and at any of the other nodes N₂ to N The control circuit 5 is adapted, while the node N₁ is put in a signal transmitting state thereof, to have the transmitter 2 transmit a signal, keeping the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 as they are opened. It is advised in this connection that during such time interval, although the reception terminal 3c of the receiver 3 is connected to the control circuit 5, no direct signal is input from the terminal 3c to the circuit 5. Moreover, in a signal receiving and conducting state of the node N₁, in which a signal transmitted from any of the other nodes N₂ to N The control and the diagnosis circuits 5, 6 are adapted to cooperate with each other to constitute a control process unit of the node N₁. For the remaining nodes N₂ to N In the multiplex transmission system 100, after lapse of a predetermined time from application of power thereto, the node N₁ is first caused to rise, that is, to start transmitting a signal. Thereafter, the remaining nodes N₂ to N In this respect, the multiplex transmission system 100 is adapted such that the node to come to the next of i th node N It will be comprehended that, while any N Fig. 2A is a time chart of respective address signals A Upon the application of power to the transmission system 100, each node N Incidentally, each node N There will be described below respective functions of the time counters CNT₁ and CNT₂. The synchronizing counter CNT₁ of each node N The triggering and supervising counter CNT₂ of each node N Incidentally, the function of the foregoing flags F₁, F₂, F₃, and F₄ will be described later in conjunction with Fig. 5. Further, in the time chart of Fig. 2A, there are exemplarily shown various mutual relations of the timing for transmission of respective address signals A₁, A₂, A₃ and data signals D from the first, second, and third nodes N₁, N₂, and N₃ to the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b, as well as associated time out points of respective synchronizing counters CNT₁ of the nodes N₁, N₂, N₃. Though, practically, in line with the count by these counters CNT₁ there being made also the count by respective triggering and supervising counters CNT₂ of the nodes N₁, N₂, N₃, Fig. 2 has omitted representation of the latter to avoid complicatedness, except for an initial time out point T₁₄ of the counter CNT₂ at the first node N₁. At the respective nodes N₁ to N In this connection, upon completion of the initialization process, the counter CNT₂ of each node N Incidentally, though limitted to the first to fourth nodes N₁ to N₄, the preset length of respective rise timing intervals t As a result, the rise timing interval t Incidentally, at such time point, the node N₁ has already started the counter CNT₁ thereof, as shown in Fig. 2A. In the time chart of Fig. 2A, like the case of other Figures, arrow marks plotted on the time axes of the counters CNT₁ represent respective time points where the counters CNT₁ have timed out. After lapse of a monitoring interval t₁ as a double of the time base interval ½t₁ from the time out point T₁₄ of the counter CNT₂ of the first node N₁, this node N₁ is triggered to transmit therefrom address signal A₁ followed by data signal D to the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b, while having and holding the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 opened. The address signal A₁ of the first node N₁ is then received together with the data signal D thereof by the node N₁ itself, at the reception terminal 3c of its own receiver 3, and read into the diagnosis circuit 6. During such signal transmitting state of the node N₁, respective switches 4a, 4b of switching circuits 4 of the remaining nodes N₂ to N In this connection, it is now advised that the address signal A Moreover, it is advised that, in the transmission system 100, each of the address and the data signals A Further, at each node N In the time chart of Fig. 2A, a time point where the respective synchronizing counters CNT₁ are reset with the address signal A₁ from the first node N₁ is marked on the time axes of the second and third nodes N₂ and N₃, at r₂ and r₃, respectively. It will be easily understood that, at the same time point, also the counters CNT₁ of the remaining nodes N₄ to N With complete data signal D transmitted from the first node N₁, the respective nodes N₂ to N On the other hand, with the address signal A₁ received from the first node N₁, each of the nodes N₂ to N Here, only the second node N₂ judges, according to its address pointer, that its own signal transmission should be made next. Each of the remaining nodes N₃ to N Moreover, the node N₂, after the judgment that the order of its own signal transmission should come next, again increments the address pointer just before the signal transmission of its own. It should be noted that, also in the case of any other node N At the first node N₁, after the transmission of the combination signal of the address and the data signals A₁, D, there is made by the diagnosis circuit 6 a judgment whether or not the same signal as the combination signal that the node N₁ has just transmitted to both of the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b is received from selected one of the lines 1a, 1b, that is, from the line 1a in this case by the node N₁ itself, while the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 are both closed. If the same signal is not received, whereby detection is made of an abnormality of one 1a of the signal transmission lines 1a, 1b such as disconnection thereof or unexpected disturbance thereto or an abnormality of any other node N It is now advised that such diagnosis for abnormalities and addition of abnormality information data are likewise performed at each of the remaining nodes N₂ to N After lapse of the monitoring interval t₁ as double of the time base interval ½t₁ from the completion of signal transmission of the first node N₁, the second node N₂ has switches 4a, 4b of switching circuit 4 thereof opened and starts signal transmission thereof, that is, transmission of a combination signal consisting of an address signal A₂ and a data signal D of a 2 byte length. Upon completion of signal transmission from the second node N₂, the other nodes N₁ and N₃ to N At each of the nodes N₁ and N₃ to N At the second node N₂, after transmission of the address and the data signals A₂, D, the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 are both closed. Then, with rise timing interval t₂₄ set on the counter CNT₂, the node N₂ enters a waiting state thereof, where it waits signal transmission from any of the remaining nodes N₁ and N₃ to N After lapse of the monitoring interval t₁ from the completion of signal transmission of the second node N₂, the third node N₃ has switches 4a, 4b of switching circuit 4 thereof opened and starts signal transmission thereof, that is, transmission of a combination signal consisting of an address signal A₃ and a data signal D of a 3 byte length. Hereafter, the fourth to n th nodes N₄ to N In the signal transmission cycle described, the triggering and supervising counter CNT₂ of any node N In a case where certain node N Exemplarily, in such a case that the n th node N Likewise, even in the case where the first node N₁ is failing to rise for certain reason, the counter CNT₂ of the second node N₂ times out when the address monitoring interval t₂₄ has elapsed after reception of address signal A As will be understood, in cases where arbitrary one N In this connection, in the multiplex transmission system 100, each node N More particularly, in the system 100 in which in dependence on address signal A In this respect, normally, with the address pointer pointing at one A At each node N The aforementioned correction of address table at each node N is executed in such a manner as will be described below with respect to a particular case. As a comprehensible example, there is now supposed a case where, even after completion of signal transmission from the second node N₂, the third node N₃ will not rise. Upon the completion of signal transmission from the second node N₂, at each of the respective nodes N₁, N₂, and N₄ to N In the present case, however, as aforementioned in conjunction with Fig. 3, as the next node there comes the first node N₁ to rise at a time point where the sum of the address monitoring interval t₁₄ and the monitoring interval t₁ has elapsed from the completion of signal transmission of the second node N₂, thus first transmitting therefrom the address signal A₁. At each of the remaining nodes N₂ and N₄ to N In the first node N₁, at a time point where the counter CNT₂ on which the address monitoring interval t₁₄ and a later desribed address monitoring interval t₁₃ are set times out, the third address A₃ that has been pointed at till then by the address pointer in the address table is deleted from the address table, thereby shortening this table by one byte, and the address pointer is moved so as to point at the first address A₁ corresponding to the first node N₁ itself. In the case in concern where the third node N₃ is failing to rise, therefore, as a result of such correction of address table, the remaining nodes N₁, N₂, and N₄ to N In this connection, in cases where certain node N Fig. 2B is a time chart for describing, in cases where, among the respective nodes N₁ to N In other words, there is supposed such a condition that only the data signal D of the first node N₁ is kept from being transmitted. Incidentally, upon reception of address signal A In the present case, the first node N₁ of which data signal D is predetermined to be one byte in word length corresponds to the node N At each node N Such time out point of the counter CNT₂ is marked on associated time axis of each node N Moreover, at each node N Then, at each node N Here, only the second node N₂ judges that the signal transmission of the node N₂ itself should be performed next. Each of the remaining nodes N₃ to N Further, at the second node N₂, the address pointer is again incremented, just before the signal transmission of the node N₂ itself. Then, at a time point where the time base interval ½t₁ has elapsed from the time out point marked at U₂ or U₃, the second node N₂ opens switches 4a, 4b of switching circuits 4 thereof and starts signal transmission. Thereafter, the remaining nodes N₃ to N Fig. 2C is a time chart for describing, in cases where, among the respective nodes N₁ to N In other words, there is supposed such a condition that only the data signal D of the n 1 th node N In this connection, it is further supposed that, among respective combination signals to be transmitted from the nodes N₁ to N In the present case, upon reception of the address signal A At each node N For the first node N₁, such time out point of the counter CNT₂ is marked at U₁₂ on associated time axis in Fig. 2C. It will be understood that, in any other node N Moreover, at each node N Then, at each node N Here, however, the node next to come to perform its own signal transmission inherently is n th one N In the case in concern, however, the n th node N After lapse of the monitoring interval t₁ from the time out point U₁₃ above, at the first node N₁, the address pointer is set so as to point at the address A₁ of the node N₁ itself. Then, with the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 opened, the node N₁ starts signal transmission thereof, whereas the address pointer of the node N₁ is again incremented just before the signal transmission. Thereafter, the remaining nodes N₂ to N Referring now to Figs. 4A to 4C and 5, description will be collectively made of flows of control programmed, in respective control circuits 5 of the nodes N₁ to N It should be noted that, for easy understanding, the flow is now supposed as such one that belongs to particular one N With power applied, the flow starts at a stage 50, and various initialization processes are executed at a stage 51. Next, at a stage 52, the input terminal 3a of the receiver 3 is selected for signal reception. Then, at a stage 53 , the counter CNT₁ is reset. Further, at a stage 54, the counter CNT₂ has set thereon a time k t In this respect, when the counter CNT₂ has set thereon the monitoring interval t₂, t With respect to the counters CNT₁ and CNT₂, supplementary description will follow. The counter CNT₁ is adapted, when once reset, to send one pulse to an interrupt terminal not shown of the CPU of the control circuit 5 every time when the interval ½t₁ has elapsed, and the counter CNT₂ is adapted to send one pulse to another interrupt terminal not shown of the CPU when the time interval t₂, t A pair of sub routines for handling such interruption are shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, respectively. The sub routine shown in Fig. 4B is adapted to handle the interruption from the counter CNT₁. In this interrupt handler, at a stage 95b, additional interrupt is first disabled. Then, at a stage 95c, the time out flag F₁ for measuring the time base interval ½t₁ is set to 1 , irrespective of the state that the flag F₁ then has. Thereafter, at a stage 95d, interrupt is enabled, then the flow returns from a stage 95e to the main control routine. The sub routine of Fig. 4C is adapted to handle the interruption from the counter CNT₂. In this interrupt handler also, at a stage 96b, additional interrupt is first disabled. Then, at a stage 96c, that one F Returning now to Fig. 4A, continued description will be made of the control flow. After necessary processes at the stage 54, while going round a triple of decision stages 55, 66, and 68, the flow as well as the node N If received during the idling state, address signal A On the other hand, during the idling state, if the address monitoring flag F₄ as set to 1 is detected at the stage 66, the flow goes to a stage 67, where it first judges whether or not the start flag is set to 0 . If the start flag is judged to be 0 , the flow goes, after having the start flag set to 1 , simply to a later described stage 74. In the case where the start flag is judged to be 1 , the address table is corrected and the address pointer is set so as to point at the address A Likewise, during the idling state while the flow is going round the stages 55, 56, 68, if the address monitoring flag F₃ as set to 1 is detected at the stage 68, the flow goes to a stage 69, where the address table is corrected and the address pointer is set so as to point at the address A As described, when judged existing at the stage 55, any address signal A Next, at a stage 58, it is judged whether or not the address signal A At the stage 59, the counter CNT₂ has set thereon the data monitoring interval t₂ of a length that depends on the address signal A Subsequently thereto, while going round a pair of decision stages 60, 70, the flow as well as the node N If received during this idling state, data signal D is read at a stage 61. On the other hand, during this idling state, if the data monitoring flag F₂ as set to 1 is detected at the stage 70, the flow goes to a stage 71, where the counter CNT₂ has set thereon the address monitoring interval t Then, at a stage 72, the address pointer is incremented and, at a stage 73, there is made a judgment whether or not the order of signal transmission of the flow or the node N In the case where the order of its own signal transmission is judged to come next, the flow goes to a later described stage 76. To the contrary, if its own order is judged not to come next, the flow goes to the decision stage 55 to enter the idling state, where it now waits a data signal D from that node N As described, when judged existing at the stage 60, data signal D is read at the stage 61 then, at a stage 62, the counter CNT₂ has set thereon the address monitoring interval t Moreover, at a stage 63, necessary signal processes are executed in accordance with the content the signals A Upon completion of processes at the stage 63, the flow goes to a stage 64, where the address pointer is incremented to thereby again judge, at a stage 65, whether or not the order of signal transmission of the flow or the node N In the case where, at the stage 65, the order of its own signal transmission is judged to come next, the flow goes to the stage 74. To the contrary, if its own order is judged not to come next, the flow goes to the decision stage 55 to enter the idling state, where it now waits an address signal A Incidentally, at the stages 56 and 61, the address signal A At the stage 74, while idling, the flow is kept waiting till the time base measuring flag F₁ is set to 1 . When the flag F₁ has become 1 , the flow goes to a stage 76, where it resets the flag F₁ to 0 . Thereafter, at stages 76 and 77, the time base interval ½t₁ is consumed. Then, at a stage 78, the address pointer is incremented. As will be understood, it is only when the order of signal transmission of the flow or the node N After having passed as an approach toward such transmission a stage 79 where the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 are opened, the flow comes to a stage 80 where its own address signal A Upon completion of the signal transmission at the stage 80, the flow goes to a stage 81 where the switches 4a, 4b of the switching circuit 4 are closed. Then, at stages 82 and 83, a judgment is made of the transmitted signals A In the case where they are judged both equal, the flow goes to a stage 84, where the counter CNT₂ has set thereon the address monitoring interval t If either of the transmitted signals A When the flag F Then , at a stage 87, the input terminal 3b is selected in place of the terminal 3a to be connected to the reception terminal 3c of the receiver 3. Then, at a stage 88, the counter CNT₂ has set thereon a time interval of t Thereafter, the flow goes to the stage 55, where it again waits an address signal A Incidentally, in the multiplex transmission system 100, each N Moreover, in the multiplex transmission system 100, which may well be said as of a distributed control system in a sense, when address signal A In this respect, more particularly, the counter CNT₁ is adapted to be reset every time when having received address signal A Moreover, at the counter CNT₂ any node N When the address monitoring interval t Accordingly, even when, with an abnormality arising at any node N Incidentally, such advantages are resides in that the counter CNT₂ functions as a monitoring timer. It will be understood that those monitoring systems in which an address or data signal is monitored by setting various monitoring time intervals are advantageously applicable also to a multiplex transmission system which employs a unilateral signal transmission path instead of bilateral one.
