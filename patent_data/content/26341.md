# Method and apparatus for the relaxation of rovings on roving frames.

## Abstract
A roving frame in which tension is reduced in the unwound length of roving 50,52 remaining between the drafting mechanism 10 and the package 32 after the frame has been brought to a halt. This can be done by additional feed from the drafting mechanism after stopping of the other el ments of the frame. The degree of feed may be different depending upon whether the stoppage is due to a break at one of a group of flyers, or to a doffing operation.
