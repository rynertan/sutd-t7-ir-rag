## Description
PURIFICATION OF ESTERS OF ALKANOIC ACIDS This invention belongs to the field of synthetic organic chemistry and provides a process for purifying esters of a certain highly branched alkanoic acid by selective hydrolysis. The present invention operates by the hydrolysis of an alkyl ester of an alkanoic acid with a strong alkali metal base, one of the oldest processes in organic chemistry. The unique feature of the present invention is its ability to hydrolyze selectively the esters of certain alkanoic acids, leaving the corresponding ester of the desired acid intact, to be easily separated from the saponified contaminants. The present invention provides a process for purifying an alkyl ester of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is C2 C5 alkyl provided that each carbon atom in an alkyl R group has at least one hydrogen atom bonded to it which ester is mixed with one or more contaminating alkyl esters of the formulaEMI1.2 wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or methyl R3 is C1 C5 alkyl which process comprises selectively hydrolyzing the contaminating alkyl ester or esters with an alkali metal hydroxide and separating the resulting alkali metal carboxylate. All temperatures in the present document are described in degrees Celsius. The generally named alkyl groups R and R3 used in the above description are described in terms usual in organic chemirstry. R3 may be any alkyl group having not more than five carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, t butyl, isobutyl, s butyl, l ethylpropyl, 1 methylbutyl, 2,2 dimethyl propyl and the like. The group R may be an alkyl group of from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, but it is limited by the requirement that each carbon atom must have at least 1 hydrogen atom bonded to it. Thus, R may not include groups such as t butyl or neopentyl, but includes such typical groups as methyl, methyl, isopropyl, butyl, s butyl, pentyl, 1,2 dimethylpropyl, 3 methylbutyl, l methylbutyl, and 2 methylbutyl. The preferred esters are C3 C5 alkyl esters, wherein R is C2 C4 alkyl, especially C3 C5 branched alkyl esters, and most especially the isobutyl ester, wherein R is isopropyl. The contaminating alkyl esters which are separated by the present process include esters of alkanoic acids such as the following typical examples. 2 methylbutanoic acid, 2, 2 dimethylpentanoic acid, 2 methylhexanoic acid, 2, 4 dimethylpentanoic acid, heptanoic acid, 2,2,4,4 tetramethylpentanoic acid 5 methylhexanoic acid, 2 methyloctanoic acid, 4 methylheptanoic acid, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylhexanoic acid, 2,2,4, 5 tetramethylhexanoic acid. The most important contaminating esters are those wherein R1 and R2 are methyl, and R3 is C2 C3 alkyl. The esters of 2 ethyl 2 methylbutanoic acid, the purification of which is the objective of the present invention, are useful as intermediates for preparing various useful products. Most particularly, they are useful for preparing a series of herbicides which are 5 2, 6 disubstituted benzamido 3 1 ethyl l methylpropyl isoxazoles. Such herbicides have been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,416,683, see Example 1 which shows an alkyl ester of the present tertiary alkanoic acid used as the starting material in the synthesis of a preferred product. The most preferred mixture of esters on which to carry out the present process is obtained by the esterification of a mixed carboxylic acid product obtained from commercial sources. The product contains a major amount of 2 ethyl 2 methylbutanoic acid, and approximately 30 by weight of contaminating carboxylic acids, of which the major one is 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid. The mixed acids are esterified by the usual methods, such as by reaction with an appropriate alkanol with sulfuric acid or toluenesulfonic acid as catalyst, and the mixture of esters is used as the starting material for the purposes of the present invention. The reagent used in the present invention is an alkali metal hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is preferred but potassium and lithium hydroxides may be used if desired. It is preferred to carry out the hydrolysis in a 2 phase reaction mixture. For example, the mixture of esters may be dissolved in a water immiscible organic solvent, and mixed with aqueous alkali metal hydroxide.It is most convenient to choose an organic solvent which boils under ambient pressure at the desired operating temperature of the process, so that the hydrolysis may be carried out under r commat flux. Obviously, however, the process may be operated under pressure if it is desired to operate above the ambient pressure boiling point of the mixture. When a 2 phase reaction mixture is used, it is convenient to use an aromatic reaction solvent, especially a xylene or mixed xylenes, or toluene, since the boiling points of those solvents are convenient for the hydrolysis and they are highly resistant to the strong base. When a water immiscible organic solvent is used in the reaction mixture, it is most convenient to synthesize the initial mixture of esters in that organic solvent. When the hydrolysis is over, isolation of the purified product ester is easy when a 2 phase reaction mixture is used. It is necessary only to separate the layers and, if necessary, wash the organic layer with water. When a 2 phase reaction mixture is used, it is sometimes advantageous to use a phase transfer catalyst in the mixture, particularly when the reaction temperature is comparatively low. The usual types of phase transfer catalysts, such as quarternary ammonium halides, are effective. For example, such phase transfer catalysts as tributylmethylammonium chloride, trimethylphenylammonium iodide, tetrabutylammonium chloride, benzyltriethylammonium methanesulfonate, methylphenyldipropylammonium chloride, butyltrimethylammonium sulfonate and the like may be used as desired It has been found that the addition of a small amount, in the range of several tenths to several mole percent, preferably from about 1 to about 5 of an alkanoic acid can also serve as a catalyst or initiator in the present process. For example, 2,2dimethylpentanoic acid has itself been successfully used for this purpose.Numerous other alkanoic acids may be used, such as acetic acid, butyric acid, heptanoic acid, 2 methylpropanoic acid, 3 ethylpentanoic acid, octanoic acid, 2 methylpentanoic acid, for example.The mechanism is not understood, but the fact is quite useful, especially when a relatively low reaction temperature is used. If a l phase reaction mixture is desired, it is preferred to use an aqueous alkanol, such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, and the like as solvent. The selective hydrolysis which is the basis of the present invention occurs in such a mixture, but the isolation of the purified ester from the saponified contaminants is obviously more difficult, and so operation in a single phase mixture is not preferred. The amount of base to be used in the hydrolysis varies from about 1 to about 15 equivalents, based on the total of the mixture of esters submitted to the process. It is more preferred to use from about 1 to about 5 equivalents, and most preferred to use from about 1 to about 2 equivalents under the most highly preferred conditions. The reaction temperature can be varied between about 600 and about 2000, preferably between about 1000 and about 1600. It is obvious that the amount of reagent, the reaction temperature and the reaction time must always be balanced for the best results in any organic chemical process. In the present instance, the product ester is hydrolyzed to some extent under the reaction conditions, although it is selectively hydrolyzed to a lesser extent than are the contaminating esters. Thus, the maximum yield of the desired ester depends on balancing the conditions for the maximum selectivity, i.e., minimal hydrolysis of the desired product. It has been found that it is preferable to operate at a relatively high temperature, with a relatively small amount of base and for a short reaction time, as the examples reported below demonstrate.The most highly preferred temperature is about 1400, for about 1 2 hours in the presence of about 1 2 equivalents of the alkali metal hydroxide, in a 2 phase reaction mixture. No phase transfer catalyst or added alkanoic acid is needed in the most highly preferred conditions, but the use of such an additive is useful when the process is operated at lower temperatures in the range of about 60 120 , for example. However, the examples below also demonstrate that useful purification is obtained at other operating conditions. Reaction times as long as 8 hours have been satisfactorily used, at lower temperatures such as 60 800, and much larger amounts of base than the most preferred amounts have also successfully been used. It will be understood that the exact optimum operating conditions will vary as different ester mixtures are submitted to the process. Depending on the relative amount of more highly hindered or less highly hindered contaminating esters, more,or less stringent reaction conditions will be demanded. Accordingly, the reader must realize that some small amount of experimentation will usually be needed to find the optimum operating conditions for a given feed stock.The examples below clear ly explain the type of experiments which are cailed for, and it will be seen that the experiments can be planned and carried out by any organic chemist. The invention is further explained by the following examples. The ultimate starting material for all of the examples was a commercial C 7 acid mixture containing approximately 70 by weight of 2 ethyl2 methylbutanoic acid, 26 of 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid and 4 of 2,2,3 trimethylbutanoic acid. The ratio of the three esters in the ester mixtures used in the examples below was the same as the ratio in the acid mixture, unless otherwise stated. The following preparation of the mixed esters is typical. Preparation 1 Isobutyl esters of commercial C 7 acid mixture A 5 liter flask was fitted with a Dean Stark trap, a condenser and a stirrer. To it were charged 1302 g. of commercial C 7 acid mixture, 815 g. of isobutanol, 133 g. of toluenesulfonic acid and 1000 ml. of xylene. The mixture was heated for about 20 hours while the water formed in the reaction was removed by azeotropic distillation. The mixture was then cooled and the organic layer was Separated and washed with 500 ml. of water, with three 300 ml. portions of 10 aqueous sodium carbonate, and again with 500 ml. of water. The washed organic layer was then dried by azeotropic distillation. The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography using an instrument equipped with a capillary injector, a flame ionization detector and a 30 meter x 0.3 mm. OV 101 fused silica capillary column. The injector and detector temperatures were 275 , the flow rate 2 ml. minute, the split ratio 75 1 and the injection volume 0.5 mcl. The sample concentration was 40 mg. ml. in dichloromethane and the internal standard was 8 mg. ml. dodecane. The product layer was found to contain 1746 g.of total esters, a yield of 93.7 of the theoretical yield. It contained 45.5 of isobutyl 2 ethyl 2 methylbutanoate, 16.6 of isobutyl 2, 2 dimethylpentanoate, 2.81 of 2,3,3 trimethylbutanoate and 35.1 of xylene. The above analytical method is useful for the hydrolyzed ester product, as well, and was used to analyze most of the following examples. The first group of examples of purifications according to the present process demonstrate hydrolysis in single phase reaction systems. Example 1 Five g. of isobutyl esters of the commercialC 7 acid mixture was isolated by distillation from an esterification in cyclohexane with sulfuric acid as the catalyst, and was mixed with 4.5 g. of solid potassium hydroxide and 10 ml of denatured ethanol. The mixture was heated under reflux with stirring, and samples were taken after 5 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, and 2 hours of treatment. The samples were analyzed and it was found that the ester of 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid had substantially disappeared after 20 minutes of reflux. Example 2 Five g. of mixed isobutyl esters, prepared as described in Example 1, was combined with 10 ml. of 5N sodium hydroxide and 15 ml. of ethanol, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 hours. Analysis of the reaction mixture by chromatography showed that the ratio of the amount of the desired ester to the ester of 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid was 83 17. Example 3 The process of Example 2 was followed again, but for longer periods of time. After 5 hours, the ratio of the desired product to the isobutyl 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 84.1 15.9, and after 7 hours, the ratio was 90.5 9.5. Example 4 The process of Example 2 was carried out again, with a 4 hour reflux time. Chromatographic analysis of the mixture showed that the ratio of the desired ester to the 2,2 dimethylpentan commat ate was 85 15 3.1 g. of the desired ester was found in the reaction mixture. Example 5 The process of Example 2 was used again, except that the reflux time was 5 hours. Analysis identified 3.16 g. of the desired ester in the reaction mixture, together with 0.38 g. of the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate, a ratio of 89.4 10.6. The following examples report hydrolyses carried out in toluene. Example 6 A 14.2 g. portion of a toluene solution of isobutyl esters of the commercial C 7 acid mixture, containing 3.53 millimoles of total esters per gram of solution, was combined with 10 ml. of 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 hours. It was then cooled, diluted with 20 ml. of water, and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with a small amount of toluene and the organic layer was combined with the.first organic layer. Chromatographic analysis of the combined organics showed that the product contained 5.25 g. of the desired ester, a yield of 78.6 the ratio of the desired ester to the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 95 5. Example 7 Seventeen g. of a toluene solution of isobutyl esters of the commercial C 7 acid mixture, containing 2.94 millimoles of total esters per gram, was combined with 10 ml. of 15 aqueous sodium hydroxide, and was stirred under reflux for 4 hours. The mixture was worked up as described in Example 6 and the toluene solution was analyzed. The ratio of desired ester to 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 93.7 6.3, and the weight recovery of the desired ester was 80 . Example 8 The process of Example 7 was carried out twice morer once for 6 hours of reflux time and once for 9 hours. Analysis of the 6 hour run indicated that the weight recovery of the desired ester was 72 , and the ratio of the amount of the desired ester to the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 98.3 1.7. At 9 hours, the recovery of the desired ester was 51 . Example 9 The process of Example 6 was repeated, except that samples were taken from the refluxing reaction mixture at various time intervals. Each sample was about 1 ml. of the organic phase, which was washed with 2 ml. of water, dried over sodium sulfate and analyzed.At 1.5 hours, the ratio ofthe amount of the desired ester to the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 78.6 21.4 at 4 hours it was 98.7 1.3 at 7 hours there was no detectable dimethylpentanoate present. Example 10 A 14.2 g. portion of the toluene solution of isobutyl esters from Example 6 was combined with 20 ml.of 5N sodium hydroxide and 30 ml. of denatured ethanol, and the mixture was stirred under reflux, under a nitrogen blanket, for 8 hours. It was a 2 phase mixture. The mixture was then cooled, the phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was washed with 15 ml.of toluene. The organic phases were combined and washed with 15 ml. of water, and the solution was dried over sodium sulfate. Chromatographic analysis indicated that the ratio of the amount of the desired ester to the dimethylpentanoate was 83.9 16.1, and 85.8 of the desired ester was recovered. Example 11 A 51 g. portion of a toluene solution of isobutyl esters of the commercial C 7 acid mixture, containing 2.94 millimoles of total esters per gram of solution, was added to 30 ml. of 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 hours. A similar mixture was run for 6 hours. At the end of the reflux times, the mixtures were cooled and diluted with water, and the phases were separated.The aqueous layer was extracted with toluene, and the combined organics were dried over sodium sulfate and analyzed chromatographically. The product solution from the 4 hour run contained the desired ester and the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate in a ratio of 94.9 5.1, and the recovery of the desired ester was 76.9 . The product solution from the 6 hour run contained the same substances in a ratio of 95.2 4.7, and the recovery of the desired ester was 64.8 . Examples 12 15 Each example was carried out by combining 102.9 g. of a toluene solution of isobutyl esters of commercial C 7 acid mixture, containing 2.43 millimoles of total esters per gram, and in which the ratio of the desired ester to the 2,2 dimethylpentanoate was 61.5 38.5, with 65 ml. of 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide. Various reaction times and temperatures were used. A 4.2 g.portion of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate was added as a phase transfer catalyst. At the end of the reaction time, the mixtures were cooled, and the organic layer was removed and washed twice with 30 ml.portions of water and once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was then dried over sodium sulfate and analyzed chromatographically. The results were shown in the table below as the ratio of the desired ester to the dimethylpentanoate.Example Temperature Time Product 12 Reflux 7 hr. 100 O 13 Reflux z 2 hr. 81 19 r4 Reflux 7 hr. 98 2 15 600 7 hr. 82 18 Examples 16 20 The processes of this group of examples were carried out by adding certain amounts shown in the table below as a ratio with the molar amount of esters of 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide to 21 g. of a toluene solution of isobutyl esters of the commercial C 7 acid mixture, and stirring under reflux for periods of from 1 to 6 hours.

The mixture of esters was then dissolved in xylene to give a concentration of 300 g. of solution per mole of total esters, and the resulting ester solution was hydrolyzed substantially according to the process described in Examples 48 102. The effect of varying amounts of carboxylic acid as catalyst was explored in these examples. The acid was 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid, and the amount of it used is expressed in mole percent in the table below. The table also reports the reaction time in hours, and the amount of base, which was 50 sodium hydroxide, as the number of equivalents per mole of total esters.The results of the experiments are reported in the same way as the examples above.

The mixture of esters was hydrolyzed with 4.26 ml. of 50 sodium hydroxide solution, for one hour at the reflux temperature, substantially as described in the examples above. The total weight of the xylene solution containing the desired ester was 12.4 g., and it was analyzed by liquid chromatography as described above, indicating that the ratio of products was 84 12 4.1, and the recovery of the desired ester was 67.0 . Examples 120 127 The ester mixtures used in this group of examples were dissolved in toluene, and were made by the esterification of the commercial C 7 acid mixture with isobutanol in toluene by a process substantially like that of Preparation 1, except that toluene was used instead of xylene. The concentration of the ester mixture was about 552 ml. mole, and the ratio of the desired ester to the two major contaminants was about 65 32 2.5. Each of the hydrolyses reported in these examples was carried out by adding 50 ml. of 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide to 145 ml. of the ester solution, giving a ratio of 3.8 equivalents of base per mole of total esters. The mixture was vigorously stirred under reflux for a time shown in the table below, and the organic layer was separated, water washed, dried by binary distillation, and analyzed to determine the ratio of the esters remaining and the yield of the desired isobutyl ester of 2 ethyl 2 methylbutanoic acid. The results are reported as they were reported in the examples above. Some of the reaction mixtures were treated with the commercial C 7 acid mixture, or with 2,2dimethylpentanoic acid, or both, as catalysts. Examples 121, 122 and 125 contain 2, 5 and 5 mole percent, respectively, of acid mixture, based on the amount of total ester in the reaction mixture. Examples 123, 126 and 127 contain 2 mole percent of 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid, added as the sodium salt, and Example 124 contained 0.8 mole percent of 2,2 dimethylpentanoic acid, sodium salt, and 4 mole percent of acid mixture.
