## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polymer mixtures comprising polyvinyl chloride and an aromatic polycarbonate are known from German PatentSpecification 24 02 175 and United States Patent Specification 4,239,861 corresponding thereto. As compared with polyvinyl chloride, these mixtures have a better resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures however, the known mixtures are brittle. German PatentApplication 23 04 894 and the United States PatentSpecification 3,882,192 corresponding thereto disclose polymer mixtures which comprise polyvinyl chloride, an aromatic polycarbonate and an ABS graft copolymer or a styrene maleic acid anhydride copolymer or an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. The last mentioned known mixtures have some ductility. The invention provides polymer mixtures on the basis of polyvinyl chloride, an aromatic polycarbonate and an additive whereby the ductility is increased considerably. The new mixtures according to the invention have the further advantage that they can be processed thermoplastically at the temperature usual for polyvinyl chloride, i.e., 170 220 C. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polymer mixture according to the invention is characterized in that it comprises 5 90 by weight of polyvinyl chloride, 10 95 by weight of aromatic polycarbonate and 1 408 by weight of an aliphatic polyester of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein x and y each independently of each other represent an integer of 4 to 12, inclusive and n indicates the degree of polymerization and is from about 10 to 1,000. The polymer mixture according to the invention preferably comprises poly caprolactone PCL as an aliphatic polyester. PCL is known to be compatible with polyvinyl chloride and aromatic polycarbonates for this see J.V. Koleske, R.D. Lundberg, Journal ofPolymer Science, part A2, vol. 7, E. 795 807 1969 and United States Patent Specification 3,781,381, respectively . Polymer mixtures comprising polyvinyl chloride and a polymeric softener are known from United StatesPatent Specification 3,305,605. The polymeric softener consists of an aliphatic polycarbonate which may be copolymerized with caprolactone. The polymer mixtures according to the invention have good mechanical properties, can readily be processed by thermoplastic shaping methods and have a good stability against W light and are thermally stable. The polymer mixtures according to the invention comprise 5 90 by weight, preferably 10 50 by weight of polyvinyl chloride PVC . A PVC content of less than 5 by weight generally leads to commercially less attractive products PVC contents of more than 90 by weight lead to a mixture having too small a resistance to deformation at elevated temperature. The polymer mixtures according to the invention comprise 10 95 by weight, preferably 40 75 by weight of aromatic polycarbonate PC . A PC content of less than 10 by weight leads to mixtures having too small a resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures. The polymer mixtures according to the invention comprise 1 40 by weight, preferably 5 40 by weight, of an aliphatic polyester of the above indicated formula. Examples of suitable polyesters are poly caprolactone , poly hexamethylene sebacate , poly g methyl v n propyl B propriolactone and poly valerolactone . Mixtures comprising less than 1 by weight of the aliphatic polyesters are difficult to process and are brittle by nature a PCL content of more than 40 by weight leads to too strong a softening of the resulting polymer mixture. Poly g caprolactone, i.e., a polymer of the above indicated formula wherein x and y both are 5, is preferably used as an aliphatic polyester in the polymer mixture according to the invention. The aliphatic polyesters of the above indicated formula are compounds known per se they can be prepared by co polymerization of one or more hydroxycarboxylic acids or the lactone thereof. The degree of tolvmerization of such polyesters n in the above formula may vary between 10 andEMI3.1 preferablyEMI3.2 between 100 and 300. Polyvinyl chloride PVC is to be understood to include in this Specification all polymers and copolymers which are built up for at least 70 mole from units derived from vinyl chloride. The vinyl chloride may be copolymerized with, for example, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, vinyl esters, such as vinyl acetate, meth acrylic acid esters , amides and nitrile compounds of meth acrylic acid, maleic acid esters and semi esters, respectively, maleic imide, vinyl ether and olephenic unsaturated hydrocarbons, for example, ethylene, propylene. A PVC having a K value according to Fikentscher, measured in a 1 cyclohexanone solution of 230C of 50 75 is preferaby used. The PVC may be prepared by emulsion, polymerization or suspension, or also mass polymerization. Polyvinyl chlorides which are mixed with stabilizers are preferably used in the polymer mixtures according to the invention. As stabilizers may be used the additives usual for PVC, for example, stabilizers on thebasis of lead, barium cadmium, calcium zinc and organic tin compounds. Aromatic polycarbonates are to be understood to mean homopolycarbonates, copolycarbonates and mixtures of various homo and copolycarbonates which comprise units derived from one or more aromatic compounds having at least two hydroxy groups. Particularly suitable are those polycarbonates which comprise units of bis hydroxyphenyl alkanes, for example, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane or polycarbonates the aromatic nucleus of which is substituted with one or more halogen atoms. Also suitable are aromatic polycarbonates which comprise units derived from 2,2 bis ,3,5 di methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane. The aromatic polycarbonates as used in the polymer mixture according to the invention may have a weight averaged molecular weight of 10,000 200,000, preferably of 14,000 50,000. The polymer mixtures according to the invention may comprise, in addition to the above mentioned constituents, any further additives usual for PVC and PC by name may be mentioned pigments and dyes, additives to obtain flame retarding properties, additives to improve the impact stength, additives to further improve the processability, for example, lubricants and fillers. The polymer mixtures according to the invention may be formed into articles by means of the usual methods for thermoplastic materials. The polymer mixtures are suitable in particular for processing into thin foils. The polymer mixtures according to the invention can be prepared by dry mixing, extrusion, mixing of solutions of the various constituents or while using melt mixing methods. It is to be preferred first to mix the PC with the PCL, for example, by extrusion. A softened PC is then obtained. The resulting softenedPC can be mixed in the PVC at comparatively low temperatures below 220 C , for example, by extrusion. When the PVC would first be mixed with the PCL or when the three components are mixed simultaneously, higher temperatures are necessary at low content of aliphatic polyester to obtain an intimate mixture these higher temperatures above 220 C may result in a decomposition of the PVC. The polymer mixtures according to the invention have the following structure. Due to the compatibility of the aliphatic polyester of the above indicated formula with both PVC and PC, very homogeneous dispersions are obtained. The results of dynamic mechanical measurements give an indication that, in dependence on the relative quantities of PC and PVC, the.structure consists of plasticized PVC dispersed in a continuous phase of plasticized PC when the relative quantity ofPC is larger than that of the PVC or of plasticized PC dispersed in a continuous phase of plasticized PVC. The invention will be described with reference to the following examples EXAMPLES I TO IX Polycarbonate, the homopolymer derived from 2,2bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and phosgene, having a weight averaged molecular weight of 22,500, was mixed in a 30 mm single blade Leistriz extruder at 2400C with poly r caprolactone having a weight averaged molecular weight of 50,000, n of about 100 . The extrudate was ground and mixed with polyvinyl chloride the homopolymer having a K value of 66 at 250C. The polyvinyl chloride was pre mixed with 0.88 by weight of a usual PVC stabilizer an organic tin compound with the indication Harochem T 201 of Messrs. Haagen Chemie B.V. and 0.3 by weight of a usual lubricant AC 316A ofAllied Chemical Company .For the quantities of the polymers used see the following table. For comparison, the examples VIII and IX were carried out without PCL and pure PVC, respectively. Foils having a thickness of 550 micrometer were made from the resulting polymer mixtures on a Collin roller at 185 C. Draw rods were Dunched from the foil.EMI6.1 EMI6.2 The tensile strength upon yielding and rupture and the elongation upon rupture of the rods were determined. The Vicat B value according to DIN 53460 and the hardness shore D were determined on compressed plates having a thickness of 3 mm. The results are recorded in Table A. It can be seen from the results of Table A that the polymer mixtures according to the invention are more ductile than PVC PC mixtures which comprise no polyester, while a higher Vicat B value can be obtained than that of pure PVC Example IX . for comparisonTable AExample I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX Constituent parts by weight PVC 40 30 20 34.8 16.7 15.4 14.3 50 100 PC 51 59.5 68 44.3 56.7 52.3 48.6 50 PCL 9 10.5 12 20.9 26.6 32.3 37.1 Tensile strength at yield point N mmê 52.3 47.5 40.6 no value to be determined Yield point 7 7 7 no valu1e to be determined Tensile strenghth at rupture N mmê 42.9 44.6 50 38 30 34 37 55 42Elongation at rupture 49 45 101 190 185 325 240 5 6Vicat B C 94 94 97 61 63 53 49 108 75Hardness Shore D 73 63 59 57 83 79
