# Imaging display device.

## Abstract
An imaging display device characterized by comprising a pair of transparent substrates 6, 7 which are arranged in op position to each other with a predetermined interval therebe tween, photoelectric elements 2 11 which are disposed in a large number between the substrates and in adjacency to one of the substrates 6 and which convert light signals from out side the one substrate into electric signals, and a large number of electrooptic elements 3 24 which are disposed between the other substrate 7 and the respective photoelectric ele ments 2 11 and in a predetermined relationship of corre spondence with the photoelectric elements 2, 11 and which generate light signals by utilizing parts of the electric signals of 15 the corresponding photoelectric elements 2, 11 .
