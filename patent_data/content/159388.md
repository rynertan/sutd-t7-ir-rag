## Description
PREPARATION OF NUCLEAR CHLORINATED COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a vapor phase chloro denitration process for the preparation of nuclear chlorinated aromatic compounds including aromatic compounds bearing both chlorine and fluorine substituents on an aromatic ring and to novel compounds prepared thereby. The chloro and chloro fluoro aromatic compounds prepared by the process of this invention are especially useful as chemical intermediates for a variety of useful chemical products. The preparation of chlorobenzene compounds by chlorodenitration of the corresponding nitrobenzene compounds in the liquid phase is known. For example, the liquid phase chlorodenitration of 2 nitrobenzonitriles to form the corresponding 2 chlorobenzonitriles is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,225,534.Furthermore, it is known from the chemical literature that certain nitrobenzene or fluoronitrobenzene compounds may react with chlorine in the vapor phase with the replacement of nitro groups by chlorine atoms. Vorozhtsov et al, Zhurnal ObshcheiKhimii, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp. 1222 1226, April, 1961 . Such vapor phase reactions have been shown to be feasible only with certain unsubstituted nitrobenzenes or fluoronitrobenzenes.However, it has not heretofore been known or suggested that other substituted nitrobenzenes or substituted fluoronitrobenzenes might undergo chlorodenitration by vapor phase reaction with chlorine. Some of the dihalo and trihalo compounds that may be prepared by the process of this invention, including aromatic compounds having both chloro and fluoro substituents on the aromatic ring, have been prepared by various prior art methods.U.S. Patent 4,388,472 discloses the preparation of 3,4,5 trichlorobenzotrifluoride from 2,5 dichlorc 4 trifluoromethyl aniline by diazotization followed by reaction with cuprous chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. The 3,4,5 trichlorobenzotrifluoride product may then be reacted with KF to form 3 chloro 4,5 difluorobenzotrifluoride. U.S. Patent 4,259,510 discloses the preparation of trifluoromethylphenyl nitrophenylethers utilizing phenol reactants which may be prepared from substituted halobenzene reactants, including dihalobenzotrifluorides. U.S. Patent 4,012,453 discloses a catalyzed oxychlorofluorination reaction of toluene, benzotrichloride, hydrogen fluoride and oxygen wherein the product includes chlorofluorobenzotrifluoride as a component.The preparation of 4 chl oro 3 fl uorobenzotri fluoride by diazotiation of 3 amino 4 chl orobenzotri fluoride, isolating the diazonium salt as the fluoroborate then decomposing the salt is disclosed in European Patent 0 023 392 In addition, the incidental preparation of a chlorofluorobenzotrifluoride is described in Feast et al in J. Chem. Soc. c , 1971, 1547 49. The reference discloses 4 chloro 3 fluorobenzotrifluoride as a minor co product obtained during the synthesis of 3,4 difluorobenzotrifluoride from 3 amino 4 fluorobenzotrifl uoride. It has now been found that substituted chloro aromatic compounds of the general formula IEMI3.1 wherein m is 0, 1 or 2, n is 0, 1 or 2, q is 1 or 2, q m n is less than 6, R is CF3 OCF3, OC2F5, CN, NCO, or COCl, may be prepared by the vapor phase reaction of a chlorinating agent with a substituted nitroaromatic compound of the general formula IIEMI3.2 where m, n, q, and R are as defined above.In the general formulas I and II the indices g, m and n preferably have the following values q is 1, m is 2, and n is 0 q is 1, m is 2, and n is 1 q is 1, m is 2, and n is 2 q is 2, m is 0, and n is 0 q is 1, m is 1, and n is 0 q is 1, m is 0, and n is 1 q is 1, m is 1, and n is 1 q is 2, m is 0, and n is 0 q is 2, m is 0, and n is 1 q is 2, m is 0, and n is 2 q is 2, m is 1, and n is 0 q is 2, m is 1, and n is 1 q is 2, m is 1, and n is 2 9 is 2, m is 2, and n is 0 or q is 2, m is 2, and n is 1. The chloro denitration process of this invention is carried out under conditions of temperature and pressure appropriate for a vapor phase reaction, the exact conditions being dependent on the properties of the particular reactants employed. Typically, the process is carried out at atmospheric conditions and at a temperature in the range of about 2000 to about 4500 Celsius, or higher, preferably about 250 to 450 C and most preferably 290 to 410 C. The preferred chlorinating agent for economic considerations as well as efficiency of reaction, is chlorine.However, other chlorinating agents, including for example, hydrogen chloride gas, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, suirur cniorlae, phosgene, pnospnorus Iricnioriae, may De employed if desired. The proportions of reactants may vary widely with no critical limits. However, since chlorine is generally the less costly of the reactants, it is recommended to employ chlorine in excess of the amount necessary to react with the aromatic NO2 groups s . For example, a molar ratio of Cl2 N02 of about 1.1 1 to about 10 1, is preferred. The process of the invention is useful for the preparation of various specific unfluorinated or mono or di fluorinated, mono , di , and tri chloro substituted benzotrifluorides, benzoyl chlorides, phenyl isocyanates, and benzonitriles, trifluoromethoxy benzenes, and pentafluoroethoxybenzenes.

The process of the invention is particularly useful for the preparation of a wide variety of specific useful chemical intermediates in substantially pure form, heretofore unavailable to the chemical industry. The chloro fluoro aromatic compounds, prepared by the process of this invention are particularly useful for various organic syntheses based on nucleophilic substitution at the fluorine site. Thus, for example, the novel compound 5 chloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride may be reacted with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, to produce 4 chloro 2 trifluoromethylphenol. Similarly, 2 chl oro 4 trifl uoromethyl phenol, may be prepared by reaction of 3 chloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide.Because of the higher reactivity of the nuclear fluorine, the reaction can be run under mild conditions to afford a high yield of the desired product with little or no formation of undesired isomers. The resultant chloro trifluoromethylphenolate may be acidified to form the corresponding phenol compound. One method for the preparation of such compounds, as well as their use in the further preparation of various diphenyl ether herbicides is disclosed in detail in U.S.Patents 4,262,152 and 4,259,510. This novel compound 2 ,5 dichloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride may be reacted with hydroquinone, or a substituted phenol under basic conditions to form a phenyl ether of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,200,587 compound V, Col. 4 . As disclosed therein, such phenyl ethers may be further reacted with a suitable oxime to form useful herbicides. The novel compound 2 chloro 5 fluorobenzotrifluoride may be similarly reacted with potassium hydroxide to produce the 4 chloro 3 trifluoromethylphenolate which may then be acidified to form the corresponding phenol compound. Upon hydrogenolyis, the 4 chloro 3 trifluoromethylphenol may be converted to 3 trifluoro methylphenol. The use of this compound in the further preparation of pharmaceuticals is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patents 4,168,388 and 4,018,895. The chloro denitration process of this invention may, in some instances, be utilized with different reactants to produce the same end product. Thus, for example, the compound 3,4,5 trichlorobenzotrifluoride, a known and useful chemical intermediate may be prepared in accordance with this invention, by chloro denitration of 3,4 dichloro 5 nitrobenzotrifluoride. Alternatively, 3,4 ,5 tri chl orobenzotri fluoride may be prepared, in accordance with this invention, by chl orodeni trati on of 4 chloro 3,5 dinitrobenzotrifluoride. The latter compound, 4 chloro 3,5 dinitrobenzotrifluoride, is also a useful starting reactant for the preparation of a novel intermediate that may also be chloro denitrated in accordance with this invention.Thus, for example, 4 chloro 3,5 dinitrobenzotrifluoride may be reacted with an alkali metal fluoride to form a novel intermediate, 3,4 difluoro 5 nitrobenzotrifluoride, which may in turn, be converted, by chloro denitration in accordance with this invention, to 3 chloro 4,5 di fluorobenzotrifluoride, a known and useful compound. Moreover, the reactant 3,4 dichloro 5 nitrobenzotrifluoride is also useful as a starting reactant for the preparation of a novel intermediate that may be chloro denitrated in accordance with this invention. Thus, 3,4 dichloro 5 nitrobenzotrifluoride may be reacted with an alkali metal fluoride to form a novel intermediate, 3 chloro 4 fluoro 5 nitrobenzotrifluoride, which in turn, may be converted by chloro denitration, in accordance with this invention, to 3,5 dichloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride.
