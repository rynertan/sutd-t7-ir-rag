# UV LIGHT STABILIZED COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUBSTITUTED 1,5 DIAZACYCLOALKANES AND 2 KETO 1,5 DIAZACYCLOALKANES, NOVEL COMPOUNDS AND SYNTHESIS THEREOF

## Abstract
Novel polysubstituted 1,5 diazacycloalkanes and polysubstituted 2 keto 1,5 diazcycloalkanes are powerful stabilizers for materials subject to ultraviolet UV light degradation, particularly for polyolefins. The cyclic compounds of this invention have a a fixed three carbon bridge between the N¹ and N⁵ atoms of the diaza ring, the remaining portion of the ring having a variable length bridge of two or more carbon atoms, b an N adjacent carbon atom of the diaza ring is polysubstituted, that is, has two substituents which may be cyclizable. Compositions containing a the polysubstituted 1,5 diazacycloalkanes and polysubstituted 2 keto 1,5 diazacycloalkanes of this invention, and b prior art polysubstituted 1,5 diazacycloalkanes and polysubstituted 2 keto 1,5 diazacycloalkanes, exhibit excellent stability to UV light. A novel synthesis for preparing polysubstituted 2 keto 1,5 diazacycloalkanes is disclosed.
