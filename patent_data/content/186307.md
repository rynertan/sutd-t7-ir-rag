# Resin binder for toner composition.

## Abstract
A novel resin is produced by polymerizing a styrene and or a derivative thereof, b at least one monomer component selected from methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, a methacrylic ester and an acrylic ester, and c from 0.05 to 10 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers, of a polybasic acid having 7 to 40 carbon atoms, an anhydride thereof or a lower C1 to C6 alkyl ester thereof, the monomer component b containing at least one acrylic or methacrylic ester having hydroxyl or epoxy groups in at least equimolar amount to the component c . The resin preferably has a softening point of 100 to 160 C and a glass transition temperature of 50 C or higher. It is useful as a binder resin for a toner composition.
