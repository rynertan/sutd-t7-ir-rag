# DEVICE FOR APPLYING TRACTION TO PATIENTS

## Abstract
A lever 221 , pivotable on a pivot 251 has a traction applying cord 214 . The lever is acted on by a strut 260 in the form of a gas spring. An adjuster 223 can move strut 260 along the lever to change traction in the cord. An auxiliary cord 218 on the lever allows an operator to control the application of traction. A further cord 245 is provided for cervical traction. The device is mounted on a mobile frame 212 with a mast 213 and has reaction members 217, 216 allowing the device to be used with conventional beds. Attachment points 239 on the mast give choice of angle of traction. The mast has a pivoted beam 240 at the top for applying cervical traction to a patient sitting in a chair.
