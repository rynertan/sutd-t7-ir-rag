# Adjustable insert support.

## Abstract
An apparatus for supporting a cutting insert is disclosed. A rotatable head includes at least one peripheral slot which has a generally flat bottom and a pair of parallel sides. The parallel sides of the slot are tilted relative to the bottom so that the bottom of the slot forms an acute corner with one side and an obtuse corner with the other side. An insert seat is provided which has a bottom and a back side which meet at an acute angle conformed to the acute corner of the slot. The seat has a front side with a recess to support the cutting insert in a general radial posture relative to the rotatable head. The seat is secured to the slot with the back side of the seat flush with the side of the slot forming the acute corner. The location of the bottom of the seat relative to the bottom of the slot is adjustable. A wedge is forced between the insert and the side of the slot forming the obtuse corner to confine the insert between the wedge and the seat.
