# Adjustment means for injection timing of fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump having a mechanically adjustable servo valve for controlling the timing of the pumping event is disclosed. A pivoted lever 104 has one end F₁ which engages the spring seat 100 of a timing control plunger servo valve 86 which is also subjected to a speed related hydraulic signal 82,88,91,92,94 and another end F₁ in the form of a bimetal strip 102 which engages a cam 118 clamped on the throttle shaft 74 to pivot the lever 104 according to the rotational position of the shaft 74 . The profile of the cam 118 is such as to retard the timing of the pumping stroke when the charge delivered by the pump is increased to delay pressure built in the pump so that injection pressure in the associated nozzle is reached at a scheduled crankshaft angle regardless of variations in speed and load on the engine. A heater 113 for the bimetal strip 102 is provided to shift the servo spring seat 100 to change the timing of injection upon demand or automatically under a prescribed engine operation condition. In one embodiment, the bimetal provides 3 4 more advance when the engine is cold to compensate for the delayed ignition of the fuel.
