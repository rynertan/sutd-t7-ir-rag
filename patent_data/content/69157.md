## Description
ALTERNATING COPOLYESTERCARBONATE RESINS This invention relates to linear copolyesters that contain both carbonate groups and carboxylate groups in a linear chain. Polycarbonate resins are known to be tough and rigid and have moderately high softening temperatures. Of particular interest are the polycarbonates of bisphenol A diols as decribed in U.S. PatentNo. 3,028,365. On the other hand, polyesters such as those derived from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and or 1,4 butanediol are well known as molding resins having high softening temperatures but poor impact resistances. In the past, it has been a practice to make random linear copolymers containing ester and carbonate linkages in order to obtain polymers having heat distortion temperatures generally higher than those characteristic of polycarbonates. See, for example, U.S. PatentNos. 3,169,121 3,549,570 3,053,810 3,030,331 and 3,220,976. Unfortunately, however, the desired increase in heat distortion is often not as high as needed for many applications. More importantly, any increase in heat distortion is achieved only by sacrificing almost all of the high impact resistance that is characteristic of polycarbonate resins. In view of the aforementioned deficiencies of conventional polyeztrS, polycarbonate and copolymer.thereof, it would be highly desirable to provide a polymer of the same or similar monomeric materials wherein improved heat resistance is obtained without almost total sacrifice of impact resistance. The present invention is directed to a normally solid alternating copolyestercarbonate containing repeating units having the formula EMI2.1 wherein each R is independently aromatic hydrocarbylene or inertly substituted aromatic hydrocarbylene, Rt is phenylene or inertly substituted phenylene, and x is a number from 0.05 to 10 characterized in that R1 is meta phenylene or inertly substituted meta phenylene.For the purposes of this invention, an inertly substituted group is one having one or more substituents which are inert in the condensation reaction used to prepare the copolymer. Hydrocarbylene is a predominantly hydrocarbon divalent radical including aliphatic and or aromatic hydrocarbon diradicals as well as hydrocarbon radicals linked together by EMI3.1 This alternating copolymer is advantageously prepared by first reacting an excess of a dihydric hydrocarbylene with an isophthaloyl halide and then reacting the resulting dihydroxyester product with phosgene or a similar compound capable of forming carbonate linkages with diols. The first reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a hydrogen chloride acceptor such as pyridine.The second reaction is typically effected using conditions common to the reaction of phosgene with simple diols to form polycarbonates. This two step reaction to prepare the alternating copolymer can be represented by the following EMI3.2 wherein R, R1 and x are as defined hereinbefore. While the alternating copolymers of this invention are similar in many respects to their corresponding random copolymers, they exhibit heat resistance, clarity, solubility and strength that are unexpectedly higher than those of the random copolymers. Even more surprising is that such alternating polymers prepared from an isophthaloyl halide exhibit higher impact strengths and improved processability compared to similar alternating polymers prepared from terephthaloyl chloride. Accordingly, the alternating copolymers of this invention, particularly the resinous ones, are useful in most applications in which polycarbonates, polyesters and copolymers thereof are conventionally employed.In particular, such alternating copolymers are useful for making transparent tough films and molded hriflg h vs high heat resistance. In addition, such alternating copolymers may be blended with other polymers such as ABS resins, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers and impact polystyrenes to provide molding blends and or they may be combined with reinforcing fibers such as glass fibers. The dihydric hydrocarbylene employed in preparing the copolymers of this invention is suitably any predominantly hydrocarbon compound containing at least two alcoholic hydroxyl groups wherein alcoholic hydroxyl includes phenolic hydroxyl. Included within the dihydric hydrocarbylenes are aliphatic diols including glycols and cycloaliphatic diols, aromatic diols, including alkaryl diols, dihydric phenols and aromatic diols having heterocyclic groups such as phenolphthalein. Of the dihydric hydrocarbylenes, the dihydric phenols are preferred. The dihydric phenols preferably used in preparing the alternating copolymers of the present invention are suitably any aromatic compound having an aromatic hydrocarbylene group to which is aromatically bonded two hydroxyl groups. Most advantageously, the dihydric phenols are those aromatic diols represented by the formula EMI5.1 In the formula, A is an aromatic group such as, for example, phenylene, biphenylene, naphthenylene and anthracenylene.E is alkylene or alkylidene such as methylene, ethylene, ethylidene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, and isoamylidene or E may be cycloalkylene such as cyclopentylene or cyclohexylene a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone an ether linkage a carbonyl group a tertiary nitrogen group or a silicone containing linkage such as silane or siloxy. R is hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon group such as alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or cycloaliphatic Y is chlorine, bromine, fluorine or R wherein R is defined above.The letter m is any whole number from and including zero through the number of positions on A available for substitution p is any whole number from and including zero through the number of available positions on E t is a whole number equal to at least one s is either zero or one and u is any whole number including zero. Examples of such dihydric phenols include 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane and others including dihydroxy aromatic ethers listed in U.S. Patent No.3,169,121 at Column 2, line 60 through Column 3, line 55. Also included among the suitable dihydric phenols are those having an ar,ar dihydroxytrityl nucleus represented by the formula EMI6.1 wherein the aromatic rings bear, in addition to the hyflrox substituents, such substituents as, for example,H, F, C1, Br, I, NO2, 0 , alkyl, acyl, carboxylate ester or sulfonate ester. Representative diols containing the ar,ar dihydroxytrityl nucleus include phenolphthalein nucleus compounds as described in U.S.Patent No. 3,036,036 phenolsulfonephthalein nucleus compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,037 phthalidene nucleus compounds as described in U.S.Patent No. 3,036,038 fluorescein nucleus compounds as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,039 and phenolphthalimidene nucleus compounds corresponding to the phenolphthalein nucleus compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,036. Of the aforementioned dihydric phenols, the bis ar hydroxyphenyl alkylidenes, particularly bisphenol A, and phenolphthalein are preferred, with bisphenol A being most preferred. In the preparation of the alternating copolymers of this invention, any isophthaloyl halide is suitably employed. Most preferably, however, the isophthaloyl halide is isophthaloyl chloride, with isophthaloyl bromide and isophthaloyl iodide being suitable but less preferred than the chloride. Suitable alternatives to the isophthaloyl halide include inertly substituted derivatives of isophthaloyl halide wherein an inert substituent is, for example, halo, hydrocarbyl such as alkyl or aryl or halohydrocarbyl. The isophthaloyl halides are prepared by reacting the desired isophthalic acid with thionyl chloride or other thionyl halide in aromatic solvent, e.g., under conditions described inHigh Polymers, Vol. XXVII, Condensation Monomers, J. K. Stille and T. W. Campbell, editors, pages 509 514,Wiley Interscience, 1972.Exemplary diacids include isophthalic acid and halo derivatives thereof. The alternating copolymers are advantageously prepared by a two step process wherein an excess of the dihydric hydrocarbylene is first reacted with the isophthaloyl halide in the presence of a hydrogen chloride acceptor such as pyridine. The dihydroxyester intermediate produced by this reaction is then reacted with phosgene or other agent which will suitably form the desired carbonate linkages. Both steps of the process are normally carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen with the reactants dissolved in one or more solvent such that the reactants are totally miscible.While the concentrations of the reactants in the solvents are not particularly critical, the concentration of dihydric hydrocarbylene is preferably from 2 to 10 weight percent and the concentration of the isophthaloyl halide is preferably from 1 to 5 weight percent based on the total weight of monomers and solvents. In the second step of the reaction, the concentration of ester intermediate is preferably from 3 to 15 weight percent based on total weight of ester intermediate and solvents. It is preferred that the solutions of the various reactants be totally miscible in each other. It is sufficient, however, if such solutions are partially miscible, i.e., at least 10 weight percent.Examples of suitable solvents include chlorinated aiiphatic hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, sym tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2trichloroethane and cis 1,2 dichloroethylene. The molar ratio of dihydric hydrocarbylene to isophthaloyl halide varies proportionately with the ester carbonate ratio desired in the alternating copoly mer. Generally, the molar ratio of dihydric hydrocarbylene to isophthaloyl halide is advantageously from 21 1 to 1.1 1, preferably from 21 1 to 1.3 1. The molar ratio of dihydroxyester intermediate to phosgene is advantageously from 1 1 to 1 1.2, preferably 1 1.01 to 1 1.08. While pyridine is the preferred hydrogen chloride acceptor employed in the first step of this process, other suitable acceptors include other amine bases such as triethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline and N,N dimethylcyclohexylamine. Such acceptors are advantageously employed in amounts sufficient to complex the hydrogen chloride liberated and to catalyze both steps of the process. Since higher concentrations of the acceptor produce higher molecular weight copolymers, actual concentrations of acceptor will vary depending upon the molecular weight desired. Moreover, at constant terminator levels, higher monomer concentrations produce higher molecular weight copolymers. Therefore, the concentrations of monomers vary depending upon the molecular weight desired. Preferably, in order to prepare copolymers having weight average molecular weights Mw from 25,000 to 60,000, the acceptor is employed in amounts from 100 to 160 mole percent based on moles of hydroxyl moiety in the monomers, most preferably from 120 to 140 mole percent. At such acceptor concentrations, the concentrations of monomers are preferably im the range from 3 to 15 weight percent, most preferably from 5 to 12 weight percent. In carrying out the two step process, the dihydric hydrocarbylene and isophthaloyl halide are combined in any manner, preferably by adding the isophthaloyl halide either neat or dissolved in a suitable solvent with stirring to a solution of the dihydric hydrocarbylene and hydrogen chloride acceptor. While stirring rateis not critical , a stirring rate of 50 to 500 rpm, most preferably from 150 to 300 rpm, is maintained. While reaction temperature is not critical, the reaction temperature of the first step is preferably maintained in the range from 10 to 350C, most preferably from 190to 250C. Reaction pressures are similarly not critical, however, atmospheric to superatmospheric pressures are normally employed as a matter of convenience.The ester intermediate is normally formed under these conditions in 1 to 10 minutes after addition of the isophthaloyl halide. While the ester intermediate may be recovered and purified before proceeding to the second step of the process, it is generally not desirable to do so. Accordingly, the aforementioned reaction mixture containing the ester intermediate is converted to the desired copolymer by bubbling phosgene or other suitable carbonate forming reactant into the reaction mixture. Advantageously, the reaction mixture contains an amount of a monohydric phenol or other suitable chain terminator to effect desired control of the molecular weight of the resulting copolymer. While the amount of chain terminator employed varies with the efficacy of the terminator and the molecular weight desired, beneficial amounts of terminator are normally in the range from 1 to 10 mole percent based on ester intermediate, preferably from 2 to 7 mole percent.Although not critical, the reaction temperature of the second step is preferably maintained in the range from lOC to 35 C, most preferably from 20 to 270C. As in the first step, reaction pressures are normally dultUS pheric to superatmospheric as a matter of convenience.The alternating copolymer is normally formed under these conditions in 1 to 10 minutes after phosgene addition. In both steps of the foregoing process, the reaction mixture is agitated sufficiently to effect intimate contact of the reactants and desired heat transfer throughout the reaction medium. Following completion of the second step of the process, the desired alternating copolymer is readily recovered from the reaction medium by conventional techniques as exemplified in the following examples. Due to the ease of preparation and less expensive starting materials, the alternating copolymers derived from bisphenol A and isophthaloyl chloride are preferred. The alternating copolymers of this invention are more advantageously represented by the formula EMI10.1 wherein Y and Z are independently terminating groups common to polyesters or polycarbonates R, R1, and x are as defined hereinbefore and n is a whole number from 5 to 300. Illustratively, Y is EMI11.1 wherein R2 is hydrocarbyl such as alkyl, aryl or aralkyl and R and R1 are as defined hereinbefore. Representative Z includes R2 and HORwherein R2 and R are as defined hereinbefore. The alternating copolymers having repeating units are most advantageously represented by the formula EMI11.2 wherein Y is OH orEMI11.3 Z is R2 or ROH x is 0.05 to 10, preferably 0.05 to 3 and R, R1, R2 and n are as defined hereinbefore.Preferred alternating copolymers are those represented by the foregoing formula wherein Y isEMI11.4 Z is R2 R2 is hydrocarbyl, e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, cycloalkyl or aralkyl and n is a whole number from 5 to 300, preferably from 10 to 200 and most preferably from 30 to 100. For purposes of this invention, hydrocarbyl is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical. In the most preferred alternating copolymers Y isEMI12.1 Z is R2 R2 isEMI12.2 R isEMI12.3 While the molecular weight of the alternating copolymers of this invention is not particularly critical, those having weight average molecular weight Mw, determined by gel permeation chromatography using a bisphenol A polycarbonate calibration curve greater than 20,000 are of more significance.It is found that those copolymers of relatively high molecular weight, e.g., those having a Mw of at least 25,000 up to and including those having a Mw of 60,000, are found to exhibit the properties and physical characteristics most desirable of molding resins. Most preferred for this purpose are those copolymers having a Mw in the range from 25,000 to 40,000 and Mw Mn Mn is number average molecular weight from 1.5 to 5. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention and should not be construed as limiting its scope. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. Examle l and Comnarative Run A Preparation of the Alternating Copolymers In step one of a two step process, a 12 l liter flask was charged with 751.0 g 3.29 mol of bisphenol A, 7.938 1 methylene chloride and 676.6 g 8.554 mol pyridine. Stirring was begun and when a clear solution of bisphenol A was obtained, 333.93 g 1.645 mol isophthaloyl chloride was added continuously over a period of 7 minutes while continuously stirring the contents of the flask at a temperature between 190and 250C and 250 rpm. The clear reaction solution was stirred an additional 10 minutes following isophthaloyl chloride addition before the second step of the process was begun. In step two, the aforementioned reaction solution containing the ester intermediate was combined with 12.35 g 0.082 mol p tert butylphenol as chain terminator. The resulting solution was stirred at 175 rpm and 175.7 g 1.584 mol phosgene was added over a period of 56 minutes by bubbling the phosgene into the liquid reaction solution at a temperature between 220and 250C. The resulting polymeric product was recovered from the reaction mixture by the following procedure 1.5 1 of 3.0 N HC1 was added to neutralize excess pyridine. Following phase separation, the methylene chloride solution of polymer was washed consecutively with 1 1 of 0.5 N HC1 and 1 1 of water, with phase separation after each washing. Following the final washing, the methylene chloride solution of polymer 5 paDSed through a column packed with a cation exchange resin sulfonic acid type, bed volume of 500 600 ml , giving a clear, almost water white solution. The polymeric product was isolated by the slow addition of 1 volume of methylene chloride solution to 5 volumes of hexane with rapid stirring.The resulting white fibers were isolated by filtration, dried in air for 24 hours and then dried in vacuo 48 hours at 1200C to yield 900.1 g 89.3 percent of theory having an inherent viscosity of about 0.51 dl g measured in methylene chloride at 250C, 0.5 g dl .

The recovered random copolymer had an inherent viscosity of about 0.51 dl g measured in CH2C12 at 250C, 0.5 g dl . Compression molded test bars thickness of 3.2 mm, molded at 300 C of this copolymer Sample No. A were also tested for physical properties and the results are reported in Table I.
