# Improvements in and relating to noise blanking circuitry in a radio receiver.

## Abstract
A radio receiver 10 including an RF amplifier stage 12 arranged to receive transmitted RF signals and noise signals from an antenna 11 , a mixer strage 13 for converting the RF signals to intermediate frequency signals and supplying the IF signals to a blanker gate 15 receiving blanking signals from a blanking signal source 25, 26 , the gate 15 normally passing IF signals to discriminator means 19 to demodulate the IF signals to audio signals the blanking signals when present decoupling the mixer stage 13 from the demodulator 19 . The audio signal output from the discriminator 19 is applied to a noise squelch circuit 27, 29 to 32 which detects noise frequencies above a predetermined frequency. If the predetermined frequency is exceeded, a squelch signal is generated to block or mute the audio signals. The squelch circuit employs an averaging detector 27 in order to eliminate short duration spikes in the squelch circuit. The blanking signal generator circuit 25, 26 employs a tracking pulse detector 25 which is immune to false triggering by maintaining the detector threshold.
