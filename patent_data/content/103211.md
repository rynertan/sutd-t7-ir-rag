## Description
Background of the Invention This invention relates to fluorinated compositions which impart oil and water repellency to synthetic fibers, particularly polyester and nylon fibers, and thus function as anti soil agents. In particular, this invention relates to fluorinated compositions derived from fluorinated acrylates and aromatic amines. Description of the Prior Art Compounds containing fluorinated groups are broadly known for use as anti soil agents for synthetic fibers. Fluorinated polyacrylates are disclosed in U,S. 3,171,861,U.S. 3,547,861 and U.S. 3,818,074. These compositions are generally not suitable for application to fibers prior to manufacture of textile fabric or prior to the dyeing of such fabric. In U.S. 3,646,153 fluorinated compositions which are compatible with the fiber forming polymer are disclosed but these tend to be removed from the fiber upon laundering. Fluorinated carbamates, derived from the reaction of perfluoroalkanols with isocyanates, are disclosed in U.S.3,657,320. Typical of these is the compound having the formulaEMI1.1 which is shown in Example 10 of said patent. Fluorinated carbamates are also disclosed in J54 133,485. Specifically, a water soluble dispersion of the compoundsEMI1.2 is shown in Example 9 of said application. Polyfluorinated derivatives of amines and amine salts are disclosed in U.S. 3,719,698. Exemplified are compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 which are depicted in columns 1 and 3 of said patent respectively. In U.S. 3,870,748 compositions derived from polyfluorinated epoxides and carboxylic acids or amines are disclosed The compound having the formulaEMI2.2 is illustrated in column 9 of said patent. Summary of the invention Applicants have discovered a novel group offluorinated compositions derived from fluorinated acrylates and aromatic amines which have excellent anti soiling properties, durability and resistance to laundering when incorporated in polyester and nylon fibers. The compounds of the present invention may be depicted.by the formulaEMI2.3 wherein n is 1 to 3 and m is 0 to 4 Ar is an aromatic radical containing from 1 3 benzene rings which may be fused together or linked through a single carbon carbon bond or a linking group selected from 0 , S , SO2 , NH , NHCO , CH2N R2 CH2 , CO , CaH2a, CH , CO2CbH2bO2C , and CbH2b 1 O2C 3 wherein a is 1 to 6, b is 2 to 6, and R2 is H, lower alkyl or phenyl, R is independently selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, amino, lower alkylamino, lower acylamino, C02R3 and NHCH2CH R1 CO2R3 wherein R3 is lower alkyl, CH2CH2OH, or CH2CH OH CH2Cl R1 is H or CH3 and Rf is a fluorinated radical of the formula W CdF2d Y where in W has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and is selected from alkylene and W Z W e where W and W are alkylene, z its 0, S, NHCO, or NHSO2, and e is O or 1, Y is hydrogen, fluoro, or perfluoroalkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and d is 2 to 20. Compounds found to be particularly advantageous are those wherein Ar contains 2 or 3 benzene rings and n is 2 or 3. In the above formulation it is intended that the fluorinated radical Rf may be straight, branched or cyclic in any of its alkylene or perfluoroalkylene chains.The term lower, such as in lower alkyl, is intended to embrace moieties of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The subject compounds have an excellent affinity for polyester and nylon fibers and may be incorporated with the raw or partially finished fiber by several methods. In one method the additive may be melt blended with the resin then extruded to form a fiber. In a second method the fiber may be treated with a solution, dispersion or emulsion of the additive in liquid medium, typically a solution in organic solvent or an aqueous emulsion. Either method is generally followed by subsequent heat treatment or annealing of the fiber. The present compounds are sufficiently compatible with the resin that they become an integral part of the fiber, yet the incompatibility imparted by the fluorinated groups, and the mobility of the compounds, is sufficient to concentrate the compounds at the surface of the fiber, making the fiber hydrophobic and oleophobic. Once incorporated into the fiber surface, the present compounds resist being abraded or washed away because of their affinity for the resin and because of the low solubility of the compounds in aqueous soap solutions and dry cleaning solvents.The present compounds also allow satisfactory dye ing of the treated fiber, or may be applied together with a dyestuff from the same bath The present invention also includes polyester and nylon fibers, especially those derived from polyethylene terephthalate PET and nylon 6 and nylon 66, which have incorporated therewith at least one compound as defined above, and a process for producing such fibers which comprises contacting the fiber with a liquid emulsion, dispersion or solution containing at least one.compound as defined above, and thereafter heat treating or annealing the fiber to impart oil and water repellency.
