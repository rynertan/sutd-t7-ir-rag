# Flight simulator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a flight simulator comprising at least one element whose position is variable during the flight, such as a control member e.g. a control column, an associated, programmable servo means coup led with the or each element, said means comprising an amplifier, a servo motor coupled with the output thereof, a force to electric signal converter arranged between said servo motor and said element and having its output coupled with a first input of said amplifier, a position to electric signal converter arranged on said element and having its output coupled with a second input of said amplifier and a computer calculating a force associated with the condition of said element on the basis of the flight conditions and the relevant proper ties of the or each element and applying a corresponding signal to the amplifier. The flight simulator according to the invention pro vides a perfectly faithful simulation of all practical sys tems without imposing limitations to the order of the sys tem to be simulated. Thereto the simulator according to the invention is characterized in that the computer is coupled with the amplifier through an electric analogon representing the mechanical properties of the element concerned.
