# Method for manufacturing a pipe part from fibre reinforced thermosetting synthetic material and mandrel for manufacturing such a pipe part.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of a pipe part from fibre reinforced thermosetting resin, such as a T piece, preformed pipe parts 29, 32 30, 31, 32 made of fibre reinforced thermosetting resin are placed on a mandrel 1 defining the inside shape of the pipe part, the external surface of the mandrel 1 being partially covered. The space between the mandrel 1 and the inside of the pre formed pipe parts 29, 32 30, 31, 32 is sealed and the parts 39, 42 40, 41, 42 of the pre formed pipe parts 29, 32 30, 31, 32 adjacent to the uncovered part 38 of the mandrel 1 are chamfered on the outside. Synthetic resin impregnated fibres are then applied to the uncovered part 38 of the mandrel 1 and to at least the chamfered parts 39, 42 40, 41, 42 of the preformed pipe parts 29, 32 30, 31, 32 placed on the mandrel 1 , until the pipe part has reached the desired final shape, after which it is cured and the mandrel 1 is removed from the finished pipe part.
