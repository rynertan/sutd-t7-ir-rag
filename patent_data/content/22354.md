## Description
Signal Processing Apparatus for Image Scanners This invention relates to image scanners and, in particular, to signal processing apparatus for use therewith. In mechanical optical image scanners, a detector array of one or more detector elements, usually photoconductive detectors, is scanned by an image of a scene to be viewed and produces an electrical signal which is processed and fed to a display device to enable the image to be viewed. Generally, the signal processing equipment includes sampling means for sampling the signal at a sampling frequency higher than the frequency range of interest, means for amplifying, shaping, storing and otherwise further processing the sampled signal as required, and means for reconstituting the further processed signal ready for supply to the display device. The characteristics of the detectors, and likewise the signal processing techniques employed, tend to cause roll off at the higher frequencies. Although noise generated by the detectors and preamplifiers also tends to roll off, this noise roll off is not as fast as the fall off in signal response. In addition, noise present in the signal being sampled at a frequency above one half the sampling frequency tends to beat down with the sampling frequency to noise of a lower frequency in the range of interest, thereby worsening the signal to noise ratio. On the other hand, at frequencies below half the sampling frequency, there is a clear benefit to be obtained by boosting higher frequencies within the range of interest, since these frequencies determine the sharpness and detail of the viewed image. It would therefore besadvantageous to provide signal processing equipment which can boost higher frequencies in the range of interest while excluding noise of a frequency above one half the sampling frequency. However, in providing such a boost to the higher frequencies in the range of interest, it is necessary to avoid unwanted disturbance of the relative phases of the components of the original signal, since the effect of a boost producing unwanted phase shifts would be to increase the noise level at a faster rate than the resolution of the image is improved. The present invention has for an object to provide a solution to this problem. Accordingly, signal processing apparatus for an image scanner and according to one aspect of the invention comprises one or more detector elements scanned by an image of a scene to be viewed and producing an electrical signal representative of said image, sampling means operative at a predetermined sampling frequency F for sampling said electrical signal to enable further processing thereof, means for reconstituting the sampled and further processed signal and a display device for receiving the reconstituted signal to enable said image to be viewed, wherein a transversal filter is located in the or each detector channel ahead of the sampling means, said filter being constructed with respect to the sampling frequency to boost with minimum undesired phase shifts frequencies in a range having an upper limit adjacent B 2 and substantially to reject frequencies in a range having a lower limit adjacent B 2. Another problem which arises with signal processing equipment of the kind in question is that residual phase errors may exist in the signal even when the processing methods employed are designed to minimise introduction of phase shifts In particular, phase errors arise due to the transit time of the charge carriers in a photoconductive detector With the arrangement in accordance with the invention, the transversal filter may depart from a symmetrical construction to an extent sufficient to correct residual phase errors in the signal being processed at frequencies in said range having an upper limit adjacent B 2 However, the invention is also applicable to the case where correction for phase errors is desirable, whether or not a frequency selective signal boost is also required. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, signal processing apparatus for an image scanner comprises one or more detector elements scanned by an image of a scene to be viewed and producing an electrical signal representative of said image, sampling means operative at a predetermined sampling frequency F for sampling said electrical signal to enable further processing thereof, means for reconstituting the sampled and further processed signal and a display device for receiving the reconstituted signal to enable said image to be viewed, wherein the or each detector element is a photoconductive detector, and one or more transversal filters are located in the signal path between the one or more photoconductive detectors and the display device, said filter being asymmetrically constructed substantially to correct phase errors in the signal being processed, including phase errors due to the transit time of the charge carriers in the one or more photoconductive detectors. A practical arrangement of signal processing apparatus in accordance with the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a chain of signal processing apparatus, Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a symmetrical transversal filter, Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of an asymmetrical transversal filter, and Figure 4 is the frequency response curve for the filter of Figure 2 The apparatus shown in Figure 1 comprises an array 10 of detector elements signal processing equipment 11 constituted by a sampling means 12, further processing means 13 such as amplifying means, shaping means, signal storage means and in general means for effecting any such further process functions on the signal as may be required, and signal reconstituting means 14 and a display device 15.For convenience and clarity the detector array 10 and the display device 15 are considered part of the signal processing chain, although they do not actually perform any signal processing function in themselves. The sampling means 12, which is of a kind conventional in such processing equipment, operates at a predetermined sampling frequency F above the range of frequencies of interest. In order to provide a phaseless boost to higher frequencies in the range of interest below F 2, without creating aliasing problems due to heterodyning of noise at still higher frequencies above R 2, a transversal filter 16 is provided in each detector channel between the detector array 10 and the processing equipment 11, In the drawing, the filters 16 for the first and nth detector channels are indicated. It is possible to construct a symmetrical transversal filter with a substantially constant group delay negative phase free frequency response function R f of the general form R f a b cos 21t f u c cos 411 f d cos 6 Th f T where a, b, c .... are tapping ratio coefficients of the filter and T is the delay parameter of the filter stages. One simple transversal filter 16 having such a frequency response function is shown in Figure 2, wherein 17 designates the input and 18 designates the output, A indicates a differential amplifier, delay stages are marked T and resistors are designated R. It is to be noted that the filter 16 in Figure 2 is of symmetrical form, with balanced resistors R2 of equal value and balanced resistors R3 of equal value. Accordingly, this filter has a response function of the form R f a b cos 21f f s d cos 6fr f T This response function is illustrated in Figure 4. The delay parameter r is selected such that the half sampling frequency B 2 approximately coincides with the point marked 19 on the response curve, in order that high frequency noise is rejected, at least in a frequency range having a lower limit adjacent v 2 A back up filter not shown is provided to reject still higher frequencies above about 1r times the Nyquist rate, where the response curve rapidly rises again.The phase characteristic of this backup filter is relatively unimportant, as its operational frequency range is much higher than the frequency range of interest The boost given to higher frequencies within the range of interest, in particular in a range having an upper limit adjacent w 2, is apparent from the shape of the response curve, The transversal filter 16 shown in Figure 2 with the response curve of Figure 4 is of a relatively simple form a filter with a larger number of delay stages can be constructed with a performance which conforms more closely to an ideal response curve.In particular, a transversal filter constructed with a response function including the c cos 4tr f T term would minimise the ripple about R O in the response curve of Figure 4. The filter 16 of Figure 2 is a matched phase transversal filter which boosts the signal in the desired range below F 2 without introducing any phase shifts. However, phase errors exist in the signal due to other factors, including in particular phase errors due to the transit time of the charge carriers in detectors which are of the photoconductive type.The filter of Figure 2 may be modified, to assume the form of the asymmetrical filter 20 indicated inFigure 3, in order to provide for correction of these residual phase errors. In the asymmetrical transversal filter ofFigure 3, the resistors R2 and R21, and possibly also the resistors R3 and R3 , are made unequal. Thus, assumingR2 R2 , the filter of Figure 3 has a frequency response function R f as follows R f a b1 cos 2ft f b2 sin 2 f d cos 6 f where b a R1 R1 R2 R2 R2 and b2 a R1 , . The modulus of the response I f is given by R f a d cos 6 f b1 cos 2 f ê b22 sin2 2 f and the phase shift is given by b2 sin 2 f tan 1 a d cos 6 f b1 cos 2 f Thus, the coefficients a, bl, b2, d can be selected to assist the desired correction of residual phase errors, whilst at the same time the boosting of frequencies below F 2 and the rejection of frequencies in a range higher than F 2 is maintained. For the correction of such residual phase errors, the filter of Figure 3 will have the minimum necessary departure from symmetry, so that the coefficient b2 will generally be small in value.The same general consideration applies if, in addition, R3 R3 , when the phase shift e is given by tan 1 When an asymmetric transverse filter with a large number of delay stages is constructed, with a frequency response R f of the general form R f a b1 cos 2ftt f b2 sin 2 f c1 cos 4 f c2 sin 2 f more diverse phase error corrections are possible, in accordance with the increased number of coefficients, which represent tapping ratios in the transversal filter, available for adjustment.In this connection, it is to be noted that these coefficients may be given values corresponding to negative resistor values, since in physical reality this simply means the construction of a filter in which the corresponding resistors are connected to the negative input instead of the positive input of the differential amplifier A. It will also be apparent from the above description referring to Figure 3 that the use of an asymmetric transversal filter is applicable to the case when correction of phase errors is desirable whether or not a selective frequency boost is required at the same time In this case, it may be unnecessary to minimise the departures of the filter from a symmetrical arrangement, depending on the magnitude of the phase errors to be corrected. Thus, in practice, the phase shifts arising due to all factors, including phase shifts due to the transit time of the charge carriers in the photoconductive detectors, will be observed, and the tapping ratios in the transversal filter which determine the magnitudes of the coefficients a, b, c .... in the above equations, will be chosen so that the phase term e as a function of frequency acts to compensate these observed phase shifts Finally, the invention as above described is also applicable to a scanner wherein a single detector element is employed.
