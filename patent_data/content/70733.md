# Overhead electric transmission systems.

## Abstract
In an overhead electric transmission system in which an overhead conductor includes at least one optical fibre constituting part of an optical communication system, there is provided, at a tower along the system, an electrically conductive rod 14 supported by and electrically insulated by an insulator 15 from the crossarm 11 of the tower but electrically connected to earth through the primary winding 16 of a step down voltage transformer. The rod is substan tially horizontal and substantially parallel to a group 13 of overhead electric conductors suspended from the cross arm 11 by an insulator 12. The surface area of the metal rod 14 and its position with respect to the group 13 of current carrying conductors of the system are such that electrical power for regenerators or other ancillary equipment of the optical communication system is provided across the se condary winding of the transformer, thereby affording sim ple and inexpensive means of providing such power.
