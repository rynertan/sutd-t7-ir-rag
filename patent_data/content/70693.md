# A control system for a synchronous motor employed as a servomotor.

## Abstract
A control system for a synchronous motor which is em ployed as a servo motor, wherein a pulse coder 1 is employ ed for detection of the absolute position of one of the field po les of the motor, the absolute position being a component of the input signals for generating a poly phase alternating cur rent voltage which generates a rotating field maintaining a fi xed amount of phase difference with respect to the absolute position of one of the field poles of the motor, whereby the synchronous motor is controlled to run maintaining a fixed amount of internal phase angle of e.g. Ï€ for the entire opera tion period. An improvement is provided in that the pulse coder has two pulse coder elements 3, 4 one 3 of which is respon sible to detect the absolute position of one of the field poles of the motor and the other 4 of which is responsible to generate incremental pulses during each interval of the signals repre senting the absolute position of one of the field poles, whereby a larger amount of resolving power is realized for the pulse co der, ultimately improving the performance of the control sy stem.
