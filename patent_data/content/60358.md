# Head support arm and head arm assemblies for disk files.

## Abstract
A cantilever head support arm for a disk file comprises a flat beam structure 10 and a means of damping the structure against out of plane vibrations. The damping means comprises a rigid side bar 14 extending along one longitudinal edge of the beam structure and a layer 16 of compliant damping material connecting the beam structure 10 and side bar together. Relative motion between the beam structure and side bar causes elastic shear deforma tion of the damping layer 16 to absorb the energy of vibra tion.
