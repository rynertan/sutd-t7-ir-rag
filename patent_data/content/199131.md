## Description
SURFACTANTS DERIVED FROM CITRIC ACID The present invention relates to non toxic and biodegradable surfactants derived from citric acid. in the large number of classes of known surfactants there is hardly a simple product possessing a combination of valuable properties such as biodegradability, non toxicity, lack of skin irritating properties, high solubility in water, together with excellent detergent properties, that would make such a product particularly versatile and, therefore, utilizable, in the same way, in the most different fields of use such as, for instance, in the field of detergents in general, in the field of toiletry, for beauty care, in the food and textile industry, in emulsion polymerization etc. It has now been found that surfactants derived from citric acid, more particularly, surfactants consisting of esters of citric acid with aliphatic polyoxyalkylated alcohols, as well as of the salts thereof with inorganic or organic bases, show the abovementioned characteristics in combination and, therefore, are useful in a wide field of application. In accordance with the present invention, there are provided esters of citric acid having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R, Rl, R2 are equal or different from each other and represent a hydrogen atom, an alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium cation, a cation of an organic ammonium base or a group having the formula An R3 II wherein A is a C2 Ce oxyalkylene group, n is a number ranging between 1 and 20 and R3 is a C8 C20 alkyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R, R1, R2 is an An R3 group, and wherein the OH group of the ester of formula I can be esterified or etherified according to usual methods. The alkaline metal is preferably selected from sodium and potassium and the alkaline earth metal is preferably magnesium. The cation of an organic ammonium base may, for instance, be derived from an alkanolamine such as triethanolamine. R3 is preferably selected from linear or branched alkyl groups containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms. The oxyalkylene group A is preferably an oxyethylene group CH2 CH2O and n preferably ranges from 4 to 8. The esters of formula I may be prepared by a process which comprises esterification of citric acid with an aliphatic polyoxyalkylated alcohol having the formula R3 An OH III wherein R3, A and n are defined as above, by heating at a temperature of from 150 to 1900C, with continuous distillation of the water formed during the reaction and, optionally, converting the obtained product into a salt by means of an alkaline, alkaline earth metal or ammonium base or an amine. In the above mentioned process, mono , di and tri esters are obtained having the following formulae, respectively EMI2.1 Depending on reaction conditions employed and, in particular, on the molar ratios of citric acid to polyoxyalkylated alcohol, either monodi or triesters are preferably formed. In order to preferentially produce the monoester of formula IV , citric acid and poiyoxyal kylated alcohol are reacted in substantially equimolar ratio, whereas they are reacted in a molar ratio of about 1 2 in order to produce the diester of formula V . Higher molar ratios lead to the formation of substantial amounts of the triester of formula VI . In the case of the preparation of the diesrer by using a polyoxyethylated alcohol, the reaction may be represented by the following reaction scheme EMI2.2 The polyoxyalkylated alcohols of formula III are known products and are commercially available.The ethoxylated alcohols may, for instance, be prepared by reacting the alcohol with ethylene oxide, using an alkaline base as a catalyst. Preferred among the ethoxylated alcohols are those having the formula R3 OCH2CH2 n OH wherein R3 is a linear or branched alkyl group containing 12 to 16 carbon atoms and n ranges between 4 and 8, as well as the mixtures thereof. The esters according to the present invention and, in particular, the monoesters and diesters of ethoxylated alcohols, their salts or mixtures thereof are very efficient surfactants, which allow a con siderable reduction of the surface tension even when used in a very low concentration and, therefore, may be used as emulsifying agents, dispersants and as detergents in general. Besides the excellent detergent properties, they do not exhibit any toxic or skin or eye irritation effect and they do not have any acute toxicity, if ingested orally. They are highly biodegradable, the biodegradability being over 90 . They are stable within a wide temperature range up to 100 C and after storage for a long time at low temperatures, they do not give rise to any separation when brought to room temperature. They show a good, but not an excessive wetting power and a good foamability. Their solubility in water ranges from moderate to excellent. In particular, their solubility increases with the increase of the number of moles of ethylene oxide contained in the alkylether chain.For instance, when the number of moles of ethylene oxide equals 3, the ester is not very soluble, whereas when the number of moles of ethylene oxide equals 7, the ester has good solubility. The esters according to the invention are compatible with most known surfactants and, therefore, may be formulated with them. Because of their overall characteristics the esters according to the invention are very flexible in the different fields of application for surface active agents. Owing to their high detergent power, combined with the lack of detrimental effects on the skin, the hair, the eyes, they are particularly suitable for beauty care applications, for instance, for the preparation of liquid or creamy detergents for the skin, shampoos and bath foams. The following examples will illustrate the invention, without limiting, however, its scope.EXAMPLE 1Esterification of citric acid 173.88 g 0.9 moles of citric acid and 913.54 g 1.809 moles of LIAL 123 commat .7 ETO a mixture of ethoxylated alcohols having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R3 C11, C12, C,3 and n 7 with an average molecular weight of 505 were introduced, under nitrogen, into a reactor equipped with a heating system, stirrer, thermometer and a system for feeding the reactants and connected with a cooler provided with a manifold for collecting the reaction water.
