## Description
PROCESS AND PRODUCTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the field of electrochemistry there is a well known electrochemical cell known as a chlor alkali cell. In this cell, an electric current is passed through a saturated brine sodium chloride salt solution to produce chlorine gas and caustic soda sodium hydroxide . A large portion of the chlorine and caustic soda for the chemical and plastics industries are produced in chloralkali cells. Such cells are divided by a separator into anode and cathode compartments. The separator characteristically can be a substantially hydraulically impermeable membrane, e.g., a hydraulically impermeable cation exchange membrane, such as the commercially available NATION manufactured by the E. I. du Pont de Nemours be Company. Alternatively, the separator can be a porous diaphragm, e.g., asbestos, which can be in the form of vacuum deposited fibers or asbestos paper sheet as are well known in the art The anode can be a valve metal, e.g., titanium, provided with a noble metal coating to yield what is known in the art as a dimensionally stable anode. One of the unwanted byproducts present in a chlor alkali cell is hydrogen which forms at the cell cathode. This hydrogen increases the power requirement for the overall electrochemical process, and eliminating its formation is one of the desired results in chlor alkali cell operation. It has been estimated that 25 percent of the electrical energy required to operate a chlor alkali cell is utilized due to the formation of hydrogen at the cathode. Hence, the prevention of hydrogen formation, e.g., by reacting water with oxygen at the cathode resulting in the formation of hydroxide, can lead to substantial savings in the cost of electricity required to operate the cell. In fairly recent attempts to achieve cost savings and energy savings in respect of operating chlor alkali cells, attention has been directed to various forms of what are known as oxygen air cathodes. These cathodes prevent the formation of molecular hydrogen at the cathode and instead reduce oxygen to form hydroxyl ions. Savings in cost for electrical energy are thereby achieved. One known form of oxygen air cathode involves use of an active layer containing porous active carbon particles whose activity in promoting the formation of hydroxide may or may not be catalyzed enhanced using precious metal catalysts, such as silver, platinum, etc. Unfortunately, however, the pores of such active carbon particles may become flooded with the caustic soda thereby significantly reducing their ability to catalyze the reduction of oxygen at the air cathode and resulting in decreased operating efficiency.In an attempt to overcome these difficulties in flooding of the active carbon, hydrophobic materials, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE , have been employed in particulate or fibrillated greatly attenuated and elongated form to impart hydrophobicity to the active carbon layer, per se, andlor to a protective wetproofing or backing sheet which can be laminated or otherwise attached to the active layer. Thus, PTFE has been employed in both active layers and in backing wetproofing layers secured thereto. Such active carbon containing layers, however, are subjected to loss of strength resulting in failure combined with blistering thereof when the chlor alkali cell is operated at high current densities, viz., current densities of about 250 milliamperes cm2 and higher for prolonged time periods. In the fuel cell art, the cathode of fuel cells can be made of conducting particles, e.g., conducting particles of carbon, for example, active Ãª carbon, viz., carbon having a B.E.T. surface area greater than 600 m g. Catalyzed active carbon is a suitable catalyst for the reduction of oxygen to hydroxide at the cathode. In such cathode active layers, which contain the active carbon catalyst particles, there is encountered a situation whereby the caustic soda NaOH wets the catalyst surface and in essence blocks the pores from contacting the reactants and thereby functioning as a catalyst. Additionally, the active carbon particles are corroded when in use, and this corrosion reduces their catalytic efficiency and also their surface area. Various techniques have been developed in the art to reduce the wettability of the active carbon catalyst particles. One of these techniques involves mixing or otherwise incorporating polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE particles with the active carbon particles to impart hydrophobicity to the active carbon layer and lessen or inhibit its disposition to be wetted by the alkali present in the chlor alkali cell. Since the PTFE particles are less electrically conductive than the active carbon particles, they detract from the overall conductivity of the active layer. Hence, it is difficult to obtain a balance between hydrophobicity, catalyst activity, retention of surface area and reduction in electric power requirement for conducting this electrochemical reaction which takes place in chlor alkali cells. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The field of the present invention is the use of partially fluorinated carbons of the formula CF, where x 0.1 to about 0.18, viz., compounds of the x formula CFX 0.1 to about 0.18, in either the backing wetproofing layer of an oxygen air cathode or other gas electrode , or in the active layer thereof, or in both the backing and active layers. When used in the backing layer, the CFX 0.1 to about 0.18 partially fluorinated carbons are based on carbon black, viz., are arrived at by partially fluorinating carbon black, and are mixed with PTFE to prepare backing layers containing from about 50 to about 8Q weight parts CFX 0.1 to about 0.18 withC being carbon black and from about 20 to about 50 weight parts of PTFE.Typically such CFX 0.1 to about 0.18 component has particles ranging in size from about 50 to about 3000 angstroms. The particle size of the PTFE component ranges from about 0.05 to about 0.5 micron. Such backing layers have a combination of enhanced electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity. When used in an active layer, the CFx 0.1 to about 0.18 compounds are based on active carbon, viz., are prepared by partially fluorinating active carbon and can be used as such uncatalyzed or they can be catalyzed, e.g., using a precious metal catalyst and incorporated into the active layer, e.g., by Teflonating them and processing into an active layer as more fully described hereinbelow. PRIOR ART U.S. Patent No. 3,385,780 to I Ming Feng discloses a thin porous electrode which consists of a thin layer of polytetrafluoroethylene pressed against a thin layer of polytetrafluoroethylene containing finely divided platinized carbon wherein the platinum is present in weight concentrations of 1.2 Ãª to 0.1 milligrams of platinum per cm of catalyst surface. This platinized particulate carbon is present in the electrically conducting face of the thin electrode. Heat decomposable filler materials are utilized in conjunction with the polytetrafluoroethylene and conductive carbon particles to assist in forming the aforementioned composite thin porous electrode.Although the patentee states that the preferred electrically conductive material is finely divided carbon, there is no specific disclosure of active carbon, viz., carbon characterized by B.E.T. surface areas ranging from about 600 to 2000 square meters per gram in the form of agglomerates or aggregates with particle sizes of 10 to 50 microns relatively amorphous and of low graphitic character and an internal pore volume of 70 to 80 percent, e.g., 74 percent, to the particle. There is no mention in U.S. Patent No. 3,385,780 of fluorination of carbon particles for any purpose, whatsoever. The backing layer in this patent is PTFE, per se, which is not conductive. U.S. Patent No. 4,135,995 to Cletus N. Welch discloses a cathode having a hydrophilic portion formed of a solid intercalation compound of fluorine and carbon having the emperical formula CFX, where x is between 0.25 and 1.00. Intercalation compound of carbon and fluorine is defined to mean a carbonaceous material crystallized in a graphitic layer lattice with the layer atoms being approximately 1.41 angstroms apart, the layers being a greater distance apart, e.g., at least about 3.35 angstroms, and with fluorine atoms present between the layers. An alternative definition is given by the patentee wherein intercalation compounds of carbon and fluorine are defined as fluorinated graphites and graphite fluorides characterized by an infrared spectrum showing an absorption band at 1,220 centimeters 1. These particulate intercalation compounds can be incorporated into a cathode structure wherein a portion of a current carrier has applied thereto such intercalation compound s and another portion thereof has a hydrophobic material, e.g., polyfluoroethylene PTFE deposited thereon.The cathode can be employed as an air oxygen cathode. Alternatively, the entire particle may be formed of the intercalation compound and a portion thereof may be coated with the hydrophobic material. The present invention is readily distinguishable from that of WelchU.S. Patent 4,135,995. With regard to the utilization of the CFx 0.1 to about 0.18 partially fluorinated carbon blacks in backing layers according to this invention, the extent of fluorination is markedly less than in Welch who fails to specify what type of carbon is used. Secondly, the CFX 0.1 to about 0.18 partially fluorinated carbon blacks are hydrophobic and characterized by greater hydrophobicity after fluorination than before. Thirdly, it will be observed that the Welch intercalation compounds are fluorinated graphites or graphite fluorides versus the partially fluorinated carbon blacks used in the backing layers pursuant to this invention. Carbon blacks show significant differences when compared with graphitic blacks due to their respective structures. Similar distinctions are present between the active carbon based CFX 0.1 to about 0.18 partially fluorinated active carbons used according to this invention in electrode active layers and the Welch patent graphitic fluorides or fluorinated graphites. Firstly, the partially fluorinated active carbon particles have been reacted with fluorine chemically to produce compounds of carbon and fluorine of the formula CFX, wherein x ranges from 0.1 to about 0.18, and more preferably from about 0.12 to 0.16. Use of CFX compounds having these extents of fluorination is nowhere contemplated in said Welch patent.Secondly, the intercalation compounds of carbon and. fluorine whose use is contemplated byWelch are fluorinated graphite and graphite fluorides whereas the partially fluorinated active carbon compounds used in the present invention active layers are amorphous active carbons having a high B.E.T. surface area, e.g., in excess of 600 m2 g, and as such, they are not considered as fluorinated graphites or graphite fluorides within the meaning and context expressed in the Welch patent. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION CF 0.1 TO ABOUT 0.18 ACTIVE CARBONS IN ACTIVE LAYERS The partially fluorinated active carbon particles employed in accordance with this invention are active carbon particles as defined above having a particle size of less than about 50 microns with a preponderant concentration thereof having a particle size within the range of about 10 to about 20 microns. The active carbon whose use is contemplated in accordance with this invention encompasses a variety of materials which in general, prior to the partial fluorination, encompass a variety of amorphous carbonaceous materials, generally of vegetable origin which contain inorganic residue, e.g., noncarbonaceous oxides, collectively designed as ash. In accordance with one preferred embodiment of this invention, the active carbon starting material is RB carbon which is a form of active carbon manufactured by Calgon, a division of Merck, and is made from bituminous coal by known procedures. This material can contain as much as approximately 23 percent of various oxides and components which can be collectively designated as ash. Typical analysis of the ash contained in RB carbon is as follows Component Weight Concentration Silica 43.34 Alumina A12O3 29.11 Iron Oxides Fe2O3 20.73 Others 6.82 Preferably, the active carbon is deashed. This deashing does not totally remove the ash content from the active carbon but results in a substantial reduction thereof, viz., from about 70 to 80 percent or more of the ash is removed.The deashing procedure is described and claimed in U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 202,580 Docket 3194 , filed on October 31, 1980, in the name of Frank Solomon and entitled Active Carbon Conditioning Process. The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference. The initial stage of deashing treatment constitutes contacting the active carbon particles as obtained, e.g., RB carbon, as mentioned above, with either an acid or an alkali followed by contact with the other. For example, during the alkali base contacting stage, the alkali material, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc., is maintained at elevated temperatures ranging from about 90 to about 140 C and several contacting steps are used over time periods of, e.g., 0.5 to 25 hours, followed by one or more intermittent water washing step s . Then the thus treated active carbon is contacted with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, for similar extended time periods at ambient temperatures. Between the alkali and acid contacting phases, the active carbon particles can optionally be dried. However, drying is not required in accordance with this invention. Usually, the alkali is employed in the form of an aqueous solution containing from 28 to 55, and more usually from 35 to 45 weight percent alkali based on total solution. The acid content of the aqueous acid solution customarily ranges from 10 to 30 weight percent and more usually from 15 to 25 weight percent acid based on total solution. Prior to contact with the alkali solution, it has been found desirable to first classify or comminute, e.g., ball mill or otherwise divide up the active carbon particles as purchased to a particle size of 5 to 20 microns. For example, RB active carbon was ball milled for 2 to 6 hours, and more usually approximately 4 hours to reduce its particle size from about 30 to 50 microns to about 5 to 20 microns. Usually the alkali washing stage is performed in several individual washing steps using a hot 1000 to 1300C alkali solution. After the alkali washing has been completed, the alkali is neutralized using one or more water washing step s to remove the alkali prior to the acid wash stage. Similarly, the acid washing stage can be accomplished in several discrete washing steps rather than all at one time. Additionally, the contact with acid can be accomplished at lower temperatures for longer periods of time.For example, the acid wash can be conducted overnight approximately 16 hours at room temperature. As with the alkali contact stage preferably after the acid contact, the active carbon particles are subjected to a water washing to remove the acid followed by drying. Alternatively, the acid stage can be conducted at elevated temperatures using a Soxhlet extraction constant reflux apparatus, e.g., using HCl, HBr, etc., at 1100 to 1300C for about 0.5 hr., viz., constant boiling mineral acids, each having its respective boiling range. While many acids may suitably be employed, the acid of choice is hydrochloric acid. The sequential deashing pretreatment results in substantial reduction of the aforementioned ash content of the active carbon particles. Typically, when utilizing active carbon having an initial B.E.T. surface area of 600 to 1500 m2 g square meters per gram and pretreating it with alkali and acid, reductions of ash content from about 12 weight percent to not more than about 4 weight percent accompanied by increases in B.E.T. surface area of up to 50 percent have been accomplished. The active carbon particles preferably deashed within the above particle size range and surface area are contacted with fluorine, viz., F2, usually in a fluidized bed where the active carbon particles comprise the particulate bed material and wherein the fluidizing gas is F2 in argon wherein the F2 concentration ranges from about 0.5 to 5.0 weight percent, based on F2 plus argon. The fluidization can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about 100 C to 350 C over time periods ranging from about 5 to about 60 minutes to produce the CFX compounds, where x ranges from about Q1 to about 0.18. The extent of fluorination of the CF 0.1 to 0.18 material can be determined in x accordance with known analytical procedures.For example, the sample can be subjected to combustion and then either titrated with thorium nitrate in the presence of an indicator, or a fluoride sensitive electrode can be used. The partially fluorinated active carbon particles having the abovedescribed particle size range and porosity characteristics can then be catalyzed, viz., contacted with a precious metal precursor material which is then chemically or otherwise reduced resulting in deposition of a precious metal on and or within the pores thereof, such as platinum, etc., or any of the catalytic materials disclosed at column 7 of the Welch U.S. Patent No. 4,135,995. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, when the deposited catalytic material is platinum, it is deposited in accordance with the method set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,044,193. This procedure essentially involves deposition of H3Pt 503 2OH on the partially fluorinated active carbon particles followed by reduction using hydrogen peroxide or hydrazine. The catalyzed or uncatalyzed, partially fluorinated, deashed active carbon particles can then be Teflonated, viz., provided with a discontinuous, adherent coating of smaller polytetrafluoroethylene particles around the larger active carbon particles. This discontinuous coating is obtained by adding a dilute dispersion containing particulate polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE , e.g., du Pont Teflon 30 having a particle size of about from 0.05 to 0.5 micron in water to an aqueous mix of the active particles and water in a weight ratio of from about 15 to 35 weight parts of PTFE to from about 65 to about 85 weight parts of active carbon. The thus Teflonated1, active carbon particles were then filtered and dried by heating at about 1000 to 1400C. If desired, the PTFE wetting agent can be removed by extracting with chloroform in the manner described and claimed in U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 202,584 Docket 3198 , filed in the name of Frank Solomon onOctober 31, 1980, and entitled Extraction Treatment The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference. The Teflonated, partially fluorinated active carbon particles can then be combined with a particulate, subsequently removable fugitive pore forming agent prior to formation into an active layer sheet for use in an electrode. The pore former can be a soluble one, e.g., sodium carbonate, or a volatile agent, e.g., ammonium benzoate. Alternatively, the particulate poreformer can be initially combined with an intimate mix of carbon black and particulate polytetrafluoroethylene and this mix then combined with the Teflonated partially fluorinated active carbon. Resitivity measurements on the partially fluorinated active carbon particles CFx, where x 0.1 to about 0.18, utilized according to this invention reveal that as the degree of fluorination substantially exceeds about 0.2, the resistivity increases dramatically causing such materials to be unsuitable for use in this invention. The utilization of CFx 0.1 to about 0.18 partially fluorinated active carbons in active layers according to this invention will be illustrated further in the examples which follow in which all parts, percents and ratios are by weight, unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 Commercially available ball milled RB carbon was found to have an ash content of approximately 12 percent as received. This RB carbon was deashed by treating it in 38 percent KOH for 16 hours at 115or and found to contain 5.6 percent ash content after a subsequent furnace operation. The alkali treated RB carbon was then treated immersed for 16 hours at room temperature in 1 1 aqueous hydrochloric acid 20 percent concentration . The active carbon was finally washed with water until relatively acid free, the pH of the wash water being approximately 3.5. The active carbon was then dried at 110 C overnight. The resulting ash content had been reduced to 2.8 percent. Resistivity measurements were taken under compaction pressure of 500 psi on RB active carbon without deashing , and four deashed RB active carbons which were partially fluorinated to the extents indicated below, vizof where x 0.14, 0.15, 0.34 and 0.44, respectively. These carbons were fluorinated by MarChem, Inc. of Houston, Texas, and were assigned the designations of RBFo 14 RBFo 15 RBFo 34 and RBF0.44, respectively. The resistivity values obtained for each are tabulated below. TABLE 1 Active Carbon RB RBFo.l4 RBF0.15 RBF0 34 RBFo.44 Resistivity 0.36 1.00 1.26 22.2 Immeasurably ohm centimeters High EXAMPLE 2 The deashed active carbon RBF0.14 was then provided with platinum catalyst generally in accordance with the method set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,044,193. Specifically, 9 grams of deashed RBFo 14 were slurried in 150 mls of water and 5 mls of H3Pt S03 20H 200 g Pt per liter of solution were added thereto. The pH was adjusted to 3 with IN NaOH aqueous solution and 12 mls of 35 percent hydrogen peroxide were added. After stirring for an hour, the pH was readjusted to 3 with IN NaOH and the solution was heated to 800C until all bubbling stopped. The thus platinized active carbon was then filtered and dried at l400C. The resulting product had 10 percent Pt. The thus platinized RBFo 14 was Teflonated to a 20 percent level 20 percent PTFE, 80 percent RBFo 14 using Teflon 30 in the manner previously set forth. Then Shawinigan Black a commercially available acetylene carbon black was ,Teflonated to a 30 percent level using Teflon 30 and mixed with 1 to 4 micron classified sodium carbonate pore former . Two and one half parts of the Teflonated RBFo 14 and one part of the Teflonated carbon black sodium carbonate were then mixed and the mixture was rolled into a thin active layer sheet approximately 0.020 inch 20 mils thick by passing it between six inch diameter chrome plated steel rollers heated to a temperature of about 800C. A PTFE wetproofing backing layer was prepared as follows Two hundred cubic centimeters of isopropyl alcohol were poured into an Osterizer blender. Then 49 grams of du Pont 6A polytetrafluoroethylene were placed in the blender and the PTFE alcohol dispersion was blended at the blend position for approximately one minute. The resulting slurry had a thick, pasty consistency. Then.another 100 cc of isopropyl alcohol were added in the blender, and the mixture was blended again at the blend position for an additional two minutes. Then 91 grams of particulate sodium carbonate in isopropanol ball milled and having an average particle size of approximately 3.5 microns as determined by a Fisher Sub Sieve Sizer were added to the blender. This PTFE sodium carbonate mixture was then blended at the blend position in the Osterizer blender for three minutes followed by a higher speed blending at the liquefying position for an additional one minute. The resulting PTFElsodium carbonate slurry was then poured from the blender onto a Buchner funnel and filtered and then placed in an oven at 8000 where it was dried for three hours resulting in 136.2 grams yield of PTFE sodium carbonate mixture. This mixture contained approximately 35 weight parts of PTFE and 65 weight parts of sodium carbonate. This mixture was then mildly fibrillated in a Brabender Prep Center with attached Sigma mixer. After fibrillating, which compresses and greatly attenuates the PTFE, the fibrillated material is chopped to a fine, dry powder using a coffee blender, i.e., Type Varco, Inc. Model 228 1.00, made in France. Chopping to the desired extent takes from about 5 to 10 seconds because the mix is friable. The extent of chopping can be varied as long as the material is finely chopped. The chopped PTFE Na2CO3 mix is fed to 6 inch diameter chromeplated steel rolls heated to about 80 C. Typically, these rolls are set at a gap of 0.008 inch 8 mils for this operation. The sheets are formed directly in one pass and are ready for use as backing layer in forming electrodes, e.g., oxygen cathodes, with no further processing beyond cutting, trimming to size and the like. Such PTFE backing layers are described and claimed in US. PatentApplication Serial No. 202,583 Docket 3197 , filed in the name of Frank Solomon and Charles Grun on October 31, 1980, and entitled One Pass Process forForming Electrode Backing Sheet. The disclosure of this copending application is incorporated herein by reference. An oxygen air electrode was then made from the rolled active layer sheet by laminating one side the working surface thereof to a 58 x 60 x 0.004 inch woven silver plated nickel wire mesh current distributor having a .0003 inch thick silver plating, and on its other side to the PTFE wetproofing layer described herein at 8 tons in2 pressure and I 100C in a hydraulic press for approximately 3 minutes. The PTFE backing layer made as described above, when washed free of sodium carbonate, is characterized as porous, self sustaining, coherent, unsintered, uniaxially oriented backing wetproofing layers of fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene having pore openings of about 0.1 to 40 microns depending on the size of the pore former used . This laminated electrode was tested in 30 percent aqueous NaOH at 700C with carbon dioxide free air, viz., air having the CO2 removed, supplied at 4 times the theoretical air requirement for an oxygen cathode in a chlor alkali Ãª cell under a current density of 300 ma cm. Over a 1080hour test period of operation, the potentials ranged form 0.68 to 0.55 volt versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. EXAMPLE 3 Three laminated electrodes were formed using the PTFE backing layer and silver plated nickel woven wire mesh as in Example 2 but using three different active layers and tested in accordance with known procedures to determine double layer capacitance Farads at 850C in nine 9 molar NaOH with oxygen provided over varying extended time periods as reflecting loss of surface area indicating loss of activity after varying periods of operation hours . Figure 1 of the drawings is a graph plotting capacitance versus hours of operation for these three laminated electrodes. One active layer Curve 1 as indicated by solid circles in Figure 1 contains 75 percent platinized deashed RB active carbon particles and 25 percent particulate PTFE, having approximately I.1 mg Pt cm2 of said active carbon. The second active layer Curve 2 as indicated by open circles onFigure 1 contains 71 percent of a mixture of 80 percent platinized, deashed RB carbon partially fluorinated to the extent where x 0.14, viz., deashed RBF and 29 percent of a carbon black matrix containing 70 percent Shawinigan Black and 30 percent particulate PTFE, wherein the platinized RBF014 contains 1.5 Ãª mg Pt cm of said partially fluorinated active carbon. The third active layer Curve 3 as indicated by circles with an contains 80 percent of an approximately equal mixture of uncatalyzed RBFo 14 and uncatalyzed RBFo 15 and 20 percent particulate PTFE. As will be noted from Figure 1, both partially fluorinated materials Curves 2 and 3 show a more constant rate of surface loss or activity decline after extended periods of operation establishing an exponential or asymptotic relationship of decline versus the straight line decline observed with the unfluorinated material of Curve 1. In short, the CFx 0.1 to 0.18 partially fluorinated active carbons yield electrode active layers which last longer in operation compared with their active carbon counterparts having no fluorination. Basically, this is the case whether said CFX 0.1 to 0.18 active carbons are catalyzed or uncatalyzed. EXAMPLE 4 Two laminated test electrodes were made in accordance with the method of Example 2 using the same PTFE backing layer and silver plated nickel woven wire mesh current distributor as in Example 2. These laminates were then tested for performance in nine 9 molar NaOH with oxygen available wherein the current density milliamperes cm2 was varied up to 1000 ma cm2 to note the potential volts , as compared with a standard Reversible Hydrogen Electrode RHE , at varying current densities. The laminated electrode of the Figure 2 Curve 1 solid circles had an active layer containing 75 percent deashed RB active carbon and 25 percentPTFE whereas that of the Figure 2 Curve 2 open circles with an tax had 80 percent of substantially an equal mixture by weight of deashed RBF0.14 and RBFo 15 partially fluorinated active carbons and 20 percent PTFE. Neither active carbon was catalyzed, nor did either contain a carbon black matrix. As will be observed from Figure 2 plotting current density versus potential , the laminated electrode whose active layer contained the RBF, 0.1 to 0.18 was superior in performance to that containing RB active carbon, per se, particularly at the more demanding, viz., higher current densities. CF 0.1 TO ABOUT 0.18 CARBON BLACKS IN BACKING x LAYERS The present invention contemplates the use of carbon black as defined in an article entitled FUNDAMENTALS OF CARBON BLACKTECHNOLOGY by Frank Spinelli appearing in the AMERICAN INK MAKER,August, 1970. Carbon black is a generic term referring to a family of industrial carbons which includes lampblacks, channel blacks, furnace blacks and thermal blacks. In general, carbon black is made by incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of a liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon. A preferred class of carbon blacks are the acetylene carbon blacks, e.g., made from acetylene by continuous thermal decomposition, explosion, by combustion in an oxygen deficient atmosphere, or by various electrical processes.Characteristically, these acetylene blacks contain 99.5 weight percent carbon and have a particle size ranging from about 50 to about 2000 angstrom units. The density of the acetylene black material is approximately 1.95 grams per cubic centimeter. More preferably, the acetylene black is a commercially available acetylene black known by the designation Shawinigan Black and has an average particle size of about 425Angstroms. Such acetylene blacks are somewhat hydrophobic, e.g., as de mon strated by the fact that the particles thereof float on cold water but quickly sink in hot water. The hydrophobic electroconductive electrode backing layers were prepared in accordance with this invention by combining the PTFE in particulate form as a dispersion with the acetylene black particles as described above.According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, the acetylene black employed is that having an average particle size of approximately 425 Angstrom units with a standard deviation of 250 Angstom units. The range of particle size is from about 50 to about 2000 Angstroms. Partially fluorinated Shawinigan Black was purchased fromMarChem, Inc. of Houston, Texas. These partially fluorinated acetylene blacks are compounds of the formula Cox, where x ranges from 0.1 to about 0.18. The hydrophobicity of the already hydrophobic carbon black particles is enhanced by the partial fluorination as was observed from comparative experiments wherein unfluorinated acetylene black particles floated on cold water but quickly sank in hot water versus the partially fluorinated acetylene blacks, fluorinated to the extent of x being about 0.1 to about 0.18, which floated on hot water virtually indefinitely and could not be made to pierce the meniscus of the water. Hydrophobic electroconductive electrode backing wetproofing layers were prepared in accordance with this invention by combining the PTFE in particulate form as a dispersion with the partially fluorinated carbon black particles described above. Partially fluorinated Shawinigan Black acetylene carbon black , CFO 1 to 0.18 was suspended in isopropyl alcohol and placed in an ultrasonic generator. Gradually a dilute aqueous dispersion of PTFE du Pont s Teflon 30 , containing 2 weight percent PTFE, was added thereto to Teflonate the CFO 1 to 0.18 particles1 viz., form an intimate mixture thereof.The PTFE CFol to 0.18 mix was then filtered, dried, treated to remove the PTFE wetting agent by heating at 3000C for 20 minutes in air or extracting it with chloroform briefly chopped to form a granular mix and then fabricated into sheet form either by a passing between. heated rollers 65 to 900C , or b by dispersion of said PTFElCFx 0.1 to 0.18 particles in a liquid dispersion medium capable of wetting said particles and filtration on a salt NaCl bed previously deposited on filter paper or like filtration media, or c by spraying the CFO 1 to o 18 PTFE mix in a mixture of water and alcohol, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, on an electrode active layericurrent distributor composite assembly and drying to yield a fine pore wetproofing layer. The Teflonated mix can contain from about 50 to 80 weight percent CFX 0.1 to 0.18 and about 20 to 50 weight percent PTFE. In any case, a pore former can be incorporated into the Coo 1 to 0.1 , P FE mix prior to forming the wetproofing layer or sheet. The pore former can be of the soluble type, e.g., sodium carbonate or the like, or the volatile type, e.g., ammonium benzoate or the like. The use of ammonium benzoate as a fugitive, volatile pore former is described and claimed in U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 202,583 Docket 3197 , filed in the name of Frank Solomon on October 31, 1980. The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference. Whether the wetproofing sheet is formed by rolling, filtration or spraying, the pore former can be removed by washing if a soluble one or heating if a volatile one either prior to laminating the wetproofing layer to the current distributor and active layer, or after lamination thereof. In cases where a soluble pore former is used, the laminate is preferably given a hot 500 to about 1000C soak in an alkylene polyol, e.g., ethylene glycol or the like, prior to water washing for 10 to 60 minutes. The ethylene glycol hot soak imparts enhanced resistance of such laminated electrodes to blistering during water washing and is the subject matter described and claimed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.202,573 Docket 3200 entitled Electrode Layer Treating Process and filed of even date herewith in the name of Frank Solomon. The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference. When the wetproofing layer is formed by filtration, it can be released from the filter media by washing with water to dissolve the salt bed, drying and pressing lightly to consolidate same, followed by laminating to the current distributor and active layer. Alternatively, the filter paper salt wetproofing layer assembly can be laminated to the current distributor and active layer with the filter paper side away from the current distributor and the wetproofing layer side in contact with the current distributor followed by dissolving the salt away. The testing of the electroconductive, hydrophobic backing layers of this invention in the corrosive environment of use of a chlor alkali cell has revealed a desirable combination of electroconductivity with balanced hydro phobicity and said layer is believed to have achieved a desired result in the oxygen air cathode field. The invention will be further illustrated in the examples which follow in which parts, percents and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of PTFE SBF0 17 One and one half 1.5 grams of partially fluorinated ShawiniganBlack fluorinated to the level where x 0.17 , hereinafter referred to as SBF0 17, were suspended in 30 mls of isopropyl alcohol and placed in a small ultrasonic bath Model 250, RAI Inc. where it was simultaneously stirred and ultrasonically agitated. Sixty eight one hundredths 0.68 ml of du Pont Teflon 30 aqueousPTFE dispersion was diluted with 20 mls of water and added dropwise from a separatory funnel to the SBF0.17 dispersion gradually, over approximately a 10minute period with stirring, followed by further stirring for approximately one hour. This material was then filtered, washed with water and dried at 1100C. EXAMPLE 6 PTFE SBFO 17 Wetproofing Layer by Filtration Method A PTFE SBFO 17 conductive, hydrophobic wetproofing layer or sheet was prepared by the filtration method as follows two hundred twenty five 225 milligrams of the PTFE S.BFO.L7 mix, prepared in accordance with Example 1, were chopped in a small high speed coffee grinder Varco Model 228 1, made inFrance for about 30 to 60 seconds and then dispersed in 250 mls of isopropyl alcohol in a Waring Blender. This dispersion was then filtered onto a salt paper, viz., NaCI on filter paper, of 19 cm2 area to form a cohesive, selfsustaining wetproofing layer having an area density of 10.6 mg cm Resistivity of this wetproofing layer was measured and found to be 8.8 ohmsentimeters. Separately a control wetproofing layer test strip was formed using unfluorinated Shawinigan Black, and its resistivity was measured and found to be 0.53 ohm cm. The resistivity of pure PTFE from Teflon 30 is greater than 1015 ohm cm by way of comparison. Although the resistivity of the PTFE SBFO 17 wetproofing layer is about 16.6 times that of the unfluorinated SB carbon black, it is still low enough to be useful in forming electrodes when in intimate contact with a current distributor. Permeability is an important factor in high current density operation of a gas electrode having hydrophobic conductive or nonconductive backing, viz., a wetproofing or liquid barrier layer. The wetproofing layers of this invention have adequate permeability comparable to that of pure PTFE backings even when pressed at up to 5 tons in2 yet have far superior electroconductivity. Although in accordance with this invention, the laminated electrodes are usually made with the PTFE CFo 1 to 0.18 backing layer laminated to the active layer with the current distributor on the active layer side since said backing layers are electroconductive, the current distributor can be laminated on the backing layer side. The extent of fluorination of the CF 0.1 to 0.18 material can be x determined in accordance with known analytical procedures. For example, the sample can be subjected to combustion and then either titrated with thorium nitrate in the presence of an indicator, or a fluoride sensitive electrode can be used.
