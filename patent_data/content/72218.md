# A PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN ACRYLIC OR METHACRYLIC ACID ESTER

## Abstract
Acrylic or methacrylic acid is esterified with an alcohol in an aqueous medium containing a water insoluble and non reactive organic solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst, the volume ratio of the organic solvent phase to the aqueous solu tion phase of the acid catalyst being 0.1 1 to 1.0 1. The use of this low organic solvent aqueous phase ratio permits the use of a small sized reactor while conversion to the ester is kept high. The acrylic or methacrylic acid ester is a useful starting material for acrylic resins, acrylic resin coatings, adhesives, etc.
