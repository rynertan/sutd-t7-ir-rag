# Insert for a hose coupling.

## Abstract
A substantially tubular shaped insert 1 adapted to fit coaxially about the end of a hose 12 and to be contract ed against the hose 12 by a shell 13 of a coupling to provide a hose coupling assembly for the conveyance of fluids under pressure. The insert 1 has a separation space 2 in its wall that extends longitudinally along the entire length thereof and one or more longitudinaily ex tending primary elongate openings 4 through its wall that are disposed in a substantial uniform array about its cir cumference. The longitudinal axis of space 2 and the axis of the openings 4 are skewed from 0 to about 45 from the insert s central axis and the areas provided by space 2 and openings 4 are such that, upon contraction of the insert 1 against the hose 12 , portions of the wall of the hose 12 are caused to extend into space 2 and openings 4 to provide circumferentially uniform longitudi nally extending engagement between the coupling and the hose 12 .
