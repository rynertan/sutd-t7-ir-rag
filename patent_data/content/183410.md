# Electrocardiograph sensor positioning device.

## Abstract
An electrocardiograph sensor positioning device in cludes a pair of sensor locating members 12,14 that are angularly adjustable with respect to each other to a deter minable angular position. Co operative indicia means 50,72 provided on each of the sensor locating members furnish an indication of the relative angular position therebetween. Each of the sensor locating members defines a plurality of location zones 34,38 56 64 for positioning of the electro cardiograph sensors and indicia means 40,42,68 are pro vided alongside the location zone to determine the precise location of the electrocardiograph sensors when they are positioned in the location zones. The electrocardiograph sensor positioning device thus permits the establishment of reference paths on the human anatomy which are used to locate the positions of the electrocardiograph sensors. The size and extent of the reference paths and the pivotal arrangement of one of the sensor locating members permits adaptation of the device to a relativey wide range of anatomical size and shape regardless of sex.
