# Method and circuit for generating a time varying signal.

## Abstract
A method for approximating signals having sinusoidal waveforms with signals having trapezoidal waveforms, and a circuit for generating digital dual tone multi frequency DTMF dialing signals. The trapezoidal waveforms have sloped portions each equal in duration to one third of a period, and flat portions each equal in duration to one sixth of the period. DTMF dialing signals are generated by forming two such trapezoidal waveforms. The circuit forms trapezoid al waveforms by a computational technique. A periodic triangular waveform is first formed by repetitiously adding and subtracting an incremental value at a succession of time intervals. Then, the peaks of the triangular waveform are truncated to form the trapezoidal waveform.
