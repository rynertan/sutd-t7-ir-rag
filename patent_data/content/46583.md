# Hollow fiber type artificial lung having enclosed heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A hollow fiber type artificial lung having an enclosed heat exchanger, having a first housing 1 and a second housing 21 connected together coaxially. A gas exchange chamber 8 is defined in the first housing by a pair of spaced walls 6,7 and a bundle 15 of hollow fibers 5 designed for gas exchange is extended lengthwise and between the pair of walls. The hollow fiber bundle is preferably constricted at the central portion 16 to increase the packing ratio of the hollow fibers. The second housing 21 that is connected to the first housing 1 by way of the blood chamber 38 has a pair of spaced apart walls 26,27 , and multiple tubes 25 are provided to extend lengthwise between the pair of walls to effect heat exchange between the circulating heat exchange medium and the blood flowing through the multiple tubes.
