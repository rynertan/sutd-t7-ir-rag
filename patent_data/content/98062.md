# Vehicle lamp assemblies.

## Abstract
A vehicle lamp assembly is disclosed for use when the outer cover or lens element extends round the corner of the vehicle or when the outer cover or lens element is signifi cantly larger in one or two mutually perpendicular directions than in the other. The lamp assembly comprises a light source 16 , a light transmitting cover element 12 and a light transmitting intermediate element 18 disposed be tween the source 16 and the cover element 12 . The intermediate element 18 has coaxial cylindrical inner and outer surfaces located with the light source of their common axis, one of the cylindrical surfaces carrying elongated Fresnel prism formations of uniform cross section extending parallel to the common axis and the other cylindrical surface carrying elongate Fresnel prism formations of constant cross section extending in respective planes perpendicular to said common axis.
