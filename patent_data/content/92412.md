# DEVICE FOR EMITTING SUPER FLUORESCENT LIGHT

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device with one dimensional pseudo reflection layer plate series which is able to emit photon pulses 15 with coherent phase, and a type of quantum stand ing photon wave oscillation in between the layer plates, by pumping with high energy exciting photons 11 . The device has a series of plates 2 of a fluorescent material, stacked alternately between supporting, light transmissive layers 1 . The time taken for the light wave to pass between the supporting layers 1 is set smaller than a time constant of spontaneous emission in atoms of the fluo rescent material. The coherent light emitted can be in the range from visible light to X rays.
