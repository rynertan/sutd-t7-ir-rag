# PRESSURE REGULATING HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT AND VALVE

## Abstract
For work vehicles, for example, cold weather can be a problem. Disengaging the vehicle clutch 26 aids starting by reducing engine loads during starting. Where the clutch 26 is hydraulically actuated, it can be disengaged by keeping fluid pressures below required engagement pressure when sup plying other elements common to the clutch hydraulic circuit. Apparatus is provided which during starting directs fluid to, for example, pump drive bearings 20 at less than clutch engagement pressure. An input signal to the apparatus from the vehicle operator after engine start up then builds pressure to activate the clutch 26 while continuing to supply the pump drive bearings for lubrication. Upon a preselected fluid flow to the apparatus, such as at engine shutdown, the apparatus automatically returns to the condition at which available pres sure levels are less than required for clutch engagement. Thus, cold starting problems are substantially eliminated by automatically providing a clutch disengaged situation in the vehicle during engine start up.
