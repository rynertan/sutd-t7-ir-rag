DETAILS OF THE INVENTIONSYnthesis Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the procedures shown in Equations 1. 4. and 5. R, El, J and A are as previously defined. Reaction conditions are given for guidance and illustration only. Equation 1EMI15.1 The reaction of Equation 1 is best carried out in an inert aprotic organic solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane. tetrahydrofuran, or acetonitrile, at a temperature between 200 and 85 C. The order of addition is not critical however, it is often convenient to add the sulfonyl isocyanate, or a solution of it in the reaction solvent, to a stirred suspension of the amine. In some cases. the desired product is insoluble in the reaction solvent at ambient temperature and crystallizes from it in pure form. Products soluble in the reaction solvent are isolated by evaporation of the solvent. Compounds of Formula I then may be purified by trituration of the evaporation residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane or ethyl ether and filtration, by recrystallization from mixtures of solvents such as 1.2 dichloroethane, l chlorobutane and heptane or by chromatography on silica gel. Sulfonyl isocyanates II. W is 0 are known in the art and are prepared from the corresponding sulfonamides IV by one of the following two general methods. Eouation 2EMI16.1 The sulfonamide IV is reacted with an alkyl isocyanate e.g , E butyl isocyanate in a solvent whose boiling point is above 135 C, such as xylene.The reaction can optimally be carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of 1,4 diaza 2.2.2 bicyclooctane DABCO . The reaction mixture is heated to 135 1400C and held at that temperature for 5 60 minutes, after which phosgene is slowly added at such a rate that the temperature remains between 133 and l35C. When the consumption of phosgene has ceased, the mixture is cooled and filtered to remove insoluble material. Finally, the solvent, alkyl isocyanate, and excess phosgene are evaporated, leaving the sulfonyl isocyanate II . If desired, the alkyl isocyanate sulfonamide adduct can be made and isolated before reaction with the phosgene. In this case the sulfonamide IV . alkyl isocyanate, and anhydrous base e.g, R2C03 in a polar, aprotic solvent e.g. acetone, butanone, or acetonitrile are mixed and heated under reflux for 1 to 6 hours. The reaction mixture is then diluted with water, and the pH is adjusted to about 3 with acid e.g. HCl, H2SO4 . The adduct is filtered out and dried, and then reacted with phosgene as described above. This procedure modification is especially useful when the sulfonamide IV is high melting and has low solubility in the phosgenation solvent. Sulfonyl isocyanates Il, W is 0 can also be prepared by the following method.Equation 3EMI17.1 The sulfonamide IV is heated at reflux in an excess of thionyl chloride. The reaction is continued until the sulfonamide protons are no longer detectable in the proton magnetic resonance spectrum. From 16 hours to 5 days is typically sufficient for complete conversion to the thionylamide V Equation 3a . The thionyl chloride is evaporated and the residue is treated with an inert solvent e.g. toluene containing at least one equivalent typically 2 3 equivalents of phosgene. A catalytic amount of pyridine typically 0.1 equivalent is added, and the mixture is heated to about 50 140 C. with BO lOOe preferred. Conversion to the isocyanate Il. W is O is usually substantially complete within 15 minutes to 3 hours Equation 3b . The mixture is then cooled and filtered, and the solvent is evaporated, leaving the sulfonyl isocyanate II. W is 0 . Sulfonyl isothiocyanates II, W is S are known in the art and are prepared from the corresponding sulfonamides IV by reaction with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by treatment of the resulting dipotassium salt with phosgene. Such a procedure is described in Arch. Pharm. 299, 174 1966 . Many of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the procedure shown in Equation 4.Equation 4EMI18.1 The reaction of Equation 4 is carried out by contacting phenylcarbamates or phenylthiocarbamates ofFormula VI with aminoheterocycles of Formula III in an inert organic solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures of about 20 1000C for a period of about one half to twenty four hours. The product can be isolated by evaporation of the reaction solvent and purified by methods previously described. Phenylcarbamates and phenylthiocarbamates ofFormula VI can be prepared by the methods described, or modifications thereof known to those skilled in the art. One such method is taught in U.S. 4,443.243. Alternatively, many of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the method described in Equation 5.Equation 5EMI18.2 The reaction of Equation 5 can be carried out by contacting equimolar amounts of a sulfonamide ofFormula IV with a heterocyclic phenylcarbamate or phenylthiocarbamate of Formula VII in the presence of a base such as 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU , by methods analogous to those described inSouth African Patent Application 83 0441. The phenylcarbamates and phenylthiocarbamates of Formula VII can be prepared by methods, or modifications thereof known to those skilled in the art. described in South AfricanPatent Application 82 5671 and South African PatentApplication 82 5045. Sulfonamides of formula IV can be prepared by one or both of the procedures shown in Equations 6a and 6b. Equation 6a illustrates the reaction of sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII with the appropriate amine or hydrazine derivative of Formula IX to give sulfonamides of Formula IV, Equation 6b illustrates the reaction of sulfonyl chlorides of Formula A with ammonia to give compounds of Formula IV wherein R1 and J are as previously defined.Equation 6EMI19.1 The reactions of Equations 6a and 6b are preferably carried out in an inert, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran. or acetonitrile at a temperature between 780 and 40 C. These reactions require the presence of a scavenger for the byproduct hydrochloric acid. This can be accomplished by the use of a two fold excess of the amine or the hydrazine derivative or by the addition of an equivalent of a base such as triethylamine. pyridine, or aqueous sodium hydroxide. In cases in which the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, they may be isolated by simple filtration followed by washing with water to remove hydrochloride salts.When the products are soluble, they can be isolated by filtration, to remove any insoluble salts, followed by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane, diethyl ether or ethyl acetate, and filtration. In some cases it is helpful to wash the product with water to remove residual salts. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII where H1 is as previously defined can be prepared by the methods shown in Equations 7 and 8. Diazotization of appropriately substituted aniline derivatives of Formula 1 as shown in Equation 7, and subsequent coupling with sulfur dioxide in the presence of either cupric or cuprous chloride gives the desired products of Formula VIII. This reaction can be accomplished by methods described. or modifications thereof known to those skilled in the art, in the Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Vol. 12, pages 648 to 655 1960 . Equation 7EMI21.1 The reaction of Equation 7 can be affected by analogous methods described in U.8. Patent No.4,310,346. In Equation 7, a substituted aniline XI, wherein H1 is not NRdRe in concentrated hydrochloric acid is treated with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 5 to 50C. After being stirred for 10 30 minutes at about 0 C, the solution is added to a mix ture of excess sulfur dioxide and a catalytic amount of cupric or cuprous chloride in acetic acid at about lO C. After stirring for 0.25 to 24 hours at temperatures between 10 to 25 C, the solution is poured into a large excess of ice water. The sulfonyl chloridesVIII can be isolated by filtration. or by extraction into a solvent such as methylene chloride or diethyl ether, followed by drying and evaporation of the solvent. Oxidative chlorination of appropriately substituted arylthioethers of Formula AT give the desired products wherein R13 is C2 to C4 alkyl or benzyl andR1 is not C1 to C3 a lkylthio. C1 to C3 alkylsulfinyl.C1 to C3 haloalkylthio, C2 to C3 alkylthioalkyl or C2 to C3 haloalkylthioalkyl.Equation 8EMI21.2 The reaction of Equation 8 can be carried out by treating a solution of the thioether XII in a solvent such as acetic acid in the presence of at least 2.5 equivalents of water and at least 3.0 equivalents of chlorine at 0 300C for .25 to 5 hours. The reaction is poured into ice water and the product is isolated by extraction with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, dried, and the solvent evaporated to yield a product sufficiently pure to be carried directly on to the next step. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula A in Equation 6b wherein J is NRR2 or NR 3R4 are known in the art and can be prepared by analogous methods described in U.S.Patent No. 4,310,346. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula A in Equation 6b wherein J is NR2NR3R4 can be prepared by the procedure shown in Equation 9 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R 4 are as previously defined. This procedure is best suited to cases in which both R3 and R 4 are other than H. Diazotization of appropriately substituted aniline derivatives of Formula XIII. as shown inEquation 9, and subsequent coupling with sulfur dioxide in the presence of either cupric or cuprous chloride give the desired products of Formula A. Equation 9EMI22.1 The reactions of Equation 9, wherein H1 is not NRdRe, can be carried out under the conditions described for the reactions of Equation 7. Aniline derivatives of Formula XI in Equation 7 can be prepared as shown in Equation 10 by reduction of the corresponding nitro compounds of Formula XIV wherein R1 is other than NO2.Equation 10EMI23.1 The reduction reactions of Equation 10 can be accomplished by methods known in the literature by those skilled in the art. For details see, for example, U.S. 4,511,392 and references cited therein.

Compounds of Formula 9 can be prepared as shown in Equation 12 by the reaction of ortho nitrobenzene sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XVI with the appropriate hydrazine derivatives of Formula It to give orthonitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazides of Formula tV. Eauation 12EMI24.1 The reaction of Equation 12 can be carried out under the conditions described for Equation 6. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XVI are known in the art and can be prepared by methods described inU.S. Patent No. 4,120,691. The primary and secondary amines of Formula IX wherein J is NRH2 or NR3R4 required for the reactions shown in Equation 6a are known in the art or can be prepared by one skilled in the art using methods known in the literature. In cases where the required secondary amine is not readily available, and Ra and Bb are other than H, it is more convenient to prepare sulfonamides ofFormula IV using the method of Equation 13. Equation 13a illustrates the reaction of orthonitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides of Formula XVI with primary amines to give secondary sulfonamides ofFormula XVII which can then be alkylated as shown inEquation 13b to give tertiary sulfonamides of FormulaXVIII. R1, R3, and R4 are as previously defined and B is an appropriate displaceable substituent such as C1,Br, 1. OSO2CR3, OSO2CF3, OsO2C6H5 or OSO2 p CH3C6H4. Plauation 13EMI25.1 The reactions of Equation 13a can be carried out under the conditions described for the reactions ofEquation 6. The reactions of Equation 13b are best carried out by the addition of a base such as triethylamine.DBU. or potassium carbonate to a solution of the secondary sulfonamide of Formula XVII in an aprotic polar solvent such as acetonitrile or N.N dimethylformamide at about 78 to IOOC. The alkylating agent is then added and after an additional one half to 24 hours at about 0 100 C the reaction mixture is added to water to precipitate the product. Solid products can be isolated by simple filtration. If necessary.the products can be extracted with a solvent such as ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The product is then isolated by drying and evaporation of the solvent and. when necessary. further purified by chromatography on silica gel. The nitro compounds of Formula XVIII can be converted to sulfonamides of Formula IV by the methods described in Equations 7 and 10. When R1 is other than C1 to C3 alkylthio. C1 toC3 alkylsulfinyl, C1 to C3 haloalkylthio. C2 to C3 alkylthioalkyl or C2 to C3 haloalkylthioalkyl. sulfon amides of Formula IVa wherein B2 is C3 to C6 epoxyalkyl and sulfonamides of Formula IVb wherein either or both R3 and R4 are C3 to C6 epoxyalkyl can be conveniently prepared by contacting the corresponding alkenyl derivatives with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or seta chloroperbenzoic acid using procedures which are well known in the art. The hydrazine. benzoyl hydrazine, acyl hydrazine, hydrazinocarboxylate, semicarbazide, thiosemicarbazide, and aminoguanidine derivatives of Formula IX in Equations 6a and 12 are known in the art or can be prepared by one skilled in the art using methods such as those reviewed by E. W. Schmidt in Hvdrazine and itsDerivates Preparation, Properties, ApplicationsJ. Wiley, New York. 1984 and by Smith in Derivatives of Hvdrazine and Other Hydronitrogene Having N N Bonds,Benjamin Cunnings, Reading Massachusetts. 1983. The preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein J is NR 2NR 3R 4 with certain combinations of tbe substitutents R 2, B . and R4 may be more conveniently achieved using a sulfonylurea of Formula I or a sulfonamide of Formula IV as the intermediate. For example, sulfonylureas of Formula 1 in which both H31 and R4 are H may be prepared by acid catalyzed hydrolysis of compounds of Formula I in which R 3 and R 4 are taken together to form CR 12R 13. This and other transformations may be accomplished by procedures which are known in the literature by those skilled in the art. In cases where R2, R3, or R4 is C1 to C6 alkyl substituted with OSO2R5. OC O R5. OCO2R5. OC 0 NR11R12, or OP O OR5 2 or H2,. R 3 or R 4 is C2 to C3 alkyl sub stituted with OSO2R 6, C O R6. OCO2R6, C O NR7R8 or P O OR6 it is often more convenient to first prepare the corresponding sulfonamides of Formula IV or sulfon ylureas of Formula I in which R2. R3, or R4 is C1 to C6 alkyl substituted with OH or R 2, R 3 or R 4 is C2 to C3 alkyl substituted with OH. The hydroxy group can then be functionalized to give the desired derivatives using methods which are well know in the art. When R1 is other than C1 to C3 alkylthio, C1 toC3 alkylsulfinyl. C1 to C3 haloalkylthio, C2 to C3 alkylthioalkyl or C2 to C3 haloalkylthioalkyl and H2, R3, or R4 is C1 to C6 alkyl substituted with S O nR7 and n is equal to 1 or 2, the sulfonamides of FormulasIVa and IVb or sulfonylureas of Formula I may also be prepared from the corresponding compounds in which n is equal to O by contact with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or meta chloroperbenzoic acid. The level of oxidation may be controlled by the amount of oxidant used and by the reaction temperature according to procedures which are known in the art. The heterocyclic amines of Formula III inEquation 3 above can be prepared by methods known in the literature, or simple modifications thereof. by those skilled in the art. For instance, EP A No.84,224 published July 27. 1983 and W. Braker et al.,J. Chem Soc.. 69. 3072 1947 describes methods for preparing aminopyridines and triazines substituted by acetal groups such as dialkoxymethyl or 1.3 dioxolan2 yl. among other groups. Also. for example, SouthAfrican patent application Nos. B2 5045 and 82 5671 describe methods for preparing aminopyrimidines and triazines substituted by haloalkyl or haloalkythio groups such as OCR2CR2F. OCR2CF3. SCF2R. or OCF2H among other groups.South African Patent ApplicationNo. 83 7434 published October 5. 1983 describes methods for the synthesis of cyclopropylpyrimidines and triazines substituted by such groups as alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy. alkylamino. dialkylamino or alkoxyalkyl. The 5,6 dihydrofuro 2,3 d pyrimidine 2 amines.the cyclopenta d pyrimidines 2 amines III, A is A 2 and the 6,7 dihydro 5H pyrano 2,3 d pyrimidin 2 amines III, A is A 3 are described in U.S. 4.487.626. Compounds of Formula III. where A is A 5, are described in U.S. 4.421.550. Compounds of FormulaIII. where A is A 6, are described in U.S. 4,496,392. In addition. general methods for preparing aminopyrimidines and triazines have been reviewed in the following publications The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds , a series published by Interscience Publishers, Inc.. NewYork and London Pyrimidines . Vol. 16 of the same series byD. J. Brown s Triazines and Derivatives Vol. 12 of the same series by E. M. Smolin and L. Rappoport and F. C. Schaefer. U.S. Patent 3,154,547 and K. R. Ruffian and F. C.. Schaefer. J. Org. Chem.. 28. 1812 1963 . which describes the synthesis of triazines. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds ofFormula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g.. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydroxide .Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by.passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts. useful in this invention.can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid. e.g.. toluene6ulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like.

They include dusts, granules. pellets, solutions. susvensions, exul6ions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like.Many of these may be applied directly. spray able formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few Liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about O.1S to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9S solid or liquid diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table VII Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including Emulsifiable Concentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Bigher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide. 2nd Ed.. Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.18 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheonn s Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual .MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc.. NewYork. 1964,. list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of addi tives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbio logical growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example. Littler. U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning. Agglomeration . Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s Chemical Engineer s Handbook , 4th Ed.. McGraw Hill, New York, 1963, pp. 8 59ff.

UtilitY Test results indicates that the compoundswotstfiew present invention are highly active preemergent or post emergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. Many of thea have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas. parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds have utility for selective weed control in crops such as wheat. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 10 kg ha.the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the teiazine, triazole.uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusqalli . wild oats Avena fatua , cheatgrass Bromus secalinus , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti , morningglory IPomoea spp. , cocklebur Xanthium PensYlvanicum . sorghum, corn, soybean, sugar beet, cotton, rice, wheat and purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus tubers were planted and treated preemergence with the test chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. At the same time, these crop and weed species were treated with a soil foliage application. At the time of treatment, the plants ranged in height from 2 to 18 cm.Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, after which all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment.The ratings, summarized in Table A, are based on a numerical scale extending from 0 I no injury, to 10 t complete kill. The accompanying descriptive symbols have the following meanings B burn C chlorosis necrosis D defoliation E I emergence inhibition G I growth retardation H I formative effect U I unusual pigmentation X axillary stimulation S 1 albinism and 6Y abscised buds or flowers.
