# A method of solid phase immunoassay incorporating a luminescent label.

## Abstract
A method of solid state immunoassay incorporating a lu minescent label for the quantitation of antigen, hapten or anti body analyte in a measured volume of a liquid sample com prises the following steps reacting the analyte or an analyte containing reaction pro duct with or in competition with or for an immunoreactant which is attached to i a plurality of water insoluble particles of about 10 Âµm or less in size, or ii cells, the particles or cells be ing in a substantially suspended state concentrating by microfiltration the water insoluble parti cles, or cells, which have, or which through subsequent reac tion will have, a luminescent label attached thereto, to a volume substantially less than the volume of the liquid sample and measuring the luminescence of substantially all of the lu minescent label attached to the concentrated water insoluble particles or cells.
