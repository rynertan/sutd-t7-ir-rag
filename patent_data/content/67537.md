# Process for the lowering of the oxidation state of metal salts.

## Abstract
The oxidation state of metal salts is lowered by contact ing a solution of the salt with polyacetylene in the presence of sufficient moisture to leave the polyacetylene substantial ly undoped. The metal salt must have a reductive capacity of at least 0.5. This process can be used to reduce metal salts to zero active valency metal. The moisture is effectively added by treating an aqueous solution of the salt, optionally with organic cosolvent. The zero valency metal can subse quently be recovered from the polyacetylene, for example by burning the polyacetylene off.
