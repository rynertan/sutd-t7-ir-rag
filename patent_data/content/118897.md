# PARTICLE COUNTING SYSTEM FOR A FRACTIONATING DEVICE

## Abstract
A method and system for generating a selective particle size population distribution of particles having a predeter mined nature. Particles having a nature different from that of the particles of interest are accounted for. The system includes a fractionating apparatus connected to a counting apparatus. The passage of a particle through the counting apparatus generates a signal representative of the presence of a particle and indicative of the nature of the particle.
