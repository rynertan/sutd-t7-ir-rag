# Primary radiator for circularly polarized wave.

## Abstract
A primary radiator 20 for circulatory polarized wave in accordance with the present invention is equipped with conductor projections 24, 26 along the inner wall of the horn antenna 22 in order to convert linearly polarized wave to circulatory polarized wave within the horn antenna 22 , without adapting the prior art generator of circulatory polarized wave. Consequently, it becomes possible to reduce the axial length and the overall size of the radiator 20 . Moreover, the conductor projections 24, 26 are constructed with their edge sections on the aperture end 30 side of the horn antenna 22 sloping down along the inner wall of the horn antenna 22 , so that generation of higher order modes can be suppressed and a satisfactory directivity can be obtained.
