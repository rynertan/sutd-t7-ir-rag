# Cathode ray tube beam deflection amplifier system.

## Abstract
A cathode ray dual mode electromagnetic beam deflec tion amplifier system for providing current for driving a deflection coil 70 , and means 40 for switching between linear and resonant non linear operational modes. In the linear mode, the deflection coil current is controlled closely to follow an applied input deflection sweep voltage and operates as a push pull amplifier. In the non linear resonant mode, one half of the output stage is abruptly decoupled from the deflection coil 70 such that energy stored in the deflection coil is discharged into a series capacitor 28 , the subsequent resonant pulse being returned through the non decoupled half of the output stage to a power supply.
