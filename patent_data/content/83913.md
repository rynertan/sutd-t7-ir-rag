# System for regulating the feed of articles to a wrapping machine.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system for regulating the feed of articles to a wrapping machine, of the type including a conveyor means 1 for feeding a series of longitudinally spaced articles 2 to the wrapping machine 3 , sensor means 8 for detecting the position of each article 2 on the conveyor means 1 at predetermined instants, and control means 13 for varying the speed of the conveyor means 1 in dependence on the output signals from the sensor means 8 , so that the articles 2 are fed to the wrapping machine 3 in a predetermined phase relation relative to it. According to the invention, the sensor means 8 are arranged to provide signals indicative of the degree of any deviation of each article 2 from the correct position in phase with the wrapping machine 3 and the control means 13 are arranged to correct the speed of the conveyor means in proportion to the degree of deviation detected.
