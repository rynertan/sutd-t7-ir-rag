# Bradykinin inhibiting tripeptide derivatives, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical preparations containing them.

## Abstract
Tripeptide derivatives of the formula H D X Phe Arg Y in which X is selected from the group consisting of Pro and Phe Y is selected from the group consisting of O R₁ and NH R₂ in which R₁ is selected from the group consisting of straight, branched and cyclic alkyl group with 1 12 C atoms, and R₂ is selected from the group consisting of H, straight, branched and cyclic alkyl group with 1 12 C atoms, and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. A process for producing said tripeptide derivatives by synthesis and purification methods which are known in the peptide chemistry. Pharamaceutical preparations comprising said tripep tide derivatives.
