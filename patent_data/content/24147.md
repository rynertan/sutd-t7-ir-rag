# Production of aromatic hydrocarbons from olefins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons suitable for use as gasoline blending compo nents. In the process a mixed hydrocarbon feedstock compris ing a C₅ C₁₂ hydrocarbon fraction containing olefins and an un saturated C₃ C₄ hydrocarbon is brought into contact in the vapour phase with an aluminosilicate having a gallium com pound deposited thereon or having gallium ions exchanged with cations therein. The resultant product shows consider able improvement in RON and MON and is therefore ideal for blending with gasoline. Hydrogen is formed as a valuable by product.
