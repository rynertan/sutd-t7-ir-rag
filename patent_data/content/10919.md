# Endless power transmission belt.

## Abstract
An endless power transmission belt has a plurality of grooves 16 formed in its inner surface and extending per pendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the belt, a cog 17 being formed between each pair of adjacent grooves 16 . At least two of the three parameters of groove pitch p in the longitudinal direction of the belt, groove depth d and cut angle a between the facing side walls of the groove are varied randomly between successive grooves in the longitudinal direction of the belt. Typically, the pitch be tween each pair of adjacent grooves is between 60 and 100 of the thickness of the belt, the depth of each groove is between 20 and 40 of the thickness of the belt, and the cut angle of each groove is between 10 and 40 .
