## Description
This invention relates to crystalline aromatic polyketones having thioether groups and a process for producing the same. More particularly, this invention relates to crystalline aromatic polyketones having a chemical structure comprising phenylene groups bonded via an ether group, a thioether group and a ketone group, or via a thioether group and a ketone group, and being excellent in heat resistance, fire retardant properties, solvent resistance, mechanical properties, thermoplastic moldability, and the like, and a process for industrially producing the same. As polymers having a structure comprising phenylene groups bonded via an ether group and a ketone group, there have been known polymers having repeating units of the formula and repeating units of the formula Since these polymers are excellent in heat resistance, molding stability and mechanical strength, they have been noticed as molding materials. But, these polymers have a defect in that their starting materials are difficult to obtain, so that there has not been known a process suitable for producing these polymers in a large scale. For example, high molecular weight aromatic polyetherketones having repeating units of the formula 2 are produced by a condensation reaction of a dihalobenzophenone and hydroquinone. In order to produce polymers having practically usable physical and chemical properties, it is necessary to use difluorobenzophenone as the dihalobenzophenone e.g. U.S. Patent No. 4,320,224 , which results in making inevitably the raw material cost high. There is also known a process for producing polyetherthioethers from an alkali metal salt of hydroxythiophenol and an aromatic dihalide such as dichlorodiphenylsulfone British Patent No. 1,295,584 , but the resulting polymer is amorphous due to an internal structure of irregular arrangement of repeating units and not always satisfactory as to heat resistance, solvent resistance and mechanical properties. There is also proposed a process for producing polyethers or polythioethers from a compound having two XH groups wherein X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom and a dihalobenzenoid compound in the presence of potassium carbonate British Patent No. 1,264,900 . But the polymerization temperature is low and no crystalline polymer is obtained according to this process like the above mentioned case. On the other hand, as polymers having a structure comprising phenylene groups bonded via a thioether group, there have been known a polyphenylenesulfide having repeating units of the formula obtained by reacting, for example, dichlorobenzene and sodium sulfide U.S. Patent No. 3,919,177 . This polyphenylenesulfide has excellent properties such as excellent in fire retardant properties, low in moisture absorption properties, high in dimensional stability, good in afinity to an inorganic filler and high in mixing concentration of the filler. But since this polyphenylenesulfide has a glass transition temperature Tg of as low as 80 C, the heat distortion temperature HDT is low when no glass fiber is filled and thus there is a problem in heat resistance. Further, since the crystalline melting point Tm of this polymer is relatively low as 281 C, the application field of this polymer as a heat resistant polymer is forced to be limited. Therefore, the development of these kinds of polymers having a higher crystalline melting point have been desired. In order to make the melting point of these kinds of polymers higher, there have been proposed various processes. For example, it is proposed to introduce units of the formula or between linkages of U.S. Patent No. 4,286,018 . But the resulting polymer has a defect in that the crystalinity is lowered to deteriorate heat resistance and mechanical properties compared with the homopolymer, when the content of the unit of the formula is 90 by mole or less. As polymers obtained by regularly introducing ketone groups into polyphenylenesulfides, it is known polymers having repeating units of the formula and repeating units of the formula But the polymer having the repeating units of the formula 4 melts at 220 to 230 C U.S. Patent No. 3,432,468 and is insufficient in heat resistance. On the other hand, the polymer having the repeating units of the formula 5 has the Tm as high as 352 C, but there is a problem in that the resulting film is brittle British Patent No. 1,368,967 . As mentioned above, polymers having improved heat resistance by enhancing Tg and Tm without losing excellent properties of polyphenylenesulfides have not been found. These polymers such as those having repeating units of the formula 4 are generally obtained by reacting dipotassium salt of 4,4 disulfhydryldiphenylsulfide and 4,4 dibromobenzophenone at a temperature of 130 to 150 C. But under such low temperature polymerization conditions, since a low molecular weight polymer is deposited at an initial stage of the polymerization, it is very difficult to obtain the desired highly crystalline high molecular weight polymer. Further, such a process has another defect of using a raw material very difficult to obtain. In the case of polymers having repeating units of the formula 5 , 4 chloro 4 mercaptobenzophenone which is very difficult to obtain is used as a raw material. On the other hand, there is also known a process for producing these crystalline aromatic polyketones by Friedel Crafts polymerization. In such a case, when the polymerization is carried out in a conventional organic solvent, polymers having a low molecular weight can only be obtained. For example, diphenyl ether and terephthaloyl chloride are polymerized in a solvent of nitrobenzene using aluminum trichloride as a catalyst to give a low molecular weight polymer having an inherent viscosity of 0.13 U.S. Patent No. 3,065,205 . But the use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as a solvent makes it possible to give a polymer having a high inherent viscosity for the first time. That is, a high molecular weight crystalline polyketone is obtained by using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as a solvent and boron trifluoride as a catalyst U.S. Patent No. 3,442,857 . In addition, the crystalline aromatic polyketones having the repeating units of the formula 1 produced by Friedel Crafts polymerization are lower in modulus at a temperature of about 200 C to about 350 C and smaller in both the heat of crystallization and heat of fusion than the polymers having repeating units of the formula 1 polymerized by polycondensation with nucleophilic substitution. Further, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra show that the polymer obtained by Friedel Crafts polymerization has spectra due to ortho and or meta position arrangement in addition to paraposition arrangement. Therefore, the polymer obtained by Friedel Crafts polymerization is low in crystallinity due to different structure of ortho and or meta substitution and is lowered in the modulus Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 155228 85 . The same characteristics can be seen in aromatic polysulfones obtained by Friedel Crafts polymerization. That is, in the polymer obtained from diphenyl ether and 4,4 bis chlorosulfonyl diphenyl ether, about 20 of ortho orientation that is, different bonding is present Polymer As mentioned above, it is very difficult to obtain polymers having uniform structure, a high melting point and high crystallinity by the Friedel Crafts polymerization. On the other hand, there has been known no process for producing crystalline aromatic polythioetherketones by using easily available raw materials and simple process steps, and even if crystalline aromatic polythioetherketones are produced, they cannot be used practically as a beat resistant polymer material owing to their low molecular weights. Aromatic polythioethers having repeating thioether groups and which may comprise aromatic ketone groups, for example polymers having repeating units of the structure are known from GB A 1 124 200. These polymers have good solutilities in organic solvents, such as chloroform and methylene chloride. DE B 20 09 323 discloses a process for producing amorphous aromatic copolythioethers which have good solubility in organic solvents. These copolymers are produced by reacting an aromatic dihalogenated compound with an aromatic dithiol in a polar aprotic solvent in which the copolythioether produced is soluble. It is essential in this process that at least one of the two reactants comprises at least two species. The resulting products are solvent soluble and according to the examples amorphous products. It is an object of this invention to provide a crystalline, high molecular weight, linear polymer substantially having repeating units of the formulae and or and repeating units of the formulae and or alternately, with excellent heat resistance, while retaining excellent properties of thioether groups such as fire retardant properties, low moisture absorption properties, dimensional stability, good affinity to inorganic fillers. It is another object of this invention to provide a process for producing such a crystalline linear polymer by using readily available raw materials with simple procedures. This invention provides a crystalline aromatic polyketone having a linear polymer structure consisting of repeating units I of the formulae and or and repeating units II of the formulae and or said repeating unit I and said repeating unit II being bonded alternately, and said polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.4 or more and being insoluble in a solvent selected from methylene chloride, chloroform, N,N dimethylformamide, sulfolane, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphorictriamide, hexane or toluene at room temperature. This invention also provides a process for producing the crystalline aromatic polyketone mentioned above comprising polycondensing a 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone and 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene in the presence of an alkali, or polycondensing a 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone and an alkali metal salt of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or an alkali metal salt of p dimercaptobenzene, using an aromatic ketone or an aromatic sulfone as a solvent. Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 18 are X ray diffraction charts of polymers obtained in Examples of this invention Figs. 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, 15, 17 and 19 are infrared spectra of polymers obtained in Examples of this invention and Fig. 9 is a ¹³C NMR chart of the polymer in solid state obtained in Example 10 of this invention The crystalline aromatic polyketones of this invention are polymers and copolymers having a linear polymer structure comprising repeating units I of the formulae and or and repeating units II of the formulae and or said repeating unit I and said repeating unit II being bonded alternately. Compounds which can constitute the repeating unit of the formula Ia are, for example, those having as substituents halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and a nitro group at the 4 and 4 positions of terephthalophenone as groups to be eliminated. Compounds which can constitute the repeating unit of the formula Ib are, for example, those having as substituents the same groups to be eliminated as mentioned above at the 4 and 4 positions of benzophenone. Compounds which can constitute the repeating unit of the formula IIa are, for example, 4 hydroxythiophenol, an alkali metal salt thereof, a 4 trialkylsiloxy 4 trialkylthiosiloxybenzene, etc. Compounds which can constitute the repeating unit of the formula IIb are, for example, p dimercaptobenzene, an alkali metal salt thereof, a p bis trialkylthiosiloxy benzene, etc. The compounds mentioned above for constituting individual repeating units are not limitative, and any compounds which can form the repeating units in the polymer as a result of reactions can be used in this invention. Concrete examples of the polymer in this invention are as follows Concrete examples of the copolymer in this invention are as follows In the case of the polymers A and C and the copolymer E wherein the repeating unit IIa is included, there can be formed the following two units based on the bonding form for the repeating unit I wherein n and n are zero or an integer of 1, wherein m and m are zero or an integer of 1. The polymer can include either only one or both of the above mentioned units. As to the melting point, the polymer including the former units preferentially has in general a higher melting point, but as to the crystallinity, the difference between the polymer including only one kind of unit and the polymer including both kinds of units is small. In the case of the copolymers G , H and J , the distribution of the repeating units IIa and IIb alternately bonded to the repeating bits I Ia or Ib or both Ia and Ib can be present in the polymers in random, block and alternating. In the case of the copolymers E , F and J , the distribution of the repeating units Ia and Ib alternately bonded to the repeating units II IIa or IIb or both IIa and IIb can be present in the polymers in random, block and alternating. The polymers of this invention, irrespective of polymers and copolymers , are crystalline. Generally speaking, in the case of copolymerization of monomers which can produce crystalline polymers when polymerized alone, the resulting copolymer becomes amorphous in some range of composition. But, it is a very surprising thing in this invention that all the polymers and copolymers are crystalline irrespective of their composition. Among the polymers A , B , C and D , the polymers B , D and A in the case of A , including all the bonding form of the repeating units IIa to the repeating units Ia are higher in the degree of crystallinity, and the polymers A and B are particularly high in the degree of crystallinity. Among the copolymers E , F , G , H and J , the copolymers G , F and E are higher in the degree of crystallinity, and the copolymers G and F are particularly high in the degree of crystallinity. Particularly preferable ones with high degree of crystallinity are the copolymer F having Ia in an amount of 40 mole or more, and the copolymer G having IIa in an amount of 70 mole or more or 40 mole or less together with high crystallization rate . In the case of the copolymer E , the degree of crystallinity becomes high with an increase of the content of Ia in the repeating units I . A preferable one is that having Ia in an amount of 50 mole or more and belonging to Group I because of higher degree of crystallinity. In the case of the copolymer H , the degree of crystallinity is high when the molar ratio of IIa to IIb in the repeating units II is 35 65 or less and 65 35 or more. As to the crystalline melting point, the polymers A and B and the copolymer G including the repeating units Ia and the repeating units II are higher than the polymers C and D and the copolymer H including the repeating units Ib and copolymer H including the repeating units Ib and the repeating units II . In the copolymers E and F , there is a tendency to increase the crystalline melting point with an increase of the content of Ia in the repeating units I . In the case of copolymers G and H , the change of crystalline melting point depending on the contents of IIa and IIb in the repeating units II is small. As mentioned above, it is possible in this invention to produce the polymers and copolymers having the desired degree of crystallinity and the desired crystalline melting point by variously combining the repeating units I and the repeating units II . In case of usual polymers the melting points are lowered when the molecular weight is not sufficiently high or a branched structure is present. But in this invention, the polymers and the copolymers are linear and have high molecular weight, so that the melting point is 330 C or more in the case of polymer B , and 280 C or more in the case of the polymer D . The polymers and copolymers of this invention should have an intrinsic viscosity of 0.4 or more, preferably 0.4 to 1.8. When the intrinsic viscosity is less than 0.4, the polymers and copolymers become brittle and are not suitable for films and injection molded articles. On the other hand, when the intrinsic viscosity is more than 1.8, there is a tendency that the viscosity of molten polymers and copolymers increases excessively, which results in making it difficult to mold them. The polymers A and C and copolymer E are slow in the crystallization rate, so that they are advantageous for producing film. On the other hand, the polymers B and D and copolymer F are fast in the crystallization rate, so that they are suitable for injection molding. Articles obtained from the polymers and copolymers of this invention are excellent in heat resistance. The heat resistance can be evaluated by the weight loss by heating. The temperature necessary for losing 5 by weight in air is 50 to 70 C higher than that of known polyphenylenesulfides. Among the polymers of this invention, the polymer A shows a higher value than the polymers B , C and D . The polymers and copolymers of this invention are superior in fire retardant properties to known aromatic polyetherketones as shown in Example 33 mentioned below, and equal to or superior to known polyphenylenesulfides having excellent fire retardant properties. The polymers B and D and copolymer F are slightly better than the polymers A and C and copolymer E regarding the fire retardant properties. It is also characteristic that the polymers and copolymers of this invention are good in flow properties. For example, the polymer A shows more excellent flow properties compared with known aromatic polyetherketones having almost the same intrinsic viscosity. This means that the polymers and copolymers of this invention have advantages of lowering the molding pressure and the molding temperature at the time of practical molding. In other words, the polymers and copolymers of this invention can have higher molecular weight at the same level of flow properties, which results in making it possible to improve in mechanical properties such as impact strength, and the like. X ray diffraction measurement shows that the polymers and copolymers of this invention can be divided into two groups depending on patterns of X ray diffraction charts, when the values of 2ϑ from the first to third intensities of the diffraction chart are taken into consideration. Group 1 includes the polymers A , B , D and copolymers G , F , H wherein the ratio of IIb in the repeating units II is predominant and E wherein the ratio of Ia in the repeating units I is predominant . Group 2 includes the polymer C and the copolymers H wherein the ratio of IIb in the repeating units II is minor and E wherein the ratio of Ib in the repeating units I is major . Some of the copolymers H and E show peaks characteristic to both of the groups 1 and 2. In contrast, the X ray diffraction pattern of known aromatic polyetherketones belongs to the group 2. Therefore, the X ray diffraction pattern of group 1 is characteristic to the aromatic polyketones containing thioether groups. Correspondence of these X ray diffraction patterns and properties of the polymers and copolymers of this invention is not clear, but the correspondence of the portions belonging to the group 1 to the portions high in the degree of crystallinity seems to be good. The crystalline aromatic polyketones of this invention can be produced by polycondensation of monomers corresponding to the repeating units I and II in the presence of an alkali using an aromatic ketone or an aromatic sulfone as a solvent. As the monomers, there can be used 4 hydroxythiophenol or an alkali metal Na, K, Li, etc. salt thereof, p dimercaptobenzene or an alkali metal salt thereof, 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone of the formula wherein X¹ and X² are, different or the same, halogen atoms, or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone of the formula wherein X¹ and X² are as defined above. The alkali metal salts of 4 hydroxythiophenol and p dimercaptobenzene can be obtained by a conventional process, for example, by reacting an alkali metal hydroxide with 4 hydroxythiophenol or p dimercaptobenzene. Examples of the 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone are 4,4 dichloroterephthalophenone, 4,4 difluoroterephthalophenone, 4 chloro 4 fluoroterephthalophenone, and the like. These compounds can be used alone or as a mixture thereof. Examples of the 4,4 dihalobenzophenone are 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone, 4,4 difluorobenzophenone, 4 chloro 4 fluorobenzophenone, and the like. These compounds can be used alone or as a mixture thereof. In this invention, it is not necessary to use fluorine compounds which are usually difficult to obtain, as the starting materials. Even if compounds wherein both X¹ and X² are chlorine in the formulae 6 and 7 which are easy to obtain are used, polymers having a high molecular weight can be obtained by a polymerization time not so different from the case of using the fluorine compound. There is no special difference in heat resistance generally required, even if polymers or copolymers are obtained by using a monomer wherein both X¹ and X² are chlorine or wherein both X¹ and X² are fluorine. But when heat resistance for a long period of time under severe conditions is required, the use of a polymer obtained by using a fluorine compound is preferable due to better heat resistance attained. The 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone and 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene are preferably used in substantially equimolar, and more concretely 0.95 to 1.20 moles of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene per mole of 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone. When the monomers are used outside the above mentioned range, it is difficult to obtain the desired high molecular weight polymers and copolymers. Particularly when p dimercaptobenzene is used, it is preferably be used in slight excess, such as 1.01 to 1.15 moles to give a polymer having a high molecular weight. But, in this case, in order to reduce the amount of thermally unstable terminal mercapto groups, it is preferable to replace the terminal mercapto groups by thermally stable alkyl, aromatic halogen or aromatic groups. In the case of using 4 hydroxythlophenol, it is preferable to use it in 0.95 to 1.00 mole in order to make the terminal groups thermally stable aromatic halide units. As the solvent for the polycondensation, there is used an aromatic ketone or aromatic sulfone. As the aromatic ketone, there can be used benzophenone compounds of the formula where R¹ and R² are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group, provided that when R¹ or R² is a phenyl group, the phenyl group can be fused with a benzene ring of the benzophenone skelton. Examples of the benzophenone compound of the formula 8 are benzophenone, 4 methylbenzophenone, 4 phenylbenzophenone, naphthylphenylketone, 4,4 dimethylbenzophenone, etc. Among them, the use of benzophenone is preferable from the viewpoint of thermal stability and easiness of availability. It is possible to use as the aromatic ketone xanthone compounds and thioxanthone compounds of the formula wherein R³ and R⁴ are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group and Y is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom. Examples of the xanthone and thioxanthone compounds of the formula 9 are xanthone, 2 methylxanthone, 2 phenylxanthone, thioxanthone, 2 methylthioxanthone, 2 phenylthioxanthone, etc. Among them, xanthone and thioxanthone are preferable. In addition, 4 phenoxybenzophenone, terephthalophenone, isophthalophenone, etc., can also be used as the aromatic ketone. As the aromatic sulfone, there can be used those represented by the formulae wherein R⁵ and R⁶ are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a phenyl group. Examples of the aromatic sulfone are diphenylsulfone, ditolylsulfone, dibenzothiophene oxide, phenoxanthine dioxide, 4 phenylsulfonylbiphenyl, etc. Among these solvents, the use of aromatic ketones is preferable in order to obtain highly crystalline polymers having a high molecular weight and thermal stability compared with aromatic sulfones. The reason seems to be that the aromatic ketones are excellent in solubility for the polymer or copolymer produced. Further, the aromatic ketones have no oxidizing properties as is clear from the structure, so that there is no fear of oxidizing monomers of thiophenols and thus a polymer having an ununiform structure such as branching is scarcely produced. Particularly when highly oxidizable p dimercaptobenzene is used in a larger proportion, the use of an aromatic ketone as the solvent is preferable. Among the aromatic ketones, benzophenone m.p. 48 to 49 C can be treated as a liquid near normal temperatures compared with solvents which are solid at near normal temperature such as xanthone m.p. 173 to 174 C and thioxanthone m.p. 207 to 209 C , and allows easy separation of the product, recovery and refining of the solvent, so that the use of benzophenone is preferable. The solvent is usually used in an amount of preferably 10 to 1000 parts by weight, more preferably 20 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total of the monomers, that is, 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene and 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone. The use of too much solvent is not preferable from the viewpoint of polycondensation efficiency and the use of too less solvent is not preferable from the viewpoint of not exhibiting effects of the solvent. The polycondensation reaction can be carried out, for example, by using substantially equimolar amounts of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene and 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone in a suitable solvent in the presence of an alkali with heating, or alternatively by heating substantially equimolar amounts of alkali metal salt s of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene and 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone in a suitable solvent. Since 4 hydroxythiophenol having a free hydroxyl group and a mercapto group is more stable than its alkali metal salt, and p dimercaptobenzene having free mercapto groups is more stable and more simple in polymerization operation than its alkali metal salt, the polycondensation using the stabler compounds in the presence of an alkali is preferable. As the alkali, there can be used hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, fluorides, hydrides, alkoxides and alkylated compounds of alkali metals. Among them, preferable ones are alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal bicarbonates. Preferable examples are sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, rubidium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, rubidium bicarbonate, cesium bicarbonate, and the like. Among them, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate are more preferable. These alkalis may be used alone or as a mixture thereof. The amount of the alkali metal salt used as the alkali is preferably 0.3 to 2 gram atoms in terms of the alkali metal atom per 0.5 mole of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene. The use of too much alkali metal salt is disadvantageous since it causes a too vigorous reaction and harmful side reactions, and in cost, therefore the use of alkali metal salt in an amount as small as possible is preferable. But an amount of alkali metal salt of less than 0.3 gram atom is not preferable because of the need of a longer polymerization time and difficulty in obtaining a polymer having a desirable molecular weight. In the case of using a xanthone compound or a thioxanthone compound as the solvent, the use of alkali metal salt in an amount of 0.5 to 1.2 gram atom per 0.5 mole of 4 hydrorythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene is more preferable. In the case of using a benzophenone compound as the solvent, the use of alkali metal salt in an amount of 0.7 to 1.2 gram atom per 0.5 mole of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene is more preferable. The alkali metal salt used as the alkali is preferably in the form of an anhydrous salt, but the use of a hydrated salt becomes possible by removing the water by distillation together with an azeotropic solvent from the polymerization reaction system. The process of this invention can be carried out as follows. In the case of using an alkali, a solvent, an alkali, a 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or a 4,4 dihalobenzophenone, and 4 hydroxythiophenol and or p dimercaptobenzene are placed in a reactor preferably under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or the like. In the case of using no alkali, a solvent, 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and or 4,4 dihalobenzophenone, and an alkali metal salt of 4 hydroxythiophenol and or an alkali metal salt of p dimercaptobenzene are placed in a reactor preferably under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or the like. Then, the reaction mixture is heated at 200 to 400 C, preferably at 250 to 350 C, preferably under an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or the like, to carry out the polymerization reaction. When the reaction temperature is lower than 200 C, a polymer is deposited during the polymerization and no polymer having a high molecular weight can be obtained, while when the reaction temperature is higher than 400 C, coloring of the produced polymer due to deterioration becomes remarkable. Further, rapid temperature rise is not preferable because of causing side reactions, coloring of the produced polymer, gelation, and the like. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the reaction temperature stepwise or gradually and to maintain the temperature in the polymerization system as uniform as possible. In order to obtain high molecular weight polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.4 or more, it is necessary to make the polymerization temperature 200 C or higher at the final stage. In order to carry out the polycondensation smoothly, it is possible to carry out a pre polymerization at a temperature lower than 200 C. It is preferable to remove the water produced during the polymerization from the system. As the water removing process, there can be used a process of replacing the gas phase of the polymerization system simply by a dry inert gas, a process of introducing a solvent having a lower boiling point than the polymerization solvent into the system and removing by distillation the water together with the lower boiling point solvent from the system, and the like. The polymerization reaction can be stopped by adding to the reaction system a suitable terminator at the above mentioned polymerization temperature. As the terminator, there can be used monofunctional or polyfunctional halogenides such as methyl chloride, tert butyl chloride, 4,4 dichlorodiphenylsulfone, 4,4 difluorobenzophenone, 4,4 difluoroterephthalophenone, 4 fluorobenzophenone, etc. Further, by this termination, there can be obtained polymers and copolymers having thermally stable alkyl groups, aromatic halogen groups, aromatic groups, or the like, at the terminals. The thus obtained polymers and copolymers of this invention have substantially the repeating units I of the formula and or and the repeating units II of the formulae and or bonded alternately. For example, the crystalline polymers and copolymers of this invention can have repeating units of the formula wherein n is zero or an integer of 1 X and Y are independently oxygen or sulfur, provided that when X is sulfur, Y is oxygen or sulfur, while when X is oxygen, Y is sulfur. The crystalline polymers and copolymers of this invention have a melting point of about 270 to 380 C and a high degree of crystallinity. Among these repeating units, the repeating unit IIa can form a repeating unit of the formula wherein n and n are independently zero or an integer of 1, or the formula wherein m and m are independently zero or an integer of 1, depending on the bonding forms for the repeating units I . In this invention, the polymers and copolymers can contain either one of the repeating units 13 and 14 or both of them randomly or regularly. Among them, copolymers having a structure of high crystalline melting point are preferable due to high degree of crystallinity. When no particular control is given to the polymerization system, a random structure having no regularity in the bonding form seems to be produced preferentially. But since the reactivity of the mercapto group is considerably higher than the hydroxyl group at low temperatures, when the polymerization is carried out at a high temperature after previous prepolymerization at a lower temperature, the repeating unit of the formula 13 is preferentially formed. On the other hand, when 1 mole of 4 hydroxythiophenol is reacted with 0.5 mole of an aromatic dihalide, followed by the reaction with 0.5 mole of the residual aromatic dihalide, the repeating unit of the formula 14 is preferentially formed. As mentioned above, when the repeating units I comprises Ia and Ib , random, alternating and block bonding states in the resulting copolymers may be present depending on the distribution state of the repeating units of the formulae Ia and Ib . Such distribution states can be controlled by the adding methods of 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone and 4,4 dihalobenzophenone. For example, when equimolar amounts of 4 hydroxythiophenol or p dimercaptobenzene and a mixture of the above mentioned aromatic dihalides are charged into the reaction system at the same time and polymerized, copolymers having a random distribution of the repeating units Ia and the repeating units Ib can be obtained. On the other hand, when equimolar amounts of 4 hydroxythiophenol or p dimercaptobenzene and 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone are reacted, followed by the reaction of equimolar amounts of 4 hydroxythiophenol or p dimercaptobenzene and 4,4 dihalobenzophenone, copolymers having a block distribution of the repeating units Ia and Ib can be obtained. When 2 moles of 4 hydroxythiophenol or p dimercaptobenzene and 1 mole of 4,4 dihaloterephthalophenone are reacted, followed by the reaction with 1 mole of 4,4 dihalobenzophenone, copolymers having highly alternating repeating units of Ia and Ib can be obtained. When the repeating units II comprises IIa and IIb , random, alternating and block bonding states in the resulting copolymers are also present depending on the distribution state of the repeating units of the formulae IIa and IIb . As mentioned above, various polymers and copolymers having regularity or irregularity, and those having the desired high melting point and high degree of crystallinity can be produced by changing the combination of monomers, the polymerization temperature and the adding method of monomers. Among them, those having relatively high regularity and high crystallinity are preferable. The polymers and copolymers of this invention have more excellent properties than the conventional polyphenylenesulfides and are remarkably enhanced in heat resistance. For example, polymers having repeating units of the formula or or copolymers containing these repeating units are crystalline thermoplastic resins having a high melting point, e.g. a Tg enhanced by 54 to 73 C and a Tm enhanced by 22 to 88 C, and properties such as excellent heat resistance and fire retardant properties, high dimensional stability, low moisture absorption, good affinity to an inorganic filler, excellent in mechanical properties, and remarkably excellent solvent resistance since they are hardly dissolved in almost all solvents at room temperature except for concentrated sulfuric acid. The crystalline aromatic polyketone polymers and copolymers having thioether groups of this invention are suitably used as molding materials for producing articles used under severe conditions at high temperatures. Further, the polymers and copolymers of this invention have other advantages in that they have more excellent in fire retardant properties and moldability than conventional aromatic polyetherketones and they are obtained by using non expensive aromatic dihalo compounds as starting materials. In addition, by controlling the bonding arrangement of the repeating units Ia and Ib as well as IIa and IIb , polymers and copolymers having various compositions and regularity can be produced, so that polymers and copolymers having different glass transition temperatures, crystalline melting points, and crystallization rates can be obtained depending on the respective purpose. The polymers and copolymers of this invention can be used as shaped articles, coatings, films, fibers as they are, and also used together with one or more engineering plastics, heat resistant resins, glass fibers, carbon fibers, inorganic materials and the like, for providing alloys and composite materials. This invention is illustrated by way of the following Examples. In this invention, since the polymers and copolymers are dissolved in only concentrated sulfuric acid and not dissolved in general organic solvents, it is difficult to measure an average molecular weight. Therefore, the intrinsic viscosity is used as a measure of the molecular weight. In the following Examples, properties of the polymers and copolymers were measured as follows. Using concentrated sulfuric acid having a density of 1.84 g cm³, a solution containing 0.1 g of a polymer per 100 cm³ of the solution and a solution containing 0.5 g of a polymer per 100 cm³ of the solution were prepared. Viscosities of the solutions were measured at 25 C and the intrinsic viscosity was obtained by using the following equation Tm and Tg were measured by using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC with a temperature rise rate of 10 C min. For measuring the Tm, a polymer powder obtained by the polymerization was used as it was.

After adding 5.52 g 0.040 mole of anhydrous potassium carbonate at 120 C, the temperature was raised to 305 C in one hour and maintained at that temperature for 3 hours to give a viscous reaction solution. The reaction was carried out from the beginning under an atmospheric pressure. Subsequently, 4.0 g of 4,4 difluoroterephthalophenone was added at that temperature, which temperature was maintained for 30 minutes. The reaction solution was cooled and a solid product was separated, pulverized and washed with warm acetone twice, warm water twice and warm acetone once to give a polymer in 96 yield. This polymer was crystalline and had an intrinsic viscosity of 1.10, Tm of 355 C and Tg of 152 C. The polymer had an alternating structure of the repeating units of the formulae and The polymer was made into a film by using a press at 400 C and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes. The film had an intrinsic viscosity of 1.10, which value was not changed. This means that the polymer is very stable thermally.
