# High pressure discharge lamp with thermal switch.

## Abstract
An electric discharge lamp 5 has an arc tube within an outer gas filled glass envelope 7 , and a thermal switching means is located within the outer envelope. The thermal switching means 47 has a bimetal strip 49 and a spring like member 51 each affixed to at least one of the electrical conductors, and upon application of heat the bimetal strip 49 and spring like member 51 are flexed to short circuit the electrical conductors and remove any DC potential between the main electrode 21 and the starting electrode 25 minimizing electrolysis.
