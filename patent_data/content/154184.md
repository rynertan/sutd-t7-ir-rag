# Process for the preparation of homogeneous metal oxide varistors.

## Abstract
A process for making a homogeneous metal oxide varistor powder is described. The ingredients desired in a varistor are water and acid soluble and dissolved in water and acid respectively to make a solution. The remaining ingredients which are water and acid insoluble are then suspended in the solution to make a homogeneous slurry. The slurry is dried, calcined, reslurried, dried, pressed and sintered. The sintered body has electrical leads attached then encapsulated in an epoxy resin to make an encapsulated varistor package.
