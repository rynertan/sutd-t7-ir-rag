# Method for making electrodes for double layer capacitors.

## Abstract
A method of making electrodes 13 for use in double layer capacitors 10 comprising adding to a carbon powder electrolyte mix an excess of liquid to render the mix pumpable, moderately overfilling an electrode cavity 17 with the mix and removing the excess liquid in an equilibration step so that the remaining mix substantially fills the electrode cavity 17 .
