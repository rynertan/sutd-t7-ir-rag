# Call progress tone detection circuit.

## Abstract
A call progress tone detection circuit for an automated telephone equipment extracts the low frequency envelope 112 of the unknown signal and examines its period. These period measurements are accumulated 118 and then valuated. If the envelope period is not reasonably constant over a standard measurement interval, then the call progress tone detection circuit 117 can conclude that the unknown signal is voice. However, if the envelope period is regular, then the call progress tone detection circuit 117 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention will compare the detected envelope period and other timing parameters of the signal to known periods and correspond ing parameters for signals used by the various telephone systems in current use. If there is a match between the detected parameters, then the call progress tone detection circuit 117 identifies the call progress tone for further use by the automatic telephone caller.
