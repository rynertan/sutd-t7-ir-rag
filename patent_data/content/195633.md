## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit having load drive characteristics. Generally, a previously proposed semiconductor integrated circuit used as an analog buffer amplifier comprises a differential stage and an output stage, and an input signal having a voltage level V When the input signal level V However, in the above mentioned analog buffer amplifier, the output voltage V Therefore, a capacitor is provided in the output stage to correct the phase of the output voltage V As a result, a large area in the semiconductor integrated circuit is occupied by the capacitor, and thus a problem arises in that the total area needed for the layout of the semiconductor integrated circuit tends to increase. In this connection, if the capacitor is small size, the range of the load which can be driven by the analog buffer amplifier is limited. Further, in the above semiconductor integrated circuit, a constant current flows through constant current sources provided in the differential stage and the output stage, irrespective of the value of the load driven by the analog buffer amplifier. Particularly, in the constant current source provided in the output stage, it is necessary to determine the value of the constant current flowing through the constant current source by taking into consideration the value of the constant current flowing when the maximum load is driven. As a result, another problem arises in that the constant current value is always equal to the value needed when the maximum load is driven, and thus power is wasted. An article by A. A. A. Ahmed entitled Zero Offset Potential Follower Circuits in RCA Technical Notes, No. 938, 17th September 1973, pages 1 7, RCA, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A., discloses a current mirror circuit used in a differential amplifier configuration in order to control the currents flowing through first and second bipolar transistors connected to input and output terminals respectively. According to the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising An embodiment of the present invention may provide an analog buffer amplifier constructed without the provision of a feed back circuit, and thus reducing the total area needed for the layout of the semiconductor integrated circuit by omitting the capacitor for correcting the phase. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a low power analog buffer amplifier able to regulate the total current supplied from a power supply source in accordance with a value of a load driven by the analog buffer amplifier, thus reducing the consumption of power. An embodiment of the present invention may increase an input impedance of the analog buffer amplifier in a usual mode and reduce a drive ability required for driving the analog buffer amplifier. Another embodiment of the present invention may provide a constant current output circuit by utilizing the above analog buffer amplifier, and may provide a constant current output circuit having the same advantages as those of the above analog buffer amplifier, and able to output a predetermined constant current with a high accuracy and high stability in accordance with a resistance value of a variable resistor connected from outside of a chip to a predetermined terminal of the circuit. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising an analog buffer amplifier able to output a predetermined voltage level in accordance with an input signal voltage level irrespective of a value of a load, without consuming high power and may also provide a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising a constant current output circuit utilizing the above analog buffer amplifier, able to output a predetermined constant current in accordance with a constant input signal voltage level and a resistance value of a variable resistor connected from outside of a chip to a predetermined terminal of the circuit. In one embodiment of the present invention, the semiconductor integrated circuit operates so that the output voltage level obtained from the source or the emitter of the second transistor is determined in accordance with the value of the input signal voltage level supplied to the source or the emitter of the first transistor, and the current mirror circuit makes the value of the first current proportional to the value of the second current namely, the load current , and thus the voltage level supplied to the gates or bases of the first and second transistors is varied in accordance with the value of the second current so as to supply enough current from the power supply source to drive the load. In another embodiment of the present invention, the semiconductor integrated circuit operates so that the constant output voltage level D.C. voltage level is obtained from the source or the emitter of the second transistor in accordance with the value of the predetermined constant input signal voltage level D.C. voltage level supplied to the source or the emitter of the first transistor, and the current mirror circuit makes the value of the first current proportional to the value of the second current namely, the current flowing through the variable resistor , and thus the voltage level supplied to the gates or bases of the first and second transistors is varied in accordance with the value of the second current and the predetermined constant current is output from the output terminal provided in the current mirror circuit in accordance with the value of the second current. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which To clarify the background of the present invention, an example of a previously proposed semiconductor integrated circuit used as an analog buffer amplifier is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the analog buffer amplifier comprises a differential stage 1 and an output stage 2. The differential stage 1 comprises a pair of p channel type transistors T₁₁ and T₁₂ having gates connected to a drain of the transistor T₁₁ , a pair of N channel type transistors T₁₃ and T₁₄ having sources connected in common, and a constant current source 15 connected between the sources of the transistors T₁₃ and T₁₄ and earth potential. The output stage 2 comprises a P channel type transistor T₁₆ and a constant current source 17 connected between a drain of the transistor T₁₆ and the earth potential. An input signal having a voltage level V Thus, if the input signal level V However, as above mentioned, in the above analog buffer amplifier, the output voltage V Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, a capacitor C is connected between the gate and drain of the transistor T₁₆ , to correct the phase of the output voltage V Further, in the previously proposed semiconductor integrated circuit, a constant current flows through the constant current sources, irrespective of the value of the load driven by the analog buffer amplifier. Particularly, in the constant current source 17 provided in the output stage 2, it is necessary to determine the value of the constant current flowing through the constant current source by taking into consideration the value of the constant current flowing when the maximum load is driven. As a result, another problem arises in that the constant current value becomes always equal to the value needed when the maximum load is driven, and thus power is wasted. Figure 2 shows a circuit diagram illustrating a first embodiment of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the present invention, by which these problems may be solved. As shown in Fig. 2, the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the first embodiment of the present invention comprises a pair of N channel type transistors T₅ and T₈ having gates connected to a drain of the transistor T₅ , and an input terminal IN is connected to a source of the transistor T₅. Thus, each gate voltage of the transistors T₅ and T₈ becomes almost equal to V As a result, the output voltage level V Thus, if it is assumed that the load current increases in accordance with the variation of the input signal level V Further the circuit shown in Fig. 2, comprises a current mirror circuit 3 including the transistor T₇ and two transistors T₄ and T₁ all of these transistors T₇ , T₄ , and T₁ are P channel type transistors having gates connected to a drain of the transistor T₇ , and a current having a value proportional to the load current flowing through the transistor T₇ flows through each of the transistors T₄ and T₁. In this connection, the ratio between each current value flowing through each of these transistors T₇ , T₄ , and T₁ is determined by the ratio between the size namely, each current amplification factor β of each of these transistors T₇ , T₄ , and T₁. Thus, when the load current increases, the gate voltage of each of these transistors T₇ , T₄, and T₁ constructing the current mirror circuit 3 namely, a drain voltage of the transistor T₈ falls, and thee current flowing through the P channel transistor T₄ increases. As a result, a drain voltage of the transistors T₄ and T₅ namely, the gate voltage of each pair of transistors T₅ and T₈ rises. Thus, the gate voltage of each of the N channel transistors T₅ and T₈ rises in accordance with the increased load current, and is regulated so as to compensate for the insufficiency of the gate bias voltage. As mentioned above, if the value of the load current increases in accordance with the input signal level V Also, the current flowing through the transistor T₁ constructing the current mirror circuit 3 becomes equal to the current flowing through the transistor T₄ if it is assumed that the sizes namely, each current amplification factor of each of the transistors T₁ and T₄ are equal , and this equal current flows through the N channel transistors T₂ and T₃. In this connection, the circuit shown in Fig. 2 also comprises another current mirror circuit 4 including the transistor T₃ and a transistor T₆ both transistors are N channel type transistors , and the value of the current flowing through the transistor T₆ becomes equal to that flowing through the transistor T₃ , if it is assumed that the sizes namely, each current amplification factor of each of these transistors T₃ and T₆ are equal. As a result, almost all of the current flowing through the transistors T₄ and T₅ toward the source of the transistor T₅ namely, toward or from the input terminal flows into the transistor T₆. In other words, the value of the current flowing into the input terminal IN or flowing out of the input terminal IN becomes almost zero in a usual mode, and thus it is possible to remarkably increase the input impedance of the analog buffer amplifier circuit in a usual mode and to reduce the drive ability needed of the system provided for driving the analog buffer amplifier. In this connection, although it is not always necessary to provide the transistor T₂ connected in series to the transistor T₁ , the circuit shown in Fig. 2 is provided with the transistor T₂ to ensure a balance in each circuit which is provided with each of the transistors T₅ and T₂ , and thus it is possible to obtain a highly accurate circuit. As above mentioned, it is possible to regulate the value of the current supplied from the power supply source in accordance with the value of the load current, and to obtain a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising a low power analog buffer amplifier which does not waste power. Figure 3 shows a circuit diagram illustrating a second embodiment of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the present invention, which comprises a constant current output circuit utilizing the above analog buffer amplifier. In Fig. 3, members identical to those of Fig. 2 are represented by the same reference numerals or characters as in all later figures. As shown in Fig. 3, the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the second embodiment of the present invention, comprises a pair of N channel transistors T₅ and T₈ having gates connected to a drain of the transistor T₅ , and a predetermined constant reference voltage V Further, the circuit shown in Fig. 3, comprises a current mirror circuit 3 including a P channel type transistor T₉ having a drain connected to a terminal OUT for outputting a predetermined constant current, and the other P channel transistors T₁ , T₄ , and T₇. Thus, if it is assumed that the value of the current flowing through the transistor T₇ is I₁ , the value I₂ of the current flowing through the transistor T₉ namely, the current obtained from the constant current output terminal OUT is determined by the following equation, where each of β₇ and β₉ is the current amplification factor of each of the transistors T₇ and T₉. In this connection, the current amplification factor β is a parameter representing the ability of a transistor and is a constant value determined by the size of the transistor, mobility, and thickness of a gate oxide layer of the transistor, and so on. Therefore, if the reference voltage V In this connection, a circuit such as shown in Fig. 6 is a previously proposed constant current output circuit able to output a predetermined constant current by using a variable resistor R As shown in Fig. 6, the circuit comprises a current mirror circuit 5 including a pair of P channel transistors T₂₁ and T₂₂ having gates connected to a drain of the transistor T₂₁ , and the variable resistor R Thus, the value I₂ of the current output from the terminal OUT becomes proportional to the value I₁ of the current flowing through the variable resistor R Contrary to this, according to the above mentioned circuit of the present invention as shown in Fig. 3, it is possible to output the predetermined constant current with a high accuracy and stability, and to obtain a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising a constant current source of low power namely, a constant current source consuming only little power . As above mentioned, in the circuits according to the first and second embodiments of the present invention as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, MOS transistors are used as the transistors T₁ to T₉. It is not always necessary to use MOS transistors as these transistors T₁ to T₉ , and bipolar transistors, for example, can be used instead of these MOS transistors. Figure 4 shows a circuit diagram illustrating a third embodiment of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the present invention, which comprises bipolar transistors T₁ to T₈ corresponding to the MOS transistors T₁ to T₈ shown in Fig. 2. The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 4, is the same as that of the circuit shown in Fig. 2. Figure 5 shows a circuit diagram illustrating a fourth embodiment of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the present invention, which comprises bipolar transistors T₁ to T₉ corresponding to the MOS transistors T₁ to T₉ shown in Fig. 3. The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 5, is the same as that of the circuit shown in Fig. 3. In this connection, as mentioned above, it is not always necessary to provide the transistor T₂ in each of the circuits shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, and therefore, in each of the circuits shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the above transistor T₂ is not provided. As described above it is possible to obtain a low power analog buffer amplifier able to regulate the current supplied from the power supply source in accordance with the value of the load driven by the analog buffer amplifier, and to lower the power consumption. Simultaneously, it is not necessary to provide a capacitor in the circuit for correcting the phase, and thus it is possible to reduce the total area needed for the layout of the semiconductor integrated circuit. Further, it is possible to obtain a constant current output circuit having not only the same advantages as those of the above analog buffer amplifier, but also able to output a predetermined constant current with a high accuracy and stability.
