## Description
Heterojunction bipolar transistor and method of manufacturing the same The present invention relates to a heterojunction bipolar transistor and a method of manufacturing the same. A heterojunction bipolar transistor using an emitter or collector layer having a wider forbidden band gap than that of a base layer is receiving a great deal of attention as a bipolar transistor with a large current amplification factor and a low base resistance.In this bipolar transistor, a base pushout effect is also suppressed. A combination of A GaAs and GaAs, orInGaAsP and InP has been used for conventional heterojunction bipolar transistors due to relatively easy crystal growth. Wafers for the conventional heterojunction bipolar transistors are formed by LPE Liquid Phase Epitaxy , MOCVD Metal Organic ChemicalVapor Deposition or MBE Molecular Beam Epitaxy . The heterojunction bipolar transistor has an advantage in that its base resistance can be substantially decreased because an impurity concentration in the base layer can be increased. How to form the base electrode without impairing this advantage is a conventional problem. For example, a heterojunction bipolar transistor in which the base electrode is directly embedded in the wide gap p type external base A GaAs layer is described byC. Dubon et al. in, Double Heterojunction GaAs GaAQAs Bipolar Transistors Grown by MOCVD for Emitter CoupledLogic Circuits , IEEE, IEDM83, pp. 689 693. With this structure, however, since the base electrode is formed on an MGaAs layer with a wide forbidden band gap, the contact resistance of the base electrode is increased. In addition, since the AZGaAs layer contains AX, the layer tends to be oxidized, degrading reproducibility of the electrode. A heterojunction transistor which has a high resistive region between emitter and base is described by P.M. Asbeck et al. in, Application of Thermal PulseAnnealing to Ion Implanted GaA As GaAs HeterojunctionBipolar Transistors , IEEE, Electron Device Letters,Vol. EDL 4, No. 4, April 1983, pp. 81 84. With this structure, however, since ion implantation is performed to form the high resistive region, the heterojunction bipolar transistor has a large number of defect recombination centers generated near the emitter base junction. Therefore, the current amplification factor is decreased. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved heterojunction bipolar transistor having a high current amplification factor and a low base electrode contact resistance. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing the heterojunction bipolar transistor having the above mentioned characteristics. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heterojunction bipolar transistor comprising a first semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type which serves as a collector region a second semiconductor layer of a second conductivity type which is formed on the first semiconductor layer and which serves as a base region a third semiconductor layer of the first conductivity type which is formed on the second semiconductor layer and which serves as an emitter region, the portion of the third semiconductor layer which contacts the second semiconductor layer having a forbidden band gap that is wider than that of the second semiconductor layer an external base region of the second conductivity type formed in the third semiconductor layer so as to surround the emitter region, the external base region being both formed to reach the second semiconductor layer and provided with a recess of a depth sufficient to partially expose the second semiconductor layer a base electrode formed contacting an exposed portion of the second semiconductor layer in the recess a collector electrode electrically connected to the first semiconductor layer and an emitter electrode electrically connected to the third semiconductor layer. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a heterojunction bipolar transistor comprising the steps of al epitaxially growing a first semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type on a semiconductor substrate, the first semiconductor layer serving as a collector region a2 epitaxially growing a second semiconductor layer of a second conductivity type on the first semiconductor layer, the second semiconductor layer serving as a base region a3 epitaxially growing a third semiconductor layer of the first conductivity type on the second semiconductor layer, the third semiconductor layer serving as an emitter region, and that portion of the third semiconductor layer which contacts the second semiconductor layer having a forbidden band gap that is wider than that of the second semiconductor layer a4 doping an impurity in the third semiconductor layer so as to surround the emitter region to form an external base region of the second conductivity type having a depth reaching the second semiconductor layer a5 partially etching the external base region to expose the second semiconductor layer a6 forming a base electrode so as to contact an exposed portion of the second semiconductor layer and a7 forming emitter and collector electrodes, electrically connected to the emitter region and the first semiconductor layer, respectively. Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following description, given in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a heterojunction bipolar transistor according to a first embodiment of the present invention Figs. 2A to 2D are sectional views explaining steps in manufacturing the heterojunction bipolar transistor shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a plan view of the device of Fig. 2D Fig. 4 is a graph showing the relationship between the collector current and the current amplification factor of the heterojunction bipolar transistor of the present invention Fig. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the collector current and the cut off frequency fT of the heterojunction bipolar transistor of the present invention and Figs. 6A to 6E are sectional views explaining the steps in manufacturing a heterojunction bipolar transistor according to a second embodiment of the present invention. A heterojunction bipolar transistor according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3. Fig. 1 shows the structure of an A GaAs GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor. The structure will be described in accordance with the manufacturing steps in Figs. 2A to 2D. For ease of illustration, a collector electrode is not illustrated in Figs. 2A to 2D. In this embodiment, semiconductor layers for the collector, base and emitter of the transistor are epitaxially grown by MOCVD. However, MBE can be used in place of MOCVD. As shown in Fig. 2A, a first semiconductor layer serving as a collector is formed on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10. The first semiconductor layer comprises an n type GaAs layer 12 epitaxially grown on the GaAs substrate 10, and an n type GaAs layer 14 epitaxially grown on the layer 12.A second semiconductor layer serving as a base is epitaxially grown on the first semiconductor layer.The second semiconductor layer comprises a p typeGaAs layer 16. A third semiconductor layer serving as an emitter is epitaxially grown on the second semiconductor layer. The third semiconductor layer comprises an n type MGaAs layer 18 epitaxially grown on the layer 16, and an n type GaAs layer 20 epitaxially grown on the layer 18. Thicknesses of the layers 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 are 0.5 um, 0.5 vm, 0.1 pm, 0.2 pm and 0.1 um, respectively. The composition ratio of At to GaAs in the layer 18 is 0.25 0.75. After the epitaxial wafer described above is formed, an SiO2 film mask 22 having a thickness of 0.8 pm is formed by photolithography on a prospective emitter region. By using the mask 22, the uppermost layer 20 and a predetermined thickness of the layer 18 are etched to expose the layer 18. As shown in Fig. 2B, Mg ions are implanted at a dose of 2 x 1014 cm2 and an acceleration voltage of 200 keV, while the mask 22 is left intact. Thereafter, annealing is performed to form a low resistance P type layer 24 which serves as an external base region.Subsequently, a mask is formed to cover a portion from the emitter region to part of the external base region, and B ions are implanted at a dose of 7 x 1012 cm2 and an acceleration voltage of 150 keV. This ion implanted layer is annealed to form a high resistance layer 26 for isolating the base from the collector. Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 2C, a photoresist pattern having an opening corresponding to a prospective base electrode is formed, and the layer 18 is etched to form a recess 28 extending from part of the external base region to part of the layer 26. The layer 16 is exposed at the bottom surface of the recess 28. Since slight M diffusion from the layer 18 is present in the layer 16, the surface of the layer 16 should, preferably, be overetched to remove the AQ diffusion layer. After the layer 16 is exposed, aAu Zn alloy is deposited while the photoresist pattern is left intact. The photo resist is subsequently removed by a lift off technique to form a base electrode 30. As shown in Fig. 1, a high resistance element isolation layer 32 is formed by proton ion implantation.Etching is also performed to form a contact hole 34 for the collector electrode. Thereafter, the entire surface of the resultant structure is covered with a CVD SiO2 film 36, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2D. The oxide film 36 is selectively etched and a Au Ge alloy film is deposited and then lifted off to form emitter and collector electrodes 38 and 40. Now, Fig. 3 is a plan view of the device of Fig. 2D. In the bipolar transistor of this embodiment, a sheet resistance of the external base region 24 formed by ion implantation is 300 n s, which is smaller than the sheet resistance of 1 kQ O of the internal base layer 16. Furthermore, a p n junction formed in the surface layer of the element comprises a homojunction in the A GaAs layer having a wide forbidden band gap.Therefore, a wasteful current which does not contribute to the operation of the intrinsic transistor can not flow through the homojunction. Consequently, a high current amplification factor can be obtained. A high resistance layer is required in the device described by P.M. Asbeck et al. in, Application ofThermal Pulse Annealing to Ion Implanted GaAÀs GaAs heterojunction Bipolar Transistors , IEEE, ElectronDevice Letters, Vol. EDL 4, No. 4, April 1983, pp. 81 84. However, the high resistance layer need not be formed in the present invention to eliminate the p n homojunction of the GaAs layer having a narrow forbidden band gap. A low sheet resistance is maintained in the external base region, and generation recombination centers are not formed near the emitterbase junction. According to the effect described above, the heterojunction bipolar transistor has a high current amplification factor and can be operated at high speed. In the above embodiment, since the base electrode 30 contacts the p type GaAs layer 16 doped with a high concentration impurity and having a narrow forbidden band gap, its specific contact resistance is about 3 x 10 7 ncm2. This value is about 1 10 that of the device described by C. Dubon et al. in, DoubleHeterojunction GaAs GaAÀs Bipolar Transistors Grown by MOCVD for Emitter Coupled Logic Circuits , IEEE,IEDM83, pp. 689 693. As such, good reproducilility of the contact resistance of the base electrode 30 can be accomplished in the transistor of this embodiment. Furthermore, since the emitter electrode 38 is connected to the layer 20 doped with a high concentration impurity, its specific contact resistance is as small as about 5 x 10 7 ncm2. Therefore, the heterojunction bipolar transistor of this embodiment can be operated with a high current density of 1 x 105 A cm2. Fig. 4 shows a common emitter current amplification factor of the transistor of this embodiment, as compared with that of a conventional transistor. The conventional transistor is a device having a high resistance layer to eliminate a p n homojunction of aGaAs layer. The emitter size of the heterojunction bipolar transistor used in this experiment is 2 ijm x 5 vm. In the conventional transistor, the carrier recombination rate is high due to an ion doped damage layer formed near the emitter base junction, resulting in a substantial decrease of the current amplification factor in the low collector current region. According to this embodiment, however, a high current amplification factor, even in a low collector current region, can be obtained. Fig. 5 shows the cut off frequency fT of the transistor of this embodiment, as compared with that of the conventional transistor. In the conventional transistor having a high resistance layer, when the emitter base junction is forward biased, electrons and holes are injected into the high resistance region formed near the emitter base junction surface. The injection carriers serve as an accumulation capacitor connected in parallel with the emitter base junction.For this reason, the cut off frequency characteristics of the conventional heterojunction bipolar transistor are degraded. According to this embodiment, however, the accumulation effect can be eliminated, thereby improving the cut off frequency. By employing the structure of the present invention, the electrical characteristics of the heterojunction bipolar transistor can be greatly improved in a DC and high frequency range. The above embodiment is exemplified by theA GaAs GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor. The present invention can also be applied to a device manufactured by other semiconductor materials.Furthermore, in the above embodiment the external base region is formed by ion implantation. However, the external base region may be formed by Zn diffusion or the like. In the above embodiment, the emitter junction comprises a heterojunction. However, the collector junction may also comprise a heterojunction. A heterojunction bipolar transistor according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 6A to 6E. As shown in Fig. 6A, a first semiconductor layer serving as a collector is formed by MBE on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 10. The first semiconductor layer comprises an n type GaAs layer 12 epitaxially grown on the substrate 10, and an n type GaAs layer 14 epitaxially grown on the layer 12. The layer 12 has a thickness of 0.5 ijm so as to achieve good ohmic contact with a collector electrode. The layer 14 has a thickness of 0.5 vm. A second semiconductor layer serving as a base is epitaxially grown on the first semiconductor layer.The second semiconductor layer comprises a 0.1 vm thick p type GaAs layer 16. A third semiconductor layer, as an emitter, is epitaxially grown on the second semiconductor layer. The third semiconductor layer comprises a 0.2 ijm thick n type AQGaAs layer 18, and a 0.5 Dm thick n type GaAs layer 20. A heterojunction is formed between the layer 16 as the second semiconductor layer and the layer 18 of the third semiconductor layer. The ratio of At to Ga in the layer 18 is, for example, 3 7. After such an epitaxial wafer is prepared, an SiO2 film mask 22 having a thickness of 0.8 pm is formed on a prospective emitter region by photolithography. By using the mask 22, the uppermost layer 20 and a predetermined thickness of the layer 18 are etched to expose the layer 18. As shown in Fig. 6B, Mg ions are implanted at a dose of 2 x 1014 cm2 and an acceleration voltage of 200 keV while the mask 22 is left intact. Thereafter, annealing is performed to form a low resistance p type layer 24 serving as an external base region.Subsequently, a mask is formed to cover a portion extending from the emitter region to part of the external base region, and B ions are implanted at a dose of 7 x 1012 cm2 and an acceleration voltage of 150 keV. This ion implanted layer is annealed to form a high resistance layer 26 for separating the base from the collector. As shown in Fig. 6C, a photoresist pattern having an opening corresponding to a prospective base electrode region is formed. By using this pattern, the layer 18 is etched to form a recess 28 extending from part of the external base region to part of the high resistance layer 26. In this case, the layer 16 is exposed at the bottom surface of the recess 28. Since slight AQ diffusion from the layer 18 to the layer 16 is present, the surface layer of the layer 16 should, preferably, be overetched to remove the AQ diffusion layer. After the layer 16 is partially exposed, a Au Zn alloy is deposited while the photoresist pattern is left intact.The photoresist is then lifted off by a solvent to form a base electrode 30. As shown in Fig. 6D, a silica solution e.g., OCD solution available from Tokyo Oka K.K. is spin coated at a speed of 2,000 rpm to form a film on the entire surface which is then annealed at 3000C to form a 0.5 vm thick SiO2 film 50. The thickness of the film 50 on the projected emitter region is as thin as about 0.1 cm, and the film has a substantially flat surface. As shown in Fig. 6E, the SiO2 film 50 is etched byRIE, using CF4 gas to expose the top surface and a part of the side surface of the n type GaAs layer 20 of the emitter region. An emitter electrode 38 is formed by deposition of a Au Ge film and a lift off technique.The electrode 38 contacts at least the top surface of the layer 20. The electrode 38 is alloyed with GaAs by annealing at a temperature of about 400 C, thereby providing good ohmic contact between the electrode 38 and the layer 20. Formation of a base wiring layer for the base electrode is omitted. However, in practice, a contact hole is formed in the film 50 on the electrode 30 to form the base wiring layer. As for the collector electrode, mesa etching is performed at a predetermined location to expose the n type GaAs layer 12, and aAu Ge film is formed through this contact hole to contact the collector region. When a plurality of the above mentioned transistors are integrated, an element isolation region may be formed by radiation of proton. According to the second embodiment, the following effects can be obtained in addition to those of the first embodiment. The electrode 38 can be formed by using a mask pattern larger than the emitter region so that the emitter electrode 38 can be formed to contact the entire surface of the emitter region. Therefore, the emitter contact resistance can be decreased. The size of the emitter region is determined by RIE of Fig. 6A, and the emitter electrode width can be increased to be greater than the emitter region width. Therefore, the emitter region size can be decreased to its treatment limit, thereby obtaining a high performance heterojunction bipolar transistor.
