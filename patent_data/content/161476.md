## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing a negative tone resist image. GB A 2097143 discloses a process for obtaining negative tone plasma resist images. That publication is concerned with a process involving entrapment of a silicon containing monomer into a host film at the time of exposure to radiation and requires a processing step to expel the unincorporated silicon monomer from the film before plasma development of the relief image. US A 4,307,178 4,389,482 and 4,396,704 disclose the use of oxygen plasmas in developing negative resist images. US Patent 4,307,177 discloses the use of onium salts as sensitizers. JA 59 61928 A discloses the use of an organic compound steam including Si to form a resistive polymer film on the irradiated areas of a polymer thin film, prior to development with an oxygen plasma. Extended Abstracts Vol. B 82, Oct. 1982, p 321 322 describes a method for making a resist pattern on a film of poly methyl methacrylate by first irradiating the film with an electron beam and then treating the film with chlorosilanes, prior to development with an oxygen plasma. The invention seeks to provide an improved process for producing such a negative tone resist image. A process for producing a negative tone resist image comprises, according to the invention, the successive steps of exposing a film of a polymer bearing a masked reactive functionality to a pattern of radiation, the film having such a composition that after exposure to the radiation the masked reactive functionality is unmasked and the exposed areas of the film react with an organometallic reagent treating the exposed film with the organometallic reagent and developing a relief image by further treating the exposed film with an oxygen plasma. We have found that a high resolution negative tone resist image can be produced by carrying out the following procedure Compositions suitable for use in the present invention can take several forms. In one embodiment, the masking group is directly removed upon exposure to radiation. The unmasked functionality which is generated in such a fashion is reactive towards several organo metallic reagents, while the masked polymer is not. Such materials, for example, include but are not restricted to poly p formyloxystyrene and copolymers prepared from p formyloxystyrene. In a second embodiment, the formulation consists of a polymer containing a reactive functionality that is masked by an acid labile protecting group and a species that is capable of generating acid upon exposure to radiation. In such systems, exposure or exposure followed by heat, serves to unmask the reactive functionality. Examples of such polymers include, but are not restricted to to poly t butyl methacrylate and poly t butyloxycarbonyloxystyrene and copolymers derived from t butyl methacrylate or t butyloxycarbonyloxystyrene. Examples of materials that produce acid upon exposure are well known in the art and include various onium salts and haloalkanes. Organometallic reagents that are capable of selective reaction with the unmasked side chain functionality are well known in the art. A wide range of readily available organometallic reagents are useful in this process. These include, for example, but are not limited to trimethylstannyl chloride, hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsilyl chloride. These reagents, which can be used in either an appropriate solvent or in the vapor phase, will react with unmasked functional groups such as COOH, OH, NHâ‚‚ etc. The development of the relief image uses oxygen plasma or reactive ion etching techniques that are performed in a conventional fashion. The preferred polymers for use in the present invention are those having acid labile groups pendant from a polymer backbone. Particularly preferred are those in which such groups are esters of a carboxylic acid or a carbonic acid. Polymers of this sort are described in US A 4,491,628. That document also refers to the onium sensitizers which are most preferred for use in the present invention. These include diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulfonium salts and substituted aryldiazonium salts. The most preferred gegenanions of the salts are complex metal halides such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluoroantimonate, hexafluoroarsenate and hexafluorophosphate. In general, the sensitizer onium salt should be present in the polymers in an amount from about 1 to 100 on a weight to weight basis. The preferred organometallic species, for use in the present invention are those that are capable of reacting with the unmasked pendant functionality. Particularly preferred are silylating reagents which are well known in the art and any suitable one may be used. As an example of a preferred reagent hexamethyldisilizane HMDS may be mentioned. In one embodiment of the present invention, a thin film of polymer sensitized by the addition of an onium salt is used as an overcoat for a thick film of an organic polymer which need not be sensitized the thick film is on a substrate such as silicon . In general, the thin sensitized, overcoating film is about 1 micron thick, and the overcoated film about 4 to 6 microns thick. In this way, high aspect ratio relief images are generated in a general organic film. In another embodiment of the present invention, a dye is added to the thin film formulation. Dyes useful for this purpose include, for example, polycyclic aromatic compounds and their derivatives. Perlyene is a particularly useful dye. The development step using oxygen reaction ion etching is carried out in conventional fashion. One micron thick films of The present invention has several distinct and unpredictable advantages over known negative tone resist processes. First, the process does not require a solvent development step and therefore has the advantage of being both simple and more environmentally acceptable in use. It has been demonstrated to operate at extremely low doses of exposing radiation and over a wide range of exposing wavelengths. These wavelengths include, but are not limited to, X ray, electron beams and ultraviolet light from 220 to 450 nm. The images obtained from this process exhibit vertical wall profiles, and show minimal thickness loss in the exposed regions when processed in the prescribed manner.
