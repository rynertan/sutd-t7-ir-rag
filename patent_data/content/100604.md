# Process for converting methanol and or dimethyl ether to iso c4 compounds, and catalysts for use therein.

## Abstract
Methanol and or dimethyl ether is converted to a hydrocarbon product rich in iso Câ‚„ compounds by contact with a catalyst comprising crystalline silica having molecular sieve properties or a crystalline solid with molecular sieve properties which has been impregnated with one or more of thorium oxide, zirconium oxide and titanium oxide. A novel catalyst comprises the thus impregnated crystalline silica.
