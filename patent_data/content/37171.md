# Locking device for curing rims.

## Abstract
A curing rim comprising two abutting, coaxial, relatively rotatable sleeves 11, 12 , one having radially inward bosses 20 and the other having axially projecting hooks 21 which can rotate into engagement with the bosses to prevent axial displacement between the sleeves. A latch hook 30 is pivoted to one of the hooks and resiliently engages the apposed boss to prevent rotation between the sleeves. A push bar 24 is passed through a pair of loops 22 and 23 and has a projection 37 which can engage the latch hook to disable its function.
