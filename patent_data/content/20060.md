# Cement production from residues from conversion of coal or the like.

## Abstract
Cement is produced by feeding into a cement making zone the residue solids containing carbonaceous material and ash constituents. The residue solids may be obtained from a coal, or like material, conversion process, for example coal pyrolysis or liquefaction. Advantageously, however, the residue solids are obtained from a gasification process of coal or like material. The residue solids pass through a mixing zone 74 to supplement their calcium and silica content and are converted to cement by passage through a precalciner 77 and rotary kiln 79 .
