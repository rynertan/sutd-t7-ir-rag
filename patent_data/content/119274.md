# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AMINOALKYLSULFONIC ACIDS.

## Abstract
A process for producing in a high yield aminoalkylsul fonic acids represented by the formula I wherein R₁, R₂, and R₃ each represent hydrogen, C₁ ₃ alkyl or hydroxy containing C₁ ₃ alkyl, X represents chlorine, bromine or iodine and n represents 2 or 3, which process comprises adding continuously or intermittently by portions over a certain period of time to a heated aqueous sulfite solution a alkylamine hydrohalide represented by the formula II . The yield can be increased by conducting the reaction, after the addition of the alkylamine hydrohalide, in such a manner that the reaction temperature is stepwise raised in 2 to 5 steps in each of which the reaction time and the tem perature raising rate are set to 0.5 to 4 hours and 10 to 20 C step, respectively.
