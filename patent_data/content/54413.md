# Combined television camera and recording apparatus.

## Abstract
An example of the apparatus is a portable video tape recorder. The transducer 28 to tape 130 velocity is con trolled by a rotary member such as a capstan, turnable or headwheel 22 . Motion of the recorder may cause accelera tions or variations in velocity of the headwheel 22 which affect the regular spacing on the tape of sync or timing signals transduced thereto. Regular spacing of sync signals is desirable for good reproduction on playback. Timing or sync signals generated by a signal generating wheel 34 coupled to the headwheel 22 are used to control the application of the video timing signals to the transducer, thereby making the spacing regular. In the combined recorder and camera, the timing signals from the generating wheel 34 control the image scanning 76, 56 in the camera and also the chroma production 65, 58 . In another example, video signals are written into a digital memory and read out of it at a rate determined by the timing signals from the generating wheel.
