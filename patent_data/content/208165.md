## Description
A SAILING APPARATUS FOR TOWING A DRIVING VEHICLE The invention relates to a sailing apparatus for towing a driving vehicle,comprising a sailing propulsor composed of a sail stretched by a supporting structure, which is considerably spaced from the driving vehicle. The apparatus is particularly suitable to reach high speeds. It is known that the area of the sail of a sailboat must be lower than a critical limit, depending on the wind pressure and on the weight and shape of the sailboat. It is dangerous to exceed such limit since the overturning moment of the wind acts on the mast and can easily upset the sailboat. On the other hand the speed and the power of the sailboat can be increased only exceeding such limit,and therefore many attempts have been made to suggest the way to decrease the overturning moment of the wind on the mast, providing a sailboat devoid of mast, wherein the sail is considerably spaced from the boat. German Patent 560512 discloses a towing trimaran provided with a fin f to prevent the drift.It does not solve however the problem, since the overturning moment remains the same without any improvement. U.S. Pat NO 3,094,961 relates to a sail supported by three fins, which support also the load L . The load is not therefore spaced from the sail,and no steering means is provided. U.S. Pat NO 3,631,828, U.S. Pat NO 3,646,902,U.S. Pat NO 3,831,539, and U.S. Pat N0 4,228,750 all disclose steering means formed by driving fins. Sauces the sails disclosed therein tend to get an aft wind tack, such fins can prevent this tendency only giving rise to a large turbolence in their immersion area so limiting the speed. Further, in consequence, large dangerous reaction forces are rised, which can break the structure or require an oversizing. Analogously French Pat Application NO 81 15443 and U.S. Pat NO 3,981,258 disclose a forced steering of the sail with respect to the boat. These structures are suitable only for an aft wind tack otherwise the force rised from the forced steering will give rise to a large turbolence around the fin keel and the rudder of the boat. U.S. Pat NO 4,061,099, U.S. Pat NO 4,326,475 and French Pat Application NO 82 06114 disclose asymmetric catamarans which usually achieve good speed performances, but which are dangerous, since a sudden upset is always possible. They further imply a bulky structure. French Pat Application Nb 82 00743 discloses a sail which is in a fixed relationship with respect to the boat, which therefore can always steer only along the same single particular tack. G.B. Pat Application NO 2 098 946 A, G.B. PatApplication NO 2 098 947 A, G.B. Pat Application NO 2 098 948 A, G.B. Pat Application NO 2 098 949 A, G.B.Pat Application NO 2 098 950 A, G.B. Pat Application N0 2 098 951 A and G.B. Pat Application N0 2 098 952 A disclose the use of elevated sails to tow ships. Such use is possible only for low speeds and with strong and unchanged winds otherwise such sails are unstable. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved sailing apparatus which is of easy driving along all tacks. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved portable lightweight sailing rig, of a type capable of towing driving vehicles as surfers, boats or other various vehicles as swimmers, sledges, iceboats, carts on the base surface of travelling, which may be the surface of the water, of the snow, of the ice, of the sand, and so on. It is a further object of the instant invention to provide an improved sailing apparatus capable of reaching very high speeds. The foregoing and other objects are reached by a sailing apparatus for towing a driving vehicle comprising a sailing propulsor composed of a sail stretched by a supporting structure guys connecting said sailing propulsor to a towing point placed on said driving vehicle two distinct rotating supporting members sliding on the base surface of travelling, the first supporting member being connected to the right lower end of said supporting structure, the second supporting member being connected to the left lower end of said supporting structure said sailing propulsor being considerably spaced from said driving vehicle and being free to rotate. around said towing point the relative distance from said towing point of the left side of said propulsor with respect to the right side being variable the relative distance from said towing point of the lower side of said propulsor with respect to the higher side being variable said distinct rotating supporting members being free to rotate by a nearly vertical axis. The instant invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description, when considered in conjunction with the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a sailing apparatus in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged detail view partly broken away 6f the handgrip of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a top plan view of the winders Figure 4 is a side elevation view of Figure 3 in enlarged detail of a winder Figure 5 is a side elevation view of Figure 4 taken along the line V V thereof Figure 6 is a top plan view of the driving rod Figure 7 is a side elevation view of a first embodiment of the invention Figure 8 is a side elevation view of a second embodiment of the invention Figure 9 is a side elevation view of a third embodiment of the invention Figure 10 is a side elevation view of the sailing craft of Figure 9 Figure 11 is a side elevation view somewhat similar to Figure 8 of a fourth embodiment of the invention Figure 12 is a side elevation view of a fifth embodiment of the invention Figure 13 is a side elevation view of a sixth embodiment of the invention Figure 14 is a side elevation view of a rotating supporting member Figure 15 is a side elevation view of Figure 14, taken in enlarged, partly broken away, detail. With reference to Figures 1 to 15, a sailing apparatus for towing a driving vehicle,according to the invention comprises a sailing propulsor composed of a sail 10 stretched by a supporting structure. The particular supporting structure is the main difference among the embodiments of Figures 7 to 13. With particular reference to Figure 1, the sailing propulsor is connected to the towing point 7, placed on the driving vehicle, by the guys 23, 24, 25 and 26 the driving vehicle is formed, for example, by the surfboard 21. The sailing propulsor is supported on the base surface of travelling, i.e. on the surface of the water, by two distinct rotating supporting members formed by floats, which slide on the surface of the water. The first float 19 is connected to the right lower end 13 of the supporting structure, the second float 20 is connected to the left lower end 12 of the supporting structure. The sailing propulsor is considerably spaced from the surfboard 21 of a distance corresponding to the length of the guys 23, 24, 25 and 26. The sailing propulsor is free to rotate around the towing point 7, on the surfboard 21, always being at a distance corresponding to the length of guys. The towing point 7 supports the feet of the surfer. Each of the four guys 23,24,25 and 26 is connected to an end of the sailing propulsor in a particular connecting point, respectively 29, 30, 28 and 27. On the other end, the four guys 23, 24, 25 and 26 are connected to the towing point 7 of the surfboard 21 by means of the body of the surfer 22. The relative distance from the towing point 7 of the left side 28, 29 of the propulsor,with respect to the distance from the towing point 7 of the right side 27, 30 is variable and the relative distance from the towing point 7 of the lower side 27, 28 with respect to the distance from the towing point 7 of the higher side 29, 30 is variable. The floats 19 and 20 are free to rotate by a nearly vertical axis, the true direction of such axis depends on the variability of the rake of the propulsor. With reference to Figures 1, 2 and 6,the left guys,which connect the propulsor to the towing point of the driving vehicle,are connected together, as well as the right guys are connected together. Considering particularly Figures 1 and 2, the handgrips 31 and 32 allow to hand easier the guy the hand 40 of the surfer may let the guy slide or grip into the sleeve 41.However if the size of the guys is large enough, no handgrip is necessary since the couple of guys 24 and 26 may slide or be gripped directly in the right hand of the surfer, as well as the couple 23 and 25 in the left hand. In the embodiment of Figure 6, the left guys 23 and 25 are connected to the left end of a driving rod 35 and the right guys 24 and 26 are connected to the right end of the driving rod 35. The grommet 8 allows to control the sliding and the gripping of the guys 24 and 26,as well as of the guys 23 and 25, so allowing to control the regulation of the relative distance from the towing point 7 of the lower side and of the higher side. The regulation of the relative distance from the.towing point 7 of the left side and of the right side is achieved simply manually turning the driving rod 35 around it vertical axis. According to the embodiment of Figures 3, 4 andS,each of the guys 23, 24, 25 and 26 comprises a winder arranged on the driving vehicle. This embodiment is particularly suitable for boats, wherein the strong towing forces cannot be directly supported in the hands. The set of winders 58 is connected to the towing point on the boat by the ring 60. Each of the winders 45, 46, 47 and 48 is independently regulable, by the pins 49, 50 and 51, which are supported on the rod 56.Each pin can engage one of the notches 52, 53, 54 and 55 provided on each winder 45, 46, 47 and 48. Each winder can slide along a traverse, which is delimited by the supports 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74, so engaging or releasing the pins 49, 50 and 51. With reference to Figure 3, the winder 45 is engaged with the respective pin, while the winders 46, 47, and 48 are released. With reference to Figure 5, there is disclosed the inner form of each of the notches 52, 53, 54 and 55. In particular, the notch 54 comprises an undercut 57 to lock the winder in its engaged position. The crank 61 allows to wind or unwind simultaneously all the winders. The crank 61 can be locked by the rod 62. The relative winding of the winders 45 and 46, connected to the left guys 25, 23, with respect to the winders 47, 48, connected to the right guys, allows to regulate the relative distance from the towing point of the left side and of the right side of the propulsor.The relative winding of the winders 46 and 47, connected to the higher guys 23, 24, with respect to the winders 45, 48, connected to the lower guys, allows to regulate the relative distance from the towing point of the lower side and of the higher side of the propulsor. With reference to Figures 8 and 11, the supporting structure comprises one nearly vertical shore 105 and two horizontal booms 106 and 107. The true direction of the axis of the vertical shore 105 depends upon the regulation of the rake of the propulsor with respect to the vertical. The two ends of the shore 105 are connected each to the middle part of one of the two horizontal booms 106 and 107. The sail 10 is directly supported only by the two horizontal booms 106 and 107. The first float 19 is connected to the right end of the lower horizontal boom 106, the second float 20 is connected to the left end of the lower horizontal boom 106. With reference to Figure 8, the ends 110 and 111 of the shore 105 are threaded on the joints 108 and 109,so that the rotation of the shore 105 around its axis allows to control the stretching of the sail 10.The Joint 108 is locked on the boom 106 to prevent the rotation of the boom 106 around its axis. With reference to Figure 11, the boom 106 engages the joint 36, which is detachable. In the engagement area, the boom 106 has a SqUE profile to prevent the rotation of the boom 106 around its axis.The stretching of the sail 10 is allowed by a rope, not shown engaging both the end of the shore 105 and the middle part of the boom 107. With reference to Figure 12, the supporting structure comprises two or more vertically spaced horizontal shores .140 and 141, and two nearly vertical booms 142 and 143. The sail 10 is directly supported by the vertical booms 142 and 143. The first float 19 is connected to the lower end of the rigth vertical boom 143 the second float 20 is connected to the lower end of the left vertical boom 142. Preferably, the floats 19 and 20 are connected to the lower ends of the vertical booms 142 and 143 by an horizontal rod 144, each end of the horizontal rod 144 directly supports one of the floats 19 and 20. The stretching of the sail 10 is allowed by a rope not shown engaging both the right end of the shore 141 and the boom 143 and by another rope not shown engaging both the right end of the shore 140 andsthe boom 143 so that the shores 140 and 141 are charged by compression load. With reference to Figures 9 and 10, the supporting structure comprises three shores 120, 121 and 122,arranged as the legs of an isosceles triangle having the base on the leg 120. The three shores 120, 121 and 122 are connected, at their ends, on the apexes of the triangle, by three joints 123, 124 and 125. Each of the two joints 123 and 125, connected to the leg 120, base of the triangle, directly supports one of the floats 19 and 20. The stretching of the sail is allowed by the ropes 135 and 137 which connect the joints 123 and 125 respectively to the rods 126 and 128, which directly support the sail 10. The rod 127 is engaged by the joint 124. The propulsor is connected to the towing point by three guys 25, 26 and 131, which may be connected,for example,to three winders placed on the driving vehicle. With reference to Figure 7, the supporting structure comprises a plurality of shores, in particular three 97, 98 and 99, arranged radially, starting from a central joint 100. The first float 19 is connected to the lower end of a lower shore 98, the second float 20 is connected to the lower end of the other lower shore 97. The shores 97,98 and 99 are charged by compression load. The stretching of the sail is allowed by a rope not shown connecting the end 103 of the shore 99 to the rod 93 which supports the sail 10. The connection of each of the shores 97 and 98 to the joint 100 prevents the rotation of each of the shores 97 and 98 around their axis. For such purpose the ends of the shores 97 and 98 are shaped in any particular form able to engage the joint 100 preventing such rotation for example they may be shaped in squared profile. With reference to Figures 1 and 13, the supporting structure comprises a nearly vertical shore 91. The true direction of the axis of the shore 91 depends on the variability of the rake of the propulsor. The higher end of the shore 91 supports two shores 11 and 14 by a Y joint 101. The lower end of the shore 91 supports two shores 12 and 13 by a second Y joint 102. The first float 19 is connected to the shore 13 and the second float 20 is connected to the shore 12.The connection of each of the shores 12 and 13 to the Y joint 102 prevents the rotation of each of the shores 12 and 13 around their axis. For such purpose the ends of the shores 12 and 13 are shaped in any particular form able to engage the joint 102 preventing such rotation for example they may be shaped in squared profile. According to a further embodiment not shown in the drawings the supporting structure comprises two shores arranged in cross form. The first float is connected to the lower end of one of the shores, the second float is connected to the lower end of the other shore. In the crossing point the two shores.are bounded together to prevent their rotation around their respective axis. With reference to Figures 1, and 7 to 14, each of the two floats is connected to one of the two lower ends of the supporting structure by an hinged joint 33 and 34, having a substantially vertical rotation axis, which depends upon the rake of the propulsor.Preferably, according to the embodiments of Figures 8, 11, 12 and 14, the direction of the rotation axis of the hinge of the hinged Joint 33 or 34 is regulable with respect to the supporting structure to predetermine a vertical direction of the rotation axis in relation to a particular rake of the supporting structure. Such regulation is achieved for example releasing and fastening suitable clamping means, such as the clamp 150. With reference to the embodiments of Figures 1, 7, 9, 10 and 13, the direction of the rotation axis of the hinge of the hinged joint 33 or 34 is not regulable with respect to the supporting structure and the joints 33 and 34 are fixed to their respective supporting shore. With reference to Figures 14 and 15, each of the floats 19 and 20 comprises a smooth running cantilever part 151, which is shaped as the bottom of a surf to slide on the surface of the water. The float 19 comprises a connecting rod 152, which connects the hinged joint 34 to the surf 151. The angle of the connession between the connecting rod 152 and the surf 151 is regulable, to predetermine a particular angle of incidence of the surf 151 with respect to the surface of the water. Such regulation is achieved controlling the rotation of the tube 155 into the surf 151, by the pin 153 which engages the tube 155 through one of the holes 154 on the surf 151. Each hole 154 allows the engagement of a different hole of the tube 155, cOrresponding to a particular rotation of the tube. Since the connecting rod 152 is fixed on the tube 155, each position of the pin 153 in one of the three holes 154 corresponds to a different angle of incidence of the surf 151 with respect to the surface of the water.Preferably the connecting rod 152 is made of an elastically flexible material to act as a shock absorber. Such elastically flexible material can be a composite of glass fibers and resin, such as epoxy resin or like. With reference to Figure 1 the working of the sailing apparatus according to the invention is as follows the regulation of the relative distance from the towing point of the left side of the propulsor with respect to the right side, is operated from the driving vehicle moving the arms of the surfer 22. Such regulation controls the rotation of the propulsor around its vertical axis, as shown by the arrow 75, and automatically allows, by the action of the wind, to change, as wished, the towing direction 9 and to direct both the floats 19 and 20 according to the sailing direction 6. When such relative distance from the towing point 7 is equal both for the left side and for the right side, the towing direction is with aft wind. When the distance from the towing point 7 of one side increases,relatively to the distance of the other side, the towing direction 9 is suitable for sailing close to the wind. Therefore the regulation of the relative distance from the towing point of the left side and of the right side gives rise to two distinct rotations of the propulsor a first rotation, according to arrow 75, around a vertical axis passing through the propulsor itself this first rotation is directly operated acting on the relative length of the guys or on the arms of the surfer a second rotation, around a vertical axis passing through the towing point 7 this second rotation is operated by the wind as an effect of the first rotation. The regulation of the relative distance from the towing point of the lower side of the propulsor with respect to the higher side is operated from the surf 21 moving the handgrips 31 and 32. Such regulation controls the rotation of the propulsor around an horizontal axis of its, as shown by arrow 76,and allows to control the upstanding and the rake of the sailing propulsor. The invention may be utilized on ice or land. A version for ice use has rotatable skids in place of the floats 19 and 20. Similarly, a land apparatus has castor wheels in place of the floats.
