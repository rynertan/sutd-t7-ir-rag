## Description
B Adrenergic antagonist compounds and derivatives of ss adrenergic antagoni s Background of the Invention The 3 adrenergic agonist hormones when bound to plasma membrane adrenergic receptor sites sites produce a broad range of physiological effects such as vasodilation, changes in blood pressure, cardiac stimulation resulting in enhanced cardiac output and rate, increased production of glucose, and initiation of glycogenolysis, etc. These hormones, from a chemical standpoint, are generally classified as catecholamines. That is, they usually possess the characteristic hydroxyl groups substituted at the 3and 4 positions on a benzene ring and an hydroxyethylamine side chain attached to the number 1 position of the benzene ring. This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. HL 26340 awarded by theDepartment of Health and Human Services. TheGovernment has certain rights in this invention. As noted in U.S. Patent 4,337,207 a number of recently developed derivatives of the naturally occurring catecholamine agonist hormones are also capable of producing significant biological and pharmacological effects. Such derivatives include chemically modified and extended hydroxy ethyl amine side chains wherein an alkyl or alkylaryl chain of variable length is added to the amine and terminates in a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid derivative functional grouping. In the past several decades, a group of hormone like molecules has been synthesized that may also bind at the same sites and thereby interfere with, or eliminate, the effects of the ss agonist hormones. These ss adrenergic antagonist molecules also play a useful role in the control of the physiological and pathological processes related to this complex hormonal system. For instance, these antagonists, when administered to a patient can reduce high blood pressure hypotensive , restore regular heart rhythm, reduce myocardial work and therefore myocardial oxygenation i.e., they are antianginal. Like the adrenergic agonist hormones, the Is adrenergic antagonists may act at both so called receptor sites and ss2 receptor sites. The hl receptors are generally associated with heart function e.g. force of contraction while the ss2 receptors are usually associated with bronchial smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. The adrenergic antagonists therefore may be classified as nonselective when they act at both A1 and ,g2 recep tors or cardioselective or ssl selective when they act predominantly at ss1 receptors. In many instances it is desirable to have cardioselective adrenergic antagonists available for therapy. The most common adrenergic antagonists have quite closely related structures that can most often be represented by the general formula EMI2.1 where R1 is an aryl, or substituted aryl group andR2 is most commonly an isopropyl group and in a limited number of cases, t butyl. In a more limited number of cases 4 adrenergic antagonists may be represented by the general formula EMI3.1 where R1 is a substituted aryl group and R2 is generally isopropyl . The most common non selective adrenergic antagonists include propranolol I EMI3.2 R2 CH CH3 2 alprenolol I EMI3.3 R2 CH CH3 2 nadolol I EMI3.4 R2 C CH3 3 oxprenolol I EMI3.5 R2 CH CH3 2 dichloroisoproterenol 11 EMI4.1 R2 CH CH3 2 pindolol I EMI4.2 R2 CH CH3 2 sotalol II EMI4.3 R2 CH CH3 2 and timolol I EMI4.4 R2 C CH3 3.The most common cardioselective 3 adrenergic antagonists include practolol I EMI4.5 R2 CH CH3 2 atenolol I EMI4.6 R2 CH CH2 2 metoprolol I EMI5.1 R2 CH CH3 2 celiprolol I EMI5.2 R2 C CH3 3 and acebutolol I EMI5.3 R2 CH CH3 2 In any event all ss adrenergic antagonists exhibit related adrenergic properties when introduced into the vascular system. While the structures produce qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different pharmacological effects, in some instances, these effects are diverse and general, but, in others, the effects are very specific. These differences often relate to the different selectivities discussed above. It is therefore of Interest to explore the possibility of devising modified ss adrenergic antagonist molecules which will exhibit biological activities similar to those of the parent compounds but which might also exhibit enhanced increased potency , or prolonged in vivo activity or perhaps selective effects which would permit the targeting of the drugs or drug effects to selected receptors, tissues, or cells within tissues on a more selective basis than is possible with the parent molecules or to selected clinical uses wherein the drug effects are narrowed by means of pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic differences from the native drug. It would also be of great interest if structurally modified ss antagonists could be further conjugated with other carrier molecules, e.g., defined peptides or proteins, whereby the conjugate molecules might be degraded less readily by enzymes or greater tissue or receptor specificity might be imparted because of the drug carrier properties. The receptors for the antagonists are located on the outer surface of cell membranes, and the observed biological effect of the attachment of the antagonists to carrier molecules need not be predominantly dependent upon, nor necessarily be complicated by, complex membrane transport phenomena or phagocytosis of a conjugate molecule.It is therefore possible for covalent conjugates of the ss antagonists to reach the receptor sites intact as have their agonist counterparts.Brief Description of the Invention The present invention is directed to chemically modified ss adrenergic antagonist structures wherein the side chain N substituent group is extended by the addition of alkyl or alkylaryl chains of variable length that terminate in a carboxyl group, or more especially, in a substituted amide. These modified, carboxyl containing ss antagonists may be further modified by covalent binding to carrier molecules, e.g., peptides, to form active conjugate molecules. As defined herein, a p antagonist that is chemically modified by extension of the side chain is called a modified ss antagonist. Where the modification, i.e., extended side chain, terminates in a functional grouping, e.g., a carboxylic acid, the molecule is called a p antagonist congener. Where the drug congener is covalently bound to a carrier molecule, e.g., a peptide or protein, the resultant drug carrier molecule is called a drug conjugate or conjugate . The modified ss antagonists or congeners of the invention have the general structure EMI7.1 where R an aryl or substituted aryl moiety, e.g.,EMI7.2 for propanolol,EMI7.3 for practolol, etc. see above R H, CH3, or lower alkyl moiety and Y OH, or more especially, O A X or NH A X, where A alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl moiety and X a terminal grouping such as CH3 or CF3 or CH2 nCOOH, etc. EMI7.4 A X may also be a carrier moiety such as an amino acid or a peptide, e.g,, N acetyl phenylalanyl hydroxypropy lamide, t butyloxycarbonyl phenylalanyl glycyl methylamide, etc. It is therefore a feature of the invention to provide biologically active modifications and congeners, and congener derivatives, such as amides, esters, etc., of ss antagonists. It is another feature of the invention to provide conjugates of adrenergic antagonists. It is another feature of the invention to provide ss adrenergic antagonist modifications and congeners that exhibit adrenergic antagonist activity. It is still another feature of the invention to provide conjugates of adrenergic antagonists that exhibit ss adrenergic antagonist activity. It is still another feature of the invention to provide ss adrenergic derivatives wherein the molecules are chemically modified by extending theN substituent group to an alkyl, or alkylaryl chain of. variable length and terminating in a carboxyl group or derivative such as a substituted ester or amide group. It is yet another feature of the invention to conjugate adrenergic derivatives with peptide carriers. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from a review of the following description and the claims appended hereto.Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to derivatives of 4 adrenergic antagonist drugs that exhibit biological activity, or modification of the ss antagonistic activity of the parent compounds. More specifically the invention relates to j to adrenergic antagonist derivatives wherein the terminalN substituent grouping is modified and extended by the addition of alkyl, or alkylaryl chains of variable length. Such added chains may terminate in a functional group, such as OH, or NH2 or more frequently, in a functional group, such as COOH, or SO3H congener . In certain instances, the j adrenergic congener may, in turn, be covalently bound via the terminal functional group to a carrier molecule, e.g., a peptide or protein, to yield a bioactive conjugate. Generically, the derivatives have the structure EMI9.1 where R EMI9.2 in the case of propranolol andEMI9.3 in the case of practolol, etc. and wherein n indicates the number of methylene groups in the chain, but which is most usually from 1 to perhaps 15 and Y may be either OH, i.e., a carboxylic acid terminal group OAX, i.e.,. an ester wherein A is an alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl moiety, and X is a terminal grouping such as CH3, CF3, CH2 XCOOH, etc. or NH A X, i.e., an amide terminal group, wherein A is an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl moiety and X is a terminal grouping, such as CH3, CF3, CH2x COOH, etc. An acryl amide, i.e., EMI10.1 terminal group is especially useful in yielding biologically interesting derivatives. In some instances, the derivative may be covalently coupled to a carrier moiety through the functional terminal group to form a drug conjugate. If properly selected, the terminal functional group is utilized to connect to the carrier moiety. Completely defined peptides or proteins are especially useful in forming conjugate derivatives, since the biological effect of each amino acid component on the drug conjugate potency and resistance to catabolic breakdown will be more easily ascertained. The preparation of drug conjugates will be more fully explained hereinafter. While it is indicated that the added constituents consist of a spacer moiety and a terminal grouping, it should be noted that the spacer moiety may be a carbon chain that may be straight or branched and may include aryl groupings, or mixed alkylaryl groupings. The important criterion is the retention or enhancement of antagonist activity. In any event, however the inclusion of a series of methylene groups, i.e., CR2 n appears to favor the retention of Bantagonist activity. In the case of the congeners or modified ss antagonists, it is of equal importance that the added N substituent grouping be terminated in a carboxyl functional grouping, i.e., COOH or in a derivative such as an amide, i.e., CO NH R generally where R can be H a primary amide or a variety or alkyl or aryl groups as outlined below. Such terminal amides may be derived from aromatic amines such as aniline and aniline derivatives, e.g , p toluidine EMI11.1 p trifluoromethyl aniline,EMI11.2 and the amino hydrocinnamic acid derivative,EMI11.3 or from aliphatic amines which may be straight chain or branched, e.g.n butylamine, t butylamine, etc.Methods for Synthesizing the Derivatives The A antagonists derivatives having the structure III EMI11.4 can be synthesized by alkylation reactions, such as reductive amination of an appropriate methyl ketone derivative II , i.e.,EMI11.5 by the compound EMI11.6 The reductive aminationEMI11.7 is ieffected by the use of NaBH3CN as the reducing agent with methanol as solvent for the reaction compounds or by catalytic hydrogenation utilizing PtO H2 in acetic acid. Schematically this synthesis may be depicted as EMI12.1 where R may be EMI12.2 propranolol EMI12.3 practolol , etc. The methyl ketone derivatives IV can be synthesized for use in the reductive amination step above by a condensation of the appropriate ketoacid with a suitable amine derivative using the mixed anhydride method. This synthesis may be depicted as EMI12.4 IV, Y NH R X It should be noted that while aromatic amides are preferred aliphatic amides are also useful for this synthesis. Compounds of the general formula V above may be prepared by the following reactions EMI13.1 The group R, which is generally an aryl or substituted aryl moiety, may be derived from a commercially available material or may be synthesized from commercially available tarting materials. Thus, the propranolol precursor V, R l naphthyl may be synthesized from 1 naphthol as starting material the synthesis of the precursor for alprenolol congeners utilizes 2 allylphenol the pindolol precursor utilizes 4 hydroxyindole, etc.Other P antagonist congener precursors may require more complex syntheses. For example, the derivative V , corresponding to the practolol precursor, may be prepared by the following reactions EMI14.1 EMI15.1 The antagonist derivatives may be purified by conventional purification techniques, such as crystallization, or by chromatographic techniques, such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography or flash cfiromatography may also be used. Such techniques will yield contaminant free antagonist derivatives. Examples The following examples set forth specific procedures for the preparation of a number of modified ss antagonists, 4 antagonist congeners, and congener derivatives in accordance with the invention.1,2 Epoxy 3 l Naphthyloxy Propane Compound X, R l naphthyl To a solution of ss naphthol 86.09g. 0.5 mol and epichlorohydrin 54.6 ml, 0.7 mol in 200 ml dioxane was added a solution of sodium hydroxide 24.0g, 0.6 mol in 50 ml water. The mixture was ref fluxed for 3 hr during which time sodium chloride precipitated out. The dioxane was evaporated in vacuo and the remaining aqueous solution extracted twice with chloroform. The combined organic fractions were then washed twice with brine and dried over sodium sulfate.After removing the drying agent by filtration, the chloroform was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residual oil showed.a major product with only two very minor impurities by thin layer chromatography 95 5 3 chloroform methanol acetic acid, Rf 0.78 and so was not purified further.

Upon cooling, the mixture crystallized to a solid mass which was filtered and washed with chloroform and ether. The light brown solid was boiled in 400 ml ethanol and filtered hot.The insoluble tan material was identified by thin layer chromatography to be almost pure product. Upon cooling more product crystallized from the filtrate. These crops were combined and recrystallied from ethanol to give 21 g of light tan crystals that were homogenous by thin layer chromatography 95 5 3 chloroform metha nol acetic cid, Rf 0.65 m.p. 152 154 C.1 Amino 3 1 Naphthyloxy Propan 2 ol Hydrochloride Compound V, R R 1 naphthyl Sydrazine hydrate 2.8g 56 mmol was dissolved in 100 ml ethanol in a flask which had been flushed with nitrogen.

After completing the addition the mixture was warmed gently on a hot plate and within a few minutes the solution became very thick. Ethanol 800 ml was added and beating was continued for 3 hr. The hydrazine intermediate was destroyed by the dropwise addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid until all the precipitated material dissolved. Upon cooling of the mixture in an ice bath, the phthalylhydrazide precipitated and was separated from the product by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to a white mass which was partially dissolved in water and extracted three time. with chloroform.The aqueous phase was then lyophilized and the. residue crystallized from ethanol ether to yield 9g of white crystals which were shown to be nomoquenous by thir layer chromatography 50 10 5 chloroform methanol acetic acid, Rf 0.39 m.p. 201 C decorn. 1,2 EDCXV 3 p Nitrophenoxy Propans Compound XIV p Nitrophenol 139g, 1.0 mol was dissolved in 1.5 1 0.8 M sodium hydroxide.

After cooling to room temperature, this solution was filtered to yield 9.6g additional product giving an overall yield of 79.5g.The two batches of crystals werr combined and triturated with 300 ml boiling ethanol for 1 hr, then filtered hot to give 65.8g of the desire material which was homogeneous by TLC 95 5 chloroform methanol acetic acid, P 0.54 r.W. 173 176 C.3 p Acetamidophenoxy 1 Phthalimidopropan 2 ol Compound XVII Compound XV 5.0g, 14.6 mmol was hydrogenated in 200 ml ethanol and 50 ml 1N hydrocholoric acid on a Parr hydrogenation apparatus at 50 psi with 50 mg 10E palladium on carbon as catalyst.Although the starting material was fairly insoluble in this system, thin layer chromatography showed the absence of starting material after 8 hr. Since the product was also insoluble in the system, the entire mixture was evaporated to dryness, the residue redissolved in 50 50 methanol dimethylacetamide, and filtered through a Celite pad. Evaporation of the filtrate gave oily crystals which were triturated with hot ethanol. Filtration and drying gave 3.5g of compound XVI which was homogenous by thin layer chromatography 50 10 5 chloroform methanol acetic acid, Rf 0.79 . Compound XVI 0.5g, 1.43 mmol was suspended in 50 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and the flask flushed with nitrogen. Triethylamine 0.6 ml, 4.29 mmol was added and the mixture cooled to 0 C in an ice bath. Acetyl chloride 0.25 ml, 3.58 mmol was dissolved in 25 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and added dropwise to the above solution via addition funnel.After 1 hr. the mixture was evaporated to dryness, the residue dissolved in 50 ml water plus enough tetrahydrofuran to achieve the dissolution and ethyl acetate added until phase separation occurred. The layers were separated and the organic phase washed twice with 25 ml 1N hydrochloric acid and twice with 25 ml brine. After drying the organic phase over magnesium sulfate for 15 min,, filtration and evaporation of the filtrate left a light yellow residue which was crystallized from ethanol water to give 0.28g of the title compound as tan, fluffy crystals which were homogeneous by TLC 95 5 3 chloroform methanol acetic acid, Rf 0.32 m.p. 200 202 C decomp. l Amino 3 p Acetamidonhenoxy Propan 2 ol Hydrochloride Compound V, R p acetamidophenyl Hydrazine hydrate 3.6g, 0.071 mol was dissolved in 50 ml ethanol and added slowly to a suspension of Compound XVII 25g, 0.071 mol in 300 ml boiling ethanol. After 30 min., all the material dissolved. The temperature of the reaction mixture was reduced to 750C and maintained for an additional 1.5 hr. At the end of this time, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated hydrochloric acid added dropwise to pH 1 pH paper to destroy the hydrazide intermediate. Since not all of the material dissolved, the mixture was filtered to remove undissolved phthalhydrazide and the filtrate stored at 40C overnight. Filtration of the newly precipitated material gave 10.6g of the title compound m.p. 192 197 C.

The conjuaates of ,6 antaaonists The present invention also contemplates the preparation of conjugates linking the functionalized antagonist drug congener , e.g., a propranolol or practolol derivative, etc. to a carrier molecule, e.g., a peptide or protein, by covalent bonds. A functional spacer is utilized for covalent linkage to the drug and to the carrier, yet it does not interfere with the pharmacological properties of the drug. It also provides a chemically stable linkage with the carrier and facilitates good yields of the conjugate. The conjugates of the invention may be most easily conceptualized from the following EMI37.1 tb SEP A SEP C SEP B tb SEP I tb PEPTIDEX tb CARRIER SEP t SEP yw tb SEP F tb SEP CONGENER SEP SEP F tb SEP I tb SEP Drug tb SEP COUPLING SEP REACTION tb SEP Y SEP Y tb CONJUGATE SEP i SEP X NH CH CO SEP NH CH CO SEP NH CH CO bXI tb SEP Z tb SEP S tb SEP DRUG tb where S is a schematic representation of the spacer group attached to the drug F is a schematic representation of the functional group attached to the spacer, where Drug S F comprises the congener F is a schematic representation of a functional group attached to the carrier side chain, Y , of the amino acid residue to which the congener is bound in the conjugate and wherein the functional group F is reactive with functional group F Z is a schematic representation of the reacted groups F and Fl or chemical bond whereby the congener is bound to the carrier A,B are oligopeptide blocks wherein the amino acid residues are the same, or different with predesigned sequences C is an amino acid residue to which the congener is bound X is an amine blocking group, or H X is a carboxyl blocking group, or H Y is a general amino acid residue side chain Y is a side chain on the amino acid residue to which the congener is bound a b a b a or b can be O, or any small integer and m 1,2,3, etc. As will be apparent from the general structure above, the drug is bound via a spacer S and reacted functional group moiety, Z, to the C amino acid residue side chain Y of the carrier peptide A C B.The carrier consists of a monodisperse peptide i.e.one whose sequence and chemical structure are completely defined wherein blocks A and B may be homo oligopeptide blocks, i.e., wherein the amino acid residues are identical, or alternately, several different amino acid residues in a predetermined sequence. A particular amino acid residue, C, is located at a predetermined position in the peptide chain. Amino acid residue, C, which consists of a single amino acid residue, is selected to be reactive with the particular congener to be attached to the carrier. It should also be understood that the peptide carrier blocks A, B and C may be linked with homologous blocks A, B and C to form carrier peptides of increasingly greater molecular weights, e.g., A C B m A C Bln, where m 1,2,3, etc. and m n n 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. and where the sequence of blocksA, B, and C in the peptide chain may be of any desired order. Furthermore, it should be understood that, when carriers of increasing molecular weight are used, not all of the potential sites of attachment for drug molecules amino acid residue C , need be derivatized with drug. It should also be understood that peptide blocks A C B may be linked to a defined peptide sequence D, such as a naturally occurring peptide or protein. Thus any desired molecular weight or sequence of monodisperse peptides may be utilized as the carrier moiety of the conjugate. It should also be understood that the carrier may consist of a single blocked amino acid residue, C, alone. Selection of the number of amino acid residues and their identity will be discussed hereinafter.Generally speaking, however, carrier moieties having molecular weights in the range of 2X10 to 104 daltons seem to be most suited for maintaining the rapid onset of biological activity in vivo. SNonetheless carrier molecular weights of 10 daltons or greater are also contemplated for use in the conjugates of this invention. Naturally occurring monodisperse peptides are also contemplated for use as carriers for drugs in the manner already described for synthetic, monodisperse carriers. Thus, peptide hormones and proteins are useful in this context since they naturally contra functional groups e.g., amine or carboxyl groups provided by the side chains of their constituent amino acids. Antibodies, especially monoclonal antibodies, are particualrly useful as carriers for drugs since, because of their specificity for particular cells, they can be used to target the drugs and thereby optimize the activity of the drug while minimizing or eliminating side effects. The spacer moiety may include an alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkenyl, polyenyl group, etc. so long as said group does not interfere with the coupling of the congener to the carrier. It is also advantageous that the spacer group incorporate a branched chain immediately adjacent to the amine group of the drug.The spacer moiety must be capable of covalently bonding to the terminal end of the amine side chain of the drug while also being capable of covalently bonding to the reactive group of the carrier molecule. The spacer moiety attached to the drug may be any group as noted above. The initial end of the spacer moiety must be capable of covalently bonding to the terminal end of the amine side chain of the drug while its terminal end must be bonded to a functional group, which group must, in turn, be capable of covalent bonding to side chain Y , of the carrier amino acid residue, C. The functional group terminal end is chosen to be complementary to the functional group terminating side chain, Y of the carrier amino acid residue, C. Thus if residue C side chain contains an amine functional grouping, e.g., lysine or p aminophenylalanine, the terminal functional grouping of the attached functional group may be a carboxyl, a sulfonic acid, etc. The number of drug congeners per conjugate molecule may be one, or any number greater than one.Wherever an amino acid residue, C, is placed within the carrier structure a drug congener may be attached thereto. The greater the number ofthe C amino acid residues present in the carrier the greater the number of drug congeners that may be attached. The spacing between the drug congeners on any conjugate molecule may also be controlled by the spacing of the C amino acid residues on the carrier blocks or, as noted above, by the inclusion of C amino acid residues which are not derivatized with the drug. Thus the size and sequence of the oligopeptide blocks A and B note the variables a and b in the general structure diagram above will determine the spacings between the C peptide residues and thus the spacings between the attached drug congeners.Similarly, the sequence in which the oligopeptide blocks A, B and C are present in the carrier molecule will also determine the distances between attached drug congeners. Similarly, when naturally occurring, monodisperse peptides are used as carriers, although the sites of attachment may remain constant, because of the defined sequence of the peptide or protein, the number of drug molecules per carrier molecule may be controlled through the stoichiometry used during the coupling reaction. The amino acid residues in the synthetic peptide carrier molecule may be present either in theL form or in the D form, or as a mixture of both forms.Incorporation of D amino acid residues into the carrier increases proteolytic resistance of the conjugates in vivo. Increased proteolytic resistance should also affect the duration of the effect of the attached drug. Generally, the conjugates of the invention are synthesized by one of two routes. The first method involves the preparation of appropriate congeners wherein the extended amino side chain of the drug has a suitable spacer moiety terminated in a functional group added to the amino end of the drug. The functionalized drug i.e. , the congener, is then, in turn, coupled to the side chain Y of the C amino acidresidue in the carrier peptide. The second method of synthesis involves the initial adification of the carrier peptide by coupling title spacer functional group moiety directly to the side chain, Y , of the C amino acid residue.The result .. peptide functional group spacer is then coupled direcrly to the p antagonis , for example, by a reductie animation reaction to produce the peptide drug conjugate. The structure and preparation of conjugates of the antagonists ray be understood by reference to a specific series of snouisperse conjugates wherein propanolol and practolol congeners or congeners of other ss blocking molecules the drugs are linked to monodisperse peptides the carrier to provide ss antagonist conjugates. The synthesis of the conjugates is accomplished by any of several routes wherein 1 the drug molecule is first modified to produce a congener thereof as noted above. The modification of the drug to form the congener comprises linking the desired spacer grouping to the drug.The spacer grouping is terminated by a functional group which is then linked to a suitable amino acid residue on the carrier molecule or 2 the carrier molecule has the spacer grouping linked to a predetermined amino acid residue in the carrier peptide chain and the drug molecule is then alloyed to react with the functionalized carrier to form the desired conjugate, The second route is generally preferred in the case of small synthetic carriers because of increased yields and a decreased chance of degrading the pharmacophore portion of the drug during conjugate formation However, in the case of naturally occurring peptide carriers, such as peptide hormones and proteins, the first route may be preferred because of the potential sensitivity of the carrier to degradation or decomposition including denaturation during the linking reaction of the drug to the prefunctionalized carrier in route 2 . The second method involves first attaching a keto acid to the carrier peptide. The functionalized peptic carrier is then lined to the drug by reductive amination. More specifically and for purposes of illustration, a simple conjugate i.e., propranolol linked to a single amino acic e.g. p aminophenylalanine may be considered. In this illustration the alpha amine and carboxylic acid ends of p aminophenylalanine are blocked by acetyl and 3 hydroxypropylamide groups respectively, The 3 hydroxypropylamide group enhances water solubility of the resultant conjugate. In the actual procedure the amino acid, p nitrophenylalanine is first converted to the N acetyl methyl ester derivative in two steps. One of two alternate methods may be used. In the first of these, esterification is carried out by the method disclosed by Guttman and Boissonnas in Helv. Chim. Acta. 41, 1852 1867 1958 followed by pyridine catalyzed acetylation. In the second method, the amino acid is first acetylated with acetic anhydride in cold, aqueous base without racemization by the procedure as set forth by Yoshida and Ishii in J. Biol. Chem. 71, 185 191 1972 . The N acetyl p nitrophenylalanine is then esterified by diazomethane. The N acetyl methyl ester derivative, either in the L or D form is then converted to the 3 hydroxypropylamide by aminolysis with excess of 3 amino 1 propanol. The methyl ketone functional grouping is attached to the acetyl amino acid hydroxypropylamide derivative by catalytic reduction of the nitro group followed by coupling to a keto acid such as 6 oxo n heptanoic acid. The methyl ketone functionalized amino acid carrier molecule is then subjected to catalytic reductive amination with nor propranolol Compound V, R l naphthyl in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to yield the propranolol amino acid conjugate. The resultant conjugate is purified by utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography or other chromatographic methods. Similar techniques to those outlined above, may be utilized to prepare conjugates of the antagonists with carrier molecules having multiple amino acid residues forming the peptide. Several of such preparations are set forth in the examples hereinbelow.Preparation of Peptide Carriers The following examples illustrate the various methods which may be used for producing monodisperse peptide carriers.p Nitro L Phenylalanine Methyl Ester Hydrochloride Compound 1 Thionyl chloride distilled, 0.69 ml, 9.5 mmol was added dropwise to methanol 20 ml at 10 C p Nitro L phenylalanine 1.00 g, 4.76 mmol was added and the solution stirred 24 hours at room temperature.After evaporating to dryness, the residue was recrystallized from methanoljether to give 1.00g of a white solid melting at 218 219 OC. r 25 11.50 c 0.9, H2O .
