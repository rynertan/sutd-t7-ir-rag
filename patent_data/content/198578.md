# Dual polarised sinuous antennas.

## Abstract
A sinuous antenna is disclosed having N identically and generally sinuous arms 11 extending outwardly from a common axis 12 and arranged symmetrically on a surface at intervals of 360 N about the central axis. Each antenna arm comprises cells of bends and curves with each cell being interleaved without contact between adjacent cells of an adjacent antenna arm.
