# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FUEL CONTROL IN FUEL INJECTED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are disclosed for controlling fuel flow from a fuel source to the fuel rail of a fuel injected, internal combustion engine. Two fuel flow paths are con nected in parallel between the source and the fuel rail, an on off solenoid valve being provided in each of the fuel flow paths. The two solenoid valves have dissimilar fuel flow capacities. A microcomputer generates a pulse width mod ulated signal for application to a slected one of the two solenoid valves so as to control fuel flow through the asso ciated fuel flow path. The microcomputer decides to which solenoid valve to apply the pulse width modulated signal and the duty cycle of the pulse width modulated signal in accordance with the value of a master variable. The master variable is adjusted in accordance with the difference be tween vehicle or engine speed and an associated limit, thereby providing vehicle or engine speed governing. The system is also operable in cruise control and variable engine speed governing modes.
