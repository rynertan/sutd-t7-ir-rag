# Rotary distribution tables.

## Abstract
A distributing table construction in a combinatorial weighing apparatus includes a conical main table 61 mounted on a vibrator 7 and slanted at a relatively small angle for distributing and supplying article to be weighed such as pieces of cheese or jelly into a number of radial troughs, and a smaller diameter conical subtable 62 dis posed over the conical main table and connected thereto by a bolt 24 , the conical subtable being slanted at an angle larger than the small angle of the conical main table. The conical subtable is adjustable in height by the bolt and a weld nut 21 threaded thereover and attached to the subtable. The conical subtable serves to supply articles from an article charger easily onto the main table and allow the supplied articles to be deposited sufficiently on the main table so that the articles can stably be supplied to the radial troughs.
