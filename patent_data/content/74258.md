# Improved process for flue gas desulfurization.

## Abstract
Spent absorbents resulting from desulfurization of flue gas in a spray drying absorption process contain substantial amounts of sulfite, e.g. calcium sulfite. Said sulfite is oxidized into sulfate by heating of the spent absorbent in the presence of an oxygen containing gas, preferably at temper atures of 350 600 C. Thereby the spent absorbents may be converted into materials having industrial utility.
