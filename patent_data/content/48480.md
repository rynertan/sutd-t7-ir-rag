# Semiconductor photoelectric converter.

## Abstract
A semiconductor imager comprises a first and a second region 41, 42 which have a conductivity type opposite to a substrate 21 and are reversedly biassed relative to the substrate beneath photosensitive regions 22 of each row and a reading device 26, 33 for the row, respectively, to be completely and not to be completely depleted, respectively. The imager may or may not comprise such a covering region 77 on each photosensitive region as may have the conduc tivity type of the first and the second regions and be not completely depleted. It is possible to provide a line sensor or a photodiode of a similar structure, preferably, the first and the second regions have a common impurity concentration lower than the photosensitive regions and are thinner and thicker relative to each other. The covering region preferably has an impurity concentration of each channel stopper 23 .
