# Multi layer semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A multi layer semiconductor device comprising a stacked wafer body 7 consisting of a plurality of sets 4 of two semiconductor wafers 1 and a heat sink plate 3 interposed therebetween, an end of the heat sink plate 3 of each set 4 of wafers being exposed at at least one of the side surfaces of the stacked wafer body 7 , there being an intermediate connecting circuit 8 provided for connecting circuits in each set of wafers 4 , the intermediate connecting circuit 9 being provided on at least one side surface other than the surface at which the ends of the heat skin plates 3 are exposed.
