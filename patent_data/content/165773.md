# Cascaded fiber optic lattice filter.

## Abstract
A fiber optic lattice filter having a transfer function wherein the poles and zeros are adjustable independently of each other. The filter comprises a cascaded configuration of recursive 100 and non recursive 102 fiber optic lattice filters. In one preferred embodiment, an all pass fiber optic filter is formed by cascading all pole and all zero lattice filters, and by processing the resulting filtered output signal in a subtractive detection system 104 . This detection system produces a signal which represents the difference between two signal outputs provided by the all zero filter section, and which is adjustable in magnitude, thereby providing an overall filtering function which is capable of handling both positive and negative valued input signals.
