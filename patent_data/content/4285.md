# A method of plasma etching silica at a faster rate than silicon in an article comprising both.

## Abstract
A method of plasma etching silica at a faster rate than silicon in an article containing both silica and silicon involves using a gaseous mixture containing an unsaturated halocarbon and a saturated halocarbon. The preferred halocarbons contain fluorine. A preferred embodiment is a gaseous mixture containing C₃F₆ and C₂F₆.
