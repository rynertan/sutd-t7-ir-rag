# Apparatus for drying hair with rotating heat sources.

## Abstract
The equipment is for the drying of hair and is applicable to commercial hairdressing establishments rather than for domestic use. It reduces windage noise level associated with movement of the heat source, such as to ensure the effective heating of every part of the head. A number of quartz lamps fitted with infra red filters are mounted by adjustable and lockable pivots to an elliptical tubular support which can rotate wrt. the axis of the connecting rods to which the lamps are attached. Power for regular rotation of the lamps is derived from a motorised gear unit. Power to the moving lamps is taken via a set of slip rings located in the body.

Apparatus for drying hair as claimed in the preceding claims, wherein said lamps 2 may have a fan incorporated, so heat emission may be accompanied by air flow, as needed in some cases.

## Description
Apparatus for drying hair with rotating heat sourcesThis invention concerns an apparatus for drying hair, mainly for use by hairdressers and the like, equipped with rotating heat sources.Hairdressers currently dry hair and fix various preparations by using hot air hair dryers which are annoying and uncomfortable for many subjects in that they surround the entire head, are noisy and require long exposure times as well.A current alternative involves the use of several infrared heat lamps to be oriented maunally around the head.These obviously require careful placement and continuous changes in position, and at the same time do not give uniform heat distribution, but rather localized application. This is annoying and leads to unavoidable dead spots.The aim of this invention is to realize a completely automatic apparatus which uniformly distributes the electrically produced heat so as to shorten exposure times.This aim is achieved with a device consisting of a circular, or any other shape, tubular support with two or more adjustable infrared lamps on hinges placed symmetrically along its edge, with said support joined, via two possibly adjustable rods or the like, along its axis to an electric motor with reducer, which gives rise to continuous and timed rotation and allows the axis of rotation of the support to be moved in space, via a cam or similar device, in a type of nutation, so as to allow said lamps to reach every point of the head underneath with their heat emission.The electric motor with reducer is connected, at an ad justable angle with respect to one or more mounts which in turn slide telescopically, so that its height may be regulated, to a support resting on the floor, which may be equipped with small wheels for moving it in this way, the lamps may be placed very precisely so as to cover any dead spots during operation.A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in the attached drawings, showing figure 1, an axonometric view figure 2, details of the cam connection between motor and support figure 3, the nutation motion in space figure 4, the sliding electric contact figure 5, a possible electric scheme.The figures show in detail the circular, elliptical or other shape support 1, with 2, 3 or more quarz lamps attached and infrared red filters 2, adjustable and lockable with pivots 3 so as to concentrate and localize the heat emitted said support can also be rotated with respect to the axis passing through connection rods 4, which rotate joined with shaft 5 of the motor and reducer 4 and so are moved by sliding spring pivot 7 in the groove or cam 8 so as to achieve the various movements in space shown with exemplifying positions A, B and C of the nutation of support 1 and so of lamps2, which cover a rotational ellipse around the user s head.Body 9 of the container for motor 6 can in turn be adjusted by rotating it around itx axis on horizontal piv ot 10, with respect to sliding telescopic mounts II and 12, which may be fixed with device 17 at variable heights with respect to bearing structure 18.The control unit 13 supplies current to motor 6 via wire 14 as well as, through the sliding contact established with ring like plates 15 and electrodes 16, to lamps 2 said lamps, as mentioned above, rotate with respect to body 9 of the container, joined to said mounts 11, 12.In ooerational variants, the lamps 2 may rotate continuously or for timed periods or may be left in a fixed position, as a function of the controls at unit 13, equipped with general switch IG, double switch D1 able to exclude the timer, with switch IT and motor MT, for the lamps 2 , switch D2 to exclude the motor 6 from the timer, current adjustor VL for the light intensity, and warning lights L1, L2 and L3, relating respectively to the timer in direct operation, the central motor, and the general motor.Operation of the apparatus according to this invention is obvious lamps 2 are positioned via pivots 3, the inclination of support 1 with respect to the axis of rods 4, body 9 of the container with respect to pivot 10, and the height of mounts 11 and 12 with respect to base 18. Motor 6 is placed in operation so that lamps 2 follow their spatial trajectory and cover any dead spot to be heated. In one variation said quartw lamps 2 with infrared filters may be replaced with non luminous infrared resistances or with normal lamps with red covers.Moreover, circular or elliptical support 1 may even be eliminated by securing sald lamps 2 directly to rods 4 even in greater numbers i.e., more than 2 or to a transverse rod, while container 9 may contain loudspeakers for music or the like.Said lamps 2 may have a fan incorporated, so heat emission may be accompanied by air flow, as needed in some cases.
