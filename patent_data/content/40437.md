# Method of manufacturing magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for manufacturing a magnetic recording medium using vacuum deposition from an evapo rated metal source having a very high efficiency and uniform deposition. The support W onto which the magnetic film is to be evaporated is guided and conveyed along a curved path above a molten metal evaporating source 1, 2 at a substan tially constant speed. The curved path is shaped such that evaporated metal flow lines connecting a central point on the evaporation surface of the molten metal in the evaporating source 1, 2 to corresponding intersection points on the sup port W form the same angle of incidence with respect to the longitudinal direction of the support W for all positions along the support W where the film is to be deposited. Endless belt structures 11, 11 including guide rollers and magnets 13, 13 are used to form rising and falling paths for conveying the support along the desired curved path.
