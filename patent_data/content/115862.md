# Exhaust gas recirculation control method and apparatus for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A valve 20 determines the effective diamter of an exhaust gas recirculation passage 10 . A position sensor 30 provides a signal representing the actual position b of the valve, and an actuator 40 positions the valve 20 . A target value a for the valve is set according to predetermined operating conditions of the engine. The actuator 40 is driven with a drive pulse corresponding to a positional deviation between the target value a and the actual position b of the valve as represented by the signal provided by the position sensor 30 . After driving the actuator 40 with one such drive pulse, the generation of the next subsequent drive pulse is inhibited by a pause unit 75 for a predetermined period of time.
