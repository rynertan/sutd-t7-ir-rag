## Abstract
The invention relates to compositions suitable for form ing a film by a bubble extrusion process comprising a blend of a pelletized linear low density polyethylene containing from 0 to about 15 mol percent of a comonomer of a mono olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, 0 to about 20 mol percent of a pelletized low density polyethylene, 20 to 25 mol percent of a powdery linear low density polyethylene containing from 0 to about 15 mol percent of a comonomer of a mono olefin having fom 3 to 12 carbon atoms and 1 to 10 mol percent of a liquid polyolefin.
