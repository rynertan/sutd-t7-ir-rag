# Method of scrubbing flue gases.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of removing sulfur dioxide from flue gases derived from furnaces burning high sulfur content fuels. The method comprises contacting, e.g. by spraying, flue gases with an aqueous medium containing i a material either dissolved or slurried therein, which material reacts with the sulfur dioxide in the flue gas to produce calcium sulfate and calcium sulfite, and ii a composition comprising a substantially linear water soluble sulfonated polystyrene, and an organo phosphonic acid derivative having the structural formula X ₂N R N X ₂ where R is a lower alkyl of from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, X is hydrogen or the group CH₂PO₃M₂, wherein M is a water soluble cation, the compound being further characterized in that at least one but preferably all X s are CH₂PO₃M₂. In certain instances it is desirable to use in conjunction with the invention a water soluble lignosulfonate.
