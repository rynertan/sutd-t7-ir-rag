# SEGMENTED CORONODE SCOROTRON

## Abstract
A segmented coronode scorotron charging device 90 comprising a coronode wire 92 that is zig zagged with respect to the direction of travel of a charge receptor in order to reduce the effective distance between hot spots in the wire and thereby insure uniform charging of the receptor, and to reduce the length of coronode wire between support points, thereby eliminating sagging, singing, and tensioning problems and providing a scorotron of unlimited length.
