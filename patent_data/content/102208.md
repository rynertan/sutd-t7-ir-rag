# Curable epoxy resin compositions and methods of curing them especially for preparing formed, shaped, filled bodies.

## Abstract
Curable epoxy resin compositions comprise a mixture of an acid curable epoxy resin and a minor amount of an oxidizing agent capable of reacting with sulphur dioxide to form a catalyst for curing said epoxy resin. The composition may further contain solid particulate materials. Sand cores and moulds produced in accordance with the method have sufficient strength and hardness after a few seconds of curing for normal foundry applications.
