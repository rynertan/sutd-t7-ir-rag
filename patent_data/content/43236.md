# Container constructions.

## Abstract
A bag in the box construction comprising an inner con tainer 12 in the form of a flexible bag, an outer container 10 in the form of a cardboard or corrugated board box, and a tap 14 for dispensing from the inner container. The tap 14 is welded or otherwise secured to the bag 12 and, when the bag is packed into the box 10 , part of the tap 14 is pulled through an opening 134 in the box so that this part 74 lies outside the box. The box is formed with a pane 132 bounded by a perforated line, the opening being in this panel. When it is desired to dispense the contents of the bag, the part 74 of the tap which is external of the box 10 is gripped and pulled so that the remainder of the tap 14 bears against the inside face of the panel 132 . The panel 132 eventually tears away and the tap 14 can then be pulled through the resulting aperture.

## Description
CONTAINER CONSTRUCTIONS THIS INVENTION relates to container constructions. The bag in the box concept, i.e. the concept of using a flexible, liquid impervious inner container and a more rigid outer container, has over the past few years been widely used in the packaging industries of a number of countries in the world. This type of construction appears to have originated some 20 years ago and three separate approaches can be identified from the prior art. These are 1 An arrangement in which the inner container with the tap attached thereto is simply placed in the outer container. The outer container has a panel in the wall thereof bounded by a perforated line. To bring the tap to its dispensing position, i.e. a position in which it projects outwardly from the outer container, the panel is removed from the outer container and the tap pulled through. This construction has the disadvantage that, if the tap is not properly positioned by the packer or moves during shipping, it is difficult to gain access to it through the relatively small panel that has been removed.2 An arrangement in which a tap connector is secured to both the inner and outer containers. The tap connector is sealed by a frangible diaphragm and the tap itself is located loosely in the box. The box must be partly opened to enable access to be had to the tap. Once the tap has been found it is removed from the box and pushed into the tap connector. The frangible diaphragm is punctured by this action and thereafter the tap can be used to dispense liquid from the inner container. A significant disad vantage of this arrangement is that the inner container almost completely fills the outer container and conforms to the shape thereof. Consequently, difficulties are encountered in finding the tap when it is not positioned immediately adjacent the opening in the outer container, and in actually manipulating it out of the outer container once it has been found.3 An arrangement in which the tap, which is secured to the inner container, projects permanently through the wall of the outer container. This construction is by far the least favourable of the three. The reason for this is that the projecting taps stop the outer containers from being placed close to one another in an outer carton, on a pallet, etc. Thus, there is a great deal of wasted space between outer containers with taps of this construction. Also, the taps are prone to damage during storage and shipping. It is not thought that such a construction has ever achieved the stage of commercial production even though it is to be found proposed in the art. An object of the present invention is to provide a bag in the box construction in which the tap is readily available to the end user but does not project from the outer container to an extent such that boxes placed side by side have a significant gap between them. To this end, the present invention rovides a container construction comprising an outer container having a detachabe panel in the wall thereof and an opening in said panel, a flexible inner container within the outer container, the flexible inner container having a connector secured thereto, and a tap attached to said connector and including an operating element by means of which the tap can be opened and closed, a gripping element, and an outlet through which the contents of the inner container can flow when the tap is open, the tap passing through said opening with the gripping element externally of the outer container and the operating element and outlet within the outer container. In one constructional form, the tap of the container construction comprises a tap body incorporating a resiliently flexible diaphragm, said diaphragm normally closing the tap outlet and carrying said operating element, said element enabling said diaphragm to be distorted to open said outlet, and said gripping element being constituted by a head which is at the end of a projecting stem, said stem passing through said opening with the head externally of the outer container. In another constructional form, said tap comprises first and second co axial, relatively rotatable parts each having an aperture therein, rotation of said parts causing said apertures to move into and out of register thereby to open and close the tap, one of said parts being attached to said connector and the other of said parts being integral with said gripping element. In yet another constructional form, said tap comprises a tap body attached to said connector, the tap body having a surface forming a valve seat, a valve closure member, means resiliently urging the valve closure member against said valve seat, a valve operating member for lifting said valve closure member from the valve seat, and a body cover fitted to said body to enclose said valve operating member, said valve operating member protruding through an aperture in said body cover, and said gripping element being part of said body cover. The outer container can include a front wall and a base, said panel being in said front wall and said opening being constituted by the upper part of a T shaped slot, the upright of the T extending downwardly to the lower edge of the outer container, and the cross bar of said slot being in the base of the container. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic vertical section through a tap and part of a container construction Figure 2 is a front view taken in the direction of the arrow A in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a diametral section through a connector Figure 4 is an end elevation of the connector of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a vertical section through a tap body Figure 6 is a rear elevation of the tap body of Figure 5 Figure 7 is a vertical section through a body cover Figures 8 and 9 are respectively a side elevation and a front elevation of a valve operating member Figures 10 and 11 are a top plan view and an end elevation respectively of a valve closure element Figure 12 illustrates a resilient ring Figures 13 and 14 are a vertical section and a front elevation respectively of a safety and locking device Figure 15 is a section, to an enlarged scale, on the lineXV XV of Figure 14 Figure 16 illustrates part of a blank for an outer container Figure 17 illustrates the tap of Figure 1 in a different operative condition Figure 18 is an elevation taken in the direction of the arrow B in Figure 17 Figures 19 and 20 are respectively a diametral section and a front elevation of another form of tap for a container construction Figure 21 is a diagrammatic vertical section through a further tap and container construction Figure 22 is a view in the direction of arrow C of Figure 21, the tap and container construction being shown partly broken away Figures 23 and 24 are respectively a front elevation and a vertical section, partly in elevation, through a tap body Figures 25 and 26 are respectively an end elevation and a side elevation, partly in section, of a plug Figure 27 is a diametral section through a safety and locking device Figure 28 is a vertical section, partly in elevation, and illustrates a rotatable element of the tap Figure 29 is a front elevation of the element of Figure 28, the element being shown partly broken away Figure 30 illustrates part of an outer container Figure 31 illustrates the tap of Figure 21 in a different operative condition and Figure 32 is an elevation taken in the direction of arrowD of Figure 31. Referring firstly to Figures 1 and 2, an outer container of a container construction is shown at 10, this being in the form of a box of cardboard or corrugated boad.The portion of the outer container 10 shown in Figure 1 is the lower part of the front wall. An inner container of the container construction is shown at 12, this being in the form of a flexible bag which is intended to contain a liquid such as wine. A tap generally indicated at 14 joins the inner container to the outer container. The tap 14 comprises a connector 16 see also Figures 3 and 4 which includes a sleeve 18 having a flange 20 at one end thereof. The flange 20 is heat sealed or otherwise secured to the inner container 12 along a circular welding or adhesive line 22 Figure 1 . An internal groove 24 is formed in the sleeve 18 at the same end as the flange 20 and an external rib 26 encircles the sleeve 18 adjacent the other end thereof. The tap 14 further includes a tap body 28 see particularly Figures 5 and 6 which comprises a cylindrical portion 30 encircled by three raised sealing beads 32 and by a flange 34. The end one of the beads 32 also acts, as will be described later, as a locating ring. The flange 34 is generally circular, as shown in Figure 6, but is stepped to provide a square shoulder 36. To the right of the shoulder 36, as viewed in Figure 5, there is a further cylindrical portion 38 of smaller diameter than the portion 30. The portion 38 is itself extended by a frusto conical section 40 having a conical inner face 42. The face 42 serves as a valve seat. A bore 44, coaxial with the portions 30 and 38, leads to the hollow interior of the section 40 and there is an outlet 46 in the lower part of the section 40. The outlet 46 leads into a spout generally indicated at 48, the spout including a lower, sloping wall 50 and vertical side walls 52. At the lower end of the wall 50 there is a downwardly extending lip 54. Two arms 56 extend forwardly from the section 40 and each arm has, at the free end thereof, an upwardly directed hook 58. Between the arms 56, and extending upwardly from the section 40, there is a column 60. The portion 38 is encircled by a recess 62 and wings 64 Figure 6 extend outwardly on diametrically opposed sides of the flange 34. Each wing is formed with a raised, partspherical protrusion 66. The body cover 68 shown in Figure 7 is generally cylindrical and has, at one end, a transverse wall 70. A solid spigot 72 extends outwardly from the wall 70 and there is a pull tab 74 see also Figure 2 integral with the spigot 72.A slit 76 sub divides the pull tab 74 into an inner part 78, integral with the spigot 72, and an outer part 80 which serves as a pull ring. It will be noted that the outer part 80 is connected to the inner part 78 along the lower periphery of the spigot 72 in the region designated 82. At its open end the body cover 68 is internally encircled by a bead 84 and a protruding stop 86 is provided on the outer face of the body cover. An outlet 88 is provided in the lower part of the body cover 68. Turning now to Figures 8 and 9, the valve operating member 90 illustrated is in the form of a fork having a crossbar 92 and two cranked tines 94,96. Each tine 96 is configured to provide a stop 98. Between the tines 96 there is an element 100 one end of which is in the form of a hook 102 and the other end of which is provided with two conical protrusions 104. The valve closure member 106 of Figures 10 and 11 comprises a stem 108 with a conical valve head 110 at one end thereof. The valve head 110 can be solid but is preferably hollow. The end of the stem 108 remote from the head 110 is forked and a transverse, vertical bore 112 passes through the tines of the fork. The ring 114 shown in Figure 12 is of a resilient material and, as. can be seen from Figures 1 and 16, is intended to be entrained around the column 60 and the hook 102 of the element 100. The safety and locking device 116 of Figures 13, 14 and 15 comprises a short sleeve 118 with wings 120 projecting from opposite sides of the sleeve 118. Each wing 120 is formed with a part spherical depression 122 and a locking tab 124 projects axially from the sleeve 118. A radially extending rib 126 see particularly Figure 15 is provided on the face of each wing 120 opposite to that in which the depression 122 is formed. One edge 128 of each wing 120 is chamfered see particularly Figure 15 . The tap is assembled by pushing the safety and locking device 116 onto the portion 38, the sleeve 118 thereof encircling the portion 38 with the wings 120 projecting horizontally. The protrusions 66 enter the depressions 122 thereby preventing relative rotation between the body 28 and the device 116. Next, from above, the cross bar 92 of the member 90 Figures 8 and 9 is inserted into the two hooks 58 of the body 28. As each of these hooks is more than 1860 in extent, they snap around the cross bar 92 and prevent it from thereafter lifting out of the hooks. The tines lie one on each side of the spout 48. The resilient band 114 Figure 12 is looped about the column 60 and the hook 102 so that, as viewed in Figure 1, an anti blockwise turning action is exerted on the member 90. The body cover 68 shown in Figure 7 is then pushed over the tap body 28 until the bead 84 snaps into the external groove 62 of the portion 38. To enable this to be done the member 90 must be swung in an anti clockwise direction until the lower ends of the tines 94, 96 have moved sufficiently far upwardly not to interfere with motion of the body cover 68. As the body cover 68 is pushed onto the tap body 28, the tines 94,96 come into register with the outlet 88 and eventually project downwardly through this outlet. The stops 98 of the tines 94,96 engage the tab 124 so that, in this condition, the valve operating member 90 cannot be displaced in the direction which opens the tap. Finally, the valve closure element 106 Figures 10 and 11 is pushed through the bore 44 with the stem 108 leading. The element 100 is received between the tines of the forked end of the stem 108 until, eventually, the conical protrusions 104 snap into the two parts of the bore 112. Referring now to Figure 16, this shows part of the blank from which outer container 10 is erected. The reference numeral 130 designates a score line which eventually becomes the lower edge of the front wall 132 see also Figures lr 2, 17 and 18 of the container 10. A T shaped slot 134 is provided, the cross bar of the T being in the base 136 of the outer container 10 and the upright of the T being in the front panel 132. It will be noted that, at the free end of the upright, there is a slightly widened portion 138. Reference numeral 140 designates a line of perforations which enables a panel 142 to be detached from the front wall 132 of the container. The panel 142 is generally rectangular but does have a downward extension 144 and two horizontal extensions 146. The inner container 12 has the connector 16 welded thereto and, through the connector 16, liquid is fed into the container 12. The container 12 is in the form of a bag of synthetic plastics material. This material can be of laminar construction with a metallic foil incorporated as one of the layers. Once the inner container has been filled, the tap 14, assembled as described above, is attached thereto by inserting the portion 30 in the sleeve 18 until the end bead 32 snaps into the groove 24. The sealing beads 32 ensure that liquid does not leak between the connector 16 and the tap body 28. The inner container with the tap attached thereto is placed in the outer container and the position thereof manipulated until the pull tab 74 passes through the cross bar of the slot 134. The entire tap is then pulled upwardly, the spigot 72 sliding in the upright of the slot. Desirably, the size of the slot 134 is such that the material of the outer container 10 is somewhat distorted as the spigot 72 passes along the slot until the spigot enters the enlarged upper portion 138 of the slot. This arrangement inhibits movement of the tap with respect to the outer container. Only the pull tab 74 is now visible from externally of the box, as shown inFigure 2. When liquid is to be dispensed, the upper region of the outer part 80 of the pull tab 74 is gripped and a pull exerted. This has the effect of pulling the outer face of the wall 70 against the inner face of the panel 142 which eventually tears along the perforated line 140. The entire tap is drawn through until the square shoulder 36 seats in the substantially rectangular opening which is created when the panel 142 is detached. It will be noted that the downward extension 144 creates a passage for the tines 96, and the lateral extensions 146 permit passage of the wings 64 and 120. The device 116 is then rotated through 90 degrees with the edges 128 leading. As turning commences, the protrusions 66 leave the depressions 122 and turning continues until the wings 120 are vertical and against the outer face of the wall 132. Overturning causes the tab 124 to engage the stop 86 and this limits further movement. The fit of the device 116 between the wall 132 and the body cover 68 is such that rotation of the device 116 is frictionally restrained. The outer part 80 of the pull tab 74 is then detached entirely and, eventually, the tap and outer container have the appearance illustrated in Figures 17 and 18. The tap of Figures 19 and 20 is based on a type which is commercially availab eand includes a body which is attached to a connector. In the form illustrated, however, there is a forwardly projecting stem 148 of cylindrical form which terminates in a slightly enlarged head 150. The outer container in which an inner container with this tap attached is placed, has, in the front wall thereof, a punched hole.Through this hole the head and part of the stem extend. There is also a panel bounded by a line of perforations. When it is desired to pull the tap from the outer container for use, the head 150 is gripped and pulled. The front wall thus tears along the line of perforations and the tap can be pulled through the resultant opening. It is desirable for the outer container to have in it a narrow slit leading, for example downwardly, from the abovementioned punched hole to a larger hole. The head 150 is readily pushed through the larger hole and the stem is slid along the slit and into the smaller hole. Turning now to Figures 21 etc., the tap and container construction illustrated have some parts in common with the tap and container construction of Figures 1 etc., and, where applicable, like references have been used. Thus, an outer container is shown at 10, an inner container at 12, and a connector at 16. The tap body, which is shown in detail inFigures 23 and 24, has the cylindrical portion 30, three sealing beads 32, flange 34 and wings 64 of the connector of the earlier Figures. The portion 30 is, in this form of tap body, joined to a barrel 152 by means of a flange 154. The barrel 152 is stepped internally to provide an annular stop surface 156 and a conical camming surface 158. Externally the barrel 152 is stepped to provide a shoulder 160 and an encircling bead 162.At the end of the barrel there are two side by side protrusions 164, and there is an aperture 166 in the cylindrical wall of the barrel 152. Internally of the barrel there are two short, axially extending ribs 168. On the outer face of the flange 154 there are four protuberances 170 which are equally spaced in the circumferential direction. Turning now to Figures 25 and 26, a plug 172 is shown in these Figures which comprises a disc like closure 174 and a sleeve 176 which protrudes from the closure 174. It will be noted that the end face of the sleeve 176 remote from the closure 174 is angled thereby to provide a cam follower surface 178. A pin 180 also protrudes from the disc like closure 174 and is located where the sleeve 176 is of minimal length. The safety device 182 Figure 27 has many features in common with the safety device 116 of Figures 13 and 14.However, the tab 124 is omitted and.the bore of the sleeve 118 is slightly flared at one end thereof. The depressions 184 of the device 182 are somewhat smaller than the depressions 122 of the device 116. Turning now to Figures 28 and 29, the rotatable element 186 illustrated is generally cylindrical and includes a pull tab 188. At the end thereof remote from the tab 188, the element 186 is slightly tapered, is longitudinally slit and is formed with an external bead 190. A projecting cam pin 192 has the free end thereof skew to the axis of the pin. The pull tab 188 is sub divided by a slit 194 into an outer part 196 and an inner part 198. Small bridges 200 link the inner and outer parts of the pull tab. The pull tab is sub divided further by a weakened line 202 of rectangular configuration. When the pull tab is broken along the line 202, the inner part 198 comes away, leaving an elongate rectangular indicator portion 204. The portion 204 can have, as indicated, an arrow or other device thereon to indicate the position of the rotatable element 186. To facilitate turning of the rotatable element, a turning ring 206 is provided, the ring 206 being joined by a stepped flange 208 to the cylindrical portion of the element 186. A locking tongue 210 protrudes inwardly from the flange 208 for co operation with the protrusions 164. An aperture 212 forms an outlet from the element 186. The tap described with reference to Figures 21 etc., is assembled as follows. Firstly, the device 182 is pushed over the cylindrical part of the element 186. The flared part of the bore of the device 182 rides over the bead 162 and is retained in place by it. Two of the protuberances 170 enter the depressions 184, thereby inhibiting rotation of the device 182. At this stage, the wings 120 of the device 182 overlie the wings 64 of the tap body. The cylindrical portion of the rotatable element 186 Figure 28 is then pushed into the barrel 152. The camming surface 158 is engaged by the tapered end portion of the cylindrical portion, the tapered portion being cammed in thereby so that the slits therein close. This permits the bead 190 to pass the stop surface 156 whereby subsequent withdrawal of the rotatable element from the barrel 152 is prevented. The tongue 210 passes between the protrusions 164 whereby the rotatable element 186 is inhibited from rotation with respect to the barrel 152. The plug 172 is then pushed into the barrel 152 through the cylindrical portion 30. The pin 180 is received between the ribs 168, and the bead which encircles the sleeve 176 is received within the barrel 152. The plug is thus frictionally retained in position and is prevented from rotating. Finally, the cylindrical portion 30 is pushed into the sleeve 18 as described above. In Figure 30, the front of the outer container 1Q is illustrated. Where applicable, the same reference numerals have been used as in Figure 18. The slot is somewhat differently shaped in that it does not have a wider portion at the upper end thereof. The inner container, with the tap attached thereto, is lowered into the outer container, and the pull tab pushed through the cross bar not shown . The tap is worked upwardly along the slot 134 with the pull tab 188 and the indicator portion 204 outside the container 10. The tap eventually reaches the position shown inFigure 21, and it will be noted that the apertures 166 and 212 are not aligned at this stage so that the tap is in its closed condition. The plug 172 seals off the interior of the inner container 12 from the barrel 152. When it is desired to dispense the contents of the inner container, the upper part of the pull tab is gripped and the entire tap is pulled to the right, as illustrated in Figure 21. The front wall of the container tears along the line 140 so that the panel 142 is detached from the front wall 132. The tap is drawn through the resulting aperture until the flange 34 engages the inner face of the front wall of the container 10. The device 182, which previously extended horizontally, is then turned through 900, the protrusions 170 lifting from the depressions 184 in which they are seated and subsequently re seating themselves in the upper and lower depressions. The tap is now in the condition shown in Figure 1, with the outer container gripped between the flange 34 and the wings 120 of the device 182. The rotatable element 186 is then turned, sufficient force being exerted to cause the tongue 210 to deflect one or other of the protrusions 164 so that the rotatable element can thereafter turn freely. Initial turning of the rotatable element causes the cam pin 192 to move along the cam follower surface 178 of the plug 172. As the plug is restrained against rotary movement by its pin 180, it moves axially and is thus urged out of the barrel 152. Generally, the plug will then simply float upwardly in the liquid. To dispense the desired quantity of liquid, the rotatable element is turned by gripping the ring 206 so that the apertures 166 and 212 come into register. If desired the tap of Figures 1 etc can be provided with a plug serving the same purpose as that shown in Figures 25 and 26. This plug can be pressed into the cylindrical portion 38. Either the plug can have a projecting rod extending towards the member 106 or the member 106 can have such a rod extending towards the plug. When the member 90 is first rotated clockwise to dispense liquid, whether by hand. or by means of a glass pressed against the tines 94 and 96, the plug is urged from the cylindrical portion 38 as the member 106 lifts from its seat,
