# Germ killing composition.

## Abstract
A germ killing composition, such as a soap, toothpaste or ointment includes a first material, in the form of a solution or gel, containing sodium chlorite, and a second material, also in the form of a solution or gel, containing lactic acid, the latter being present in sufficient amount to lower the pH of the aqueous media to less than about seven. Various forms of dispenser may be employed to accommodate the two materials separated from one another and to dispense them simultaneously, such as a syringe comprising housing 20 divided by partition 22 and having coupled pistons 26, 28 for ejecting the materials simultaneously.

## Description
GERM KILLING COMPOSITIONSPECIFICATION This invention relates to germ killing compositions or materials, and more particularly to materials adapted for use in cleaning, sanitizing, deodorizing, and disinfecting surfaces into or onto which the material is to be applied. Chlorine dioxide C102 has been tried in the past for skin disinfection with limited success.One such chlorine dioxide preparation was called Cryoclave, produced by International Dioxide. Chlorine dioxide has, however, had more success as an additive to medicine to inhibit microbial growth in the medicine itself, as disclosed in CanadianPatent Specification Jo. 955 848, than for its antimicrobial activity on the body. A common method for using or incorporating chlorine dioxide gas into products has been to dissolve the gas in a liquid to form a solution. This method has a number of drawbacks. The chlorine dioxide gas tends to escape from the solution so that its shelf lMte is relatively short compared with other skin medications. When the product is applied to the skin or a lesion as a liquid, lack of adhesion of the product to the skin or lesion results in a short contact time. Since fungal diseases and other types of infected lesions usually require many hours or even days of contact for effective treatment thereof, a strict regimen of reapplication would be necessary to ensure adequate therapeutic response. These objections to the use of chlorine dioxide on the skin can be overcome or substantially alleviated if the gas is incorporated in a gel base.The high viscosity of these gels and their bioadhesion to the skin prevents escape of the gas and also holds the gas in contact with the skin for long periods, particularly in conjunction with the use of a conventional occlusive barrier, such as a plastic film bandage, for the afflicted area. The process of acidifying sodium chlorite to produce chlorine dioxide within the gel is novel.The gelling material must not only be compatible with the strong oxidizing action of chlorine dioxide, so that there is no complexing with this reactive substance, but must also be compatible with the alkaline sodium chlorite and the acid. Many substances are not compatible with chlorine dioxide. Most flavours and colouring agents, for example, will react with chlorine dioxide. CanadianPatent Specification No. 955 848 discloses adding these kinds of substances, but this addition reduces the germicidal effectiveness of the chlorine dioxide and thus shortens thu shelf life of the product. A further example of incompatibility is hydrogen peroxide, which has been successfully gelled with a glycerin base. Glycerin, however, will react with chlorine dioxide and therefore cannot be used as a thickener for a base with chlorine dioxide producing components. The gelling agent must, of course, be non toxic, non irritating, and easily removed from the skin. Thus, the primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved germ killing composition which may be incorporated in or constitute cleaning, deodorizing, sanitizing, and disinfecting materials including gels, soap products, toothpaste, and the like, wherein these disadvantages are obviated. With this object in view, the present invention provides a germ killing composition comprising two solutions or gels adapted to be simultaneously applied and mixed in situ, and one of which contains sodium chlorite, characterised in that a first one of said solutions or gels is an aqueous eolu tion or gel comprising sodium ohlorite, and that the second of said solutions or gels is an aqueous solution or gel comprising lactic acid, there being sufficient of said lactic acid to lower the pH of the compssttion to less than about 7. A product according to the invention may be packaged to comprise one material containing the sodium chlorite separate from another material containing the lactic acid in sufficient amount to lower the pH of the final product, formed upon mixing of the materials together, to less than about 7.

Such tubes are commercially available. The following description refers to the accom panying drawings wherein like reference numerals designate similar parts throughout the various views. Each figure illustrates a respective dispenser or like device for dispensing the two parts or components of a germ killing preparation of the invention, comprising respectively the sodium chlorite and the lactic acid as above discussed. In rig. 1 there is shown a dual syringe espeoially adapted for use in dispensing a germ killing composition in accordance with the invention, in the form of solutions or gels and comprises a syringe housing 20 provided with a partition or separator 22. A single actuator 24 controls dual plungers 26 and 28 which serve to expel the separate contents from the housing 20 simultaneously. and in equal amounts as indicated at 30 as a material or composition ready to be spread evenly on a surface to be treated. In Fig. 2 there is shown a syringe comprising a housing 40 having a single plunger 44 which, when actuated, causes material 46 to break through a frangible barrier 48 and mix with the material 50 so that the combination of ingredients forming the germ killing composition is expelled as composite gel 52 which is ready for use. Fig. 3 shows an arrangement comprising two reservoirs 60 and 62 interoonneoted by tubing 64 with separate control valves 66 and 68 and provided with a shut ofi valve 70 for controlling fluid flow in the direction oi arrow 72. there In Fig. 4 is shown a equeezable vial 80 containing frangible containers 82 and 84 which will break, upon application of pressure to the vial 80, to permit the ingredients, contained in each container 82, 84, to admix and to be delivered as a germ killing composition through a cotton doubter 86 in a convenient manner. Fig. 5 shows z dual applicator including two containers 90 and 92 filled respectively with the two different materials and each having a sponge applicator head 94 and 96 for simultaneously applying the two materials to form the germ killing composition. The two containers 90 and 92 are bonded or otherwise join ed together. In Fig. 6 there is shown a trigger actuated dispenser in which a container 100 is provided with z divider 102 for maintaining solutions 104 and 106 separate. When trigger 108 of conventional pump actuator 110 is depressed, the materials are sucked through the respective tubes 112 and 114 and are sprayed simultaneously to form the germ killing composition on a receiving surface, not shown0 Fig. 7 shows a dual dispenser, similar to a foam shaving cream dispenser marketed by the GilletteCompany, in which an outer container 130 encloses a first material and an inner container 132 which contains a second material which is thereby separated from the first material.Both such materials are under gas pressure and when actuator 134 is depressed, both materials are simultaneously dispensed as a germ killing composition as a result of the gaseous pressure. Referring now to Figs. 8 and 9, a plastic container 200 is firstly partially filled with one solution after which a removable separator 202 is applied around the container 200 to confine this one solution to one end of the container. Thereafter, the other unfilled section of the container is filled through its neck 204 and cap 206 secured in place. When it is desired to use the contents, the separator is removed and, as shown in Fig. 9, the entire oontents are mixed to form the germ killing composition which ia then ready for application. Sn Fig. 10 there is shown a tube or container 220 including a separator 22 whereby the two components forming the germ killing composition of the invention are kept apart. Provided on the bottom of the tube on or container 220 is a tab 224 which a wind up key 226 can be used to expel the contents of the container 220 simultaneously in equal proportions. Referring now to Fig. 11, this shows a container 240 having a divider 242 therein. The container 240 is thereby adapted to contain two different gels 244 and 246 and flow of the gel 244 through its passage through neck 260 of the container 240 without corre ponding flow of the gel 246 through its passage has the effect of actuating a pivotal valve member 250 to prevent passage of the gel 244 and vice versa. For example, if gel 244 flows and gel 246 does not, vanes 254 moves into valve closed engagement with valve seat 256 while valve head 258 contacts the neck 260 to prevent flow of the gel 244.Even flow of both gels allows the vanes to stay in the illustrated position and permit equal delivery. Fig. 12 shows another form of container 280 incorporating a separator2282 as well as a guide 286 at neck 288 of the container 280 and is so arranged that the guide 286 will lock upon movement or flow of one only of the gels within the container so as to cause an appropriate one of the valve vanes 290 and 292 to prevent further flow until the delivery of both gels is equalized. In Pig. 13 there is shown another modified form of dispenser comprising container 300 haTing a divider 302 therein for separating compartments 304 and 306, containing different gels, from each other.Pivoted to the divider 302 is a valve assembly 310 which includes means for preventing unequal flow of the separate gels. As has already been mentioned, each of the illustrated dispensers is intended to be loaded separately with the respective sodium chlorite containing and lactic acid containing components of the germ killing preparations of the invention for these components to be stmultaneously dispensed and mixed to form the inventive composition, e.g. in situ or preparatory to use. The principles, preferred aspects and examples, of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms or examples disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in this art without departing from the scope oi the invention, as defined by the following claims.
