# VECTOR FOR EXPRESSION OF POLYPEPTIDES

## Abstract
A replicable plasmidic expression vector, capable of high levels of expression and secretion of polypeptides in a bacillus is disclosed. The vector contains a DNA sequence comprising the promoter and regulatory regions which control expression and secretion of proteases in a bacillus operably liked to a DNA sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The expression vector is particu larly useful in the production of B. amyloliquefaciens proteases in B. subtilis. The method facilitates the isolation of proteases from various bacilli.
