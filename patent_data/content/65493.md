## Description
Description of the invention entitled DEVICE TO SORT COSdPOST This invention concerns a device to sort compost. To be more exact, the invention concerns a device to sort compost..whereby said device can remove glass and hard bodies such as stony material, for instance, and any residues of light plas .tic materials from the compost itself. It is known that in plants which treat wastes and which form the compost from the organic fraction, the compost is ..obtained as the main product except for any materials which.may be sorted for re circulation in a productive activity. Itis knom that the presence of glass, even in small particles, in compost lessens the commercial value of the com . post itself very greatly. It follows that it becomes necessary to remove the glass.and any other hard bodies from the compost for the purpose .of getting a product with a higher commercial value. This invention entails outstanding advantages in that the device can be readily introduced dovvnstream from systems for the overhead transport and storage of the compost and carries out removal of glass and light plastics and at the same time .produces a cleaned compost with a simple and reliable method and a very lov. con uliption ol cncr . Thus, the invention enables the glass, hard bodies and li tht plastics to be removed from the compost so as to refine the latter.. This removal is obtained by making use of the combined ac tion of aerodynamic and gravitational forces. According to the invention a rotating druid is envisaged .vThick can improve the sorted collection of the materials thus removed. According to the invention a main chamber is fed through a vibrating hopper and is positioned substantially upright.. The compost together with any suitable materials falls .from the vibrating hopper and is struck by a stream of air which conditions its trajectory. The lightest portion, which usually consists of light pla sties, is thrust far away, whereas the normal portion consist .ing of the compost follows a slightly modified trajectory. The hardest and heaviest portion, instead, keeps to a sub stantially straight trajectory and the sorting of said portion of the compost may be further enhanced by a possible rot .ating drum. Suitable hoppers located at the bottom and a possible se .parator working with a flow of air serve to gather the glass and hard bodies, the cleaned compost and the light plastics respectively. The air discharged can be dispersed into the surrounding .environment or be recovered with an appropriate duct and re .cycled through the fan itself. The invention is embodied, therefore, with a device to sort compost, whereby the device is able to remove glass and hard bodies such as stony materials, for instance, and any residues of light plastic materials from the compost and is characterized by including in cooperation v ith a main cham ber stretching substantially in an upright direction and fed by a vibrating hopper a wall through which a stream of air passes and spreads in to said main chamber, and two hoppers located substantially underneath the zone.. of discharge of the vibrating hopper and possibly cooper ating with a rotating sorting drum, r whereby a separator which works with a flow of air and can . gather the light substances may possibly be located at the side side, r and whereby the air discharged may perhaps be re cycled ad . vantageously through the fan group. With the help of the attached table let us now see the device of the invention shown with a diagram in said table. The device of the invention consists of a main chamber IO fed from above by a conveyor belt II which discharges the compost to be sorted above a vibrating hopper I2. Said vibrating hopper I2 in its turn discharges the material into the main chamber and lets it fall from above. While said material 21 is falling, it is struck by a stream of air 20. Said stream of air 20 is generated by fan means I5 and is conveyed by conveyor baffle means I4 cooperating with wall means I3 of a substantially porous kind. The stream of air 20 strikes the material 21 falling from .the vibrating hopper I2 and modifies the trajectory of said fall. The lightest material is displaced by the stream of air so much that it follows a trajectory I2I which takes it so as to drop into the separator 19 working with a flow of air.Said light material consists substantially of light plastics. The cleaned compost tends to keep to an intermediate tra jectory 22I and to drop into the hopper I7, whence it is with drawn along B. The hrd .lateral such as glass, hard bodies and stony r. . terial tends to follow a substantially straiCit trajectory and to knock against the possible rotating drum I8, which throws it against the wall of the hopper I6. The rotating drum 18 can be equipped with scraper brushes so as to enhance its performance. The air flows out from the outlet ducts 22 I22 and can be discharged, or else can be re cycled through 222 so as to be re aspirated wholly or partly by the fan means I5. Thus the glass and other hard bodies having a vo lumetric mass much greater than that of the compost are withdrawn from the hopper I6 along h. The cleaned compost, which has followed an intermediate trajectory, is withdravm from the hopper I7 along B. The light plastics are recovered along C from the separator I9 working with a flow of air. As we said earlier, the differentiated gathering of the two kinds of materials coming to the hoppers I6 I7 is further improved by increasing the sorting efficiency with the provision of a rotating drum I8 which perhaps may be equip ped with scraper brushes. We have described here a preferential embodiment of the invention, but variants are possible. Thugs the shapes, sizes and characteristics of the main chamber can be modified and it can be envisaged that the porous wall is replaced with other walls that can be employed for the purpose. The vibrating hopper can be replaced with other distributing systems and the fan means can be replaced with other means that throw out air also the hoppers can be equipped with automatic disehargers, and so on. These and other variants are all possible for a technici an in thi field without departing thereby fror the scope of the idea of the solution.
