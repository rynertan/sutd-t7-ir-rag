# PERFECTED REFRIGERATOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a perfected refrigerator with two compartments, one for frozen food and one for cold food, capable of withstanding working loads of considerable intensity in the freezer compartment without however, harming the foods or drinks in the cold food compartment. This result is achieved by inserting into the cold food compartment one or more elements which are capable of storing heat or cold in predetermined period of operation and of yielding them up in other periods of operation. In particular it deals with the provision of a heat storage element in the cold food compartment of the refrigerator which may be constituted for example by a tank of pure water or of a solution with a freezing point slightly above 0 C, which is placed in the coldest zone in this compartment just below the evaporator . This, during normal operation, the water in the tank remains in the liquid state while under conditions of operation with the compressor continuously activated, as occurs during rapid freez ing, if the temperature within the cold food compartment tends to fall below zero such as would harm some foods contained therein the mass of water contained in the said tank introduces an obstacle to this lowering of the temperature. Indeed before the temperature in the compartment can fall below zero, the refrigerator must take all the latent heat of freezing from the water in the tank which is necessary to transform it into ice and hence
