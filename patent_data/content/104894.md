# Tool components.

## Abstract
A tool component comprising a composite compact 12 located in a sloping recess in one end of a solid, elongate right circular cylindrical pin 10 and bonded thereto. The recess is characterised in that it is formed in the pin to one side of a longitudinal plane 26 passing through the central axis of the pin and the base wall 22 of the recess slopes from one end surface 28 towards a side surface 30 . Bonding of the composite compact to the pin is preferably achieved by means of a braze alloy having a working temperature of less than 700 DEG C and containing silver, copper, zinc, manganese and nickel. The tool component has particular application as a cutting component for a drill bit.
