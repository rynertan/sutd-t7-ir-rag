# Current driven flyback power supply.

## Abstract
A current driven flyback power supply 10 has a tran sistor current switch 24 which periodically couples a primary current through the primary winding 26 of a power transformer 22 which is connected between a source of DC and the collector of the current switch 24 . A current trans former 32 has a first winding 38 coupled between the primary winding 26 and the collector of the current switch 24 , and a second winding 40 which develops a drive cur rent proportional to the primary current. The drive current is coupled to the base of the current switch 24 and increases proportionally with the increasing amplitude of the primary current. An electrical switch 44 shorts the drive current to ground to turn off the current switch 24 so that stored en ergy in the power transformer 22 is coupled out through its secondary winding 28 to an output rectifier circuit 48 which develops the output DC voltage. After the stored en ergy has been completely coupled out through the second ary winding 28 a first current pulse is developed to turn on the current switch 24 to initiate the primary current. During high output power loading conditions, a second current pulse is developed at a selected point in time after the cur rent switch 24 turns off and prior to the stored energy be ing completely coupled out through the secondary winding 28 . The second current pulse turns on the current switch 24 whereby the initial primary current is boosted in ampli tude by the residual stored energy in the power transformer 22 .
