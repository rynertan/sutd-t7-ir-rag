## Description
The present invention relates to the improvement of a control system for traction of rolling stock which serves to effectually utilize the adhesive force frictional force between wheels of the rolling stock and rails as the tractive or braking force US A 3 508 795 . It is well known that, since vehicles on rails obtain their tractive or braking force from the friction between wheels thereof and the rails, slipping or skidding of the wheels will occur if the driving or braking torque goes beyond a limited value defined by a coefficient of friction between the wheels and rails. The slip occuring in the power running is substantially the same phenomenon as the skid occuring at the time of braking. Thus, as a way of preventing both, a single means should serve. Accordingly, hereinafter, a description is developed, taking an example of the operation in the power running of an electric vehicle and the especially different respect in the braking period therefrom is described at the time when the description is needed. In a conventional electric vehicle, a re adhesion control or traction recovery control is based on the way that slip is detected by the difference in velocity between a driving wheel and a trailing wheel or among a plurality of deriving electric motors hereinafter, simply referred to as a driving motor . Detection of such slip also includes the way of utilizing the electric signal resultantly indicating the above mentioned velocity difference, such as voltage, current or the like. When the velocity difference, the voltage difference or the like goes beyond a predetermined value, the driving torque is diminished. However, these control methods result in that a maximal adhesive force cannot be effectively utilized for the tractive force because of the following reason. In these control methods, a certain threshold for the velocity difference mentioned above is set in order to judge whether or not the slip occurs, since there is a slight difference in the velocity between the driving wheel and the trailing wheel even during the normal running in which the driving wheel adheres on the rail and produces the tractive force. The theshold for the velocity difference, therefore, is selected at a relatively high value to such extent that the slip is not detected by the velocity difference during the normal running, and is usually fixed to such value. Further, there is the following relationship between the traction force and the velocity difference mentioned above. Namely, as the traction force increases, the velocity difference also increases, until the traction force reaches its maximal value which is limited by a well known adhesive force determined by a friction coefficient between the driving wheel and the rail and an axle weight of the driving wheel. When the traction force exceeds the maximal value, it decreases as the velocity difference increases. The maximal traction force limited by the adhesive force varies in accordance with the friction coefficient of the rail, i.e. the state of surface of the rail. Accordingly, the velocity difference corresponding to the maximal traction force also varies. Although it is desired to drive the vehicle with the maximal traction force, that is, with the velocity difference at which the maximal traction force is effected, this is very difficult, since the threshold is fixedly determined as stated above in spite of variation of the velocity difference at which the traction force becomes maximum. Consequently, the maximal adhesive force can not be effectively utilized for the traction force. Furthermore, there is the method in which the vibration inherent in the system composed of the wheels and the wheel shaft, which is generated during occurence of the slip, is detected and the driving wheel driving torque is controlled so as to hold the vibration below a predetermined value ASEA Journal Vo.48, No.6, 1975, pp.147 149 . However, in this method, there exists the disadvantage that the generation of the inherent vibration depends upon the state of the driving wheel and the surface of the rail as is understood from, for example, the fact that it is not likely to be generated when the wheel and the rail are wet, and the signal required for the control is not often obtained. Moreover, since the generation of the inherent vibration also depends upon the structure of a driving device for the electric vehicle or the system of a main circuit, the generating conditions vary, and it is difficult to predict these generating conditions. Accordingly, it is difficult to design the control device. Besides, when generating the inherent vibration, since the inherent vibration is generally generated only when the velocity difference goes beyond the point of the maximal traction force and it goes beyond a certain degree, the method described above can be referred to as traction recovery control which has the function of detecting the already caused slip and then accomplishing the re adhesion of the slipping wheel, so that it is also difficult to utilize the maximal adhesive force in this method. Moreover, as another example, an electric vehicle having the following function is known. The function is that of detecting a vehicle velocity v and an armature current I It is an object of the present invention to provide an traction control system for a rolling stock which serves to employ the adhesive force by the friction between rails and wheels more effectively for the power running as well as braking of vehicles. A feature of the present invention is in that the adhesive force resulted from the friction between the rails and the wheels is effectively utilized by detecting a relative velocity between a peripheral velocity of the wheel and a vehicle velocity or a relative velocity related value and a traction or braking force produced by the wheel at that time or a traction or braking force related value, obtaining changing rates of relative velocity and the traction or braking force which are respectively the variations with respect to unit time and controlling a driving or braking torque applied to the wheel in response thereto. Namely, the present invention utilizes the fact, for example, that a changing rate df dv Preceding to the explanation of embodiments of the present invention, the basic matters underlying the present invention will be at first described with reference to Figs.1a to 1c. Fig.1a is a diagram for explaining the relation of active and reactive forces between a wheel and a rail. In this figure, reference numerals 2 and 4 denote a wheel and a surface of a rail on which the wheel runs, respectively. A reference character T By the way, when a certain traction force f occurs, there appears a slight difference in the velocity between the peripheral velocity v As is understood from this figure, although the state that the traction force f increases with increase of the relative velocity v As is stated before, the maximal traction force f In any case, however, the whole operating zone can be divided into the zone A where, with increase of the relative velocity v Here, the traction force f can be obtained by the following equation wherein ϑ is the moment of inertia of a whole driving system converted into a driving axle and v Referring now to Fig.2, the description will be made of a control system for maintaining traction in a rolling stock according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig.2 shows an example in which the control device according to the present invention is applied for a so called chopper control electric locomotive. In this figure, a reference numeral 6 denotes a pantagraph, 8 a reactor, and 10 a capacitor which forms a filter together with the reactor 8. A reference numeral 12 denotes an armature of an electric driving motor 14, and 16 denotes a series wound field winding of the motor 14. A reference numeral 18 denotes a free wheel diode and 20 denotes a chopper composed of a semiconductor switch such as a thyristor. A duty ratio of an on off operation of the chopper 20 is controlled by the output of an automatic current regulator 22 abbreviated as ACR, hereinafter so as to control the voltage applied to the motor 14. The peripheral velocity v Such delay element 32 can be realized, for example, by a circuit as shown in Fig.3. In this figure, R₁ is a resistor for providing a time constant at the time of increasing of the input resistance value is R₁ . D denotes a diode for inhibiting the discharge toward the input side. R₂ denotes a discharge resistor resistance value is R₂ of a capacitor C capacitance is C . In order to simplify the description, there is set the condition that the output impedance of the signal source is zero, the load impedance is infinity and the diode is an ideal diode. In this case, with regard to the input and output characteristic, the time constant τ1 of the output voltage increase given when the input voltage is increased is R₁C and the time constant τ2 of the output voltage decrease given when the input voltage is decreased is R₂C. Thus, Referring back to Fig.2, an output I The current instruction I Next the control device 26 is described, referring to Fig.4. The control device 26 is composed of a computer system and an input output device abbreviated as I O device, hereinafter . The computer system has, as usual, a processor unit, a read only memory RAM which stores programs and various kinds of constants necessary for operation in the processor, a random access memory RAM which temporarily stores input data for calculation and output data as an operation result of the processor and buses connecting thereamong. The I O device is formed mainly by converters, a part of which converts analog signals into digital signals which can be processed within the processor these converters are called A D converter and the remaining converts digital signals as an operation result into analog signals for control these converters are called D A converter . Fig.4, however, does not illustrate the control device 26 in the form of such a concrete structure of hardware, but shows it as a functional block diagram, in which the control device 26 is divided into an arithmetic logic operation unit and an I O unit. The I O unit 40 serves to receive the vehicle velocity v through a line 42, the peripheral velocity v Fig.5 is a flow chart showing one example of the logical operation of the operation unit 72. At first, there is accomplished at a step 100 the discrimination as to whether or not v If v When the relation f v As stated above, only in the zone B shown in Fig.1b, the control output I However, when the value of the maximal traction force f Moreover, in the zone B shown in Fig.1b, when the relative velocity v Further, in the embodiment shown in Fig.5, when f v Herein, G₁, G₂, G₃, G₄, G₅ are respectively positive constants indicative of a gain. However, in order to realize the above 1 , 2 and 6 cases, the arrangement of Fig.2 or Fig.4 is required to be somewhat modified as is understood from, for example, the fact that the control device 26 is required to take in the output of the current instruction generator 36 in a case of employing the current instruction I Further, when running, the vehicle produces the undesired vibration, which causes an erroneous operation of the control device 26. In order to prevent this, a suitable margin value δ positive constant can be provided for the discrimination operation in the step 106 of the flow chart shown in Fig.5. Namely, if the relation f v In the description of the embodiment stated above, there was provided the condition that the state of the rail surface varys only slightly, so that the relation between the relative velocity v Fig .6 shows state modes in the relation between the relative velocity v The mode A₁ stays in the zone A shown in Fig.1b where the traction force f is increased up to f From the formula 2 , it can be understood that the peripheral driving force In view of the above stated studies, it will be understood that only the case of the mode B₁, that is, f 0 and v Fig.7 shows another example of the logical operation of the operation unit 72 Fig.4 in a case of accomplishing the improved control as above stated. As is understood from this figure, only when the relations f 0 and v Fig.8 shows one example of changes in the reference I Referring to Fig.8, it is assumed that the limit value of the traction force f As is shown in Fig.8 and described above, in case the limit value f Further, the delay element 32 of the present embodiment is provided for the main purpose of gradually increasing the driving torque T The embodiments described heretofore has the function of making the control device 26 generate the control output I Fig.9 shows the overall block diagram of the another embodiment stated above. In this figure, like parts are identified by the same reference numerals as those in Fig.2. The description will be made, focusing the part different from Fig.2. The control device 26 serves to accomplish the operation for obtaining a control output I The controll device 26 is almost similar to that shown in Fig.4. This differs from that of Fig.4 in that the current limit instruction I Fig.10 is a flow chart of the logical operation of the operation unit 72 Fig .4 of the control device 26 in a case of the present embodiment. As shown in this figure, in the present embodiment the mode of the running is discriminated to be either one of A₁, A₂, B₁ and B₂ on the basis of the polarities of the difference v Returning to the step 308, if the difference f is judged to be negative, the operation goes to a step 316. In this case, the driving wheel runs in the running state of the mode B, and the relative velocity v Fig.11 shows the changes of the respective current instructions I As described above, the control device of the present embodiment has the advantage that the frequency of slip is further reduced since the traction force always converges on its maximal value f Furthermore, in the embodiment shown in Fig.9, the signal in proportion to the changing rate f v The following signals can be considered in relation to the mode B₂ The following signals are considered in relation to the state modes A₁ and A₂ In the embodiments as described hitherto, a main circuit of the electric vehicle having one driving motor 14 has been shown. Next, the explanation is done of the case where the present invention is applied to the electric vehicle which has a plurality of the driving motors. Fig.12 shows an example of a main circuit of the electric vehicle where one chopper serves to control three driving motors connected in parallel. For example, in a case of an electric locomotive with 6 driving shafts, there are many cases of employing the system of dividing the driving motors into two groups, three by three, providing one chopper in each group and independently controlling each group. Fig.12 shows the embodiment for the electric locomotive stated above and one of two driving motor groups. In this figure, reference characters 12a, 12b and 12c denote armatures of respective driving motors 14a, 14b and 14c, and 16a, 16b and 16c denote field windings thereof. As shown in the figure, three driving motors 14a, 14b and 14c are connected in parallel, and armature currents thereof are controlled by one chopper device 20. Reference characters 18a, 18b and 18c indicate free wheel diodes in relation to the respective driving motors 14a, 14b and 14c. Reference characters 24a, 24b and 24c denote tachogenerators mounted on axles driven by the motors 14a, 14b and 14c respectively, and outputs thereof correspond to the peripheral velocity v There is further provided in this embodiment a maximal value detecting circuit 92, which receives the detected armature currents I As described above, the present embodiment is designed to seek the relative velocity v In the embodiments described heretofore, the control device 26 executes the operation so as to obtain the traction force f produced at that time and to provide the control output I Moreover, let us review a situation when the rail surface is changed from wet to dry. In this case, the relative velocity v As is described above, since in every modes of the running state both the differences Δf and ΔT In the above stated embodiments, the armature current is fed back to the subtracter 38, 28 so as to automatically control the armature current I Further, the foregoing description was developed as taking an example of the slip phenomenon when power running, but it is evident that this invention can be applied to the skid phenomenon when braking. In the latter case, in consideration of v v Although we have herein shown and described some forms of apparatus and control methods embodying the present invention, it should be understood that various changes and modifications other than those as mentioned above may be made therein within the scope of the appended claims.
