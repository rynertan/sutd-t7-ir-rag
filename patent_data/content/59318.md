## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a bar code reader to speech system and more particularly to a system wherein the bar code is of a novel format and located proximate associated text. In today s code reader systems, coded data is stored by printing a series of black vertical bars of varying widths on a white background. An optical sensor can sense the difference between the presence or absence of a bar, and can determine the width of the bar when one is sensed.Problems exist in the current systems, though, in that they rely on a transition from black to white to recognize data. This requires the surface containing the data to be clean and dirt free, and have no extraneous marks or spots of any type. Invalid data can result if these conditions are allowed to exist. In addition, the printing process must be of high quality in order to insure constant results when data is read. Uniformity of darkness of bar codes is very important so that noise and false data impulses may be avoided. In the prior art, such coding has been associated with printed text by locating the visible bar code adjacent the associated text. The user scans the visible code with a sensor to obtain a manifestation of the code, representing the associated text.Upon the reading of the bar code by the sensor, the signals generated thereby may be converted into synthesized speech. This visible bar code, however, is distracting to the user, and the pattern thereof requires much space relative to the printed text. It is an object of the present invention to provide a means for storage of coded data correlated with text material. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a storage means for coded data not subject to the problems of extraneous marks and dirt causing invalid data to be generated. A further object of the invention is to provide data storage not requiring pronounced transistions of light reflection magnitude for data.retrieval. Another object of this invention is to provide speech from bar code associated with printed text. Another object of this invention is to provide speech from transparent bar code printed over text. Still another object of this invention is to provide bar code associated with text, the bar code being configured to permit sampling in the center of each data bar space. A further object of this invention is to provide a bar code reader whose output is synthesizing speech by anLPC speech synthesizer. These and other objects will be made evident in the detailed desctiption that follows.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One purpose of the disclosed invention is to provide a means for printed data storage that does not interfere with associated printed text. In a preferred embodiment, the coded data is printed with transparent ink, allowing the data to be located with preference to system considerations. The coded data is adapted to be sensed by a hand held wand, and ultimately, to activate a speech synthesis circuit. The data read by the user is correlated with a spoken word, and the picture or symbol learning process is greatly aided, without confusion which might be encountered if coded data such as bar code were visible. Preferably, the data representing printed text is located in close proximity to that text to avoid confusion, althouigh this is not a requirement.The printed text referred to herein is intended to mean not only printed words, but pictorial and symbolic representations as well. A visual representation of the coded data is also contemplated. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a representation of recorded data which is machine readable and associated with user recognizable text. In this aspect of the invention, a user is able to pass a sensor over the coded data and while viewing the associated text, hear the text being spoken or described by a speech synthesis mechanism. In another aspect of the invention, the user passes a sensor directly over the text material, which has coded data transparently printed directly on it, and a speech synthesizer responds as if the text were read without benefit of machine code, the transparent ink not being visible to the naked eye. A third aspect of the invention involves the use of transparent ink with an IR absorbent dye. An emitter sensor mechanism is passed over the transparent code, and where a code bar is not present, the IR energy is reflected and detected by an IR sensor. Where a code bar is present, the IR energy is absorbed by the dye present in the ink, and no reflection is detected. As provided for in the invention, coded data in a bar code format is printed to correlate with the text which it represents. The code may be located where it would be most convenient to correlate with printed text. In the case where transparent ink is used, a bar code may be printed directly over the text which it represents. In the instance of a transparent ink containing an IR absorbent dye, an IR sensor emitter device may be employed, eliminating the need for illumination of the code with visible light. This preferred embodiment is a transparent ink bar code that is responsive to infrared as printed over associated text. An optical reader, known as a wand, is passed over the text and the invisible coded bars to read Cata from the bar. A speech producing system has a nicrocontroller which is also employed to control the reading of the bar code. The bar code is arranged in a navel format having a synchronization bar followed by a bar less space that is one half the space width of the synchronization bar, followed by full width data bar spaces and finally by a barless full space. This format provides for measuring the time required for the wand to traverse the synchronization bar by counting up a counter. The counter is then counted down traversing the one half bar less space to the approximate center of the first data bar space, providing for sampling the data bar space at or about its center. The counter is reset and counted down again to the next data bar space and so on. The dead time space following the data bars spaces is used for initializing the system to read the next set of data bars. Allophonic code is read from the data bars, digitized and sent to the speech producing system. The speech producing system decodes the allophonic code and synthesizes it through an LPC synthesizer providing speech that corresponds to the allophonic code read from the bar code.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a block diagram of the inventive bar code reader to speech synthesizer system. Figure 2 is the bar code format. Figures 3a 3c are a description of the allophone library. Figure 4 illustrates the synthesizer frame bit content. Figure 5 illustrates the allophone library bit content. Figures 6a and 6b form a flow chart describing the control of the speech producing system of the invention. Figures 7a 7i form a flow chart describing the intonation pattern structuring of the speech producing system. Figures 8a 8e form a flow chart detailing the control of a microprocessor of the speech producing system over the bar code reader. Figure 9 is an example of bar code printed directly over the represented text. In a working example, the bars shown on the letters are not visible inasmuch as they are printed with transparent ink. Figures 10 and 11 show the operation of an infrared IR emitter sensor system used in conjunction with ink containing IR absorbent dyes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Figure 1 illustrates the speech producing system which is made up of 420 microprocessor 11 having an input to 356 stringer 13 which has an optional allophone library memory 12 and which also has an output to 268 synthesizer 14 whose output is loud speaker 15. This speech producing system is fully described and claimed in pending U.S. Patent Application U.S. Serial No.240,693 filed March 5, 1981, entitled Speech ProducingSystem and assigned to the assignee of this invention. Digitizer 16 provides an input to 420 microprocessor 11 and has as its input, the output from wand 17. The combination of wand 17 and digitizer 16 is well known in the prior art. A SKAN A MATIC CORP type T22043 sigrial linearizer and wave converter, for example, may be used. Document 18 carries text with transparent bar code overlaying the text. to be read by the wand 17. Figure 2 illustrates the format of the bar code of this preferred embodiment. A sync bit is followed by an adjustment space which is one half the width of the sync bit. Following the adjustment space are four data bits which are full width, that is, the same width as the sync bit. Finally a dead time space follows the data bars and is used for initializatidn As As indicated above, the sync bar provi.des a count as the wand 17 is passed over it.The adjustment space, which is one half the width of the sync bar, provides for one half of a subsequent countdown of the counter that counted the sync bar time. That then enables a reading of data bar 1 when the counter reaches 0, thus placing the sampling of data bar 1 at or near the center. The counter is reset and again cqunted down so that data bar 2 is read at the center and so on. The bar code may be opaque or transparent. In this preferred embodiment, the transparent bar comprises an infrared absorbent ink in an organic varnish. The infrared absorbent ink is commercially available from, for example, Exciton Chemical Company, identified as IR 132. It is further identified as 2 ,2 ,2 dithenylamino 3 ,3 ,4 methoxy, 4 oxobutyl naphto d thiozole 2 , 3H ethylidene, 1 , cyclopenten l Yl ethenyl 3 4 methoxy 4 oxobutyl, naphtyl 2 , 3 , d ghiazolium and empirically as C53 H48 N3 O4 S2 C104 It should be noted that printed text means words, pictures, graphic representation and the like. The 420 microprocessor 11 is a Texas InstrumentsIncorporated Type TMCO420 microcomputer described in detail in Appendix A which includes 26 sheets of specification and 9 sheets of drawings, enclosed herewith and incorporated by reference. The 356 stringer cont roller 13 is a Texas InstrumentsTMCO356, which is described in detail in Appendix B which comprises 21 specification sheets, and 11 sheets of drawings, enclosed herewith and incorporated by. reference. Allophone library 12 is a Texas Instruments Type TMS6100 TMC350 voice synthesis memory which is ROM internally organized as 16Kx8 bits. Synthesizer 14 is fully described in previously mentioned United States Patent No. 4,209,836. However, in addition, 286 synthesizer 14 has the facility for selectively smoothing between allophones and has circuitry for providing a selection of speech rate which is not part of this invention. Figures 3a through 3c illustrate the allophones within the allophone library 12. For example, allophone 18 is coded within ROM 12 as AW3 which is prqnounced as the a in the word saw . Allophone 80 is set in the ROM 12 as code corresponding to allophone GG which is pronounced as the g in the word bag . Pronunciation is given for all of the allophones stored in the allophone library 12. Each allophone is made up of as many as 10 frames, the frames varying from four bits for a zero energy frame, to ten bits for a repeat frame to 28 bits for a unvoiced frame to 49 bits for a voice frame . Fig. 4 illustrates this frame structure. A detailed description is present in previously mentioned United States PatentNo. 4,209,836. In this preferred embodiment, the number of frames in a given allophone is determined by a well known LPC analysis of a speaker s voice. That is, the analysis provides the breakdown of the frames required, the energy for each frame, and the reflection coefficients for each frame. This information is stored then to represent the allophone sounds set out in Figs. 3a 3c. Smoothing between certain allophones is accomplished by circuitry illustrated in Fig. 7a and 7a cont d ofU.S. Patent No. 4,209,836. In Figs. 7a and 7a cont d signal SLOW D is applied to parameter counter 513, which causes a frame width of 25MS to be slowed to 50 MS. Interpolation smoothing is performed by the circuitry shown in Figs. 9a, 9a cont d , 9b, 9b cont d over a 50 MS period when signal SLOW D is present and over a 25 MS period when signal SLOW D is absent. In the invention of U.S. Patent No. 4,209,836, a switch was set to cause slow speech through signal SLOW D. All frames were lengthened in duration. In the present invention SLOWED is present only when the last frame in an allophone is indicated by a single bit in the frame. The actual interpolation smoothing circuitry and its operation is described in detail in US. Patent 4,209,836. Figure 4 illustrates the bit formation of the allophone frame received by the 286 synthesizer 14. As shown, NSB is the end of allophone EOA bit. When EOA 1, it is the last frame in the allophone. When EOA 0, it is not the last frame in the allophone. Figure 4 illustrates a total of 50 bits including EOA for the voiced frame, 29 bits for the unvoiced frame, 11 bits for the repeat frame and 5 bits for the zero energy frame energy equal to 15. Figure 5 illustrates an allophone frame from the allophone library 12. F1 F5 are each one bit flags withF5 being the EOA bit which is transferred to the 286 synthesizer 14. The combination of flags F1 and F2 and the combination of flags F3 and F4 are shown in Fig. 7 and the meaning of those combinations set out. Figures 6a and 6b form a flowchart illustrating the details of control exerted by the 420 microcomputer 11 over, primarily, the 356 stringer 13. Beginning at word phrase , the first in, first out FIFO register of the 356 stringer 13 is initialized to receive the allophonic code from 420 microprocessor 11. Next it is determined whether the incoming information is simply a word or a phrase. It it is simply a word, then the call routine is brought up to send flag information representative of allophones, the primary stress and which vowel is the last in the word. The number of allophones is set in a countdown register and the number of allophones is sent to the 356 stringer 13. The primary stress to be given is sent, followed by the information as to which vowel is the last one in the word. Finally, a send 2 is called to send the entire 8 bits 7 bits allophone, 1 bit stress flag . It should be noted that the previous send routine involved sensing only 4 bits. A send 2 flag is set and a status command is sent to the 356 stringer 13. Then, if the 356 FIFO is ready to receive information, the FIFO is loaded. Four bits are then sent from the 420 microcomputer 11 queue register to the FIFO of the 356 stringer 13. The queue is incremented and checked to determine whether it has been emptied. If it has been emptied, there is an error. If it has not been emptied, then the send 2 flag is interrogated. If it is not set, then the routine returns to the send 2 call mentioned above. If the flag is set, then it is cleared and the next four bits are brought in to go through the same routine as indicated above. When the return is made, an execute command is sent to the 356 stringer 13 after which a status command is sent. If the 356 stringer 13 is ready, a speak command is given. If it is not ready, the status command is again sent until the stringer 13 is ready. Then the allophone is sent and the countdown register containing the number of allophones is decremented. If the countdown equals zero, the routine is again started at word phrase. If the dountdown is not equal to zero, then the send 2 routine is again called and the next allophone is brought with the procedure being repeated until the entire word has been completed. If, a phrase had been sent rather than a word, then and similar to the case of the single word, status flags are sent, and the call routine is sent, indicating first the number of words, then the primary stress, and the delta pitch. At that point the routine return to word phrase and is identical to that set out above. Figure 7a 7i form a flowchart of the details of the control of the action of the 356 stringer 13 on the allophones. Beginning in Figure 7a the starting point is to read an allophone address and then to read a frame of allophone speech data . On path 31 to Figure 7b a decision block inquiring first frame of the allophone is reached. If the answer is yes , then it is necessary to decode the flags F1 F5. If the answer is no , then it is necessary to only decode flags F3, F4 and F5. As indicated above, flags F1 and F2 determine the nature of the allophone and need not be further decoded. After the decoding, in either case, a decision block is reached where it is necessary to determine whether F3 F4 00. If the answer is yes then the energy is 0 and a decision is made as to whether F5 1, indicating the last frame in the allophone.If the answer is yes, then the decision is reached as to whether it is the last allophone. If the answer is yes , the routine has ended. If F5 is not equal to 1, then E 0 is sent to the 286 synthesizer 14 and the next frame is brought in as indicated on Figure 7a. If F5 1, and it is not the last allophone, then the information 0 and F5 1 is sent to the 286 synthesizer 14 and the next allophone is called starting at the beginning of the routine. If F3 F4 is not equal to 00, then it is determined whether F3 F4 01, indicating a 9 bit word because a repeat, using the same K parameters, is to follow. If the answer is no , then on path 32 to Fig. 6c, it is determined whether F3 F4 10, indicating 27 bits for an unvoiced frame. If the answer is yes , the first four bits are read as energy. Five bits for pitch are created as 0 and the next four bits are read as K1 K4. Then energy and pitch 0 and K1 K4 are sent to the 286 synthesizer 14. If F3 F4 10, then F3 F4 1l indicating a voiced 48 bit frame and the first four bits are read as energy, the next five bits are created as pitch and the ten K parameters are read. Turning to Fig. 7b, if it was determined that F3F4 01, then on path 33 into Fig. 7c the next four bits are read as energy, five bits space is created for pitch and repeat R 1. At this point, if F3 F4 ll or if F3 F4 01, a pitch adjustment is to be made. The inquiry base pitch 0 is made. If the answer is yes , then the speech is a whisper and pitch is set to 0. At that point, energy and pitch 0 and K1 to K4 is sent to the 286 synthesizer 14. The next frame is brought in as indicated on Fig. 7a. If the base pitch 0, then a decision is made as to whether the delta pitch 0. If the answer is yes , then the pitch is made equal to the base pitch. The energy, and pitch equal to the monotone base pitch, and the parameters Kl K10 are sent to the 286 synthesizer 14 and the next frame is brought in. If the delta pitch 0, then on path 34 into Fig. 7a it is determined whether F1 F2 00, indicating a vowel. If the answer is yes , then the question a primary in the phrase is asked. If the answer is no it is asked whether there is a secondary in the phrase. If the answer is no , then the vowel is unstressed and the question is asked is this vowel before the primary stress . If the answer is no , then on path 38 to Fig. 7c, the decision is made as to whether this is the last vowel. If the answer is no , then the decision is made as to whether it is a statement or a question type phrase. If the answer is that it is a statement, the decision is made to determine whether it is immediately after the primary stress.If the answer is no , then the pitch is made equal to the base pitch and on path 51 to Fig. 61 it is seen that path 40 returns to Fig. 79 where it is indicated that all parameters are sent to the 286 synthesizer 14.for reading and another frame is brought in. This particular path was chosen because of its simplicity of explanation. The multitude of remaining paths shown illustrate in great detail the selection of pitch at the required points. The assignment of decending or assending base pitch is shown in Figure 7h. Path 37 from Fig. 7d indicates that there is a primary stress in the particular string and if it is the last vowel, then it is determined whether the phrase is a question or statement. If it is a question, it is determined whether it is the first frame of the allophone. If the answer is yes , then pitch is assigned as indicated equal to BP D 2. If it is a statement, and it is the first frame, then pitch is assigned as BP D 2. This assignment of pitch is set out in Section 4.6 of appendix B. Figures 8a 8 e form a flow chart illustrating in detail the control by the 420 processor 11 over digitiz.er 16 and wand 17. A first time bar is an input and it then determines whether the pen wand is down. If it is, then the sync is initialized and temporary storage is initialized. The next record also is subject to these operations. If the pen is not down, then queue 2, which is the speaking queue is observed and if it is empty, then a routine returns to the call bar of Figure 6b. If queue 2 is empty, it is determined again whether the pen is down to get data. Having initialized the temporary storage, the edge of th synchronization bar is detected and it is asked whether there is a black edge . If the answer is false, then the queue 2 empty query is again made. If it is true, then sync is incremented. The question is asked whether the sync is larger than FE hexidecimal . If it is, it indicates an alarm condition, that the operator moved the wand too slowly. If it is false, then a white edge is detected. If it is not detected, the sync is again incremented until the white edge is detected at which time the contents of the sync goes to the timer counter . The timer is decremented and the question is asked whether the timer is equal zero. If the timer is not equal to zero, the timer is again decremented. If the timer is equal to zero, the question is asked whether there is a black surface.This, of course, indicates the presence of a bar and if it is true, the temporary register is incremented.In either event, the sync is loaded into the timer. The timer is again decremented and a wait is imposed until the timer equals zero. Figure 8b illustrates exactly the same procedures for three bars or the four bar code, the first bar having been discussed with respect to Figure 8a. The temporary file is then pushed on the bottom of queue 1, the organizational queue. Then a count record flag is interrogated. If it is set, then the phrase flag is set. If it is not set, the field count equals zero is interrogated. If it is not, then fields are brought in.If it is, then the count record flag is set and interrogation is made as to whether the control data least significant bit is set. If it is, then the CTL flag is set. If it is not, it is determined whether there is a word and if there is, the word flag is set. If there is not, the phrase flag is set. If the phrase flag is set, then a check sum is made equal to the contents of the temporary register. The field count is set equal to three and the check sum from queue 1 is removed. Figure 8d illustrates that the count record 1 flag is incremented because of the control data or the word questions being true. The check sum V is initialized to zero from the count rec 1 flag having been initialized or from the phrase flag having been set. The next record is then received. Figure 8e illustrates interrogating count record 1 to see if that flag has been set after having determined that the phrase flag was not set in Figure 8c. If the answer is true, then the check sum is made equal to the contents of the temporary storage. The count rec 1 flag is set to zero and the check sum is removed from queue 1, with the next record then being sought. If the count record 1 flag is not set, then the word flag is looked at and if it is set, then the field count is made equal to the temp plus 1 times 2 to indicate how many 4 bit nibbles and the count rec flag is reset. The next record is then called forth.If the word flag is not set, then the field count is made equal to the temporary register and the count rec flag is reset. The count flag rec is also reset when the check sum is removed from queue 1 as indicated on Figure 8c. The get fields input from Figure 8c is brought in and check sum V is made equal to check sum V plus the temporary count. The field count is incremented and then the field count is interrogated to determine if it is zero. If it is zero, then check sum V is interrogated to see if it is equal to check sum. If it is not, there is a fault or reject. If it is, the CTL flag is interrogated.If it is set, it is then reset permitting a process CTL control input from outside devices such as the keyboard of pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 240,692 filed March 5, 1981 entitled Keyboard Input From GraphicSymbols , assigned to the assignee of this invention. If it is not, the assembly queue 1 is down loaded to the speaking queue 2. Then the word phrase flags are reset and the next record is called forth.MODE OF OPERATION The operation of this invention is primarily shown inFigures 5 and 6a 6i. In broad terms, however, the speech producing system of this invention accepts allophonic code through the 420 microprocessor 11 shown in Figure 1. The code received is related to an address in the allophone library 12. The code is sent by the 420 microprocessor 11 to 356 stringer 13 where the address is read and the allophone is brought out when handled as indicated inFigures 6a 6i. The basic control by the 420 microprocessor 11 in causing the action by the 356 stringer 13 is shown in Fig. 5 The 286 synthesizer 14 receives the allophone parameters from the 3.56 stringer 13 and forms an analog signal representative of the allophone to the speaker 15 which then provides speech like sound. Figure 9 is a drawing of a preferred embodiment of a document having a p r i n t e d text and bar code data associated therewith in accordance with the present invention. The printed text is put on the paper in the normal manner, and then bar code data is printed directly over the text using an ink which is transparent and containing an IR absorbent. dye as previously described.The bar code data may be a direct representation of the text beneath it, or it may be commands, information about the text, or other appropriate data. The infrared absorbent ink is transparent to visible light, but highly absorbent of energy in the infrared frequency range. With this property, a sensor can detect the presence or absence of a bar code unit. An IR energy source is included in the sensor mechanism to insure that sensing of data is done with reflected energy of sufficient strength to be distinguished from stray IR sources. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the principle of a data sensing arrangement using ink containing an IR absorbent dye. The code bars are printed over text. The added thickness of perhaps .0001 inch causes no problem as far as reading the text, and data sensing is accomplished easily with an IR emitter sensor. The IR energy emitted is focused on an area the size of a bar code unit. If a certain magnitude of reflected IR energy is not detected by the sensor, a bar unit is registered by the circuitry receiving the data. For the case that enough reflected IR is detected, no bar code un.it is assumed at that location. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, text material is printed in a conventional manner on plain paper. After the next printing is complete, the transparent bar code data is printed directly over the text. The ink used to print the bar code data is transparent consisting mostly of varnish, but having an IR absorbent dye which is also transparent. With no bar code visible, the text material is easily read, and when the user desires, a sensor is passed over the text to provide an input to a host speech synthesis system su ch as illustrated in Figure 1 which ultimately produces a synthesized spoken version of the text or other desired information related to the text . This invention is clearly advantageous over current bar code storage and retrieval systems in several ways.One advantage is that the sensor does not require black to white transitions, or changes in the amount of reflected visible light, for an indication of data.Printing is usually done on white paper, the text printed with black ink to produce a good visual. contrast. The present invention avoids the visual contrast requirement by using a different energy wavelength to sense data. This different energy wavelength infrared is not affected adversely, as is visible light wavelengths, by smudges, dirt specks, and other foreign materials that absorb or reflect light. A further advantage of the invention is that with no visible bar codes, the user is not distracted or confused by the bar codes themselves. Additionally, the transparency of the bar codes allows them to be made any size necessary to insure reliable data acquisition. Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments as well as alternative embodiments of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. The manifestation of the detected code, for, example, may be visual as well as oral.It is, therefore, contemplated that the appended claims will cover any modification or embodiments that fall within the true scope of the invention.
