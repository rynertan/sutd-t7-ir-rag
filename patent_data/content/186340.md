# Method of hot extrusion.

## Abstract
An extrusion die has a die aperture which is negatively tapered essentially throughout its length at an angle X of at least 1 such that any friction stress between the die lands 20 and metal flowing through them is negligible, the length C of the lans 20 being not more than 2 mm so that fouling does not significantly take place thereon during extrusion. Faster extrusion speeds can be achieved, particularly when extruding aluminium alloy having a shear strength of from 1.2 to 4.0 Kg mmÂ² at 500 C.
