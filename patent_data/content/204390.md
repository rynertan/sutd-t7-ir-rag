# Dispersing particulate material in a stream of gas.

## Abstract
Equipment for dispersing particulate material in a stream of gas comprises a duct to contain the stream of gas, a bluff body mounted and extending transversely within the duct to create turbulence in the gas stream, and means for introduc ing particulate material immediately upstream and or down stream of the bluff body, whereby the material becomes uni formly entrained in the gas stream. The invention is of particu lar value for introducing alumina for dry scrubbing of HF containing exhaust gases from aluminium electrolytic reduc tion cells.
