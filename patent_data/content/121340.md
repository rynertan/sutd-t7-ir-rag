# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THIN FILM THICKNESS

## Abstract
The invention relates to an optical method and apparatus for instantaneously determining the thickness of thin films and particularly well suited for instantaneously measuring the thickness of semiconductor layers deposited in a deposition apparatus. The thickness is calculated from the interference pattern of a spectrogram generated when continuous wavelength illumination is reflected from the thin film. The apparatus includes a light source 52 for illuminating the thin film being measured and an analyzer 56 which provides a spectrogram of the light reflected from the thin film.
