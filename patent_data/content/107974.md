# Cistern flush valve assembly.

## Abstract
A self contained replacement flush valve assembly has an annular valve seat member 7 which is sealed to the original valve seat 4 by an elastomeric sealing ring 10 , the valve seat member 7 being clamped in position by a toggle assembly 29 mounted on a screw 25 carried by a frame 24 received in the cistern outlet tube 1 . The frame is of H shape and its upper limbs 28 are pivotally connected to the valve seat member, the lower limbs 27 having a sliding engagement with pivoted arms 32 of the toggle assembly to resist rotation of the toggle assembly. The toggle arms are pivotally retracted during insertion of the toggle assembly and frame into the outlet tube, but fall into extended positions so that on tightening the screw the arms clamp against the lower end of the outlet tube.
