# Torque motor.

## Abstract
A sector shaped support 2a1, 2a2 2b1, 2b2 is provided to a housing 3 to fixedly support a disc shaped stationary core 1 12a, 12b 17 which is provided within the housing 3 , and a coil 4a, 4b 15 is fixed to a shaft 5 14a, 14b to surround the stationary core 1 12a, 12b 17 . Magnets 7,8, 9,10 are provided within the housing 3 to impart rotational force to the coil 4a, 4b 15 . The coil 4a, 4b 15 is turned on the stationay core 1 12a, 12b 17 within a finite range, because of being stopped at the support 2a1, 2b1 2a2 2b2 for the stationary core 1 12a, 12b 17 . According to the present invention, as a torque motor can be made smaller by effectively utilizing the coil 4a, 4b 15 , there can be achieved a reduction in the size of toque motors. A torque motor of the present invention is suitable for use driving a throttle valve for automobiles.
