## Description
Novel CompoundsThe present invention relates to a modified fibrinolytic enzyme in particular modified tissue type plasminogen activator, preparation of the modified enzyme, pharmaceutical compositions containing the modified enzyme and its use in the treatment of thrombotic disease.Tissue type plasminogen activator t PA is known to have useful fibrinolytic activity. The sequence of amino acids which make up the enzyme and the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA which codes for t PA are known see e.g. Pennica et al, Nature, 1983, 301, 214 221 .However one disadvantage of the use of this enzyme in the treatment of thrombotic disease is that it can activate circulating plasminogen in addition to fibrin bound plasminogen. This may cause unwanted side effects such as indiscriminate haemorrhaging.The applicants have now identified a modified t PA enzyme which retains fibrinolytic activity but in which the activity is more specific.According to the present invention there is provided a modified tissue type plasminogen activator comprising an amino acid without a charged side chain in place of lysine at position 277.In a preferred aspect, the amino acid without a charged side chain at position 277 is isoleucine. As used herein, the term tissue type plasminogen activator denotes a plasminogen activator of the group having the immunological properties defined for t PA at the XXVIII Meeting of the International Committee onThrombosis and Haemostasis, Bergamo, Italy, 27 July 1982.The amino acid sequence of various forms of t PA are known. The abovementioned Nature 1983 reference discloses the sequence for the L chain and the matureS chain forms of t PA, also discussed by Vehar et.al., Biotechnology, 1984, 2, 1051 7 in which the processing of initially formed t PA by removal of a pro sequence to give the S chain form is reported. Pohl .awl., FEBS letters, 1984, Vol. 168 No.l, 29 32, refers to theN terminal multiplicity of t PA and discloses theU chain form. The numbering system for the amino acid sequence of t PA used herein is that described in theNature 1983 reference for mature S chain t PA in which the N terminal serine is numbered 1. By this system, L chain t PA has an N terminal glycine residue at position 3 and U chain t PA has an N terminal valine at position 4.It is understood that the tissue type plasminogen activator modified in accordance with the present invention encompasses all such variant forms.The modified t PA of the invention may be derivatised to provide pharmaceutically useful conjugates analogous to known t PA containing conjugates, for example a an enzyme protein conjugate as disclosed inEP A O 155 388, in which the catalytic site on the enzyme which is responsible for fibrinolytic activity is blocked by a human protein attached thereto by way of a reversible linking group b an enzyme protein conjugate as disclosed in EP A O 152,736, comprising at least one optionally blocked fibrinolytic enzyme linked by way of a site other than the catalytic site responsible for fibrinolytic activity to at least one human protein c a protein polymer conjugate as disclosed in co pending application no. 85308533.0 comprising a pharmaceutically useful protein linked to at least one water soluble polymer by means of a reversible linking group or d an enzyme conjugate as disclosed in co pending application no. 85308534.8 comprising a plurality of fibrinolytic enzymes linked together through the active centres thereof by means of a removable blocking group.The modified t PA of the invention may take the place of t PA as the pro enzyme or human protein component, as appropriate, of any of the conjugates described above.The modified t PA of the invention or conjugate thereof can be further derivatised such that any catalytic site essential for fibrinolytic activity is optionally blocked by a removable blocking group.The above mentioned derivatives of the modified t PA may be used in any of the methods and compositions described hereinafter for the modified t PA itself.As used herein the expression removable blocking group includes groups which are removable by hydrolysis at a rate such that the pseudo first order rate constant for hydrolysis is in the range of 10 6 sec l to 10 3 sec l in isotonic aqueous media at pH 7.4 at 370C.Such blocking groups are described in European PatentNo.0009879 and include acyl groups such as optionally substituted benzoyl or optionally substituted acryloyl.Suitable optional substituents for benzoyl blocking groups include halogen, Cl 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy, C1 6 alkanoyloxy, C16 alkanoylamino, amino or p guanidino.Suitable optional substituents for acryloyl blocking groups include Cl 0 alkyl, furyl, phenyl or C1 6 alkylphenyl.In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing modified tissue type plasminogen activator according to the invention which process comprises expressing DNA encoding said modified tissue type plasminogen activator in a recombinant host cell and recovering the modified tissue type plasminogen activator product.The DNA polymer comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the modified t PA also forms part of the invention.The process of the invention may be performed by conventional recombinant techniques such as described in Maniatis et. al., Molecular Cloning A LaboratoryManual Cold Spring Harbor, 1982.In particular, the process may comprise the steps of i preparing a replicable expression vector capable, in a host cell, of expressing a DNA polymer comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes said modified tissue type plasminogen activator ii transforming a host cell with said vector iii culturing said transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression of said DNA polymer to produce said modified tissue type plasminogen activator and iv recovering said modified tissue type plasminogen activator. The invention also provides a process for preparing theDNA polymer by the condensation of appropriate mono , di or oligomeric nucleotide units.The preparation may be carried out chemically, enzymatically, or by a combination of the two methods, in vitro or in vivo as appropriate. Thus, the DNA polymer may be prepared by the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesised DNA fragments, by conventional methods such as those described by D. M. Roberts et al in Biochemistry 1985, 24, 5090 5098. The chemical synthesis may be performed generally as described hereinafter for the synthesis of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Enzymatic polymerisation ofDNA may be carried out in vitro using a DNA polymerase such as DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment in an appropriate buffer containing the nucleoside triphosphates dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP as required at a temperature of 100 370C, generally in a volume of 50p1 or less.Enzymatic ligation of DNA fragments may be carried out using a DNA ligase such as T4 DNA ligase in an appropriate buffer at a temperature of 40C to ambient, generally in a volume of 50yl or less. DNA polymer which encodes the modified t PA may be prepared by site directed mutagenesis of the cDNA which codes for tissue type plasminogen activator, by conventional methods such as those described by G. Winter et al inNature 1982, 299, 756 758 or by Zoller and Smith 1982 Nucl. Acids Res., 10, 6487 6500.The site directed mutagenesis may be effected by means of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide which is complementary or corresponds to tissue type plasminogen activator cDNA in the region on either side of the codon formed by the nucleotides 1018 1020 but which mismatches in the region 1018 1020 such that the triplet of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide in the mismatch region is complementary or corresponds to a codon which encodes an amino acid without a charged side chain.The oligodeoxyribonucleotide also forms part of the invention.According to the present invention there is further provided a process for preparing a modified tissue type plasminogen activator enzyme, which process comprises effecting a site directed mutagenesis upon the cDNA which codes for tissue type plasminogen activator using an oligonucleotide which is complementary or corresponds to the t PA cDNA in the region on either side of the codon formed by the nucleotides 1018 1020 but which mismatches in the region 1018 1020 such that cDNA is produced which contains a codon suitable for producing an amino acid without a charged side chain at this position and expressing the modified cDNA in a prokaryote or eukaryote host.Further according to the present invention there is provided modified tissue type plasminogen activator obtained by the above described process.In a preferred aspect, the triplet in the mismatch region of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide is complementary or corresponds to a codon which encodes isoleucine.The invention also provides a process for preparing an oligodeoxyribonucleotide of the invention, which process comprises the deprotection of a second oligodeoxyribonucleotide having the same sequence of bases as said oligodeoxyribonucleotide and in which all free hydroxy and amino groups are protected.The oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in the process can be prepared by conventional phosphotriester, phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry, using solid phase techniques such as those described in Chemical andEnzymatic Synthesis of Gene Fragments A LaboratoryManual ed. H.G. Gassen and A. Lang , Verlag Chemie,Weinheim 1982 ,or in other scientific publications, for example M.J. Gait, H.W.D. Matthes, M. Singh, B.S.Sproat, and R.C. Titmas, Nucleic Acids Research, 1982, 10, 6243 B.S. Sproat and W. Bannwarth, TetrahedronLetters, 1983, 24, 5771 M.D. Matteucci and M.HCaruthers, Tetrahedron Letters, 1980, 21, 719 M.D.Matteucci and M.H. Caruthers, Journal of the AmericanChemical Society, 1981, 103, 3185 S.P. Adams et al.,Journal of the American Chemical Society,1983, 105, 661 N.D. Sinha, J. Biernat, J. McMannus, and H. Koester, Nucleic Acids Research, 1984, 12, 4539 and H.W.D. Matthes et al., EMBO Journal, 1984, 3, 801.Solid supports which may be employed include conventional supports known in the art, for example kieselguhr polydimethylacrylamide, silica, controlled pore glass, or cellulose paper discs. The base at the 3 end of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide to be prepared is attached, via a spacer group connected to the 3 oxygen of the terminal 2 deoxyribose unit, to the solid support and assembly of the oligodeoxyribo nucleotide in a protected form is carried out in the 3 5 direction by cycles of synthesis, the required operations being performed either manually or by an automated instrument.At the end of the synthesis, the protected oligodeoxyribonucleotide may be cleaved from the solid support either before, after, or at the same time as other deprotection steps that are carried out once the desired sequence of bases has been assembled, as described hereinbelow. Conveniently the oligodeoxyribonucleotide is removed from the solid support by treatment with a basic reagent such as aqueous ammonia at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, or with 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl guanidinium syn 2 nitrobenza ldoximate or similar reagents in aqueous dioxan at ambient or slightly elevated temperature.Alternatively, the preparation may be carried out conventionally by phosphotriester chemistry in solution as described, for example, by C.B. Reese, Tetrahedron, 1978, 34, 3143 3179. The required sequence of nucleotide bases in the oligodeoxyribonucleotide may be built up conventionally, for example as described in the aforementioned publications, by the condensation of appropriate mono , di or oligomeric nucleotide units in the presence of a suitable condensing agent such as l mesitylenesulphonyl 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazole in a solvent such as pyridine at ambient or slightly elevated temperature when phosphotriester chemistry is employed or by a condensing agent such as tetrazole in acetonitrile at ambient temperature when phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry is used . Optionally a capping step is introduced after each condensation step to inactivate any unreacted starting material containing a free 5 hydroxy group.Such a capping step may suitably be carried out by an acylating agent such as acetic anhydride in 2,6 lutidine and 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. When phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry is employed, the phosphorus III atom in the phosphite triester internucleotide linkage created in each condensation step is oxidised, giving the corresponding phosphotriester linkage, before a further condensation step is carried out. Such oxidations may be carried out using a convenient oxidising agent, for example iodine in aqueous tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as lutidine. The oxidation step is conveniently carried out after the optional capping step as hereinbefore described.During the synthesis of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide, the hydroxy groups in each of the internucleotide phosphodiester bridges may be protected by an aryl group or alkyl group conventionally employed for the purpose, for example 2 or 4 chlorophenyl, methyl, or 2 cyanoethyl, to prevent branching of the molecule.The aryl protecting groups are removed at the end of the synthesis by treatment with an agent conventionally employed for the purpose, for example 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl guanidinium syn 2 nitrobenzaldoximate in an aqueous solvent such as aqueous dioxan at ambient temperature. The methyl groups may be removed at the end of the synthesis by treatment with triethylammonium thiophenolate in dioxan at ambient temperature. The 2 cyanoethyl groups may be removed at the end of the synthesis with a basic reagent such as triethylamine or tert butylamine in pyridine at ambient temperature, or alternatively by treatment with concentrated aqueous ammonia at about 500C a step which simultaneously and advantageously removes the protecting groups present on the A, C and G bases as described hereinbelow .The amino groups present in the A, C and G bases are protected by base labile protecting groups, such as benzoyl for A and C, and isobutyryl for G. Such groups may be removed by treatment with basic reagents, for example ammonia at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example 500C. The 5 hydroxy group of the terminal ribose moiety is protected by an acidlabile group such as trityl, 4,4 dimethoxytrityl or pixyl 9 phenyl 9 xanthyl , which is removed before each condensation step and at the end of synthesis.Such groups may be removed by treatment with an acidic reagent such as di or trichloroacetic acid in an anhydrous solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform, at ambient temperature. The expression of the DNA polymer encoding the modified t PA in a recombinant host cell may be carried out by means of a replicable expression vector capable, in the host cell, of expressing the DNA polymer. The expression vector is novel and also forms part of the invention.The replicable expression vector may be prepared in accordance with the invention, by cleaving a vector compatible with the host cell to provide a linear DNA segment having an intact replicon, and combining said linear segment with the DNA polymer encoding the modified t PA under ligating conditions.The choice of vector will be determined in part by the host cell, which may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic.Suitable vectors include plasmids and bacteriophages. The preparation of the replicable expression vector may be carried out conventionally with appropriate enzymes for restriction, polymerisation and ligation of theDNA, by procedures described in, for example, Maniatis et al cited above. Polymerisation and ligation may be performed as described above for the preparation of theDNA polymer. Digestion with restriction enzymes may be performed in an appropriate buffer at a temperature of 200 700C, generally in a volume of 50p1 or less with 0.1 10pg DNA.The recombinant host cell is prepared, in accordance with the invention, by transforming a host cell with a replicable expression vector of the invention under transforming conditions. Suitable transforming conditions are conventional and are described in, for example, Maniatis et al cited above, or DNA Cloning Vol. II, D.M. Glover ed., IRL Press Ltd, 1985. The choice of transforming conditions is determined by the host cell. Thus, a bacterial host such as E. coli may be treated with a solution of CaC12 Cohen et al,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1973, 69, 2110 or with a solution comprising a mixture of RbCl, MnC12, potassium acetate and glycerol, and then with 3 N morpholino3 propane sulphonic acid, RbCl and glycerol. Mammalian cells in culture may be transformed by calcium co precipitation of the vector DNA onto the cells.The invention also extends to a host cell transformed with a replicable expression vector of the invention.Culturing the transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression of the DNA polymer is carried out conventionally, as described in, for example, Maniatis et al and DNA Cloning cited above. Thus, preferably the cell is supplied with nutrient and cultured at a temperature below 450CThe modified t PA expression product is recovered by conventional methods according to the host cell. Thus, where the host cell is bacterial, such as E. coli it may be lysed physically, chemically or enzymatically and the protein product isolated from the resulting lysate. Where the host cell is mammalian, the product may generally be isolated from the nutrient medium.The DNA polymer may be assembled into vectors designed for isolation of stable transformed mammalian cell lines expressing the modified t PA e.g. bovine papillomavirus vectors DNA cloning Vol.II D.M. GloverEd. IRL Press 1985 Kaufman, R.J. et al, Molecular andCellular Biology 5, 1750 1759, 1985 Pavlakis G.N. andHamer, D.H., Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences USA 80, 397 401, 1983 Goeddel, D.V. et al.,European Patent Application No. 0093619, 1983 . It will be appreciated that, depending upon the host cell, the modified t PA prepared in accordance with the invention may be glycosylated to varying degrees.Furthermore, as observed by Pohl et.al., Biochemistry, 1984, 23., 3701 3707, varying degress of glycosylation may also be found in unmodified, naturally occurring t PA. The modified t PA of the invention is understood to include such glycosylated variations. A particularly useful oligodeoxyribonucleotide for use in the process is of sequence I 5ld AGCCCTCCTATGATGC 3 I The oligodeoxyribonucleotide of sequence I is novel and as such forms part of the invention.The oligodeoxyribonucleotide of sequence I is complementary to the nucleotides 1013 1028 inclusive of t PA cDNA except for one mismatch at the nucleotide at position 1019. The codon at position 1018 1020 has thus been changed from AAA to ATA. Consequently it is believed that the cDNA obtained following mutagenesis is substantially similar to the cDNA reported byPennica et al 1983 with the following new sequence EMI13.1 changedExpression of the cDNA is believed to give rise to t PA in which the amino acid sequence is changed from position 275 277 280 arg ile lys gly gly leu to position 275 277 280 arg ile ile gly gly leu The modified t PA of the invention is preferably administered as a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of thrombotic disease.Accordingly the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising modified t PA of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.The compositions according to the invention may be formulated in accordance with routine procedures as pharmaceutical compositions adapted for intravenous administration to human beings.Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions of the sterile modified t PA in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilising agent to keep the modified t PA in solution and a local anaesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of injection. Generally, the modified t PA will be supplied in unit dosage form for example as a dry powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of protein in activity units.Where the modified t PA includes a removable blocking group an indication of the time within which the free protein will be liberated may be given. Where the protein is to be administered by infusion, it will be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade Water for Injection or saline.Where the protein is to be administered by injection, it is dispensed with an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline. The injectable or infusable composition will be made up by mixing the ingredients prior to administration.The quantity of material administered will depend upon the amount of fibrinolysis required and the speed with which it is required, the seriousness of the thromboembolic condition and position and size of the clot. The precise dose to be employed and mode of administration must per force in view of the nature of the complaint be decided according to the circumstances by the physician supervising treatment. However, in general, a patient being treated for a thrombus will generally receive a daily dose of from 0.01 to 3.0 mg kg l of body weight either by injection or by infusion.Within the above indicated dosage range, no adverse toxicological effects are indicated with the compounds of the invention.Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating thrombotic diseases, which comprises administering to the sufferer an effective non toxic amount of modified t PA of the invention.The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 5 d AGCCCTCCTATGATGC 3 The above mentioned 16 mer hexadecamer was prepared by the solid phase phosphotriester method on a polydimethylacrylamide kieselguhr support using monomer building blocks following the standard procedure described in Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of GeneFragments A Laboratory Manual ed.

Glycerol shock and lOmM butyrate treatment were used Following transfection the cells were rested overnight in growth mediumOverlay Agarose Indubiose A37 , 2.4g in 95ml EaglesMEM Gibco heated to melting point in a bunsen flame, was then placed in a water bath maintained at 480C. 5.6 ml of fibrinogen 20mg ml were diluted 1 1 with 5.6 ml of Eagles MEM containing an extra 7 mg ml ofNaCl and retained on ice. 3.3 ml of Eagles MEM no additions were aliquoted into a bijou containing 86 1 of bovine thrombin at 50 NIH Units ml retained on ice . The cells were washed 3 times with Eagles MEM to remove serum. The thrombin and fibrinogen were warmed to 370C in a water bath. 9.5 ml agarose were aliquoted into a pre warmed universal. The thrombin was added to the agar, followed by the fibrinogen. The gel was poured over the cell layer and incubated at 370C until lysis zones appeared.Preparation of modified t PA from bacterial extractsModified t PA was extracted from cultures of E. coli JM101 pTRB8 using a procedure based on that described by Heynecker et al, 1983 European Patent ApplicationNo. 0092182 for the extraction of active urokinase fromE. coli cells. 10ml prewarmed L broth 5g NaCl, 5gYeast Extract, lOg Tryptone litre of water containing 50zg ml ampicillin, were inoculated with 100pl of a standing overnight culture of E. coli JM101 pTRB8 and incubated, with aeration, at 370C until the A550 0.5.Expression of modified t PA was then induced withO.lmM IPTG isopropyl µ3 D thiogalactopyranoside and ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.5mM to minimise bacterial protease activity Gross et al,Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 825, 207 213, 1985 . Growth was continued for a further 2h final A550 1.0 1.2 and the cells placed in an ice bath. The cells were harvested, washed once with 1 volume ice cold lOmM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and the pellet resuspended in lml lysis buffer 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 50mM EDTA, 2mg ml lysozyme . After 30 min at OoC, 3 ml 6M guanidine HC1, 50mM Tris pH 8.0 were added and mixed well.The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 30 mins at 40C and the supernatant decanted and incubated at 240C for 30 mins. The solution was subsequently diluted to 1M guanidine HC1, 50mM Tris pH 9.0 and made 2mM reduced glutathione GSH , 0.2mM oxidized glutathione GSSG . This redox mixture was incubated at 140C for 16h and then dialysed against 50mM Tris pH 9.5, 250mM NaCI, 0.25mM EDTA, 0.01 Tween for 8h one change of buffer . 10pl of the dialysed extract were placed onto a fibrin plate Robinson, J. Thrombos.Res. 1984 33, 155 62 together with standards.Example 2Change in t PA DNA sequenceDNA coding for a novel, modified t PA protein has been produced using the above mentioned oligonucleotide Example I with sequence 5 d A G C C C T C C T A T G A T G C 3 This oligonucleotide is complementary to nucleotides 1013 1028 inclusive of t PA cDNA Pennica et al,Nature, 1983, 301, 214 221 except for one mismatch at position 1019. The codon at position 1018 1020 has thus been changed from AAA to ATA. The resulting DNA sequence has been expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell systems to give a novel fibrinolytically active protein.All manipulation of the DNA referred to below was carried out as described in the Methods Section. A cDNA clone coding for the protein t PA was isolated from m4A prepared from the TRBM6 cell line described in Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 1985, 54, 422 424. The 2kb BglII fragment encoding the mature t PA cDNA sequence was isolated, blunt ended and subcloned into M13 mplO Amersham International PLC Prod. No. N.4536 at the SalI site which had also been blunt ended.Clones were isolated with the insert in both orientations. The two types of clone will henceforth be known as mTR10 and mTR20. One of these, mTR20, placed the t PA cDNA insert in frame and in the correct orientation, to allow expression of a t PA fusion protein from the lacZ promoter in the M13 mplO genome Slocombe et al, 1982, P.N.A.S. 79, 5455 5459 .This construct did not give good yields of either single or double stranded DNA.The t PA cDNA was put out of reading frame by cutting double stranded DNA from the clone mTR10 with the enzymes BamHI and HindIII. The whole DNA mixture comprising the cleaved vector DNA and the t PA insertDNA was blunt ended and religated. The resulting construct was shown by DNA sequencing to have the following structure at the point of insertion indicating that the t PA cDNA is out of reading frame with respect to the M13 lacZ promoter. mplO derived sequence t PA sequence 5 GGG GAT CAG CTT GGG CTG CAG GTC GAEMI25.1 GA TCT 3 EMI25.2 transcriptionBglII This clone will be known as mTR30. Site directed mutagenesis was carried out on the clone mTR30 as described in Methods. After screening, five duplicate positive signals were selected. DNA sequencing was carried out on single stranded DNA from the five isolates and all clearly showed a changed DNA sequence. An example of this changed DNA sequence from the mutant clone mTR40 is shown in Fig. 3.The tracks shown in Fig. 3, I, III represent terminations at all positions where the base A is present in the DNA sequence. The tracks shown in Fig.3, II, IV represent terminations at all positions where the base T is present in the DNA sequence. Fig. 3, tracks I, II are derived from normal t PA DNA. Fig. 3,III, IV are derived from the novel t PA DNA. In each case the triplet 1018 1020 is indicated. The change from the sequence AAA to ATA was therefore confirmed. Example 3Bacterial Expression of modified t PA DNAThe 2kb BglII fragment carrying the modified t PA sequence was excised from mTR40 by restriction withBglII. This was subsequently ligated with BamHI cut pUC8. Competent E. coli JM101 cells were transformed with O.lpg ligated DNA and after a 60 min incubation inL broth LB to allow expression of plasmid encoded 13 lactamase, transformants were selected on L agar LB 1.5 Bacto agar incorporating ampicillin at 50pg ml and X gal 5 bromo, 4 chloro, 3 indolyl R D galactopyranoside a chromogenic 3 galactosidase substrate, at 20pg ml. Several white colonies were purified and screened for the presence of the required recombinant plasmid 4.7kb .This was carried out by preparing plasmid mini preps based on the procedure ofBirnboim and Doly, 1979, Nucleic Acids Research 7 6 p1513 1523 . Those isolates demonstrated to be carrying a 4.7kb plasmid were restricted with SmaI to determine the orientation of the modified sequence with respect to the lacZ promoter of the pUC8 vector. One recombinant shown to carry the BglII fragment in the correct orientation for expression of the modified t PA sequence was chosen for further study. This expression plasmid, pTRB8, has the structure shown in Fig.4.Modified t PA was expressed from the fused lacZ t PA coding DNA in E. coli JM101 as described in the methods section. Analysis of the dialysed extract reveals a major band of fibrinolytic activity apparently identical in size to unmodified material from E. coli using the described protocol Fig.5 . Several bands of lower apparent molecular weight are visible on zymography of modified and unmodified material, these are believed to be either degradation products or the result of internal translation initiation events on the mRNA template. No fibrinolytic activity was detected in extracts from E. coli JM101 pTRB9 a plasmid construction carrying the modified t PA sequence in the opposite orientation with respect to the lacZ promoter of the vector . Example 4Transient Expression of modified t PA DNA in EukaryoticCellsA. Vector ConstructionThe vector pRSV D globin Gorman et al, Science, 221, 551 553, 1983 was modified to allow the insertion and expression of t PA cDNA see Fig.6 . The globin sequences were removed by digesting lO g of pRSV R globin DNA with 20 units each of XindIII and BglII for 2h and isolating the large DNA fragment from a 1 low melting point agarose gel as described in the methods section. The 5 globin sequences were replaced with aDNA fragment encoding the 5 region of the cDNA from XTR10 which is a AgtlO cDNA clone DNA Cloning, Vol.1, chapters 2 and 3, Ed. D.M.Glover, IRL press, 1985 constructed using TRBM6 cell messenger RNA Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 1985, 54, 422 424 . The cDNA insert in the XTR10 encodes the 5 untranslated region, prepro sequences and mature protein sequences up to the EcoRI site equivalent to base 801 Pennica et al, Nature, 1983, 301, 214 221 . The cDNA insert was cleaved from the vector by digestion of 5pg of DNA with 24 units ofEcoRI for 1.5h. The DNA was then extracted with phenol chloroform, ethanol precipitated, resuspended, blunt ended and ligated to kinased HindIII linkers as described in the Methods section. Ligation of linkers was at ambient temperature for 7 hours then overnight at 40C.The DNA was then digested with 20 units ofHindIII for 2 hours and a 800bp fragment corresponding to the HindIII linkered t PA cDNA was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 low melting point agarose gel.This 800bp fragment was mixed with the large DNA fragment derived from pRSV R globin described above and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was resuspended and digested with 10 units each of HindIII and BglII for 1.7h, phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended and ligated as described in the methods section for 5h at ambient temperature and overnight at 40C. 2pl of DNA was used to transformE. coli HB101 and colonies carrying plasmids containing the 5 end of the t PA cDNA up to the BglII site equivalent to that numbered 187 in Pennica et al Nature, 1983, 301, 214 221 , were identified byHindIII BglII digestion of plasmid mini preps and the plasmid named pTREl.The sequences encoding the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat RSV LTR , 5 region of t PA cDNA, andSimian virus 40 SV40 3 sequences were then reconstructed in pAT153 in such a way that they formed a single XhoI fragment. Firstly, the RSV LTR was removed from pRSV D globin by digestion of 6pg DNA with 4U of SfaNI for 2.5h. The DNA was then phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended and blunt ended. XhoI linkers were kinased and ligated to the DNA at ambient temperature for 8h and overnight at 40C, then incubated at 700C for 15 minutes to inactivate the ligase and ethanol precipitated.The linkered DNA was then resuspended and digested with 15 units each of HindIII and XhoI for 6h and a 500 bp fragment corresponding to the RSV LTR isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This DNA fragment was cloned into pAT153 prepared as follows 6pg of pAT153 was digested with 30U of EcoRI for 2h, then phenol chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was resuspended, blunt ended, ligated to XhoI linkers, resuspended and digested with HindIII and XhoI as above. A 3.4kb fragment was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel and ethanol precipitated with the L 500bp fragment above. The DNA was ligated to give pTREO.The r0.2kb fragment encoding the 5 part of the t PA cDNA was isolated from pTREl by digesting lO g of DNA with 30 units each of HindIII and BglII for 2 hours and the fragment isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This fragment was cloned into pAT153 prepared as follows 5pg of pAT153 was digested to completion with BamHI. Following phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and blunt ended then ligated to kinasedBglII linkers. The DNA was phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended and digested with 30 units each of HindIII and BglII for 3h.The large DNA band was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel, ethanol precipitated with the 0.2kb fragment above and ligated together to give pTRE8. A DNA fragment encoding the SV40 sequences from pTREl was isolated as follows sug of pTREl was digested with 60 units of EcoRI for 2h, blunt ended and ligated toXhoI linkers as described previously. After phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and digested sequentially withBglII and XhoI. A I.6kb band encoding the SV40 sequences was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel and cloned into pTRE8 prepared as follows pg of pTRE8 was digested with 15 units ofSalI for 3Xh, blunt ended and ligated to XhoI linkers as described previously.Following phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and digested sequentiaily with 30 units ofBglII for lh and 10 units XhoI for 2h. The large DNA band was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel, ethanol precipitated with the 1.6kb fragment above and ligated to give pTREll.A 2kb DNA fragment encoding the 5 t PA cDNA sequences, SV40 sequences and part of pAT153 were cleaved from pTREll by digestion of 5pg DNA with 30 units HindIII and 6 units XmaIII for 6h. After electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel a c2kb band was isolated and cloned into pTREO prepared as follows 4.8nag pTRE0 was digested with HindIII and XmaIII as above and the large DNA fragment isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This fragment was ethanol precipitated with the 2kb fragment above and ligated to give pTRE12.t PA cDNA BglII fragments were cloned into the uniqueBglII site of pTRE12 as shown in Figure 7. pTRE7 contains a 2kb BglII fragment, encoding the mature t PA protein and part of the 3 untranslated region, derived from a cDNA library produced from TRBM6 cells, Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 1985, 54, 422 424 , cloned into the unique BglII site of pTREl. 5pg of pTRE7 was digested to completion with BglII and the 2kb fragment isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This was ethanol precipitated and ligated with pTRE12, previously digested with BglII and phosphatased as described in the methods section, to give pTRE15 which expresses wild type t PA. mTR40 was digested with BglII and a 2kb fragment isolated and cloned into pTRE12 as described above to give pTRE18 which expresses mutated t PA. B. Fibrin agar overlayExpression of modified and unmodified t PA from transfected mouse C127 cells 24 hours post transfection was detected using the fibrin agarose overlay technique as described in theMethods section.
