## Description
RECIPROCABLE IMPRINTING APPARATUS This invention relates generally to article imprinting apparatus for imprinting information upon packages, cartons and the like as they travel successively spaced along the reach of a conveyor. More particularly, there is provided an improved impact type reciprocating imprinting apparatus which is more durable and versatile and less costly to fabricate, assemble and maintain than prior devices, which enables the employment of pre inked ink cartridges and markededly increases the useful life thereof by having means for effecting sealing off of the cartridges during all but the actual imprinting stroke of the asparatu In particular, the apparatus provided by the invention includes an imprinting head carrying a biased releasably mounted type holder on which type font can be secured.An effective seal is established between the imprinting head and a disposable inking cartridge to prevent evaporative loss from the cartridge, except during the momentary translation of the head along a path leading to an angularly displaced imprinting location whereat the imprinting is performed. Drive and guide idler linkage means are provided to direct the imprinting head along said path in an imprinting stroke and a return stroke to resume the sealed engagJe9ment, Known devices capable of imprinting information upon surfaces of packages, cartons and the like conveyed spaced along a given path along the reach of the conveyor generally are of complex construction with accompanying expense of manufacture, fabrication, assembly and maintenance, Two major types of deyices are employed in imprinting indiciacnpackages and the like.One type of device includes a rotary imprinting wheel on which the type font can be mounted for repeated inking by rotary ink transfer means to which ink is supplied from a source t1e 6f, the imprinting wheel intercepting the article to be imprinted. The second major type of imprinting apparatus involves stamping or impacting inked type face means repeatedly upon successively arriving articles. type face means is supplied with ink by impacting the type. face means upon an ink saturated pad or the like, usually supplied by some storage means such as cartridge or the like, which include an ink impervious body having a window through which access to the ink impregnated pad is enabled. The invention herein is concerned with the repeatable impact type imprinting apparatus involves substantial frequency of required maintenance and particularly the short life of the inking means employed.Frequent and time consuming ink cartridge replacement is the rule. One reason for such short cartridge useful life may be attributed to the unusually fast .drying character of the ink employed. These highly volatile inks evaporate rapidly, usually depleting the ink pad after only a short time or leaving an inking surface which quickly becomes hard and dry, preventing the normal cappilarity effect to resupply the surface of the pad.This phenomenon is encountered where the ink supply takes the form of an ink saturated absorbent pad disposed within a disposable cartridge having access window means to accommodate the printing head. Often, the skin formed.by solvent evaporation is hard whereby ink is unevenly applied to the type font, or at least, is insufficient to effect uniform marking of the package, etc. During the course of the operation of the imprinting apparatus, the imprinting head is disposed substantially longer at the rest condition, engaged against the inking pad surface. The translation of the imprinting head to the imprinting location and application of the imprint occupies minimal time and requires little exposure of the inking pad. Nevertheless, substantial reduction of the effectiveness of the inking means results since evaporation, etc, occurs while the type holder carried by the imprinting head is engaged with the inking pad of the ink storing cartridge. Seals have been attempted with mixed results,Some attempts have interfered with the inking of the type font while others have been ineffective, failing to establish an effective seal. It should be noted that the ink saturated pad is generally resilient because of its saturated condition and the character of the ink absorbent material used to form the pad. The area of engagement of the imprinting head as well as the surface of the head engaging the pad is sometimes so resilient as to fail to establish an effective seal. The type holder seated on the imprinting head and effectively constituting same also is not well suited to make a proper seal with the ink saturated pad or its surrounding border defining lining member, where provided.Accordingly, rapid evaporation of the fast drying ink still materially reduces the useful life of available cartridges requiring removal of the exhausted cartridge and replacement with √Öa fresh cartridge Often such premature disabling of the ink supply cartridges occurs many times during a normal average imprijri.tin..5 run regardless of the nurriber of articles imprinted. Another problem encountered with the employment of imprinting apparatus of the type described hereinabove involves the formation of a hard skin formed on the pad as a result of evaporation. The skin prevents transfer of ink from the pad, even though there is.substantial ink remainent within the impregnated storing pad This results in premature removal and replacement of the cartridge long prior to depletion of the ink storedtherein, Still another difficulty encountered with a marking device such as described above involves the means employed to effect the translation of the imprinting head to the imprinting position and return. It is known to employ pivotable arms and the like to mount an imprinting head for repeated movement.Ordinarily, these arms are coupled to a source of dynamic power, such as a fluid operated hydraulic or pneumatic. system coupled through a signalling device to a drive arm, in turn secured to an imprinting head and or to the mounting therefor.Known drives cause the imprinting head to be translated from its rest condition to its angularly displaced position at the imprinting location, so that the imprinting head assumes an orientation with its center line perpendicular to the surface upon which imprinting is to be effected. It is difficult to maintain the head in the proper path to prevent deviation therefrom during translation to and return from the imprinting location.There has been considerable difficulty in achieving the proper orientation of said imprinting head as well as in controlling the contact pressure exerted by the imprinting head both upon the package surface and upon the inksaturated pad. Where the contact pressure at impact is too great, smearing and or other blurring of the imprint would be encountered. Often the imprinting head would be misoriented during its imprinting contact with the package surface, resulting in partial imprints, or imprints carrying too much ink, notwithstanding the fast drying nature of the inks employed. The return stroke often strongly impacts in the relatively soft, yieldable surface of the ink satureited pad whereby to cause splashing of ink fouling the apparatus, the imprinting head and carrier therefor, and often causing ink to be thrown outward, fouling the ambient surroundings. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to prevent the above adverse occurrances in a relatively simply constructed marking apparatus, and to include therein, means to prevent evaporative loss by establishing an effective sealed engagement between the ink cartridge and the printing head during all but the actual imprinting. Another way of reducing ink loss is to control the impact or contact pressure exercised by the imprinting head the type face carried thereby upon the saturated inking pad. Often one had to elect between a contact pressure at impact sufficient to assure proper inking and reduction of contact pressure to prevent splashing of ink. Control of the quantity of ink applied to the type font during each inking step has been found to be difficult. Too much ink applied to the type will result in smearing of the imprint. Applying too little ink will result in unsatisfactory faint imprints. Additionally, the force of impact upon the surface to be imprinted should be carefully controlled to assure proper clear and sharply defined imprints. Effecting of such controls as applied to the mechanical drive means is expensive and less than satisfactory. The translation of the imprinting head between the pair of angularly displaced operating positions should be effected by mechanisms which are relatively simple in construction and are effective to assure proper orientation of the type carried by the imprinting head both on the ink saturated pad during the rest condition, and during the time period when momentarily displaced therefrom to effect application of the imprint. Facility in servicing the imprinting apparatus also is a desirable feature not readily available with known imprinting devices of this type. Particularly, removability of both the inking cartridge and the type holder for replacement, change or reorientation would be highly desirable. In view of the relative complexity of available imprinting apparatus of the type described, there has been a considerable and long felt need to effect reductions in the costs of fabricating, assembly and maintenance without reduction in efficiency and with achieving increased versatility of the apparatus. it also would he highily des.ahle to provide a marking apparatus which ts versatile and capable of being mounted for operation universally in a a plurality of orientations with facility and with efficienty and a minimum of maintenance downtime. in addition, it would be highly advantageous to provide an intermittent impact reciprocable type imprinting apparatus which is capable of operation at relatively high speed without loss in effectiveness. Another improvement desired over the knowen apparatus is to provide for ad justment of the imprint distance relative to article being imprinted so that the installation mounting of the imprinting apparaturs ned not be changed raised or lowered to compensate for small chngas. in. height of the articles Accordingly, the invention, provides an article imprinting apparatus. including an imprinting head carrying type font for applying an imprint to the surface of an object characteried by an inking cartridge having an exposed inking surface engagea,ble by said type font during a rest condition, a drive for translating said imprinting head in an imprinting stroke and a return stroke between the rest condition and an imprinting position angularly displaced from the inking cartridge simultaneously rotating said imprinting head through approximately 90 of rotation, link members coupled between said drive and the imprinting head for effecting said translation, and a guide defining a path of travel for sd imprinting head from a vertically oriented condition engaged with said inking surface to a horizontally oriented condition at the imprinting position and return and assuring proper orientation of said imprinting head at said rest condition and at the imprinting position respectively. I he invention further provides the apparatus characterized in that said link members comprise a drive linkage pivotally secured to the imprinting head and to a fluid pressure operated plunger, an idler link having first and second ends, aid first end being pivoLally secured to said imprinting head at a location adjacent the securement of said drive linkage, a stationary mounting within the apparatus for pivotally se curin.g the second end of tW iller link and secondary pivot mounting coupled to said drive linkage offset from the pivoLal coupling of said drive linkage to said plunger, said drive linkage being actuatable by said plunger for effecting pivotal movement about said secondary pivot simultaneously with. pivotal movement of or the idler link, ball further, the invention provides the appa us characterized by said guide comprising a cam and follower defining a path for the imprinting head strokes which will cause said head to move. at a substantially constant angular acceleration through the midpath of the strokes, the rate of rotation being maximum at the midpaths of the strokes, the rate of rotation being maximum at the midpaths of the strokes and minimum adjacent the ends of the strokes, The preferred embodiments of this i yv now will be described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings accompanying this specification in which FIGURE 1 is a top perspective view or tne article imprinting apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention and viewed installed on a conveyor frame in proximity to articles to be imprinted FIGURE 2 is an exploded top perspective view of the article imprinting apparatus illustrated inFIGURE 1 shown disassembled from the conveyor aind in the process of being loaded with an inking cartridge, portions of the apparatus being broken away to show interior detail FIGURE 3 is an enlarged elevational view of the imprinting apparatus of FIGURE 1 with portions deleted and shown partially in section, to show interior details FIGURE 4 is a bottom perspective view of the imprinting apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 2, portions of same being deleted to show interior detail, FIGURE 5 is a top plan view of the article imprinting apparatus of FIGURE 1, portions being broken away to show interior detail FIGURE 6 is a sectional detail taken along lines 6 6 of FIGURE 5 viewed in the direction indicated FIGURE 7 is a sectional detail similar to that ofFIGURE 6 but illustrating a modified embodiment of the invention and FIGURE 8 is a perspective exploded detail representative of the imprinting head and type carrier holder according to the invention illustrating the novel mounting of the holder and the manner of disassembly, thereof. FIGURE 9 is a top perspective yew of the article imprintin.g apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention and viewed installed on a conveyor frame in proximity to articles to be imprinted FIGURE 1Q is an exploded top perspective view of the article imprinting apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 9 shown disassembled from the conveyor and in the process of being loaded with an inking cartridge, portions of the apparatus being broken away to show interior detail FIGURE 11 is a bottom perspective view of the imprinting apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 10, portionsOf same being deleted to show ui.terior detail, FIGURE 12is an anlarged elevational view of the imprinting apparatus of FIGURE 9 with portions deleted and shown partially in section, to show interior detailes. The invention herein provides an intermittent impact type imprinting apparatus for applying imprint imformation upon a facing surface of packages, cartons, and the like conveyed spaced along a given path along the reach of a conveyor. An imprinting head is positioned adjustably for intermittent translation between a rest condition sealingly engaged with the surface of an ink saturated medium in the form of a removable prinked ink storing cartridge and an angularly spaced imprinting position effected by a signal controlled pressurized fluid operated drive system so that the imprinting head contacts the surface of the article to be imprinted. The imprinting head is translated between these two positions by a drive linkage coupled to said fluid operated system and is guided by a secondary linkage functioning as an idler linkage. Both linkages are independently pivotally journalled with the imprinting head to define a folding linkage. The imprinting head includes a shuttle arm carrying shaftmeans to which the linkages are coupled. The shuttle has a cam shaped free end and an enlarged head carrying the type means.The free end isadapted to engage an intercepting guide member for assuring that the folding relationship of the link members of the folded linkage is such as to cause the center line of the shuttle to assume a vertically normal orientation ninety degrees from its orientation in the rest condition with the enlarged head end facing the imprinting location. The enlarged head includes an outwardly opening socket which includes the cavity for receiving the type holder to enable limited biased movement thereof therein.The type holder includes a base lock arrangement for securely holding type elements therein. A resilient gasket may be secured, preferably by adhesive material, to the outer rim of the type holder for cooperating with sealing means surrounding the ink saturated surface of the inking cartridge whereby to establish a sealing engagement therewith during the period while the imprinting head is at rest position. Means are provided to seat the ink cartridge within the apparatus and adjustably to lock the same therewithin and to exert a controlled adjustable force thereupon. The seal between the imprinting head and the ink cartridge also can be effected by providing a dished sealing plate or mask assembled with the ink cartridge in the imprinting apparatus. The sealing mask has a window formed therein which is surrounded by an inner rim,The mask is positioned with the inner rim seated closely proximate the exterior facing inking surface of the inksaturated pad of the cartridge. The type holder that is preferably, the gasket secured to the end of the type holder, engages the inner rim to establish the sealed engagement for the duration the imprinting head is at the rest position condition so that no evaporative loss of ink occurs. Effectively, a sealed chamber is formed wherein there is a solvent rich atmosphere about the type enabling the type to remain thereat for a considerable duration without loss due to evaporation.The inking of the typE is improved considerably as a result. The type holder is bused to enable the type holder to fly out inertially from the imprinting head when the latter is stopped in its translation to the rest condition by impacting upon the frame of the ink cartridge assembly, whe reby to impact upon the ink saturated surface of the cartridge. Where the sealing mask is employed, the sealing gasket impacts against the inner rim of the mask. The type font clements carried by the base lock means provided on the type holder extend a fraction outward of the sealing surface so that the end surfaces of the type font are coated with sufficient ink yet overloading of the type font with ink is prevented.In addition, splashing of ink upon impact is materially reduced, if not prevented altogether. Referring now to the drawings for details, the article imprinting apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention herein is designated generally by reference character 10 and is illustrated in FIGURE 1, mounted on the frame 12 of a conveyor 14 along which articles 16 travel in a direction indicated by the arrow 18 past said apparatus 10 to enable single imprinting of each with informational indicia. The apparatus 10 is illustrated mounted on the horizontally oriented arm 20 of bent rod 22, with the vertically oriented arm 24 secured to the frame 12 by clamp 26.Releasable clamp 30 effects the securement of the apparatus 10 to the arm 20 in operating condition and includes a clamping bracket 32 having a pair of generally parallel spaced arms 34 and 36, each including arcuate facing portions 38 to receive the rod arm 20 therebetween. The arms 34 and 36 are capable of being urged together by a. capped bolt 40. A captive flat wrench 42 is retained on the capped bolt 40 by a washer 40 and snap ring 40 secured inward of the capper bolt 40. The wrench 42 functions as a lever which can be utilized to release the rod arm 20 or to cl amp same at a location assuring proper location of apparatus 10 for application of an imprint upon the surface 42 of the article 16. The desired height at which the apparatus 10 is disposed can be fixed by manipulation of the relationship of the rod arm 22 and clamp 26. Rod arm 22 also can carry an actuating lever 44 extending into the path of the article 16 in position to be tripped by the passage of the leading end of the article therepast. The lever 44 is a one shot actuator as will be described hereinafter and only initiates the imprinting operation, a return switch being incorporated within the apparatus. The apparatus 10 comprises a housing 46 formed of a pair of mounting plates 48 and 50 which are arranged side by side, spaced apart and connected by transerve corner braces 52 and 54 seated in aligned apertures 56,58 formed in said plates 48 and 50 and secured thereto by screws 60. End wall 62 is secured in position between plates 48 and 50 by screws 64. Transverse brace 66 is secured between said plates 48 and 50 by screws 68 and bottom plate 70 is secured to the brace 66 by screw 72 whereby to define the housing 46. The inner surfaces 74 and 76 of plates 48 and 50 carry coextensive, aligned, matching, horizontally oriented, facing grooves 78 and 80 parallel and adjacent the upper edges 82 and 84 of said plates 48,50 and extending about two thirds of the total length of said edges. Grooves 74 and 76 open to end 86 of the respective plates 48 and 50 slidably to receive the edges of cover plate 88. A pair of matching, facing, vertically oriented grooves 90 and 92 are formed in plate surfaces 74 and 76 opening to.the uppex edges 82 and 84 of said plates 48 and 50. The inking cartridge assembly 94 is received within the housing 46 in chamber 96 defined between the grooves 90 and 92 and the end wall 62 by sliding the assembly 94 in grooves 90 and 92 until the inking cartridge assembly 94 seats on facing stop pins 98 set into said plate surfaces 74 and 76. The inking cartridge assembly 94 comprises a holding frame 100, a sponge like rectangular gasket 102 and an ink storing container 104, which is pre inked and is commercially available. Gasket 102 preferably is formed of a layer 106 formed of spongy material such as a closed cell foam rubber or the like, and a thin layer 108 formed of ink impervious rubber like sheet material a adhered to layer 106. The container 104 comprises a plastic molded, thin walled, somewhat resilient box 109 having an entrance 110 and an outer rim 112 coextensive with said entrance 110 and surrounding same, and an inner rim 1121, An ink saturated pad 114 is disposed within the interior 116 of the box 108, preferably fully occupying the interior 116 thereof.A sheet liner 118 generally is included across the top of the box to shield and seal off the entrance 110 preventing access to the interior pad ll until assembly thereof into the cartridge unit 94 is desired. The liner 118 usually is provided with a scored area, removal of which defines a window 120 to enable access to be gained to said ink saturated pad surface but leaving bordering portion between the inner rim 112 and the ink saturated pad 114. The window 120 may be of rectangular, circular or even ovalular configuration, dependin,g upon the perimetric configuration of the imprint to be applied to the surface 44 of article 16 or the overall size and or configuration of the particular surface 43 say, if the surface comprises a bottle cap or the like not shown . The gasket 102 is engaged upon the outer rim 112 of the container 104 and together, slidably are engaged within the frame 100 in the channel 122 defined by inner rim 124 and flanges 126 of said frame, as indicated by the broken line 128. The cartridge assembly 94 now is complete and ready for installation into chamber 96. Preferably, referring to FIGURE 6, a thin plate or mask 130 of generally rectangular dish shaped configuration is installed along with the cartridge assembly 94 functioning as supplementary sealing means for establishing a sealed engagement between the imprinting head of the apparatus 10 and the ink saturated pad 114 of the cartridge 94. Mask 130 carries a central recessed floor and a window 134 is formed in the recessed floor, leaving inwardly directed rim portion 132. The mask 130 is seated on the frame holder 100 with the rim portion 132 engaged on the liner portion 118 closely adjacent the ink saturated pad 114 and coextensiyely aligned with the window 120.Where the mask 130 is ued, it is fitted on the cartridge assembly 94 and both are introduced simultaneously into the chamber 96 by sliding the rim portion 132 and frame 100 into the, grooves 90 and 92. A holding structure 136 for retaining the cartridge assembly 94 in place within the chamber 96 is provided. The holding structure 136 comprises a plate member 138 of generally rectangular configuration carrying a central recess 140 and an aperture 142 formed therewithin. The plate 138 is smaller in area than the end wall 62 and is arranged parallel to the end plate 62.An elongate threaded bolt 144 is received through aperture 142. Washer 146 is placed at the free end 148 of bolt 144 and locked in place by lockwasher 150. A retaining nut 152 is seated on the bolt 144 at the opposite side of plate member 138. The bolt 144 is threadably engaged through passageway 154 and a retaining washer 156, including small diameter spacer ring 158, are engaged on said bolt 144.The head 160 of the bolt 144 mounts a knob 162 including collar 164. Roation of the knob 162 will cause the plate to be moved away from the grooves 90 and 92, widening the space between the imprinting head and the plate 88 whereby the inking cartridge assembly 94 can be installed. Once the said inking cartridge assembly 94 has been installed, the plate member 138 can be brought to bear against the container 104.The rotatable wheel 166 seated on threaded bolt 144 between the collar 164 and the plate member 138 functions to limit the extent of movement of the said plate member 138, Plate member 138 can be moyed translated by the manipulation of the knob 162 to facilitate the removal of a spent or exhausted cartridge assembly 94. and in particular, the replacement of an exhausted container 104 with a fresh replacement container. Attention now will be directed to the imprinting device, designated generally by reference character 170 which is disposed within the housing 46 for movement between a pair of angularly displaced positions, namely, a rest position, whereat a sealed engagement with the ink saturated pad of the inking cartridge assembly 94 is established and an imprinting position along an arcuate path 900 offset from the rest position. The imprinting device 170 as a unit comprises an elongate shuttle arm 172 having an enlarged head 174 with an outwardly opening cavity 176 formed therein The shuttle arm 172 is tapered at its free end 178 to terminate in a rounded cam like end 180. A pair or parallel passageways 182 are formed through the enlarged head 174 opening to the cavity 176 as shown in FIGURE 8, for example . Cap bolts 184 carry compression coil springs 186 and are seated in said passageways 182 and terminate secured in the T bar 188 which has opposite flanges 190 unitary therewith. The dimensions of the passageways 182 and the bolts 184 are selected to permit free movement of the bolts 184 in said passageways while limiting the coil springs 186 disposition between the caps 184 and the enlarged head 174. The T bar 188 normally is seated within the cavity 176 next adjacent the opening thereof. Type holder 192 is formed of a genexally xectangular hollow block 194 haying a rectangular secondary cavity 196 and flanged lug formations 198 extending outward from the surface of the block 194 opposite the cavity 196. The flanged lug formations 198 are arranged to define 900 intersecting T shaped slots 200 and 202, the intersection being at the center 204. The T bar 188 can be accommodated in either of slots 200 or 202 whereby to secure the type holder 192 to the enlarged head 174 of the shuttle 172. A base l ock type support member 206 is seated securely within the cavity 196 of the type holder 192 and carries mounted therein, type font elements 208, there being rows of suitable slots for receiving the base of the type elements. A resilient sealing gasket 210 is adhesively or otherwise secured tightly on the rim 212 of the type holder 192 coextensive with the cavity 196 thereof.The thickness of said gasket 210 is selected to be only slightly less tha n the outermost extent of the type font elements 208 when they are seated in the base lock element 206. The gasket 210 serves multiple functions, namely, to cushion the shock of impact between the imprinting head 170 and the ink saturated pad 114 or when provided, the inner rim portion 132 of mask 130. Gasket 210 also functions to cushion the shock of impact between the imprinting head 170 and the surface 44 of the article 16 when imprinting is performed at the end of the imprinting stroke, as will be explained. When the type font is to be changed or when the orientation of the message also is desired to be changed for different packa,gin,g applications,1 provision is made according to the invention, for facilitating establishment of access to the type holder 192 and is particular for removing the type holder 192 or changing Ats orientation, reassembling the type holder to the imprinting head 170. The springs 186 are compressed by manipulation of the caps 184 of bolts 184 toward the enlarged head 174.The caps 184 are urged against the bias of said springs 186 until the T bar 188 is exposed outwrad of the cavity 176.The type holder 192 can be disengaged easily from the T bar 188 by sliding the holder 192 therefrom. Replacement of the type holder with one carrying a different type font.is performed by sliding the replacement holder onto the T bar 188. If a 900 change in orientation is desired, the holder 192 is rotated and the T bar 188 is introduced onto the other intersecting slot. The upstanding lug 214 formed on the enlarged head 174 functions to provide a purchase for the operator in grasping the cap 184 of cap screw 184 and urging the cap 184 ,against the bias of springs 186.Manipulation of only one of the caps 184 is required to provide clearance sufficient to permit release of the type holder 192. Attention now is directed to the drive linkage and the guide link cooperating effectively to translate the imprinting head 170 between the angularly spaced positions discussed above. The drive linkage comprises a pair of link members 216 and 218 each having outwardly extending arms 220 and 222 respectively. Socket arms 220 and 222 carry through passageways 224 and 226. The shuttle arm 114 is provided with first and second passageways and 230 in which bushings 232 and 234 are fitted. A shaft 236 is journalled in the bushing 232. Socket arms 220 and 222 are seated on the ends of shaft 236. Links 216,218 also are provided with enlarged end portions 238,240 carrying first through passageways 242 and 244 respectively located spaced inwardly of the ends 246,248 with the axes of this latter passageway being parallel to passageways 224 and 226. Shaft 250 is mounted through said passageways 242 and 244 with the enlarged portions 238,240 in oppositely facing relationship. The enlarged end portions 238,240 also are provided with second through passageways 252,254 pos itioned parallel to first passageways 242,244 and disposed between said first passageways and ends 246,248. Shaft 256 is accommodated throu gh bushings 258,260 seated in said second passageways with the opposite ends 262,264 thereof seated in bearings 266,268 car wed by the housing plates 48,50, The Shaft 256 is maintained in fixed relationship within passageways. 252,254, in bushings 258,260 of enlarged end portions 238,240 by set screws 269. Lock washers 272 are employed tQ fix the spacing between portions 238,2 40 and center the linkage assembly and imprinting head 170 between plates 48,50. Shaft 250 is provided with a median flat portion 270 carrying transverse passage 273 through which the free end 276 of plunger 278 of cylinder 280 is passed and secured by nuts 282 and 284. There is a little play or looseness provided in the accommodation of said shafts through the respective bushings seated in the respective passageways as related so as to reduce the likelihood of binding during the operation of the apparatus 10. The drive mechanism for the apparatus 10 is designated generally by reference character 286 and includes a fluid pressure operated cylinder 280 and the plunger 28 movable between fully withdrawn and fully extended conditions within said cylinder 280, a four way valve 288 coupled between the cylinder 280 and the source of pressurized fluid not shown . The cylinder 280 is mounted fixedly to a rockable plate 290 provided with depending ears 292 and a depending flange 294. The threaded end 196 of the cylinder 280 is secured to the depending flange 294 of said plate 290. The four way valve 288 is seated interior of the housing 46 adjacent the bottom plate 70 and is secured to the transverse bottom brace 66. The valve body 298 of valve 288 is arranged generally parallel, and below, the cylinder 280. Valve 288 is coupled to a source of fluid pressure not shown by tubing 300 secured to fitting 302.The tubing 304 couples the cylinder 280 to the port 306 of the valve 288 by securement to the fitting 308 of said cylinder 280. The fitting 310 is coupled to another port 312 of valve 288. Ball switch 314 is disposed at the end of the valve body 298 opposite the fitting 302. In FIGURE 3, the ball switch 314 is illustrated in the condition assumed thereby when the imprinting head 170 has returned to its rest condition. As the plunger 278 is driven out of the cylinder 286, the drive link 216,218 is caused to pivot about the axis of shaft 250 through a part of the imprinting stroke until the imprinting head 174 is in the condition represented by the broken line representation 114 . The guide link 215,217 carries apertures 316 and 318 adjacent opposite ends thereof, the link being journalled on shaft 320 seated in passage defined by bushing 234 in passageway 230, with the shaft ends 322 and 324 seated in aperture 316 and bearings 326 seated in apertures 318,, in turn mounted to the plates 48,50. Referring to FIGURES 1 and 3, the actuating lever 44 disposed in the path of the article 16 is tripped by the leading end of said article 16. The interception of the article 16 by the actuating lever 44 operates the valve 288 to cause fluid pressure to be introduced into the cylinder 280 driving the plunger 278 outward of the cylinder 280. As the plunger 278 is forced outward of the cylinder 280, the shuttle arm 172 is pivoted about shaft 236 directing the shuttle arm 172 along a path represented by an arc 328, As the shuttle arm 172 is forced further toward the corner braces 48 and 50, the arm 172 is forced by guide links. 315,317 to assume an angular disposition, bringing end 180 upward until the axes of shafts 256,236,250 and 320 are in a straight line coincident with the center line of the shuttle 172. At this time, the end 180 of arn 172 is interceded by the resilient bumper 219 to force said end 180 upward , and cause the guide links 215,217 to force the end 180 of said shuttle 172 to pivot upward about shaft 320, bringinc enlarged head 174 of printing head 170 directed downward toward, and until, said head 174 assumes a disposition where the center line of the shuttle arm 172 is normal to the window 330 formed in the bottom plate 70.The window 330 has dimensions slightly less tha n tha t of the type holder 192 so that the imprinting head 174 will be directed, during imprinting, toward the window 330 and will impact upon said plate 70 surrounding said window 330. The type holder 192 flies out slightly after impact against the sourrounding plate and hence the type engages the surface to be imprinted. The type holder 192 is propelled out of the enlarged end a small distance as an inertial response to sudden cessation of movement. The inked type 208 carried by the type holder 192 is caused therefore, to kiss the surface .43 of the article 16 to be imprinted whereby not to damage same.The resilient gasket 20 absorbs the shock of engagement with the surface 44 and also functions to enable the orientation of type holder 192 to be self adjusted so as to compensate for minor surface irregularities of surface 44 as well as to compensate for minor height differences so long as the surface 44 to be imprinted is disposed spaced from the imprinting he a d within the range of extension of said type font 208 carried by the type holder 192, As the shaft 256 rotates, the bolt head 33 2 carried thereby, is rotated sufficiently to signal the end of the one shot imprinting cycle by impinging upon the ball switch 314 when the imprinter head 170 has delivered the imprint.Striking of the ball switch 314 by the bolt head 332 initiates a return movement of the plunger 278 and hence initiates the return stroke to bring the imprinting head 170, and particularly the type holder 192, back to its sealed relationship with cartridge assembly 94. The clamp 30 is assembled to the apparatus 10 by securement to a circular disc 334 seated on one of the mounting plates 48,50 of housing 46 depending on the side of the conveyor th.e apparatus is desired to be stationed The disc. 334 is held to the plates 48 or 50 by syininetrically positioned screws 336 carrying slotted washers 338 so that there is a three point coupling. The loosening of said screws 338 enable the apparatus 10 to be rotated to any angular orientation desired, whereupon the screws 33 are tightened, The disc 334 may be removed from the plate 48 and reassembled on the opposite plate. 50 if desired. As viewed in FIGURE 1 it is evident that the imprinting apparatus is adjustable for height. and overhang can be installed on either side of the conveyor within appreciable downtime, and can be rotated through any angular disposition relative to the conveyor. The apparatus is versatile, more durable than prior imprinting devices of the intermittent impact type, enables longer useful life for the inking cartridges in view of the improved sealing effect obtained and, as well, includes an improved means for controlling the normal stroke of the imprinting head 170 with added selective hyper extension to gain access to the type holder 192 for removal and or replacement thereof, as well as to change its orientation without the use of tools. In lieu of the resilient bumper illustrated and described herein, a corner brace alone can be sUbstituted to intercept the shuttle to force the same to move in the desired path for reaching the desired orientation at the imprinting position. Further, a spring finger mounted at the brace or upon. the end of the shuttle can suffice to guide the movement of the imprinting head and prevent folding of the linkages causing misalignment of the imprinting head or other interference with the desired shuttle path during the imprinting and or return strokes. The actuating .lever 44 may be replaced by electronically operated sensing means, for example, such as a proximity detector,a photocell, etc. which is activated by the presence of an article at or coming to the imprinting location. The path taken by the imprinting head of apparatus 10 is controlled by o pair of linkages secured to the imprinting head, including the direct driven link pair and the follower or idler linkage pair. The imprinting head at its eat or loading condition is oriented at a ninety degree angle relative horizontal. The head is driven through a path toward an offset printing location angulary rotating throught 90 in the course of its simultaneous movement to its imprinting location.The idler link provided by the referenced structure follows a path whereby the an.gular raLe of rotation decreases until the mid point of the path is reached and then increases until the. terminus of its printing stroke is reached, The type holder is spring biased so that it is inetially driven outward of the head on the sudden cessation, of movement of the imprinting head at the imprinting terminus of said path, Occasionaly, the movement of the impriit,ing head through the imprinting stroke angularly is misdirected so that the orientation of the type holder may be misoriented at the impact location. The head also may be held up at the mid point of travel, misoriented, inverted, or simply stuck thereat as the rate of travel and the angular rotation,, i.e., the slip is at its least.Aresilient bumper is suggested in the referenced application to aid in guiding the rotating imprinting head in following the proper path, Atention now will be directed to a modified embodiment of the iivention illustrated in Figures 9 to 12 and designated generally by reference character 10 . The same reference characters are used in figures 9 to 13 to denote common structural elements. The imprinting head 150 includes a type holder designated generally at 170 is formed of a generally rectangular hollow block 172 having a rectangular secondary cavity 174 , A base lock type segments 176 are seated within the cavity 174 of the type holder 170 and carries mounted therein, type front elements 178 .Aresilient sealing gasket 180 is adhesively or oherwise secured tightly on the rim 182 of the type holder 170 coextensive with the cavity 174 thereof, The thickness of sid gqket flat is selected to be only slightly less than the outermost extent of the type font elements 178 when. they are seated, The gasket 1 serves multiple functions, namely, to cushion the shock of impact between the imprinting head 170 and the liner 108 bordering the ink saturated pad 114 ,Gasket 180 also functions to cushion the shock of impact between the imprintin.g head 170 and the surface 43 of the article 16 when imprinting is performed at the end of the imprinting stroke and limits the impact of the type fart per se, resulting in a clear imprint. When the type front is to be changed or when the orientation of the message also is desired to be changed for different packaging applications, provision is made for facilitating access to the type holder 170 , and is particular for removing the type holder 170 or changing its orientation, reassembling the type holder 170 to tie imprinting head l5Q , The springs 166 are compressed by manipulation of the caps of bolts 164 toward the enlarged head 162 .The caps are urged against the bias of said springs 166 until the holder 170 is forced outward of the cavity 174 sufficiently to be disengaged from the imprinting head, Atention now is directed to the drive linkage and the cam and follower means of aparatus 10 cooperating effectively to translate the imprinting head 15Q between the angular spaced positis with constant angular acceleration to a maximum at midpath and deceleration, also constant to a terminal condition at the end of the imprinting stroke, the inertial extension thereafter effecting the printing impression, The drive linkage comprises a pair of link. members 190 and 192 each haying shallow arms 1941, Arms 194 carry through passageways 196 . Links 190 , 192 jormalled on shaft 198 mounted in passageway 196 and throug a bore taken through imprinting head 150 . The head 150 has a pair of extensions 200 and passageways 202 are formed therein. Shaft 204 is journalled in said passageway, 202 and roller bearings bushings 204 are seated securely at the opposite ends of the shaft 204 . A cam slot 210 is formed in each plate 48 and 50 The cam slots z are identical, coextensive and aligned along their length when the plates 48,50 are assembled to form the side parts of the housing 46.The cam roller bushings 2061 are seated within the cam slots 210 . The cam slots z are formed so that they guide the bushings 206 during the imprinting and return strokes, and hence the imprinting head 150 through a rotation of 90 with minimum possible contact on the cam face and with the load divided equally across its entire face. The width of the slots flat increases slightly at the corners 21T , that is approximate the midpath of travel, over a generally constant width over the remaining portions to avoid possible binding due to manufacturing variations in the dimensions of the pertinent elements. .e path of the cam Slot is developed so as to effect a constant angular acceleration of the imprinting head during the imprinting stroke from the load condition to the midpath, engaged with the cartridge and q constant deceleration from the midpath to the terminus of the imprinting stroke.At the load conditions, the imprinting head is arranged with the face of the type holder in a vertically oriented plan.e, At the terminus of the imprintig stroke, the type face is in a horizontally oriented condition, The minimization of the rate of rotation of the imprinting head near the ends of the stroke effestively prevents shaking and or misalignment at the ends of the stroke. In the course of its travel, the imprinting head is rotated 9Q , the angle defined between the center line of link 190 an.d the center line of the imprinting head, that is the pivot axis of said head, is between 90. and 180 . From a to 90, the change of the latter angle is 1 for each degree of rotation of the link, the angular rotation isconstant and the initial acceleration, zero From 9 to and through 45 , motion of the desire is to obtain a, .gentle constant angular acceleration of the head with least minimization of thrust on the cam surface.The link moves through 45 rotation to the midpath midpoint of the cam siotL little the angular rotation of the head is directed through 90 relative to the link. The same path for deceleraLion is followed through remaining 36 of movement of the link to the final is of the travel during which the imprinting head again assumes a parallelogrammic motion. The parallelogrammic motion, insurens that the plane of the type face will be parallel to the impact surfaces during its final approach thereto In the apparatus 10 imprinting head 150 is urged through its path during the imprinting stroke so that its least angular rate of rotation occurs at midpath to avoid undesired fold over at the midpath.With apparatus 10, the possility of fold over is elimin.atedt the least rate of rotation occurring at the en.d of the strokes imprinting an,d return, Tke path defin.ed by the cam slot 2.10 is extended at its theoretical ends to provide for an additional angular movement of the link 5 at. the opposite ends of the imprinting stroke and return stroke to insure that the cam roller will not srik.e the ends of the path. This also enables adjustment of the length of the stroke 3 32nds as will be expleined hereinafter.The angular rotational acceleration of the imprinting head increases to a peak at the midpoint and then decelerations occurs throuhg the remaining 36 until the 81 to 90 generally straight section is reached. Links 190 , 192 hava enlarged and portions 214 thruogh which there are pivot assemblies 216 and 218 with the axisis of assambly 216 being genarally parallel to passageways 194 . Schaft 220 is mounted in pivot assembly 216 . The second pivot assembly 218 is positioned parallel to first pivot assembly 216 . Pivot assemblies 216 , 218 include bearings carryed by the housing plates 48,50. The shaft 216 is maintained in fixed relationship relative the pivot assemblies, Means are provided to fix the spacing between enlarged end positions 214 and to center the linkage assembly and imprinting head 150 between said plates 48,50. Shaft 250 is coupled pivotally to pluger 222 of cylinder 224 and is secured by nut 226 . There is a little play or looseness provided in the accommodation of said shafts through the respective bushings seated in the respective passageways as related so as to reduce the likelihood of binding during operation. The drive mechanism for the apparatus 10 is designated generally by reference character 230 and includes a fluid pressure operated cylinder 2 S s and the plunger 222. movable between fully withdrawn and fully extended conditions within said cylinder 232 , a four way valve 234 coupled between the cylinder 232 an.d the source of pressurized fluid not shown . The cylinder 232 is moulted fixedly to a rockable plate 236 provided with ears 236 and a depending flange 240 .. The threaded end Z42 of the cylinder 232 is secure.d to the depending flange 240 of said plate 236 . TRe four way valve 234 is seated in.terior of the housing 46 adjacent the bottom plate and is secured to the transverse bottom brace 66. The valve body 244 of valve 234 is arranged generally parallel and below, the cylinder 232 . Valve 234 is coupled to a source of fluid pressure not shown by tubing 246 secured to fitting 248 . The tubing 250 couples the cylinder 232 to one port 252 of the valve 234 by securement to the fitting 254 of said cylinder 232 . The fitting 254 is coupled to another portion of valve 234 q Ball switch 256 is disposed at an end of the valve 234 opposite the fitting 248 . In FIGURE 12, the ball switch 256 is illustrated in the condition assumed when the imprinting head 150 is at the teminus of its imprinting stroke, As the plunger 222 is driven out of the cylinder 232 , the drive links 216 ,218 in broken line is caused to pivot about the axis of shaft 250 through a part of the imprinting stroke until the imprinting head 15Q is in the condition represen.ted by the full representation, Referring to FIGURES 9 and 11, the actuating level 44 disposed in the path of the article 16 is tripped by the leading end of said article 16. The in.terception of tile article 16 b.y the actuating lever 44 operates the valve 2 to cause fluid pressure to be introduced into the cylinder 2 32 driving the plunger 222 outward of the cylinder 232 .As the plunger 222 is forced outward of the cylinder 2 32 , the imprinting head 150 is pivoted about shaft 198 directing the head 150 along a path represented by an arc. As the bearings 206 carried by the shaft 204 are driven further along the cam slot 210 toward the midpath point of the imprinting stroke, the imprinting head reaches its maximun angular speed of rotation and trips around the corner 212 directing the orientation of type holder 170 to approach a horizontal plane parallel to the surface of the package to be imprinted. After passing the midpath of the imprinting stroke guided by the cam slot 210 , the head 1501 decelerates angularly until stopped at the end of the said stroke.The type holder 170 is extended inertially to imprint the package surface. She window 255 in bottom plate 1 has dimensions slightly larger than that of the type holder 17 so that the imprinting head will be directed, ring imprinting, through the window 255 and will impact upon said surface 43. he parallelogrammic motion of the type holder 17 in the last portion of the imprinting stroke enables the inked type 178 carried by the type holder 170 effectively to kiss the surface 43 of the article 16 whereby not to damage same or to mis it same orientationally.The resilient gasket 180 on the type holder 170 absorbs the shock of engagement with the surface 43 and also functions to further enable the orientation of the type holder 17 to be self adjusted so as to compensate for minor surface irregularities as well as to compensate for very minor height differences so long as the surface to be imprirted is disposed spaced from the imprinting head within the range of extension of said type font 178 carried by the type holder The window 255 in bottom plate 7Q has dimensions slightly larger than that of the type holder 170 so that the imprinting head will be directed, during imprinting, through the window 255 and will impact upon said surface 43.The parallelogrammic motion of the type holder 170 in the last portion of the imprinting stroke enables the inked type 178 carried by the type holder 170 effectively to kiss the surface 43 of the article 16 whereby not to damage same or to mishit same orientationally. The resilient gasket 180 on the type holder 170 absorbs the shock of engagement with the surface 43 and also functions to further enable the orientation of the type holder 170 to be self adjusted so as to compensate for minor surface irregularities as well as to compensate for very minor height differences so long as the surface to be imprinted is disposed spaced from the imprinting head witnin the range of extension of said type font 178 carried by the type holder 170 , inertially or when extended adjustably as will be explained later. As the shaft 256 rotates, the bolt 257 carried thereby rotates sufficiently to signal the end of the one shot imprinting cycle by impinging upon the ball switch 259 when the imprinting head 150 has delivered the imprinting via type holder 170 and type font 178 . Striking of the ball switch 259 initiates a return movement of the plunger 222 and hence initiates the return stroke to bring the imprinting head 150 , and particularly, the type holder 170 , back to its sealed relationship with the cartridge assembly 94. The exposure of the pad 114 is minimal. As viewed in FIGURE 9 it is evident that the imprinting apparatus 10 a so can be installed at a predetermined location relative to the conveyor and is adjustable for height and overhang, can be installed on either side of the conveyor within appreciable downtime, and can be rotated through any angular disposition relative to the conveyor. The invention herein provides for a vernier type adjustment of the imprinting location by varying the terminal location of the imprinting stroke. This is accomplished pivotally by mounting the rocker plate 236 on an excentric axis 258 . The vertically offset point of the said excentric mounting axis is variable to vary the terminus location a predetermined linear distance, here 3 32nds of an inch. The adjustability compensates for variance in the normally encountered height once the imprinting apparatus has been mounted set up without disassembly. The variance of height of a series of packages being processed require compensation which can be adjusted manually by the operator without requiring such adjustment to be made in the mounting per se. A plate 260 carries the excentrically centered shaft which constitutes said axis 258 . Plate 260 carries pin 262 which is secured to adjustment knob 264 . Through arcuate slot 268 the pin 262 is guided for movement in arcuate slot 266 formed in plate 48 along an angular path. See arrow FIG. 11 . Movement of the pin 2621 in slot 266 causes the plate 236 to be shifted horizontally thus the extent of the imprinting and return stroke terminal with the said linear horizontal movement of said plate 236 .The apparatus is versatile, more durable than prior imprinting devices of the intermittent impact type, enables longer useful life for the inking cartridges in view of the improved sealing effect obtained. Selective hyper extension of the type holder can be provided for gaining access to the type holder 170 for removal and or replacement thereof, as well as to change its orientation without the use of tools. The invention is not limited to the use only of fluid operated systems such as described above. Electrically operated devices such as solenoids can be employed to drive the plunger or the linkages to move the imprinting head between its rest and imprinting positions. No means to intercept the imprinting head during either imprinting or return stroke need be provided. The desired path defined by the cam slot is sufficient to enable the desired orientation of the type holder to be reached at the imprinting location and at the terminus of the return stroke. No precautions need be taken to prevent misfolding of any linkages causing misalignment of the imprinting head or other interference with the desired path of said head during the imprinting and or return strokes. The actuating lever 44 may be replaced by electronically operated sensing means, for example, such as proximity detector, a photocell, etc. which is activated by the presence of an article at or coming to the imprinting location. It should be pointed out that although not shown in Figure 2, reference is to be made to Figure 4 herein there is illustrated the thin plate or mask 270 6f generally recetangular dish shaped configuration installed along with the cartridge assembly 94 functioning as supplementary sealing means for establishing a sealed engagement between the imprinting head and the ink saturated pad 114 of the cartridge 94.
