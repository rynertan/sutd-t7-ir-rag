# PPE compositions comprising an ethylene polymer containing carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.

## Abstract
Blends of polyphenylene ether resin and a small amount of certain ethylene copolymers or terpolymers con taining hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups, optionally including impact modifier can be molded into articles which possess improved Gardner impact strength. The improve ment is considerably greater than that which is achieved by use of the same amount of low density polyethylene.
