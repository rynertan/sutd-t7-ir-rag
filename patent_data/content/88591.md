# ON BOARD MEMORY FOR MULTI COMPONENT MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS

## Abstract
In the modern world of electronic design the equipment is becoming smaller and smaller and the manufacture and pro duction departments are finding it more and more difficult to fix control labels, serial numbers, fault labels, progress data etc. to the product during its manufacturing process. The proposal is that each product printed circuit card in the specific ap plication to Telephone Exchange production carries a pro grammable read only memory dedicated to the storage of the manufacture production information only. Such a device requi res only one i.c. of the order of 1 1 2 1 2 and some access pins on the pcb connector. The incorporation of such a device allows it to be used to condition automatic component assembly equipment and automatic testing equipment for example. In addition the memory can be used to store working data such as routine maintentance information or replaced faulty component information. The equipment for reading and writing to the product s memory is not resident on the product but would be available when the memory requires to be read or modified. The basic concept is applicable to a wide range of complex products which require the assembly of a large number of component parts.
