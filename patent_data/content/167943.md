The present invention extends to each of these forms and to mixtures thereof.It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formulae I or II may have chiral centres, and thus be capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms including enantiomers and to mixtures thereof including racemates . An example of a chiral centre is the carbon atom of the moiety CHR2 when R2 is other than hydrogen.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formulae I and II include pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic salts such as sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, borate, hydrochloride and hydrobromide, and pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid additions salts such as acetate, fumarate, tartrate, citrate, lactate, salicylate, maleate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, methanesulphonate, mandelate, ketoglutarate, a glycerophosphate, and the acid addition salt is the hydrochloride salt.Examples of quaternised derivatives include compounds of the formula I and II quaternised by R18QI where R18 is G1 4 alkyl, C3 6 cycloalkyl, C3 6 cycloalkyl, C14 alkyl or phenyl C14 alkyl and Q is halide such as chloride, bromide or iodide.A particular compound of the formulae I or II or its acid addition salt can form salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals, usually sodium and potassium, and ammonium and substituted ammonium salts.Compounds of formula I or II and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or quaternised derivatives may form solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents and the invention extends to such solvates.Crystalline compounds and salts are favoured.The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a quaternised derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III or an acid addition salt thereof R3 Rll III wherein R3 is as hereinbefore defined in relation to formula I , with a compound of formula IV EMI7.1 wherein R1 and Y are as hereinbefore defined in relation to formula I and a R11 is a group displaceable by a nucleophile and R12 is CH3SO b R11 is CHR2Q1 where R2 is as hereinbefore defined and Q1 is a group displaceable by a nucleophile and R12 is HS or c R11 is CHR2SH where R2 is as hereinbofore defined and R12 is a group displaceable by a nucleophile thereafter if desired carrying out one or more of the following steps i oxidising a compound of formula I wherein n is zero to a compound of formula I wherein n is one ii converting any variable group to another corresponding variable R group and iii salifying or quaternising the resulting compound of the formula I .Suitable examples of R11 in variant a above include halide such as C1 or Br.Suitable examples of Q1 and R12 in process variants b and c respectively include halide such as C1, Br or I, and labile acyloxy such as OS02CH3 or OS02p C6H4CH3 mesyloxy and tosyloxy .Reaction in all variants is generally effected at a non extreme temperature, such as a moderately elevated temperature for example solvent reflux temperature, such as 50 to 1500C, for example 75 to 100 C, in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. The acceptor is suitably an inorganic acid acceptor, such as a strong base for example sodium hydride, butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide a moderately strong base, for example sodium hydroxide or a moderate base for example calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. In some cases the moderate base acid acceptor is favourably an organic base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline.The most suitable acceptor depends on the particular variant.Thus for example, for variant a a strong base is appropriate. For variant b or c a moderately strong base or moderate base is appropriate.The inert solvent can be any solvent inert to both reactants and appropriate to the leaving group, the acid acceptor and desired reaction remperature.Suitable solvents include lower alkanols such as ethanol, dioxan, dimethylformamide DMF toluene, diethyl ether,or methylene chloride. For process variant b in particular suitable solvents include polar solvents such as DMF or ethanol. Where reaction is effected in the presence of a base which is insoluble in the polar solvent, water may be added to the solvent. Reaction is generally effected at moderately elevated temperatures as mentioned hereinbefore, such as reaction mixture reflux temperature or at about 100 C, if lower.It will be appreciated that when the compound of formula III or IV contains an unsubstituted amino group, such a group will generally be protected, during at least the main reaction of the invention by a conventional N protecting group for examples an acyl group such as acetyl or phthalyl. Protection may be effected by reaction with an acylating agent such as the relevant acyl chloride or anhydride. Deprotection may be effected for example by base hydrolysis of an acetyl protecting group or treatment of a phthalimide protecting group with hydrazine hydrate in a lower alkanol.Process variants b and c produce compounds of formula I wherein n is 0. If a compound of formula I is desired wherein n is, it is necessary to oxidise the compound resulting from the process.Subsequent oxidation may be carried out at below ambient temperatures in a non aqueous solvent, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, in the presence of an organic peracid, such as 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, or in water in the presence of a soluble strong inorganic oxidant, such as aqueous hydrogen peroxide. It will be realised that this process may also N oxidise any tertiary amine moiety and suitable precautions will routinely be taken by the skilled man, if it is desired to avoid this.The conversions in step iii above are carried out by conventional methods.Examples of such conversions include the conversion ofY group substitutent to another. In particular a hydrogen is convertible to a nitro substitutent by nitration b a nitro substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by reduction c an acylamino substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by deacylation d an amino substituent is convertible to acylamino substituent by acylation e hydrogen is convertible to a halo substituent by halogenation f a fluoro or chloro substituent is convertible to an optionally substituted amino substituent by reaction with suitable amine or ammonia g an amino substituent is convertible to a halo, cyano, or hydrogen substituent by diazotisation and simultaneous nitrogen elimination with halogenation, cyanation, or reduction h an amino substituent is convertible to an alkylated amino substituent by alkylation or reductive alkylation and i a carboxy substituent is convertible to a C16 alkoxycarbonyl substituent by esterification.In regard to a , nitration is carried out in accordance with known procedures.In regard to b , the reduction is carried out using methods conventional for reducing nitro groups on aromatic nuclei, for example using Raney nickel, stannous chloride or iron powder in glacial acetic acid or hydrochloric acid.In regard to c , deacylation is carried out by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide.In regard to d , the acylation is carried out with an acylating agent, such as the corresponding acid anhydride or acid chloride. Formylation is carried out with formic acid.In regard to e , halogention is carried out with conventional halogenating agents, under conventional reaction conditions for the halogenation of aromatic nuclei, that is with the relevant halogen in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as ferric chloride, zinc chloride or boron trifluoride, in an inert organic sovlent such as chloroform or dichloromethane, at temperatures below ambient.Alternatively a polar solvent, such as glacial acetic acid without a catalyst may be used.In regard to f , the amination is carried out under conventional conditions using an inert solvent such as ethanol or an excess of amine also functioning as the solvent. g may be effected by reacting an alkali metal nitrite, a strong inorganic acid and the reaction product in aqueous solution at 10 to lO0C. Subsequent simultaneous nitrogen elimination and halogenation, cyanation or reduction may be effected by treating the diaeotisation product with a halide, cyanide or hydride source, under either Sandmeyer orSchiemann reaction conditions for halide and nitrile, or by treatment with hypophosphorous acid for hydride respectively. h and i may be effected entirely conventionally. For R3 j H may be converted to acyl by conventional acylation.k any of the acyl groups listed hereinbefore for R11 may be converted to hydrogen by conventional deacylation.1 carboxy may be converted to C1 6 alkoxycarbonyl by conventional esterification.In regard to j O acylation is carried out under conventional conditions with an acylating agent which has an acyl group capable of forming an hydrolysable acyloxy group and a leaving group, such as halide, for example chloride and bromide, and hydrogen. When halide is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base. When hydroxy is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, at a non extreme temperature, such as ambient temperature. In regard to k , deacylation is carried out by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide.In regard to 1 esterification is entirely conventional.Conversions a to 1 are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities.In general, interconversion of R7,Rg,Rg and R10 to other R7,Rg,Rg and Rl0 will not be readily effected.However, such interconversions as are possible, and suitable methods and conditions for effecting them, will be readily apparent to the skilled man.The choice or necessity of variable interconversion will be dictated by the nature and position of the variable, as will the choice of intermediate or compound in which interconversion is effected.In all the foregoing interconversions, the effect, if any, on other substituents should be considered, and such reagents as are appropriate should be selected together with the adoption of such routine precautionary measures as are necessary.It is however preferred that any conversions are carried out at the earliest stage possible in the synthesis.The invention also provides a process, for the preparation of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or quaternary derivative thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof whereinEMI14.1 R1, R2,Y and n are as defined in relation to formula I and R3 is a pyridyl group substituted by at least one hydroxy or Cl 4alkoxy groups and u i o Chree further substituents independently selected from halogen, C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy, C1 6 alkylthio, C1 6alkoxy C1 6 alkoxy, carboxy esterfied carboxy, or amino optionally ii substituted by one or two groups independently selected from C1 6 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C14 alkyl or optionally N.N disubstituted byC4 5 polymethylene or C34 polymethylenecarbonyl, or one of said further substituents is joined to R2 to form a carbocylic ring of up to 7 ring atoms with a compound of formula R13Q2 wherein R13 is R4 as hereinbefore defined or when R3 is substituted by hydroxy, R13 can be CH2 mOR4 and Q2 is a leaving group in which m is as hereinbefore defined and thereafter if necessary, carryiny out one or more of the following steps i oxidising a compound of formula I wherein n is zero to a compound of formula I whereiti n is one ii converting any variable R group to another corresponding variable R group and iii salifying or quaternising the resulting compound of the formula I .Suitable examples of Q2 include halide such as Chloro or bromo.Process conditions may be conventional conditions for the alkylation of an aromatic hydroxy substituent.The interconversion of variables groups may be effected as described hereinbefore.In the above described processes, compounds of the formula I may be salified in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with a chosen acid to form acid addition salts.The quaternary derivatives of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner,such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R18Q as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol or ethanol.Salts of compounds of the formula I containing a carboxy groups may be formed conventionally by reacting a compound of the formula I with a corresponding base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or an optionally substituted ammonium hydroxide. The preparation of intermediates for the preparative process of the invention may be effected by building up the intermediates in any given process or process variant by processes analogous to those in other relevant variants of the first process of the invention or by conventional oxidation as described hereinbefore for a compound of the formula I , or such intermediates are known compounds or are preparable analogously to or routinely derivable from known compounds.The intermediates of formula III in all the variants of the first process are known compounds, or are preparable analogously to, or are routinely derivable from known compounds. For example the intermediates of formula III in variant a of the first process of the invention, i.e.wherein R10 is a group displaceable by a nucleophile, in particular chloro or bromo, may be prepared by halogenation of the corresponding 2 pyridone. Suitable halogenating agents include phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus oxybromide, thionyl chloride, and phosphorus pentachloride used under conventional conditions for each given reagent. It is believed that the intermediates of formula IV in all the variants of the first process are known compounds or are preparable analogously to, or are routinely derivable from known compounds. However, by way of example the preparation of various intermediates of formula IV are described hereinafter In variant a of the first process, the intermediates of formula IV , i.e. wherein R11 is CH3SO may be prepared by oxidising in the manner described hereinbefore for a compound of formula I , a corresponding compound wherein the CH3SO group is replaced by CH3S. This compound may be prepared by conventional S alkylation of a compound of formula V wherein Rll is SH, i.e. the intermediate of process variant b .In process variant b , the intermediate of formula IV , i.e. wherein R11 is HS may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V wherein Rll is a group displaceable by a nucleophile with thiourea followed by base hydrolysis of the thiuronium salt.The intermediates of formula V are belIeved to be novel and as such form an aspect of the present invention.They are preparable by a process analogous to the first process of this invention. The skilled man will appreciate that in such a process it is desirable to protect any R7 hydroxy group to prevent electrophilic attack on the group oxygen atom. Protection may be achieved for example using a C16 alkyl group, which may be conventionally converted to hydrogen subsequent to the main reaction, for example using warm hydrobromic acid or iodotrimethylsilane.The compounds of formulae I and II , pharmaeutically acceptable salts and quaternised derivates thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of any of the foregoing may be used in the treatment of disorders caused or exacerbated by excess gastric acid secretion such as peptic ulcer and Zollinger Ellison syndrome.

The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers.Such operations are of course conventional in the art.The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel,hydrogenated edible fats emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suepended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a sufactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.When appropriate the compositions of this invention may be presented as an aerosol for oral administration, as a microfine powder for insufflation, or as a suppository for rectal or vaginal administration. Suitable unit dose forms include tablets, capsules and powders in sachets or vials, and preferred forms include shaped oral unit doses, such as tablets and capsules.The compositions may contain from 0.1 to 99 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the active meterial, depending on the method of administration.The invention also provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of disorders, such as peptic ulcers, in mammals including humans, caused or exacerbated by excess gastric acid secretion, which comprises the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or quaternised derivative thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of any of the foregoing, to the sufferer. An amount effective to treat the disorders hereinbefore described depends on the relative efficacies of the compounds of the invention, the nature and severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the mammal. However, a unit dose will normally contain 1 to 2000 for example 5 to 1000 mg of the compound of the invention. Unit doses will normally be administered at least once a day, for example 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 times a day such that the total daily dose is normally in the range 0.1 to 30 mg kg per day, i.e. 7 to 2000 mg day for a 70kg human adult.As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.The invention also provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a quaternised derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof for use in therapy, in particular for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders caused or exacerbated by excess gastric acid secretion.The following Examples illustrate the preparation of active compounds of the formula I .

stomach preparationThe modified 1 perfused stomach preparation 2 of the urethane 25 solution anaesthetised rat, maintained at 370C, allows the continuous measurement of pH during basal and stimulated acid secretion.The lumen of the stomach of male Wistar rats approximately 200 g bodyweight was perfused, via a cannula designed to reduce the dead space of the stomach, with 5 glucose solution 370C at the rate of 3 ml min. The perfusate was forced over the surface of the secretory mucosa only, the antrum being excluded.The effluent then passed over a microflow type glass pH electrode via collecting funnel situated in the non glandular forestomach. The secretagogue histamine was administered as a constant intravenous infusion to produce a steady rate of acid secretion. Test compounds were administered in solution as bolus intravenous injections and any effect on the pH of the perfusate noted. me perfusate pH was recorded on a potentiometric recorder and anti secretory responses were measured in terms of the maximal reduction in hydrogen ion concentration expressed as a percentage of the control concentrations.
