# Hinged steam generator nozzle plug.

## Abstract
A nozzle plug 22 for blocking a nozzle 46 in a nuclear steam generator 16 is improved by the addition of hinges 40a, 40b which allow the nozzle plug 22 to be inserted into the steam generator 16 through an access port 52 of sub stantially smaller diameter than the nozzle 46 . A recess 54 is provided in one of the semi circular plates 28 allowing the plates to nest, further reducing the necessary size of the access port 46 .
