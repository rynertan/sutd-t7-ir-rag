# Method of processing picture data for printing process and device implementing the same.

## Abstract
This system relates to a technology for inputting picture data from a manuscript using a layout scanner. When in putting picture data from the manuscript, a layout sheet is set on position data input means such as a data tablet to obtain a specified point on the layout sheet and position data includ ing a trimming range. The position data is delivered to a dis play together with the picture data. Displaying the picture data and the position data with they being superimposed with each other, the position data is visually confirmed and a necessary correction is made. Another method is to record position data into a recording medium e.g. floppy disk etc. to allow a layout scanner to output the picture data by applying exposure process thereto on the basis of the recording con tents of the recording medium.
