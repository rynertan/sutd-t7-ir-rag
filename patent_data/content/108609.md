# Method and apparatus for the phonetic recognition of words.

## Abstract
The method consists in analysing phonemes of the phonetic signal at regular intervals of time, comparing the phonemes with a series of reference phonemes, selecting the reference phoneme closest to the phoneme of the phonetic signal and generating a visible indication of the selected phoneme in real time on a monitor 20 to allow the speaker to adapt his speech to the response of the apparatus. The apparatus comprises a series of analysers A₁, A₂ ....A A control unit 19 receiving the result of the comparison controls the visual display on the monitor 20 of a histogram indicating the selected phoneme and also a merit value P and a stability value ST , of the recognition. A lexical recognition unit 22 is adapted to link indi vidual phonemes together to recognise words and to display the words on the monitor 20 .
