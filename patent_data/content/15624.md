# Device for phase compensation and excitation of an asynchronous machine operating as a generator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for phase compen sation and excitation of a multiphase asynchronous ma chine, especially one to be driven as a generator and to be operated at low speed. Each winding 1 to 3 in the ma chine is connected in series or in parallel with a capacitive element consisting of a bank of capacitors 4 to 6 having at least one pair of series connected electrolytic capacitors 7, 8 , having in each pair equal terminals interconnected.
