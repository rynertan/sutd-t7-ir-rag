# A process for controlling the growth of a crystal.

## Abstract
In a process for growing a boule of a crystal from a liquid melt, the temperature gradient profile of the meniscus and the phase change interface is detected by projecting an image of the meniscus through a lens onto a charge coupled device CCD detector array and the information provided by scanning the CCD is used to control the boule pull rate, the crucible and boule rotation rate, and the liquid melt tempera ture.

## Description
A PROCESS FOR CCNTROLLING mE GROWTH OF A CRYSTALThis invention relates to a process for controlling the growth of a crystal. U.S A 4,242,589, 4,277,441 and 4,318,769 are all concerned with monitoring crystal growth. These prior documents disclose processes which employ a camera for forming and converting the image of the meniscus into an electric signal representing the image. Repetitive scanning is used but the location of the phase change is not used to control the process. When a boule of a crystal is grown from a liquid melt in a controlled process, a meniscus of the material undergoing phase change is formed between the boule and the liquid melt. A process according to the present invention involves the steps of 1 projecting an image of the meniscus through a lens onto a charge coupled device detector array CCD 2 electrically scanning the output of the CCD signal to ascertain the temperature gradient profile of the meniscus and the phase change interface and 3 controlling the boule pull rate, the crucible and boule rotation rate, and the liquid melt temperature on the basis of the temperature profile of the meniscus and the phase change interface. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a schematic representation of a process embodying the invention. A material, for example silicon, is melted in a crucible. Typically this takes place in a Czochralski type crystal growing apparatus. As the boule is formed, a meniscus is formed between the boule and the melt.An image of this meniscus is projected through a lens onto a charge coupled device detector array CCD . By observing the output signal level which depends upon the emissivity of the object, the location of the boule melt interface can be easily identified. A discrete filter may be placed between the sensor and the view port in order to avoid misleading information and incorrect identification, but such a filter is not essential. The output information of the CCD is then used to control the boule pull rate, the crucible and the boule rotation rate and the liquid melt temperature. The image of the meniscus projected through the lens on the CCD can be either an emission image or a reflection image. The present invention is not limited to any particular type of crystal growing apparatus. The invention is very suitable for use with a Czochralski type apparatus, which is very well known in the art. The present invention is applicable to crystal growing processes for any material. It is, however, of particular economic interest and importance in the manufacture of crystals of silicon. By means of the present invention, it is possible to automate the entire process. This represents a great step forward over the prior art. Classic optical techniques cannot be implemented becuase of the geometric constraint imposed by the crystal growing apparatus. Even with good reflectivity of the hot melt surfaces, light projected through the viewing port is not returned to any monitoring device because of unfavourable angles. A pyrometer, utilizing the self luminous properties of the hot interface, measures totally radiated energy into the viewing solid angle. This is an absolute measurement which cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy to effectively control the process.The process of the present invention, however, solves these problems. When used to form silicon crystals, the process of the present invention takes place at a very high temperature, e.g. around 1690 K, and in an inert atmosphere to prevent oxidation. When the phase of certain elements changes from liquid to solid, their optical properties show a drastic change. As silicon or other semiconductor material melts, its reflectivity increases and its absorptivity decreases. The emissivity is higher when the silicon is in solid phase. At the boule ii,elt interface, the temperature gradient from liquid to solid is around 2 30K therefore, in this binary phase system we observe over a very small area, a significant variation in thermal radiation level. By determining specific zones of the boundary area and with careful calibration, one can control the crystal growing process.
