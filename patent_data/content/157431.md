## Description
PROCEDURE TO MEASURE THE DIMENSIONS OF A BODY IN MOVEMENT INA THREE DIMENSIONAL FIELD, AND AN OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICE TO CARRY OUT SUCH PROCEDURE This invention concerns a procedure to measure the dimen sions of a body in movement in a three dimensional field. To be more exact, the invention concerns a procedure suitable to measure a dimension, such as a diameter, of a body in movement in a three dimensional field without contacting such body. This may be necessary when measuring the diameters or thicknesses of rolled sections during hot rolling or of other objects of which the measurement by contact is difficult if not impossible. The invention also concerns a device to carry out the abo ve procedure. As we said above, the invention is applicable in particul ar to the measurement, without contact, of the dimensions of sections of rolled sections or bars during hot rolling or drawn ing operations and in general in all cases where it is desired.to measure a diameter or a thickness of a body in movement or, of course, a still body in a delimited space provided that the axis of the body in its movement is kept substantially parallel to a given direction at a right angle to the diameter or thick ness which it is desired to measure. According to the known art, when it is not possible to em .ploy contact devices such as gauges or micrometers, the measu rement of the diameter or thickness of a body can be performed by means of optical devices. For instance, devices for the measurement of diameters are known which employ the mechanical modulation of a laser .beam. The latter forms a luminous pencil which is moved along .the body to be measured by means of mechanical means such as rotary mirrors, deflectors, etc. The reading is performed, for instance, on the time of .the obscuring of a sensor, the speed of displacement of the lu minous beam being known. The limitations of such known systems arise from the lack of precision of the mechanical system employed and, in particular,of the optical units. Moreover, such known devices are expensive and delicate. Other known optical devices make use of the principle of .the camera or cinematograph camera. The image of the body to be measured is focused by means of a suitable optical system onto a sensor element consisting of a great number of photo sensitive elements arranged in line and spaced at known distan ces. By obtaining a great contrast between the image of the body being measured and its surroundings, this being a thing which can be done by placing an evenly illuminated background surface behind the body, it is relatively easy to pick out on the sen sor the image of the body to be measured. Measurement is performed by counting the number of photo sensitive elements obscured by the image of the body on the sensor. Moreover, according to this known art, when a simple photographic lens is used for the measurement, the ratio between the dimension of the body and the dimension of the image is not constant. The reason for this is that the ratio of magnification or reduction of the optical system depends on the ratio be between the distances of the sensor and of the body respectively from the centre of the lens, the body being able to move in three dimensional space, as we said earlier. Thus, to obtain enough data to determine the dimension of .the body, it is necessary to proceed to measure with a second..measurement device the distance of the body from the optical .centre of the lens of the first measurement device. The second measurement device is positioned conveniently. with its optical axis at a right angle to the first device and .also to the axis of the body being measured. Other types of known devices make it possible to obviate..such measurement of the distance of the body from the optical..centre of the lens employed, thereby simplifying the methods .of measurement considerably since it is no longer necessary to combine the data coming from the two devices so as to obtain .the measurement. For this purpose, only the luminous rays coming from the..illuminated background and being substantially parallel to the .optical axis of the system are used, and in this way the ratio .of magnification or reduction is made independent of the di. .stances. The employment of only the rays parallel to the optical . taxis is obtained by providing a spatial filter, or telecentric filter, which carries out selection of the rays reaching the .device from the zone of the body to be measured. Such spatial or telecentric filter consists of a stop positioned so as to .coincide with the rear focal point of a lens. In such known devices the beam of rays passing through the stop is projected onto a pair of linear sensors, each of.which consists of a plurality of photosensitive elements. Reading of the level of illumination of the various photosensitive elements is carried out by a scanning simultaneous .with the storage of the luminous information in the various .photosensitive elements. Thus,the various elements acquire da .ta at different moments. The result is that during such reading the actual value ..of the illumination of the individual photosensitive elements..may vary, for instance, because of vibrations or movements of..the body in question perpendicularly to the optical axis in such a way that precision may be reduced. Moreover, another disadvantage of such type of devices .lies in the fact that the projected image is not perfectly fo focused at the edges. In fact, this would require a stop having. a very stall aperture incompatible with the practical require ments of enough illumination of the sensors and therefore enough sensitivity. . The purpose of the present invention is to obviate the .drawbacks and disadvantages of the above known devices. A first purpose of the invention is to provide an optimum .focusing of the beam of rays striking the measurement sensor..This is obtained by providing an additional lens downstream .of the stop, or telecentric filter, of the device. This lens makes parallel the rays coming from the stop .and projects them onto the sensor with a magnification ratio . which can be pre set as required and be defined by the ratio .between the focal length of the second lens and that of the .first lens. The image thus obtained of the parallelized rays is well .defined and enables a stop to be employed with an aperture large enough to provide good luminosity without loss of defin ition. As a result, the sensitiveness of the device is increa sed as compared to the known art. As more light is thus available, it is possible to acceler .ate the scanning and thus to obtain a more accurate measurement..This is particularly advantageous when we bear in mind the spe .cific field of employment for which the device is primarily .intended, namely the measurement of dimensions of bodies under .going vibrations and displacements, such as rolled bars. The invention provides also for the use of a sensor in which the information relating to illumination is acquired byall the photosensitive elements at one and the same time within a given acquisition time. The means which govern the sensor and with which the de device is provided, control in fact a storage in parallel of the luminous information in all the photosensitive elements .within a determined interval.. Within a determined time a read out in series of the information received by each photosensitive element is then performed. In this way the information thus read is that stored by the various elements within the cited acquisition time. Thus, even if the body moves between one measurement andanother, the reading remains accurate since it gives the state acquired simultaneously by the various photosensitive elements .at the acquisition time. Since, as we said above, the invention provides better .illumination of the sensor, it is possible to reduce the acqui sition time and therefore to improve the accuracy of measure spent. Lastly, the invention provides a filter to eliminate un .desired wave lengths, such as those relative to radiations of..a thermal nature, for instance. In this way the optical system is enabled to work in a limited field of frequencies which is the optimum field for the optical system itself, thus preventing aberrations and loss .of definition. All the above advantages enhance the accuracy of the de .vice itself. This invention is therefore obtained with a procedure to measure the dimensions of a body in movement in a three dimen signal field, in which procedure the measurement is performed by projection of an image of such body onto a sensor with pho tosensitive elements arranged in line and rays substantially parallel to an optical axis substantially at a right angle to the direction of movement of the body to be measured are selec ted by a telecentric filter, the procedure being characterized in that the luminous rays downstream of such telecentric fil ter are made parallel for their projection onto the sensor. The invention is also embodied in an optoelectronic device to carry out the above procedure, such device comprising a front lens, a telecentric filter consisting of a stop positioned so as to coincide with the focus of the front lens, and a .sensor with photosensitive elements arranged in line, the de vice being characterized in that it comprises a rear lens po . positioned downstream of the stop and having its front focus co inciding with the aperture of the stop. The invention is described better with the following non.restrictive example and with the help of the attached figures, in which Fig.1 is a diagram of a side view of a device according to . the invention Fig.2 shows the output signal in the ideal case of an unmov ing body and perfectly focused rays Fig.3 shows the output signal in the case of a body moving . andlor not perfectly focused, and also shows the cor . rection which can be performed on the signal. Unless otherwise specified, we shall refer hereinafter to the case of use of the invention in the field of visible radiations, but it is to be understood that the principle of .the invention can also be employed with radiations of a fre . quench outside the visible range provided that a suitable mea. .surement device and suitable optical systems are provided. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity we shall refer in the .following example to measurement of the diameter of a body, .meaning thereby a dimension, such as a thickness of a bar, etc., .which is substantially at a right angle to the axis of the body .and to the optical axis of the system. Fig.1 shows diagrammatically a device according to the in .vention, in which 1 is a luminous contrasting background 2 is .a body of which it is desired to measure the diameter, the bo .dy being shown according to a section at a right angle to itstaxis of movement 3 is a field within which the body 2 is free to move while keeping its axis always substantially at a right .angle to the plane of its representation 4 is a diameter to. .be measured 5 is a front optical lens of the system, of which .the usable diameter must be at least equal to the dimension,in .a direction at a right angle to the optical axis 10, of the .field 3 in which the measurement has to be performed 6 is .the telecentric filter, which in this example consists of a circular stop having the functions of filtering the non paral .lel rays and of filtering the high spatial frequencies which ..would otherwise, in the form of spatial noise, disturb the ima ge of the object projected onto the measurement sensor 7 is. .a rear lens of the system, of which the usable diameter must ..be greater than the dimension of the sensor 8 is an optical.filter to eliminate the frequencies of the infrared near region, which could disturb the measurement if the body under examin ..ation has a rather high temperature as in hot rolling 9 is a linear sensor on which the image of the body to be measured .is created 10 is the optical axis of the system. The two lenses 5 and 7 have to be positioned in relation.to each other in such a way that the distance between them is.the sum of their focal distances. In other words the rear fo . cus of the lens 5 must coincide with the front focus of the .lens 7. The stop 6 must be positioned so as to coincide exactly .with the two above coinciding focal points. The ratio of magnification of the image in relation to .the body is, as is known, equal to the ratio between the focal distances of the two lenses 7 and 5 respectively. According to the invention the contrasting background 1 ..may have the aspect of a photoemissive or reflective screen or .may be any source of incoherent light provided that it is subs stantially homogeneous on a plane at a right angle to the op . optical axis 10. The spatial information relating to the image of the body .and measured by the sensor 7 is converted in a known manner .into momentary analogue information of the type shown in Fig.. .2. In this case the information is obtained in the form of a .voltage V. As can be seen in Fig.2, the signal 11 can take up two level corresponding respectively to the illumination low signal or obscuring high signal of the photosensitive ele .m nts of the sensor 9. In fact,the greater the number of photosensitive elements. included in the sensor 9 per unit of length, the more accurate .the measurement. The fact that for practical reasons the stop 6 does not .have an infinitesimal diameter entails in fact some limitations .as regards the positioning of the body 2 and sensor 9 in the .direction of the optical axis 10. In particular there is a plane, orthogonal to the optical .axis 10 and within the field 3 of measurement, the objects positioned on which produce a perfectly focused image on the pla ne of the sensor 9. To such perfectly focused image there cor .responds an output signal 11 of the sensor 9 which has very steep faces 12 and is therefore easy and accurate to read Fig.2 . When the body 2 does not lie on the aforesaid plane ortho zonal to the optical axis 10, the image on the sensor 9 will .be out of focus. However, such out of focus condition will be less so than what occurs with known devices, given equal illumination of the sensor 9. In correspondence with such out of focus condition there .will be an output signal having a trapezoidal isosceles deve lopment and therefore having inclined faces 12, as shown in Fig.3. The more distant the body 2 is from the aforesaid prefer .red plane, the greater will such effect be. However, this occurrence does not impair the performance .of the device to any great extent because it is of a minimal. value when related to the displacement of the body from the .preferred plane, and because it can be fully eliminated accor .ding to the invention by a suitable conditioning of the signal 11 generated by the sensor 9. Such conditioning of the signal consists merely in passm .ing the signal through a level comparator, which converts the .analogue signal 11 generated by the sensor 9 into a logic sig zonal 14. The threshold 13 of the comparator will be preferably equal to the mean value of the two levels, maximum and minimum, .of the signal. In a like manner, when the body 2 undergoes vibrations . .an output signal with a trapezoidal type development will be .obtained correspondingly. In this case too the above type of conditioning of the signal will eliminate fully any possible ty of error in the measurement of the diameter of the body. The sensor 9 employed can be, for instance, of a CCD type .or the like. The behaviour of the sensor 9 will be advantage ously such as to enable, as we said earlier, simultaneous sto .rage of the information relating to the illumination in all . the elementary photosensitive elements. Instead, the reading .takes place in series , that is, a reading of the various ele .ments in succession within a pre set reading time during which the photosensitive elements retain the information acquired .previously. .
