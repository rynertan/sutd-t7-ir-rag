# Variable speed rotary electrical machines.

## Abstract
Variable speed rotary electrical machines, specifically induction motors and motor drive systems. A main induction motor 15 and an auxiliary induction motor 17 have respective stators 21 housed in a common housing 19 and have respective rotors 23, 27 which are electrically con catenated and mounted on a common shaft 29 . The main stator 21 is supplied with a constant a.c. voltage by a main inverter 35 connected to a constant voltage d.c. link 45, 47, 43 and the auxiliary stator is supplied with a variable a.c. voltage by an auxiliary inventor 37 which is forced commutated and connected to a variable voltage d.c. link. A controller 40 controls the gating of the inverters 35, 37 and enables the forced commutated inverter 37 to supply an a.c. signal of selected frequency and voltage level to the auxiliary stator such that a prescribed reactive power will be coupled through the auxiliary and main rotors 27, 23 to the main stator 21 to cause the latter to appear to constitute a leading power factor load, permitting the main inverter 35 to be line commutated and supplied from a substantially constant voltage d.c. link. Alternatively, a drive system may comprise a plurality of the machines each with a main motor and an auxiliary motor. The stators of the main machines are all supplied from a single common main inverter which is line commutated and the stators of the auxiliary machines are separately supplied from separate forced commutated auxiliary inverters.
