However, both compositions have at least one of such disadvantages that gas bubbles may be often produced owing to the generation of gases at the time of light irradiation, an odious smell is strong, a variety of colors developed is poor, durability and long term preservation property are poor due to lack of stability against heat and humidity, and so on. The reversible photosensitive composition has at least one of such disadvantages, in addition to the abovementioned disadvantages, as poor color disappearing property at the time of interruption of light irradiation, poor durability in repeated use, difficulties in availability of materials, difficulties in work onto materials and so on.Accordingly, there has no photosensitive composition satis factory for the multi purpose use in industrial viewpoint yet. That is, the photosensitive composition is required to have properties of color sensitivity in which color is rapidly developed by light irradiation, a variety of colors developed, high color density, no odious smell, no generation of gases at the time of light irradiation, high durability against heat and humidity, stability in long term preservation, abundant variety of colors, easiness in availability of materials, easiness in work onto materials, and so on.

Another object of the present invention is to provide novel photosensitive compositions by which color sensitivity can be improved at the time of light irradiation. Still another object of the present invention is to provide novel photosensitive compositions which are satisfactory for performance necessary for the reversible photosensitive composition.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As the results of various investigations as to the improvement of the conventional photoactivators each having a defect in practical use, the inventors of this application have found that the desired objects can be attained in the case where a photoactivator selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group VIa in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Va in the periodic table is used in combination with an electron donative chromatic organic compound. That is, the inventors have found that in the case where a salt selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group VIa in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Va in the periodic table is used in combination with an electron donative chromatic organic compound, the foregoing salt releases rapidly color forming components such as Brfnstead acid,Lewis acid, and the like so as to immediately cause the electron donative chromatic organic compound to color without producing gas bubbles even if irradiated with light.The inventors have further found that the foregoing salt is an extremely superior photoactivator in that the foregoing salt per se has no odious smell and has high durability as well as a long term preservation property are good due to stability against heat and humidity. Thus, the inventors have found that the compositions in which the foregoing photoactivator is combined with an electron donative chromatic organic compound are superior novel photosensitive compositions in which the disadvantages in the prior art are completely eliminated. This point is the most significant feature of the present invention. Next, the photosensitive composition in which a compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups coexists with the foregoing photosensitive composition 1 , could have improvement in color sensitivity without deteriorating the performance of the photosensitive composition 1 . This point is a significant feature of the invention. Next, the photosensitive composition in which at least one of a compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder coexists with the photosensitive composition 1 , could have a property of color disappearance owing to interruption of light irradiation with respect to a coloring matter having color developed owing to light irradiation, that is, a so called photochromic property, without deteriorating the performance of the photosensitive composition 1 . Also this point is a significant feature of the invention. Next, the photosensitive composition in which a compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups coexists with the photosensitive composition 3 , could have improvement in color sensitivity without deteriorating the performance of the photosensitive composition 3 , and more, could have a property of color disappearance owing to interruption of light irradiation with respect to a coloring matter having color developed owing to light irradiation, that is, a socalled photochromic property. Also this point is a significant feature of the invention. A combination of 1 an electron donative chromatic organic compound and a photoactivator selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group VIa in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging toGroup Va in the periodic table 2 an electron donative chromatic organic compound, a photoactivator selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Via in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Va in the periodic table, and a compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups 3 an electron donative chromatic organic compound, a photoactivator selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group VIa in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Va in the periodic table, and at least one of a compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder or 4 an electron donative chromatic organic compound, a photoactivator selected from the group consisting of an aromatic halonium salt, an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group VIa in the periodic table and an aromatic onium salt of elements belonging to Group Va in the periodic table, at least one of a compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder, and a compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups is novel.Although the combination was found to have good properties as a photosensitive composition, the reason why such good properties could be shown would be thought vaguely as follows. When light is irradiated onto the photosensitive composition, color forming components such as Brfnstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like, to color sensitively the electron donative chromatic organic compound are released from the photoactivator and then the electron donative chromatic organic compound is colored by these color forming components. It has been found that if a compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups coexists the photosensitive composition exhibits superior properties in which the electron donative chromatic organic compound is colored in a moment of light irradiation. That is, it is to be supposed that the color forming components such as Branstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like are rapidly produced by the interaction between the photoactivator and the compound having alcoholic hydroxyl groups, so that the electron donative chromatic organic compound donates electrons to the color forming components and color is developed in a moment. In the photosensitive composition in which at least one of a compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder coexists with the foregoing photosensitive composition 1 or 2 , the electron donative chromatic organic compound is colored by the color forming components such as Br nstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like, released from the photoactivator owing to light irradiation.However, if the light irradiation is interrupted, the releasing of the color forming components such as Br nstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like, from the photoactivator is stopped and at the same time at least one of the compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder begins to absorb the color forming components such as Brfnstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like, so that the electron donative chromatic organic compound is decolored. That is, the electron donative chromatic organic compound which has been colored accepts electrons, and consequently, at least one of the compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder absorbs all of the color forming components such as Brfnstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like, which have been released from the photoactivator.In the photosensitive composition comprising at least one of the compound having oxyethylene groups and basic fine powder according to the present invention, it is to be supposed that the electron donative chromatic organic compound donates and accepts electrons corresponding to the presence of light, so that color is developed or disappears. That is, the photosensitive composition can be that having socalled photochromic property. The electron donative chromatic organic compound used according to the present invention is generally colorless or light colored, and has the property of color developed by the donation of electrons owing to the action of the color forming components such as Br nstead acid, Lewis acid, and the like. As the compound to be used, triphenylmethanephthalides, fluorans, phenothiazines, indolylphthalides, leucoauramines, rhodamine lactams, rhodamine lactones, indolines, triphonylmethanes, azaphthalides, chromenoindols, triazenes, etc., are preferable, and triphenylmethanephthalides, fluorans, indolylphthalides, leucoauramines, rhodamine lactams, triphenylmethanes, azaphthalides, etc., are more preferable.
