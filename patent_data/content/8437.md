# Resistor and or conductor composition comprising a hexaboride conductive material.

## Abstract
Thick film resistors end conductors compatible with cop per and fireable in nonoxidizing atmosphere are provided. The resistors are based on certain hexaboride conductors such as LaBâ‚† and glasses which are thermodynamically stable to or nonreducible by the hexaborides. Thick film pastes pre pared with small particle size hexaboride and certain ethylene vinyl acetate polymeric vehicles afford resistors hav ing improved temperature coefficient of resistance and coef ficient of variation.
