# End closure for flexible plastic tubes.

## Abstract
The ends of flexible plastic tubes 20 , particularly of relatively thin wall thickness, are closed with a cylindrical header 10 or end plug over which an end of the plastic tube 20 is fitted. A fluids tight connection between the wall of the plastic tube 20 and the cylindrical header 10 or plug is made by press fitting over the connection area a plastic ring 25 smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the plastic tube 20 within the elastic limit of the plastic ring 25 . Preferably the header 10 and or end plug have circumferen tial grooves 13 or depressions into which groove 13 or depression the wall of the tube 20 is fitted or depressed, preferably by multi turns of plastic thread 21 . For corrosive and oxidizing environments the header 10 , plug, plastic tube 20 , sealing rings and depressing thread 21 are composed of perfluorocarbon polymers.
