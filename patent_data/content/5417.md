# Multiple layer protective glass.

## Abstract
A multiple layer protective glass, particularly a protective glass for a welding shield, for damping the light transmission, the layers of which are in turn comprised at least of a first polarizer 2 , a first electrooptical cell 3 , a second polarizer 4 , a second electrooptical cell 5 and a third polarizer 6 , the electrooptical cells consisting of liquid crystals 9a and 9b respectively enclosed between transparent parallel plates 7a, 8a und 7b, 8b respectively coated with electrically conducting layers 10a,11a und 10b, 11b respectively , said crystals being arranged in their non excited condition to form a helically twisted structure for rotating the plane of polarization of the passing polarized light. The planes of polarization of the first and the second polarizer 2, 4 are at right angles to each other, that the planes of polarization of the second and the third polarizer 4, 6 enclose an angle which is between 0 and 60 . The angle of rotation of the helical structure formed by the liquid crystals in the second electrooptical cell 5 is between 90 and 30 and the said angle and the angle of rotation are complementary angles. Means 13 are provided for exciting the two electrooptical cells 3, 5 in opposite modes by the application of a voltage between the conducting layers 10a, 11a 10b, 11b of the electrooptical cell.
