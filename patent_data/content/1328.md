## Description
Method and composition for Combating Weeds This invention relates to combating weeds. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of combating weeds at a locus infested or liable to be infested with than, which method canprises applying to the locus a a diphenyl ether herbicide andCb at least one of dichlorprop and mecoprop. The invention provides also a herbicidal composition comprising a and Cb . It has been found that the present combination of herbicides has a surprisingly good combination of safety to crops and activity against weeds. It is active against a wide spectrum of weeds e.g. in cereal crops. Particularly surprising, however, is its high level of safety to crops, e.g. cereal crops. Component Ca is a herbicide having the structllre EMI1.1 in which RÚ, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen or a substituent. Preferably RÚ, R2 R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R and R10 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen, halogen e.g.chlorine , alkoxycarbonyl of 2 7 carbon atones e.g. methoxy carbonyl , nitro, alkoxy of 1 6 carbon atoms e.g. methoxy ,EMI2.1 where R11 represents alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms e.g. methyl or isobutyl or trifluoromethyl. In a particular embodiment, R1 represents hydrogen R2 represents hydrogen R represents nitro,EMI2.2 where R11 represents alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms R4 represents alkoxycarbonyl of 2 7 carbon atoms, or alkoxy of 1 6 carbon atoms RS represents hydrogen represents hydrogen, halogen,. or nitro e.g. halogen or nitro R7 represents hydrogen R8 represents halogen, alkoxy of 1 6 carbon atoms, or trifluoromethyl represents hydrogen and R10 represents hydrogen. Component a may be selected for instance from the group consisting of bifenox methyl 5 2,4 dichlorophenoxy 2nitrobenzoate , chlomethoxynil 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy 2 methoxy1 nitrobenzene , chloroxuran 3 4 4 chlorophenoxy phenyl 1,1 dimethylurea ,difenoxuran 3 4 4 methoxyphenoxy phenyl 1,1 dimethylurea , clofop isobutyl isobutyl 2 4 4chlorophenoxy phenoxy propionate ,diclofop methyl methyl 2 4 4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propionate , fluorodifen 2 nitro 1 4 nitrophenoxy 4 trifluoromethylbenzene , and nitrofen 2,4 dichloro 1 nitrophenoxy benzene . Component b is dichlorprop 2 2,4 dichlorophenoxy propionic acid or a salt or ester thereof and or mecoprop C.2 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy propanoic acid or a salt or ester thereof . Component a may be a mixture of diphenyl ether herbicides. Component b may be a mixture of dichlorprop and mecoprop, though this is not preferred. Where a herbicide, e.g. dichlorprop, is normally available commercially as a racemate even though only one isomer is herbicidally active it may be used as the racemate or just the active isomer in the present invention. Rates and proportions in such a case given in this specification refer, as is usual, to amounts of racemate where the racemate is not employed, corresponding rates and proportions can readily be calculated. Component b can be employed, as is usual, in the form of a salt or functional derivative of its acid. The salt may be for instance an alkali metal salt, e.g. a sodium or potassium salt, or an amine salt, e.g. an ammonium, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, allylamine, benzylamine, butylamine, dibutylamine, tributyl amine, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, methylamine, morpholine or piperidine salt. The functional derivative is generally an ester.The ester may be for instance an alkyl of 1 6 carbon atom ester e.g. methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl ester. Where rates and proportions are given in this specification for component b , they refer, as is conventional, to equivalent amounts of acid. In a preferred embodiment, component a is bifenox. The proportions of component a to component b can vary over a wide range, depending for instance on the particular components and use employed. Each component is usually employed as 1 100 parts. Parts, proportions and percentages in this specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated.Generally the proportions of component a , e.g. bifenox, to component Cb are from 1 15 to 15 1, e.g. from 1 4 to 4 1, though in the case of particularly active a components their amount may be less, e.g. from 1 70 to 15 1 for instance from 1 70 to 1 4. Usually there is only a single a component. The essential herbicides are preferably applied together in a composition comprising a and b . Usually the compositions are initially produced in the form of concentrates, e.g.containing 0.5 85t in toto of a and cub , and these concentrates are diluted with water or hydrocarbon, usually water, for application, generally such that the concentration in toto of a and b is 0.05 5t, though in ultra low volume application the concentration may be higher, e.g. up to 20 . Thus, the present compositions usually contain 0.05 858 in toto of a and b The compositions normally contain a surface active agent and or a carrier. The carrier may be a liquid, e.g. water e.g. water used to dilute a concentrate for application . If water is employed as carrier in a concentrate, an organic solvent may also be present as carrier, though this is not usually employed. A surface active agent may advantageously be present. The carrier may be a liquid other than water, for example an organic solvent, such as a water immiscible solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C, in which a and b are dissolved or suspended. A concentrate containing a water immiscible solvent suitably also contains a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self tiulsifiabIe oil on admixture with water. The carrier may be a solid, which may be finely divided. Examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, silicas, silicates, lignosuiphonates, peat and solid fertilizers. The carrier can be of natural or synthetic origin or can be a modified natural material. Wettable powders soluble or dispersable in water may be formed by admixing a and b in particulate form with a particulate carrier or spraying molten compound on to the particulate carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent and finely grinding the whole powder mixture. An aerosol composition may be formed by admixting a and b with a propellant e.g. a polyhalogenated alkane such as dichlorodifluoromethane, and suitably also with a solvent. A flowable suspension concentrate may be formed by grinding a and b with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. A flowable suspension concentrate wherein the carrier is a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 270 C rather than water may be formed. the the present composition can for example be solid e.g. dust or granules and contain a solid carrier or liquid Ce.g. an emulsifiable concentrate and contain a liquid carrier which is a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 270 C. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well in in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example nono or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, petroleum sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkyl naphthalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates e.g.the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alk substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7 ,9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quarternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylarmnonium bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphnnates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoylN methylauride, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. a and b may be in admixture with a non phytotoxic oil or with an antidote a substance having the property of improving the selectivity of herbicides . The non phytotoxic oil can be for instance Fyzol lIE, Agri Oil Plus or Sun Oil llE. The antidote may be for instance N,N diallyl 2, 2 dichloroacetamide or l,8 naphthalic anhydride. a and Cb may be in admixture with ammonium sulphate which improves the activity of some herbicides. a and b may be in admixture with fertilizers. a and Cb can be mixed together immediately before use.Desirably, however, they would already have been mixed. The invention provides a one pack presentation, in which a and b are already mixed, and also a single package adapted to hold a and b in separate containers, for sequential use or for mixing, e.g. in a spray tank, for application. Instead of applying a and b together in a composition such as is discussed above, they can be applied separately in analogous compositions containing just a or Cb , narticularly as the whole or a part of a chesnical weed control programme in a crop season. For instance, b may be applied before a , e.g. 1 3 days before a . a and b can be applied for total herbicidal action, but preferably the invention is employed for selective herbicidal action in a crop. The crop is preferably a cereal crop, e.g.wheat, barley, corn, maize, or rice, or sorghum, and especially winter wheat or spring barley, particularly spring barley. The present composition and method may be employed pre emergence of the crop, though preferably they are employed post emergence of the crop. A further pesticide can be employed with a and b . The further pesticide can be for instance a herbicide, insecticide or fungicide, particularly another herbicide, e.g. isoproturon 3 4 isopropylphenyl 1,1 dimethylurea or bentazone 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothiadizin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide The further pesticide is particularly one known for use on cereal crops. A composition comprising a mixture of a , b and the further pesticide can be applied.Alternatively, a and b can be applied separately with the further pesticide admixed with a or b . Usually the proportions of Cb to the further pesticide are from 1 10 to 10 1. Plants, the soil, land or aquatic areas can be treated by the present method. The method is preferably employed for selectively combating weeds at a locus at which a crop is growing or, less preferably, is to grow. In the present method, usually 0.1 8 kg, preferably 0.5 4 kg, in toto of a and Cb are applied per hectare. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Examples 1 In a series of comparative tests, bifenox nfas applied in the field alone or in admixture with mecoprop to plots of spring barley variety Maris Mink at growth stage 14 22 on the Zadoks scale. Phytotoxicity to the crop and weed control were assessed in comparison with untreated control plots. The bifenox was employed as a 211 aitulsifiable concentrate and the mecoprop as a solution of the potassium salt in water.In each case the concentrate or concentrates were admixed with water and applied by spraying in the conventional way.
