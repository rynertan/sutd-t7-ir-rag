# An image receptor and method for producing an opaque print thereon.

## Abstract
An opaque reflective print copy 20 is produced by transferring via heat and pressure an electrophotographical ly formed toner image to a presoftened transparent thermo plastic thin layer 14 bonded to an opaque substrate 12 . The print is formed of at least one generally planar toner image layer embedded in the plastic layer. Light illuminating the print enters the thin layer 14 and is reflected from the interface 16 between said layer and said substrate, passing through the toner particles 18 as well as being reflected from the toner particles themselves, whereby to provide an image having greater depth intensity and contrast than can be obtained using silver halide photographic film, all without distortion of the image, loss in density or loss in resolution. The substrate 12 can have a smooth or roughened surface 16 and can be selected from plain or coated paper, metal, stone, stretchable and or inflatable media as well as irregu larly shaped objects. Successive toner images may be applied superimposed one on the other in layers and in registry by softening the thermoplastic layer 14 after transfer thereto of one toner image and applying the next toner image to the softened layer successively. The interme diate heating embeds the toner image, transparentizes the image and readies the receptor to receive the next toner image.
