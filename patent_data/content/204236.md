# SMALL PARTICLE ZEOLITE CONTAINING CATALYTIC CRACKING CATALYST

## Abstract
A catalyst composition containing 5 to 50 weight percent of small particle type Y faujasite zeolite is described. A cracking process using the above catalyst can be used to obtain increased conversion of the heavier portion of commercial crudes as well as to generate increased yield of gasoline and distillate.
