# Apparatus and method for applying a liquid to a surface.

## Abstract
The invention provides apparatus and a method for applying a liquid to a surface. The apparatus comprises a nozzle 1 for directing a continuous stream of drops 5 of uniform size and spacing in a direction to traverse and not impinge on a surface 7 to which the liquid is to be applied, means 8,9 for effecting relative movement between a said stream of drops 5 and a said surface 7 in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel of the stream of drops, charge electrode means 10 for selectively electrically charging the drops of liquid in said stream, and deflecting means 11 or 11,12 for establishing a steady electric field about the path of travel of said stream of drops for deflecting the electrically charged drops onto said surface.
