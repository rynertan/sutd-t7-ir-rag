# Infra red target detection arrangements.

## Abstract
An infra red target detection arrangement in which a row of eight infra red detectors 3 are scanned repeatedly over a section 5 of a field 4 of view to perform eight line scans simultaneously, the detector outputs being accumulated in respective stores for each of a number of points in a scan. The detectors are then stepped by half of a line space to provide repeated interlaced scans. If a target is detected the arrangement may be switched to a mode in which the field of view is scanned at a rate compatible with a conventional raster television display.
