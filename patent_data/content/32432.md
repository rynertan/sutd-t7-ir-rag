## Description
Prostanoid compounds and their preparation and pharmaceutical formulation Prostaglandins are a class of naturally occurring cyclopentane derivatives which are biologically active in many physiological systems and they and substances which antagonise their effects are therefore of considerable interest in both human and veterinary medicine. In view of the activity found in the natural prostaglandins, considerable effort has been directed towards the preparation of synthetic analogues.Many such compounds have been described, and in general it has been reported that these compounds possess activity within the same spectrum as the natural compounds. The synthetic compounds can however have increased selectivity of action, longer duration of activity or different potency, and in some cases they can antagonise the activity of natural prostaglandins. In most of the synthetic prostanoids previously reported, the side chains have been attached to the cyclopentane ring via carbon atoms, as in the natural prostaglandin structure. We have now found a new class of prostanoid compounds in which the a side chain has the same or similar structure to that of the natural compounds, while the a side chain is attached to the ring via a nitrogen atom and the ring is also substituted by certain aralkoxy or heteroaralkoxy groups. Compounds in this class have shown prostanoid activity in our tests and in particular they inhibit blood platelet aggregation and have bronchodilatatory action. The invention provides prostanoids of the general formula 1 EMI2.1 in which A representsEMI2.2 X is cis or trans CH CH or CH2 2 R1 is straight or branched C alkyl bearing as a terminal substituent COOR10 where R10 is a hydrogen atom, C1 6 alkyl or C7 10 aralkyl e.g. benzyl y represents i NRêR where Rê and R are the same or different and are each a hydrogen atom, aralkyl having a C17 alkyl portion or C1 10 alkyl, both alkyls being optionally substituted by one or more substituents OR7 where R7 is a hydrogen atom,C1 7 alkyl, aryl or aralkyl having a C14 alkyl portion or NR8R9 where R8 and R9 are the same or different and are each a hydrogen atom or C1 4 alkyl, or where NR8R9 is a saturated heterocyclic amino group as defined below for Y any aryl group in R2 or R3 being optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl or trifluoromethyl groups always provided that the total number of carbon atoms in the group NR2R3 does not exceed 15 or ii a saturated heterocyclic amino group which has 5 8 ring members and a optionally contains in the ring 0 , S , SO2, NR14 where R14 is a hydrogen atom, C1 7 alkyl or aralkyl having a C14 alkyl portion , C OH R6 where R6 is a hydrogen atom, C1 7 alkyl, phenyl, or aralkyl having a C14 alkyl portion and or b is optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl groups R4 is i aralkyl having a C 1 3 alkyl portion and the aryl portion being substituted by C13 alkylthio, C13 alkylsulphinyl, C13 alkylsulphonyl, C1 3 alkanoylamino, aroylamino e.g. benzoylamino , phenylalkyl having a C13 alkyl portion, aminosulphonyl, the amino group being optionally substituted by one or two C1 3 alkyl groups , C1 3 alkanoylaminosulphonyl two 1 3 the amino group being optionally substituted byC1 3 alkyl , phenylsulphonyl the phenyl portion being optionally substituted by C13 alkyl , nitro, tetrazol 5 yl, phenyl substituted by R5 where R5 is C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen or phenyl , or thienyl or ii the group EMI3.1 where alk is C13 alkylene Z is 0 or S R11 is a hydrogen atom C1 6 alkyl C1 6 alkoxy aryl e.g. phenyl or phenylalkoxy or phenylalkyl having a C1 3 alkyl portion the aryl portion in each case being optionally substituted by C1 3 alkyl,C1 3 alkoxy or halogen aryloxy e.g. phenoxy C5 7 cycloalkyl halogen or nitro and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof. The formulae used herein are to be understood to depict either or both optical isomers of each of the compounds concerned as well as mixtures of the isomers, including racemates, even though the precise structure as set out only relates to one optical isomer. Compounds having the ring type b are particularly important. In the group CH2XR1, the alkyl portion of the group R1 may for example contain 2 5 carbon atoms straight or branched and is preferably CH2 3COOR10. R10 is preferably a hydrogen atom or C14 alkyl, e.g. methyl, particularly hydrogen. When R1 is terminally substituted by COOH, the compounds are capable of salt formation with bases, examples of suitable salts being alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium , alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium , ammonium, substituted ammonium e.g.tromethamine or dimethylaminoethanol , piperazine, morpholine, piperidine and tertiary amine e.g. triethylamine salts. X is preferably CH2CH2 or cis CH CH , particularly the latter. In the group Y, when one of R2 and R3 is alkyl or substituted alkyl, the alkyl group preferably contains no more than 7 e.g. 2 7 carbon atoms and preferably has a straight chain. Examples of such groups are n hexyl and n heptyl. In such compounds, the other group of R2 or R3 is preferably hydrogen or methyl. When R2 or R3 is an aralkyl group, it may for example be benzyl, phenethyl or phenpentyl. In the optional substituent OR7 on R2 or R3, examples of R7 are a hydrogen atom, methyl, n butyl, phenyl, benzyl and phenethyl. The optional amino substituent NR8R9 may for example be NH2, NHMe, NHEt, NMe2 or NEt2. These optional substituents may for example be carried at the B position, as in 3 hydroxyalkyl groups. Two oR7 groups may be present, particularly on an R2 or R3 alkyl group for example, there may be a hydroxy group at the ss position and a second OR7 group at the terminal position. Aryl e.g. phenyl groups in R2 and R3 may themselves be substituted, e.g. by C14 alkyl or trifluoromethyl. Compounds in which Y is a saturated heterocyclic amino group are however preferred. The types of heterocyclic group which are generally preferred are those in which the ring has 5 8 members and a optionally contains 0 , S , SO2 or NR14 and or b is optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl e.g. methyl groups. The group may for example have a 5, 6 or 7 membered ring, e.g. pyrrolidino, piper idino, morpholino, piperazino, thiamorpholino, l dioxothiamorpholino, homomorpholino and hexamethyleneimino. Examples of the optional substituents which may be present on a second nitrogen atom in the ring are methyl, ethyl and benzyl. The carbon atoms of the heterocyclic rings may for example be substituted by methyl or ethyl. The group , C OH R6 may for example be present in a piperidino ring and whenR6 is other than hydrogen it may for example be methyl, ethyl or butyl. Compounds in which Y is a morpholino, dioxothiamorpholino or piperidino group are particularly preferred. The amino group in the group Y enables the compounds to form salts with inorganic or organic acids, e.g. hydrochlorides, sulphates, acetates, maleates and succinates. When R4 is aralkyl, it is preferably an arylmethyl particularly benzyl group substituted by C13 alkylthio e.g. methylthio , C13 alkylsulphinyl e.g. methylsulphinyl , Cl 3 alkanoylamino e.g. acetylamino , C13 alkylsulphonyl e.g. methylsulphonyl , arylsulphonyl e.g. phenylsulphonyl , aminosulphonyl e.g. dimethylaminosulphonyl , phenylalkyl e.g. phenethyl or benzyl , phenyl substituted by the group R5 where R5 represents C14 alkyl e.g. methyl , C14 alkoxy e.g. methoxy , halogen e.g. chlorine , or phenyl , or thienyl. Particularly preferred substituents of this type are phenylalkyl e.g. phenethyl or benzyl , or, more particularly, phenyl substituted by C13 alkoxy e.g.methoxy or C13 alkyl e.g. methyl . When R4 is a group of the type ii the alkylene group is preferably methylene, and Z is preferably µ. Where Z is S, the thienyl group is preferably substituted by C13 alkyl e.g. methyl , aryl e.g.phenyl, optionally substituted by C13 alkoxy, e.g.methoxy , C57 cycloalkyl e.g. cyclohexyl , halogen e.g. bromine or phenalkyl e.g. phenethyl , and where Z is p the furanyl group is preferably substituted by an aryl, e.g. phenyl group. Particularly preferred groups of this type are phenylthienylalkyl and alkoxyphenylthienylalkyl. A particularly preferred group of compounds has the formula l b where X is cis CH CH , R1 is CH2 3COOH, Y is morpholino, piperidino, or l dioxothiamorpholino, and R4 is benzyl substituted by phenethyl, benzyl, methoxyphenyl or methylphenyl, or is methoxyphenylthienylmethyl. As indicated above, our tests have shown that compounds of formula 1 inhibit blood platelet aggregation and or have bronchodilatatory activity. The test we have used for bronchodilatation is as described by K.M. Lulich, et al in British Journal of Pharmacology 58, 71 79, 1976 except guinea pig lung is used instead of cat lung. The test for inhibition of platelet aggregation is as described by G.V. Born in Nature 194, 927 929 1962 except collagen is used instead of ADP as the pro aggregatory agent. The compounds are thus of interest in the treatment of asthma and as antithrombotic agents for use in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases or conditions such as arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarcts. They may be formulated for use in conventional manner, with one or more pharmaceutical carriers. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, syrups, or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable excipients. The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injections or continuous infusion. Formulations for injections may be presented in unit dosage form in ampoules, or in multi dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen free water. For administration by inhalation the compounds are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurised packs or a nebuliser, or as a cartridge from which the powdered composition may be inhaled with the aid of a suitable device.In the case of a pressurised aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. For use as antithrombotic agents, the compounds are preferably administered orally, for example in amounts of 0.1 to 10 mg kg body weight, 1 to 4 times daily. For use in the treatment of asthma, the compounds may also be administered orally in amounts of 0.1 to 10 mg kg body weight, 1 to 4 times daily preferably however they are administered by inhalation in the form of aerosols or solutions for nebulisers, at doses varying from 0.3 to 30 mg, 1 to 4 times daily.The compounds may be used in combination with other anti asthmatic agents. It will be appreciated that the precise dose administered will always depend on the age and condition of the patient. The compounds of formula 1 may be prepared by selection and adaptation of methods known in prostanoid chemistry see for example British Patent Specification 2028805A . Method a below is particularly important in forming certain prostanoids of the desired class, and other compounds in tbe class can be prepared from them by known techniques for example using one or more of methods b to m below. The following reactions will frequently require the use of or will conveniently be applied to starting materials having protected functional groups e.g.hydroxy . It is to be understood that references to the use of starting materials of a particular structure are intended to include starting materials having protected functional groups. Certain of the reactions described below are capable of affecting other groups in the starting material which are desired in the end product, and this must be taken into account when performing multi stage reactions. In the discussion below the groups X and Y and the various R groups are as defined above except where otherwise indicated. a Compounds of formula 2 EMI8.1 where Rla is as defined above for R1 where R10 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by reacting lactols of formula 3 or their aldehyde isomers of formula EMI9.1 with appropriate Wittig reagents, e.g. a phosphorane of formula R312 P CHRla where R12 is C16 alkyl or aryl, e.g. monocyclic aryl such as phenyl , or a salt thereof, e.g. the potassium salt. Suitable reaction solvents include hydrocarbons e.g. benzene and toluene , ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran , dialkylsulphoxides e.g. dimethylsulphoxide , alcohols and halogenated hydrocarbons. The reaction may be carried out at any suitable temperature up to 500C, preferably at room temperature. The reaction is particularly suitable for the preparation of compounds in which R1 is terminally substituted by COOH in salt form . Any hydroxy group in Y should preferably be in a protected state prior to this reaction. Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are described below. Any NH2 group present should also be protected, e.g. by t butoxycarbonyl. Except as regards the nature of R4, this reaction is the same as process a of British Patent Specification 2028805A. The intermediates of formulae 3 and 3a may thus be prepared by the methods described in that specification, using starting materials containing the desired R4 group. These starting materials may themselves be prepared by the same general methods as described in Specification 2028805A. However, when R4 is an aralkyl group substituted by phenylmethyl, substituted phenyl or thienyl, it can be more convenient to introduce first an aralkyl R4 group substituted by halo after the formation of the intermediate lactone, this group can then be modified to form the desiredR4 group, for example by treatment with the appropriate aryl or benzyl zinc halide in the presence of a catalyst such as Ni PPH3 4 or C12Pd PPh3 2 diisobutylaluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at e.g.100 ambient temperature. b Compounds of ring type b may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding hydroxy compound of ring type a , for example with a Cr111 oxidising reagent, e.g. Jones reagent, at 10 to room temperature, preferably 10 0 , in a solvent such as acetone.Other conventional methods can also be used, for example using dimethylsulphoxide and a suitable electrophilic reagent, such as acetyl bromide, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene at low temperature e.g. 700. With the latter reagent, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid or its pyridinium salt. Other suitable reagents are N chlorosuccinimidedimethylsulphide complex used for example in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as toluene, e.g. at 05C , and pyridine sulphur trioxide complex in dimethylsulphoxide e.g. at Oc to room temperature . When the side chain has a terminal COOH group i.e. when R10 is hydrogen , better yields are sometimes obtained by prior protecting the carboxyl group, for example in the form of a trialkyl e.g.trimethyl or triethyl silyl ester. Any other hydroxy group present should be protected in this reaction. c Compounds in which R10 is alkyl or aralkyl can be prepared by esterification of the corresponding carboxylic acid in which R10 is hydrogen . Conventional esterification techniques may be used, reaction with a diazoalkane being preferred. The alkyl esters may also be formed by reaction with an appropriate alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. d Compounds in which R1 is terminally substituted by a COOH group can be prepared by saponifying a corresponding ester, e.g. using KOH or NaOH in methanol. e Compounds in which X is trans CH CH may be prepared by isomerising the corresponding cis compound.The isomerisation may be effected by treatment with, for example, p toluene sulphinic acid in dioxan e.g.at reflux or azobisisobutyronitrile and thiophenol, using for example a hydrocarbon solvent and any suitable temperature up to reflux. Where an oxo group is desired in the end product, it should be introduced after this reaction. f Compounds in which X is CH2 2 may be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of a correspnding compound in which X is CH CH . Conventional catalysts may be used, preferably palladium or platinum on carbon, in a suitable solvent e.g. an alcohol such as methanol e.g. at room temperature. g Compounds of formula la may be prepared by etherification of the corresponding hydroxy compound in which R4 represents hydrogen , for example by reaction with an appropriate halide R4 Hal , for example by reaction at room temperature in the presence of a suitable base e.g. sodium hydride in a suitable solvent e.g. dimethylformamide . Any other hydroxy group present in the starting material e.g. the ring hydroxy group should be protected in this reaction. Starting materials for this reaction may be prepared by the same general technique as described above for process a , using intermediates in which the group OR4 is a protected hydroxy group and removing the protecting group prior to etherification. Starting materials of the formula 4 EMI12.1 where Rla is as defined above and ORh represents a protected hydroxy group may also be prepared by method b of British Patent Specification 2028805A. h Compounds having ring type a can be prepared by removing the protecting group from the corresponding compound in which the ring hydroxy group is protected, for example by reduction or acid or alkaline hydrolysis.This is discussed below in connection with hydroxy group protection. i Compounds in which R4 is aralkyl substituted by alkanoylamino may be prepared by acylation of the corresponding amine, e.g. with the appropriate acid anhydride in an organic base such as pyridine at OOC. j Compounds of formula la in which R4 is aralkyl substituted by alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding alkylthio compound with a peracid for example peracetic acid at room temperature. k Compounds of formula la in which Y is a substituted amino group may be prepared by substitution of the corresponding compound in which Y is NH2. This reaction may be performed by treating the starting material with a compound of the formulaJR13J, where J is a readily displaceable group such as halo, e.g. iodo, or hydrocarbylsulphonyloxy, e.g. p toluenesulphonyloxy and R13 is the appropriate divalent group e.g. CH2 2O CH2 2 . The reaction may be carried out in a solvent such as acetonitrile or methanol, in the presence of a suitable base, e.g. potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate. Alternatively, the starting material may be reacted with an appropriate dialdehyde or diketone in the presence of a reducing agent. For example, reaction with glutardialdehyde gives a compound in which Y is piperidino. The reducing agents which may be used are those generally known for the reduction of imines, e.g. formic acid, or an alkali metal borohydride or cyanoborohydride e.g. sodium borohydride or potassium cyanoborohydride, using an alcohol such as ethanol as solvent, suitably at room termperature, preferably at pH 4 6 , or hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, e.g. palladium. The amines required as starting materials may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding azide, for example as described for process 1 . 1 Compounds of ring type a in which Y is NH2 and R10 is hydrogen may be prepared by reducing the corresponding compound in which Y represents an azido group. Compounds in which X is CH2 2 may thus be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation, using for example platinum or palladium on carbon as the catalyst.However, when compounds in which X is CH CH are required, selective reduction methods specific for the azide function should be used. Examples of suitable reagents are zinc and sodium dihydrogen phosphate in a suitable solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran zinc and methanol sulphuric acid or triphenyl phosphine followed by methanol sulphuric acid. The azido starting materials required for this reaction may be prepared by methods analogous to those for preparing the compounds of formula 2 , using reagents in which Y is azido. These methods are analogous to those of process c of BritishPatent Specification No. 2028805A. m Salts of the compounds of formula 1 may be prepared by conventional methods, e.g. by treatment with an acid or where R10 is hydrogen a base in a suitable solvent e.g. water or an organic solvent such as ether. In the preparation of compounds of formula 1 the ring hydroxy group or any other hydroxy group present will often be protected and its liberation will frequently be the last step in the preparation.Conventional methods of protection may be used, protection in the form of t butyldimethylsilyloxy or tetrahydropyranyloxy groups being preferred.
