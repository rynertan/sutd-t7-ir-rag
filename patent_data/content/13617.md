PROCESS FOR TE PREPARATION OF PENICILLIN DERIVATIVES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of certain penicillin derivatives which are useful as e lactamasc3 inhibitors. The compounds which may be prepared by the process of this invention have formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof EMI1.1 wherein R represents hydrogen, halogen, C1 6alkylthio, C1 6alkyl or alkyl substituted with phenyl, carboxy, C1 6alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy or C1 6alkylthio, and n is zero, 1 or 2. In addition certain of the compounds produced by the process of the invention are novel compounds. is known that 6ss substituted alkyl penicillanic acid derivatives may be prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding 6 substituted alkylidene penam which can be obtained via a Wittig reaction on the 6 oxo penam compound J.C. Sneehan and Y.s. Lo, J. Org. Chem. 1973, 38, 3227 A mixture of 6 a and 6 ss a hydroxyethyl penams has been prepared by reducing a 6 bromo, 6 hydroxyethyl penam with zinc silver F. DiNinno et al, T.R. Beattie, and B.G. Christensen, J. Org. Chem., 1977, 42, 2961 . Compounds of the formula I wherein R is an ethyl group have been prepared by the successive treatment of a compound wherein R is a hydroxyethyl group, with a sulphonating agent, a base and finally catalytic hydrogenation United States Patent No. 4,123,539 . Compounds of the formula I wheret n is a hydrogen atom have been preparea by the reduction of a 6,6 . dihalopenicillanate, and in particular 1,1 dioxo penicillanic acid has been stated to possess ss lactamase inhibitory qualities A.R. English et al, AntimicrobialAgents and Chemotherapy, 1978, 14, 414 . Benzyl 6ss chloropenicillanate has been reported to have been obtained in 3 yield as a by product of the preparation of benzyl 6ss hydroxypenicillanate from benzyl 6 oxopenicillanate Roets et al, J.C.S. Perkin 1, 1976, 704 , but no utility has been suggested for this compound. 6a Chloropenicillanic acids has been reported not to be an inhibitor of ss lactamase Cartwrìyht et al., Nature 278, 22 March 1979, page 360 . It is known that 6 ss hromopenicillanic acid is a ss lactamase inhibitor see Loosemore et al., J. Org. Chem., 43, 3611 1978 Pratt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., 75, 4145 1978 Knott Hunziker et al, FEBS. Betters, 59, 1979 Orlek et al., J.C.S. Chem,. Comm., 1979, 962 and Knott Hunziker et al., Biochem J., 177, 365 1979 . In these references 6 ss bromopenicillanic acid has always been described as a minor component of a mixture together with 6 a bromopenicillanic acid. The process of the present invention enables substantially pure salts of 6ss bromopenicillanic acid to be prepared Furthermore, in vivo hydrolysable esters of the 6 p halopenicillanic acids may be prepared by the present process. No such esters of 6 p halopenicillanic acids have yet been described whether pure or in admixture with the corresponding 6 a compound.These esters are advantageous because the 6 B bromopenicillanic acid tends to be unstable and is apparently readily isomerised to a mixture with the 6 a compound. It would therefore be desirable to provide a compound that released 6 B bromopenicillanic acid in vivo without significant contamination of the inactive 6 a compounds. Accordingly the present invention provides the compounds of the formula 11 EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof wherein X is a bromine or chlorine atom, and n is zero, 1 or 2, when substantially free from the corresponding 6a substituted compound. Favourably n in the compound of the formula II is zero or 2. One prefered compound of this invention is the compound of the formula III EMI4.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof. A further preferred class of compounds are the in vivo hydrolysable esters of the compound of the formula IV EMI4.2 When used herein the term substantially free from means not contaminated by more than 15 w w . More suitably the 6 ss compownd of this invention is not contaminated by more than 10 w w of the corresponding 6 a compound, favourably is not contaminated by more than 5 w w of the corresponding 6 a compound and preferably is not contaminated by more than 2 w w of the corresponding 6 a compound. The presence of any contaminating 6 a compound may be estimated by standard analytical techniques sueh as n.m.r. spectroscopy, or h.p.l.c. The compounds of the formula II are suitably in the form of the free acid. Alternatively the compounds of the formula II are in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as a metal salt, e.g. aluminium, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, and ammonium or substituted ammonium salts for example those with lower alkylamines such as triethylamine, hydroxy lower alkylamines such as 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2 hydroxyethyl amine, tris hydroxymethyl amine or tris 2 hydroxyethyl amine, cycloalkylamines such as bicyclohexylamine, or with procaine, dibenzylamine,N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, l ephenamine, N ethylpiperidine, N benzyl B phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine,N,N bis dehydroabietylethylenediamine, or bases of the pyridine type such as pyridine, collidine or quinoline, or other amines which have been used to form salts with penicillins. Favourably the compounds of the formula II are in the form of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt. Particularly favoured are the compounds of the formula II when in the form of an alkali metal salt, for example a sodium or potassium salt. From the foregoing it is to be realised that favoured compounds of this invention include alkali metal salts of 6ss bromopenicillanic acid, for example sodium 6ss bXomopenicillanate and potassium 6ss bromopenicillanate. The compounds of the formulae II IV as hereinbefore defined may be provided as in vivo hydrolysable esters. Such esters are those which hydrolysis in the human body to produce the parent acid. Suitable in vivo hydrolysable esters include those esters known to gIve in vivo hydrolysis in penicillins. Thus suitable esters include those of the sub formula a CO O CHR1 O CO R2 a wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group R2 is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group, an alkoxyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenoxyl group, or an alkoxyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group or R1 is attached to R2 to form a 1,2 diphenylene or 4,5 dimethoxy 1,2 diplienylene group. Favourably R1 is hydrogen. When R1 is hydrogen suitably R2 is selected from metal, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, tertbutyl, phenyl, benzyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propyloxyl and iso propyloxy. Preferably R2 is tert buty. Favourably R1 and R2 are joined so that the ester is a phthalidyl or 3,4 dimethoxyphthalidyl ester. Thus preferred in vivo hydrolysable ester groups include acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl a acetoxyethyl, a acetoxybenzyl, a pivaloyloxyethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxyrnethyl, a ethoxycarbonylethyl, piltilalidyl and 5 ,6 dimethoxyphthalidyl. Other suitable in vivo hydrolysable groups include dialkylamino alkyl groups such as dimethylaminomethyl, dimethylaminoethyl, diethylaminomethyl and dietbylaminoetbyl Bnd N phthalimidomethyl and methoxymethyl groups. The in vivo hydrolysable nature of the ester may be confirmed by administration to an animal such as a mouse or rat and determination of the presence of 6 B bromopenicillanate in the blood or urine of the animal. Alternatively hydrolysis in human blood or serum may be determined. The methoxymethyl ester is also of use as an intermediate for the preparation of salts of the compounds of the formula I as described hereinbelow. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester as hereinbefore defined and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition of this invention may be adopted for administration by injection or by the oral route. Generally the composition will be presented as a unit dose containing from 60 to 600 mgs. of the ss lactamase inhibitor, more suitably 100 to 500 mgs. of the ss lactamase inhibitor and preferably from 125 to 300 mgs.of the inhibitor. Such compositions may be administered 2 6 times daily and usually 3 or 4 times daily in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg human will be about 200 to 1000 mgs. The composition of this invention may be administered concurrently or consecutively with a penicillin or cephalosporin. However, it is greatly preferred to administer the penicillin or cephalosporin in the same composition as the ss lactamase inhibitor of this invention. British Patent Specification No. 1,508,978 discloses suitable penicillins and cephalosporins for use in such synergistic compositions. The forms of compositions, methods of preparation and ratios of components disclosed in Specification No. 1,508,978 may be also used with the synergists of this invention.The disclosures of Specification 1,508,978 with respect to compositions are accordingly incorporated herein by reference. A suitable penicillin is amoxycillin as the trihydrate or sodium salt. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a penicillin derivative of formula I above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, which process comprises treating a compound of formula V EMI8.1 wherein either a R is as defined with respect to formula I and Y represents isocyano or halogen, or b R is chloro and Y is arylselenyl and R represents hydrogen or a carboxyl blocking group, and n is zero 1 or 2 with a triaryl tin hydride, dialkyltin hydride or trialkyl tin hydride and thereafter optionally carrying out one or more of the following steps i converting a sulphide n O , sulphoxide n l , or sulphone n 2 to a different such group ii removing the carboxyl blocking group if present iii converting the free penicillanic acid into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof. The group Y is preferably isocyano CN , chlorine, bromine or iodine. Suitable values for the group R include chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine, methylthio, ethylthio, methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, n , sec and isobutyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, phenylpropyl, carboxymethyl, cerboxyethyl, carboxypropyl, methoxycarbonylmethy1, methoxycarbonylethyl, ethoxycarbonylmethyl, ethoxycarbonylethyl, hydroxymethyl, 1 or 2 hydroxyethyl, 1 , 2 or 3 hydroxy n propyl, 1 or 2 hydroxy isopropyl, methylthiomethyl , methylthioethyl. Suitably the hydride is a tri C6 alkyl tin hydride. When used herein the term aryl means a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by C1 3 alkyl, C13 alkoxy, hydroxy or nitro. A preferred triaryl tin hydride is triphenyl tin hydride. Another preferred reagent is tri n butyl tin hydride. When Y is arylselenyl a preferred group is phenylselenyl. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2Rx in formula V include salts and ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction, Suitable salts include tertiary amine salts, such as those with tri loweralkylamines, N ethylpiperidine, 2,6 lutidine, pyridine, N methylpyrrolidine, dimethylpiperazine. A preferred salt is with triethylamine. Suitable ester forming radicals for the group RX are esters which are compatible with the use of the tin hydrides and include benzyl1 p methoxybenzyl, 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyl, bnzoylmethyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, t butyl, t amyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, adamantyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4methylthiophenyl, tetrahydrofur 2 yl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, pentachlorophenyl, methoxymethyl, silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl or 5 butyldiphenylsilyl, trialkyltin esters or oxime ester radicals of formula N CHR where RO is aryl or heterocyclic. The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Rx group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. Preferably the reduction of this invention is carried out in the presence of a radical initiator.Suitable radical initiators include di t butyl peroxide and azobisisobutyronitri le. The reaction is generally operated in an inert solvent, such as benzene, toluene, alkanols, such as ethanol, and saturated hydrocarbons. Halogenated hydrocarbon solvents and ethers are not suitable. Once initiated, the reaction is fairly facile. However, the reaction mixture normally requires heating to about 800C before much reaction takes place. Once the reaction has started at this temperature, it is usually over within a few minutes, although it is generally preferable to heat the reaction mixture for about an hour to be certain the reaction is complete. At lower temperatures, the reaction may be initiated by using a radical initiator, or photochemically. At higher temperatures the reduction is rapid, but may be accompanied by thermal degradation of the penicillin. Although trialkyl tin hydrides have been used to remove isocyano groups in the past, for example benzyl isocyanide has been reduced to toluene with tri nbutyl tin hydride T. Saegusa et al, J.A.C.S. 1968, 90, 4182 , it has not been previously suggested that the reagents could be employed on penicillin derivatives. One major advantage of the reaction of the present invention is that it has considerable stereoselectivity and gives a great preponderance of the 68 substituted isomer of compound I . We have found that the hereinabove described reaction affords tin residues that are difficult to eliminate completely from the products of this reaction occassionally it has proved necessary to subject a reaction product to rechromatography. We have discovered that the use of an aqueous solution of a fluoride ion, for example aqueous potassium fluoride when stirred with the crude reaction product in an organic solvent such as chloroform, forms a precipitate which may readily be filtered to provide a filtrate containing crude reaction product essentially free of tin residual impurities. This modification has been found only to be an improvement in the process described hereinabove when Y is a halogen atom in the compounds of the formula V . The compound I resulting after this reduction process may be a sulphide n O , sulphoxide , n l or sulphone n 2 at the l position. After the reduction these groups may if desired, be converted to a different such group by standard methods of reduction or oxidation. The intermediate of formula V wherein represents isocyano may be prepared as described inU.S. Patent No. 3,996,235. The intermediates of formula V wherein Y represents halogen may be prepared as described in J. Chem. Soc. C 1969, 2123 J. Org.Chem., 1977, 42, 2961 and J. Org. Chem., 1978, 43, 2203. The intermediates of formula V wherein Y is arylselenyl and R is chloro may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula VI EMI12.1 wherein n is defined in relation to formula v , and RX is a carboxy blocking ester as defined in relation to formula V , with an arylselenyl chloride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane at an ambient temperature. Compounds of the formula VI may be prepared by the methods ofJ. Org. Chem., 1974, 39, 1444. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of an in vivo hydrolysable ester of 6 B bromopenicillanic acid when substantially free from the corresponding in vivo hydrolysable ester of 6 a bromopenicillanic acid which process comprises preparing a mixture of isomeric in vivo hydrolysable esters of 6a and 6ss bromopenicillanic acids and thereafter chromatographically separating the mixture of isomers into fractions and recovering the in vivo hydrolysable ester of 6 B bromopenicillanic acid from a fraction containing sad in vivo hydrolysable ester of 6 ss bromopenicillanic acid substantially free from the in vivo hydrolysable ester of a 6 a bromopenicillanic acid. The mixture of isomer in vivo hydrolysable esters may be prepared by reaction of a mixture of the salts with a reactive halide or the like, for example, with a compound of the formula VII X CHR1 O CO R2 VII wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined in relation to sub formula a and X is C1, Br or I. Esterification to afford the dialkylaminoalkyl, N phthalimidomethyl or methoxymethyl esters is similarly performed, for example using dialkylaminoalkyl halides, N chloromethyl phthalimide or chloromethyl methyl ether respectively. Alternatively the mixture of isomeric in vivo hydrolysable esters of 6a and 6ss bromopenicillanic acid may be prepared by the treatment of an in vivo hydrolysable ester of 6,6 dibromopenicillanic acid with a strong organic base such as methyl lithium followed by protonation. Protonation is most conveniently effected by acetic acid The treatment with base is carried out in anhydrous conditions at a low temperature, for example under nitrogen in a dry solvent at 78 C. In vivo hydrolysable esters of 6,6 dibromopenicillanic acid are prepared by conventional methods of esterification. Such esterifiaction reactions to prepare a mixture of isomeric in vivo hydrolysable esters of 6a and 66 bromopenicillanic acids will be carried out under conditions similar to those known to be suitable for the preparation of in vivo hydrolysable esters of penicillins.for example the reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, optionally together with methylene chloride. The salt of the mixture of 6 bromopenicill2nic acids may be generated in situ, for example by using an organic tertiary base such as trimethylamine or triethylamine. Since known mixtures of 6 bromopenicillanic acids contain only a minor proportion usually about 12 w w .of the desired 6 ss bromo isomer, the resulting mixture of in vivo hydrolysable esters only contains a minor proportion of the desired 6 ss bromo isomer. As will be appreciated by the skilled chemist obtaining a, reactive minor component from a mixture of materials is difficult and not necessarily possible. Fortunately it has been found that repeated chromatography of the mixture of in vivo hydrolysable esters can produce the desired in vivo hydrolysable ester 6 B bromo homer substantially free from the corresponding in vivo hydrolysable ester of the 6 a bromo isomer. Suitable methods of chromatography include column chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase.Gradient elution using ethyl acetate cyclohexane mixtures has been found suitable. The progress of the individual product through the chromatographic system may be monitored by thin layer chromatography and developing with Ehrlichss reagent. The initial major product is the 6 a isomer and the initial minor product is the 6 ss isomer so that Rf values and relative positions may be known. Initial separation of the two isomers is not good so that the leading edge of the faster running component or the trailing edge of the slower running component is selected for rechromatography. Two or three repetitions of this chromatographic process are normally sufficient to produce the desired substantially pure product. In the silica gel ethyl acetate cyclohexane system described in Example 22 herein the 6 ss isomer is the slower running component so that the trailing edge of the slower running component is selected for rechromatography. The 6a, ss starting material may be obtained as described in the Loosemore et al., reference referred to hereinbefore. The following Examples illustrate the processes of this invention When referring to the Examples the following should be noted Thin layer chromatography t.l.c was carried out on Merck Kieselgel platens containing F254, and was used for assessment of purity and for following the progress of reactions. The eluant used was usually ethyl acetate 15 100 in light petroleum redistilled b.p. 60 700C , and plates were visualized by uv, aqueous potassium permanganate or iodine vapour.Column chromatography using similar solvent mixtures was carried out on Hopkin and Williams Silica gel MFC without binder . Toluene p sulphonates were converted to their free bases by washing a suspension of the salt in chilled ethyl acetate with a several fold excess of aqueous sodium bicarbonate and drying. Unless otherwise stated, all optical rotations were determined for solutions in chloroform, i.r.spectra as thin films and n.m.r s as solutions in deuteriochloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal standard and were determined at 90 MHz. Melting points are uncorrected DMF is N,N dimethylformamide, ether refers to diethyl ether, EtOAc is ethyl acetate, MIBK is methyl iso butyl ketone 3 methylpentan 2 one , andTHE is tetrahydrofuran. ABIBN and SEH are respectively azo bis isobutyronitrile and sodium ethyl hexanoate used as a 2,molar solution in MIBK .
