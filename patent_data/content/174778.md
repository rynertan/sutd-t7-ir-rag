# Apparatus for individually processing optical images of different Wavelengths.

## Abstract
A telecine projector comprises a light source 20 illumi nating film 29. An objective lens 30 focuses light passing through the film. The light is divided by a prism block 32 and falls onto sensors 34 sensing blue, green, red and infra red wavelengths, and positioned so that the image size is equal at each sensor. Light from the source 20 is divided by a dichroic mirror 36 before reaching the film 29. Visible light passes through the mirror 36 and a similarly coated mirror 38. Infra red light takes the path 37b before being recombined with the visible light by the mirror 38. An aperture stop 40 reduces the diameter of the cone of infra red light entering the lens 30, thereby reducing the effective aperture of the lens for infra red light only. The depth of field of the infra red image is thereby increased, bringing it into focus at the infra red sensor 34 and compensating for unequal lens performance across the wide spectrum in use.

## Description
APPARATUS FOR INDIVIDUALLY PROCESSING OPTICAL IMAGES OF DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS The present invention relates to apparatus for individually processing optical images of different wavelength ranges, comprising an objective lens, means for splitting light passed by the objective lens into a plurality of beams containing the different wavelength ranges respectively, and separate image receptors for the beams respectively. The invention may be used, for instance, in conjunction with telecine apparatus. The design of a lens or other optical component becomes, in general, more difficult the wider the spectrum of light which the lens must focus. This spectrum is referred to herein as the working spectrum of the lens. A very wide working spectrum is used in telecine projectors which convert images on cinematographic film into video signals. The spectrum may range from about 400mm blue to about 900mm near infra red . A telecine projector comprises a film gate through which the film is fed, a light source illuminating film in the film gate and an objective lens system focusing an image of the illuminated film onto an array of sensors, for instance CCD sensors. The light is split by a prism block into blue, green, red and infra red beams before reaching the sensors, each beam falling on a different sensor array. Electronic circuitry associated with each sensor array combines the signals from the sensors representing the red, blue and green components of the picture, to form a standard video signal.The infra red image is used to detect scratches and dirt on the film. Since colour film dyes are transparent to infra red light, the infra red image should be uniform across the field. Any lack of uniformity indicates a scratch or speck of dirt,wbich do not transmit inf ra red light. The infra red image is used to control further processing of the video sigial so that actatcnes and dirt are not shown in the television picture. The performance requirements placed on the objective lens of a telecine projector are severe. The image size must be constant at each of the four sensors to within about 0.3X. This can be achieved by appropriate positioning of the sensors along the light path. However, the four images are also required to be sufficiently well focused at the sensors including the infra red sensor that the resultant television picture appears sharp. The wide working spectrum and the extremely large objective lens aperture required typically N.A. 0.15 make the simultaneous achievement of sharp focus and equal image size very difficult to obtain. Indeed, at one stage in our research, we were led to believe that achieving satisfactory results in both respects was not possible. Apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that it comprises means providing a reduced effective aperture for the objective lens in respect of one or more but not all of the different wavelength ranges. The means for providing a reduced effective aperture may comprise an aperture stop made of a material opaque to one or more but not all of the wavelengths, but preferably comprises second means for splitting light into a plurality of beams containing the different wavelengths respectively, means in the path of one or more but not all of the plurality of beams for processing that or those beams to reduce the effective aperture of the lens, and means for recombining the beams. Further features of the invention are detailed in the appended claims to which reference should now be made. As will be appreciated from the description below, the invention enables the construction of an improved telecine projector, in which the objective lens has a smaller effective aperture for infra red light than for visible light. Accordingly, the sensors may be positioned to receive equal image sizes, and the objective set for optimum focus of visible light at the red, green and blue sensors, whereupon the infra red sensor, although not at the theoretical infra red focal plane of the lens, receives a satisfactorily sharp picture by virtue of the increased depth of field of the infra rvd image. Throughout t92 document the term lens is used to mean not only a single, simple lens, but also a compound lens and a system of simple or compound lenses. The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the drawings which show examples of apparatus embodying the invention and in which Figure la is a section through a simple two element lens system which individually processes images of different wavelengths Figure lb shows the aperture stop of the system of Figure la and Figure 2 is a schematic view of a telecine projector embodying the invention. Figure la shows a simple two element lens 10. An aperture stop 12 is positioned between the two elements 14 of the lens 10.The aperture stop 12 comprises a disc 16 of material transparent across the working spectrum. The disc is coated in an annular region 18 with a dichroic material which is opaque to a part only of the working spectrum. The annulus is centred on the light transmission axis of the lens 10. For instance, the coating may be transparent to all but the infra red component of a beam passing through the lens 10.The stop 12 accordingly provides a reduced effective aperture of the lens for part of the spectrum with respect to the effective aperture of the lens for the remainder of the spectrum, since infra red light sees an aperture of the inner diameter of the annular region 18, while the remainder of the spectrum is unaffected by the dichroic coating and . sees an aperture of the outer diameter of the elements 14, that is, the outer diameter of the annular region 18. It is well known that the depth of field in which an image can be considered sharply in focus increases with decreasing aperture size. Therefore, the depth of field for an infra red image formed by the lens 10 is greater than the depth of field of images at other wavelengths. An objective lens system of a telecine camera, incorporating a lens like the lens 10, can be adjusted to provide a well focused image at visible wavelengths and having a desired image size. The infra red sensor may be positioned to detect an infrared image of the same size. Although the sensor may need to be at a position other than the theoretical infrs red image plane, adequately sharp focusing at the sensor arises from the increased depth of field for infra red. The television image resulting from the projector is thereby improved, since equality of image size and sharp focus are both provided. The reduced aperture for infra red results in an infra red image of reduced brightness. This is not detrimental to the final television picture for several reasons. Firstly, the light sources commonly used in telecine projectors emit more strongly at infra red wavelengths than at visible wavelengths. Secondly, CCD sensors are more sensitive to infra red light than they are to visible light.Finally, the infra red image is only required to be sufficiently bright to allow the sensor to discriminate between areas of film which do and do not transmit infra red, that is, between unblemished and blemished areas. Otherwise, the absolute brightness of the infra red image is not important. The lens 10 is uncomplicated but does present some problems in some circumstances. Films may vary considerably in their density, that is their light transmissivity. Variable density filtering is often needed between the light source and the film to compensate for this, so that the television image is of constant brightness, regardless of film density. Such filtering used in conjunction with the lens 10 would result in a varying brightness infra red image. The threshold brightness at which the sensor is triggered to detect a blemish would consequently have to be moved in sympathy with changes in the filter density. This would lead to undesirable complication in the processing of the sensor outputs. Figure 2 shows schematically a telecine projector which overcomes this problem, and provides a constant brightness infra red image regardless of film density. A light source 20 and lens 22 generate a light beam 24 which enters optical apparatus 26, which will be described in more detail later. The beam 28 leaving the apparatus 26 illuminates film 29, which is fed through a film gate 29 . An objective lens 30 focuses light passing through the film 29. A prism block 32 splits the focused beam into its blue, green, red and infra red components, which arrive at respective sensor arrays 34. The beam 24 contains light with wavelengths ranging from about 400mm to about 900mm. Within the apparatus 26, a dichroic coated mirror 36 transmits light with a wavelength below about 650mm substantially all the visible light as a beam 37a, and reflects the rest of the light in the beam 24 substantially only infra red light as a beam 37b. The visible beam 37a passes, undeflected, to a second dichroiccoated mirror 38, coated with the same coating as the mirror 36.The infra red beam 37b is directed to the mirror 38 by two fully reflecting mirrors 39. The mirror 38 transmits the visible beam 37a and reflects the infra red beam 37b thereby recombining the beams as a single beam 28. An aperture stop 40 is positioned at or near the point at which an image of the filament of the light source 20 is formed by the lens 22. The stop 40 reduces the diameter of the cone of infra red light which is recombined with the visible light by the mirror 38 and enters the objective lens 30. The reduction in diameter serves to reduce the effective aperture of the objective 30 for infra red light, so as to provide an increased depth of field for infra red, and hence the increased performance already described above with reference to Figures la and lb. Briefly, the objective lens is set to provide a sharply focused image at visible wavelengths at the sensors 34, which are positioned including the infra red sensor to give an image of equal size. Satisfactorily sharp focus of the infra red image is ensured by the reduced effective aperture of the objective lens for infra red light. Other lenses may be provided in the apparatus 26, for instance to compensate for the difference in path length of the visible and infra red beams 37a, 37b. A filter 42 may also be used in the beam 37b to further reduce the width of the spectrum of the beam. In order to compensate for different film densities, a variable density filter not shown may be put in the path of the visible beam 37a. The brightness of the visible image can then be controlled while the infra red image is entirely unaffected, so that the trigger level of the infra red sensor can remain constant.
