## Description
NAPHTHOQUNONE DERIVATIVESThe present invention relates to naphthoquinones and their use in chemotherapy.More specifically the invention is concerned with certain 2 substituted 3 hydroxy1,4 naphthoquinones, the preparation thereof, formulations thereof and the use thereof in the chemotherapy of human and animal protozoal infections. 2Substituted 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones have previously been described in the art as possessing antiprotozoal activity, in particular antimalarial and, to a lessee extent, anticoccidial activity. Thus Fieser et al. 3. Amer. Chem. Soc.1948, 70, 3156 disclosed some hundreds of such compounds as possessing antimalarial activity. A number of these, in which a cycloalkyl group was attached to the quinone nucleus, were considered particularly active and were described inU.S. Patent No. 2,553,648. A number of compounds were administered to man, but these suffered from the disadvantage that large doses were required to achieve an effect. Subsequently attention shifted to compounds having an c cyclohexyl alkyl side chain, in particular menoctone, 2 8 cyclohexyloctyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone eg. Fieser et. al. J.Med. Chem. 1967,10, 513 but again interest waned because of poor activity in man.U.S. Patent 3,347,742 taught the use of 2 4 cyclohexylcyclohexyl 1,4 naphtho quinone as an anticoccidial agent but this compound has never achieved practical use.British Patent Specification No. 1553424 describes 2 hydroxy 3 cyclohexylalkyl and 2 hydroxy 3 cyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoquinone derivatives as effective for the prevention and treatment of theileriosis. European Patent Specification No.0002228 refers, inter alia to 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones in which the substituent in the 2 position is a C3 12cycloalkyl ring optionally substituted by aC1 4alkyl group, in particular a methyl group. However, no such compounds substituted are disclosed, nor is there any indication of which positions of the cycloalkyl ring are to be substituted.It has cow been found that certain novel substituted naphthoquinones as described below exhibit very high activity against one or more protozoa. Thus certain of the compounds exhibit a much higher activity against the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum than related compounds previously considered as candidate antimalarial agents. In addition these compounds exhibit good, broad spectrum activity against commercially important Eimeria species, the causative organisms of coccidiosis.Other of the compounds exhibit a very good activity against theilerial parasites and are notable for their activity against both T.parvum and T.armulata, exhibiting a higher activity than naphthoquinones previously noted as anti theilerial agents.The invention accordingly provides, in a first aspect, compounds of formula I and physiologically acceptable salts thereof.EMI2.1 wherein either R1 is hydrogen and R2 is selected from C16 alkoxy, aralkoxy, C1 6alkyl C1 6alkoxy, phenyl substituted by one or two groups selected from halogen and Cl alkyl, halogen and perhalo Cl 6 alkyl orR1 and R2 are both C16 alkyl or phenyl and n is 0 or 1.Since the hydroxyl group in the compounds of formula I may form salts with appropriate bases, physiologically acceptable salts include those formed with an alkali metal cation, such as sodium or potassium, and those with organic bases such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine and N methyl glutamine.The compounds of formula I may exist in a tautomeric form in which the hydroxyl group donates its protons to one of the oxo groups, and such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of this invention. However, it is believed that the form shown in formula I is the stable form. It should be noted that In the unsubstituted 1,4 naphthoquinone ring the 2 a i t positions are identical and thus, In the naming of the compounds, convention will indicate whether the cyclohexyl substituent or the hydroxyl group is in the 2position. For convenience, throughout this specification when the compounds are referred to non specifically, the substituent is defined as in the 2 position.It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen may exist as cis or trans isomers, that is to say that the cyclohexyl ring may be cis or trans substituted by the naphthoquinone nucleus and the group R2. The invention includes both cis and trans isomers and mixtures thereof in any ratio. In general when the compound is in the form of a mixture of isomers the trans isomer will be present in an amount of about 50 or will be the predominant isomer but mixtures in which the cis isomer predominates are also included within the scope of the invention. The specific ratio of isomers may be varied as required typical mixtures include those in which the cis trans isomer ratio is about 1 1, 40 60 and 5 9 Within the scope of formula I are compounds of formula IA EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above.The compounds of formula IA are of particular interest as antimalarial agents and anticoccidial agents.Also within the scope of formula I are compounds of formula IB EMI3.2 where R1 and R2 are as defined aboveCompounds of formula 1B are of particular interest as antitheilerial agents.Compounds of formula IB are also of value as intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula IA above.Within the compounds of formula preferred compounds include those wherein a R1 is hydrogen and R2 is i C16 alkoxy, for example methoxy, n butoxy and t butoxy ii aralkoxy, wherein the alkyl moiety has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example benzyloxy the aryl moiety, e.g. phenyl, may optionally bear one or more substituents, for example halogen eg ehlorine iii C1 6 alky C1 6 alkoxy wherein the alkyl moiety is straight or branched, for example methylene, isopropylene and the alkoxy moiety is straight chain, for example methoxy iv phenyl bearing one or two substituents selected from halogen, e.g. chlorine, and C16 alkyl, e.g. methyl, preferably in the 3 and or 4 position s v halogen, for example fluoro vi perfluoro C16 alkyl, for example trifluoromethyl.Specific compounds included within the scope of formula I include 2 hydroxy 3 4 methoxycyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 hydroxy 3 C4 1 methoxy 1 methylethyl cyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoqui none 2 C4 benzyloxycyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2,4 4 chlorophenyl cyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2,4 3,4 dichlorophenyl cyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 C4 3,4 dimethylphenyl cyclohexyD 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4 fluorocyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1s4 naphthoqui none 2 hydroxy 3 4 trifluoromethylcyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4 n butoxycyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4 t butoxycyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthOquinone 2 4,4 dimethylcyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4,4.diethylcyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4,4 di henylcyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 4,4 di n propylcyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone and 2 t4 4 chlorophenoxymethyl cyclohexyD 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone. According to a further feature of the present invention we provide compounds of formula I as defined above and physiologically acceptable salts thereof for use as therapeutic agents, for example, for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of a protozoal disease in an animal, e.g. man.According to a further feature of the present invention we provide a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a protozoal disease in an animal which comprises administering to the animal an anti protozoal amount of a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.The compounds of formula IA have been found to be extremely active against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and are thus of use in the treatment and or prophylaxis of malaria in man. The compounds of formula IA have also been found to be extremely active against protozoa causing the commercially important forms of coccidiosis, in particular Eimeria tenella and E.acervulina and are thus of use in the treatment or prophylaxis of coccidiosis in animals, particularly birds.It will be appreciated that the amcunt of compound of formula IA required for use in treatment or prophylaxis will vary not only with the active compound but also with the route of administration and nature of the infection or condition. In general a suitable dose for a mammal including man for treatment, for example of malaria, will lie in the range of 0.1 mg to 200 mg per kilogram bodyweight per day, with a preferred range of 1 mg to 100 mg kg, particularly lOmg to 40 mg kg.For the prophylaxis or treatment uf coccidiosis the compound will normally be administered ad lib in drinking water or diet and suitable levels of drug will be in the range of 1 to 500ppm, preferably 10 4OOppm, ideally about 200ppm.The compounds of formula IB have been found to be extremely active against protozoa of the genus Theileria, and are thus of use in the treatment and or prophylaxis of theileriosis in cattle and sheep. In particular the compounds have been found to be active against infection by T.annulata or T.parva. It will be appreciated that the amount of compound of formula IB required for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of theilerial infections will vary not only with the active compound, but also with the route of administration and nature of the infection The effective amount, dosage or uriwt desage as used herein is denoted to mean a predetermined amount of the compound which is sufficiently effective against protozoal organisms, for instance in cattle or sheep when administered in vivo. To contribute to or achieve prophylaxis or cure, some preparations may contain multiples of the dosage required by a single animal.A typical initial dose for cattle weighing 400 kg may be 0.2 to 10 g conveniently 0.5 to 2.5 g, and for calves or sheep 50 mg to 1.0 g, or preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 gramme of the active compound, but further dosages may be given.The compounds of formula Cl are preferably presented as a therapeutic pharmaceutical or veterinary formulation.Therapeutic formulations comprise at least one compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic andlor prophylactic ingredients. The carriers must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formula and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.The active compound s may conveniently be presented as a pharmaceutical formulation in unit dosage form. A convenient unit dose formulation contains the active ingredient compoundis in an amount of from 10 mg to 1 g. Therapeutic formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral including intramuscular and intravenous administration, although oral is the preferred route. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers of both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.Therapeutic formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding an inert liquid diluent. Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may optionally be scored.Capsules may be prepared by filling the active compound, either alone or in admixture with one or more accessory ingredients, into the capsule cases and then sealing them in the usual manner. Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein the active ingredient together with any accessory ingredient s is sealed in a rice paper envelope. Therapeutic formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a liquid may be presented as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid, or as an oil in water or water in oil liquid emulsion. Therapeutic formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier s followed by chilling and shaping moulds.Therapeutic formulations suitable for parenteral administration include sterile solutions or suspensions of the active compound in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles.Such preparations are conveniently presented in unit dose or multi dose containers which are sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like, and substances included for the purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient.The therapeutic formulations for veterinary use, in particular for coccidiosis, may conveniently be in either powder or liquid concentrate form. In accordance with standard veterinary formulation practice, conventional water soluble excipients, such as lactose or sucrose, may be incorporated in the powders to improve their physical properties. Thus particularly suitable powders of this invention comprise 50 to 100 w w, and preferably 60 to 80 wlw of the active ingredient s , and 0 to 50 w w and preferably 20 to 40 w w of conventional veterinary excipients.These powders may either be added to animal feedstuffs, for example by way of an intermediate premix, or diluted in animal drinking water.Liquid concentrates of this invention suitably contain a water soluble compound of formula I or a salt thereof and may optionally include a veterinarily acceptable water miscible solvent, for example polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, glycerol formal or such a solvent mixed with up to 30 v v of ethanol.The liquid concentrates may be administered to the drinking water of animals, particularly poultry.The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example other antiprotozoal agents. In particular the compounds of the invention may be employed together with known antimalarial, anticoccidial and or antitheilerial agents.The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula I as defined herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with another therapeutically active agent, in particular an antimalarial or anticoccidial agent. The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor comprise a further aspect of the invention.The combinations defined above, in particular when a second antimalarial or anticoccidial agent is employed, are of value inter alia in delaying the onset of resistance to the compounds of formula I .Suitable therapeutic agents for use in the mixtures defined above include, for example, pyrimethamine, chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, primaquine, monensin, halofuginone, arprinocid and zoalene.When compounds of formula I are used in combination with a second therapeutic agent effective against the same parasites the dose of each compound will vary from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses may be readily determined by those skilled in the art.The compounds of formula I may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. using processes described in the literature.According to a further feature of the present invention we provide a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I and physiologically acceptable salts thereof which comprises a hydrolysing the corresponding 3 X substituted compound wherein X represents a group which is hydrolysable to a hydroxy group or the corresponding 2,3 epoxide b oxidising a compound of formula II EMI9.1 wherein n, R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined c reacting a compound of formula CU EMI10.1 wherein Y represents a hydroxy group or a group hydrolysable thereto with a donor compound providing the R1 and R2 substituted cyclohexyl or cyclohexylmethyl residue wherein R and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and when Y represents a hydrolysable group hydrolysing the said group to a hydroxy group d converting a compound of formula a wherein n is 1 to a corresponding compound of formula I therein n is 0 by Hooker oxidation and optionally converting a resulting compound of formula I into a physiologically acceptable salt thereof e converting a compound of formula CV EMI10.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined previously, to a compound of formula IB by reduction of the oxomethyl group, e.g. by hydrogenation especially under pressure and in the presence of a catalyst, for example a copper chromite catalyst. With regard to process a , compounds of formula I may be prepared by, for example, converting the corresponding 3 halogeno, e.g. 3 chloro or 3 bromo, analogues of formula V EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2 and n are as defined in formula I and X is halogen, into the corresponding 3 hydroxy compound by alkaline hydrolysis, for example with an alkali metal hydroxide in a suitable medium, for instance potassium hydroxide in aqueous methanolic medium has been found convenient.The compounds of formula V above are novel compounds and thus provide a further aspect of the invention. The compounds of formula II may be prepared by methods known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure, for example the method described by Fieser, L., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1948, 3165 et seq.Other hydrolysable groups which may be present in the 3 position of the starting materials include acyloxy groups, e.g. C1 4alkanoyloxy groups such as acetoxy, or aroyl groups such as benozyloxy and C1 6alkoxy groups such as methoxy.Also with regard to process a , the 2,3 epoxide of formula VI EMI11.2 may be hydrolysed to a compound of formula I for example with dilute aqueous acid or dilute aqueous base.The compounds of formula V and VI above may be prepared for example by halogenation or expoxidation respectively in conventional manner of a compound of formulaEMI12.1 wherein n, R1 and R2 are as defined hereinabove .Compounds of formula VII may also be subjected to a Thiele acetylation by reaction with an appropriate acetylating agent eg acetic anhydride in the presence of an oxidising agent eg perchloric acid to provide compounds of formula IIa . Compounds of formula IIa may be converted to compounds of formula IIb by hydrolysis which compounds may be converted to compounds of formula I by oxidation in accordance with process b , eg by a method analogous to that described in Organic Reactions, Vol 19, p.222. Suitable oxidising agents include, for example, ferric chloride and a mineraI acid or chromic acid.EMI12.2 a R1 COCH3 b R1 H In process c the hydrolysable group Y in formula m may be a group as defined for X in process a above, for example halo, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a hydroxy, acetoxy or C1 6alkoxy group The donor compound in process c Is generally a compound which is capa6Ie oR providing the substituted cyclohexyl or cyclohexylmethyl group as a free radical with the electron In the correct position vis a vis the t alkyl substituent either spontaneously or under oxidising conditions.A suitable donor compound is the corresponding cycloalkane carboxylic acid which may undergo oxidative decarboxylation. For instance persulphate with a catalyst, such as silver ions, is convenient for the purpose, c.f.Jacobson, N., et al.,Annalen, 1972, 763, 135 and Acta Chem. Scand, 1973,27, 3211 . Preferably, when persulphate is used under these conditions, the reaction is carried out with a 1,4 naphthoquinone in which Y is other than hydroxy. Conveniently ammonium persulphate can be used as the oxidising agent, and the catalyst is silver nitrate.Hydrolysis subsequent to the main coupling reaction may, if required, provide the hydroxy group. Alkaline conditions are usually preferred for the hydrolysis.An example ofthe donor itself carrying a peroxide grouping is the method employing an appropriately substituted cycloalkanoyl peroxide as suggested by U.S.Patent No. 2,553,647.The provision of the cycloalkyl free radical by a spontaneous release from the donor can, for instance, be achieved by the use of a tricycloalkylborane. Such reagent can easily be prepared by reacting the cycloalkene with borane dimethylsulphide. Conveniently the reaction is carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.Other possible cyclohexyl or cyclohexylmethyl donors include appropriately substituted cyclohexenyl or cyclohexenylmethyl carboxylic acids. In such cases the resulting condensate will additionally require reduction to provide a compound of formula I .It will be appreciated to those skilled in the art that the processes described herein may lead either to isomeric mixtures cis and trans of the compounds of formula I , or, where isomerically pure starting material is employed, to pure cis or trans compounds of formula I . It has been found that the non stereospecific preparative methods generally lead to an approximately 1 1 ratio of the cis and trans isomers, the amount of trans isomer in the recovered product may be increased by adjustment of reaction conditions, in particular by selection of a solvent system in which the trans isomer is less soluble.Such solvent systems may be readily determined by experiment but a solvent system found to be particularly effective Is a mixture of water and acetonitrile.By use of such systems cis to trans ratios of from about 2 3 to about 1 4 may be obtained.Where a single isomer, cis or trans, is desired this may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis, eg by Honked Oxidation as described above. or by separation of the isomers by physical means. Such methods are well known in the art and include, for example, fractional crystallisation or chromatographic separation.With regard to process d , the compounds according to formula IA may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula IB by Hooker oxidation as described for example in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1948, 3174 or 3215.The present invention also includes bioprecursors for the compounds of formula I above e.g. compounds of formulaEMI14.1 wherein R1, R2 and n are as defined in formula I above and y1 is a halogeno, acetoxy, benzoyloxy or C1 6alkoxy group. These are novel compounds and are useful as intermediates in the syntheses described above. Those which carry a group for y1 which is easily hydrolysed in vivo into the hydroxy group, may be used as pro drugs in formulations or for treatment to provide the hydrolysis endproduct in situ The acetyl or benzoyl group may undergo such hydrolysis and thus these bioprecursors are of potential as long acting precursors of active compounds. The following examples illustrate the Invention Example 1 2 Hydroxy 3 4 methoxycyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoguinone A mixture of 2 chloro 1,4 naphthoquinone 1.16 g , 4 methoxycyclohexane 1carboxylic acid 1.3 g and silver nitrate 0.3 g were stirred at 650C in a mixture of acetonitrile 2.5 ml , sulpholane 7.5 ml and water 17.5 ml while a solution of ammonium persulphate 2.3 g in water 5 ml was added dropwise during 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for a further 15 minutes at 650C, cooled in ice and extracted with ether.

The reaction mixture was then refluxed for a further 30 minutes, concentrated hydrochloric acid 5 ml added dropwise and the mixture cooled in ice. Addition of an equal volume of water precipitated an oil which slowly turned to a semi solid. Recrystallisation from acetonitrile yielded 2 hydroxy 3 4 methoxycyclohexyl 1,4 naphthoquinone, m.p. 152 155 , shown by n.m.r to be the pure trans isomer.

The mixture was washed thoroughly with sodium bicarbonate solution, dried and evaporated to a mixture of oil and solid.Ether was added to dissolve most of the material and the solids removed by filtration. The ethereal filtrate was evaporated and the residue distilled b.p. 76 800C 0.4 mm Hg to give a partially crystalline product. The solid, m.p. 95 1120C, was separated from the oil by filtration and proved to be a poIymer of isobu tene. The filtrate was ethyl 4 t butoxycycloh xane l carboxylate. The ethyl 4 t butoxycyclohexane 1 carboxylate 1 q , thus obtained, was heated on a steam bath with 2M sodium hydroxide solution 10 ml to which had been added ethanol 2 ml . After about 4 hours a homogenous solution had formed. The reaction mixture was washed with petroleum ether 60 80 and the aqueous phase acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. An oil separated which crystallised on cooling and scratching. The solid was collected and recrystallised from petroleum ether 60 80 to yield 4 t butoxycyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid, m.pt. 100 1050C. F. Preparation of 4,4 fliphenylcyclohexane 1 carboxyllc Acid 4,4 Diphenylcyclohexan 1 one 1.25 g was suspended in acetic acid 2 ml and stirred at OOC, while a solution of sodium cyanide 0.7 g in water 2 ml was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight and then partitioned between chloroform and water. The organic layer was separated, washed with water, dried using MgSO4 , evaporated to dryness and the oil so obtained triturated with cold toluene. The white solid obtained was collected, washed with cold toluene and petroleum ether 40 60 and dried.The above product 10.73 g was dissolved in dry pyridine 9.75 ml and dry benzene 9.75 ml , stirred at 0 C and a solution of phosphorylchloride 12.7 mi in pyridine 11.7 ml added dropwise over 45 minutes. The mixture was slowly warmed to reflux during 45 minutes and then refluxed for a further 30 minutes. The hot solution was poured carefully onto crushed ice 200 ml with stirring which was continued for 30 minutes. The mixture was extracted with chloroform 2 x 100 ml , the organic extracts washed with water, dried using MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness to give a yellow solid.The nitrile 9.0 g , potassium hydroxide 6.4 g , ethanol 8.0 ml and water 10 ml were refluxed for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and diluted with water 200 ml . The white solid which formed was extracted with ethyl acetate 2 x 200 ml , the organic extracts washed with water and then extracted with 1M sodium hydroxide 200 ml .The aqueous extract was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the white precipitate collected, washed with water, dried and recrystallised from ethanol to give 4,4 diphenylcyclohex 1 ene 1.carboxylic acid m.p. 227 2290C . The acid 4.5 g was dissolved in ethanol 200 ml and catalyst 10 Pd C, 0.45 g added under nitrogen. The mixture was hydrogenated at 500C 4 atm. for 5 hours.The catalyst was removed and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to give 4 4 diphenylcyclohexane l carboxylic acid, m.p. 191 192 C.Similarly prepared were 4,4 dimethylcyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid, m.p. 39 420C 4,4 diethylcyclohexane l carboxylic acid, m.p. 44 46 C 4,4 di n propylcyclohexane l carboxylic acid, m.p. 98 102 CExample 17A Activity of 2 substituted cycIohexyl 3 hydroxynaphthoquinones against Plasmodium falciparum in vitroCompounds of formula IA , as hereinbefore described, were examined for their inhibitory effect on Plasmodium falciparum in vitro.The test method was a modification of that described by Desjardins et al.,Antimicrob. Agents and Chemotherapy,1979,16,710 718. Compounds were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 1000mg L and dilutions down to lmg L were made. The drug solutions were serially diluted using RPMI 1640 medium 10 human plasma in microtitration plates. Parasitised and fresh red blood cells were added, together with hypoxanthine, in RPMI 1640 medium 10 human plasma and the cultures incubated for 36 hours. Cultures were then harvested, the particulate contents collected on a glass fibre filter paper and washed copiously with water. The filter papers were dried and the radioactivity measured using a scintillation counter. Infected untreated and uninfected untreated cultures were included as controls.The results are shown in Table I.Example 17B. Activity of 2 substituted cyclohexyl 3 hydroxynaphthoquinones against P.yoelii in vivoThe naphthoquinone was suspended in 0.25 w v celacol in water by milling for 16 24 hours at 260C. The suspensions were subsequently serially diluted with 5.25 w v celacol in water. At time 0, 0.1 ml of a suspension of 107 P.yselii parasitised red blood ceIls mI of phosphate saline were injected intravenously into 15 20 g mice through a tail vein.Groups of 5 mice per treatment were dosed orally at times 6, 22, 30, 46, 54, 70 and 78 hours with 0.2 ml of the drug suspension. Tail blood smears were taken at 96 hours, stained with Giemsa and the percentage of red blood cells infected determined and compared to untreated, infected controls. Percent inhibition was correllated with dose to provide ED50 values. The results are shown in Table IA below.
