# Ld Steel converter having a refractory lining containing a gas transmitting bottom element.

## Abstract
A gas transmitting wall element for a metallurgical vessel having a refractory lining is described which is subject to low wear, is reproducible and makes unnecessary con tinuous blowing of gas through it. The element has an outer sheet metal box 1 , open at one end, and a refractory filling 2 in the box comprising at least one brick spaced from the closed end 4 of the box, into which a gas inlet 3 opens. The brick contacts the metal sidewalls of the box and has grooves 7 to allow the gas to pass to the open end of the box.
