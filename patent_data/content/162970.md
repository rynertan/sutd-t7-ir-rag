# Multiple memory loading system.

## Abstract
Multiple memory loading system with a plurality of intercoupled modules TCEA B TCEL n including memories and processing means and at least one TCEA B of which is able to transmit each GLS1 of a plurality of data packets GLS1 m to the memories of a number of modules wherein said data packet may then be stored. The transmission of each GLS1 of said data packets GLS1 m from said one module TCEA B only occurs directly to the memories of a number of predetermined modules TCE1, 14, 27, 40 of an initial set TCE1 50 and indirectly from said memories to memories of other modules.
