# Speed detection apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a method and apparatus for providing speed information based on position pulses from a position detector for the purpose of controlling the speed of a motor. The invention includes means receiving the position pulses as an input thereto for counting the number thereof within a fixed period To, means for measuring an interval T1 between a position pulse generated just prior to the fixed period To and an instant at which the period begins, and means for measuring an interval T2 between a final position pulse generated in the period To and an instant at which the period ends. The operation T To T1 T2 is performed to obtain the time T required for entry of the position pulses, the time T is divided by the number of pulses, and speed information V is obtained by performing the operation V K N T, where K is a proportional constant.
