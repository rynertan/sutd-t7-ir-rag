# Recoverable article.

## Abstract
A heat recoverable article is formed from a tube of cross linked polymeric material. Subsequent to cross linking, spaced apart portions of the article are welded together to form two separate compartments in the article. The cross linking and welding are arranged so that the weld is broken by the forces generated on recovery of the article, whereby the two compartments merge into one. An insert of solder may be provided in one of the compartments, and the other compartment may receive two electrical conductors to be spliced together.
