# Friction spinning roller roughness.

## Abstract
Friction spinning apparatus comprises two rollers arranged in parallel closely spaced relationship so as to define therebet ween adjacent the line of closets approach a throat and a fibre feed means for feeding fibres into the throat for twisting into yarn as shown in G.B. 2042599. The surface of each of the rollers has a roughness characteristic less than 250 micro inches 6.25 microns and the roller having its surface moving from the fibre feed means into the throat has a roughness less than that of the other roller by from 20 to 100 micro inches 0.5 to 2.54 microns .
