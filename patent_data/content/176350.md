# Process for preparation of synthetic fibers.

## Abstract
A non water swelling or a water insoluble thermoplastic resin, water and an assistant for assisting dispersion of water into the thermoplastic resin are melt kneaded and the kneaded composition is extruded from an orifice under such conditions that flashing of water is prevented. As the assistant, a water soluble resin or a water insoluble resin having a carboxylic acid salt group is used optionally in combination with a surface active agent. The spun product is a fiber bundle in which single filaments having a diameter smaller than 200 um are gathered in parallel to one another, to give a fiber bundle which is easily opened.
