# Aseptic packaging method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An aseptic packaging machine 1 includes a chain conveyor conveying cartons along a path P in an aseptic chamber 6 including an advance leg and a return leg each extending along the machine 1. Ultra violet germicidal lamps 8 extend over at least a major portion of the advance leg. Aseptic liquid is fed into the cartons C by a filling device 9 comprised of, in turn, an expansion chamber, a non return inlet valve, a reciprocatory bellows and a non return outlet valve. After filling, the cartons are top heated and sealed by a top heating device 10 and a top sealing device 11. The only non aseptic matter deliberately introduced into the chamber 6 is the cartons C. The chamber 6 is cleaned internally by cleaning fluid from spray nozzles. The carton entry to and exit from the chamber 6 have aseptic air curtains.
