## Description
ULTRA HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to new catalyst compositions for polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such catalyst compositions. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene in the presence of certain transition metal catalysts can be polymerized to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Typically such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures. Among the methods of producing such linear olefin polymers, some of the most widely utilized are those described by Professor Karl Ziegler in U.s.Patents 3,113,115 and 3,257,332. In these methods, the catalyst employed is obtained by admixing a compound of a transition metal of Groups IVB, VB, VIB and VIII ofMendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements with an organometallic compound. Generally, the halides, oxyhalides and alkoxides or esters of titanium, vanadium and zirconium are the most widely used transition metal compounds. Common examples of the organometallic compounds include the hydrides, alkyls and haloalkyls of aluminum, alkylaluminum halides, Grignard reagents, alkali metal aluminum hydrides, alkali metal borohydrides, alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides and the like. Usually, polymerization is carried out in a reaction medium comprising an inert organic liquid, e.g. an aliphatic hydrocarbon, and the aforementioned catalyst.One or more olefins may be brought into contact with the reaction medium in any suitable manner. A molecular weight regulator, which is normally hydrogen, is usually present in the reaction vessel in order to suppress the formation of undesirable high molecular weight polymers. Most of the aformentioned known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in slurry i.e., wherein the polymer is not dissolved in the carrier than in solution i.e., wherein the temperature is high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier . The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization is believed to be caused by deactivation of such catalysts by the higher temperatures employed in solution processes. In addition, processes involving the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins exhibit catalyst efficiencies significantly lower than ethylene homopolymerization processes. Recently, e.g. British 1,492,379, high efficiency catalysts have been disclosed which permit polymerization temperatures above 1400C. Such high polymerization temperatures provide for reduced energy requirements in solution polymerization processes in that the closer the polymerization temperature is to the boiling point of the polymerization solvent, the less energy is required in removing the solvent. U.S. Patents 4,250,286 and 4,269,733 disclose the preparation of a catalyst for polymerizing olefins in which the catalyst contains the product resulting from the admixture of a transition metal compound and a zinc compound. It has now been discovered that such catalyst can be improved if the transition metal compound is first mixed with certain oxygen containing materials before addition of the zinc compound. The catalysts subsequently prepared therefrom have higher initial rates of reaction and higher efficiencies than do those catalysts prepared without the oxygen containing material.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention in one aspect is a transition metal containing component suitable for use in the preparation of olefin polymerization catalysts which is the reaction product or complex formed by mixing at a temperature and for a time sufficient to provide a color change 1 the reaction product or complex found by mixing a a transition metal compound having at least one hydrocarbyloxy group attached to said transition metal and b a non metallic oxygen containing component with 2 an essentially non reducing alkylating agent containing a zinc alkyl wherein the atomic ratio of the metal contained in component 2 to transition metal Tm is from 0.1 1 to 10 1, preferably from 0.25 1 to 5 1 and most preferably from 0.5 1 to 2 1 and the non metallic oxygen containing component is employed in quantities so as to provide an atomic ratio of O Tm of from 0.1 1 to 4 1, preferably from 0.25 1 to 3 1 and most preferably from 0.5 1 to 2 1. Another aspect of the present invention are catalysts for polymerizing a olefins which comprise the catalytic reaction product of A the aforementioned reaction product or complex B a magnesium halide resulting from the reaction of a an organomagnesium component and b a halide source and C an organoaluminum compound, if required. A further aspect of the invention is an improved process for polymerizing ethylene and other a olefins under Ziegler polymerization conditions in the presence of a catalyst comprising a magneisum halide, a transition metal compound, and a zinc compound characterized in that the catalyst is prepared by first forming a reaction product or complex of 1 a mixture of the transition metal compound and an oxygen containing compound in quantities to provide an atomic ratio ofO Tm of 0.1 1 to 4. 1 and 2 the zinc compound and thereafter reacting with the magnesium halide and B organoaluminum compound C if required. The components are employed in quantities which provide the composition with atomic ratios of the elements as follows Mg Tm is from 1 1 to 200 1, preferably from 2 1 to 100 1 and most preferably from 5 1 to 75 1. Al Tm is from 0.1 1 to 200 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 100 1 and most preferably from 1 1 to 75 1. Excess X Al is from 0.0005 1 to 5 1, preferably from 0.002 1 to 2 1 and most preferably from 0.01 1 to 1.4 1. Excess X is the amount of halide above that amount which is theoretically required to convert the organomagnesium component to magnesium dihalide. The present invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process wherein an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalytic reaction product as hereinbefore described. Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene and higher a olefins using the catalytic reaction product of this invention The foregoing polymerization process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low pressures, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are generally the aliphatic a monoolefins or non conjugated a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms.

Particularly suitable zinc compounds include, for example, diethyl zinc, dimethyl zinc, ethyl zinc chloride, diphenyl zinc and mixtures thereof. By the term essentially non reducing it is meant that simple mixing of the alkylating agent with the titanium species at normal conditions does not lead to a reduction in the oxidation state of the titanium compound. Suitable non metallic oxygen containing compounds which can be employed herein include, for example, molecular oxygen, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters of carboxylic acids, peroxides, and water. Those compounds which are soluble in hydrocarbon solvent are especially preferred.

Suitable organomagnesium components which can be employed in the present invention include those represented by the empirical formula MgR 2 xMR y wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy,M is aluminum7 zinc or mixtures thereof and x is zero to 10, preferably zero to 5, most preferably from zero to 2.5 and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl and or hydrocarbyloxy groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred.Likewise, preferably, hydrocarbyloxy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkoxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being preferred. Hydrocarbyl is preferred over hydrocarbyloxy. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary suitable magnesium dialkyls include particularly n butyl sec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyl n butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium and others wherein the alkyl has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and ditolylmagnesium. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. Among the halide sources which can be employed herein are the active non metallic halides and metallic halides. Suitable non metallic halides are represented by the empirical formula R X wherein R is hydrogen or an active monovalent organic radical and X is a halogen.Particularly suitable non metallic halides include, for example, hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides wherein hydrocarbyl is as defined hereinbefore. By an active organic halide is meant a hydrocarbyl halide that contains a labile halogen at least as active, i.e. as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride, preferably as active as t butyl chloride. In addition to the organic monohalides, it is understood that organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides that are active as defined hereinbefore are also suitably employed.Examples of preferred active nonmetallic halides include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide, and diphenyl methyl chloride. Most preferred are hydrogen chloride, t butyl chloride, allyl chloride and benzyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides which can be employed herein include those represented by the empirical formula MIRY AXE wherein M is a metal of Groups IIIA orIVA, of Mendeleevts Periodic Table of Elements, R is a monovalent organic radical, X is a halogen, y has a value corresponding to the valence of M and a has a value from 1 to y. A suitable metallic halide isSnCl4, although the preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the empirical formula AlR3,aXa wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl as herein before defined such as alkyl, X is a halogen and a is a number from 1 to 3. Most preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethylaluminum sesquichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, and diethylaluminum bromide, with ethylaluminum dichloride being especially preferred. Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be suitably employed. It is understood that the organic moieties of the aforementioned organomagnesium, e.g. R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g. R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficently active to react with the Zerewitinoff reagent. In preparing the reaction product or complex of the present invention, the transition metal component and oxygen containing component are mixed together in a suitable inert solvent or diluent followed by the addition of the alkylating agent in a quantity and under suitable conditions so as to effect a color change in the reaction mixture. Suitable conditions include temperatures of from about 500C to 1100C, preferably from OOC to 300C. At lower temperatures, longer times may be required to effect a color change. The reaction time is also affected by the concentration of the reactants, e.g. low concentrations require longer times at any given temperature than do higher concentrations. The solvents which can be employed include those suitable for preparing the catalysts of this invention with the hydrocarbon solvents being most suitable. The color change which occurs upon addition of the essentially non reducing alkylating agent varies depending upon the particular components employed, i.e.the particular oxygen containing compound and or the particular alkylating agent. The magnesium halide can be preformed from the organomagnesium compound and the halide source or it can be prepared in situ in which instance the catalyst is prepared by mixing in a suitable solvent 1 the organomagnesium component, B l, 2 the halide source,B 2 and 3 the reaction product or complex formed by mixing, a a mixture of said transition metal component A l.l and said oxygen containing component A 1,2 and b said alkylating agent A 2 . The foregoing catalyst components are combined in proportions sufficient to provide atomic ratios as previously mentioned. In cases wherein neither the organomagnesium component nor the halide source contains aluminum or contains an insufficient quantity of aluminum, it is necessary to include in the total catalyst an aluminum compound such as an alkyl aluminum compound, e.g. a trialkyl aluminum7 an alkyl aluminum halide or an aluminum halide. If polymerization temperatures below 1800C are employed, the atomic ratios of Al Ti may be from 0.1 1 to 200 1, preferably from 1 1 to 100 1.However, when polymerization temperatures above 1800C are employed, the aluminum compound is used in proportions such that the Mg Al ratio is more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1, and Al Ti ratio is less than 120 1, preferably less than 50 1. It is understood, however, that the use of very low amounts of aluminum necessitates the use of high purity solvents or diluents in the polymerization zone. Further, other components present in the zone should be essentially free of impurities which react with aluminum alkyls. Otherwise, additional quantities of an organometallic compound as previously described, preferably an organoaluminum compound, must be used to react with such impurities.Moreover, it is understood that in the catalyst the aluminum compound should be in the form of trialkyl aluminum or alkyl aluminum halide provided that the alkyl aluminum halide be substantially free of alkyl aluminum dihalide. In the above mentioned aluminum compounds, the alkyl groups independently have from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10, carbon atoms. When additional quantities of aluminum compound are employed, it can be added to the aforementioned catalyst during the preparation thereof or the aluminum deficient catalyst can be mixed with the appropriate aluminum compound prior to entry into the polymerization reactor or, alternatively, the aluminum deficient catalyst and the aluminum compound can be added to the polymerization reactor as separate streams or additions. The foregoing catalytic reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent.The concentrations of catalyst components are preferably such that when the essential components of the catalytic reaction product are combined, the resultant slurry is from 0.005 to 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium. By way of an example of suitable inert organic diluents can be mentioned liquified ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from about 50 to 2000C.Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, decalin and the like. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatures in the range from 100 to 2000C, preferably from about 0 to 1000C.The period of mixing is not considered to be critical as it is found that a sufficient catalyst composition most often occurs within about 1 minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. In order to maximize catalyst efficiency, the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in the following order organomagnesium compound, halide source, the aluminum compound if required, and the reaction product or complex formed from said transition metal compound, oxygen containing compound and alkylating agent. This is not to imply, however, that other orders of addition would not result in catalysts having very high efficiencies. In the polymerization process employing the aforementioned catalytic reaction product, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the above catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing at least one a olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures in the range from about 0 to 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from about 1300 to 2500C, for a residence time of a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. It is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen land a catalytic amount of the catalytic reaction product is generally within the range from 0.0001 to 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent.It is understood, however, that the most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons and that the foregoing range is given to obtain maximum catalyst yields in weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally, in the polymerization process, a carrier which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer is employed.In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized. For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. It is understood that inert diluents employed in the polymerization recipe are suitably as defined hereinbefore. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively low, e.g., from 0.45 7.09 MPa 50 to 1000 psig , especially from 0.80 5.00 MPa 100 to 700 psig . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment. During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures througout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range of from 1 to 10 weight percent, most advantageously from 1.2 to 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed in the practice of this invention to control the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. For the purpose of this invention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers.It is understood that hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization can be allowed to remain unstirred while the polymerization takes place. In the case of more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present, in order to remove the heat of reaction. In any event, adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material.The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling media to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent if any is employed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the catalyst residue removal steps. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reagent of the types conventionally employed for deactivating Ziegler catalysts. The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention. All percentages are by weight and all parts are by molar or atomic ratio unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLES 1 10 AND COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS A, B AND CA. Preparation of the Titanium Complexes All titanium alcohol diethyl zinc complexes were prepared by simple admixture of the neat tetraisopropyl titanate TiPT with the neat n propanol n PrOH , followed by addition of a 15 solution of diethyl zinc DEZ in Isobar E an isoparaffinic hydrocarbon fraction having a boiling range of 1160C 1340C . After development of a dark, usually greenish color generally within 30 minutes , the mixture was diluted to give an overall titanium concentration of 0.025 molar. The complexes were then used in catalyst preparations.B. Preparation of the Catalyst In a narrow mouth catalyst bottle under an inert atmosphere was mixed the following components in the following order 97.80 ml Isobar E 0.80 ml of 0.94 M ethylaluminum dichloride EADC 0.80 ml of 0.745 M di n hexyl magnesium as obtained commercially from Lithium Corporation of America 0.60 ml of 0.025 M titanium complex 100.00 ml Various titanium.n propanol.diethyl zinc complexes were employed as shown in examples 1 12 ofTable I. In addition, one catalyst was prepared containing only tetraisopropyl titanate comparative experiment A and one catalyst contained a tetraisopropyl titaniate diethyl zinc complex comparative experiment B , taught in U.S. Patents 4,250,286 and 4,269,733. C. Polymerization Into a stirred one gallon batch reactor was added 2.liters of Isopare E, 0.028 MPa 4 psig of hydrogen, 1.22 MPa 175 psig of ethylene, and 10 ml 0.0015 mmoles Ti of the previously described catalysts.Ethylene pressure was kept constant at 1.40 MPa 200 psig the solvent vapor pressure being 0.25 MPa 21 psig and the reactor temperature was controlled at 1500C. Because of the high initial activities of these catalysts, an initial exotherm is produced, the size of which is dependent on catalyst activity the higher the exotherm, the higher the initial catalyst activity .This exotherm can be controlled to some extent by cooling the reactor with large volumes of air blown past the reactor. Total reaction time was 30 minutes. Catalyst efficiencies and exotherms are listed in TableI. It is obvious from the data in Table I that the addition of small quantities of an alcohol followed by diethyl zinc leads to a large and unexpected increase in catalyst activity as evidenced by improved exotherms and catalyst efficiencies. Not all ratios of Ti ROH DEZ improves catalyst efficiency, however, as large amounts 5 or greater mole parts leads to poorer efficiencies.Also, a point is reached on DEZ where additional DEZ will not improve catalyst efficiency and may even lower the observed efficiency. These runs show that the addition of 1 or 2 alcohols along with 2 or more DEZ gives the optimum efficiency.EXAMPLES 11 13A. Preparation of the Titanium Complexes Additional complexes were prepared as in examples 1 10 above, however this time n butanol or ethanol were employed. After development of the dark color green for butanol and blue for ethanol , the solutions were diluted to 0.025 Molar in titanium concentration.B. Preparation of the Catalyst Catalysts were prepared in a manner indentical to that outlined in examples 1 10 above using the titanium alcohol diethyl zinc complex shown in Table I.C. Polymerization Polymerization conditions were identical to those outlined in examples 1 10 above. Catalyst exotherms and efficiencies are listed in Table I. By comparing examples 11 and 5 and examples 12, 13 and 4, it is readily apparent that the type of alcohol used i.e., the size of the alkyl group has little effect on the catalyst exotherm and efficiency.EXAMPLES 14 17A. Preparation of the Titanium Complexes Complexes were prepared as previously described, except that n butanol, acetone and water were used as the oxygen containing compounds. The H2O and acetone mixtures were diluted to 0.025 Molar while the n butanol was diluted to O.0336 Molar, both in titanium.B. Preparation of the Catalysts Catalysts were prepared in similar fashion to examples 1 10 above using the following compounds. 98.20 x ml of Isobar E 0.80 ml of 0.94 M EADC l,.00 ml of 0.60 M n butyl sec butyl Mg obtained from Lithium Corporation of America x ml of y M titanium compound 100.00 ml where x and y as well as the titanium compound can be found in the following table EXAMPLE x,ml y,M Compound 14 0.60 0.025 1 TIPT1 H2O 3 DEZ 15 0.60 0.0336 1 TiPT l BuOH 3 DEZ 16 0.45 0.0336 1 TiPT 1 BuOH.3 DEZ 17 0.60 0.025 1 TiPT 1 acetone.3 DEZC. Polymerization All polymerizations were conducted at 1500C using 0.13 MPa 19 psig of hydrogen and 1.12 MPa 160 psig of ethylene. The length of these runs was 20 minutes. Run results can be found in Table II. These run results once again show that the oxygen compound used has little effect on catalyst efficiency, although it did effect the exotherm in the case of acetone. In example 15, a lower efficiency based on titanium resulted from increased titanium levels in the catalyst even though the initial activity of the catalyst appeared higher than the others during the run.COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS D, E AND FA. Preparation of the Titanium Complexes A tetraisopropyltitanate diethyl zinc complex was prepared by mixing the neat TiPT with the 15 DEZ 1 1 molar ratio . To one aliquot of this solution was added 1 mole part BuOH. To another aliquot was added 1 mole part H20. All solutions were then diluted to 0.025 M in Ti concentration. These solutions were then used to prepare catalysts.B. Preparation of the Catalyst Catalysts were prepared in a manner similar to that previously described in examples 1 10. The procedure used was 97.79 ml of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane 0.80 ml of 0.94 M EADC 0.60 ml of 0.025 M titanium complex 1.11 ml of 0.54 M n butyl sec butyl Mg 100.00 ml The oxygen containing component employed to form the titanium complex is shown in Table 11. C. Polymerization Polymerization was conducted as previously described using 2,2,4 trimethylpentane as the reaction solvent and using 0.06 MPa 9 psig of hydrogen and 0.91 MPa 130 psig of ethylene for a total pressure of 1.36 MPa 180 psig including the 0.39 MPa 41 psig solvent vapor pressure . Results of these runs are given in Table II. Comparative experiments E and F show a decrease in catalyst efficiency as compared to experiment D even though an oxygen containing compound and diethyl zinc have been added. This is due to the order of mixing.If the diethyl zinc is added to the titanium species, a change of color occurs. If the oxygen containing species is then added, an additional color change may occur and the resulting titanium complex shows a reduced efficiency over catalysts made by the preferred method.
