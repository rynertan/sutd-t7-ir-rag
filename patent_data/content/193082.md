# Thermosetting epoxy resin compositions and thermosets therefrom.

## Abstract
Described are novel thermosetting epoxy resin composi tions suitable for making cured resins, prepregs and stiff, tough thermoset composites. The thermosetting composi tions comprise a polyepoxide component, an amine harden er and a specified amount of certain aromatic oligomers containing functional groups which are reactive with the polyepoxide and or hardener under curing conditions for the composition. The cured resins have a multiphase morpholo gy which comprises at least one glassy continuous phase and at least one glassy discontinuous phase and have a fracture toughness, K
