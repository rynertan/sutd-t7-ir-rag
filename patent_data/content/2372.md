# Subterranean storage pool for liquids and method for using the same.

## Abstract
A liquid such as crude oil or fuel is stored in a subterranean pool 1 covered with a diaphragm like cover plate 7 sealingly applied thereto. On the cover plate is superimposed a protective body 17, 18 consisting of sand, soil, stones, rubbish, rocks or mixtures thereof. The protective body may be level with the terrain or be projecting thereabove. Inside the pool a pressure is established hydraulically or pneumatically equal to that exerted by the protective body on the cover plate and in this way the protective body is sustained via the cover plate. For the hydraulic method a pressurized working liquid is used, e.g. water. For the pneumatic method a compressed gas is used such as air, a combustion gas, an inert gas or a paraffin gas. Various methods for mounting the cover plate are disclosed.
