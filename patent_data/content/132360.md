## Description
PLANT GROWTH MEDIUM Field of the Invention The invention relates to artificial plant qrowth media and methods of using the media for callus growth, shoot tip multiplication and shoot initiation. Backqround of the Invention Plant propagation from the shoot tips of trowing plants is an important horticultural technique long used to insure the rrorphological uniformity of ornamental plants and standardization of fruit type in orchard crops. From a sinqle shoot tip of a plant having a desirable characteristic, many identical plants all possessinq the same desirable characteristic can be obtained usinq a shoot multiplication system. The advantages of shoot tip multipliction for the propaqation of ornamental plants and orchard crops have been well appreciated in the horticultural arts for a number of years, but the aqronomic arts have only recently begun to tap the potential of such proraqation methods. The uses of such propaqation methods are many. For example, vegetative propaqation may be used for inbred or even hybrid plant strains which have potentially valuable or scientifically interestinq characteristics that are unstable when sexually reproduced. In addition, shoot tip propagation has been used to eliminate certain plant viral diseases in qrowinq plant stocks, relying on the observation that a number of plant viruses that infect the plant stem do not infect the growing shoot tip of the same plant. Shoot tip propaqation may also be used to perpetuate chromosomal changes in a plant line. In a heterozyqous Plant, the mutation of a domi nant gene to a re recessive state will lead to immediate expression of the recessive condition. If the change is in a detectable characteristic, shoot tips taken fram the cultured plant tissue can be propagated asexually to give any number of plants of the new form. In this manner, numerous copies of a single plant, or part of a plant, having an aqronomically valuable characteristic can be provided for back crossing into the parent strain or for outbreedinq to form new hybrids.Importantly, because many copies of the original plant can be propaqated asexually usinq shoot tip multiplication, such backcrossing and hybridization programs can be undertaken without fear of losing the plant type oriqinally displaying the desirable characteristic. The e inventor has discovered plant growth media which makes it possible to culture Helianthus annuus H. annuus in a number of different ways. The fruits or seeds of H. annuus are the commercial source of sunflower seed oil. When one of the media, supplemented with a particular complex of plant hormones and vitamins, is used, multiple shoots may be obtained frcm explants of H. annuus shoot tips. The term shoot tip as used in the specification means shoot apex and all subtendinq leaf primordia or axillary buds. Moreover and entirely unexpected is the findinq that in a number of inbred strains of H. annuus, when the multiple shoots develop leaves, the leaves develop adventitious shoots.This medium is particularly significant since it makes possible the formation of adventitious shoots directly fran differentiated tissue, i.e., leaves of a sunflower plant. Thus, the utility of the medium lies in its abilitv to allow vegetative propagation of an important oil producing croup plant and the manipulation of such vegetative propaqules for the purpose of mprov ing the strain. The inventor has further discovered that a second medium, using a differently formulated complex of vitamins and hormones can be used to form undifferentiated callus from explants of almost all sunflower tissues. As is shown in the examples hereinbelow, callus may be induced on the medium using hypocotyl seqments of sunflower seedlings. In addition, tissue fran practically any part of the mature sunflower plant including but not limited to for example stem, shoot tip, leaf bud, axillarv bud and even stem pith may be used to initiate callus. When this callus is used to inoculate cell suspension cultures in a suspension medium, the growth characteristics of the cells in culture can be correlated with a high deqree of confidence with the oil content of the seeds of the whole plant. Thus, the growth of callus is an important step in a method of screening prospective sunflower seed lines for oil content without the effort cost or time of field trials of the sunflower seed plant. With respect to the media developed by the inventor, only the minimal salts that the media use are based on Murashige and Skoog mineral salts medium MS medium . MS medium is typically used for plant cell culture and is described in Murashiqe, T. and Skooq, F. 1962 PhysiologiaPlantarium., 15 473 97. The following minimal salts are typically found in the media magnesium sulfate.seven hydrate MgSO4,7H2O , calcium chloride.dihydrate CaCl2.2H2O , potassium nitrate KN03 , ammonium nitrate NH4N03 , potassium phosphate KH2P04 , manganese sulfate.four hydrate MnSO4.4H2O , zinc sulfate seven hydrate ZnSO4.7H2O , cupric sulfatefive hydrate CuSO4.5H2O , cobalt chloride six hydrate CoCl2.6H2O potassium iodide KI , boric acid H3B03 , sodium molybdinum oxide.dihydrate Na2MoO4.2H2O , ferrous sulfate.seven hydrate FeSO4.7H2O , and sodium ethylenediaminotetracetic acid Na2EDTA .In general, as used in the invention, the exact concentration of the salts can be varied within limits without departing from the invention. To standardize the making of the media, however, the concentrations of the above listed minimal salts are as follows MgSO4.7H2O 370 milligrams liter mg l CaCl2.2H2O 440 mg lKNO3 1900 mg lNH4NO3 1650 mg lKH2P04 170 mq l MnSO4.4H2O 22.3 mg l ZnS04 7H20 8.6 mq lCuSO4.5H2O 0.025 mg l CoC12 6H20 0.025 mg lKI 0.83 mg lH3BO3 6.2 mg lNa2MoO4.2H2O 0.25 mg lFeSO4.7H2O 28.75 mg l Na2EDrA 37.25 mg l Depending upon the particular use for which the media is formulated, a number of vitamins are added to the medium in the following amounts inositol up to and includinq about 500 mq l thiamine HCL up to and includinq about 40 mq l nicotinic acid up to and includinq about 20 mq l pyridoxine.HCl up to and including about 4 mg l.In one form, generally used for shoot formation, as described further hereinbelow, glycine is also added up to and includinq about 2 mq l. In general the amount of the various vitamins will vary as used in the mixture, dependinq upon the particular purpose for which the medium is used, however, the vitamins will generally be in an amount sufficient to sustain vigorous growth of the sunflower explant or callus suspension to be grown in the particular medium. Also dependinq upon the particular use to which the medium will be put, plant hormones are added. The plant hormones which may be used include auxins and cytokinins, however, when it is desired to generate multiple shoots or adventitious shoots, no auxin type hormone is used. Various auxin type hormones have been used in the media and are exemplified by naphthalene acetic acid NA , indole butyric acid IBA , indoleacetic acid IAA and 2, 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4 D . The auxins have been used at various concentrations in the media and in general the results obtained vary within the range of concentrations for the auxins that have been tried. The concentration ranges for the various auxins are as follows. about 0.01 10 m l IBk about 1 10 mg l about 1 4 mq l 2,4 D about 0.01 1 ma l. Various cytokinin type hormones have been used in the media and are exemplified by benzyl adenine BA , zeatin Z , kinetin K and N6 2 isopentyl adenine 2iP . The cytokinin hormones have also been used at various concentrations in the various media and in qeneral the results obtained vary within the range of concentrations for the cytokinin that have been tried. The e concentration ranqes for the various cytokinins are generally between about 0.1 mg l to about 10 mg l. Generally BA and K are preferred for shoot multiplication and adventitious shoot induction. In addition to the above mentioned components, all the media contain sucrose. The concentration of sucrose may vary but generally an amount sufficient to permit sustained growth of the sunflower explants, callus or cells will be included. Typically, the sucrose con concentration will be about 3 w v or about 30 grams per liter final volume of medium. The media may also include an amount of coconut water GrandIsland Biochemical Conipany , in a range up to about 50 vAr of the medium.For callus induction, however, the coconut water may be used optionally.If the medium is to be used for shoot multiplication or adventitious shoot formation, the coconut water is generally omitted. Lastly, if solid media is required for either callus induction shoot tip multiplication or adventitious shoot formation, a hardenina agent such as agar, in an amount sufficient to yield hard medium, general ly about 6 wtA7 is added. Formulations for the various media and the uses thereof will be better understood from the following examples. It is to be understood that these examples are not intended to be limiting. Thus, variations in the growth charactertistics of the various plant tissue is expected. EXAMPLE I The pericarp or hull is removed from Helianthus annuus 89B sunflower fruits. The seeds are removed fran the fruits and sterilized for 15 minutes in 30 bleach with 1 2 drops dishwashinq soap. Following rinsing in sterile distilled water, the seeds are planted in test tubes, 2 per tube, in a medium of 0.5 sucrose, 1 agar and the following salts in the concentrations indicated MgSO4.7H2O 370 mg l CaCl2.2H2O 440 mg l KNO3 1900 mg l NH4NO3 1650 mq l andKH2PO4 170 mg l.The seeds are germinated in the dark for 4 5 days, followed by 1 2 days in the light. Two millimeter mm hypocotyl seqments are then placed on the following medium MgSO4.7H2O 370 mg lCaCl2.2H2O 440 mg lKNO3 1900 mg lNH4NO3 1650 mg lKH2Po4 170 mg lMnSO4.4H2O 22.3 mg lZnSO4.7H2O 8.6 mg l CUSO4 5H20 0.025 mq lCoC12 6H2O 0.025 mq lKI 0.83 mq l H3BO3 6.2 mq lNa2MoO4.2H2O 0.25 mg lFeSO4.7H2O 28.75 mg lNa2EDTA 37.25 mg l inositol 100 mq l thiamine HCl 40 mg l nicotinic acid 20 mg l pyridoxine.HCl 1 mg l alpha naphthaleneacetic acid 1 mg l benzyladenine 1 mg l sucrose 30 qrams l H2O distilled to 1000 ml 6.3 agar 6.0 gms The 2 mm hypocotyl segments are cultured in the dark for 2 weeks. Friable callus is removed and subcultured on the same medium. Friable callus can be maintained and transferred to such medium every 2 weeks. EXAMPLE II The pericarp or hull is removed from Helianthus annuus 89B sunflower fruits. The seeds are removed and are sterilized for 15 in 30 bleach with 1 2 drops dishwashing soap. Following rinsinq in sterile distilled water, the seeds are planted, 2 per tube, in a medium 0.5 sucrose, 1 agar and the time following minimal salts at the following concentrations KH2PO4 170 mg l NH4NO3 1650 mq lKNO3 1900 mg lCaCl2.2H2O 440 mg lMgSO4.7H2O 370 mg l.The seeds are germinated in the dark for 4 5 days followed by 1 2 days in the light. The apical tips with shoot primordia intact are removed from the seedlings by cuttinq with a sterile scalpel, perpendicularly to the lonqitudinal axis of the seedling.The e shoot tip is then cut in half alonq the longitudinal axis of the shoot tip. The cut shoot tips are placed on a shoot growth medium having the following composition MgSO4.7H2O 370 mg lCaCL2.2H2O 440 mg lKNO3 1900 mg lNH4NO3 1650 mq l KH2PO4 170 mg lMnSO4.4H2O 22.3 mg lZnSO4.7H2O 8.6 mg lCuSO4.5H2O 0.025 mg lCoCl2 6H20 0.025 mq lKI 0.83 mg lH3BO3 6.2 mg lNa2MoO4.2H2O 0.25 mg lFeSO4.7H2O 28.75 mg lNa2EDTA 37.25 mg l inos itol 100 mg l thiamine HCl 0.1 mg I nicotinic acid 0.5 mq l pyridoxine HCl 0.5 mg l glycine 2 0 mg l benzyladenine 0.5 mg l or kinetin 1.0 mq l sucrose 30 qrams l H2O distilled to 1000 ml final volume pH 6.3 agar 6.0 RTI ID 7.12 gms The half shoot apices were cultured on this medium in the light for approximately 2 months and were transferred to new medium approximately every 3 weeks durinq this period. The plants were scored for formation of multiple shoots, rooting, flowering and formation of adventitious shoots at 3 weeks. Adventitious shoots are defined as shoots formed from cells that are not part of a preformed shoot meristem. On the half shoot apices explanted from Helianthus 89B, multiple shoots and new leaves qrew from the shoot primorida. The shoots were removed from the culture medium and placed into hormone free i.e., lack inq BA or R medium and, when roots formed, were planted in the qreenhouse. EXAMPLE III Sunflower seeds of Stauffer inbred line SS 405B, were germinated as in Example II above. SS 405B is described in Application for PlantVariety Protection Certificate Plant Variety Protection Office Number 8300132. Shoot tips were obtained and divided as in Example II above and placed on the medium described in Example II above. At about 3 weeks after placement on the shoot growth medium, multiple shoots and leaves had already qrown fran the shoot tips and adventitious shoots were observed forming on the leaves of the explant. EXAMPLE IV Rooting of shoots developey by the procedures described in Example II above is carried out as follows. Multiple shoots are induced using the media and methods described in Example II except that if benzyladenine is used its concentration is kept at or below 0.1 mg l. Benzyladenine concentrations of 0.5 mg l allowed no root formation. If kinetin is used its concentration is kept at or below 1.0 ms l. Multiple shoots are removed fran the shoot apex explant and are placed on the following media with or without hormones as indicated inTable I below B5 medium Gamborq et al., 1968 Exp. Cell.

After 4 7 days, the plastic cover was removed. One month later the rooted plants were transferred to larger pots and grown to maturity in the greenhouse.The plants thus produced set flowers and produced seeds upon maturation. EXAMPLE V Multiple sunflower shoots that failed to root in Example IV hereinabove were grafted to rooted sunflower plants in a modification of the method of Habermann and Wallace, Habermann, H.M. and Wallace, R.H., 1958 , Am. J. Bot., 5 479 482. The shoots were removed from the rooting medium. The e epicotyl was trimned with a sterile razor blade to form a substantially V shaped wedge which served as a graft. Root stocks were provided by trowing germinated seeds of inbred sunflower seed lines of SS405B or 89B for five days to to weeks to yield seedlinqs. The seelings were prepared to receive the grafts by makinq a first cut throuqh the hypocotyl of the seedling closely below the ootyledon in a plane substantially perpendicular to the lonq axis of the seedling. The hypocotyl was then incised in a plane substantially parallel to the long axis of the seedlinq and perpendicular through the first cut to form a slit. The graft was placed in the slit with the apex of the substantially V shaped wedge oriented toward the roots of the root stock. The graft was secured in the slit by a single turn of knotted cotton thread. The e graft was kept moist for 1 2 weeks by covering with an inverted jar, test tube or plastic baq. After 1 2 weeks, the cotton thread was removed and the graft was grown to maturity in the greenhouse.The grafts set flowers and seed upon maturation.
