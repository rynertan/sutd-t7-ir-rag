## Description
The present invention relates to a novel chimeric plasmid vector which is useful as a cloning vector for In genetic manipulation In order that a vector be operable as such, it must at least contain a sequence essential for self replication and have a recognition and cleavage site for a restriction enzyme at which a donor DNA can be inserted within the vector, as well known in the art. From the practical point of view, however, vectors to be used for purposes of genetic manipulation are required to meet various other serious requirements. These requirements include the availability of restriction enzymes which will contribute to and facilitate the genetic manipulation, the variety of option for the recognition and cleavage sites available in the restriction enzymes, high efficiencies in the transformation and its phenotypic expression, the presence of marker genes useful for the detection of, for example, the transformants, the compatibility of the vectors with the host cells, the broadness of the range of the host cells compatible with the vectors, the stability of the vectors in the host cells, and the adaptability of the vectors to possible biological containment. By reason of these numerous strict requirements, there have been developed actually only a limited number of useful vectors even in host vector systems using Under the circumstances, Applicants have made extensive research and development efforts in quest of useful plasmid vectors, with a view to providing established host vector systems using such vectors. These efforts have been directed particularly to host vector systems using Applicants have further made efforts to develop more and other useful plasmid vectors. These continued efforts have now resulted in the development of excellent chimeric shuttle vectors which not only have beneficial microbial properties comparable to those of known plasmid vectors but also permit the use of various restriction enzymes.

As shown in Fig. 1, the plasmid pHY340 has a molecular weight of about 3.4 megadaltons and contains two Specific examples of the polylinker operable in the process of preparing a chimeric plasmid vector according to the present invention include It may however be remembered that these examples of the polylinker operable for the preparation of a chimeric plasmid vector according to the present invention are merely for the purpose of description and are not limitative of the scope of the invention. The present invention will be better understood from the following Examples. Five point seven ul of a 10 fold concentrated buffer containing 100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 , 70mM MgCl₂, 70 mM β mercaptoethanol and 500 mM NaCl was added to 53 µl of pHY340 DNA 100 µg ml , followed by addition of 2 µl of 6 unit µl To 150 µl of the plasmid DNA approximately 0.5 µg in weight obtained by the procedure 1 were added an equal volume of competent cells of Each of the transformants obtained by the procedure 2 above was suspended in 0.2 ml of a solution consisting of 0.2 mg ml lysozyme and 0.05 mg ml ribonuclease RNase . The resultant preparation, with addition of 0.2 ml of 0.2 dodecylsodiumsulfate SDS solution, was incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 minutes, subsequently allowed to stand at 0 C for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 0 C. To the supernatant thus obtained was added an equal volume of phenol saturated with buffer A which consisted of 10mM Tris and 0.1 mM EDTA pH 7.4 , followed by vigorous shaking. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature to collect the aqueous layer containing DNA. Fifteen microlitre fractions of the DNA containing preparation were electrophoresed on a 0.8 agarose gel.
