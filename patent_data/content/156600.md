## Description
COMPOSITE FIBER BLENDS This invention relates to a fiber tow and to a process for preparing it. Such tows are useful in forming composite articles. More particularly, this invention involves the use of fiber blends containing strong reinforcing fibers which are useful in preparing composite articles. Fiber reinforced products have been known for several years see, for example, U.S. Patents Nos.3,914,499 3,969,171 and 4,214,931, as well as U.S. Patent No. 4,341,835. It is known to intermix two similar or different types of fibers, particularly to obtain high bulk see,for example, U.S.Patents Nos. 4,219,997,4,218,869,3,959,962, 3.968,638, and 3,958,310. The combining of different types of fibers has been facilitated using various types of fluid jets see, for example, U.S. Patents Nos. 3,958,310 and 4,147,020. In No.4,147,020, the yarns are cut into short lengths after being combined. U.S. Patent No. 4,226,079, discloses the combining of two different types of fibers in order to produce a bulk yarn. The fibers are intermixed in a jet intermixing zone.The fibers disclosed in the patent are polyester and poly ar..id fibers. There is no indication of combining carbon and thermoplastic fibers. U.S. Patent No. 3,175,351 discloses a method of bulking continuous filament yarns. In addition, it is disclosed that the two yarns which are combined may be of different compositions. There is no indication that any of the yarns might be a carbon fiber yarn. U.S. Patent No. 3,859,158 discloses the preparation of carbon fiber reinforced composite articles by forming an open weave of a carbon fiber and coating with a carbonaceous material. U.S. Patent No. 4,368,234 discloses complex woven materials used for reinforcement which are formed from alternating bands of graphite fibers and low modulus fibers. The woven materials disclosed in this patent are subsequently impregnated with a thermosetting resin and cured. According to an earlier proposal, believed to be unpublished at the priority date of this application, it has been suggested to provide an improved woven fabric comprising fusible and infusible fibers wherein the infusible fibers include graphite or carbon fibers, and .he fusible fibers are thermoplastic in nature. According to that proposal,fusible and infusible fibers are woven into a fabric and thermally bonded together by heating above the melting point of the fusible fiber. That proposal does not suggest the preparation of linearly intermixed fiber tow products nor does it in any way suggest that such products would be useful in forming composite articles. Yore over that proposal does not suggest the preparation of such materials using a gas jet intermixing means. In the prior art, there were two distinct methods cf forming fiber reinforced composites. The first and slder method involved simply forming a tape or fabric .repeg by painting or coating reinforcing fiber tows or fabric with a solution and or low viscosity melt of a thermosetting material which was then cured. The second process involved the extrusion of reinforcing fiber tapes Impregnated with high melting, thermoplastic polymers.These tapes or fabrics were then used in forming the com polite. However,the prepreg formed by both of these processes were somewhat difficult to handle. Specifically, prior art thermoplastic tapes were stiff and boardy and could not be draped across intricately shaped molds. While hermoset prepregs were somewhat more flexible, they were cften quite tacky and difficult to handle. As a result, the use of both types of tapes was limited. It is an object of this invention to provide fibrous blends which are useful in forming fiber reinforced composites, and which reduce or avoid the disadvantages of the prior art. The invention provides a continuous fiber tow useful in forming composite articles which comprises an intimate blend of 90 to 30 by volume, based on the total fiber content, of a spun thermoplastic fiber having a melting point of at least 50go. and 10 to 70 by volume, based on the total fiber content, of a non thermoplastic reinforcing fiber. In general, the tows of the invention are capable of being formed into articles having a radius of curvature of at least 0.002 inch 0.05 mm . The invention also provides a process of preparing a fiber tow which comprises a forming a tow of non thermoplastic reinforc ing fibers b forming a continuous tow of spun thermoplastic polymer fibers having a melting point of at least 500C c intermixing the non thermoplastic reinforc ing fiber tow and the thermoplastic polymer fiber tow, and d withdrawing the intermixed tow. It will be seen from the above that the process of this invention involves a forming a fiber tow from a multitude of strong filamentary reinforcement materials b forming a thermoplastic polymeric fiber tow c intermixing the two tows and d withdrawing the intermixed tows for use. The filamentary reinforcing material is nonthermoplastic. The intermixed tows may then be employed in forming various fiber reinforced composites. The fiber blends prepared according to the invention are flexible and handleable and have good draping properties, so that they can be used to form intricately shaped articles. In addition, because of the intermixing of the two fibers1 good wetting of the reinforcing fiber by the thermoplastic material is obtained when appropriate heat and pressure are applied to the mold. Good wetting is obtained in large measure because of the substantially uniform distribution of the thermoplastic fiber and the reinforcing fiber within the fiber blend. Specifically, the products of the invention find particular utility in end use applications where a small radius of curvature in the final product is desired. For example, using the prior art tapes, it was not possible in many instances to prepare articles which had 900 bend, because tapes would crack or deform at the bend line.However, the tows of the invention may be employed with radii or curvature as low as 0.002 in 0.05 morn . The invention is illustrated by the drawings, in which FIG.1 is a diagramatic view of the various devices used in carrying out one of the process of the invention. FIG.2 is a diagramatic view of the various devices used in carrying out another version of the process of the invention. FIG.3 is a perspective view of the gas spreading means used in carrying out a part of the process of the invention. FIG.4 is a perspective view of the same device with the top removed. The thermoplastic polymers which are useful in carrying out the invention may belong to virtually any type of relatively high molecular weight thermoplastic polymer, including polyethylene,polypropylene, polyester , the various polyamides, polyimides, polyamidimides,polyetheri mides,pclysulfones e.g. polyether sulfones , polyether ether ketones, polybutylene terephthalate and the like. The melting point of the polymer should generally be at least 500F 280C , preferably at least 2000F 1110C above ambient temperature. Higher melting temperatures ensure that there will be no undue sticking or binding of the spun fibers prior to use. In addition to one component polymer systems, mixtures of various thermoplastic polymers may also be employed to advantage where specific combinations of properties are desired. Of particular importance are the liquid crystal polymers or LCP s Examples of these polymers include the wholly aromatic polyester resins which are discussed in the following publicatlons a Polyesters of HydroxybenzoicAcids, by Russell ilkey and John R.

The R2 aromatic ring systems should preferably be unsubstituted when only one kind of unit I and one kind of unit II are used, i.e., when a homopolymer is formed to ensure obtaining oriented fibers.In the case of copolymers, it is preferred that the R2 aromatic ring systems be unsubstituted because of thermal or hydrolytic instability and or cost of the R2 ring substituted copolymers. Also included are those co polyesters wherein up to 25 mol , preferably up to 5 mol , based on the totalI,II, and III units, are aromatic polymer forming units i.e., units wherein the chain extending functional groups are attached to aromatic rings not conforming to those described above and which do not interfere with the anisotropic melt forming capability of the polymers. A non limiting list of these units includesEMI7.3 EMI8.1 EMI8.2 The co polyesters,as mentioned above, may compr ise units I and II in substantially equimolar amounts or may corprise unit III or may comprise a combination of units IsTI, and III, and, of course, more than one kind of unit I,II and or III can be present in the polymer. Preferred co polyesters for use in the invention consist essentially of units I and II.

With each type of polymer, up to 25 mol percent of non conforming units may be present as described above. A list of useful dicarboxylic acids includes,for example, terephthalic acid, 4,4 bibenzoic acid, 4,4 oxydibenzoic acid, 4,4 thiodibenzoic acid, 4 carboxyphenoxyacetic acid, 4,4 trans tilbenedicarboxylic acid, 2,6naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, ethyleneoxy 4,4 dibenzoic acid, isophthalic acid, the halogen and methyl substituted derivatives of the foregoing dicarboxylic acids, 1,4 transcyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, and 2,5 dimethyl 1, 4 transcyclohexanedi carboxylic acid.

Of the co polyesters containing only type III units, there are preferred those which consist essentially of the recurring unitsEMI10.1 1,4 benzoate unit 1,4 cinnamate unit The co polyesters are prepared preferably by melt polycondensation of derivatives of dihydric phenols and aromatic aliphatic, aromatic and cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids or their derivatives. A convenient preparative method is the melt polycondensation of the diacetate cf a dihydric phenol with a dicarboxylic acid. Alternatively, phenolic carboxylic acids or their derivatives, may be used as o reactants in the preparation of polyesters and copolyesters. A list of useful dihydric phenols, preferably used in the form of their diacetate derivatives, includes, for example, hydroquinone, chlorhydroquinone, bromohydroquinone, methylhydroquinone, dimethylhydroquinone, dichlorohydroquinone, dibroohydroquinone,4,4 oxydiphenol, 4,4 isopropylidenedi phenol,4,4 thiodiphenol,4,4 biphenol,3,5,3 ,5 tetramethyl 4,4 bisphenol, 3,5,3 5 tetrachloro 4,4 biphenol,2,6dihydroxynaphthalene, 2, 7 dihydroxynaphthalene, and 4,4 methylenediphe ol, In addition, it is possible to prepare anisotropic polymers by polymerizing methylacryloxy benzoic acid utilizing an alkali metal hydroxide and free radical initiators as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,112,212, 4,130,702,and 4,160,755.

The liquid crystal polymers including wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s which are suitable for use in the present invention may be formed by a variety of ester forming techniques involving reacting organic monomer compounds possessing functional groups which, upon condensation, form the requisite recurring moieties. For instance, the functional groups of the organic monomer compounds may be carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, ester groups,acryoxy groups, acid halides, amine groups,etc. The organic monomer compounds may be reacted in the absence of a heat exchange fluid via a melt acidolysis procedure. They accordingly may be heated initially to form a melt solution of the reactants with the reaction continuing as said polymer particles are suspended therein.A vacuum may be applied to facilitate removal of volatiles formed during the final state of the condensation e.g., acetic acid or water . Our U.S.Patent No. 4,083,829, entitled MeltProcessable Thermotropic Wholly Aromatic Polyester ,describes a slurry polymerization process which may be employed to form the wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention. According to such a process,the solid product is suspended in a heat exchange medium.Although that patent is directed to the preparation of wholly aromatic polyesters, the process may also be employed to form poly ester amide s. When employing either the melt acidolysis or the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829, the organic monomer reactants from which the wholly aromatic polyesters are derived may be initially provided in a modified form whereby the usual hydroxy groups of such monomers are esterified i.e., they are provided as lower acyl esters . The lower acyl groups preferably have from two to four carbon atoms. Preferably, the acetate esters of organic monomer reactants are provided. When poly ester amide s are to be forrr ed, an amine group may be provided as a lower acyl amide. Representative catalysts which optionally may be employed in either the melt acidolysis procedure or in the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829 include dialkyl tin oxide e.g. dibutyl tin oxide , diaryl tin oxide, titanium dixoide, antimony trioxide, alkoxy titanium silicates, titanium alkoxides,alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids e.g. zinc acetate , the gaseous acid catalysts such as Lewis acids e.g. BF3 , hydrogen halides e.g. HC1 , etc. The quantity of catalyst utilized typically is 0.001 to 1 percent by weight based upon the total monomer weight, and most commonly 0.01 to 0.2 percent by weight. The wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s suitable for use in the present invention tend to be substan tally insoluble in common polyester solvents and accordingly are not susceptible to solution processing. As discussed previously, they can be readily processed by common melt processing techniques. Most suitable wholly aromatic polymers are soluble in pentafluorophenol to a limited extent. The wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention commonly exhibit a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 200,000,and preferably 10,000 to 50,000, and most preferably 20,000 to 25,000. The wholly aromatic poly ester amide s which are preferred for use in the present invention commonly exhibit a molecular weight of 5,000 to 50,000, and preferably 10,000 to 30,000 e.g., 15,000 to 17,000. Such molecular weight may be determinded by gel permeation chromatography and other standard techniques not involving the dissolving of the polymer,e.g.by end group determination via infrared spectroscopy on compression molded films. Alternatively, light scattering techniques in a pentafluorophenol solution may be employed to determine the molecular weight. The wholly aromatic polyesters and poly esteramide s commonly exhibit an inherent viscosity I.V. of at least 2.0 dl. g.,e.g.,2.0 to 10.0 dl. g.,when dissolved at a concentration of 0,1 percent by weight in petafluoro phenol at 600C. For the purposes of the present invention, the aromatic rings which are included in the polymer backbones of the polymer components may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring. Such substituents include alkyl groups of up to four carbon atoms alkoxy groups having up to four carbon atoms halogens and additional aromatic rings, such as phenyl and substituted phenyl. Preferred halogens include fluorine, chlorine and bromine. Although bromine atoms tend to be released from organic compounds at high temperatures, bromine is more stable on aromatic rings than on aliphatic chains, and therefore suitable for inclusion as a possible substituent on the aromatic rings. It is emphasized that an important aspect of the present invention which complements the concept of substantially uniform distribution of intermixed fibers is the combination of compatible thermoplastic materials with nonthermoplastic materials or materials having a sufficiently high melting temperature, whereupon effective bonding and integration can be achieved by application of heat and pressure sufficient to melt the thermoplastic material but not sufficient to melt the reinforcing material. Thus,the use of relatively high melting thermoplastic materials as reinforcing fibers is contemplated in the present invention, and such materials are referred to as non thermoplastic throughout the specification and claims for the sake of brevity. The reinforcing fibers useful herein are metallic or ceramic, amorphous, polycrystalline or single crystal reinforcing fibers of filaments. Common examples are carbon, glass, boron and boron nitride, ceramic fibers, such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride and alumina, aramides, and ordered polymers. The use of carbon fibers as reinforced fibers is specifically described and claimed in our co pendingEuropean application based on United States serial nos. 589,817, 589,823 and 589,825. The glass fibers utilized are manufactured and marketed commercially. The fibers are drawn from a molten supply of glass contained in a platinum container having a large plurality of very fine holes in the bottom thereof from which the molten glass is drawn at high rates of speed which attenuate the glass into extremely fine diameter. The glass filaments are pretreated as drawn from the platinum container, usually called a bushing with a size serving to enhance the compatability of the ultimate glass yarn with the thermoplastic fiber which is utilized. The glass fibers contemplated are continuous glass fibers in the form of unstranded filaments,strandedglass filaments,untwisted bundles of stranded glass filaments including twistless roving all hereinafter referred to as glass fibers. Size compositions are contemplated herein and those preferred for use in the practice of the present invention are those conventionally used in the treatment of glass fibers. Such size compositions contain, as the essential component, a glass fiber anchoring agent such as an organo silicon compound or a Werner complex compound. Preferred anchoring agents are the amino silanes, such as gamma aminopropyltriethoxy silane or N betaaminoethyl gamma aminopropyltriethoxy silane. However, use can also be made of any of the organo silanes as well as the corresponding silanols and polysiloxanes. Representative of other suitable anchoring agents which can be used in the practice of this invention are the organo silicons and their hydrolysis products and polymerization products polysiloxane . Instead of organo silicon as described above,use can also be made of Werner complex compounds containing a carboxylato group coordinated with the trivalent nuclear chromic atoms, and in which the carboxylato group may also contain an amino group or an epoxy group. Suitable Werner complex compounds include stearato chromic chloride,methacrylato chromic chloride, aminopropylato chromic chloride, glycine chromic complex or glyclato chromic chloride. Ceramic fibers contemplated for use herein include silicon carbide composed of ultrafine beta SiC crystals , silicon nitride Si3N4 and alumina A1203 fibers. Any silicon carbide fiber system with the requisite strength can be used, although a multi filament silicon carbide yarn with an average filament diameter up to 50 microns is preferred and yarn with average filament diameter of 5 to 15 microns is especially preferred. If a silicon carbide monofilament is used, a typical silicon carbide monofilament of approximately 140 microns diameter is available from AVCO Systems Divisions, Lowell, Mass. This fiber exhibits an average tensile strength of up to 3450 MPa, has a temperature capability of over 13000C. and is stable in oxidizing environments. Alumina fibers have been available for several years. They have been of particular interest for application in metal matrix composites because of their excellent strength and modulus, especially at high temperature. At first, the two principal types of alumina fiber were the large diameter 350P single crystal rods or alumina whiskers. The problems of handling and processing whiskers and the very high cost of the single crystal fiber dampened the enthusiasm for their use in composites. The situation changed, however, with the advent of high quality alumina yarns uhich,because of their low potential cost and attractive mechanical properties, could be seriously considered for use in composites. In general, these fibers are produced by E.I. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and 3M Corporation in theUSA and Sumitomo Chemicals Co.in Japan. The DuPont fiber,referred to as fiber FP, is a round cross section, 20 cm diameter, continuous length yarn having 210 fibers per tow. It is available in two forms.Type I is pure alpha alumina while Type II is similar but coated with a thin layer of glass. Type II was originally intended for resin matrix composites and Type I for metal matrix composites however, it is found by this invention that both are suitable for ceramic composites. Although the initial fiber strength is not particularly high, of the order of 1380 MPA 200,000 psi , it is very important to note that this strength is stable and not affected by handling and is not very different from that realized in composites reinforced with alumina rods of initially higher unhandled pristine strength. The Sumitomo Chemicals fiber is also produced in yarn form however, there the similarity with fiber FP ends.This fiber is not pure alumina and, in fact, it is the presence of some SiO2 and a very fine structure which permit a claimed use temperature to be 13500C. On the basis of specific mechanical properties this fiber is attractive. Its low density and high tensile strength provide a specific strength nearly twice that of fiber FP while the specific modulus approximately equals the FP property. The Sumitomo fiber appears to have superior handleability. The known properties of boron nitride, properties such as exceptionally high heat resistance 18000F. in oxidizing 50000F. in reducing atmospheres ,dielectric strength 950 v. mil , high surface and volume resistivity and low dissipation factor over a wide temperature range, make it potentially attractive high temperature reinforcing fiber candidate. The fibers may vary in diameter, although those preferred are about 10 microns in diameter and fibers having diameters up to 30 microns may be used. Continuous boron nitride fibers 99 boron nitride are available commercially from the Carborundum Corporation. The reinforcing fibers which are particularly useful herein have bundle or tow deniers in the range of from 1 to 100,000 and filament counts of from 300 to 300,000, preferably deniers of 1000 to 16,000 and filament counts of 3,000 to 24,000. The fibers also should exhibit a tensile strength of at least 100,000 psi 689 000 kPa and a tensile modulus of 10 to 120 x 106 psi 68.9 to 826.8 x 106 kPa . The thermoplastic fibers which are particularly useful herein have bundle cross sectional areas ranging from twice that of the reinforcing fiber tows to half that of the reinforcing fiber tow. Bundle or tow denier will be in the range of 1 to 50 and the fiber count will depend upon single filament denier higher counts are required with lower denier filaments . However, in general, from 10 to 150,000 filaments, preferably 100 to 10,000 filaments, are employed.The modulus of the fiber should be in the range of 50,000 to 500,000 psi 344500 to 3445000 kPa . The thermoplastic fiber should also exhibit a melting point which is at least 500F 280C , preferably at least 2000F 1110C , above ambient temperatures. And of course, the fiber should melt and fuse at temperatures no higher than 1,0000F 5380C , preferably no higher than 8000F 4270C , in order to be useful herein. The weight ratio of the two fibers which are intermixed can vary widely. However, in order to prepare satisfactory composites, it is necessary that sufficient thermoplastic polymer fiber be employed to obtain complete wetting of the reinforcing fibers. Generally, no less than 30 percent, by volume, of the thermoplastic polymer fibers ray be employed. The maximum amount of thermoplastic polymer depends upon the strength properties which are required. In general, when less than ten percent, by plume of the reinforcing fiber is present, the resulting composite products have strength and stiffness properties which are poor in relation te products containing higher amounts of reinforcing fibers and exhibit little or no improvement over unreinforced matrices.Preferably 20 to 60 percent, by volume, of the reinforcing fiber materials should be present in the combined tow. In addition to the reinforcing fiber and the thermoplastic fibers which are used herein, it is contem lated to add carbon fibers to the fiber blends of the invention as reinforcing fibers. In the event additional carbon fibers are added, it is possible to reduce the amount of the reinforcing fiber which is used to as low as 10 volume percent. However, the maximum combined amount of the added carbon fiber plus the amount of the reinforcing fiber which is employed should not exceed the upper limit specified above for the reinforcing fiber alone. In Figure 1 of the drawings, a reinforcing fiber tow 1 is obtained having the properties specified above.The fibbers from the reinforcing fiber tow are passed through a fiber c i 3 and onto a first Godet roll 4 . The first Gs,dei rll is synchronized with a second Godet roll 11 at rates of speed such that the second Godet roll revolves slightly slower than the first Godet roll. Hence, the fibers between the two Godet rolls, which are subsequently spread and intermixed during the process of the invention remain in a low tensioned approaching tension free state which provides for effective fiber intermixing. Individual thermoplastic polymer fibers, such as polybutylene terephthalate fibers, are mounted on a bobbin rack 2 and the fibers are fed through a fiber guide 3 onto the firstGodet roll 4 .A tension comb may be employed after the fibers leave the bobbin and before they are brought into contact with the Godet roll. This tension comb serves to improve the contact of the fiber with the Godet roll and to increase the width of the fiber tow. At this point in the process neither the reinforcing fibers nor the thermoplastic fibers are intermixed or are in contact. Rather, both are wrapped separately around the first Godet roll 4 to provide tension control.After leaving the Godet roll, the individual fibers separately pass through a fiber guide 5 to maintain directional control. After leaving the fiber guide 5 , the thermoplastic polymer fibers pass through a fiber comb 6 .The fiber comb having a plurality of spaced apart fingers acts to maintain as separate the various fine yarns of the thermoplastic polymeric fiber so as to preserve separation of the individual fibers. The reinforcement fibers, on the other hand, after leaving the fiber guide 5 , are directed into a gas banding jet 7 . The gas banding jets showing In FIGS. 3 and 4 is used to uniformly spread the fiber tows. A gas banding jet can also be used as an intermixing means whereby the gas jet serves to uniformly intermix the two fiber tows. The banding jet consists of a gas box 40 into which compressed air or another gas is fed through a conventional adjustable gas metering means 41 . The preferred pressure of gas flow into the gas jet is in the range of 0.5 to 10 psi 3.45 to 68.9 kPa . One or more than one, gas exit ports 44 are provided to cause gas from within the gas box to impinge in a generally perpendicular fashion upon the fiber tow which passes across the exit ports. Preferably, the exit ports are V shaped and pointed in the direction of movement of the fiber tow across the box. As shown in FIG.4, the gas banding jet is provided with shims 46 or other means to allow a gas box cover 48 to be attached,so that a flow channel for the fibers is provided. The gas box cover is held in place by convenient attachment means, such as clamps 49 . In an alternative process shown in FIG.2 both the thermoplastic fiber and the reinforcing fiber are subject to gas banding Jet treatment 26 and 27 . However, particularly with lower molecule weight, less high melting polymers, such as polybutylene terephthalate, a fiber comb having a plurality of spaced apart fingers, as described above, may be employed in place of the banding jet. After the fibers are spread by banding jets or banding jets in combination with combs, they are intermixed using an intermixing means 8 . In FIG.1 the intermixing means is a pair of stationary rods or bars. The fibers from the spread reinforcement fiber tow and the fibers from the spread thermoplastic tow or yarns both initially come into contact together on the bottom of the first stationary rod or bar. The fibers then are deflected across the top of the second stationary bar or rod and, as a result, are intermixed. In order to ensure complete intermixing, it is necessary that both fibers be uniformly spread across their entire width and that the area within which both fibers are spread be virtually identical. Finally, it is necessary that intermixing be undertaken in a relatively tension free state.If high tension is imparted to either of the fiber tows,full or optimal intermixing may not occur. After passing over and under the stationary bars, the combined fiber tow may be further intermixed using an air entanglement jet as described above. After intermixing, the fibers pass through a comb 9 to maintain dimensional stability and through twist guides 10 to impart a slight twist to the intermixed fibers.The twist is imparted in order to maintain the intermixing of the fibers. Instead of using an actual half twist, false twisting of the fibers using methods well known in the art may be employed. In the alternative, a fiber wrap may be used to hold the intermixed fibers together. The overwrap may be of any convenient type of fiber. However,it is preferred that the overwrap consist of a relatively small quantity of thermoplastic fibers. The mixed fibers are then wrapped around a secondGodet roll 11 which, as pointed out above, serves in conjunction with the first Godet roll to provide a relatively tension free zone to allow fiber intermixing. The fibers are then taken up by a take up roll 12 for storage. Of course, it is possible to impart false twisting or actual twisting or to wrap the fiber tow with another fiber either before or after the Godet roll. In addition, the intermixed fibers may be made stable by application of an appropriate fiber finish which serves to hold the intermixed fibers together and enable easier handling in subsequent operations, such as weaving. FIG.2 is similar to FIG.1 but is the process most preferred when a liquid crystal type of polymer or other higher melting point polymer is used. In FIG.2 a roll of reinforcing filamentary material 21 feeds fiber through tension comb 22 and onto Godet roll 25 . Liquid crystal fibers from a roll 23 are fed through a guide 24 and onto the same Godet roll 25 . Separation is maintained between both fibers on the Godet roll. As pointed out above, the first Godet roll 25 , when used in combination with the optional second Godet roll 35 , serves to maintain the fibers in a relatively tension free state during the intermixing process. High tension during intermixing must be avoided to assure that complete intermixing occurs. After the reinforcing fibers and the liquid crystal fibers leave the first Godet roll they are both fed into gas banding jets 26 and G27 through guides 28 and 29 , respectively. In the gas banding jet the fibers are spread to a uniform width. The fibers then pass through a second set of fiber guides 30 and 31 and are intermixed using stationary,longitudinally extended bars shown at 32 . In general, intermixing occurs as the thermoplastic bundle is fed onto the same bar in the same areas as is the reinforcement fiber. At this point in the processing, the width of both tows is the same, and as they are brought simultaneously into contact with the same area of the bar, intimate intermixing occurs.In an alternative intermixing process, the two fiber tows are fed simultaneously into a gas jet or other gaseous intermixing device in a relatively tensionfree state. In addition, the fibers may be fed into a gas jet for further intermixing after they have been treated on the stationary bars. In the gas intermixing means a jet of air impinges on the fibers, preferably perpendicular to their direction of flow. Following intermixing, the fibers are fed through twist guides 33 to add at least a half twist per yard to the fiber to ensure dimensional stability. Fibers then pass through a guide 34 onto a second Godet roll 35 and from there onto a take up roll 36 . In use, the intermixed fibers may be filament wound, or otherwise assembled and placed on a mold, and heated under pressure to the flow temperature of the thermoplastic polymer to form composite articles which are useful in a variety of end uses where high strength, high stiffness and low weight are essential. For example, the composites formed from products prepared according to this invention may be used in forming spacecraft, airplane or automobile structural components. In addition, the reinforced fiber blends of the instant invention find particular utility in those end uses where complex, three dimensional shapes are involved. As pointed out above, the compositions of the instant invention are particularly useful where there is a small radius of curvature requiring substantial bending and shaping cf the compositions of the instant invention.The only limiting factor in forming reinforced fiber shaped articles using the compositions of the instant invention is the bendabiiity of the reinforcing fiber itself. Therefore, utilizing the compositions of the invention, it is possible to prepare materials having a minimum radius of curvature of 0.002 in 0.05 mm , preferably as low as 0.003 in. 0.08 mm . However, with prior art thermoplastic tapes, the minimum radius of curvature is about 0.005 in. 0.13 mm . Even then fiber directionality or alignment is distorted. As structural elements formed from the fiber tows of this invention are heated under pressure above the melting point 6f the thermoplastic fiber, these fibers melt and fuse the fibers together forming a consolidated composite product containing well dispersed reinforcing fibers.Using the fiber blends of the instant invention, it is possible to prepare recreational articles, such as tennis racquet frames, racquetball racquet frames, hockey sticks, ski poles, fishing rods and golf club shafts. The fibers of the invention find particular utility in filament winding applications. As pointed out above, in the prior art it was extremely difficult to prepare composite articles utilizing the prior art fiber tapes.These tapes, which are prepared on an extremely large scale, are difficult to handle on a small scale, and it is particularly difficult to form them into intricately shaped articles. While the prior art employed the filament winding process with success, this process was limited to use of reinforcing fibers in combination with thermosetting resins if long, thin rods were to be prepared. In the prior art process, the reinforcing fiber was wound onto a mold after applying a thermosetting coating or coated with the thermosetting material after winding. As a result, however, it was often difficult for the thermosetting material actually to penetrate and or achieve good wetting of closely wound products. Utilizing the process of the invention in a modified filament winding procedure, it is possible to prepare intricately shape d articles when the fiter blends are oriented in directions not parallel to the long axis of the article, utilizing thermoplastic polymers in conjunction with fiber reinforcements. This modified filament winding process begins with the use of the intermixed tows of the invention. These tows may be fed directly to a filament winder. As the filament winder moves around or up and down the mandrel or form, the reinforcement fiber thermoplastic fiber tow is applied directly to the mold and heated using a radiant heater or other suitable means for immediately melting and fusing the thermoplastic polymeric fibers within the reinforcing fiber tow.In other words, the reinforcing fiber thermoplastic fiber tow should be heated under pressure as soon as or soon after it meets the mandrel. After full melting and resolidification occurs, the mandrel either may be dissolved using a suitable solvent, may be pulled from the product, or the mandrel may actually become a part of the product. Another unique use for the fiber blends prepared according to the invention is in forming woven fabrics utilizing standard techniques. According to this process, the tow of the instant invention is used either alone or in combination with other tows or fibers to form a woven mat.The woven fabrics prepared according to the process of this invention may be applied to the desired mold or otherwise used in forming a composite. The previous method of choice of forrt rg such materials involved laying down a layer of reinforcing fibers, e.g. glass fibers, followed by a layer of thermoplastic film, followed by another layer of glass, etc. Now the materials can be combined in a solid woven layer and much more readily applied to a mold. After the composite is formed, it is then heated under pressure above the flow point of the thermoplastic polymer, and a composite having good mechanical strength and stiffness properties results. The strength and stiffness enhancement can occur in one or more directions, i.e., those directions along which reinforcement fiber is aligned parallel to the defining vector. EXAMPLE 1 A liquid crystal polymeric LCP fiber tow based upon a copolymer prepared from 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid and p hydroxy benzoic acid is obtained. The LCP has a density of 1.4 g cc, and the tow itself is formed of 660 filaments 2.25 denier per filament . The tow had an initial modulus of 5670 gms, a tenacity of 10.5 g denier, and an elongation of 2 . The second fiber to be used for intermixing with the LCP fiber is E glass fiber 204 filament count designated as ECG 150 1 0 , having a density of 2.55 g cc, a tensile strength of 300,nDn psi 2067000 kPa ,a tensile modulus of 10,500,000 psi 72345000 kPa and an ultimate elongation of 2.8 . The glass fiber is available from both PPG Industries and OCF. Bobbins containing the LCP polymeric fiber tow and the glass fiber tow are spaced apart on a bobbin rack.Fibers from both bobbins are fed onto and separately wrapped around a Godet roll, so that upon mixing the mixed tow contains approximately 50 by volume of liquid crystal polyner and approximately 50 by volume of glass. The LCP polymeric fiber is subject to a 50 gram weight on a tensioning device prior to being wrapped around the Godet roll, in order to maintain smooth tracking on the roll. After leaving theGodet roll, both fibers are separately subjected to air jet banding treatments utilizing an air jet which impinges air approximately perpendicular to the fiber through V shaped nozzles. The jet for the liquid crystal polymer is operated at 5 psi 34.45 kPa , while the glass fiber jet was operated at 4 psi 27.56 kPa .After leaving the banding jets, the fibers are brought together over the top and underneath of two parallel,longitudinally extended, staggered stationary bars and are fed through fiber guides into an entanglement jet, which is similar in design to the gas banding jet and operated at a gas pressure of 7 psi 48.23 kPa . Following initmate intermixing of the two tows, the fibers are taken up on a take up roll at a take up speed of 7 8 m min. The composite panels 3.5 x 10 90 x 250 mm are prepared using 20 layers of the intermixed fiber tow. Each layer is prepared by first wrapping a heated drum with a Kapton film and then filament winding parallel rows on the fiber blend prepared above onto the Kapton wrapped drum.A layer of Kapton film is then placed over the drum, and the entire wrapped drum is heated so as to temporarily fuse the fibers together. The composite containing the 20 fused layers is placed in a pressure mold, heated to about 3150C. anc held at this temperature for five minutes without application of significant mold pressure. The mold pressure is then increased to 500 psi 3445 kPa and held at about 31 temperature and under such increased pressure for thirty minutes. The material is then cooled at 700C. and removed fro the mold. The resulting material contains about 50 by olume of E glass fiber and has a panel thickness of about 0.103 2.62 mm . Utilizing the same process, a six ply 3.5 x 10 9C x 250 mm composite panel is prepared having a glass fiber volume of about 60 , a panel thickness of about 0.035 0.89 mm . The composites are evaluated and exhibit excellent tensile, flexural and compression properties. EXAMPLE 2 Utilizing the same glass fiber as described inExample 1, an approximate 50 by volume polybutylene terephthalate PBT glass fiber blend is prepared. The polybutylene terephthalate material has a density of 1.34 g cc and a denier of 1520 g 9000m. The polybutylene terephthalate has a draw ratio of 2.25 1, an initial modulus of 24 g, a tenacity of 5.3 g denier, an elgonation of 28 , a melting point of 2270C. and a denier per filament of 2.7. Ten packages of 33 filament count yarn are employed on a creel, and all packages are merged into a single polybutylene terephthalate fiber tow on a Godet roll. Maintained separately, but on the same Godet roll, ten packages of 408 filament count glass fiber Type ECK 75 2 1 to provide a total approximate blend of 50 50 by volume glass fiber PBT. The polybutylene terephthalate tow is fed through a fiber comb having approx imately 30 teeth, while the glass fiber tow is fed through a gas banding jet operating as described in Example 1, at a pressure of 2.5 to 3.5 psi 17.23 to 24.12 kPa . The two tows are then intermixed over and under parallel extending rods by feeding both tows into the same area on the bars. Intermixing is aided by the use of a second gas banding jet of the type described in Example 1, operating at 2.5 to 3.5 psi 17.23 to 24.12 kPa . After leaving the banding jet, the fibers are fed through a second fiber comb which was arranged parallel to the direction of flow of the fiber, so as to provide a tensioning path to aid in intermixing. After leaving the comb, the fibers are fed through twist guides to provide approximately a half twist per yard per 0.9 m , so as to maintain the fibers in their intermixed state. The fibers are then wrapped around a second Godet roll and taken up at a speed of 7 8 m min. In order to minimize tension during the intermixing process, the second Godet roll is operated at a slightly lower speed than the first Godet roll. 3.5 x 10 90 x 250 mm panel composites are prepared generally as described in Example 1 and evaluated satisfactorily. A sample of the PBT glass fiber blend prepared above is wrapped with 90 denier polybutylene terephthalate yarn as described above at four wraps per in per 2.5 cm to form a compact yarn suitable for fabric weaving. ThePBT fabric wrap is chosen, so that it would form a part of the matrix upon composite fabrication. The resulting wrapped yarn is then divided into 96 different yarn segments and placed on spools mounted on a special creel. A 6 152 mm wide fabric is then woven on a modified Draper XD loom, using a plain weave pattern. The resulting woven product has dimensions of 16 ends per inch per 25.4 mm x 15 picks per inch per 25.4 mm and weighs ca. 0.05 oz. yd2 17 g m2 .The fabric is ca.10 mils 0.25 mm in thickness, is soft but compact, and exhibits good dimensional stability. Satisfactory fiber composites having irregular shapes are prepared fro the resulting fabric. EXAMPLE 3 An approximate 50 50 by volume blend is prepared based upon the glass fiber described in Example 1 and a polyether ether ketone PEEK thermoplastic polymer. The fiber prepared from the PEEK has a density of 1.3 g cc, a melting point of 3380C., an initial modulus of 53 grams,a tenacity of 2.7 g denier, an elongation of 65 , and in 10 filaments per package tows a dpf of 367 g 9000m . Four 10 filaments per package tows are placed on a creel and the fibers are blended together on a Godet roll, but maintained separately from the glass fiber which is also wrapped around the Godet roll. The PEEK fiber is then directed through a fiber comb as described in Example 2 and into a gas banding jet. The glass fiber after leaving the Godet roll also enters a gas banding jet. Both jets are operating at a pressure of about 3 psi 20.7 kPa . After leaving the jets the fibers are intermixed above and below two parallel, longitudinally extended rods and are fed through a second parallel fiber comb, twisted to maintain dimensional stability, fed over a second Godet roll and taken up at a speed of 7 10 m min. A satisfactory composition results.
