# Surge stall cessation detection system.

## Abstract
The cessation of stall surge in the compressor of a twin spool gas turbine engine is detected by comparing by digital electronics and engines sensed burner pressure with a burner pressure calculated from corrected low pressure compressor speed and sensed airplane Mach number which has been compensated to approximate engine dynamics.
