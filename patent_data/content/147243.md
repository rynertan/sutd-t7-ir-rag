# Injection moulding and casting method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a simplified method of injection moulding or casting by forcing a solid bar 7 of the material to be moulded or cast as a plunger into a closed heating chamber 3 which is maintained at a temperature above the melting or plasticizing temperature of the moulding or casting material. The leading end of the bar 7 as it enters the heating chamber melts or plasticizes therein and displaces molten or plasticized material from the chamber 3 through a discharge opening 4 in the chamber so that the bar of moulding or casting material acts as its own pump.
