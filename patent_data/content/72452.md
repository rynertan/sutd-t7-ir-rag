# Flange structure for plastic container.

## Abstract
A container 10 having a novel flange configuration is disclosed that may be readily rolled with a closure 11 to form an interlocking double seam to provide a leakproof container. The flange configuration may be readily interlock ed due to its flexibility and resiliency with a closure 11 without the flange 16 being distorted, fractured or cracked. The container 10 includes a peripheral flange 16 con nected to and surrounding the opening 17 of the container, the flange 16 having a channel 19 adjacent the sidewall 12 and a complementary bead 20 associated therewith. In one embodiment, the container 10 is made of a thermoplas tic material comprising a plurality of superimposed layers, one of which is yieldable, so that when the flange is interfolded the yieldable material is forced outwardly to fill any voids that exist between the flange and closure to form a complete and flexible seal.
