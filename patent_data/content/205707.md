# Method of continuously vulcanizing hoses.

## Abstract
A method of continuously vulcanizing hoses comprises initial vulcanization using microwaves followed by conven tional vulcanization by means of heat conduction of heating medium. A layer of heat resistant synthetic resin 15 is provided over the outer periphery of a rubber hose in a uniform thickness using an extruder 23 . The layer 15 is in close contact with the hose but not adherent thereto. The layer 15 has a low microwave absorption loss and a melt ing point higher than the vulcanizing temperature of the rubber. After the resin layer is cooled and hardened in a cooling tank 24 , the rubber hose is heated and cured in a microwave vulcanizing tank 25 before being subjected to vulcanization by heat conduction of a heating medium in an ordinary vulcanizing tank 26 for a given period of time. After vulcanization has been completed, the layer 15 is peeled off and removed from the hose.
