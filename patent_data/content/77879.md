# Process and apparatus for checking the interlayer slip condition of a reel wound web.

## Abstract
A reel to reel magnetic tape drive includes a motor 14 for a tape supply reel 16 in a cartridge 16A . The free end of the tape 28 wound on the reel 16 has a leader block 29 to prevent its entry into the cartridge. For transducing pur poses, the leader block is drawn along a tape path 27 and secured to a take up reel 24 driven by a motor 22 . The motors have tachometers 12 and 20 providing signals to a controller 10 . Reels of magnetic tape for use in the reel to reel drive may suffer from inter layer slip, if the reel has gone through environmental changes. This slip will cause errors to occur in the reading of the tape, because a constant tension and velocity and an accurate position is required in the reel to reel drive. To check whether the tension of the tape needs to be refreshed, the end of the tape is firmly held while the reel is driven in a reverse direction against the firmly held end of the tape. A detected reverse rotation indicates an interlayer slip condition. The tape tension is then refreshed by unreeling the tape and rereeling with the correct tension applied. The reel of tape is then ready for operation.
