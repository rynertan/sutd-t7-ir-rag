# Electrical connector for a coaxial cable.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 60 is disclosed of the type to which a coaxial cable 22 having a braided conductor layer 26 is adapted to be clamped to establish electrical and mechanical connections, characterized by a simplified cable clamping means. The clamping means includes an outer contact clamping body 72 formed with a clamping cone 112 integral with an outer contact portion 68 . In preferred embodiments, the contact clamping body 72 is engagable to be held against rotation by flats 94 formed on the outside diameter of an intermediate section 93 thereof, connector coupling sleeve 62 movable into mating engagement therewith, and to be retracted to allow the coupling sleeve 62 to be rotatable during coupling with a mating connector.
