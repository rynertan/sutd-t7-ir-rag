## Description
In the art of pumping liquids it is frequently desirable to provide precise flow rates. A comparatively recent application of pumps is for the controlled flow of medication into humans or animals for the treatment of a variety of physiologic dys functions or disease. These medication pumps are being used both externally to the living body, as well as implanted within the living body. With the acceptance of both external and implantable infusion devices, researchers have been attempting to develop a pump which satisfies the strict performance requirements imposed on these devices. It can be seen from an article written by W. J. Spencer entitled A Review of Programmed Infusion Delivery Systems IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Vol. BME 28, No. 3, March 1981 that the ideal pump would provide uniform delivery of medication in a reliable and reproducible manner with a minimum of power, weight, and volume. In an effort to meet these requirements the above referenced article points out that current researchers are experimenting with syringe, peristaltic, piezoelectric and bellows type pumps. The bellows or positive displacement pump appears to be an attractive type of pump for infusion devices. U.S. A 4,265,241 discloses a bellows pump consisting of a piston bellows which is actuated by a solenoid controlled armature. Movement of the piston bellows tends to increase or decrease the volume of the pumping chamber. When the volume of the pump chamber is a maximum, medication is forced from a reservoir, which is maintained at positive pressure, through an input check valve into the pump chamber. When the bellows piston is actuated, the pump chamber is at a minimum volume and fluid is forced out of the chamber through an output check valve. U.S. A 4,373,527 describes a bellows pump which uses the pumping action of the bellows to draw medication from a reservoir through an input check valve and into the pump chamber. When the bellows is extended by a solenoid, medication in the pumping chamber is forced from the pumping chamber via an output check valve. Similarly, U.S. A 4,360,019 describes a positive displacement pump which uses an elastometric diaphragm which is driven by a solenoid via a plunger. Movement of a diaphragm varies the volume in the pump chamber which causes fluid to flow into the chamber via a spring loaded input valve or to flow from the chamber via a spring loaded output valve. U.S. A 4,152,098 discloses a pump having a diaphragm which forms the inlet valve, outlet valve, and is the movable member which varies the volume in the pumping chamber. A solenoid actuated ball is driven in contact with the diaphragm to vary the volume in the pumping chamber. Although the diaphragm remains in conformity with the ball, differential pressure across the input valve will cause the stroke volume of this prior art pump to vary. U.S. A 2,474,349 discloses a fuel pump having a cylindrical piston with an axial passage therein which piston reciprocates within a cylinder and is driven by means of an armature and a magnetic coil. During each downwardly directed stroke a check valve member mounted at the upper end of the cylinder is opened to allow fluid flow from a reservoir to reach above the check valve. During the subsequent upwardly directed stroke this fluid is trapped and ejected from the pump through an outlet fitting. Several of the above cited references teach the use of a compliant diaphragm or bellows which result in variations in pump stroke volume with changes in the reservoir pressure or in ambient pressure conditions. Variations in reservoir or ambient pressure conditions will cause the diaphragm or the bellows to be deformed such that variations between the actuation and rest volumes of the pump chamber can vary considerably. Similarly, all of the above cited references teach the use of input and output valves. Since the flow rate through the valve depends upon differential pressure across the valve, the flow rate through the input valve and therefore the stroke volume is dependent upon ambient pressure and reservoir pressure. Therefore, the prior art research and experimentation with various types of pumps has not provided a positive displacement pump which has a constant stroke volume and which is independent of ambient and reservoir pressures. Prior research also indicates that bellows, or positive displacement pumps, are inoperable if bubbles enter the pumping chamber. If a large enough bubble enters the pumping chamber it will stop the pumping of an incompressible liquid because the gas can compress fully before sufficient pressure is generated to open the inlet and or outlet valves. Prior art references such as U.S. A 4,191,181 attempts to solve this problem by using a wicklike member composed of lightly packed glass like fibers which have sufficient capillary forces to prevent gas from entering the fine channels. Similarly, U.S. A 4,360,019, referenced earlier, attempts to solve this problem by using a looped tube that terminates a short distance from the side of the straight portion of the tube. This distance is smaller than the diameter of air bubbles, thus blocking their entry into the tube. However, the difficulty with these prior art techniques is that particulates formed in the reservoir chamber can block the filter or wick after a period of operation and thereby block medication delivery. It is an object of the invention to overcome the above outlined difficulties and to provide for a positive displacement pump which can deliver precise and constant stroke volumes with preventing gas bubbles from entering into the pumping chamber. To solve such problem a positive displacement pump is provided, which comprises a pump chamber, a passageway providing fluid communication between said pump chamber and a source of liquid to be pumped, an output valve and conduit in fluid communication with said pump chamber, and a variable volume means for increasing the volume of said pump chamber during an intake stroke for decreasing the volume of said pump chamber during an output stroke, wherein liquid is drawn through said passageway into said pump chamber during said intake stroke and wherein liquid is expelled from said pump chamber through said output valve and conduit during said output stroke, which positive displacement pump is characterized in that said passageway provides bi directional fluid communication between said pump chamber and said source of liquid to be pumped, that an inlet filter means having a very high resistance to flow and a flow resistance characteristic which is identical for both inflow and outflow is positioned in said passageway for permitting filling of said pump chamber at a first, comparatively slow rate during said intake stroke and cooperates with said variable volume means for generating sufficient fluid pressure in said pump chamber during the subsequent output stroke which is rapid compared to said intake stroke to open said output valve and eject a substantial volume of liquid from said pump chamber, and that said inlet filter means has sufficiently small pore size to prevent bubbles of gas from entering said pump chamber. By eliminating the inlet check valve of the prior art pumps, in which the differential pressure across the input valve caused variations in stroke volume, and providing for the inlet filter means the differential flow problem is overcome and a more constant stroke volume achieved. The input filter means has the additional advantage of blocking gas bubbles from entering the pumping chamber. U.S. A 3,168, 111 discloses the use of a porous element in a throttle valve by which porous element rapid flow of fluid is prevented. However, the overall structure of the prior art throttle valve does not have any similarities with a positive displacement pump according to the invention. The variable volume means in the positive displacement pump according to the invention may comprise a diaphragm defining a boundary of the pump chamber, means for moving the diaphragm from a rest position wherein said pump chamber has a maximum volume to an actuation position wherein said pump chamber has a minimum volume, and a means for returning the diaphragm to the rest position. The pump may comprise a housing having a first wall and a second wall with the diaphragm conforming to the contour of the first wall when in the rest position and conforming to the contour of the second wall when in the actuatiion position. Thereby in the rest position the pump chamber will have a constant maximum volume regardless of reservoir ambient pressure. In the actuation position the pump chamber will have a certain minimum volume regardless of ambient or reservoir pressure. The means for moving may further comprise a solenoid coil for providing a magnetic field in response to a current pulse and an armature means mechanically coupled to the diaphragm for moving the diaphragm from the rest position to the actuation position inresponse to the magnetic field. In order that the present invention may be more fully understood, it will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which The improvements of the present invention are best explained with the aid of Figure 1 which shows a conventional prior art diaphragm pump as might be used in an implantable medication infusion system. The pump diaphragm is actuated by a solenoid not shown connected to a cylinder, which is shown in its normal rest down position at 10 The reservoir 20 in Fig. 1 has a metallic diaphragm shown in its empty position at 38 Another reason the prior art pumps have higher stroke volume at higher reservoir pressures is a result of the inlet and outlet valves having fairly high flow resistances. Particularly, this is because they are open for extremely short times 1 ms which is associated with high flow rates and comparatively high flow resistance. Therefore, when the pressure in the reservoir is higher, for the same pressure in the exit tube 24, we will get a higher differential pressure across the valves causing a greater flow rate across the comparatively high flow resistance of the valves and therefore a higher pump stroke volume. Similarly, at lower reservoir pressures, the stroke volume will be less. Thus the curve of Fig. 2 shows typical stroke volume variations for this type of prior art pump. Figure 3 contains a curve which illustrates the effect of ambient pressure on stroke volume for such prior art pumps. When ambient pressure is increased, the pressure in the exit tube 24 is increased and the diaphragm at 12 Also, the flow rate through the inlet and outlet valves, which depends on differential pressure, will vary with changes in ambient pressure. Thus higher ambient pressure at a constant reservoir pressure will result in a differential pressure across the outlet valve 22 and, therefore, lower flow rates through the valve 22 and, therefore, lower stroke volume as seen in Fig. 3. Conversely, lower ambient pressures lead to higher differential pressure across the outlet valve 22 and, therefore, a higher stroke volume. For the typical prior art, two valve, diaphragm pump illustrated in Fig. 1, any bubble that enters the reservoir can enter the pump. If a large enough bubble enters the pump, it will stop the pumping of the incompressible liquid because the gas can compress fully before sufficient pressure is generated to open the inlet and or the outlet valve s . This condition is highly undesirable if the pump is implanted in humans. Since the valves in prior art Fig. 1 have a significant length, the overall height of the pump is comparatively great, resulting in an undesirable increase in thickness of the implanted pump. Figures 4 and 5 show a specific embodiment of a single valve diaphragm pump as taught by the present invention with Figure 4 representing the rest position and Figure 5 representing the actuation position. This pump offers several operating advantages when compared to the prior art two valve pump shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 4, a magnetic solenoid consisting of a magnetic core 44 has contained within its cylindrical structure a solenoid coil 46 with lead out wires 48. When a pulse of electrical current goes through the coil 46 via the lead out wires 48, then the magnetic core 44 is magnetized and the magnetic armatures goes from its normal rest position 50 Unlike the prior art solenoid pump design shown in Fig. 1, the pump housing consists of two parts an upper portion 58 and a lower portion 60 welded together by a weld 61. Also unlike the conventional pump, the upper portion 58 see Fig. 4 has an inner surface 62 that contacts the diaphragm at its rest position 54 To describe the manner by which liquid is pumped using the invented design of Figures 4 and 5, let us begin with the diaphragm at its upward rest position 54 After the diaphragm has reached its fully extended position 54 For the prior art two valve pump the finite resistance to flow of the inlet valve 16 of Fig. 1 is important because all flow must be accomplished in approximately 1 ms, thus a higher reservoir pressure leads to a higher flow rate through the inlet valve and hence higher stroke volume. For the invented design of Figs. 4 and 5, at least 15 seconds can be allowed for the diaphragm to reach its normal rest position 54 In operation, the diaphragm will move precisely and repeatably from 54 Another advantage of the present invention is that the ceramic filter 80 can have a sufficiently small pore size, e.g., 1 20 microns, so that bubbles that get into the reservoir will be prevented from entering the pump chamber 56. Since any significant bubble in the pump chamber 56 will prevent the output valve 70 from opening, it is very important to prevent bubbles from getting into the pump chamber 56. Another advantage of the present invention is that the single valve output valve 70 can be placed on the side of the pump body 60, thereby reducing the height of the pump, therefore allowing a thinner overall height for an implantable infusion pump. Furthermore, the exit valve spring 78 can be made longer when the valve is on the side of the pump body 60, thereby making the adjustment of the exit valve 70 seating force less critical and, therefore, less difficult to manufacture.
