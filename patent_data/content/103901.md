## Description
This invention relates to a multilayer analytical element. More particularly, this invention relates to an improvement of a multilayer analytical element containing a color indicator system for detection of hydrogen peroxide which is appropriately employable in quantitative analysis of hydrogen peroxide in a liquid sample, or in quantitative analysis of a specific component through quantitative determination of the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced upon contact of the specific component with an oxidase enzyme system. A quantitative analysis of a specific component referred to herein as analyte based on quantitative determination of the amount of H₂O₂ produced by an oxidation reaction between the analyte or a reaction product of the analyte and oxidase, by means of an appropriate determination procedure has recently become more important. The reason is that the quantitative determination of H₂O₂ can be done accurately and reliably, for instance, by colorimetric determination of a colored product formed by the action of H₂O₂ in the presence of peroxidase. As for the colorimetric determination method based on the above mentioned principle, there is known a method using a reagent system proposed by P. Trinder Ann. Clin. Biochem., 6, 24 27 1969 . This method involves producing H₂O₂ by a reaction between an analyte and oxidase causing an oxidative coupling reaction between 4 aminoantipyrine or an analogue thereof and a phenol or a naphthol in the presence of produced H₂O₂ and peroxidase to produce a colored product and quantitatively determining the so produced colored product. This reaction system is advantageous because the same detection system is employable regardless of varying the kind of oxidase. Accordingly, this reaction system has been studied for application in detection of various analytes. Examples of oxidases particularly important in the art of clinical chemical tests include glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, uricase, glycerol oxidase, and phosphoglucose oxidase, etc. An analytical element employing said oxidase and a detection system for the produced H₂O₂ in the form of an integral multilayer analytical element, or a strip such as a filter paper strip impregnated with these reagents is widely employed for clinical tests. These analytical elements comprise a composition containing reagents directly participating in the detection of an analyte which is impregnated in a filter paper strip or the like, or coated over a filmy support. The integral multilayer analytical element can be in a variety of constitutions, and different functional layers can be incorporated into the element under lamination as need arises. Examples of known functional layers include a spreading layer for uniform spreading of a liquid sample US PS 3 992 158, GB 1 440 464, and US PS 4 292 272 a light shielding layer providing a light scattering white surface for reflective measurement, as well as serving for optically separating the colored product produced upon the reaction from colored components contained within the upper layer US PS 3 992 158, GB 1 440 464, and US PS 4 042 335, US PS 4 255 384, and US PS 4 292 274, etc. a barrier layer for selective diffusion of component, product, etc. US PS Re 30267 or a liquid blocking air barrier layer for the same purpose Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 58 1983 77660, and GB 2 114 737A a detection layer for efficient detection by mordanting the colored product US PS 4 042 335 and US PS 4 144 306 a migration inhibiting layer for preventing diffusion of the colored product into other layers US PS 4 166 093 and an adhesive layer for improvement of adhesion between the incorporated layers US PS 4 292 272, etc. . EP A 0 033 539 describes 1,2,3 trisubstituted compounds of 4 amino 3 pyrazolin 5 one for use in a wet analysis element. As a result of the study of the present inventor, it has been noted that a calibration curve prepared for quantitative analysis of glucose or cholesterol using a multilayer analytical element containing in its reagent layer a color forming reagent composition for detection of H₂O₂ including glucose oxidase or a combination of cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase, peroxidase, 4 aminoantipyrine, and 1,7 dihydroxynaphthalene shows a relatively gentle slope γ , and particularly gentle in a high concentration region where a liquid sample containing a great amount of glucose or cholesterol is calibrated. This means that such a analytical element gives poor accuracy in the quantitative analysis, as well as narrow measurable range. The present inventors have studied the above mentioned problem and discovered that employment of a 1,2,3 tri substituted compound of 4 amino 3 pyrazolin 5 one which is analogous to 4 aminoantipyrine i.e. 4 amino 2,3 dimethyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolin 5 one but has lower solubility in water than that of the 4 aminoantipyrine in the reagent layer of the multilayer analytical element in place of the 4 aminoantipyrine effectively eliminates the above mentioned problem. This 1,2,3 tri substituted compound having poor solubility has been not employed for the instant object in a wet process conducted in an aqueous solution for quantitative analysis of glucose or cholesterol, because in the wet process it gives color formation of poor optical density and accordingly is low in the sensitivity. Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved multilayer analytical element containing a color forming reagent composition for detection of H₂O₂ in a reagent layer, in which a calibration curve prepared in the analytical process using said element has a steep slope γ and said steep slope is maintained even in a high analyte concentration region, whereby the measurable range is broadened, the sensitivity is enhanced, and the quantitative accuracy is improved. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved multilayer analytical element containing a color forming reagent composition including a combination of a chromogen and a coupler, and peroxidase for detection of H₂O₂ in a reagent layer, in which a calibration curve prepared in the analytical process using said element has a steep slope γ and said steep slope is maintained even in a high analyte concentration region, whereby the measurable range is broadened, the sensitivity is enhanced, and the quantitative accuracy is improved. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved multilayer analytical element containing a color forming reagent composition including a combination of a chromogen and a coupler, oxidase and peroxidase for detection of H₂O₂ in a reagent layer, in which a calibration curve prepared in the analytical process using said element has a steep slope γ and said steep slope is maintained even in a high analyte concentration region, whereby the measurable range is broadened, the sensitivity is enhanced, and the quantitative accuracy is improved, and which enable to carry out the analytical process within a short period of time. The present invention provides The wet analysis performed in an aqueous solution containing analytical reagent according to prior art document EP A 0 033 539 is clearly distinguishable from the analysis performed in a multilayer element according to the present invention. The use of the compound of the formula 1 as chromogen in a multilayer analytical element gives an improved analytical element having the desired characteristics as compared to a known multilayer analytical element using the known 4 amino antipyrine as the chromogen. Such improvements are clearly shown in the following disclosure in the form of examples using the compounds according to the present invention and comparison examples using 4 amino antipyrine or 4 amino 1,1 dimethyl 3 phenyl 3 pyrazolin 5 one. The results clearly indicate that the multilayer analytical element according to the present invention is highly sensitive and is broadened in the measurable range and further improved in the measurement accuracy. Fig. 1 through Fig. 3 are calibration curves indicating relationships between glucose content concentration in liquid samples and optical density of formed color which were prepared in the use of multilayer analytical elements according to the present invention as well as multilayer analytical elements produced for comparison purpose. In these figures, a curve having circular marks and a curve having triangular marks represent calibration curves of the multilayer analytical element film of the invention and that of the comparison example. The quantitative analysis was carried out on human whole blood samples and human plasma samples containing different amounts of glucose. The measurement was made through reflective measurement procedure.

Among these peroxidases and other compounds having the peroxidase activity, peroxidases of plant origin and non specific peroxidases of microorganism origin are preferred. As described hereinbefore, the reagent layer comprised in the multilayer analytical element of the present invention is a reagent layer which comprises a combination of chromogen and coupler a color indicator composition and peroxidase dispersed or dissolved in a hydrophilic polymer binder. There is no specific limitation on a hydrophilic polymer employable as the polymer binder, so far as the polymer is capable of forming a film and is substantially inert to peroxidase and the combination of chromogen and coupler. Examples of the hydrophilic polymer include gelatin, acid processed gelatin, deionized gelatin, gelatin derivatives such as acylated gelatin, poly vinyl alcohol , poly vinylpyrrolidone , poly sodium vinylbenzenesulfonate , carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, pullulan, pullulan derivatives, polyacrylamide, and acrylamide copolymers such as acrylamide N vinylpyrrolidone copolymer and acrylamide 2 hydroxyethylacrylamide copolymer. The thickness dry basis of the reagent layer generally ranges from 5 µm to 100 µm, preferably from 10 µm to 50 µm. The peroxidase contained in the reagent layer generally amounts to from 5,000 U m² to 100,000 U m², preferably from 10,000 U m² to 60,000 U m², The combination of chromogen and coupler is necessarily incorporated in an amount equivalent to or more than the amount stoichiometrically corresponding to a presumed maximum amount of the analyte contained in the liquid sample under analysis. The amount of the combination of chromogen and coupler can be determined by those skilled in the art through experimental trials. If the analyte is not hydrogen peroxide, but is able to produce hydrogen peroxide by a chemical reaction, an oxidase serving as a catalyst for the reaction between the analyte and oxygen for producing hydrogen peroxide can be included in the reagent layer or another layer. The oxidase included in the multilayer analytical element is necessarily chosen according to nature of the analyte. The oxidase can be employed singly, but a plurality of enzymes containing at least one oxidase can be employed for causing a series of continuous reactions. If required, a cofactor or an activator to oxidase and or its coenzyme can be employed in conjunction with the oxidase. The oxidase, if required, together with its coenzyme, can be included in a reagent layer containing the combination of chromogen and coupler, and peroxidase, or in a layer provided over the reagent layer. Otherwise, it can be included in both the reagent layer containing either of the combination of chromogen and coupler, and peroxidase, and one or more layers provided over the reagent layer. Thus, it can be included in two or more layers. The above mentioned term a layer provided over the reagent layer means to include a porous spreading layer. A reaction of a substrate catalyzed by oxidase requires oxygen. In this respect, since oxygen in a circumferential air is to be introduced from a porous spreading layer to diffuse into other layers, a multi layer analytical element in which an oxidase is included in a layer provided over the reagent layer containing the combination of chromogen and coupler, and peroxidase particularly in a porous spreading layer or a layar adjacent to the spreading layer so as to accomplish efficient diffusion of oxygen into the layers, as disclosed in GB 2 104 215A, is preferably employed for facilitating efficient progress of the oxidation reaction catalyzed by oxidase. In the case that the analyte is a hydrophobic substance such as a cholesterol ester, the analyte difficultly permeates the layer having a hydrophilic polymer binder. For this reason, oxidase is preferably included inside of a porous spreading layer in such a case. The oxidase to be contained in a multilayer analytical element of the present invention may be an oxidase utilizing oxygen O₂ as acceptor. Examples of the oxidase utilizing oxygen O₂ as acceptor include the following enzymes the number included in parenthesis given to the listed enzyme meaning EC number glycollate oxidase 1.1.3.1 , malate oxidase 1.1.3.3 , glucose oxidase 1.1.3.4 , hexose oxidase 1.1.3.5 , cholesterol oxidase 1.1.3.6 , aryl alcohol oxidase 1.1.3.7 , L gulonolactone oxidase 1.1.3.8 , galactose oxidase 1.1.3.9 , alcohol oxidase 1.1.3.13 , L 2 hydroxyacid oxidase 1.1.3.15 , aldehyde oxidase 1.2.3.1 , xanthine oxidase 1.2.3.2 , pyruvate oxidase 1.2.3.3 , pyruvate oxidase CoA acetylating 1.2.3.6 , lathosterol oxidase 1.3.3.2 , D aspartate oxidase 1.4.3.1 , L aminoacid oxidase 1.4.3.2 , D aminoacid oxidase 1.4.3.3 , amine oxidase flavine containing 1.4.3.4 , pyridoxaminephosphate oxidase 1.4.3.5 , amine oxidase copper containing 1.4.3.6 , D glutamate oxidase 1.4.3.7 , sarcosine oxidase 1.5.3.1 , N methylaminoacid oxidase 1.5.3.2 , N⁶ methyl L lysine oxidase 1.5.3.4 , uricase ureate oxidase 1.7.3.3 , sulfite oxidase 1.8.3.1 , ascorbate oxidase 1.10.3.3 , 3 hydroxyanthranylate oxidase 1.10.3.5 , arginine 2 monooxygenase 1.13.12.1 , lysine 2 monooxigenase 1.13.12.2 , tryptophan 2 monooxygenase 1.13.12.3 , lactate oxidase lactate 2 monooxygenase 1.13.12.4 , dimethylaniline monooxygenase 1.14.13.8 , cholesterol 7α monooxygenase 1.14.13.17 , flavoprotein linked monooxygenase 1.14.14.1 , phenylalanine monooxygenase 1.14.16.1 , glycerol oxidase available from Toyo Jozo Co., Ltd., Japan , and glycine oxidase described in ENCYCLOPAEDIA CHIMICA, Vol. 3, published in September of 1960 by Kyoritsu Shppan Co., Ltd., Japan . Examples of a combination of a plurality of enzymes including oxidase include the following Among these oxidases, preferably employable in the multilayer analytical element of the present invention are glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, pyruvate oxidase, uricase, ascorbate oxidase, lactate oxidase, and glycerol oxidase. Also preferred are several combinations including the oxidase exemplified above. The amount of oxidase to be contained in the multilayer analytical element can be determined principally by a ratio between a presumed maximum amount of a hydrogen peroxide producible analyte contained in a liquid sample under analysis and activity values of oxidase and peroxidase. Thus, the amount of oxidase can be determined experimentally by those skilled in the art. The amount of oxidase generally ranges from 1,000 U m² to 100,000 U m², and preferably ranges from 3,000 U m² to 50,000 U m². In the case that oxidase is glucose oxidase, the amount generally ranges from 2,000 U m² to 40,000 U m², and preferably ranges from 4,000 U m² to 20,000 U m². Each of peroxidase and oxidase has an optimum pH range respectively where their activities are kept at the maximum value. Their activities are also influenced by an ionic strength and natures of anions and cations present in the vicinity of these enzymes. Accordingly, it is very important for obtaining results satisfactory in the quantitative accuracy, reproducibility, etc. that a multilayer analytical element is so prepared that primarily a pH value of a reagent layer containing peroxidase, a reagent layer containing oxidase, or a reagent layer containing both of peroxidase and oxidase is adjusted to a respective optimum value, and that, if necessary, other factors such as the ionic strength and nature of coexisting ions are adjusted to show optimum conditions. For these reasons, it is especially advantageous that a multilayer analytical element of the present invention contains an acid, an alkali, a salt, a buffer reagent, a dissociating agent, a surface active agent, etc. in one or more of the functional layers such as a porous spreading layer, a reagent layer, and a light shielding layer. The reagents and their amounts employed for the above mentioned adjustment of the conditions vary depending upon the analytical purpose and other factors and can be selected in view of the analytical purpose. In order to produce a detectable change in the presence of hydrogen peroxide by incorporating an acid, an alkali or a buffer reagent into the reagent layer containing the combination of chromogen and coupler, and peroxidase, the pH value is preferably adjusted to pH 7.0 of the optimum pH value for peroxidase or a value in the vicinity of pH 7.0, such as, in the range of pH 5.0 to pH 9.0, preferably pH 6.0 to pH 8.0. Different oxidases have their optimum pH values for instance, pH 5.6 approx. for glucose oxidase pH 6.3 approx. for hexose oxidase pH 5.8 approx. for cholesterol oxidase pH 7.0 approx. for galactose oxidase pH 7.5 approx. for alcohol oxidase pH 7.5 8.5 for uricase pH 5.6 approx. for ascorbate oxidase and pH 7.5 7.7 for L α glycerophosphate oxidase. The layer containing oxidase is preferably adjusted to have an optimum pH value or a pH value in the vicinity of the optimum value, according to the requirment of nature of oxidase contained therein. Accordingly, an oxidase having an optimum pH value different from an optimum pH value of a peroxidase employed together is preferably included in a layer different from a peroxidase containing layer. For instance, glucose oxidase can be included in a porous spreading layer or an adhesive layer described hereinafter . In this case, said layer containing glucose oxidase can be so prepared to show under analytical procedures pH 5.6 of the optimum pH value for glucose oxidase or a value in the vicinity of pH 5.6, such as, in the range of pH 3.6 to pH 7.6, preferably pH 4.0 to pH 7.0, by incorporating appropriately an acid or a buffer thereinto.

Goods, et al. Biochemistry, Into one or more layers selected from the group consisting of the reagent layer, other layers over the reagent layer, or the spreading layers, there can be incorporated a compound comprising a cation capable of forming in combination with F ion a sparingly water soluble salt having solubility of not more than 0.2 g. in 100 g. of water at 25 Into one or more layers selected from the group consisting of the reagent layer, other layers over the reagent layer, or the spreading layers, there can be incorporated a water soluble monocarboxylic acid or a salt thereof having solubility of not less than 1 g. in 100 g. of water at 25 The aliphatic monocarboxylic acid can be a straight or branched chain saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 1 5 carbon atoms, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, isobutyric acid or isovaleric acid. The salt of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid can be an alkali metal salt of the straight or branched chain saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 1 5 carbon atoms, such as a lithium salt, a sodium salt, or a potassium salt. Otherwise, an ammonium salt can be employed. Examples of the salt include a lithium salt, a sodium salt, a potassium salt and an ammonium salt of formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid.

The amount of the water soluble monocarboxylic acid or the salt thereof contained in the multilayer analytical element generally ranges from 0.1 meq. to 1 eq., preferably from 0.2 meq. to 0.5 eq. based on 1 m² of the element. The sparingly soluble F salt forming compound and the water soluble monocarboxylic acid or the salt thereof can be included in combination. Otherwise, compounds having both activities such as CH₃COO ₂Ca, CH₃COO ₂Mg, can be employed. The porous spreading layer referred to herein as spreading layer of the multilayer analytical element of the present invention is arranged in the outmost position of the element. In other words, the spreading layer is provided on the outmost position far from the support via the reagent layer. The liquid sample is applied or spotted onto the spreading layer. The function of this layer is to supply a liquid sample together with an analyte contained therein into the reagent layer at an approximately constant volume per unit area regardless of its applied volume, that is to say, metering effect . Thus, this layer acts as a spreader for a liquid sample. Because of such spreading action, a volume of the liquid sample supplied to the reagent layer per unit area is automatically adjusted to a certain value regardless of its applied volume. This means that a liquid sample can be analyzed quantitatively without precise measurement of the volume when applied to the multilayer analytical element. However, it should be understood that the use of the multilayer analytical elment of the invention never excludes doing precise measurement of a liquid sample in carrying out a quantitative analysis procedure. The precise measurement of a liquid sample is sometimes advantageous to increase accuracy of the analysis. Example of the porous spreading layer of the present invention include a non fibrous isotropically porous layer as disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication JPPP No. 49 1974 53888 Japanese Patent Publication Jap. Publn. No. 53 1978 21677 , US PS 3 992 158, and GB 1 440 464, for instance, a membrane filter, a blushed polymer layer, and an isotropically porous layer comprising voids defined by fine spheres or particles bound to each other through a polymer binder adhesive an isotropically porous layer having continuous voids and being formed by three dimensional matrix in which fine spherical beads are bound in point to point contact in all directions through binder not swelling with water, as disclosed in US PS 4 258 001 a fibrous anisotropically porous spreading layer consisting of water washed fabrics or hydrophilically processed fabrics, as disclosed in US PS 4 292 272 a fibrous anisotropocally porous spreading layer consisting of fabrics having phisically activated surfaces, as disclosed in GB 2 087 074A and a fibrous anisotropic porous spreading layer consisting of paper, paper filter or no woven fabrics containing synthetic polymer fiber pulps, as disclosed in GB 2 087 074A. Any of these spreading layers can be provided to the analytical element of the invention in manners disclosed in these patent specifications. Otherwise, a membrane filter or blushed polymer layer containing titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or barium sulfate in the form of fine powder disclosed in US PS 3 992 158 and GB 1 440 464 can be employed in the analytical element of the invention for serving as a spreading layer and also as a light shielding layer radiation blocking layer, white background layer, or light reflecting layer , details being given hereinafter. Further, a membrane filter or a blushed polymer layer containing carbon black can be employed as a spreading layer which also serves as a light shielding layer, as described hereinafter. If a liquid sample is a whole blood, the spreading layer preferably is the aforementioned isotropically porous layer having continuous voids and being formed by three dimensional matrix, or the fibrous anisotropically porous spreading layer. The multilayer analytical element of the invention can be provided with a light shielding layer radiation blocking layer, background layer, or light reflecting layer capable of allowing permeation of water and analyte, between the reagent layer and the spreading layer. The light shielding layer is advantageously provided if the analytical element is employed for analysis of a liquid sample containing colored particles such as the whole blood containing red corpuscles. In more detail, colored particles positioned on one side of the light shielding layer are optically shielded by the light shielding layer from observation through the transparent support.
