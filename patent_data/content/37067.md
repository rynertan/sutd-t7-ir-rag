# Alkyl modified siloxane copolymers useful as foam stabilizers in high resilience polyurethane foam.

## Abstract
Organosiloxane copolymers containing alkyl groups having from 5 to 20 carbon atoms that have beneficial utility as foam stabilizers in the manufacture of low density high resilience polyurethane foam solutions of such copolymers a process for producing low density high resilience polyurethane foam utilizing as a foam stabilizer said organo siloxane copolymers and the foams derived therefrom.
