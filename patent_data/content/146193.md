## Description
installation FOR FIE PROTECrION BACKGROUND OF THE InventionThe invention relates to an installation for fire protection consisting of a conduit or cable which is passed through a wall, whilst fireresistant means with inturrescent effects have been applied in the vicinity of the passage. Known installations of this type have been provided with fire resistant weans with an intumescent effect in the form of a paint which has been applied by brush or spray gun.This state of the art calls for improvement, firstly because in the vicinity of the passage the amount which can be deposited is relatively small for a useful inturtescent effect and secondly the mcde of application is tire consuming and difficult, especially when a great punter of lines are present which are passed through in a closely packed bundle.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVE ION The invention provides an improvement in that the fire resistant means according to the invention consist of a length of tubing provided with a longitudinal cut and fitting tightly round the conduit. Upon application of this improvement, firstly a considerable quantity of fire resistant material is present in the vicinity of the passage, so that in the event of a fire so much foam accumulates on the wall that a seal is created also for any smoke generated, and secondly the fire resistant material is quite simple to apply and therefore more reliable in use because the length of tubing, upon being bent open, can readily be fitted round the conduit or cable whereupon it snaps shut.In addition, the improvement turns out to be such that, as official fire tests have shown, the lead through equipment itself need not invariably consist of fire resistant material.The invention also comprises a separate length of tubing that is obviously intended for use in a lead through installation which has to be made fire resistant. For a more reliable ensvrapment, the length of tubing according to the invention may be provided with a longitudinal cut following a helical course.For cases where an enhanced insulating and intumescent effect is required during a fire, it is possible to select a length of tubing according to the inventon which has an enlarged rim at one end.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF Thz DRS NG To elucidate the invention, a number of examples will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a vertical cross sectional view perpendicular to a steel wall at a point where a number of lines are passed through this wall, which lines are provided with lengths of tubing according to the invention Figure 2 is a sectional view on the line Il Il in figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective representation on an enlarged scale of a length of tubing according to the invention and Figure 4 represents a variant design of a length of tubing. DETEI DESCRIETION Figures 1 and 2, illustrating a preferred example of the invention, depict a steel wall 1, for instance a bulkhead in a ship, which has to be fire resistant. To this end, the wall 1 has been clad with rock wool 2 for heat insulation, but at those spots where lines 3 are passed through the wall 1 other measures have to be taken to prevent transmission of heat. The passage is formed, in otherwise known fashion, by a steel frame 4 which has been welded to the wall 1 and filled up with rubber blocks 6,each of which has a semi cylindrical cavity such that disposed in pairs with the said cavities facing each other, they form a passage 7 through which lines 3 run.A strip 8 which is vertically displaceable within the framEwork 4 is pressed by means of bolts 5 on the assembly of rubber blocks 6, so that all rubber blocks are subjected to compressive stress and a seal is achieved between the rubber blocks 6 and the framework 4 as well as between the rubber blocks 6 and the lines 3 running through the passage 7. To enhance the fire resistance of the zone of passage described hereinbefore, intumescent fire resisting material has been inserted according to the invention in the form of lengths of tubing 9 which are provided with a longitudinal cut 10 Figure 3 and which fit tightly round the lines 3 and are squeezed against the rubber blocks 6.Figure 3 depicts a length of tubing 9 which can be bent open along its longitudinal cut, fitted tightly round a cable 3 and then pushed up against the rubber blocks 6. This is also readily achieved when a great number of cables are present in a relatively thick bundle, as represented in Figures 1 and 2. Thus a large amount of fire resistant material is deposited near the passage, so that in the event of a fire a thick layer of heatinsulating and slit sealing matter accumulates against the rubber blocks 6. Tests have shown that this effect produced by the invention is sufficiently strong, also when material that is not fireresistant is used for the rubber blocks 6, to conform to a certain official body of fire resistance requirements. Figure 4 represents a variant design of a length of tubing 11, characterized in that the length of tubing is provided at one end with an enlarged rim 12. The longitudinal cut 13 has an alternative shape in the sense that this cut follows a helical course.The invention is not restricted to the eneodnents of the length of tubing depicted in Figures 3 and 4, but encompasses other follns as well, such as square or hexagonal lengths of tubing.Furthermore, the scope of the invention is not confined to a leadthrough system with rubber blocks, but the invention is applicable with equal efficacy to various other types of lead through equipment.
