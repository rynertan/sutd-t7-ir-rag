# Ring of light laser optics system.

## Abstract
This invention provides a simplified laser optics system for generating a ring shaped beam of laser radiation which is used for contouring and severing a curved, particulary a dome shaped, article such as a silicone elastomer contact lens 122 from a workpiece 118 . The laser optics system consists essentially of a focusing element 100 having a convex surface 104 which receives a circular beam 114 of laser radiation and an opposed conical surface 106 forming an axicon which element transforms the circular beam into a ringshaped beam of laser radiation. The ring shaped beam is received by a reflective element having a reflective surface 110 which causes the beam to impinge upon the curved workpiece surface, preferably at an angle which is substantially perpendicular to the work piece surface, to accomplish edge contouring and severing of the article from the workpiece.
