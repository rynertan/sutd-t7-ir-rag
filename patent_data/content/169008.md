# FCC catalyst stripping method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for improving the stripping of hydrocarbons from catalyst particles in a fluidized catalytic cracking FCC unit. A stripper vessel is located directly adja cent the exhaust barrel of a separator and immediately begins stripping hydrocarbon from catalyst particles. The stripper is sealed at the catalyst exit by a catalyst seal pot, with the drain sized to permit only a portion of catalyst flow to pass there through, with the remainder catalyst overflowing the seal pot. A short contact time stripper and catalyst particle deflector reduce the residence time of hydrocarbons with catalyst par ticles.
