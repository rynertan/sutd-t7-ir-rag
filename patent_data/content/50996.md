# Uncured filled coating compositions and cured products thereof.

## Abstract
An uncured but curable filled coating composition comprises a a polyfunctional acrylic type carboxylic acid ester monomer or its prepolymer, b a polymerization initiator capable of curing said monomer or prepolymer a , and c an inorganic solid filler, the composition consisting essentially of A 100 parts by weight of a polyfunctional acrylic type carboxylic acid ester monomer or prepolymer a composed of 0 to 75 by weight of a trifunctional or higher acrylic type carboxylic acid ester monomer having a molecular weight of 200 to 700 or prepolymer thereof and 25 to 100 by weight of a difunctional acrylic type carboxylic acid ester monomer having a molecular weight of about 160 to about 400 or prepolymer thereof, B 0.001 to 20 parts by weight of a polymerization initiator b , and C 5 to 250 parts by weight of an inorganic solid filler c having a refractive index of 1.40 to 1.60 and an average first order particle diameter of at least 1 mµ but less than 1 µ.
