# Pd Pt catalyst composition for hydrocarbon reforming and reforming process using same.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition suitable for use in the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons comprises palladium and platinum composited with an inorganic oxide support and wherein the total concentration of Pd Pt is in the range of from 0.2 to 0.6 wt. , and the molar ratio of Pd to Pt is in the range of from 1 1 to 10 1. The composition preferably contains rhenium, and preferably contains a small proportion of copper to reduce hydrogenolysis. When the composition is employed as catalyst in a reforming process, the hydrocarbon are converted to desirable conversion products in good yields which are maintained over relatively long periods.
