# PUMP OR MOTOR WITH A FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGM

## Abstract
A material handing device such as a pump or motor including a substantially longitudinally inextensible diaphragm clamped around its periphery between upper and lower housing parts, the lower housing part having an internal surface forming, together with the diaphragm the chamber of the device. A deflector assembly including at least three rollers is mounted in bearings which in turn are mounted, preferably pivotally, on the lower housing part so as to be readily releasable to enable the diaphragm to be changed. The upper housing part may be provided with a casing which can be pressurized to a pressure intermediate the inlet and outlet pressures of the device.
