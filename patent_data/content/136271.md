# Apparatus for detecting tapping of light energy from an optical fiber.

## Abstract
In a data transmission system where a computer side and a terminal side are connected with the aid of an optical fiber cable FK , unauthorized tapping of light energy from some fiber in the cable can be detected. The transmitted signals are assumed to be shot noise limited, i.e. the trans mitted light is heavily superposed, whereby a large part of the transmitted light must be tapped off for listening. The computer side and terminal side contain level sensing cir cuits NVK1, NVK2 connected to respective receiver units MD, MT which send an alarm when tapping takes place. An optical fiber relay RK is connected between the fiber cable FK and the terminal side for short circuiting this side in the case where a power failure can occur.
