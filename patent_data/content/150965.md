DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention will be described in more detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.For a better understanding of the invention, there is first illustrated the apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 2 which illustrate the first embodiment of the present invention, numeral 1 represents a disc type conveying means, on the outer periphery of which chemical analytical instrument seats 3 1 to 3 9 for placing the required number nine of chemical analytical instruments chemical analytical slides 2 are provided substantially at equal spaces. Each of said seats is formed by a hole or a depressed concave whose outer side part is opened, and each of the insertion holes 3 1 to 3 9 is opened in the radial direction toward outer edge of the conveying means 1. The chemical analytical slide 2 is formed, for example, by housing a sheet type multilayer chemical analytical element in a plastic slide frame 2b and providing a hole 2c for spotting a liquid sample at the central part of the upper side of the frame 2b and a hole not shown for photometry at the central part of the lower side thereof, said multilayer chemical analytical instrument being integrally assembled by laminating a reagent layer not shown onto a water impermeable transparent support not shown and then a porous spreading layer 2a thereon in order. The slide frame may be provided with a notch 2d to facilitate its handling. A small hole 4 for detecting a position is provided at the inner part of each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 of the conveying means, and at least one standard reflecting plate 5 is laid adjoining any one of the seats 3 1 to 39. Temperature control boards 6,7 are provided so as to horizontally hold the conveying means 1 therebetween.These temperature control boards 6, 7 are fixed by a frame not shown , etc. and rotatably support the conveying means 1. A projecting edge 8 is provided upwardly on the edge of the outer periphery of the lower temperature control board 7 in the unitary structure with the board.The conveying means 1 is fitted into the inside of the projecting edge 8, whereby the outer opening part of each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 is blockaded. The upper temperature control board 6 this may be a covering means has a fan shaped notch 9 so that upper area corresponding to four seats among the seats 3 1 to 3 9 is opened in order to carry out the supply of the chemical analytical slide 2, the spotting of the liquid sample on the chemical analytical slide 2, the measurement of the chemical analytical slide 2 and the discharge of the chemical analytical slide 2 after measurement. The supply of the chemical analytical slide 2 is conducted at the position A, while the spotting of the liquid sample onto the chemical analytical slide 2 is conducted at the position B adjacent to the position A and downstream therefrom in the direction of the rotation of the conveying means 1. The discharge of the chemical analytical slide 2 is conducted at the position C adjacent to the position A and upstream therefrom in the direction of the rotation of the conveying means 1, and the measurement of the chemical analytical slide 2 is performed at the position D adjacent to the position C and upstream therefrom. A pulse motor 10 or a continuous motor is provided in the frame and connected through a power transmission means 11 to the conveying means 1.The means 1 is continuously or intermittently revolved by means of the pulse motor 10, and in the latter case each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 can be stopped at the supply position A, the spotting position B, the measuring position D and the discharge position C. The upper and lower temperature control board 6, 7 are provided internally with a heater or cooling instrument utilizing Peltier effect and heat is supplied to each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 whereby the chemical analytical slide 2 on which the liquid sample has been spotted can be kept at a constant temperature for incubation . At the position A, a fresh chemical analytical slide 2 is supplied to each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 continuously or intermittently moved in order by the hand or a chemical analytical slide supply means not shown . At the position B, there is provided a liquid sample spotting device or mean. In the spotting device, for example, a manually operatable micropipette 12 is detachably supported by a frame and the liquid sample in the pipette 12 is spotted on the spreading layer 2a of each of the chemical analytical slides 2 continuously or intermittently passed therethrough in order. At the measuring position D, there is provided an opening not shown for photometric measurement on the lower temperature control board 7. The size of this opening is such that the chemical analytical slides 2 placed on the seats 3 1 to 3 9 of the conveying means 1 do not drop and the chemical analytical slide 2 can be applied therethrough with a light to measure optical reflection density. The chemical analytical slide 2 can receive light for the reflection density measurement through the opening via a photometric head 14 from a light source 13.The reflected light from the chemical analytical slide 2 is passed through the photometric head 14 and the filter 17 of a filter disc 16 rotated by means of a DC motor 15 or a pulse motor and supplied to a photoelectric conversion amplifier such as photomultiplier 18 where relative comparison is made by using a signal of reflected light from the standard reflecting plate 5 as a reference signal and optical reflection density is calculated. The content of analyte in the liquid sample is colorimetrically determined on the basis of the resulting value and then display or printing is made. Similarly, the characteristics of the analyte can be judged. The filter 16 is composed of a plurality of the filters 17 replaceable to meet the analyte. The filter 16 has small holes 19, each thereof being provided at a position corresponding to each filter 17.By applying light and receiving the reflected light through the small hole 19, the position of the filter 17 can be detected by photosensors 20, 21. At the position D, a guide roller 22 for pressing the slide is provided on the conveying means 1. The outer periphery of the guide roller 22 is covered with a black material having low reflection ratio, preferably a cloth, a black matte filling, a black matte coating having an optical density of 2.5 or above, or with a white coating. When the chemical analytical slide 2 is positioned above the opening of the temperature control board 7, the guide roller 22 is operated so as to bring the chemical analytical slide 2 into contact closely with the opening, while when the slide 2 is not positioned above the opening, the guide roller blockades the opening. Therefore, when the chemical analytical slide 2 is not positioned above the opening, the optical reflection density of the guide roller 22 is measured so that the presence or the absence of the chemical analytical slide 2 can be judged from the measured optical reflection density of the guide roller 22. At the discharge position C, the projecting edge 8 has a notch 23 and an on off door 24 for opening and closing the notch 23 is provided and supported by an elevating device 25, the lower side of which is supported by a frame, etc. When the elevating device 25 is lifted, the notch 23 is blockaded by the door 24, while when the elevating device 25 descends, the notch, i.e. any one of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 is opened outward. A passage 26 for discharging the slide in the direction of the diameter of the conveying means 1 is provided outside the on off door 24, and communicates with any one of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 when the on off door 24 descends. At the discharge position C, there is provided a discharge device having a discharge lever 27 which is provided movably in the direction of the diameter of the conveying means 1. As mentioned above, the on off door 24 is allowed to communicate with the passage 26. When the discharge lever 27 is then moved outward, the projecting point of the lever is interlocked with one end of the notch 2d or an edge of the chemical analytical slide 2, whereby the slide 2 can be discharged to the passage 26. The numerals 28 and 29 represent photosensors for detecting positions by applying light and receiving the reflected light through the small holes 4 of the conveying means 1. The analytical method of the present invention will be described using the above described first embodiment for the measurement of GPT activity in a liquid sample 0 serum by keeping at 37 C the temperature of the enzyme GPT ALT analytical slide shown in Example 1 of JapanesePatent Provisional Publication No. 57 1982 208998. The experiment is done under such conditiones that the number n of times of measurements by reaction rate method is five times, interval t between measurements is 30 seconds and the number k of the seats for GPT analytical slide 2 is nine so that each of the seats 3 1 to 3 9 is rotated in a 40 degree arc every 10 3 seconds in the direction of an arrow shown in Figure 2.As seen from Figures 2 and 3, the GPT analytical slide 2 1 is supplied to the insertion hole 3 1 of the conveying means 1 at the chemical analytical supply position A. The conveying means 1 is then rotated in a 40 degree arc, and after 10 3 seconds, the first GPT analytical slide 2 1 reaches the liquid sample spotting position B where serum is spotted on the spreading layer of the first GPT analytical slide 2 1 by means of the micropipette 12. After the spotting is completed and the conveying means 1 is rotated in a 160 degree arc, i.e., after 40 3 seconds, the second GPT analytical slide 2 2 is supplied to the seat 3 2.After 10 3 seconds after the conveying means 1 is rotated in a 40 degree arc , the second GPT analytical slide 2 2 reaches the spotting position B where serum is spotted on the spreading layer of the second GPT analytical slide 2 2 by means of the micropipette 12, Further, after 10 3 seconds after the conveying means 1 is rotated in a 40 degree arc , i.e., after 60 3 seconds have passed since serum was spotted on the first GPT analytical slide 2 1, the slide 2 1 reaches the measuring position D where the first photometric measurement is made. After the conveying means 1 is further rotated in a 120 degree arc, i.e., after the lapse of 30 3 seconds, the seat 3 3 reaches the supply position A where the third GPT analytical slide 2 3 is supplied to the seat 3 3.In this way, the first to the ninth GPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 are supplied to the seats 3 1 to 3 9 which are conveyed to the supply position A in sequence every 50 3 seconds by rotation of the conveying means 1. After completion of the supply, serum is spotted on the GPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 which are conveyed to the spotting position B in sequence every 10 3 seconds by rotation of the conveying means 1. After the spotting was complete, the photometric measurement of each of theGPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 is conducted at the measuring position D every 60 3 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. When the chemical analytical slide is not yet placed on the depressed concave part which reached the measuring position D, the photometry of the guide roller is conducted at the position D, but the measured value is finally excluded.After the first measurement operation, the measurements of the second to the fifth times of each of the GPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 are conducted at the measuring position D in sequence every 90 3 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. Namely, as shown in Figure 4, the OD value of each of the GPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 is read five times and the activity of the objective enzyme is determined from the rate of change. The GPT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 9 whose fifth measurement has been completed, reach the chemical analytical slide removing position C after 10 3 seconds, i.e., after the means 1 is rotated in a 40 degree arc from the measuring position D. In the position C, the elevating device 25 is operated so that the on off door 24 is made to descend and the discharging passage 26 is made to communicate with the seats 3 1 to 3 9 in sequence. The discharge lever 27 is then moved outward and the GPT analytical slides 3 1 to 3 9 are discharged to the passage 26 in order. Thus, nine samples are colorimetrically determined within 150 seconds. The measurement of the GPT analytical slide 2 can be continuously made by repeatedly carrying out the abovedescribed operations. Figure 5 shows the second embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention wherein ten seats consisting of the parts 3 1 to 3 10 are provided at equal spaces on the outer periphery of the conveying means 1 so that the measurements of ten chemical analytical slides 2 can be always made the supply position A, the spotting positionB, the discharge position C and the measuring position D are positioned every other seat and other construction is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment.

The experiment is performed under such conditions that the number n of times of measurements by the reaction rate method is nine times, interval t between measurements is 15 seconds and each of the seats 3 1 to 3 10 for the GOT analytical slide 2 is rotated in a 36 degree arc every 1.5 seconds in the direction of an arrow shown in Figure 5.As seen from Figures 5 and 6, the first to tenth GOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 are supplied to the seats 3 1 to 3 10 which are conveyed to the supply position A in sequence every 13.5 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the supply is complete, serum is spotted on the GOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 by means of the micropipette 12, said slides being conveyed to the spotting position B in sequence every three sec.by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the spotting is complete, each photometric measurement of theGOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 is conducted at the measuring position D in order every six seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the measurement was complete, the measurements of the second to the ninth times of each of the GOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 are conducted at the measuring position D in order every 15 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. As shown in Figure 7, the OD value of each of theGOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 is read nine times, and the activity of the objective enzyme is colorimetrically determined from the rate of change. The GOT analytical slides 2 1 to 2 10 whose ninth measurement has been completed, reach the discharge position C every three sec.by the rotation of the conveying means 1, and are discharged to the discharge passage 26 in order as described above. Thus, 10 samples are analyzed within 135 seconds. Figure 8 shows the third embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention wherein 25 seats consisting of the parts 3 1 to 3 25 are provided at equal spaces on the outer periphery of the conveying means 1 so that the measurement of 25 chemical analytical slides 2 can be always made the spotting position B is positioned three seats beyond the supply position A, the discharge position C is positioned four seats beyond the supply position A and the measuring position D is positioned three seats beyond discharge position C and other construction is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment.

After supply, serum is spotted deposited on the amylase analytical slides 2 1 to 2 25 by means of the micropipette 12, said slides being conveyed to the spotting position B in order every 14.4 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1.After spotting, the each photometric measurement of the amylase analytical slides 2 1 to 2 25 is conducted at the measuring position D every 72 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the first measurement is complete, the second and the third photometric measurements of each of the amylase analytical slides 2 1 to 225 are conducted at the measuring position D in order every 120 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. As shown in Figure 10, the OD value of each of the amylase analytical slides 2 1 to 2 25 is read three times, and the activity of the objective enzyme is colorimetrically determined. After the third measurement is completed, the amylase analytical slides 2 1 to 2 25 reach the discharge position C in order every 14.4 sec.by the rotation of the conveying means 1, and are discharged to the passage 26.

In this case, experiment is performed under such conditiones that the number n of times of measurements is twice by the reaction rate method, interval t between measurements is 9 minutes and the number k of the seats 3 1 to 3 75 for the urea nitrogen analytical slide 2 is 75 so that each of the seats 3 1 to 3 75 of the conveying means 1 is rotated in a 4.8 degree arc every 7.2 seconds in the direction of an arrow shown in Figure 13.The first to the 75th urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 are supplied to the seats 3 1 to 3 75 which are conveyed to the supply position A in order every 14.4 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the supply is complete, serum is spotted deposited on the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 by means of the micropipette 12, said slides being conveyed to the spotting position B in order every 14.4 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1. After the spotting is complete, the each photometric measurement of the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 is made at the measuring position D in order every 72 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1.After the first measurement is completed, the second photometric measurement of each of the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 is conducted at the measuring position D in order every 9 minutes by the rotation of the conveying means 1. As shown in Figure 14, an increase intrinsic ammonia in OD value caused by ammonia in each of the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 is read and ammonia content is colorimetrically determined from each OD value. An increase ammonia from serum urea in addition to intrinsic ammonia in OD value caused by urea nitrogen in each of the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 275 is read in the second photometric measurement calculating urea nitrogen content from the difference between the above OD values. In this way, the analysis is carried out. After the second measurement is completed, the urea nitrogen analytical slides 2 1 to 2 75 reach the discharge position C in order every 10 seconds by the rotation of the conveying means 1 and are discharged to the passage 26 in order. Thus, 75 samples are analyzed within 18 min. According to conventional analytical method, there can be measured only the sum of intrinsic ammonia and ammonia from serum urea, while the apparatus of the present invention enables separately measuring both ammonia contents. When the above described first, second and third embodiments of the present invention are used for carrying out analysis by the reaction rate method, the factors n, t and k wherein n is an integer of 2 or greater and represents the number of times of measurements of each chemical analytical slide 2, t is the measuring interval of each chemical analytical slide 2, and k is an integer of 2 or greater and represents the number of the seats for the chemical analytical slide 2 of the conveying means 1 must satisfy such conditions that n and k are prime to each other and preferably the revolving speed of the conveying means 1 is either a round t or such that the rotation of 1 k rounds is made at time intervals of t k.The supply of the chemical analytical slides 2 to the seats 3 of the conveying means 1 is carried out at only one position fixed position , i.e., only the supply position A, and the slides are supplied to the n th seat 3 in order passed through the position A. Only one measuring position is provided at the position D, and there is measured every chemical analytical slide 2 passed therethrough. After the measurement is completed, every n th chemical analytical slide 2 is discharged in order from one discharge position C. Accordingly, k samples can be continuously analyzed for a period of nt.In the present invention, the measurement is made at time intervals of t k and the supply, the discharge and the spotting of the chemical analytical slide 2 are carried out at time intervals of nt k. Thus, any stage is preferably operated at regular intervals so that there is no fear of means such as the driving system of the apparatus, measured data processing mean, etc. being complicated. When the fourth embodiment of the present invention is used for carrying out analysis by the end point method, the measuring position D is provided at a position which is situated downstream from the supply position A in the direction of the rotation of the conveying means 1 and between the supply position A and the spotting position B, but relatively near the supply positionA, and the preliminary measurement and the final measurement can be conducted at the measuring position D in a similar manner to that in the reaction rate method.Therefore, the apparatus of the present invention is effectively applicable to analysis using a reagent which is unstable against oxidation by air so that background absorption fog must be deducted. When the fifth embodiment using double measurement is used for carrying out analysis by the reaction rate method, the measuring position D is provided at a position which is situated near to the spotting position B, but downstream from the position B in the direction of the rotation of the conveying means 1, and at this measuring position D the first measurement preliminary measurement is conducted in a short time after spotting a sample and the second measurement final measurement can be conducted after the lapse of a time t.Accordingly, intrinsic interfering substances are measured in the preliminary measurement, the final measurement gives the sum of the intrinsic interfering substances and a substance to be measured, and as a result, the value of the substance can be determined from the difference between both measured values so that a sample containing intrinsic interfering substances can be effectively analyzed. While various embodiments for the dry chemistry slide using the sheet type chemical analytical slide comprising the multilayer chemical instrument have been described in some detail, it will be understood that the present invention can be applied to dry analysis using a flat form container type chemical analytical instrument and multiple measurement of liquid analytical method using cuvette, test tube or the like. As the method of measurement, there can be used not only colorimetry, but also fluorometry, emission spectroanalysis, turbidimetry, potentiometry pH, Pro2, pH202, pNH3, etc. and the like.The chemical analytical route is not limited to the circle as described in the above embodiments, but other forms, for example, a quadrangle chemical analytical route using a frame driving means disclosed in JapanesePatent Provisional Publication No. 58 1983 21566 and an elliptic analytical chemical route using a chain driving means disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 58 1983 21567 may be used. These can be applied to analysis using the reaction rate method, when k represents the number of carriers, n is the number of times of measurements, a running speed is a round t and the chemical analytical slide is supplied to every n th carrier. Though the conveying means 1 forming a circular chemical analytical route in the above described embodiments is in a disc form, the means may be in other forms such as ring, conical or hemispherical form. The conveying means is continuously or intermittently rotated. At the supply position A, there may be provided an on off door and a supply passage as in the discharge position C, and the chemical analytical slide 2 may be supplied through the supply passage to the seat 3 of the conveying means 1 by means of a supply lever.Although the upper and the lower temperature control boards 6 and 7 are used as the constant temperature mean, the upper temperature control board 6 may be omitted.Further, it will be understood that modifications can be made in the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the present invention. As described above, the required number of the che micas analytical instruments can be automatically measured at regular time intervals in the present invention so that determination can be efficiently made with high accuracy. The supply of the chemical analytical instruments is carried out in order at a certain fixed position and at time intervals corresponding to the number of the required times of the measurements of the instruments. After the supply is complete, the measurement of the substance to be measured is made at a predetermined position in order of the chemical analytical instruments passed therethrough. The instruments are measured the number of the required times of measurements. After measurement, the chemical analytical instruments are discharged in order. In this way, the measurement of the chemical analytical instrument is made several times at a given position so that the present invention has advantages in that the measurement can be made in a simple manner, the apparatus can be miniaturized as a whole and the cost can be reduced.
