## Description
This invention relates to an area cutting method in a numerically controlled machine tool and, more particularly, to an area cutting method for cutting an area delimited by a curve of an external shape and at least two closed curves which lie within the curve of the external shape. Forms of numerically controlled machining include cutting in which the interior of an area bounded by the curve of an external shape comprising straight lines and circular arcs is hollowed out down to a predetermined depth, and die milling in which the interior of an area is die milled. In such machining, as shown in Fig. 1 A , an area cutting method is conventionally carried out by performing cutting along an i 1 th cutting path PTi 1 in one direction the direction of the solid line arrow , raising the tool a predetermined amount at the completion of cutting, then positioning the tool directly above a cutting starting point Ps on the next, or i th, cutting path PTi by moving the tool in the direction of the dashed line arrow, thereafter lowering the tool to the cutting starting point Ps, moving the tool along the i th cutting path PTi in the direction of the solid line arrow, and subsequently repeating the above unidirectional cutting. Another area cutting method shown in Fig. 1 B includes, following completion of cutting along the cutting path PTi 1 of the i 1 th cutting path, moving the tool from a cutting end point Pe to the cutting starting point Ps on the next, or i th, cutting path, and thereafter performing cutting along the i th cutting path PTi. Thus, cutting is performed back and forth in the direction of the solid line arrows. There are cases where it is required to cut an area AR shaded portion delimited by a curve OLC of an external shape and a closed curve INC inside the curve of the external shape, as shown in Fig. 2. The reason is that it is necessary to form bolt holes, which are needed for effecting a connection to another part, in the area hereafter referred to as an island IRD bounded by the closed curve INC, or to hollow out the island IRD to a depth less than that of the area AR by using a different tool. Thus, if the island IRD is present inside the curve of the external shape, the area AR the shaded portion in Fig. 2 delimited by the shape OLC of the external curve and the closed curve INC is cut, in accordance with the conventional method shown in Fig. 1 A or B , by a obtaining intersection points P Area cutting can thus be carried out with the conventional methods even if the island IRD is present. However, the conventional methods cannot be applied as they are if two or more islands are present and the spacing between the islands is small. By way of example, the conventional methods cannot be applied if, as shown in Fig. 4, two islands IRD₁, IRD₂ reside so close together inside the curve OLC of the external shape that offset curves INF₁, INF₂ intersect, the latter curves being obtained by offsetting closed curves INC₁, INC₂, which specify the respective islands, by a predetermined amount D e.g., a value obtained by adding tool radius r Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an area cutting method wherein, even if two or more islands reside so close together inside the curve OLC of the external shape that the offset curves INF₁, INF₂ of the respective closed curves INC₁, INC₂ specifying the islands intersect each other to give rise to a portion which is impossible to area cut, a remaining area cuttable portion, from which the above mentioned portion is omitted, is capable of being area cut. The present invention, which is defined in claim 1, provides a numerically controlled area cutting method for cutting an area delimited by a curve of an external shape and a plurality of closed curves by what is preferably, but not necessarily essentially, a unidirectional cutting method or a back and forth cutting method. The area cutting method has a step of calculating first and second offset curves obtained by outwardly offsetting each of the closed curves assumed to be two in number by an amount dependent upon tool diameter, a step of calculating points of intersection between each of the offset curves and an i th cutting path, a step of moving a tool, while the tool performs cutting, along the cutting path from a machining starting point on the i th cutting path to a first point of intersection of two points of intersection between the cutting path and the first offset curve, a step, executed in a case where a second point of intersection between the first offset curve and the cutting path lies inside the second offset curve, of moving the tool, without the tool performing cutting, from the first point of intersection to that point of intersection of two points of intersection between the second offset curve and the cutting path which does not lie inside the first offset curve, and a step of thereafter moving the tool, while the tool performs cutting, along the cutting path up to a machining end point, whereby an area delimited by the first and second offset curves is not cut. In a case where the second point of intersection of the two points of intersection between the first offset curve and the cutting path does not lie inside the second offset curve, the tool is moved, without performing cutting, from the first point of intersection to the second point of intersection, the tool is then moved while performing cutting along the cutting path from the second point of intersection to one of the points of intersection between the cutting path and the second offset curve, the tool is then moved, without performing cutting, from said point of intersection to the other point of intersection between the cutting path and the second offset curve, and the tool is subsequently moved while performing machining along the cutting path up to the machining end point.

Fig. 5 is a view for describing a method according to the present invention in general terms. The method provides an area cutting method for cutting an area AR delimited by a curve OFC of an external shape and at least two closed curves INC₁, INC₂ which lie within the curve of the external shape by moving a tool TL relative to a workpiece along a cutting path PT Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an apparatus for practicing a method of the present invention, and Fig. 7 is a flowchart of processing according to the present invention. An area cutting method in accordance with the present invention will now be described in accordance with Figs. 5, 6 and 7. In the case described above, an area cutting command is inserted into an NC tape in advance, cutting paths are generated successively by using the area cutting data that follow the area cutting command, and area cutting is performed by moving a tool along the cutting paths. However, the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. As an example, an arrangement can be adopted in which area cutting data are entered, NC data for area cutting are created through a technique similar to that described above using the area cutting data, and area cutting is performed upon feeding the NC data into an NC unit. Fig. 9 is a flowchart of processing for creating NC data for such area cutting. The only difference between this flowchart and that of Fig. 7 is that instead of moving the tool in the cutting feed mode or positioning the tool in the rapid traverse mode, NC data for cutting or for positioning are created. Further, the present invention has been described for a case where the invention is applied to area cutting performed by repeating unidirectional or back and forth cutting. However, the invention is not limited to such an arrangement but can be applied to a case where area cutting is performed by obtaining an offset curve offset by a predetermined amount from the curve of an external shape, cutting along the offset curve, thereafter obtaining another offset curve offset by a predetermined amount from the abovementioned offset curve, cutting along this other offset curve and subsequently repeating the foregoing operations. According to the present invention as described above, even if two or more islands reside so close together inside the curve OLC of the external shape that the offset curves INF₁, INF₂ of the respective closed curves INC₁, INC₂ specifying the islands intersect each other to give rise to a portion which is impossible to area cut, a remaining area cuttable portion, from which the above mentioned portion is omitted, is capable of being area cut. Accordingly, the invention is well suited for application to numerically controlled machining.
