## Description
The complexity of the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of and by hematopoietic cells is becoming increasingly apparent as the list of factors which are isolated controlling these events continuously increases. For the most part, these factors are present in extraordinarily minute amounts in conjunction with numerous other proteins which serve a wide variety of functions. Factors which have been isolated and demonstrated to have activity include such polypeptides and proteins as γ interferon, platelet derived growth factor, colony stimulating factor, interleukin 2, erythropoietin, as well as numerous other lymphokines. There is substantial interest in the isolation, purification and characterization of these blood components because of their possible use in treatment, as well as their use in elucidating such diseases as cancer. There are many pitfalls in isolating a naturally occurring factor. A system of separation must be developed which separates the desired factor from other factors which are present and may have similar characteristics. Secondly, some means for assaying the various fractions must be provided which specifically or substantially specifically characterizes the material of interest, in contrast to the other materials which are present. Where the polypeptide of interest has extraordinarily high activity, the difficulty of isolating the desired product is greatly enhanced. Thirdly, one must provide procedures which do not detrimentally affect the product of interest, particularly avoiding any denaturation. In addition, there are frequently other materials in the composition which may act upon the material of interest, changing it, so that the product which is ultimately obtained, which may have some of the desired activity, is not the naturally occurring material. Finally, after isolating the desired component in sufficiently pure form, one must then attempt to physically characterize the polypeptide, for example, by amino acid sequencing, glycosylation number, disulfide bridges, and the like. One must further characterize the material as to its physiological characteristics. Finally, even after isolation of the purified compound, characterization of the compound s physiological activity may often prove to be elusive. Since in many situations the activity may be dependent upon the presence of one or more other compounds, a narrow concentration range, particular host cells, or the like, substantial intuitive effort as well as extended experimentation is frequently required to discover a compound s physiological activity and demonstrate the parameters affecting its activity. Holley Polypeptide compositions and their use are provided which are characterized by having at least one of the following properties capable of inhibiting tumor growth, while not inhibiting normal cell growth capable of stimulating pp60 src autophosphorylation capable of inducing secretion of a 52kDal protein from tumor cells and having a substantially equivalent amino acid sequence of at least a portion of a polypeptide isolatable from mammalian platelets and exhibiting at least one of the previously indicated properties. The polypeptides are provided in substantially pure form. Fig. 1, which is enclosed for explanatory purposes only, is a chart comparing the effect of Oncostatin A on the growth of a tumor in athymic mice. Compositions comprising polypeptides according to claims 1 to 3 are provided which effect mammalian neoplastic cell growth inhibition. The subject polypeptides are related to a naturally occurring polypeptide in the ethanolic HCl fraction obtained by extraction of platelets, called in the literature platelet factor 4 and referred to as Oncostatin A hereafter. The polypeptides are stable at moderate temperatures 0 25 C , at a low pH, generally below about pH 3, usually at pH 2. The polypeptides will have at least one biologically active sequence, e.g., immunological or epitopic, and may have more than one biologically active sequence, where such sequence can compete with a naturally occurring product for the biological property. Compositions of interest with the formula depicted in claim 1 will preferably have proximal to the C terminus, a sequence of the formula K K I I K K, more preferably a sequence of the formula K K I I K K L L, and most preferably P L Y K K I I K K L L E S. Also, insertions or deletions may be involved, where usually insertions or deletions will involve from 1 to 2 amino acids, particularly 1 amino acid. Naturally occurring Oncostatin A has the following sequence The polypeptides of the invention are derivatives of the C terminal portion thereof. The polypeptides compositions of this invention demonstrate a variety of physiological activities. The subject compositions can be used to inhibit tumor growth In addition, Oncostatin A fragments or fusion proteins containing sub sequences fragments having competitive immunological properties can be used to produce monoclonal antibodies or act as a reagent in diagnostic assays for the detection of Oncostatin A or immunologically competitive compounds or the presence of cell surface receptors for Oncostatin A. The subject compounds have high activity for tumor inhibition. The subject compositions can be used The subject compositions can be used The polypeptides of the invention can be formulated in physiologically acceptable carriers, such as phosphate buffered saline, distilled water, excipients, or the like, or may be employed neat. The polypeptides of the invention may be employed indirectly for detecting the presence of neoplastic cells. Where cells are subjected to concentrations of the active agent of from about 1 to 500ng ml, preferably from about 50 to 350ng ml of the active agent, a 52kDal protein p52 is secreted by the neoplastic cells. Thus, one could detect the presence of neoplastic cells by detecting the secretion of p52 into the external medium, e.g., nutrient medium, blood, urine, or other physiological fluid. The polypeptides can therefore be used to monitor the state of a host and the existence or absence of a neoplastic condition. The polypeptides of the invention can be used in diagnosing whether a tumor exists, in monitoring surgery, levels of metastasis, or the like. The polypeptides of the invention would be administered The polypeptides of the invention can also be used to stimulate the immune system, either by itself, but preferably in conjunction with other lymphokines, e.g., interferon, more particularly, γ interferon. Thus, the polypeptides of the invention may be formulated with other polypeptides and administered to a host which is immunosuppressed, so as to stimulate the immune system. Gamma interferon is known to induce Ia expression in monocytes and macrophages, as well as other tissues, such as endothelium and fibroblasts. The polypeptides of the invention induce Ia expression and stimulate the γ interferon Ia induction, enhancing the efficacy of a given dose of γ interferon. The amount of the polypeptides of the invention will generally be employed to provide a concentration in the medium in the range of about 1 to 200, preferably about 2 to 70ng ml. The amount of γ interferon will be conventional as to its use as a lymphokine, generally being in the range of about 0.5 to 200ng ml. Enhancements in expression of Ia of at least about 1.5, usually at least 2 fold, can be achieved with the polypeptides of the invention when used by itself or in conjunction with other lymphokines. Administration may be employed as described previously. The polypeptides of the invention can also be used in conjunction with kinases, particularly pp60 src to change the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Particularly, by contacting the enzyme with small amounts of the polypeptides of the invention, particularly at concentrations of from about 0.05 to 50 µg ml, the kinase activity may be enhanced, including a change in the observed amino acids which are phosphorylated, particularly, besides tyrosine being phosphorylated, serine is also phosphorylated. In this way, the combination of pp60 src or analogous kinases may be used for modifying polypeptides having tyrosine and serine amino acids, by providing for phosphorylation of both tyrosine and serine at enhanced rates. The polypeptides of the invention may also be used as haptens or antigens, as haptens linked to an immunogenic potentiator, e.g., an antigen, particle or the like, for production of monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera. The antibodies can find wide use, particularly for diagnostic purposes. The antibodies may be used by themselves or in conjunction with the polypeptides of the invention as reagents for the detection of Oncostatin A and Oncostatin A receptors, including antibodies to Oncostatin A. A wide variety of protocols and techniques are available for determining analytes of interest. These techniques involve a wide variety of labels, including enzymes, radionuclides, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, enzyme substrates, enzyme inhibitors, particles, and the like. The methods may involve a separation step heterogeneous or no separation step homogeneous . The label may be covalently bonded to either the polypeptides of the invention or the antibody thereto may be conjugated to an antibody directed to the anti Oncostatin A fragment having, for example, the Fc of the anti Oncostatin A. The whole antibody may be used or fragments thereof, including Fab, F ab The antibodies may be prepared in conventional ways in accordance with the preparation of monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera. In each instance, an appropriate host will be injected with an immunogen having one or more epitopic sites of interest, usually followed by one or more booster injections. For polyclonal antisera, the host may be bled and the globulin fraction isolated. The globulin fraction may be further purified by affinity chromatography. For monoclonal antibodies, the host will be immunized as before, but in this instance the spleen will normally be removed and fused with an appropriate fusion partner. After selection of hybridomas expressing the desired antibody, the hybridomas will be subjected to limiting dilution, followed by selection and cloning, and further characterization. The antibodies according to this invention may be any of the types which naturally occur, such as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, particularly IgM and the various subtypes of IgG, i.e., IgG1, 2, 3 or 4. The resulting monoclonal antibodies can be used as immunogens for production of anti idiotype antibodies which will have conformational similarity to the polypeptides of the invention. These may then be used as substitute reagents for Oncostatin A type materials in a variety of applications. The parent compound, Oncostatin A, which does not form part of the present invention, can be obtained by extraction of platelets with approximately 0.3M ethanolic hydrochloric acid. As inhibitors against degradation, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin may also be included, the former at levels of about 1 10 by weight of the extracting composition and the latter at levels of about 0.1 1TIU mg TIU trypsin inhibition units of the extracting composition. After raising the pH to about 5, using aqueous ammonium hydroxide, a small amount of ammonium acetate is added and the solution clarified by centrifugation or other convenient means. The protein is then precipitated by successively employing cold ethanol 95 and ether, the precipitate collected and dialyzed against 0.1 0.5M acetic acid employing a dialysis membrane having a cutoff below about 3,000Mr. The residue is lyophilized, resuspended in 1M acetic acid, clarified and is then ready for further purification by gel permeation chromatography employing Biogel P 10. The product is eluted with about 1M acetic acid and the various fractions monitored employing an appropriate assay technique, e.g., tumor growth inhibition. The fractions having the growth inhibiting activity are lyophilized, resuspended in dilute aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2 3, clarified and then chromatographed on a high pressure, liquid chromatograph, where the silica packing has a coating of a long aliphatic chain of from about 16 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g., 18 carbon atoms. The column is equilibrated with dilute trifluoroacetic acid 0.02 0.1 and the product eluted with an acetonitrile gradient of up to 60 acetonitrile in dilute 0.01 0.1, usually about 0.04 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid. A relatively slow flow rate is employed, generally about 0.5 to 1ml min at ambient temperatures. The fractions may be assayed by the bioassay indicated previously or other bioassays. For further purification, the product obtained from the column may be purified utilizing high pressure gel exclusion chromatography. The major peak of Oncostatin A activity resolved by Novapak C₁₈ reverse phase Liquid chromatography is lyophilized and resuspended in 100 µl of 40 acetonitrile containing 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid. The sample is injected into a hydroxylated polyether gel column Bio Rad TSK 250 and eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 40 acetonitrile in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of each fraction are lyophilized and tested for Oncostatin A activity tumor cell inhibition activity coelutes with the major peptide peak Rf 0.9 , which also corresponds in molecular weight to that of the 6,000Mr insulin marker used to calibrate this chromatographic system. The product obtained from the column may be electrophoresed employing SDS PAGE. The band at about 6,000 8,000 molecular weight is isolated. The band is shown to have strong growth inhibitory activity against neoplastic mammalian cells. Conveniently, a synthetic gene may be synthesized. By employing a synthetic gene substantial flexibility is achieved in that host preferred codons may be employed and unique, or rare restriction sites may be introduced. The restriction sites add a degree of flexibility in modifying various portions of the gene, introducing deletions, transitions, transversions, insertions, and the bike. A strategy is devised employing single stranded overlapping fragments which can be mixed together in a hybridizing ligating medium without interfering heteroduplex formation. The resulting double stranded gene may then be cloned and purified. An exemplary sequence is set forth in the experimental section. Desirably, the termini of the gene are different to ensure the proper orientation upon insertion. The gene may be inserted into an appropriate expression vector for expression. A large number of vectors are available for expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such as fungi, e.g., yeast, mammalian cells, e.g., mouse cells, primate cells, etc. The replication system may be derived from plasmids, viruses or chromosomes. Illustrative replication systems include ColE1, lambda, RSF1010, 2 µm plasmid, SV40, adenovirus, papilloma bovine virus, etc. Besides at least one replication system, where episomal maintenance is desired no replication system is required if integration is desired , a marker will usually be present which allows for selection of the host containing the desired gene. The marker will usually provide biocide resistance, e.g., antibiotics or heavy metals or complementation, prototrophy to an auxotrophic host. One or more markers may be present, usually not more than three. The structural gene will be located, usually by insertion into a polylinker a sequence having a plurality of restriction sites , between transcriptional and translational initiation and termination regulatory regions recognized by the expression host. By appropriate choice of the transcriptional initiation region, transcription may be constitutive or inducible. A large number of promoter regions have been isolated and shown to be useful, such as the In addition, a fused gene may be prepared by providing a 5 sequence to the structural gene which encodes a secretory leader and processing signal. Illustrative secretory leaders which have been described include the secretory leaders of penicillinase, The construct containing the structural gene and flanking regions providing regulations of expression may be introduced into the expression host by any convenient means, e.g., transformation, with for example, calcium phosphate precipitated DNA, transfection, transduction, conjugation, microinjection, etc. The host may then be grown to a high density in an appropriate nutrient medium. Where the promoter is inducible, permissive conditions will then be employed, e.g., temperature change, exhaustion or excess of a metabolic product or nutrient, or the like. Where the product is retained in the host, the cells are harvested, lysed and the product isolated and purified by extraction, precipitation, chromatography, electrophoresis, etc. Where the product is secreted, the nutrient medium may be collected and the product isolated by conventional ways, e.g., affinity chromatography. Besides being used for expression the structural gene sequences may be used as probes for hybridization and detection of duplexing sequences. For example, the presence and amount of mRNA may be detected in host cells. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and do not form part of the invention. Abbreviations DMEM Dulbecco s modified eagle s medium PBS phosphate buffered saline P S penicillin streptomycin 0.57mg ml each FCS fetal calf serum SDS PAGE sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The precipitate was collected by centrifuging at 8K rpm type 19 rotor for 30min and the pellet was suspended in about 10 20ml of 1M acetic acid. The acetic acid dispersion was dialyzed extensively against 5L X 2 changes of 0.2M acetic acid in a Spectrapor dialysis membrane 3 tubing cutoff 3,500Mr American Scientific Products . The extract was lyophilized, resuspended in 7.5ml of 1M acetic acid, followed by centrifuging at 30K rpm. Biogel P 10 200 400 mesh Bio Rad Labs was swelled overnight in 1M acetic acid, degassed thoroughly and then poured into a 100x2.5cm siliconized glass column and allowed to equilibrate overnight with 1M acetic acid. All solutions were degassed before using. The acid ethanol solubilized peptides 50 70mg of protein from 25g of human platelets were dissolved in 7.5ml of 1M acetic acid and applied to the above column. Fractions 3.5ml were collected and aliquots were lyophilized and tested for inhibition of 5 ¹²⁵I iodo 2 deoxyuridine incorporation into A549 human lung carcinoma cells. The fraction containing the peak of tumor growth inhibitory activity about 200ng of protein from the above column was lyophilized and resuspended in 0.05 v v of trifluoroacetic acid. The column was then eluted with a linear 0.60 gradient of acetonitrile in 0.045 triluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8ml min at 23 C. Aliquots of each fraction were lyophilized and assayed in triplicate, as described above. The fraction s containing the inhibitory activity were then dissolved in 40 acetonitrile containing 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a hydroxylated polyether gel column Bio Rad TSK 250 and eluted with a mobile phase of 40 acetonitrile in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were collected, lyophilized and assayed in triplicate for growth inhibitory activity. The activity elutes in the fraction where the insulin marker elutes and corresponds to a molecular weight of 6 8kDal. Those fractions having the highest activity were then electrophoresed employing SDS PAGE as follows. The peptide corresponding to the major Oncostatin A activity from the reverse phase HPLC purification step was lyophilized, resuspended and boiled 2min in 0.03ml of a sample preparation buffer containing 12.5mM Tris Cl pH 6.7, 4 SDS, 10 β mercaptoethanol, 20 glycerol and 0.01 bromphenol blue. The sample was loaded onto a 5 polyacrylamide stacking gel poured over a 17 to 27 polyacrylamide gradient slab gel containing 0.1 SDS, at pH 8.8. The get was run at 10 milliamps until samples migrated through the stacking gel and at 20 milliamps until the dye front migrated to the bottom of the gel. Gels were fixed and stained overnight in a solution of 0.2 Coomassie blue, 50 methanol and 9 acetic acid. Following destaining, Coomassie positive bands were localized utilizing a Hoffer densitometer. Markers included insulin 6,000Mr , trypsinogen 24,500Mr , RN ase 13,700Mr , and aprotinin 6,500Mr . The major peptide comigrated with the 6,500Mr aprotinin standard under these conditions of electrophoresis. The assay employed was as follows On day 2 in the morning A549 cells human lung carcinoma in Nunc 96 well plates Kamstrupvej 90. DK 4,000, Roskilde, Denmark were set up. These cells were passaged when there were fewer than 30. Into all but the peripheral wells was introduced 45,000 cells 50 µl well 9x10⁴ cells per ml DMEM with 10 FCS, P S, glutamine . The peripheral wells received 50 µl PBS and the entire plate was incubated at 37 C. In the afternoon, the test samples were resuspended in DMEM with 10 FCS, P S, glutamine triplicate testing. Into each test well was delivered 50 µl, while control wells received 50 µl DMEM and the plate incubated at 37 C for 3 days. On day 4, into each well 50ml of a solution of ¹²⁵I odo 2 deoxyuridine 4Ci mg 0.5mCi ml 1 µl isotope ml DMEM containing 10 FCS, P S, glutamine and the plate incubated at 37 C overnight. On day 5, the medium was aspirated from the wells, washed 1X with PBS, 100 µl methanol added, the methanol allowed to stand for 10min followed by aspiration of the methanol. To the wells was then added 200 µl, 1M sodium hydroxide, the plate incubated for 30min at 37 C and then 1M sodium hydroxide removed with Titertek plugs Flow Labs . The plugs were then counted in a gamma counter for radioactivity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Oncostatin A prepared above, the following test was carried out. The test is referred to as soft agar colony inhibition. The materials employed are 5 agar 3.75g Nobel agar Difco , 75ml of distilled water autoclaved in a 125ml Wheaton bottle, DMEM with 10 FCS, 100U penicillin, 100U streptomycin, 200mM glutamine, and human melanoma cells A375 . Materials to be tested are lyophilized in a sterile 12x75mm test tube. A 1 10 dilution of the 5 agar is made with DMEM and heated to 46 C in a water bath. A base layer is prepared by pipetting 1ml of 0.5 agar solution into each well of a 6 well culture plate 35x14mm . The layer is allowed to stand at room temperature until it hardens. SA₆ cells are prepared by trypsinizing and the number of cells counted. The cells are diluted to a final concentration of 1x10⁴ cells per ml and 0.35ml of cells is added to each test sample tube. Into each of ten test sample tubes is pipetted 0.750ml of a 0.5 agar solution, the mixture vortexed gently and the contents of the test sample tube test sample, cells, agar is poured onto the base layer and allowed to stand for about 20min at room temperature until the agar hardens. The plates may then be stored in a 37 C humidified incubator with 5 carbon dioxide. The plates are checked for inhibition of colony growth after 3 days and up to 10 days depending on the potency of the test material. The number of colonies is counted in 8 random low power microscope fields. When plates are to be maintained longer than 5 days, another 1ml layer of 0.3 agar solution is overlayed on the test sample layer to prevent drying of the test sample layer. The above procedure was employed using varying concentrations of the purified Oncostatin A. The following table indicates the results, the amount of Oncostatin A indicated being the lyophilized amount introduced into the test tube. The results are reported as percent maximal inhibition. It is evident from the above results, that the subject polypeptide is a potent inhibitor of cell growth. Based on the results observed with the melanoma cells, about 1ng is sufficient to provide about 50 inhibition. The subject compound can, therefore, find a wide variety of uses in inhibiting cellular growth, including neoplastic cellular growth. For example, the subject compound also inhibits a variety of cultured human tumor cells, but not normal non neoplastic human foreskin fibroblasts, as evidenced in the following table. Young 8 10 weeks athymic mice were injected subcutaneously in the inguinal region with 5x10⁶ human lung carcinoma cells A549 suspended in 100 µl of phosphate buffered saline PBS . Seven days post inoculation palpable tumors developed 2.5 3.0mm in diameter tumor bearing mice were randomly selected from this population and injected on day 7 subcutaneously on the tumor site with 50 µl of PBS containing 0.30 µg of Oncostatin A purified to homogeneity from human platelets, as described previously. Injection of tumor bearing control mice with PBS without Oncostatin A did not effect tumor growth. Tumor bearing mice were then subsequently injected with an equivalent dose of Oncostatin A in 50 µl of PBS at days 11 and 16 post inoculation of A549 cells. These doses of Oncostatin A were injected directly into the tumor mass utilizing a 30½ g needle. Tumor size was monitored at the days indicated by measuring tumors in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions with calipers a tumor size noted on the ordinate represents multiples of these two dimensions. The results are depicted in Fig. 1. Human lung carcinoma cells A549 were treated with Oncostatin A 200ng ml of culture and the effect on polypeptides released into the cell culture supernatant was determined. Treated and control cultures no Oncostatin A were pulsed with ³⁵S methionine 5µCi ml S.A. 800Ci mmol at time 0 addition of Oncostatin A or medium only control . Twelve hours later culture supernatants were removed and clarified first at low speed 1,500xg for 15min then at high speed 30,000xg for 1hr . Polypeptides were precipitated from clarified supernatants with trichloroacetic acid TCA followed by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5 acrylamide slab gels. Radioautography of the gel demonstrated the presence of a 52,000Mr ³⁵S methionine labeled polypeptide in supernatants derived from A549 cells treated with Oncostatin A, whereas untreated cancer cells released minimum amounts of this protein at least a ten fold increase was seen after Oncostatin A treatment . No other qualitative or quantitative differences were seen between treated or control cultures. pp60 src was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described Erickson Wehi 3 is a mouse macrophage cell line which can be induced by gamma interferon γ IFN to express H2 class II antigens. The features of this induction have been studied by several laboratories and shown to be an accurate replica of normal macrophage induction. These cells were grown either with or without a low amount of γ IFN with several concentrations of platelet Oncostatin A. Both in the presence or absence of γ IFN, Oncostatin A showed a dose dependent enhancement of class II antigen as measured by direct immunofluorescence on a FACS. The magnitude of the Oncostatin A effect was generally twofold at the concentrations employed 2 70ng ml . The procedure for cross linking Oncostatin A to bacterial lipopolysaccharide is a modification of the method developed by Primi and Cazenave, Ten ng of Oncostatin A and 12.5ng of bacterial lipopolysaccharide LPS Sigma L 263 was diluted to a volume of 500 µl with distilled water. Fifty µl of 2.5 glutaraldehyde in PBS was added and the mixture was incubated for 30min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of 2M glycine in PBS and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 1hr. The Oncostatin A LPS conjugate was diluted with 10ml of mixed lymphocyte conditioned medium and a filter sterilized for use in an Non immune splenocytes were immunized Mixed lymphocyte conditioned MLC medium was prepared by culturing equal numbers of Balb c and C57 black mouse thymocytes in DMEM containing 2 rabbit serum at 4x10⁶ cells ml for 48hr. The medium was collected and stored at 20 C. Peritoneal exudate cells PEC were collected by flushing a thioglycollate treated Balb c mouse with sterile PBS. The PEC cells here placed in culture with 1 mouse equivalent of splenocytes and 10ml of MLC medium containing 10ng of Oncostatin A LPS conjugate. The cells were cultured for 7 days. The immune splenocytes were collected and fused with SP2 0 myeloma cells at a ratio of 1 1 to produce hybridomas which synthesize Oncostatin A specific monoclonal antibodies. The hybridomas were tested for production of Oncostatin A antibodies by an enzyme linked immunoassay ELISA . Positive hybridomas were cloned twice by limiting dilution. Clones were expanded, tested for immunoglobulin class, and injected into Balb c mice for ascites production. Forty positive hybridoma clones were initially expanded and retested for anti Oncostatin A activity. Seven of the most reactive clones were used to produce ascites fluid in Balb c mice. The remaining clones were expanded and frozen. The ascites were tested for specificity against Oncostatin A, an Oncostatin A peptide KLH conjugate and BSA in an ELISA. The ascites reacted with both Oncostatin A and to a lesser extent Oncostatin A peptide at dilutions of 1 to 3,000. The immunoglobulins were purified by caprylic acid precipitation method described by Russo, Oncostatin A was diluted in 0.1M acetic acid and 10ng well was pipetted into a 96 well Dynatech Immulon plate. The solution was dried down overnight at room temperature. The plate was blocked by incubation of the wells with 2.5 BSA, 2.5 fetal bovine serum FCS in PBS at 37 C for 1hr. The plate was then washed twice with 2.5 FCS in PBS. The hybridoma medium, immunoglobulin or antiserum was then added at the appropriate dilution. The plates were then incubated at 37 C for two hours and washed three times with 2.5 FCS in PBS. Vector labs avidin biotin HRP ELISA reagents were used according to the manufacturers directions. The wells were washed with 2.5 FCS in PBS between each step. The positive wells were visualized by the addition of 0.4mg ml Balb c mice were immunized with nitrocellulose immobilized Oncostatin A. The purpose of this immunization protocol is to avoid rapid clearance of the polypeptide by the host. In this way, immunization can be effected by very small amounts of Oncostatin A. A solution of Oncostatin A in 0.1M acetic acid was dotted onto small pieces of nitrocellulose Schleicher Schuell, 0.45 µm and allowed to dry. The pieces of nitrocellulose were placed into the peritoneal cavity of three Balb c mice for the initial immunization 0.375ng mouse . The mice were also given an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1ml complete Freund s adjuvant. The mice were boosted twice at two week intervals with Oncostatin immobilized nitrocellulose. For boosts, the nitrocellulose was chopped up, homogenized with 0.1ml water and 0.1ml incomplete Freund s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously 0.125ng mouse . The mouse sera were tested for specificity against Oncostatin A by the ELISA assay previously described, with horseradish peroxidase conjugated protein A used as the second step reagent. The sera were tested against Oncostatin A peptide KLH conjugate and a blocked plate to show specificity. The following sequence was prepared in accordance with conventional ways The sequence is designed for usage in The plasmid ptrpED5 1 Hallewell and Entage, The Oncostatin A gene is ligated to the linearized ptrpED5 1 plasmid to provide plasmid ptrp Onc A and the ligation mixture is used to transform It is evident from the above results that the subject compounds find a wide variety of applications. Particularly, the compounds can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic states. In therapy, the compounds can provide for the slowing of tumor cell growth, so as to be used jointly with other modes of treatment for the destruction of tumor cells. For diagnosis, the subject compounds are found to induce the production of p52, so that upon administration of the subject compounds to a host, enhanced levels of p52 would be indicative of the presence of tumor cells. This can be very important during the treatment of a neoplastic state to determine whether the removal of the tumor cells has been successful or metastases have occurred. The subject compounds can also be used as reagents in diagnostic assays for the presence of Oncostatin A or Oncostatin A receptors. An example for a polypeptide of the invention is contained in additional technical information submitted after the filing of the present application.
