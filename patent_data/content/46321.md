# Method of arranging a sealing ring in a rolling bearing, and sealing ring to which said method may be applied.

## Abstract
Seal retainers normaly have to be mounted with press fit in bearing rings. This connection requires high tolerances i.e. special machining of the fitting parts. Besides less contact between seal lip and bearing sur face can develop after some running periods. To avoid the above indicated disadvantages it has been found that the improved retainer fulfils two requi rements a its flange part 3 has to be conical shaped at an angle between 2 5 . b the outer diameter on the intersection between line of ring surface 5 and line from touching point 4 at mounting of said flange part 3 has to be at least equal or larger than the inner diameter Di of the bearing ring 6 .
