# Manually operable fastener.

## Abstract
A manually operable quick action fastener, intended for both sporting and industrial use, consists essentially of a single length of wire which is formed into a closed triangular torsion spring having its torsion coils within the triangular shape and whose ends are formed, at the base of the triangle, into a closing hook and a locking arm. Other embodiments allow the closing hook to be strengthened by double winding or resin cladding, or both, and for higher load bearing models the wire winding of the basic triangular shape is modified to produce deflection limiting ends which allow the complete fastener to interlock and bear loads approaching the elastic limit of the material without slip of the parts.
