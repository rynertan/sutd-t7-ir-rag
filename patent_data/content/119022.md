# Belt conveyor arrangement.

## Abstract
A continuous belt 14 has upper and lower runs 14a, 14b and is supported by upper and lower runs 23a, 23b of steel ropes 23 carried and driven by rollers 12, 13 . The ropes 23 are supported on wheels 22 carried by a frame 11 . Rollers 30 invert the lower run of the belt and lead it onto the lower run of the ropes. Magnetic members 50 are secured to the belt and hold the belt relative to the ropes to inhibit relative movement and reduce wear.
