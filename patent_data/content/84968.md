# Weighing method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a weighing method and apparatus for char ging articles to be weighed into a plurality of weighting hoppers 12d , measuring the weights or batches of the charged articles by weight sensors 12e , selecting, based on the measured weight or each article batch, a combination of the articles batches giving a total weight closest to a target weight value, and discharging the selected article batches from the weighing hoppers 12d . In charging articles into the weighing hoppers, the weighing method includes a charging step of so controlling a dispersing feeder 11, 12a as to charge the articles into the weighing hoppers with a target charge quantity, obtained from the number of weighing hoppers and the target weight value, serving as the target of the charging operation. The result can be a highly accurate weighing operation. The weight of articles charged into an auxiliary hopper 41e, 42e is decided based on the extent to which the weights of unselected articles batches deviate from the target weight value, control being so effected as to minimize the deviation for the overall system.
