# A drum for separating castings and molding sand or the like.

## Abstract
A rotating drum 1 for cooling and separating castings and molding sand has a foraminous liner 27, 8 . In a first part 28 thereof there are sand raising vanes 17 between this liner 27 and the closed wall 28 of the drum to raise sand, passing through the perforations in this liner part 28 to spray it over the castings. In a second, more downstream part 8 of the liner this liner part 8 intersects the theoretical sand level 13, 14 to lift the castings from the sand, so as to discharge the castings via liner part 9 and discharge edge 10 separately from the sand. The sand separated from the castings is taken up in a closed end part 5, 7 of the drum 1 having a discrete discharge edge 11 for discharging the sand at the downstream end in a narrow zone. This gives a drum with high cooling and separating capacity and efficien cy with the least possible noise and dust generation.
