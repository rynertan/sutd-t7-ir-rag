# Process for purification of gases containing elemental sulphur.

## Abstract
Gases containing elemental sulphur as an impurity are purified to remove said sulphur by contacting the gas with sulphur trioxide in a pool of oleum at a temperature of 82 C to 121 C. it may also be purified to remove any carbonaceous material present. In one embodiment, shown in the single figure of the drawing, the process is used to remove elemental sulphur from sulphur dioxide produced by reaction of molten sulphur 3 with sulphur trioxide. A portion of the sulphur trioxide is by passed 6 and introduced into the overhead line 5 of the sulphur dioxide reactor 4 . The gases are purified in a second reactor 11 containing a pool of oleum 10 .
