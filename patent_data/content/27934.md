# Improved apparatus for printing and applying pressure sensitive labels.

## Abstract
A feed wheel 72 advances a release liner supporting the labels. A brake 96 prevents movement of the label stock 35 during application of a label. A ratchet 94 and pawl 92 arrangement incrementally advances the feed wheel each time a hand lever 54 is returned to its rest position. At the same time, a second ratchet 168 and pawl 162 arrangement is effective to remove the brake during the incremental label stock advancement. The feed and brake release ratchets are preferably inte grally connected to opposite sides of the feed wheel. Mechanisms are also provided for ensuring removal of the brake prior to incremental label stock advancement and for manually iatching the brake in its released position during loading of label stock in the apparatus. An inking roller mechanism 65 for the apparatus print head 62 includes a latching mechanism 214 which in a first position latches the ink roll in place and in a second, non latching position permits removal and re placement of the ink roll without tools. Further, the print head construction is such that one of a different number of print heads may be secured into the apparatus, again without tools. Further, the print head includes a plurality of print bands 310 mounted on upper and lower drive gears 312, 314 where the lower drive gears are hex agonal in shape. A selector shaft 340 which may be shifted to a selected print band and then rotated to rotate the print band to a selected position includes a selector shaft detenting means 350, 354 which detents the shaft close to the axis thereof.
