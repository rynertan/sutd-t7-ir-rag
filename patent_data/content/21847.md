## Description
LONG ACTING SULFONAMIDE INJECTABLE COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to sulfonamide solutions suitable for pharmaceutical use. More particularly, it relates to aqueous injectable solutions of sulfadimethoxine or sulfamethazine in 2 pyrrolidone or N methylpyrrolidone. Parenteral solutions of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim containing the following water miscible solvents are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,551,564 polyethyleneglycol ethers of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, diethylacetamide, 1,2 propyleneglycol, di 1,2 propyleneglycol , 1,3 butylene glycol1 glycerol formal, diethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol containing 2 15 ethylene oxide groups. U.S. Patent No. 3,985,876 discloses solutions of trimethoprim with various sulfonamides, including sulfamethoxazole and sulfadoxine in a mixture of 10 60 water and 30 90 organic solvents such as dimethyl and diethylacetamide, dimethyl formamide, dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol formal and various glycols. U.S. Patent No. 4,018,889 discloses oxytetracycline solutions containing from about 1 to 40 oxytetracycline in an aqueous vehicle containing from about 10 to 50 by weight of 2 pyrrolidone, about 0.8 to 1.3 molar proportions of a pharmaceutically acceptable magnesium compound soluble in the said solution, said solution having a pH value in the range of from about 7.5 to 9.5. This invention discloses a long acting liquid sulfonamide injectable composition comprising a water b from 5 to 25 w v based on the total volume of the solution of a sulfonamide selected from sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine and c 40 to 65 w v based on the total volume of the solution of a co solvent selected from 2 pyrrolidone and N methylpyrrolidone, the composition having a pH of from 5 to 9.5. The sulfonamides utilized in the compositions of this invention are sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine. They are present in concentrations of from 5 to 25 w v. The preferred concentration for sulfadimethoxine is 10 to 20 w v and 15 to 20 w v for sulfamethazine. Sulfadimethoxine is also known as N1 2,6 dimethoxy 4 pyrimidinyl sulfanilamide and sulfamethazine is also known as N1 4,6 dimethyl 4 pyrimidinyl sulfanilamid 2 Pyrrolidone or N methylpyrrolidone is present as a co solvent in a concentration of from 40 to 65 w v.The preferred concentration for 2 pyrrolidine is from 50 to 65 w v and 40 to 65 for N methyl pyrrolidine. The pH value of these compositions is adjusted if necessary to pH 5 to 9.5. The pH can be adjusted by means of a base that is pharmaceutically acceptable, such as monoethanolamine. As an optional. ingredient polyvinylpyrrolidone, having 8 molecular weight of between about ski 000 and 100,000 K 12 to 30 , may also be present in these compositions in a concentration of from 1 to 5 w v. The polyvinylpyrrolidone most preferred for this invention is one having an average molecular weight of about 10,000 17,000 where Value 17 . It is present in part as a co solubilizer and may improve tissue toleration. As optional co solvents ingredients such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, benzyl alcohol, dimethylacetamide, ethyl lactate and glycerol formal may be present at concentrations of from 0.5 to 30t w v. The stability of these solutions for therapeutic administration is still further enhanced by use of an antioxidant such as monothioglycerol at levels of from 0.1 to 1 w v. The primary application of these sulfonamide compositions is as a parenteral composition. The sulfonamide antibiotic compositions of this invention are easy to syringe over a wide temperature range and are satisfactory from a physical and chemical stability standpoint. These solutions produce prolonged efficacious blood levels and are well tolerated in contrast to the short term blood levels and tissue damage routine experienced with presently available highly alkaline aqueous sulfonamide solutions. The compositions of this invention are preferably prepared by mixing the co solvent with water and other co solvents, if present. The sulfonamide is then added and stirred until a clear solution results. The pH is then adjusted to the desired range. If polyvinylpyrrolidone is to be. included, it is added to the water at the t√Øme of mixing the co solvent.
