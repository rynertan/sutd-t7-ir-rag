# Impact fuse for a ballistic projectile.

## Abstract
A resonant mechanical system 24, 31 is interposed between a firing pin 25, 26 and the site of impact of raindrops with said resonant mechanical system having a natural period which is long compared to the duration of impact of any raindrop so that the fuse renders insensitive to raindrop impact.
