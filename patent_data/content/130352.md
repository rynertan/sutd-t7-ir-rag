# CONTROL OF A FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION PROCESS

## Abstract
In a fractional distillation process in which it is desired to maintain a desired ASTM end point temperature of the overhead liquid product withdrawn from the fractional dis tillation process, changes in the slope of the equilibrium flash vaporization boiling point line are utilized to determine the actual slope of the ASTM boiling point curve at any particular time. The actual ASTM end point temperature for the overhead liquid product is derived based on the actual slope of the ASTM boiling point curve thus determined. The actual ASTM end point temperature is utilized to control the fractional distillation process so as to maintain a desired ASTM end point temperature for the overhead liquid product withdrawn from the fractional distillation process.
