# CARTRIDGE BEARING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
A cartridge bearing unit particularly useful for heavy duty motor vehicle wheel bearing applications features a pair of bearings being axially separated by an inner spacer and an outer housing. The housing has an adjustable axial length which provides for accurate adjustment of bearing clearance. By adjusting and fixing the housing length, bearing clearance is established eliminating the need to adjust clearances upon installation. The entire bearing unit is self contained including a lubricant seal thereby simplifying bearing servicing.
