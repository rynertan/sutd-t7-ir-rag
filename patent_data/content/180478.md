# Heat sealable plastics laminate.

## Abstract
A laminated structure comprises a substrate layer of a crystalline propylene resin and, in direct contact with at least one surface of said substrate layer, a heat sealable layer of a crystalline random propylene copolymer composition composed of I a crystalline random propylene copolymer of a major amount of propylene and a minor amount of another alpha olefin, and II a random copolymer which consists enssentially of more than 60 to 99 mol of propylene and which has A an intrinsic viscosity η , determined in decalin at 135 C, of 0.5 to 6 dl g, B a DSC melting point Tm , measured by a differential scanning calorimeter, of 50 to 130 C, C a degree of crystallinity, measured by X ray diffrac tometry, of 5 to 60 , D a boiling methyl acetate soluble content W₁ of not more than 2 by weight based on the weight of the co polymer II , and E an n decane acetone 1 1 by volume mixture soluble content W₂ of less than 4 η 1.2 in by weight based on the weight of the copolymer II , the weight ratio of I II being 5 95 to 90 10.
