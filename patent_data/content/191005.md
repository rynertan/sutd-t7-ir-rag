## Description
A device for generation of nominal current values in servo drive systems for brushless permanently magne tized synchronous motors Technical field This invention relates to a device at brushless permanently magnetized synchronous motors according to the preamble of claim 1. The device is to provide a servo drive system known per se of the motor with nominal current values. Brushless motors here intended are i.a. utilized for robots and other machines for the industry. State of art A problem with brush less motors of the kind intended here is to create correct nominal current values of the current regulator of the motor. In e.g. a three phase motor with speed control, the three field windings which are reciprocally dephased 120 in order to obtain the necessary flow adaptation, are to be fed with currents from the regulator. It is previously known to arrange a position indicator e.g. a resolver on the motor shaft. The analog output signals of the position indicator are thereafter converted into the corresponding digital values by means of a converter and these are supplied tc a three phase torque angle generator which emits signals corresponding to the torque angle of the different phases.By modulating these signals by a nominal value of the current from a superordinated regulation system the desired nominal current values of the current regulator of the motor can be obtained. The units in the feed back loop thus formed from position indicator to regulator will as a rule be relatively complicated due to the included units. Summary of the invention It is the object of the present invention to provide a simplified circuit device in the feed back loop between the position indicator of the brush less motor or the motor shaft and its current regulator. The device is characterized as is apparent from the characterizing portion of claim 1. Brief description of drawings The invention will be described more in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein Fig. 1 shows a simplified block diagram of the circuit device according to the invention as well as motor and associated current regulator, Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of an alternative embodiment of the circuit device according to the invention, Fig. 3 shows more closely the appearance of a position indicator included in the diagram according to Fig. 1, and Fig. 4 shows a circuit diagram of the electronic circuits of the position indicator. Embodiments In Fig. 1, a three phase brushless permanently magnetized synchronous motor M with its three field windings 11, 12, 13 is shown as an example. A current regulator SR of a design known per se is connected with its outputs to the field windings 11 13 of the motor in order to supply a regulated current to these. In this way the intended flow distribution in the air gap of the motor is achieved, whereby the desired torque is obtained at the regulation and upon variation of the motor load. A position indicator L is connected to the shaft of the motor indicated by the dashed line in order to sense the position of the motor shaft.The position indicator L can preferably be mounted on the motor shaft, i.e. mechanically connected to this, but another form of coupling is also possible e.g. an inductive one . In the case described here with three phase windings the position indicator L will emit three output quantities, the currents IA, 1B and IC mutually having the same phase position 1200 as the motor windings 11, 12, 1 i.e. fo 1A has the phase 0 0 position 0 1B has the phase position 120 and IC the phase position 2400. Moreover, the number of poles should be the same in the position indicator as in the motor.The number of poles of the motor can be 2, 4, 6 or 8. The motor can also be a 2 phase or 4 phase one. The position indicator L, which is described more in detail in connection with Fig. 3 is connected with its three outputs to one input of each three multiplier circuits M1,M2 and M3. A speed regulation device VR of a type known per se is connected to the other input of each of these circuits. The regulator VR emits a current quantity I which is mul v tiplied in the multipliers analogously with the relative output quantity IA, 1B and IC from the position indicator. The current quantity I is a nominal current value of the v current of the motor. The regulator VR can also consist of a position regulator. The three outputs of the multiplier circuits are connected to the nominal value inputs of the current regulator of the motor. The current values IA, IB, IC of the three phase motor received from the position indicator L with a mutual phase shift of 120 electric degrees are thus multiplied in three analog multiplier circuits M7 M3 bv the nominal current value I emitted from the speed regulation device V VR. After this multiplication, three signals are obtained which are dephased 120 and are nominal current values.These values are fed to three current control circuits included in the current regulator SR and fed back by the nominal current values to the field windings 1 1 of the motor in conventional manner. The motor M will then receive field currents, in this case three different ones, the amplitudes and relative phase positions of which each are the product of the signals from the position indicator of the motor and the nominal current value generated by the speed regulation device. The system shown in Fig. 1 can be used both for 1and 4 quadrant operation of the motor M. Another somewhat simplified embodiment of the circuit device according to Fig. 1 is shown in the block diagram according to Fig. 2. The third sensing member of the position indicator has been omitted here and only the two output quantities IA and IB are utilized. As a result of this only two multipliers M1 and M2 are required. The nominal current value from the third multiplier M3 according toFig. 1 can instead be formed by connecting a summation circuit S to the outputs of the two multipliers M1 and M2 and, moreover, an inverting circuit I is connected to the output of the summation circuit S as the third nominal current value derived from the output C of the position indicatorL can be written as IC K I t where K const. 1v and when IA and 1B reciprocally have a phase difference of 1200. Thus, the third nominal current value can be obtained via the output of the inverter by means of the summation circuit S shown in Fig. 2 and the inverter I. Of course it is also possible to connect the summation circuit S and the inverter I directly to the two outputsA and B and the output of the inverter to the multiplierM3 which is thus maintained. An embodiment of the position indicator L will be described in greater detail with reference to Fig. 3. The perspective view according to Fig. 3 shows the motor M, the permanent magnet GM of the position indicator and a fixedly secured plate or washer B carrying the sensing members of the position indicator. The motor M is a brushless threephase synchronous motor having the same number of poles as the sensor magnet GM. The direction of the motor shaft through the sensor magnet GM and the plate B is indicated by the dashed line. In this case the sensing members of the plateB comprise three Hall elements H1, H2, H mounted on the plate 2 that the angle alpha 120 3 plate so that the angle a 120 . The mounting distance be tween plate and magnet is about 0.5 mm.For the sake of simplicity the electric connections to the Hall elements have been omitted in Fig. 3. The Hall element H2 can e.g. be omitted for the embodiment according to Fig. 2 with only two outputs A and B which emit output signals IA, 1B mutually dephased 1200. The angle a between the lines of sight of the Hall elements H1 and U3 is still 1200. The Hall element H2 as well as its associated circuits F2 and resistors will then of course be omitted in the circuit according to Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows how the Hall elements H1 H3 are connected electrically. Each Hall element is included in a voltage divider between 12V and 12V supply voltage. Resistors R1 R6 are connected in the voltage divider, whereby the respectiveHall element is given proper bias. The outputs of the Hall elements H1 H3 are each connected to an operational amplifier connection F1, F2, F3 of a known design. Three sinusoidal quantities which are mutually dephased 120 electric degrees are obtained via each output A, B and C. The position indicator need not necessarily be designed Figs. 3 and 4 to give sinusoidal output signals. It is also possible to use position indicators providing trapezoidal output signals in the device according to the invention. Also other sensing elements than Hall elements are possible in the position indicator L, e.g. other magnetic or photoelectric elements giving an n phase signal n 2,3,4 which is sinusoidal or trapezoidal.
