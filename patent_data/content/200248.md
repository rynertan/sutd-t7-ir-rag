# Slipper

## Abstract
An improved slipper, essentially characterised in that the integrant part of the sole 1 is made of two equal laminar pieces 5,6 of textile material, between which at least a third piece 7 obtained from a layer having a conformation similar to that of above mentioned pieces is included, which layer is of a soft spongy material, in that the said three pieces 5,6,7 are associated together forming a whole, with or without the help of a tape joining and covering their edges and acting as a welt 11 , in that the inegrant part of the top 2 of the slipper presents a similar structure as the sole, with corresponding textile laminar pieces 8,9 and intermediate layer 10 of spongy material, in that in the edges of the sole and toe areas, the tape forming the welt 11 simultaneously makes the junction with the corresponding edges of the top.

## Claims
1. An improved slipper, essentially characterized in that the integrant part of the sole 1 is made of two equal laminar pieces 5,6 of textile material, between which at least a third piece 7 obtained from a layer having a conformation similar to that of above mentioned pieces is included, which layer is of a soft spongy material, in that the said three pieces 5,6,7 are associated together forming a whole, with or without the help of a tape joining and covering their edges and acting as a welt 11 , in that the integrant part of the top 2 of the slipper presents a similar structure as the sole, with corresponding textile laminar pieces 8,9 and intermediate layer 10 of spongy material, in that in the edges of the sole and toe areas, the tape forming the welt 11 simultaneously makes the junction with the corresponding edges of the top.

## Description
The present invention relates to an improved slipper. According to this invention, a slipper has been provided, which presents some features which rend it advantageous with respect to the constructions presently known on the market and intended to similar uses, creating necessary conditions which moreover entails a substantial reduction in cost. As a matter of fact, the proposed slipper is extremely light, presenting such conditions which render it easily washable, comfortable and flexible. Also the visible components of this slipper are made of fabrics able to present different colours tending to improve its appearance. In general, the slipper which is the subject of the present invention comprises two shaped pieces forming the sole and the top. Each of said pieces is composed of two laminar pieces, which are equal in each case, of a textile material, between which at least a portion or layer of spongy material is included. The respective components of the sole and of the top can be brought together at the periphery thereof by means of a tape trimming the edge of the pieces, forming the proper welt in the case of the sole. This welt in turn ensures the junction of the components of the top at the edge corresponding to the sole and toe areas. It has to be noted that the spongy layer could also be incorporated in the reverse side or back of each of the laminar pieces of textile material, facing each other the surfaces of the spongy pieces associated with the indicated laminar portions of textile material. The peripheral unitering of mentioned pieces is made by means of tradional processes of stitching, welding, glueing and the like, alone or in combination. In order to facilitate the explanation a sheet of drawings showing one embodiment as an example is annexed to the present specification. Referring to the figures, one can see an embodiment of a slipper composed of a sole 1 and a top 2, the latter forming the slipper toe 3 and the upper 4. The sole 1 is made of two upper and lower laminar pieces 5 and 6, which are identical and are obtained from a fabric having a suitably proportioned outline, and between which a layer 7 of a soft spongy material of synthetical nature is inserted. The top 2 is also composed of two upper and lower laminar pieces of fabric 8 and 9 with a layer 10 of a soft spongy material inserted thereinbetween. At the edge of the slipper sole, the textile pieces 5, 6, 8 and 9 are joined together along theirs borders with a tape 11 which is reunited to the assembly by means of stitchings 12 or the like. The top 2 comprises at its rear free edge another tape 13 which joins by stitchings 14 the fabrics 8 and 9 of which said top is formed. The lower edge of this top 2 is retained by the tape 11 of the sole 1. The tapes 11 and 13 are made of a textile material, although other materials of similar characteristics could ensure the same function. The layers 7 and 10 could consist of pieces independent from the respective pieces of fabric enclosing them or could be layers fixed to the internal surface of said fabric pieces. The invention is in no way limited to the details such as described because many changes and variants could be made thereto without departing from the scope of this invention.
