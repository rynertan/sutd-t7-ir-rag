# Olefin oxidation process.

## Abstract
Olefins are oxidized to carbonyl compounds, for example, 1 hexene to 2 hexanone, with a Pd Cu alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chloride catalyst and a suitable surfactant in a diluent system comprising at least two liquid phases, wherein at least one liquid phase is an aqueous phase, in the presence of free oxygen. The addition of the surfactant to the system provides an improvement in olefin conversion and selectivity to the corresponding carbonyl compound. Suitable surfactants include, for example, quaternary ammonium halide compounds.
