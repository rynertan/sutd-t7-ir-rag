# Spring mechanism for lid of video cassette.

## Abstract
Spring mechanism for biasing a visor type lid 38 of a cas sette 30 includes a coil spring 50 which fits around a pin 44 that journals the lid 38 to the cassette. One end 62 of the spring 50 has a bent portion which is compressed into a well formed in the cassette such that the tip of the bent portion 62 digs into a surface portion 56 of the well and thus resists removal.
