# Methods and compositions for the treatment of the skin.

## Abstract
Skin regions associated with excess sebum production, eg oily regions, seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff may be treated by the topical application to such regions of a cosmetic composition containing an effective amount of a topically acceptable lithium salt.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A cosmetic composition for topical application to the skin characterized in that it contains a topically acceptable lithium salt. 2. A composition as claimed in claim 1 in the form of a cosmetic cleansing composition. 3. A composition as claimed in claim 2 in the form of a soap, shampoo or cleansing lotion. 4. A composition as claimed in claim 1 in the form of a lipstick, cream or ointment. 5. A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 containing from 0.001 to 30 by weight of lithium ions. 6. A composition as claimed in any one of claims l to 5 wherein said salt is selected from lithium chloride, lithium citrate, lithium acetylsalicylate, lithium orotate and lithium succinate 7. A method of cosmetic treatment of human skin which comprises topically applying to oily regions thereof or to regions susceptible to dandruff a cosmetic composition containing a topically acceptable lithium salt. 8. A method as claimed in claim 7 wherein said composition is a composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6. 9. The use of a topically acceptable lithium salt for the treatment of oily skin or skin subject to dandruff. 10. The use as claimed in claim 9 wherein said salt is contained in a composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6. 11.

## Description
Methods and compositions for the cosmetic treatment of the skin This invention relates to methods for the cosmetic treatment of skin conditions associated with excess sebum production as well as to cosmetic compositions for use in such treatment. US Patent No. 3 639 625 discloses topical compositions containing lithium succinate for the treatment of various skin diseases. In particular, it is stated that the compositions may be useful in the treatment of exfoliative dermatitis, vaginal pruritis, heat rash such as diaper rash, contact dermatitis, poison ivy, acne vulgar is, dry skin conditions, burns and abrasions. I have now found that a variety of topically acceptable lithium salts will reduce the oiliness of the skin surface, apparently due to a reduction in sebum formation. This discovery is particularly surprising in view of the reference in US PatentNo. 3 639 625 to the treatment of dry skin conditions.I have also found that seborrheic dermatitis responds favourably to the application of lithium salts.Moreover, the application of lithium salts to the scalp bas been found to give an anti dandruff effect, dandruff being a condition commonly associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Thus, in one aspect the invention provides a cosmetic composition for topical application to the skin characterized in that in contains a topically acceptable lithium salt. The compositions of the invention may be applied topically to regions of the skin associated with excess sebum production, eg oily skin, seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. Skin regions susceptible to seborrheic dermatitis may also have applied thereto the compositions according to the invention even when sebum secretion is not excessive. Thus in a further aspect the invention provides a method of cosmetic treatment of human skin which comprises topically applying to oily regions thereof or to regions susceptible to dandruff a cosmetic composition containing a topically acceptable lithium salt. The cosmetic compositions of the invention suitably comprise a cosmetic base and it is particularly preferred that the base comprises a cosmetic cleansing composition such as a soap, shampoo or cleansing lotion. Thus, the compositions may take the form of solid or liquid soaps or shampoos including hair shampoos containing the lithium salt and one or more natural or synthetic surfactants optionally together with one or more conventional soap or shampoo additives such as perfumes, colouring agents and the like. Other lithium containing compositions may also be used in the method according to the invention and examples of such compositions include lipsticks, ointments, creams, solutions, lotions, emulsions, suspensions and powders. Any topically acceptable lithium salt may be used according to the invention since it is believed that the nature of the anion in the saltis not important. Examples of such salts include lithium chloride, succinate, citrate, acetylsalicylate and orotate. The compositions for use according to the invention conveniently contain from 0.001 to 30 , and preferably from 1 to 10 , by weight of lithium ions. In a still further aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a cosmetic composition according to the invention which method comprises admixing a topically acceptable lithium salt together with a cosmetic base. In a yet further aspect, the invention provides the use of a topically acceptable lithium salt for the treatment of oily skin or skin subject to dandruff. The following Examples serve to illustrate compositions which may be used in the method according to the invention all percentages are by weight Example 1 Ointment Wool alcohols ointment base BP 92 Lithium succinate 8 Example 2 Cream Aqueous cream base 96 Lithium citrate 4 Example 3 Cosmetic Night Cream Cosmetic night cream base 98 Lithium chloride 2 Example 4 Hair Shampoo Shampoo base 95 Lithium succinate 5 Example 5 Soap Soap base 97 Lithium orotate 3 Example 6 Lipstick Lipstick base 90 Lithium succinate 10
