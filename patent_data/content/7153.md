# IMPROVED PROGRAMMABLE CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A small, low cost, programmable controller is described capable of solving user programs represented in networks having up to seven rows and eleven columns. A column sol ver is utilized to provide efficient and fast solution of the user control network. The programmable controller also solves calculate functions having multiple outputs to facilitate use of the output information in the control program. A programming panel using a CRT display shows one or more selected control networks and, in conjunction with the central processing unit of the programmable controller, pro vides for the insertion of networks between two existing net works. Since the networks are solved by the controller main frame in a sequential fashion, this network insertion allows the user to optimize his or her control program when solution order of the networks is important. The output coil numbers of network rows may also be assigned by the user independent of their placement in the control program to further facilitate programming the control ler. The programming panel includes a movable cursor on the CRT display which, in conjunction with a light emitting diode LED , allows the user to monitor the real time power flow at any particular point in the displayed ladder diagram network. Specialized search features can also be specified by the user to simplify monitoring and de bugging the control program. The present invention relates to programmable control lers used in industrial control applications such as those found to control material handling, metal cutting, packaging, assembly, batch sequencing, grinding, welding, polymer blending and handling, as well as energy management.
