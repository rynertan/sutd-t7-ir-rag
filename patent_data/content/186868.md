## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC ELEMENT AND PROCESS FOR PROVIDING METAL COMPLEX COLOR IMAGES This invention relates to color photography. In particular, it relates to photographic elements containing essentially colorless, immobile, ligand releasing compounds, and to processes of using such elements to provide color images. It is well known in the photographic arts to record color images with photographic elements containing dye providing materials which can be used to provide color images. Although the properties of dyes commonly used to provide such images e.g. azo or azo methine dyes have been optimized over the years, there is a continued search in the art for dyes which provide images having improved stability to heat, light, humidity and chemical reagents. It is known that dye stability can be enhanced by forming metal dye complexes. For example, U. S. Patent 4,142,891 issued March 6, 1979 to Baigrie et al relates to imaging in diffusion transfer assemblages with metal complexed azo dyes. Although metal dye complexes are favorably regarded for their improved stability, most known metallized dyes or dye precursors are already colored at the time of imagewise exposure. If such dyes and silver halide are incorporated in the same layer of a photographic element, the dye will act as an unwanted filter, absorbing a portion of the incident radiation which otherwise would reach the silver halide. This results in a loss of sensitivity i.e. photographic speed . Further, such colored dyes or dye precursors cannot be used in white photographic papers. One way to eliminate the unwanted filtering effect is to have the silver halide and the dye in separate layers while maintaining them in reactive association. While this is a useful and practical solution, it increases the number of layers in the element, making it thicker and presenting manufacturing and imaging inefficiencies. It would, therefore, be desirable to form highly stable color images using dye precursors which are essentially colorless prior to imagewise exposure and development and can be placed in any layer in the element. The present invention overcomes the problems noted above with a photographic element which comprises a support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer. This element is characterized by having associated with the silver halide emulsion layer an essentially colorless, immobile, ligand releasing compound of the structureLIG X. In this structure, LIG is a ligand which is capable of complexing with metal ions to form a metal complex dye, and X is a group which, as a function of silver halide development, is cleaved from LIG. This invention also provides a process of forming a dye image in the element described above which has been imagewise exposed. This process comprises the steps of a developing the element to imagewise cleave the bond between LIG and X as a function of development, and b treating the element with metal ions to form a metal complex dye with LIG and the metal ions. The photographic elements of this invention of this invention can be used to obtain color images of exceptional stability. Further, these elements and the process of using same provide desirable versatility in the placement of the dye providing materials described herein because they are essentially colorless until development with development compositions after imagewise exposure and until treatment with metal ions. Hence, the problems of placement often encountered with known metallized or metallizable dyes can be avoided. The dye providing materials can also be used to provide color masking dyes. The LIG X compounds are essentially colorless, meaning that prior to complexation of theLIG moiety with metal ions to form a visible dye,LIG X exhibits essentially no observable color. That is, LIG X exhibits a low optical density i.e. less than 0.05 , although it may emit or reflect electromagnetic radiation in the non visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, the LIG moiety and the metal ions form a colored dye from a colorless precursor, as opposed to compounds which are merely shifted in their absorption Amax upon complexation with a metal ion to provide a dye of a different color. LIG is a moiety, which when complexed with one or more metal ions, forms a visible dye.Depending on the way LIG and X are joined, this complexation can occur either while LIG and X are joined or after LIG is cleaved from X. In certain embodiments, LIG and X are joined such that LIG is incapable of complexing with metal ions until LIG andX are cleaved. In other words, the metal chelating site on LIG is blocked with X. In other embodiments,LIG and X are joined such that metal LIG complexation can occur without LIG X cleavage. Imagewise release and removal of LIG then allows metal complexation with the remaining LIG moiety still attached to X.In either case, complexation of metal ions with theLIG moiety provides a dye image as a function, either directly or inversely, of silver halide development. Generally, the dyes formed upon complexation of the LIG moiety and metal ions are visibly colored dyes. That is, they absorb electromagnetic radiation in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. between 400 and 700 nm. More than one molecule of a LIG moiety can be complexed with one metal ion. For example, there may be two or threeLIG molecules complexed with a single metal ion.Representative dyes which can be formed are cyan, yellow and magenta dyes. Useful LIG moieties can be obtained from ferroin type compounds such as hydrazones, tetrazolylpyridines, pyridylquinazolines, bis isoquinolines, imines, phenanthrolines, bipyridines, terpyridines, bidiazines, pyridyldiazines, pyridylbenzimidazoles, diazyltriazines, o nitrosoanilines and phenols, tetrazines, triazines described by Schilt et al in the journal Talanta, 15, pp. 475 478 1968 , pyridine derivatives of phenazine and quinoxaline described bySchilt et al in Talanta, 15, pp. 852 855 1968 , substituted benzimidazole derivatives as described bySchilt et al, Talanta, 15, pp. 1055 1058 1968 , oximes of substituted methyl and phenyl 2 pyridyl ketones as described by Schilt et al, Talanta, 16, pp. 448 452 1969 , and the like. Other ligand providing compounds are described in the following Talanta literature articles 16, pp.519 522 1969 , 13, pp. 895 902 1966 , 17, pp.649 653 1970 , 19, pp. 1025 1031 1972 , 21, pp.831 836 1974 , 22, pp. 915 917 1975 , 23, pp.543 545 1976 , 24, pp. 685 687 1977 , 26, pp. 85 89 1979 , pp. 863 865 1981 , 36, pp. 373 376 1979 , 55, pp. 55 58 1980 , 29, pp. 129 132 1982 , and inBlandamer et al, J. Chem. Soc. Dalton, pp. 1001 1008 1978 , and Case, J. Org. Chem., 31, pp. 2398 2400 1966 . The terpyridines are particularly useful for obtaining magenta dyes. In certain embodiments, LIG can have a ballast group which renders LIG nondiffusible in the photographic element during processing. This type of ligand releasing compound can be illustrated asBALL LIG X wherein LIG and X are as defined above, and BALL is an organic nonpolymeric or polymeric group of such molecular size and configuration as to render the compound nondiffusible in a photographic element during development in an alkaline processing composition. Particularly useful ballast groups include long chain alkyl groups e.g. 6 to 30 carbon atoms , as well as aromatic groups phenyl, naphthyl along with alkyl groups. Representative ballast groups include CO C11H23, CO C6H4 t C12H25 , CON C12H25 2, NHSO2Cl6H33, C7Hls, EMI5.1 S02NHC18H37, 0C12H25, EMI5.2 Examples of useful BALL LIG X compounds include EMI6.1 and a polymer having recurring units represented by the structure EMI6.2 wherein x is from 10 to 100 weight percent, and y is from 0 to 90 weight percent. Particularly useful LIG moieties are those derived from compounds represented by the structure EMI7.1 wherein m is 0 or a positive integer of 1 to 3, n and p are independently 0 or 1, and represents a single or double bond. Z is R1 N , OZS S , R1 P , R1 2P or R1 3P , and when Z is R1 2P , n is 1, otherwise n is O. Preferably, m is O or 1 and Z is R1 N . R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen, amino primary, secondary or tertiary , hydroxy, mercapto, alkoxy preferably of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. methoxy, chloromethoxy, ethoxy, octyloxy, alkoxy substituted with imino, etc. , alkyl preferably of 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the nucleus, e.g. methyl, ethyl, chloromethyl, isopropyl, t butyl, heptyl, alkyl substituted with imino, etc. , aryl preferably of 6 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g. phenyl, naphthyl, xylyl, p methoxyphenyl, aryl substituted with imino, etc. , or a heterocyclic moiety preferably having 5 to 20 carbon, nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen atoms in the nucleus, e.g. pyridyl, quinolyl, a heterocycle substituted with imino, etc. . When R6 is a group defined above, p is 1 and is a single bond. Alternatively, if m is 0, R1 and R2,R2 and R3, and R3 and R 4 a taken together, can independently represent the carbon and heteroatoms e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, etc. necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 20 membered mono or polycyclic carbocyclic or heterocyclic group e.g. pyridine, quinolyl, triazinyl, phenanthrolinyl, pyrimidyl, etc. . The heterocyclic nucleus so formed can be substituted with one or more oxo, alkyl, amino, imino, aryl, phosphino e.g. diphenylphosphino , alkoxy, amide, sulfonamide, thio or sulfo groups as defined above, or a heterocyclic group e.g. pyridyl, pyrimidyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, thienyl, etc. . If m is 1, 2 or 3, R1 and R2 R5 and R 6 s and R3 and R 4 s taken together, can independently represent the carbon and heteroatoms e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, etc. necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 20 membered mono or polycyclic heterocyclic nucleus as defined above where m is O. When Rs and R6 are so defined, p is 0 when is a double bond, and p is 1 when is a single bond. If desired, LIG or a ballast group attached to it can contain one or more solubilizing groups, e.g. sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate, hydroxy or phosphate groups. Examples of useful LIG moieties which form color dye complexes with ferrous ions are shown below. In these structures, the point of attachment to X is represented by an unsatisfied bond. The approximate smax of each resulting ferrous ion complex dye is also noted, however, the Amax can be shifted slightly e.g. 10 15 nm depending upon the moiety to which LIG is attached.EMI8.1 yellow, iax 442 nmEMI8.2 yellow, X 443 nm max EMI9.1 yellow, max 441 nm yellow, A 441 nm max magenta, A 564 nm max magenta, A 536 nm max magenta, max 536 nmEMI9.2 EMI10.1 magenta, max 567 nm max magenta, max 583 nm magenta, max 557 nm max cyan, max 644 nmEMI10.2 cyan, max 670 nm and EMI11.1 cyan, iax 650 nm. X is any moiety which will react with oxidized developing agent e.g. oxidized color developing agent . In preferred embodiments, it is a coupler moiety employed in known color forming couplers which yields a colored product on reaction with oxidized color developing agents or which yields a colorless product on reaction with oxidized color developing agents. Both types of coupler moieties are well known to those skilled in the photographic art and described, for example, in ResearchDisclosure, publication 17643, paragraph VII,December, 1978, and references noted therein. However, useful results can be obtained with this invention when X is another moiety known in the art to release dyes, or other photographically useful fragments as a result of silver halide development.Such moieties include redox dye releasers and similar compounds as described, for example, in U. S. Patents 4,053,312, 4,055,429, 4,076,529, 4,139,379, 4,139,389, 4,199,354, 4,199,355, and 4,232,107. X can be unballasted or ballasted with an organic ballasting group as described above for LIG.X can be monomeric, or it can form part of a dimeric, oligomeric or polymeric coupler. The LIG moiety is joined to X at any of the positions from which groups cleaved from couplers by reaction with oxidized developing agent can be attached. Preferably, LIG is attached to X in a coupling position so that upon reaction of the coupler with oxidized developing agent, LIG will be cleaved from X. However, LIG can be in a non coupling position of X, from which position it will be cleaved as a result of reaction of X with oxidized developing agent. In the case where the LIG moiety is in a non coupling position, other groups can be in the coupling position, including the known coupling off groups or the same or a different LIG moiety. Accordingly, the LIG X compounds useful in this invention can provide more than one mole of LIG per mole of compound. The LIG moieties can be the same or different and can be cleaved at the same or different times or rates. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, there is no linking group between X and LIG. The LIG moiety is blocked by X preventing complexation with metal ions, and cleavage by oxidized developer produces only the coupled product resulting from the coupling reaction with the oxidized developer andLIG. Examples of such preferred LIG X compounds are EMI12.1 EMI13.1 Aniono andIn these structures, Z is an electron withdrawing group, Z is an electron withdrawing group, hydrogen, alkyl or aryl, BALL is a suitable ballasting group as defined above, and Anion is a suitable anion. Alternatively, release of LIG and X moieties linked with an organic blocking group BL can occur in several steps wherein the BL LIG fragment is coupled off from the X moiety upon reaction with oxidized developer. The BL LIG fragment is then capable of releasing the LIG moiety by an intramolecular reaction. The compounds are resistant to unblocking under storage conditions and in the absence of oxidized developer, but are unblocked upon release from the coupler during the coupling reaction. The intramolecular reaction which results in release of the LIG moiety can be an elimination reaction such as occurs with EMI14.1 wherein COUP is any suitable coupler moiety. This concept is described in U.S. Patent 4,409,323. Alternatively, the intramolecular release can occur by a nucleophilic displacement reaction, as occurs withEMI14.2 This concept is described in U.S. Patents 4,248,962 and 4,310,612. In yet another embodiment, LIG and X are connected with a single bond or with an organic linking moiety which generally remains with LIG when it is cleaved and is protonated or ionized depending upon the pKa of the group. Useful organic linking moieties include COO , CONH , O , S , SO2 , S02NH , CH2CO , S0 N Alkyl and the like as well as the timing groups described in U.S.Patent 4,248,962. A particularly useful linking group is a single bond or O . Examples useful in the practice of this embodiment of the invention as X moieties are the following color coupler moieties EMI15.1 wherein q is an integer of 1 to 20,EMI16.1 wherein R7 is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl preferably of 1 to 20 carbon atoms or substituted or unsubstituted aryl preferably of 6 to 14 carbon atoms ,EMI16.2 In these formulae, BALL is any suitable ballast group as described above e.g. NHSO 2C1 6H3 3, NHC0 alkylene oxy aryl, alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 14 carbon atoms in the nucleus, etc. , and LINK is a suitable linking moiety, as described above, which links X andLIG prior to reaction with oxidized developing agent. BALL can also be a suitable polymer backbone. Representative LIG X compounds useful in the practice of this invention include the following N f f4 chloro 3 4,4 dimethyl 3 oxo 2 4 2,2 6 ,2 terpyridyl oxy pentanamido 1 phenyl hexadecanesuIfonamide, a magenta dye providing compound, 1 hydroxy N 4 2,4 di t pentylphenoxy butyl 4 4 2,2 6 ,2 terpyridyl oxy 2 naphthamide, a magenta dye providing compound, 4 4,4 dimethyl 3 oxo 2 3 4 2,2 6 ,2 terpyridyl phenoxy pentanamido N methyl N octadecylbenzenesulfonamide, a magenta dye providing compound, l hydroxy 4 iII4 nitro 2 i N sopropyl N 6 phenyl 3 2 pyridyl 1,2,4 triazin 5 yl phenoxy carbonyl aminomethyl phenoxy N 2 tetra decyloxyphenyl 2 naphthamide, a magenta dye providing compound, and 1 hydroxy N 4 2,4 di t pentylphenoxy butyl 4 4 N 2 4 2,2 6 ,2 terpyridyl oxy ethyl sulfamoyl phenoxy 2 naphthamide, a magenta dye providing compound. The LIG X compounds useful in the practice of this invention can be readily prepared using chemical reactions known to one skilled in photographic chemistry. Generally, a compound from which the LIG moiety is derived is reacted with a compound e.g. a color coupler from which X can be derived. Detailed syntheses of exemplary LIG X compounds are provided below. In certain embodiments, the following general preparatory techniques can be used a Reaction of a LIG moiety containing a hydroxy group with a color coupler containing a leaving group e.g. halogen, tosylate, mesylate, sulfonium salt, etc. in the coupling off position to produce a LIG X compound of the invention having theLIG moiety bonded to the X coupler moiety through an 0 linkage. Alternatively, a LIG moiety having a mercapto group could be used to obtain a LIG X compound having the LIG and X moieties linked through an S linkage. b Reaction of a color coupler having a hydroxy group with a LIG moiety containing a leaving group as defined above to produce the same kind ofLIG X compound as described in a . In other embodiments, LIG X compounds useful in this invention can be prepared by condensation of a LIG containing carboxylic acid halide or sulfonic acid halide with a color coupler containing a hydroxy, mercapto or amino group in the coupling position to produce LIG X compounds having LIG and X moieties joined by an ester, amide, sulfonamide or thioester linkage. The LIG X compounds preferred for use in this invention can be prepared, in general, by the reaction of a ballasted and optionally solubilizedLIG moiety with a coupler moiety containing a leaving group in the coupling off position. This results in quaternization of LIG by the coupler to form LIG X where the chelation site of LIG is blocked.Alternatively, the LIG moiety can contain an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomer group such as acrylamide, acrylate, etc. . The LIG X compound resulting from reaction with a coupler moiety can be polymerized to yield a polymeric LIG X compound. As noted above, LIG is a moiety capable of complexing with metal ions to provide desired dyes in one or more layers of photographic elements. A variety of metal ions can be so used as long as the complex of the LIG moiety with the metal ion is stable, or in other words, the complex is likely to remain in complexed form for a substantial period of time. In general, the log of the formation constant of such complexes should be in the range of from 10 to 30, and preferably from 15 to 25. Useful metal ions include Fe , Co , Cu , Curt, and Os Ferrous ions are preferred in the practice of this invention. In the practice of this invention, cleavage of LIG from X results from reaction of oxidized developing agent with the LIG X compound. Any suitable developing agent can be used in the practice of this invention, which when oxidized from silver halide development, can react with LIG X.Particularly useful developing agents are color developing agents, including aminophenols, phenylenediamines, tetrahydroquinolines and the like as described, for example, in Research Disclosure, publication 17643, paragraph XX, noted above. Other useful developing agents include hydroquinones, catechols and pyrazolidones. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a negative image can be generated in an element. This is done by incorporating in the element a LIG X compound wherein X is a moiety which yields a colorless or diffusible reaction product with oxidized developer, and X is attached to LIG in such a manner that it is incapable of complexation with metal ions prior to the reaction with oxidized developer. LIG is appropriately ballasted as outlined above to prevent diffusion. Upon imagewise development with a developing agent, the LIG X bond is cleaved in exposed areas, and the coupled product may be washed out of the element if desired.Subsequent treatment of the element with metal ions e.g. ferrous ions either during the bleach step or in a separate metallization step provides dyes in the exposed areas, resulting in a negative image. In another embodiment of this invention, LIG and X are joined such that LIG is capable of complexing with metal ions without cleavage of theLIG X bond. In other words, the metal chelating site in LIG is not blocked by X. In the exposed areas of the element, a suitable color dye image is formed with a known color coupler and the LIG X bond is cleaved as a function of silver halide development to yield a soluble ligand which diffuses out of the element during processing so that it is unavailable to form a metal complex dye. The reaction product ofX and the oxidized developing agent can be colorless or diffusable, in which case it will not contribute to image density, or colored in which case it can augment or modify the principal dye image e.g. in color correction .In the unexposed areas, the unreacted LIG X compound is treated with metal ions e.g. ferrous ions to provide a visually colored dye which acts as a masking dye in those areas. The present invention can also be used to generate a reversal image in an element using what are known in the art as universal couplers. This can be done by incorporating a LIG X compound in the element wherein X is a moiety which yields a colorless or diffusible reaction product with oxidized developing agent and LIG is a moiety capable of complexing with metal ions to provide a dye while still linked to X. Upon imagewise development with a developing agent, the LIG X bond in exposed areas is cleaved and fragments washed out of the element.Subsequent treatment of the element with metal ions e.g. ferrous provides dyes in unexposed areas to provide a reversal image. In still another embodiment, the photographic element of this invention can provide a diffusion transfer image. This element comprises a support and a plurality of layers including one or more image recording layers and an image receiving layer. A LIG X compound is incorporated in or adjacent an image recording layer, and the LIG X bond is cleaved as a function of development either via coupling off chemistry or redox release chemistry.Redox release chemistry is described, e.g. in U.S.Patents 4,108,850 and 4,139,379, whereupon reduction of a hydroquinone compound releases a dye fragment.In either case, the released LIG moiety diffuses to the image receiving layer which contains mordanted metal ions. These ions complex with the LIG moiety to provide the desired dye image. The photographic elements and film units of this invention can be processed by known techniques in which the processing solutions or compositions are incorporated in the element or film unit or are separately applied in a solution or process sheet.These solutions or compositions contain developing agents e.g. color developing agents and other suitable processing addenda, as well as metal ions to complex with LIG, if desired. Alternatively, the metal ions can be incorporated within the element in the same or different layer as the LIG X compound.More specifically, processing of the elements of this invention can be accomplished by suitable silver development, either color or black and white, for example, by treatment with a phenylenediamine or hydroquinone developer, followed by bleaching with an Fe 3 salt bleach, or simply by treatment of the imagewise distribution of LIG with ferrous ions.Electron transfer agents can be used in redox release processes. The ferrous or other ions can be included in the bleach solution for complexation with the LIG moiety. Photographic elements of this invention in which the described LIG X compounds are incorporated can comprise a support and one or more silver halide emulsion layers and associated dye forming layers.The LIG X compounds can be incorporated in the silver halide emulsion layer or in another layer, such as an adjacent layer, where they will come into reactive association with oxidized color developing agent which has developed silver halide in the emulsion layer. The silver halide emulsion layer can contain, or have associated with it, photographic coupler compounds, such as color forming couplers, colored masking couplers, etc. These coupler compounds can form dyes of the same or different color or hue as the dyes formed by complexation of LIG and metal ions. Additionally, the silver halide emulsion layer can contain other addenda generally contained in such layers. A multilayer, multicolor photographic element of this invention can comprise a support having thereon a red sensitive silver halide emulsion unit having associated therewith a cyan dye image providing material, a green sensitive silver halide emulsion unit having associated therewith a magenta dye image providing material and a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion unit having associated therewith a yellow dye image providing material, at least one of the silver halide emulsion units having associated therewith a LIG X compound. Each silver halide emulsion unit can be composed of one or more layers and the various units and layers can be arranged in different locations with respect to one another as is known in the art. The LIG X compounds described herein can be incorporated into or associated with one or more units or layers of the element.Preferably, the LIG X compound is in or associated with the green sensitive silver halide emulsion unit. The light sensitive silver halide emulsions can include coarse, regular or fine grain silver halide crystals or mixtures thereof and can be comprised of such silver halides as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver chlorobromoiodide and mixtures thereof. The emulsions can be negative working or direct positive emulsions. They can form latent images predominantly on the surface of the silver halide grains or predominantly on the interior of the grains. They can be chemically and spectrally sensitized. The emulsions generally are gelatin containing emulsions although other natural or synthetic hydrophilic colloids, soluble polymers or mixtures thereof can be used if desired. The element support can be any suitable substrate used in photographic elements. Generally, a flexible paper or resinous film support is used, and a paper support is particularly useful. Paper supports can be acetylated or coated with baryta and or an a olefin polymer such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene butene copolymer and the like. Further details regarding silver halide emulsions and photographic elements, including diffusion transfer elements, are well known in the art as described, for example, in ResearchDisclosure, publication 17643, noted above, as well as in Research Disclosure, publication 15162,November, 1976 and U. S. Patent 4,358,525. Preparation 1 A useful magenta dye forming LIG X compound is 1 hydroxy N 4 2,4 di t pentylphenoxy butyl 4 4 2,2 6 ,2 terpyridyl oxy 2 naphthamide which was prepared in the following manner. To a solution of 12.25 g 25 mmole of 1,4 dihydroxy N 4 2,4 di t pentylphenoxy butyl 2 naphthamide and 3.1 g 10 mmole of 2,6 di 2 pyridyl 4 methylsulfonopyridine in 100 ml of dryN,N dimethylformamide DMF under N 2 was added in portions 2.4 g 50 mmole of 50 NaH. After hydrogen evolution was complete, the solution was heated to 90 C for two hours. Thin layer chromatography analysis 9 1 CH3CN MeOH revealed that all of the sulfone was consumed. The reaction mixture was poured into 2 1 of dilute KH2PO buffer, and the product solidified upon stirring. After removal of the solvent, the crude product was triturated several times with cyclohexane to remote unreacted naphthamide.The resulting purified L G X compound was isolated by filtration as r. tan solid 9 g .Analysis by mass spectroscopy showed the compound to be consistent with the assigned structure. Preparation 2 The monomer l benzoylmethyl 4 2 acrylamidoethoxy 6 2,2 bipyridyl pyridinium bromide was prepared in the fcllowing manner. A mixture of 10.00 g 20 mmole of N 2 2,6 di 2 pyridyl 4 pyridyloxy ethyl acrylamide and 5.79 g 29 mmole of alpha bromoacetophenone in 10.0 ml DMF was stirred at 800C under argon for 3.5 hours. Upon cooling to room temperature, the resulting solid mass was triturated ith CH2Cl2 to remove unreacted starting materials. The crude product was fiLtered, washed with CH2C12 and taken up in methanol. The methanol solution was evaporated in vacuo to a clear oil. Addition of CH2C12 followed by trituration yielded 6 g of a white solid.

The coating levels were 1.8 g m2 of magenta dye providing LIG X compound, 5.9 g m2 of the yellow dye providing color coupler, 2.5 g m2 of Ag and 12.4 g m2 of gelatin. The resulting element was imagewise exposed, developed and bleached as described in Example 2 to provide a cyan dye image. Uncoupled LIG moiety was washed out of the exposed areas. The element was then treated with ferrous ions as in Example 2. The ferrous ions complexed with the LIG moiety of the uncoupled LIG X compound, generating a magenta color correcting dye in the unexposed areas of the element.
