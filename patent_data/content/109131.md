# Method of and device for the continuous manufacture of elongate bodies starting from unmolten solid starting material.

## Abstract
A method of and a device for the continuous melting in particular of glass 11 by means of a high frequency electro magnetic field in a melting tube 1 in which the field is coupled in the melt 11 by means of a coil 5 which is present within the cooling jacket 5 surrounding the melting tube 1 . An earthed screen 6 and a tube 13 of insulating material are present between the wall of the melting tube 1 and the coil 5 . The melt traverses 11 a heating zone and a refining zone and a solid elongate body is withdrawn from the bottom of the tube 1 .
