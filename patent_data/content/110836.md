## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a moaular solar panel structure,erfective to be applied on roof coverings. As it is well known, there are increasingly ueedl solar panels in civil applications, generally for water heating purposes, for home applications. The mentioned solar panels are usually formed Dy a pair or plate like members,couled to one another ana jointly deriving a path ror the passing there thorugh of a thermal exchange fluid. Those same panels, in order to exploit in a maximum degree the impinging solar energy, are mountea an a hiBh ana well exposea position ana, in civil apploations, they are generally mounted on the roor covering. The presently commercially available known solar panels, are however affected by great drawbacks concerning the installation thereoz,since they require to this ena several special tools. Moreover, because or the high cost ana the constructional complexity of the known solar panels, the surfaces which may be equipped with said panels are rather small and,accordingly, the power which mayDe recoverea is also very reduced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove cited drawbacks by providing a solar panel structure which does not present any installation problems,as well as intercoupling problems to other like structures. Within the scope of the above task, it is a primary object or the present invention to provide a solar panel structure which may be easily and economically applied on existing roofs, provided with any covering types, even of the tile construction. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a solar panel structure having a curved shape which is effective to pick up the solar rays with a great efficiency,from dawn to the sunset. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide sucn a solar panel structure which has small size, in such a way as not to be affected,even at hign temperatures,by great eepansions of the component parts thereof. Yet another object or the present invention is to provide such a solar panel structure which,owing to its reduced size and weight, is not affected in any substantial ways by the wind. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a solar panel. structure which is effective to preserve the aesthetic aspect of the rool thereon it will, be mounted, thereby preserving the aesthetical aspect or the overall buiding. According to one aspect of the present invention, the thereinabove task and objects,as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter,are achieved by a modular solar panel structure, characterized in that it comprises a cup member made of glass or any suitable transparent material, having a substantially semicylindrical shape,in the inside of kEich there is provided a metal material coil, provided, at the ends thereof, with suitable length portions which are 900 bent with respect to the axis of said coil, in such a way as to project, for a given length,from said cup,througn the underlying roof covering layer. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Purther characteristics and advantages of the solar panel structure according to the present invention will become more apparent hereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrateo,by way of an indicative but not limitative example,in the accompanying drawings, where fig.l is a perspective view illustrating the solar panel structure according to the present invention fig. 2 is a longitudinal cross section OÃŽ tat same structure,as mounted on a generic supporting structure rig.3 is a perspective view illustrating te subject solar panel structure as applied on a tile or the so callea Portoguese type fig.4 is a cross section of that tile,provided with the solar panel structure according to the present invention fig.5 illustrates a roof portion the covering whereof consists or a plurality of the mentioned equipped tiles anu fig.6 illustrates a partial cross section or a root, to the tiles whereof has been applieu the subject solar panel structure. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to the numbers references of the several Figures or the accompanying drawings, the modular solar panel structure according to the present invention comprises a cup member l,made or glass or any other suitable transparent material enclosing a metal coil 2,preferably a copper coil. Ihe montioned cup member has a substantially semicylindrical shape defined, at the two ends thereof, by corresponding walls 3 provided,at the bottom thereof, with a perimetrical line 4 effective to mate the profile 5 or the covering elements 6, thereon the structure is to be applied. Moreover, the edge or that same cup member 1 is provided, along the overall extension thereof, with a tightness gasket 20. The mentioned metal coil,in particular,is provided,at the ends thereof, with a downwardly directed small pipe 7,having a sufficient length t Protruae, for a given portion, from said covering element thickness. In actual practice,after having formed,at suitable positions, through holes 8 in said covering elements, into two or said holes there are inserted said small pipes 7. The remaining holes ts are effective, jointly to corresponding holes,as formed in the cup member, to affix the latter, by means of small bolts 9,to the corresponding roof covering element. The mentioned small pipes 7 substantially extend under the roof structure 10 thereby allowing ror the possibility or series or parralel coupling a plurality or coil 2, by using flexible silicone tubular members 11,which are pressure fitted on the ends of said small pipes 7. Moreover, said coils 2 may be coupled, by those same means, two an outlet manifola 12 and an inlet manifold 13, communicating with a collecting tank, preferably consisting of a heat exchanger 14, thereinto system water is introduced from the duct 15 and therefrom heated water is taken through the duct 16. Moreover it is provided that, on the system communicating to one another the mentionea outlet and inlet ducts, be mounted an expansion tank 17 and a motor 18, controlled by a thermostat,for circulating the diathermal fluid. Advantageously, the coil 2 may be located on a supporting plate 19,suitably blackened,effective to favour the absorption or solar energy, to be successively transmitted to said coil. It should moreover be pointed out that the tus constructed solar panel structure may be preliminarily located,in a plurali of samples, or units, coupled to one another, on a generic supporting structure effective to be applied on any smooth roofs, even of the tile type. Prom the above disclosure and the observavion or the several figures of the accompanying drawings the great functionality and use facility characteriz ing the modular solar panel structure according to the present invention will be self evident.
