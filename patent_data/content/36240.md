# Selective contact crimper.

## Abstract
A pair of feeder bowls 12,14 are placed one above the other to simultaneously feed two different types of wire con tacts 16, 18 onto two different tracks, and into separate alignment openings 34, 36 in a guide block. A pivotally mounted crimper 76 is selectively moved to position the crimper head 82 over the selected alignment opening. A rod 60 extending from the crimper automatically positions a selector bar 70 to actuate a plunger rod 42, 46 to move the selected contact into position to be crimped.
