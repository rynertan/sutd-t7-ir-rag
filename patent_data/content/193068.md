## Description
ONE LIQUID TYPE EPOXY RESIN COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a one liquid type epoxy resinComposition. More particularly, it relates to a one liquid type epoxy resin composition which can be curea at a lower temperature and also has excellent storage stability.Epoxy resins have been used in a variety of fields such as adhesives, paints, laminating and casting, on account of the excellent properties inherent in the cured products thereof. Epoxy resin compositions which nowadays are generally used are so called two liquid type compositions comprising an epoxy resin and a curing agent which are mixed just before use. Although the two liquid type epoxy resin compositions can be cured at room temperature, their preservation and handling are troublesome because the epoxy resin and the curing agent must be preserved separately and both must be weighed in desired amounts and mixed before use.Moreover, since the time during which they remain in a usable state is limited, they cannot be mixed in advance in a large amount and, when they are used in a large amount, mixing must be repeated frequently, thereby inevitably causing a loss of efficiency.For the purpose of eliminating the disadvantages associated with two liquid type epoxy resin compositions, there have been proposed several kinds of one liquid type epoxy resin compositions. Examples are compositions incorporating with an epoxy resin a latent curing agent such as dicyandiamide, a BF3 amine complex and an amine salt compositions obtained by mixing an epoxy resin and an amine type curing agent and immediately freezing the mixture to stop the reaction between the resin and the curing agent compositions in which an amine type curing agent is formed into microcapsules dispersed in an epoxy resin e.g. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.83023 1983 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 43176 1986 compositions in which a curing agent is adsorbed in a molecular sieve to prevent the curing agent from coming into contact with the epoxy resin etc.However, these compositions which use freezing, microencapsulation, molecular sieves, etc. may have extremely high production costs in the present technical state of the art. Furthermore, they can not be said to give satisfactory performances.For instance, in Japanese Patent Publication No.17654 1968, a curing agent is formed into microcapsules to provide a one liquid type composition. However, when an epoxy resin is cured with this curing agent, the microcapsules must be destroyed by the application of mechanical force. Accordingly, such a composition is not suitable under the presently required curing conditions of 100 to 150 C in 10 to 60 minutes without the application of pressure. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 83023 1983, a functional group present on the surface of the particles of a curing agent which functional group reacts with an epoxy resin is blocked with methyl iodide, acetic acid, etc.However, such a mere blockage of the surface functional group cannot achieve the performance, in particular with respect to storage stability, of a one liquid type composition.Aiso in the examples where a latent curing agent is used, those having excellent storage stability must be cured at high temperature, whereas those capable of being cured at relatively lower temperature are inferior in storage stability. Thus, in practice, the compositions containing a latent curing agent are not satisfactory.Even though they are not entirely satisfactory, a variety of one liquid type epoxy resin type compositions containing a latent curing agent are used in view of the easy handling of the curing agent and the inexpensiveness of the products. However, as mentioned above, the compositions which have excellent storage stability may have inferior curability, and various improvements have been attempted. Dicyandiamide, which is a well known latent curing agents requires a curing temperature of 170 C or more when it is cured by itself. Its storage stability is 6 months or more at room temperature. In order to lower the curing temperature of dicyandiamide, it has been proposed to add an accelerator such as a tertiary amine, an imidazole, or a dimethylurea compound.The addition of the accelerator lowers the curing temperature, but decreases the storage stability, thus not making the most of the latent properties of the dicyandiamide. Accordingly, there has been a strong need for a one liquid type epoxy resin composition containing an accelerator capable of lowering the curing temperature without impairing characteristics such as excellent storage stability possessed by a latent curing agent like dicyandiamide. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present inventors have made intensive studies to develop an epoxy resin composition which can overcome the disadvantages possessed by conventional one liquid type epoxy resin compositions, and yet can retain the advantages inherent in the one liquid type composition.This invention has been thus accomplished.Namely, this invention concerns a one liquid type epoxy resin composition which comprises s tl an epoxy resin A and 2 a curing agent B consisting essentially of a powdery amine compound C having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 C, the particles of said powdery amine compound being coated with at lease one of the following layers i a layer formed by adhesion to ehe surface of said articles of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate D , a carboxylic acid E , a carboxylic acid anhydride F , an acid halogenated compound G and an epoxy compound H and ii a layer formed by covalent bonding of the powdery amine compound C with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate D t a carboxylic acid E , a carboxylic acid anhydride F , an acid halogenated compound G and an epoxy compound H the softening temperature of said curing agent B being 5 to 50 C higher than the softening temperature of said powdery amine compound C . This invention also concerns a one liquid type epoxy resin composition which comprises 1 an epoxy resin A 2 a curing agent B comprising a powdery amine compound C having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 C, the particles of said powdery amine compound being coated with at least one of the following layers i a layer formed by adhesion to the surface of said particles of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate D , a carboxylic acid E , a carboxylic acid anhydride F , an acid halogenated compound G and an epoxy compound H and ii a layer formed by covalent bonding of the powdery amine compound C with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate D , a carboxylic acid E , a carboxylic acid anhydride F , an acid halogenated compound G and an epoxy compound H the softening temperature of said curing agent B being 5 to 50 OC higher than the softening temperature of said powdery amine compound C and 3 at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a guanidine 0 , an aromatic amine P , a carboxylic acid anhydride Q and a hydrazide R .The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this invention has excellent storage stability and curability as compared with conventional one liquid type epoxy resin compositions. Further, variances in products due to production conditions can be significantly reduced with the one liquid type epoxy resin composition of this intention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe one liquid type epoxy resin composition of this invention will be described below in greater detail.The epoxy resin A used in this invention is not particularly limited as long as it has two or more epoxy groups in one molecule on an average. For example, the epoxy resin may be prepared from polyhydric phenols such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, catechol and resorcinol polyglycidyl ethers obtained by reacting polyhydric alcohols such as glycerine and polyethylene glycol with epichlorohydrin esters of glycidyl ether obtained by reacting hydroxycarboxylic acids such as p oxybenzoic acid and p oxynaphthoic acid with epichlorohydrin polyglycidyl esters obtained by reacting polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid and terephthalic acid with epichlorohydrin glycidyl amine compounds obtained by reacting 4, 4 diaminodiphenyl methane, m aminophenol, etc. with epichlorohydrin epoxydized novolac resins epoxydized cresol novolac resins epoxydized polyolefins, etc.The epoxy resin A is not limited to the above examples.A preferable epoxy resin contains a glycidyl ether of bisphenol A. The hydrolyzable chlorine contained in the epoxy resin greatly affects the storage stability and the curability of the product. Accordingly, the content of hydrolyzable chlorine preferably should not exceed 300 ppm, and more preferably, should not exceed 50 ppm.The powdery amine compound C used in this invention and having a softening temperature of 50 to 15Q OC may be obtained by grinding an amine compound C having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 OC, If the softening temperature is less than 50 C, the powdery amine compound C tends to coagulate during storage, making handling of the product difficult. If it is more than 150 C, the goal of curing in a shorter time is not met.In order to obtain a product which cures very easily and has excellent storage stability, the preferable softening temperature is the range of from 60 to 120 OC. In this invention, the softening temperature refers to the temperature at which the substance starts to melt, and is measured according to JIS K0064 Method of Measuring Melting Points of Chemical Products .The powdery amine compound C used in this invention and having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 OC may be a single compound.

The softening temperature of the powdery amine compound C may be controlled by controlling the amounts of epoxy resin curing agent X and of compound Y . The powdery amine compound C may be selected from those amines having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 OC, but it is preferably a compound I having two or more amino group active hydrogens per molecule of the powdery amine compound C , or having one or more tertiary amino groups per molecule of the powdery amine compound C . The compound having the amino group active hydrogens may be, for example, the above mentioned aromatic amine compounds having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 OC adducts of aliphatic amines with an epoxy resin such as an adduct of ethylenediamine with an epoxy resin, an adduct of diethylenetriamine with an epoxy resin, an adduct of triethylenetetramine with an epoxy resin, an adduct of hexamethylenediamine with an epoxy resin and an adduct of diethylaminopropylamine with an epoxy resin condensates of aliphatic amines with dicarboxylic acids polyureas such as an adduct of an aliphatic amine with toluylene diisocyanate and an adduct of an aliphatic amine with hexamethylenediisocyanate and denatured products of succinic hydrazide, adipic hydrazide, dicyandiamide, etc.The compound having one or more tertiary amino groups may be, for example, the above mentioned imidazole compounds having a softening temperature of 50 to 150 OC adducts of imidazole compounds with epoxy resins adducts of carboxylates of imidazole compounds with epoxy resins and adducts of compounds having secondary amino groups with an epoxy resins such as an adduct of dimethylamine with an epoxy resin, an adduct of dipropylamine with an epoxy resin, an adduct of di hydroxymethyl amine with an epoxy resin and an adduct of di hydroxyethyl amine with an epoxy resin.Compound I may b produced by commonly known synthesis methods.

The carboxylic acid may be acetic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, adipic acid, phthalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, trimellitic acid, etc.Also, the compound K having one or more epoxy groups per molecule may be a monoepoxy compound such as butylglycidyl ether, hexylglycidyl ether, phenylglycidyl ether, p xylylglycidyl ether, glycidyl acetate, glycidyl butyrate, glycidyl hexoate, glycidyl benzoate, etc,, or the compound K may be any of the above mentioned respective components for the epoxy resin A . For obtaining excellent curability and storage stability, preferable is a compound or a mixture of compounds selected from 2 methylimidazole and 2 ethyl4 methylimidazole as the imidazole compound L , and most preferable as the epoxy compound K is an epoxy resin obtained by reacting bisphenol A with epichlorohydrin.The adduct N of the imidazole compound L with the epoxy compound K may be produced by commonly known methods The softening temperature of the adduct N may be controlled by controlling the amounts of the imidazole compound L and the epoxy compound K .The mean particle size of the powdery amine compound C used in this invention is not particularly limited.Sometimes, however, the curing rate may be reduced and the properties of the cured product impaired when the mean particle size is too large. Preferably, the mean particle size should not exceed 50 p. A mean particle size exceeding this value may result in lowering of chemical resistance and mechanical strength in the cured product. Most preferably, the mean particle size should not exceed 5The mean particle size refers to the Stokers diameter measured by a centrifugal sedimentation method or a sedimentation method shown in Table 4.4 in CoagulationEngineering published in 1982 by the Japan PowderIndustry Technolgy Association. The mean particle size refers also to a mode diameter.The shape of the particles of the powdery amine compound C used in this invention is not particularly limitedHowever, for readiness in curing, the particles should have a non spherical shape. Non spherical particles may be obtained by mechanical grinding. For example, a hammer mill grinding machine, a jet grinding machine, a ball mill grinding machine, etc. may be used. Non spherical shape in this invention means a shape having more than one values in the spherical degree shown in Table 13 3 in the Handbook of Chemical Industries ,Chemical Industry Association, Revised 4th Edition,January 20, 1984, 4th Print.The isocyanate compound D used in this invention may be phenyl isocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and xylylene diisocyanate, etc.The carboxylic acid compound E may be an formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, etc.The acid halogenated compound G may be an acid halide such as acetyl chloride, a chloride of propionic acid, a chloride of succinic acid, a chloride of adipic acid, etc.The carboxylic acid anhydride compound F may be pyromellitic anhydride, benzophenone tetracarboxylpç anhydride, acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, etc.The epoxy compound H may be the above mentioned compound K having one or more of epoxy groups p molecule, or the above mentioned amine compound CE, tc.The preferable compound for coating the particles of epoxy resin A is an isocyanate D . Particularly preferable is a compound or a mixture of compounds selected from toluylene diisocyanate and 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, whereby a product having very excellent storage stability and curability can be obtained.In this invention, the method of coating the powdery amine compound C with the layer formed by adhesion and or by covalent bonding may be, for example, a method in which the powdery amine compound C is homogeneously dispersed preferably with stirring in a solvent which does not dissolve it, followed by addition of the isocyanate D , etc., or a method in which the powdery amine compound C is fluidized in a stream, followed by spraying of the isocyanate D , etc.In this invention, it is very important that the softening temperature of the curing agent B is 5 to 50 OC higher than the softening temperature of the powdery amine compound C , in order for good storage stability and curability to be obtained. If the softening temperature of the curing agent B is less than 5 OC higher than the softening temperature of the powdery amine compound C , no improvement in storage stability is achieved, thus making the product unsuitable for use in the summer, although there would be no remarkable difference between curability of the curing agent B and the curability of the powdery amine compound C . If the difference in softening points between the curing agent B and the powdery amine compound C exceeds 50 C, the curability of the curing agent B becomes extremely poor as compared with that of the powdery amine compound C , although the storage stability of the curing agent B becomes very good. The difference in the softening temperatures may be controlled by selecting the kind of the powdery amine compound C or adjusting the kind or the amount of the powdery amine compound C , the isocyanate D , the carboxylic acid E , the carboxylic acid anhydride F , the acid halogenated compound G and the epoxy compound H . Particularly preferably, the difference in softening temperatures should be 10 to 40 OC for best curability and storage stability.The average thickness of the coating layer formed by adhesion or covalent bonding to the surface of the particles of amine compound C is chosen from the viewpoint of the curability and storage stability, and is preferably in the range of 100 to 10,000 . If it is less than 100 A, the storage stability will not be improved, and if it is more than 10,000 A, the curability will become extremely inferior as compared with that of the powdery amine compound C . The thickness of layer herein mentioned may be determined by observing a sliced curing agent B by use of a transmission type electron microscope. Particularly preferably, the average thickness should be in the range of 200 to 1,000 A for best curability and storage stability.In this invention, the difference in softening temperature between the powdery amine compound C and the curing agent B is due to the apparent rise in softening temperature caused by formation of the coating layer by adhesion or covalent bonding to the powdery amine compound C .In this invention, it is not possible to distinguish the coating layer formed by adhesion from the coating layer formed by covalent bonding to the surface of the powdery amine compound C .The guanidine compound 0 used in this invention may be, for example, dicyandiamide, methyl guanidine, ethyl guanidine, propyl guanidine, butyl guanidine, dimethyl guanidine, trimethyl guanidine, phenyl guanidine, diphenyl guanidine, toluyl guanidine, etc. The aromatic amine P may be, for example, diaminodiphenylmethane, diamiflodiphenylsulfone, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, diaminotoluene, diaminoxylene, diaminodiphenylamine, diaminobiphenyl, bis 3 çhloro 4 aminophenyl methane, diaminobenzoic acid, etc.The carboxylic.acid.anhydride Q may be, for example1 phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, 3 chlorphthalic anhydride, 4 chlorophthalic anhydride, benzophenonetetracarboxyl ic anhydride, succinic anhydride, methylsuccinic anhydride, dimethylsuccinic anhydride, dichlorosuccinic anhydride, nadic methyl anhydride, succinic dodecyl anhydride, chlorendic anhydride, maleic anhydride, etc. The hydrazide R may be, for example, succinic hydrazide, adipic hydrazide1 glutaric hydrazide, sebacic hydrazide, phthalic hydrazide, isophthalic hydrazide, terephthalic hydrazide, p oxybenzoic hydrazide, salicylic hydrazide, tphenylaminopropionic hydrazide, maleic hydrazide, and the like. The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this invention is obtained by merely mixing the epoxy resin A and the curing agent B homogeneously. The mixing ratio is selected in view of both the curability and the properties of the cured product, and is preferably 0.1. part to 50 parts by weight of the curing agent B to 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin A . If the amount of curing agent B is less than 0.1 part by weight, a very long period of time is required to obtain sufficient curing, thus making the a product unsuitable for practical use. Also, if the amount of curing agent B exceeds 50 parts by weight, the viscosity of the mixture becomes high, thus increasing heat generation during the course of curing, thereby making it too difficult to control the curing to obtain a cured product.The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this invention can also be obtained by merely mixing homogeneously the epoxy resin A , the curing agent B , and component 3 selected from the group consisting of a guanidine, an aromatic amine, a carboxylic acid anhydride and a hydrazide. The mixing ratio is selected in view of the curability and the properties of the cured product, and is preferably 5 to 80 parts by weight of component 3 and 0.1 part to 20 parts by weight of the curing agent B to 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin A .If the amount of component 3 and the amount of the curing agent B are less than 5 parts by weight and 0.1 part by weight, respectively, a very long period of time is required to obtain sufficient curing, thus making the product unsuitable for practical use. Also, if the amount of.component 3 and the amount of the curing agent B exceed 80 parts by weight and 20 parts by weight, respectively, the viscosity of a mixture becomes high, making the composition difficult to handle.The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this invention may be used optionally in combination with other curing agents. They may be, for example, phenol resins, melamine resins, urea resins, etc.The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this invention may be mixed optionally with an extending agent, a reinforcing agent, a filler, a pigment, etc.They may be, for example, coal tar, glass fiber, asbçstos fiber, boron fiber, carbon fiber, cellulose, polyethylene powder, polypropylene powder, quartz powder, mineral silicate, mica, asbestos powder, slate powder, kaolin, aluminum oxide trihydrate, aluminum hydroxide, chalk powder, gypsum, calcium carbonate, antimony trioxide, pentone, silica, aerosol, lithophone, baryte titanium dioxide, carbon black, graphite, iron oxide, gold, aluminum powder, iron powder, etc. These optionaL components may be selected according to the end use of the. composition.The one liquid type epoxy resin omposition of this invention may be mixed optionally with an organic solvent, a reactive diluent, a non reactive diluent, a denatured epoxy resin , etc. The organic solvent may be, for example, toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, etc. The reactive diluent may be, for example, butyl glycidyl ether, N.N diglycidyl o toluidine, phenyl glycidyl ether, styrene oxide, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether, 1,6 hexanediol diglycidyl ether, etc. The non reactive diluent may be, for example, dioctyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl adipate, petroleum solvents, etc. The modified epoxy resin may be, for example, a urethane modified epoxy resin, a rubber modified epoxy resin, an alkyd modified epoxy resin, etc. The one liquid type epoxy resin composition of this invention , has excellent storage stability at room temperature, has remarkably improved durability as compared with conventional one liquid type epoxy resin compositions, and can provide a cured product having good performance.The one liquid type epoxy resin composition according to this inventipn, giving an excellent cured product, can be utilized in a variety of fields.
