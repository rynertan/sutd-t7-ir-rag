## Description
RETROREFLECTIVE SLEETING Retroreflective sheeting has particular use in making highway signs, street signs and the like, and is now employed extensively. The Federal government has recognized two primary types of retroreflective sheeting glass bead and cubecorner. Such approved sheeting materials are found in a specification entitled FP79 , published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal HighwayAdministration. Specification FP 79 presently has been adopted as a purchasing standard by many state highway departments, and it sets forth certain minimum specifications which must be met by retroreflective sheeting of the cube corner type. Included among the specified characteristics are those for reflectivity, color, flexibility of material and resistance to cracking and weathering. Cube corner type reflector elements generally provide a higher specific intensity at 0.20 observation angle and Oe entrance angle than do glass bead type reflector elements, but, to applicants knowledge, no one successfully has furnished a sheeting material in commercial quantities which generally will meet the requirements for the Class IIIB sheeting set forth in the aforementioned PP 79 specification. It therefore is a primary object of the present invention to provide a unique sheeting product which will substantially meet such specified criteria and which can be produced in accordance with the novel methods disclosed herein in an economical fashion and in commercial quantities. Retroreflectivity is achieved by cube corner type reflector elements primarily through the principle of total internal reflection. It is well known that any surface contact made by another material with the faces of the cube corner elements generally has a deleterious effect on the reflectiveness of the reflector element. However, when all of the element faces are metallized, or mirrored, then, rather than relying upon total internal reflection, retroreflection is achieved by specular reflection from the mirrored faces. Generally, metallizing will provide a grayish or black coloration under certain daylight conditions vis avvis unmetallized cube corner type elements. The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for producing retroreflective sheeting constructions snd, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for producing a flexible laminate sheeting construction including an upper thermoplastic sheet, the reverse of which is provided with a repeating, retroreflecting pattern of fine or precise detail, a backcoating to protect the formed pattern, and a selectively applied intermediate layer allowing bonding of the backcoating to overlay the formed pattern on the thermoplastic sheet while preserving and enhancing the retroreflective properties of both the formed pattern and the laminated sheet. More precisely, the present invention is applicable to the production of cube corner type retroreflective sheeting laminates. Within the art of designing reflectors and retroreflective material, the terms cube corner or trihedral, or tetrahedral are recognized in the art as describing structure or patterns consisting of three mutually perpendicular faces, not limited to any particular size or shape of the faces, or the orientation of the optical axis of the cube corner element. Each of the cube corner faces can assume a different size and shape relative to the others, depending upon the angular reflective response characteristics desired, and the cube forming techniques employed. Examples of prior cube corner type reflectors may be found in U.S.Patent No. 1,906,655, issued to Stimson, and U.S. Patent No. 4,073,568, issued toHeasley. Stimson shows a reflex light reflector including an obverse face and a reverse light reflecting face consisting of a plurality of cube corner type reflector elements with each such element having three mutually perpendicular surfaces adapted for total internal reflection of light impinging thereon from the obverse face. Heasley describes a cube corner type reflector in the form of a rectangular parallelpiped. It long has been desired to obtain the benefits of cube corner reflective properties in the form of flexible sheeting. As noted above, one advantageous aspect of such sheeting is in the manufacture of highway and street signs, markers and the like, where graphics are printed, painted, silk screened or otherwise applied to a highly reflective substrate mounted to a flat, stiff, supportive surface.Flexible retroreflective sheeting, when used as such a substrate, can be stored and shipped while wound onto rolls, and can readily be cut or otherwise formed into the desired shape and size required for a particular application. The reflective nature of the sheeting allows such signs, markers, and the like to reflect light from a vehicle s headlights, permitting the item to be read by the driver, without requiring a permanent light source to illuminate the sign or marker. Production of such retroretlective sheeting has been made practicable by apparatus and methods to form precise cube corner patterns in greatly reduced sizes on flexible thermoplastic sheeting. Desirably, such sheeting may then be assembled in the form of self adhesive laminates. Others have recognized the desireability of producing retroreflective thermoplastic material in sheet form. United States Patents Nos. 2,310,790, 2,380,447, and 2,481,757, granted to Jungersen. describe and teach the shortcomings of previouslyknown reflectors manufactured from glass, and the advantages inherent in providing a reflective material in a less fragile and more flexible sheet form.While so suggesting, it is not known if Jungzersen in fact ever commercialized any product disclosed in such patents. In U.S. Patents Nos. 4,244,683 and 4,332,847 issued to Rowland the desirability of manufacturing cube corner retroreflective sheeting in a continuous, non stop process is presented, but the approach selected by Rowland is a semicontinuous process Rowland 683, column 2, lines 1838 , presumably so called because the process requires frequent repositioning of the molding plates. In United States Patent No. 3,187,068, issued to DeVries, et al.. continuous production of reflective sheeting is disclosed, utilizing encapsulated glass microspheres as the reflecting medium. DeVries. et al. describes the application of a pressure activated adhesive layer to such sheeting to enable attachment of sheeting segments to selected surfaces. In United States Patent No. 3,649,352, issued to CournevnW a beaded sheeting construction is described, portions of which become reflective when heated, and which includes a pressure activated adhesive layer allowing attachment of the sheeting construction to other articles. Palmquist, et al.. 2,407,680 teach the utilization of glass microspheres or beads included as the reflective elements in nexible sheet forms Tun , et al. inUnited States Patent No. 4,367,920, also describes a laminated sheet construction using glass microspheres as the reflective elements. A common problem in the construction of reflective laminate sheeting is to find means to bond the lamina firmly together in a way which preserves the required retroreflective qualities of the reflective elements selected for use. An example of prior efforts to solve this problem with respect to glass microsphucs may be seen in United States Patent No. 3,190,178, issued to McKenziet wherein a cover sheet or film is secured over exposed glass microspheres by use of die elements which force a portion of the material in which the glass microspheres are embedded into contact with the cover sheet. The die elements thus create a grid pattern on the resulting sheeting construction, with each grid forming a separate cell.Within each cell, an air space is maintained between the microspheres and the cover sheet, and incident light traverses the cover sheet and the air space to be retroreflected by the embedded microspheres. Holmen et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,924,929, teach a cube corner type upper rigid sheet having upstanding walls, or septa, integrally formed as part of the cube pattern. The septa extend to form a regular geometric pattern of individual cells, with the septa extending at least as far from the upper sheet as the cube corner elements. A particulate packing may be used to fill each of the cells, and a backing sheet is then attached to the rear of the upper sheet, with the septa serving as the attachment sites. Holmen, et al. use relatively large cube corner elements fashioned as rigid sections bound to a flexible back, and has limited flexibility in use. In McGrath, U.S. Patent No. 4,025,159, the cellular concept is described with respect to cube corner type retroreflective sheeting, through use of dies to force a carrier film into contact with the reverse side of the cube corner sheeting.The carrier film must then be cured with radiation to bind it to the cube corner sheeting and, as in McKenzie, the resulting cells include an airspace extending between the carrier film and the reverse side of the cube corner sheet. The air cell structure apparently was intended to provide a hermetically sealed cell, avoiding the need for metalizing the cube corner elements, and providing an airithermoplastie interface to enhance retroreflection. None of the foregoing teach the assembly of molded or embossed cubecorner type retroreflective sheeting into selfadhesive laminates which protect and enhance the reflective properties of the sheeting without requiring the use of dies or of integrally molded septa or walls included as part of the cube pattern.Further, none of the foregoing permits the material to benefit from encapsulated sections of cube corner elements while enhancing and substantially meeting the requirements specified in the aforementioned DOT FP 79 Specification. BRIEP DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION A thermoplastic sheet or web is provided on its reverse side with a retrorenective cube corner type pattern. A thin layer of a liquid vehicle or solvent containing hydrophobic granular material such as silica treated with silanes is deposited on the reverse side of the web, as by screen printing, in a pattern leaving selected sites devoid of granular material. The web is then dried to drive off the solvent and, thereafter, a water based backcoating is applied over the granular material pattern, with portions of the backcoating being in direct contact with the thermoplastic web at those sites on the web devoid of granular material.Thereafter, the backcoating is dried or cured, and a layer of adhesive such as pressuresensitive or heat activated adhesive is applied thereto. This procedure thus enables the assembly of patterned web material into laminates which include an activated adhesive layer while protecting the retroreflective properties of the precisely formed cube corner pattern. A thin layer of a hydrophobic silica mixture is then screened or sprayed onto the embossed reverse surface of the laminated thermoplastic web in a diamondlike pattern, and is thereafter dried. A water based backcoating mixture of certain formulation is next deposited over the silica layer to encapsulate the silica and to contact the thermoplastic sheet where no silica was deposited. The backcoating then is heat dried and or cured to form a continuous film. A pressuresensitive or heat activated adhesive then is applied to the cured backcoating layer, with the adhesive protected by a release sheet which is removed when the laminate is applied to an object. In a the preferred embodiment, an outer protective layer of thermoplastic material, used to provide additional weather resistant properties, is secured to the thermoplastic web on the side opposite from that upon which the retroreflective pattern is formed during or before the cube forming process.. The completed laminate is then cut, trimmed, or otherwise shaped for application to supporting surfaces, such as street or highway signs, and graphics or other indicia may thereafter be painted, printed, silk screened, or otherwise affixed to the uppermost surface of the laminate, thus producing a readily and easily constructed highly retroreflective finished product. These and further aspects of the present invention will become more apparent upon consideration of the accompanying drawings, wherein FIG. 1 is an enlarged perspective and somewhat schematic view of one preferred aspect of the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention as a completed construction FIG. 2 is a view along line 2 2 of Fig. 1 FIG. 3 is a greatly enlarged plan view illustrating a section of the formed surface of reflective sheeting comprising one aspect of the present invention FIG. 4 is a somewhat schematic and symbolic view of the processes and machinery utilized in a preferred aspect of the present invention FIG. 5 is a plan view of one form of screen pattern used to apply the hydrophobic granular layer of the present invention FIG. B is an enlarged view, in partial detail, of an individual cell of the sheeting of the present invention and FIG. 7 is an enlarged perspective view illustrating a second preferred embodiment of the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention. Referring now to Fig. 3, the numeral 10 indicates generally a segment of cube corner type retroreflective thermoplastic web used in forming the laminate of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 3, there is depicted the rear surface of a portion of flexible retroreflective sheeting 12 fashioned from transparent thermoplastic material in web form which has formed thereon, preferably by embossing, a retroreflective and repeating pattern of cube corner reflector elements characterized by cube faces 14, 16 and 18. In a preferred aspect of such sheeting, sheet 12 is formed from an impact modified acrylic material having UV inhibitors or absorbers added thereto, and which, prior to embossing, bad parallel front and back surfaces and was initially on the order of about 0.006 inches thick. One such material is known as Plexiglas DR, sold by the Rohm and Haas Company. The cubecorner pattern formed on sheeting 12 is formed in an optically precise, finelyZdetailed pattern. For example, as seen in Fig. 2, the depth to which the cube corner pattern is embossed onto sheet 12 may be of the order of 0.00338 inch dimension X . As shown at dimension Y in Fig. 3, the cubes formed on sheet 12 may be spaced apart by a distance on the order of about 0.0072 inch, for the depth as shown at X as set forth above. While the cube pattern shown in Fig. 1 illustrates cubes formed with their optical axes normal to the face of sheet 12, it is to be understood that other versions and patterns may also be utilized as forming the retroreflective web of the laminate of the present invention. Referring now to Fig. 1, the numeral 20 indicates generally a roll of retroreflective laminate 22 manufactured in accordance with preferred aspects ot the present invention to be described hereinbelow. As herein shown, laminate 22 is rolled onto a core 2. A thermoplastic web 28 having a front or obverse surface 28 and a rear or reverse surface 30 upon which is embossed the cube corner type retroreflective pattern is illustrated in Fig. 3. The thermoplastic web 26 may be on the order of about 6 mils in thickness 0.006 inch . Bonded to the reverse surface 30 of the thermoplasticweb 26 is backcoating or film 32. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, a hydrophobic granular silica material 34 is interposed between the backcoat film 32 and the reverse side 30 in a manner to be described hereinbelow. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a layer of adhesive 36 is bonded to a release sheet 38 in a presently well known fashion, and is thereafter bonded to cured backcoat film 32 in order to provide a finished laminate 22 which includes a pressure sensitive or heat activated adhesive layer 36 applied to sheeting 12 in a manner which preserves the retrorenective qualities and properties of the cube corner pattern embossed thereon. The release sheet 38 is used to protect adhesive layer 36 until it is desired to apply laminate 22 to a given surface. Fig. 4 shows, in schematic form, a preferred arrangment of equipment and sequence of operations to produce a retroreflective sheeting laminate of the type shown in Fig. 3. The application of adhesive directly to the reverse side of a cube corner embossed thermoplastic web 26 will cause an undesirable and unacceptable loss of retroreflective capability. This arises from the contact of the adhesive material with the obverse side of embossed thermoplastic web 26, i.e.. the filling of the valleys formed by the embossed pattern and the subsequent interface formed between substances that are too similar in refractive indices to produce adequate retroreflection, so the transparent film can no longer utilize the phenomenon of total internal reflection to efficiently effect retrorenection of light.To solve this problem, a substantial portion of the cube corner pattern either must be hermetically sealed with an air space between the back wall and the cube corner elements, or the cube corner elements must be backed in a way which would preserve the retroreflective properties of the formed web while providing sits for firm attachment of an adhesive layer or other adhesive material . Without such protection, and without such attaching sites, the use of, and effeetiveness of a retroreflective embossed web is seriously compromised and curtailed. Unexpectedly, use of hydrophobic granular materials has been found to afford such protection of optical properties. Among such materials ore xylenated glass particles, powdered silicone rubber, and silane treated silica. As part of the present invention, it has been found that a hydrophobic silica mixture consisting principally of amorphous silica treated with silanes, when used to fill the valleys formed by the embossed pattern, preserves the retroreflective properties of the formed pattern for most practical purposes. Again, it is not known precisely why this effect obtains it has been theorized that the point contact of granules with the reverse face of the embossed thermoplastic web acts to preserve the retroreflective properties of the pattern, perhaps by preserving a sufficient air interface with the reverse side of the cube corner pattern.However, the present invention obtains excellent results even where the primary silica particles used are significantly smaller than, for example, the particles discussed in prior art patents such as Holmen, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,924,929. Use of such silica offers advantages such as low price, availability, and ease and precision of formulation. It further provides unique color and reflective characteristics to the film which improves the appearance of the film even relative to the glass bead types heretofore commonly used. As discussed hereinabove with respect to the Holmen, et al. reference, others have attempted to solve the problem of loss of reflectivity by providing upstanding walls or septa as part of the rigid molded front face pattern, with the septa forming individual pockets for the application of granular compounds having particle sizes far in excess of the silica particles used in the present invention.The disadvantages to such an approach, particularly with respect to the cube corner type embossed pattern utilized in the present invention are manifest. Use of rigid septa limits the size and shape of the cell. A separate mold must be formed for each type of retroreflective sheeting requiring a cell size other than that formed in the original mold. What is meant by the term cell size is the area bounded by or closed off by the walls to form a single pocket for the granular backing material. Pormation of such septa in a relatively rigid mold pattern manufactured to as fine and precise a degree of detail as that shown in the present invention also may cause problems with respect to stripping the formed thermoplastic web from the forming tool. This may particularly be a problem where the septa or walls extend inwardly into the mold to a distance greater than the depth of the cubed corner pattern. A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes the mixing of a hydrophobic silica mixture using hydoophobic silica, organic solvents, and thiekencrst and the application of this mixture, while in a liquid form, to the reverse side of the formed thermoplastic web in a desired pattern. One advantage of the present process and product is that the pattern can conveniently be changed to effect changes in reflective capability of the film, without changing the tools used in forming the embossed web. Thereafter, the partially coated or imprinted thermoplastic web is passed through a drying oven which drives off the solvents used to form the mixture, thereby drying the pattern on the thermoplastic sheet.The pattern in which the silica is applied to the thermoplastic web leaves selected portions or sites on the formed face of the thermoplastic web devoid of silica. Referring now to Fig. 5, the numeral 40 indicates generally such a selected pattern. Each runner or path 42 represents an area on the reverse surface of thermoplastic web 26 where no silica has been deposited. Each square or diamondrhaped area 44 represents an area on the surface of thermoplastic web 26 onto which the silica mixture has been deposited. As seen in Fig. 6, the actual percentage of area covered by the silica mixture is determined by the thickness or width of each runner or path 42, and the pattern selected for deposition of the silica, with the cell 44 having an area bounded by the runners 42, and fully available for the reception and retroreflection of incident light by the embossed retroreflective patterns shown partially at 46. Referring now to Fig. 4, it may be seen that thermoplastic web 26 may be drawn directly from an associated forming machine not herein specifically shown in a continuous process, or may be drawn from a separate supply reel onto which the embossed web 26 has been wound not herein specifically shown . If desired, web 26 may be supported by a backing sheet not herein specifically shown coextensive with obverse face 28, leaving reverse surface 30 exposed. It should be noted that reference to web 26 also includes reference to a laminate formed by web 26 and a backing sheet such as described hereinabove. Web 26 is drawn by, for example, powered rollers not herein specifically shown , to silica mixture application station 48. As herein diagrammatically shown, a preferred means and method of applying the silica mixture to web 26 may be accomplished through use of a screen printing cylinder 50 which has mounted about the outer periphery thereof, a metal screen formed to provide the shape or pattern to which it is desired to apply the silica mixture. The mixture is forced under pressure from the interior of screen printing drum onto the reverse side 30 of the thermoplastic web 26. As herein shown, the web 26 Is directed by idler roller 52 to pass between the screen printing drum 50 and a backing roller 54. A preferred form of the apparatus utilized to apply the silica mixture at application station 48 consists of a drum printer manufactured by Stork Brabant BV of Boxmeer, Holland, of the type having a drum with electro formed mesh screens over which a photo resist pattern such as used for conventional silk screen may be mounted, with a screen pattern providing a diamond cell size in the range of from about 0.096 inch to 0.300 inch, and a runner or cell wall thickness of from about 0.010 inch to about 0.050 inch. Variations in the shape of the cells, pattern repeat of the cells, and thickness of the runners may be accomplished by changing the printing screen used on screen printing drum 50.Also, the constant width of the web may be of various sizes, and the printing screens used will be of a compatible width. In its preferred form, the silica mixture is made from a hydrophobic silica such as that manufactured by the Pigments Division of Degussa, of Frankfurt,West Germany, under the trade designation Sipernat DIO. A preferred composition of the mixture includes hydrophobic silica in a mixture containing approximately 98 percent silane treated silicon dioxide SiO2 0.8 percent sodium oxide Na2O , and 0.8 percent of sulfur trioxide SO3 a non polar aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent carrier a polar solvent and, where desired or required, a thickening agent. One aliphatic non polar hydrocarbon solvent successfully used is low odor mineral spirits, and a workable mixture has been created through use of an organic alcohol, preferably butanol, as the polar solvent material.A smectite clay based thixotropic thickener also may be used in varying amounts to produce a well defined screenprinted pattern of the silica slurry on the embossed thermoplastic web. In its preferred embodiment, the primary particle size of the silica is about 18 nanometers, and the agglomerated particle size of the hydrophobic silica in its final form is about 5 microns. However, it will be understood that the only critical limitation on the particle size is such that the area in which it is deposited will be substantially impervious to the backcoating material 32, whereby the backcoating material is unable to penetrate the hydrophobic silica and interact with the cube corner pattern except in those areas devoid of the silica. The particular combination of solvents and thickeners is important to satisfactory deposition and definition of the silica in a precise and accurate pattern.Screen printing of particulate material commonly requires use of resins or other binders to hold the deposited particles in place. A resin or binder cannot however be used in this instance because of the adverse effect on reflectivity of the web because of refractive index similarities. Another important consideration is the rheology, or flow characteristics of the silica slurry as it Is forced through the printing screen. The slurry must relax, or thin as it is forced through the screen apertures, and thereafter regain sufficient viscosity to retain a weildefined pattern with good leveling qualities and appearance characteristics. Yet another consideration is use of a solvent vehicle which obtains the aforementioned qualities without attacking or degrading the thermoplastic web upon which the retroreflective pattern it formed. Use of polar solvents, such as butanol, enables the slurry to maintain an increased concentration of solids silica . Such solvents, however, react with the thermoplastic material used to form the web. Non polar solvents, such as mineral spirits, preserve the embossed web, yet do not act to provide a satisfactory silica pattern. Therefore a blend of polar and non polar solvents has been found to be useful in carrying enough solids without degrading reflectivity or degrading the web. Preferably, the hydrophobic silica is present in proportions ranging from about 15 percent to about 35 percent by weight, the non polar solvent carrier is present in amounts ranging from about 40 percent to about 70 percent, the polar solvent is present in amounts ranging from about 10 percent to about 30 percent, and the thickening agent may be present in amounts from about 2 percent to about 8 percent. One preferred formulation of the silica mixture includes 20 percent by weight Sipernat DlO hydrophobic silica, 56 percent mineral spirits, 20 percent butanol, and 4 percent thickener. It has been found that such proportions preserve the web while providing a useful silica pattern. After application of the silica mixture, web 26 is passed through a heating oven 56 where the resulting silica pattern is heated to drive off the organic solvents without heating web 26 to the point where heat distortion of the cubecorner elements of the laminate will occur. After drying, the silica is mechanically held to the cube corner elements on the reverse face 30 of web 26 by, it is believed, electrostatic forces and physical inter engagement of the silica particles themselves. Thus, as web 26 exits mixture application station 48, it has taken on the form of a first modified laminate 58, i.e.. a web 26 having cube corner elements with a precisly formed pattern of silica mixture screened thereon over a portion of the elements, with an uncovered portion of the cube corner elements still exposed.As modified laminate 58 exits drying oven 56, it take on a second modified laminate construction 60 wherein the solvents present in the silica mixture have been driven off and the silica itself has remained dried into its screened on pattern. The second modified laminate 60 then enters a backecating applieation station 62. The application of a waterbased backcoating accomplishes several results. First, those areas onto which no silica has been screened or deposited will allow direct contact between the backcoating and the reverse side 30 of the embossed or otherwise formed thermoplastic web 26, thus wetting web 26 with the liquid backcoating mixture. Second, a layer of backcoating material will overlay the silica pattern formed on thermoplastic web 26 and, when applied effectively, will not disturb or disrupt the printed or screened on silica pattern.Third, the backcoating may then be dried and or cured to provide a firm attachment to thermoplastic web 26 to provide a flat, smooth and integral surface upon which further layers, such as a layer of pressuresensitive or heat activated adhesive may be effectively and conveniently applied, and to protectively cover or encapsulate the silica pattern. A surprising and unexpected result is that the silica prevents permeation by the liquid backcoating to the cube corner pattern. As described above, such permeation would adversely affect the renectivity of the final assembled laminate. Application of the backcoating mixture to the second modified laminate 60 may be accomplished in a number of ways, such as by spraying, roller application, squeegeeing, or the like. The manner in which the backcoat is applied will be determined by, inter alia, the precise formulation of the backcoat and the pressure, or force, which can be withstood by the silica pattern after it has been dried. For purposes of illustration, a backcoating application station 62 may be characterized as having a supply header or tank 64 communicating with an application means 66 which may be a nozzle or series of nozzles, or the like. An implement such as a doctor blade 68 may be used to more uniformly spread the backcoating after it has been applied without damaging the silica pattern. A platen 70 provides support for the second modified laminate 60 during application of the backcoat. After application, the third modified laminate 72 enters drying oven 74 wherein the backcoat material is heat cured, resulting in backcoating layer 32 as shown in Fig. 1. Successful use of a backeoating requires that the backcoating formulation meet several particularly important working parameter. One is that the backcoating have now characteristics such that the relatively narrow and shallow runners formed by the silica pattern will be filled, while not dervetting or disturbing the dried silica pattern itself. This means that the viscosity of the backeoating must be carefully controlled to assure that the backcoating can be applied while completely encapsulating without disturbing the silica pattern. Another characteristic is that the backcoating cannot penetrate or interact with the applied silica to reach the interface between the silica and the cube corner pattern.Yet another requirement is that the backcoating, when dried, have the required flexibility and toughness to withstand use in a laminate. Ideally, the backcoating should also be of a color which enhances daytime visibility of articles made with such laminates. Several preferred backcoatings have been utilized. Each may be characterized generally as including a water borne or water based polymeric mixture or system, a whitening agent, a defoamer, a thickener for use in adjusting the final viscosity, and a pH adjusting component. A first preferred formulation of a backcoating is presented herewith asExample 1 Example 1 1. DP 101, a water borne polymeric system consisting of about 34 acrylic urethane copolymer, 61 water and 5 coalescent solvent, such as M pyrol 69.7 to 79.7 2. UCD 106OQ, a pre dispersed whitening agent titanium dioxide containing about 72 solids 21.5 to 23.5 3. Balab 3017A, a defoamer 0.4 to 0.B 4. CP 15 50 percent in water acrylic based thickener to adjust viscosity 1.5 to 2.5 5.

Referring now to Fig. 2, a partial sectional view of a schematic portion of embossed thermoplastic web 26 after application of both silica 34 and backcoating 32 is shown. As therein seen, reverse side 30 of thermoplastic web includes a series of valleys, indicated generally at 76. The valleys 76 schematically represent the cube corner elements found in web 26 when the cube corner pattern shown in Fig. 1 is embossed onto thermoplastic web 26. When the silica layer 34 is applied, the valleys between adjacent cube corner elements 76 are filled except where the screen pattern leaves web 26 exposed and, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, enough silica 34 is applied to extend a distance of about 0.0001 to about 0.003 inch above the embossed surface of thermoplastic web 26, as characterized by dimension A of Fig. 2.In like fashion, the backcoat layer 32 is applied to a thickness B of about 0.002 to about 0.004 inch above the silica layer 34. Where runners or paths 42 are formed, each such runner consists of the backeoat material which extends downward to wet the floor of each valley 76 to a total depth C, as shown in Fig. 2 which, preferrably, is about 0.006 inch. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each such runner is 0.001 inch deep and, as characterized by dimension D in Figs. 2 and 6, may be on the order of 0.015 inch wide. In the embodiment herein illustrated, each discrete element of the applied silica pattern is square in shape with the length of each side of the square characterized by dimension E in Figs. 2 and 8. As hereinabove described, the percentage of surface area available for retroreflection may be adjusted by adjusting the dimensions D and B as shown in Figs. 2 and B. Where, for example, dimensionD is 0.015 inch and dimension E is 0.200 inch, the effective surface available for retroreflection is s4 percent. Where dimension D is 0.027 inch and dimension E is 0.138 inch, approximately 70 percent of the surface of the resulting sheet preserves retroreflective eharaeteristics. With a dimension D of 0.029 inch and a dimension B of 0.096 inch, approximately 55 percent of the total surface of the resulting sheet retains retroreflective properties. Thus, the degree to which the resulting laminar sheet returns incident light towards its source may be adjusted independent of the actual cube corner type pattern formed on thermoplastic web 26, in a manner which is much more convenient and efficacious than changing the mold dimensions or characteristics used to produce the embossed cube corner pattern. Referring again to Figs. 1 and 4, after fourth modified laminate 84 exits drying oven 74, a pressure sensitive or heat activated adhesive layer 36 may then be applied by taking the resulting laminate 84 and drawing it past a station where a backing or release sheet 38, precoated with adhesive 36, may be layered directly onto backcoating 38, resulting in a completed laminate 22 as shown in Fig. 1.Finally, if one is used, the carrier sheet is stripped away, exposing obverse face 28 as the light receiving surface of the finished laminate 22. It should be noted that the foregoing examples and preferred embodiments have been presented with respect to a cube corner embossed pattern having a depth characterized by dimension X in Fig. 2 of 0.004 inch. It is contemplated that patterns of varying depth and varying dimensions may be utilized, and that the dimensions herein discussed for the depth of silica applied, and the width and depth of the runners therby formed, may be varied without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as herein discussed. The finished sheet will have the physical characteristics enabling it to substantially meet specification FP 79 for reflective sheeting, and its reflective properties can easily be varied by utilizing a different screen pattern. Moreover, the whiteness achieved by the existing laminate backcoating substantially enhances the daylight esthetics of the finished material. The heating of the laminate during the drying and curing of the silica, backcoating or adhesive, also may have an effect on the final reflective performance of the laminate, dependent upon the characteristics of the initial tool and the material chosen for the film.It has been determined that for optimum performance, the laminate should not be heated above 1800P during these various processing steps for the preferred embodiment disclosed herein. It may also be noted that while the silica pattern herein presented is a series of squares turned to present a diamondlike pattern, other cell sizes and shapes are also possible, wherever they appear efficacious for purposes of performance or appearance, and are within the spirit and scope of the invention as herein discussed and claimed. As previously noted, Fig. 7 illustrates another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a layer 25 of a more weather resistant thermoplastic material than that forming web 26, such as unmodified or UV modified, polymethyl methacrylate, is laminated to the impact modified acrylic forming web 26. In its preferred form, layer 25 will be about .0003 inch, and will not exceed .0005 inch 0.5 mil in thickness. It has been found that the provision of this added layer provides additional weathering characteristics needed for certain environments, while, when not exceeding the noted thickness, permits the total laminate to remain sufficiently flexible.Preferred materials in this embodiment may be that sold under the trade designation V052 or V044 by the Rohm HaasCompany, or a polyarylate sold under the trade designation Ardel, by Union Carbide.Various techniques may be employed to apply this outer layer to the web before the silica and backcoating is applied. For example, the additional layer of thermoplastic material may be applied by solvent casting or may be co extruded with the initial film. A preferred formulation for the outer layer 25 includes use of Korad D, the trade name of a modified polymethyl methacrylate manufactured by PolymericExtruded Products, Inc. of Newark, New Jersey. Such material includes U.V. light absorbing substances, and is cross linked to a flexible, rubber base substance, adding flexibility. In particular, use of Tinuvin 234, a benzotriazol compound manufactured by Geigy, is used as a UV inhibitor. This substance is known chemically as 242H benzotriazol 2 ylk4 methyl phenol. Korad D thermoplastic is described inUnited States Patent No. 3,562,235, issued on February 9, 1971. When Korad D thermoplastic is used, it may be applied as a 2 mil outer layer during the cube forming process, or it may be co extruded with the web 26 before such formation, in a layer 1 mil thick, or it may be applied in solution directly to the web 26 in a layer 1 2 mil thick. The particular thickness will depend in part on tha total thickness parameters of the finished laminate. While the foregoing has presented various specific preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments have been presented by way of example only. It is expected that others will perceive differences which, while varying from the foregoing, do not depart from the spririt and scope of the invention as herein claimed and described.
