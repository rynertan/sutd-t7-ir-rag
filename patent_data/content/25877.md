# Ink jet printing head and ink jet printer.

## Abstract
A drop on demand ink jet printing apparatus in which the print head has an ink cavity 22 which is filled with ink, and which has a nozzle orifice 26 designed so that ink does not flow out under static conditions. A fluid inlet chamber 28 is provided to receive ink from an ink supply pipe 24 and this chamber 28 is separated from the ink cavity 22 by a narrow gap 32. An electromechanical transducer 36 is mounted on a flexible plate 34 overlying the gap 32 between the ink cavity 22 and the inlet chamber 28. The transducer is selectively ener gized in response to the print data signals so that, when energized by an electrical signal, the transducer flexes the plate 34 to reduce the volume in the ink cavity 22 to eject one ink drop 19 from the nozzle orifice 26 and substantially to close off the narrow gap 32 to substantially close the back flow path from the ink cavity 22 to the inlet chamber 28 during the formation of the drop of ink.
