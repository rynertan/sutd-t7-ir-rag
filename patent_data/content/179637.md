# Adjustable position control system.

## Abstract
A movable member 11 is positioned to a desired fine position after a coarse position is reacted. As applied to a typewheel 11 positioning system, in a learn mode standard coarse and fine position information is transferred from a ROM 25 to an EAROM 43 . A character key of a keyboard 45 is operated to print the character. If the printed character quality is unsatisfactory, the keyboard is utilized to enter correction signals to alter the position information in the EAROM 43 until satisfactory quality is achieved. This operation is repeated for each character. The system utilizes an optical encoder 59 which produces a pair of phased sinusoidal signals OA, OB which are utilized to effect fine position control after a coarse position has been reached. In the operate mode, the corrected stored position information is utilized to control character printing.
