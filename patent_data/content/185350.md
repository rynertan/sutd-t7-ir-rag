## Description
PROCESS FOR MAKING ACRYLAMIDE AND N SUBSTITUTED ACRYLAMIDES FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to acrylamide andN substituted acrylamides and particularly to methods for making these acrylamides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Acrylamides are a family of crystalline, easily polymerized monomers used in the synthesis of dyes, in adhesives, in paper and textile sizes, in soil conditioning agents, in treating sewage and waste water, in permanent press fabrics, enhancing oil recovery, and in the manufacture of flocculents. Among successful initial processes, acrylamide was produced commercially by reacting approximately equal molar quantities of acrylonitrile, water and sulfuric acid together to form acrylamide sulfate. Acrylamide then was recovered from the sulfate salt, usually by ammonia neutralization , removing the resulting insoluble ammonium sulfate by filtration, and crystallizing the acrylamide from the filtrate. Another procedure for recovering acrylamide from acrylamide sulfate involves the use of an ion exchange technique in which acrylamide sulfate is diluted with water and passed through a cation exchange resin such as a sulfonated copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene . The product is a water solution of acrylamide.The aforementioned sulfuric acid catalyzed process for forming acrylamide has a number of drawbacks that made it desirable to find alternative methods for producing acrylamide. In one improved commercial proposal, acrylamide is formed by the direct hydration of acrylonitrile using a catalyst that typically consists of a mixture of oxides of copper and chromium. While overcoming some difficulties associated with sulfuric acid, this process poses other difficulties in part related to a requirement for substantial dilution as well as the necessity for employing relatively expensive acrylonitrile as a starting material. Nevertheless, this process has found considerable commercial success. This process does have the advantage of producing no waste products of reaction. Acrylamide formed by this process typically is sold commercially as a 50 percent aqueous solution. It previously has been reported that certain organobromides and organoiodides can form amides when reacted with carbon monoxide and organic amines using PdC12 PPh3 2 Ph being phenyl as a catalyst, A. Schoenberg and R. F.Heck, 39 Journal of Organic Chemistry, p. 3327 1974 , the disclosure therein being incorporated herein by reference. It also is reported that lactams can be prepared from bromoalkenes and iodoalkenes that have secondary amine substituents,M. Mori, Y. Washioka, T. Urayama, R. Chiba and Y.Ban, 48 Journal of Organic Chemistry, p. 4058 1983 , the disclosure therein being incorporated herein by reference and that benzolactams can be prepared from ortho bromoaminoalkylbenzenes by photo chemical carbonylation under phase transfer conditions using cobalt carbonyl as the catalyst,J. Brunet, C. Sidot and P. Caubere, 48 Journal ofOrganic Chemistry, p. 1166, 1983 , the disclosure therein being incorporated herein by reference. Although it has been reported that 2 chloropropene can be converted to an anilide by reaction with carbon monoxide, aniline, and a stoichiometric quantity of tri n butylamine,Schoenberg and Heck, supra, the reaction is extremely slow even at elevated temperatures and pressures, with an estimated turnover number mol converted . mol catalyst 1 . hour 1 of between about 1 2 at 1350C and 4137 kPa gauge .The very slow reaction rate would be expected in view of the low activity reported for alkenyl chlorides and aryl chlorides in metallation reactions compared with reaction rates of alkenyl and aryl bromides and iodides, P. Fitton and E. A.Rick, 28 Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, p.287, 1971 J. T. Colman and L. S. Hegedus,Principles and Applications of OrganotransitionMetal Chemistry, p.p. 185 1980 R. F. Heck and B.Patel, Catalysis in Organic Synthesis, SeventhEdition, p. 195 218 J. Brunet, C. Sidot and P.Caubere, 48 Journal of Organic Chemistry, p. 1166 1983 . Even though organobromides and organoiodides have been reported to form amides when reacted with carbon monoxide and organic amines using PdC12 PPh3 2 as a catalyst, it has been found that vinyl chloride monomer does not react with carbon monoxide and ammonia whenPdC12 PPh3 2 is used as a catalyst. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to the catalyzed reaction of 1 vinyl chloride monomer, 2 carbon monoxide, and 3 an amidation agent or amine, as hereinafter termed, to form acrylamides, the reaction being carried out desirably at moderately elevated temperature preferably of 900C or greater, and a pressure preferably at least autogenous. The reaction can be represented by the following chemical equation EMI4.1 tb CH2 CHCl CO SEP 2HNRIRI SEP I SEP SEP Catalys SEP t SEP tb SEP y tb SEP 0 tb CH2aCHCNRIRII C1 SEP B2tRIRII tb The term amine is intended to encompass primary and secondary amines and ammonia the term acrylamides is intended to encompass acrylamide and N substituted acrylamide.R1 RII R I are alkyls, aromatics, or cycloalkyls having 1 10 carbon atoms. The vinyl chloride monomer, carbon monoxide, and the amine are combined, the combination including a catalyst of the form Y zM L n wherein L is one of PR3 and R2P A PR2 . The combination is maintained under agitation at a temperature at least in excess of about 600C under pressure in order to initiate and sustain the reaction. Following completion of the reaction, acrylamide is recovered from the combination. Preferably the amine and carbon monoxide are replenished within the combination of reactants to preclude their exhaustion. In preferred homogenous or single phase reactions, typically liquid phase, vinyl chloride also functions as a solvent or liquid phase carrier.Where due to temperature, volume and pressure, about 30 to about 40 by weight of vinyl chloride charged to a reactor assumes a gaseous state, carbon monoxide is present in the combination at a partial pressure of at least 275 kPa and preferably 345 kPa as measured at 210C preferably the amine is present in the combination in a mole ratio to the vinyl chloride of not less than 0.02 and preferably the catalyst is present in the combination in a quantity of not less than about 0.1 millimole per mole of vinyl chloride present in the liquid phase where a homogeneous phase reaction occurs in a liquid phase. The catalyst is preferably a complex of a platinum group metal and phosphine and typically possesses the form YzM L n wherein L is one ofPR3 and 1R2P A PR2 wherein M is a platinum group metal, R is aryl, substituted aryl, or alkyl such as branched or straight chained alkyl, cyclohexyl, teriary butyl and derivatives thereof having a substitutent X wherein methyl, low molecular weight halogen, fluoromethyl or hydrogen R is typically phenyl, alkyl, or cyclohexyl and nzl 4 2 4 where L PR3, and 1 2 where L ER2P A PR2 , A is a connecting organic radical, M desirably is a palladium 0 or so called zero valent palladium, complexed with a tertiary phosphine and z o. Typically Y is a monovalent anion, but may be divalent, typically being an integer, 0, 1, 2. Vinyl chloride is unique among monochloroalkenes in having a catalyzed rate of reaction with carbon monoxide and ammonia unexpectedly orders of magnitude greater than a rate for its alkylated derivatives. The above and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention which forms a part of the specification. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of a chemical reactor device in which the instant invention may be practiced. BEST EMBODIMENT OF TEE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for producing acrylamides, that is acrylamide andN substituted acrylamides . In the process, reactants are combined with a catalyst and heated to a temperature, generally in excess of 600C, and more typically in excess of 800C, sufficient to activate and sustain the reaction among the reactants. Typically the reaction occurs at an elevated pressure generally the pressure is autogenous pressure. The reactants are comprised of vinyl chloride monomer hereinafter simply vinyl chloride, carbon monoxide, and an amidation agent, hereinafter termed amine. Vinyl chloride is possessed of the formula H2CsCHC1. Vinyl chloride, also known as VCM, is widely commercially available. Carbon monoxide employed in the practice of the invention desirably is free from other combustion products and particularly should be free of oxidizing agents. The absence of such other substances is desirable, if for no other reason, to provide a reduced interference to the carbon monoxide being combined with the other reactants and to improve the quantity of carbon monoxide that can be made available within the confines of a specific reactor volume. The amidation agent or amine is selected from a group consisting of ammonia, primary amines and secondary amines. The primary and secondary amines include one or more carbon chains each having at least one and not more than about ten carbon atoms. The carbon chain may be branched, unbranched, or cyclic, and the carbon chain may be saturated or unsaturated it may be preferable that the carbon chain be saturated as under some conditions unsaturation may contribute to interfering reactions that could lower the effective yield of acylamide resulting from the practice of the process of the invention. The catalyst preferred in the practice of the instant invention is a complex of a platinum group metal with phosphine, generally a teritiary phosphine, and typically possesses the formula YzM L n M is preferably a platinum group metal, but may be cobalt and, with suitable ligands, it is believed iron or nickel. The platinum group comprises palladium, platinum, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and osmium. L is of the form PR3 or R2P A PR2 . R is preferably aryl, substituted aryl, or alkyl such as straight or branched chain alkyl, cyclohexyl, teritary alkyl and derivatives thereof having a substituent X. R is typically a phenyl or cyclohexyl, t butyl, or other alkyl of between 4 and 10 carbon atoms whileX is selected from a group including methyl, fluoromethyl, lower molecular weight halogen, and hydrogen. R may include heteroatoms such as N, S, and 0.In the practice of the invention it is much preferred that R be phenyl. A is a connecting organic radical, aliphatic or aromatic, of between 1 and 6 carbon atoms. Integers, n can be 1 4 and z can be 0 2 in the practice of the invention. It is much preferred that z equal a number corresponding to the platinum group metal being in one of the following states Pd O , Pt O , Rh I , Ir I ,Ru II and Os II termed here catalytic states. Where L is PR3, n 2 4 and z 0 2. Where L is R2P A PR2 , n 1 2 and zX0 2. Y typically is a monovalent anion such as a lower molecular weight halogen like chlorine, but may be divalent.Complex compounds fitting this YzM L 3 stoichiometry can be prepared directly or may generated in situ from suitable metal precursors and the appropriate stoichiometric amount of phosphine. Therefore, where n is less than a number required to place the platinum group metal in the catalytic state, it is much preferred in the practice of the invention that a stoichiometric quantity of the phosphine that is complexed with the platinum group metal be added into the combination of reactants to provide a phosphine presence in the combination at least equivalent to the presence that would have been achieved had sufficient phosphine been included in the platinum group metal complex to place the platinum group metal complex in the catalytic state.Particularly, where the amine is ammonia or a primary amine, the addition of this stoichiometric quantity of phosphine may provide a desirable effect upon the rate at which the reaction proceeds. In situ generation of Pd PR3 n where n 2 4 can be accomplished from Pd3 TBAA 3CHCl3 where TBAA is tribenzylidene acetylacetone and a stiochiometrically appropriate quantity of phosphine as shown by Ishi, Y., et al, 73 Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, pp 411 1974 and 16 A Chubic Kogyo Kiyo, A, pp 103 1980 . In situ generation of Pd PR3 4 where R is phenyl can be accomplished by amine reduction ofPdC12 PR3 2 in the presence of PR3 where the amine is either primary or secondary and includes at least one alkyl substituent. Modest improvements in catalytic performance as evidenced by reaction rate are available particularly where R is phenyl and X is a strongly electron donating para substituent.Typically the reaction rate increases only by a factor 3 4 as X varies from strongly electron withdrawing to strongly electron donating. Where R is a bulky alkyl, such as t butyl, significant rate increases may be observed. The platinum group metal is selected from a group consisting of palladium, platinum, osmium rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium. Platinum, rhodium and palladium are preferred in the practice of the invention and palladium is much preferred in the practice of the invention. The combination of reactants and catalyst must be heated to initiate a commercially reasonable rate of reaction to produce acrylamides. It is believed that for commercial utility the temperature must be elevated to at least 800C and much preferably to at least 900C to cause production of acrylamides at a significant rate. In the lab, meaningful reaction rates more typically require a temperature of at least 800C. Maintaining the combination of reactants and catalysts at approximately 90 1100C during reaction has been found to produce satisfactory results.Reactor cooling may be required. Upper limitations on temperature, it is believed, are established by catalyst instability and the possibility for polymerization of the acrylamide being produced and or the vinyl chloride monomer. Additionally, as the temperature of the combination of reactants and catalysts is elevated, the pressure associated with the combination becomes more elevated, and pressure limitations inherent to physical limitations associated with the equipment in which the combination of reactants is being processed may establish an ultimate temperature ceiling.Additionally, a CO partial pressure in excess of about 2440 kPa measured at 220C can cause a reduction in catalytic rate. It is preferred that the combination of reactants be agitated during periods where reaction is desired thereby assisting in maintaining equilibrium during reaction, particularly where a liquid phase reaction is contemplated. It is also believed advantageous, particularly where ammonia is being employed as an amine in a liquid phase reaction, to agitate the vapor spaces of any reaction vessel in addition to the liquid phase to rapidly achieve vapor liquid equilibrium.Agitation can be accomplished in any suitable or conventional well known manner. The principal product of the reaction is an acrylamide. It is believed that the reaction proceeds as follows CH2 CHCl 2HNR1R11 COCH2 CHCONRIRII Cl HN RIRIIEMI10.1 where RI and R11 are either hydrogen, or branched, unbranched, or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains having between one and about 10 carbon atoms. RI and RII need not be identical. Where the reaction is run in a low concentration of amines such as ammonia, primarily the acrylamide results from the catalytic reaction. However, where a more elevated level of amine is present, a significant proportion of the acrylamide produced by the catalytic reaction then further reacts with the amine to form a Michael addition product by the reactionEMI11.1 For example, where the amine is dimethylamine, theMichael addition product or adduct is 3 dimethylamino N,N dimethylpropanamide, but for ammonia 3,3 ,3 nitrilotripropanamide is the addition product with acrylamide. The hydrochloride of the Michael adduct is also obtained. The Michael reaction may be reversed to obtain an acrylamide, accomplished according to well known techniques such as by heating under vacuum the Michael adduct to a temperature of about between 1600C and 2000C. Catalyst is deactivated slowly during the reaction by a competing addition reaction with the acrylamide by which the phosphine ligand is consumed.EMI11.2 Palladium freed of phosphine may react with vinyl chloride in the combination of reactants but it is believed to separate from solution as metallic palladium and ceases to function catalytically.The reaction of the acrylamide with the phosphine appears to be somewhat dependent upon the concentration of acrylamide present in the combination of reactants. Therefore, any chemical or mechanical method for rapidly and effectively removing the acrylamide being formed from the reaction medium can improve catalyst stability. Operating with an excess of an amine that adds to acrylamide very rapidly and or the use of an elevated concentration of amine consistant with an acceptable rate of reaction can remove the acrylamide from the combination of reactants as aMichael reaction product and can thereby effectively reduce the drain posed by the competing reaction between phosphine and acrylamide upon the catalyst function. Excess phosphine, while depressing catalytic rates, can prolong catalyst life. The form in which the catalyst is introduced into the combination of reactants can be important to the success of the reaction.Typically, the platinum group metal is in a state, or catalytic state as used herein of Pd O , Pt O ,Rh I , Ir I , Ru II and Os II . Where palladium is of the form Pd PR3 n n 2 4 . Typically for palladium, n 4, but upon introduction of the palladium catalyst into vinyl chloride monomer, such palladium complexes are known to disassociate readily to yield coordinatively unsaturated complexes, the dissociation being at least in part a function of the phosphine ligands as set forth byTolman, C.A., 77 Chem. Revs. pp 313 1977 .Such coordinatively unsaturated complexes are believed responsible for catalytic activity and, at least with vinyl chloride, the reaction is believed to occur by an oxidative addition process as follows EMI12.1 EMI13.1 B2C CHCONRIRII C1 tRIRII Pd PR3 n It has been found that the rate at which the reactants form acrylamide is relatively insensitive to the basicity of the amine. It has been noticed that a greater initial concentration of ammonia, where employed as the amine in the reactant combination, can suppress the rate at which the reactants form acrylamide. This phenomenon is believed related to ammonia functioning as ligands for palladium thereby reducing the concentration of active, coordinatively unsaturated catalyst.Conversely, where dimethylamine is employed, a greater initial concentration of dimethylamine in the combination of reactants can result in a more rapid rate of reaction. It has been found that excessive quantities of carbon monoxide present in the combination of reactants can reduce the overall rate of reaction, it is believed, for the same reasons set forth for ammonia. The reaction of the instant invention may be practiced in an apparatus as depicted in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, a reactor 10 available from Autoclave Engineers as a so calledZipperclave made of stainless steel having a capacity of 500 milliliters is provided with a glass liner 12. The reactor 10 is provided with a rupture disk 14. A thermostated mantle 16 is provided, capable of receiving the 500 milliliter stainless steel reactor 10 for accurate control of temperature within the reactor 10. An air motor 17 driven agitator 18 is provided by which paddles 20 within the reactor may be activated. A vacuum line 22 is provided upon the reactor including a metering cock 24, and a stop cock 26. A sampling line 28 including block valves 29 is provided. An inlet line 30 is provided including a U tube 32, a pressure gauge 34, a three way cock 36, including a port 37 for introducing gases, a metering valve 38, a carbon monoxide inlet cock 40 and block valves, 41, 42. The reactor 10 and associated equipment were employed in the generation of acrylamides as set forth in the examples that follow.Example 1. A 100 milliliter 3 neck flask was fitted with an inert gas inlet, a thermometer, a gas bubbler, a magnetic stirring bar, and a port including a rubber septum. The flask was purged with nitrogen and charged with 60 milliliters ofDMSO, 6.55 grams 0.025 moles of triphenylphosphine, and 0.885 grams 5.00 millimoles of palladium chloride. Under agitation and an inerted atmosphere, here argon, the mixture was heated to 1400C to produce a solution. The mixture was then allowed to cool slowly under agitation. At 1300C 1.18 grams 0.020 moles of 85 hydrazine hydrate was added employing a syringe over approximately two minutes. Allowed to crystalize, the product was filtered through a course scintered glass disk under nitrogen and was washed twice with 10 milliliter aliquots of ethanol followed by pentane washes. Drying was accomplished employing flowing nitrogen at room temperature to yield 5.43 grams 4.70 millimoles of yellow crystals at a 94 yield. The resulting tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium was employed in the practice of the invention. Example 2. In a typical acrylamide reaction, the reactor 10 having a glass liner 12 was charged 0.36 moles tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium catalyst and evacuated to less than 26 Pa employing the line 22. The reactor 10 was immersed in an ice bath 63.4 grams 1.01 moles vinyl chloride was condensed into the reactor by vapor transfer. The catalyst VCM mixture was agitated while venting 800 ml of VCM vapor employing the line 28 as a purge leaving 61.4 grams 0.983 moles of VCM in the reactor. The reactor was placed in the mantle 16.The U tube 32 was evacuated, cooled in liquid nitrogen, and the three way cock 36 was opened to condense the amine, here ammonia, into the U tube.The three way valve 36 was adjusted to permit flow from the U tube 32 to the valve 42, and as theU tube was warmed with hot tap water, the valve 42 was opened to admit the ammonia into the reactor 10. The reactor 10 was then rapidly pressurized with carbon monoxide with the agitator 18 idle through the valves 40, 41, 36, 42 and the U tube 32. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide as noted herein is the difference between pressure in the reactor 10 immediately before and after introduction of carbon monoxide and before any heating or agitation. The reactor was heated to 1000C while stirred. Based upon known vapor pressure and density data, it was believed that about 53 milliliters of VCM remained in the liquid state after heating. Ammonia disappearance was monitered by gas chromotography employing a 0.32 cm x 183 cm silanized column packed with 80 100 meshPoropak PS operated at 600C.VCM was the internal standard. The sample was the piping volume between the valves 29 in the line 28 which was maintained at 1200C. At the conclusion of the reaction, the mantle was removed and the reactor 10 was cooled in ice water. After venting while stirred and opening the reactor, the contents thereof were extracted with 50 100 milliliters of D20 and the resulting solution filtered. The weight of the combined extract was determined and teriary butanol was added as an internal reference for quantitative R NMR analysis. VC1 conversions were determined by potentiometric titration for chloride using silver nitrate aqueous and a chloride specific electrode. Reported yields are based upon these chloride titrations. This Example was repeated varying the quantities of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and catalyst included in the reactor. The results are set forth in Table I wherein R in the catalyst is a phenyl group. The initial rate of ammonia consumption is the value reported in Table I. TABLE I.

Example 2 was repeated employing a catalyst of the form PdC12 PPh3 2 in each repetition .36 millimoles of catalyst and .12 moles of ammonia were introduced into the reactor and the reactor was pressurized to a carbon monoxide partial pressure of 240 pounds per square inch and the reaction was maintained at 1000C for approximately 280 minutes.

The effect of methyl substitution on vinyl chloride was determined by repeating Example 2 with the vinyl chloride being replaced in three separate examples by 48 grams of cis , trans , and 2 chlorpropene respectively, the quantities being selected to give approximately the same liquid volume in the reactor as obtained with the vinyl chloride monomer at 1000C Reactions utilizing chloropropenes were conducted at 1000C for approximately 280 minutes and the results are compared with those for vinyl chloride as follows Yield Ratea Reactant relative Products mol basis H2C CHC1 74 N CH2CH2CONH2 3 71 Cl HN CH2CH2CONH2 3 7 Acrylamide 7 Cl Ph3P CH2CH2CONH2 1 cis CH3 HC CHC1 2. cis CH3 HC CHCON 66 trans CH3 HC CHCl 1. trans CH3 HC CHCONH2 51H2C C CH3 C1 1.

The effect of solvent upon the reaction of Example 2 was investigated by repeating Example 2 employing .12 moles of ammonia, .36 moles ofPd PPh3 4 catalyst where Ph is phenyl and charging the reactor employing a 1655 kPa partial pressure carbon monoxide. In one such run, the 19.1 grams of vinyl chloride charged to the reactor was augmented with 26.1 grams of acetonitrile and in another run the 19.1 grams vinyl chloride charged was augmented by 30.7 grams of toluene.The solvent quantities were selected to produce approximately the same volume within the reactor at 1000C as is present when employing vinyl chloride.The reaction rates as measured by ammonia disappearance in mol.min 1 . 104 were 13.0, 6.8 and 10.0 for vinyl chloride, acetonitrile vinyl chloride, and toluene vinyl chloride respectively.The product mix from the acetonitrile vinyl chloride run yielded nitrilotripropanamide 57 on a mol basis , nitrilotripropanamide.HCl 18 on a mol basis , acrylamide 5.7 on a mol basis , and phosphonium salt 3.6 of on a mol basis .Example 10. Example 2 was repeated employing as the amine .12 moles of dimethylamine, and as catalyst .36 millimoles of Pd Ph2PCE2CH2PPh2 generated in situ from 0.184 grams of Pd3 TBAA 3CHCl3 and .148 grams of l,2 bis diphenylphosphino ethane. Conversion of the dimethylamine was 86 by weight in 21 hours after which an additional 0.10 mole of dimethylamine was charged to the reactor together with sufficient additional carbon monoxide so that the original total pressure was restored to the reactor at 900C. The reaction was stopped after a total reaction time of 26 hours. The initial rate of dimethylamine consumption as measured by gas chromotography through a 26 conversion was 1.1 x 10 4 mol min 1.This rate compares with 14 x 10 4 mol min 1 obtained under the same conditions using Pd PPh3 4. The reaction product was 3 dimethylamino N,N dinethylpropanamide at a 98 yield by weight.Example 11. Example 2 was repeated employing as the amine 21.9 grams 0.12 moles of di n hexylamine the reaction being conducted for 20 hours. Following cooling and venting, the residue was stirred with 55 milliliters of ethanol and filtered. As measured by chloride titration, vinyl chloride conversion was 52 millimoles. Mass spectrometry showed the product to comprise di n hexylammonium chloride, N, N di n hexylacrylamide, 3 di n hexylamino N,N di n hexylpropanamide and little or no unreacted di n hexylamine. A fraction of the ethanol extract was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in methanol d4.Toluene was added as an internal reference for quantitative 1H NMR analysis which revealed a product mix ofN,N di n hexylacrylamide 79 on a mol basis and 3 di n hexylamine N,N di n hexylpropanamide 29 on a mol basis , the latter being estimated from overlapping peaks. Thus even extended chain primary and secondary amines can be employed in the practice of the instant invention. From the foregoing examples it should be apparent that large and small alkylamines and weakly basic aromatic amines find utility in the practice of the instant invention. Further, particularly with palladium based catalyst, the reaction proceeds quite rapidly and can provide an extended catalyst life. Particularly, some dialkylamines possess the capability for rapidly removing acrylamide by Michael addition and rapidly reducing Pd2 complexes to Pd O complexes under reaction conditions. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described in detail, it should be apparent that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the claims that follow.
