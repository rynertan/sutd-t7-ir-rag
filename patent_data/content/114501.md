# Structural connections.

## Abstract
A structural connection between a tubular thermosetting plastics member 6 and a thermoplastics end cap 8 is described. An end of the tubular member is inserted into an annular, axially extending gap 18 in the thermoplastics end cap 8 . The inner and outer wall surfaces of the gap 18 are threaded. Adhesive fills the space between the end of the tubular member and the threaded surfaces of the gap.
