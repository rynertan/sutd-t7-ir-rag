# Burner control system.

## Abstract
An electronic control system 10 for safely operating a pair of redundant solenoid type valves 14, 16 15, 17 utilizes an alternating current potential 25, 26 for ener gizing the valves. The first valve coil 14 is energized across the applied potential by a first SCR 52 and then is placed in series with the second valve coil 15 . The second valve coil 15 is energized when applying the A. C. potential 25, 26 to a series circuit including the first and second valve coils 14, 15 and a second SCR 56 . The series combination is selected so that once the valves are energized they will stay open in the series configuration.
