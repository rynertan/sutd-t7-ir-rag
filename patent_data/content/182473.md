# Inlet system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An inlet manifold which has long inlet tracts 12 has valves 26, 28 at the downstream ends of the tracts to control the air flow close to the cylinder head 24. Sufficient air for engine idle enters the cylinder head through a bypass passage 42. The valves, which are all linked together, are provided by a rotary spool inside a cylindrical bore which is integrally cast with the manifold. A valving portion 30 is associated with each tract.
