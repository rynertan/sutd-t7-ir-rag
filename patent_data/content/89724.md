In a cassette 20 for a camera, two filter wheels 21, 22 provided with filter elements 23A to 23E are provided. The filter wheel 21 is held between two guide wheels 25, 26 and a driving wheel 27 which is driven by a minielectric motor 28 . The wheel 22 is held in a similar manner between two guide wheels 29, 30 and a driving wheel 31 driven by a minielectric motor 32 . The guide wheels 25,29 are connected to a lever 33 . By lifting the lever 33 the filter wheels 21, 22 are released and can be taken out of the cassette 20 . Along the circumference of each filter wheel 21, 22 a code field 40 is provided for each filter element 23A to 23E , which code field is read by reading means 46, 48 . In this way each filter element 23A to 23E can be moved into the optical path of the camera. The electric connections terminate in a plug 39 which during insertion of the cassette 20 mates with a socket in a rear wall of the camera. The cassette 20 may furthermore be provided with a test slide projector for focusing the pick up tubes in a camera.
