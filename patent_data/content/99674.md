# Polymeric diacyl peroxides.

## Abstract
An industrially highly valuable novel polymeric diacyl peroxide which is used as a polymerization initiator for free radical polymerization of vinyl monomer, and which is appreciably safe in production and handling, rapidly soluble in vinyl monomer with high solubility, and has exceedingly high catalyst efficiency in the free radical polymerization of vinyl monomer.
