# Package label assembly.

## Abstract
A package label assembly comprises a label sheet 10 and two copy sheets 11, 12 adhesively connected along one edge. The copy sheets 11, 12 are provided with lines of weakening 11a, 12a so that these can be detached from the label sheet 10 and transfer material is provided to enable writing applied to the label sheet 10 to appear on the copy sheets 11, 12 . A translucent or transparent front sheet 14 is provided which has pressure sensitive bands 14a, 14b and the front sheet 14 is attached to the label sheet 10 by the band 14a adjacent same one edge of label sheet 10 . The front sheet 14 is wider than the label sheet 10 . Two strippable sheets 15, 16 are attached to the bands 14a, 14b . The sheet 15 lies on the side of the copy sheet 12 remote from the front sheet 14 and the sheet 16 lies between the label sheet 10 and the front sheet 14 . In use, the front sheet 14 can be turned back so as to write on the label sheet 10 . The strippable sheets 15, 16 may thus be removed so that the margins of the front sheet 14 can be adhesively connected to a package. The copy sheet 11, 12 can be removed as required.

## Claims
CLAIM 1. A package assembly comprising the combination of a label sheet and at least one copy sheet attached together adjacent one edge, the copy sheet having a line of weakening to enable it to be detached from the label sheet and transfer material being provided to enable writing applied to the label sheet to appear on the copy sheet, a transparent or translucent front sheet having pressure sensitive adhesive material thereon, said front sheet being attached to the label sheet by said pressure sensitive adhesive adjacent said one edge of the label sheet, a first strippable sheet strippably attached to the pressure sensitive adhesive and lying on the side of the copy sheet remote from the front sheet, and a second strippable sheet strippably attached to the pressure sensitive material and lying between the label sheet and the front sheet, said front sheet being wider than the label sheet in a direction parallel to said one edge.

## Description
PACKAGE LABEL ASSEMBLYThis invention relates to a package label assembly for use in labelling packages for despatch by mail or carrier or for other purposes.It has previously been proposed to enclose a label sheet and a copy sheet within an envelope, made by adhesively connecting front and back sheets together along three adjacent edges with the label sheet and the copy sheet projecting from one end of the envelope so that the label sheet, which is left behind when the copy sheet is removed, is protected within the envelope which is adhesively attached to the package. Such assemblies are expensive to manufacture because of the operations required to make up the envelope.It is an object of the invention to provide a package label assembly in a form which is cheaper to manufacture and easier to use than the known assemblies referred to above.A package label assembly in accordance with the invention comprises the combination of a label sheet and at least one copy sheet attached together adjacent one edge, the copy sheet having a line of weakening to enable it to be detached from the label sheet and transfer material being provided to enable writing applied to the label sheet to appear on the copy sheet, a transparent or translucent front sheet having pressure sensitive adhesive material thereon, said front sheet being attached to the label sheet by said pressure sensitive adhesive adjacent said one edge of the label sheet, a first strippable sheet strippably attached to the pressure sensitive adhesive and lying on the side of the copy sheet remote from the front sheet, and a second strippable sheet strippably attached to the pressure sensitive material and lying between the label sheet and the front sheet, said front sheet being wider than the label sheet in a direction parallel to said one edge.With such an arrangement, the front sheet can easily be turned by to allow the label to be written on and the two strippable sheets can then be stripped off the adhesive so that the margins of the front sheet can be adhesively connected directly to the package. The copy sheet or sheets can then be removed as required, leaving the label sheet attached to the package and protected by the front sheet.An example of the invention is shown in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a package label assembly,Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section on line 2 2 inFigure 1, andFigure 3 is an elevation of the package assembly after it has been attached to a package.In the example shown, the assembly includes a label sheet 10 and two copy sheets 11, 12, which are adhesively connected together along one edge to form a stub 13. The copy sheets 11, 12 are formed with transverse lines of weakening lla, 12a adjacent this stub so that they can be removed by tearing.It will be noted that sheet 12 is longer than sheet 11 which in turn is longer than sheet 10 measured in a direction perpendicular to said one edge so that the sheets 11, 12 are visible and can be grasped and removed selectively.A front sheet of transparent or translucent film 14 is provided and this has on one face two bands of pressure sensitive adhesive 14a, 14b. The front of the label sheet 10 is adhesively connected to the band l4a at the stub end and, as will be clearly seen in Figure 1, the sheet 14, being wider than sheets 10, 11 and 12 in a direction parallel to said one edge, overhangs the sheets 10, 11 and 12 along two marginal edge portions.The sheet 14 is so positioned relative to the sheet 10 that sheet 14 also overhangs beyond the stub, but terminates short of the opposite end of sheet 10.The two bands 14a, 14b, have strippable sheets 15, 16 attached to them, but these can be stripped off when required. Sheet 16 covers the whole of band 14b and lies between the sheets 10 and 14. Sheet 15 lies behind the copy sheets and is attached to the band l4a only in the overhanging portions thereof. To use the label assembly described, the front sheet 14 is turned back to allow the label sheet to be written on. Transfer material not shown causes the writing to appear in well known manner on the copy sheets. Next, the sheet 15 is removed and the assembly is attached to the packet by the overhanging portions of band 14a.Now, the sheet 16 is removed and this is pressed down onto the label sheet 10 and the package.The label sheet is now well protected by the front sheet and firmly secured to the package, but the sheets 10, 11 and 12 project and sheets 11 and 12 can be removed when required. The assembly may, of course, have many more than two copy sheets which can be removed separately as the labelled package goes through various stages of delivery, to enable a record of its passage to be kept at each stage.
