# Vehicle steering system.

## Abstract
A steering mechanism of a vehicle including a front wheel steering mechanism for steering front wheels of the vehicle, a steering wheel wheel for effecting a steering movement of the front wheel steering mechanism to a de sired angle, a rear wheel steering mechanism for steering rear wheels of the vehicle, a control unit for effecting a steering movement of the rear wheel steering mechanism in relation with the steering movement of the front wheels. The arrangement is such that a ratio of the steering angle of the rear wheel to the steering angle of the front wheel is increased in the same direction of steering as the steered direction of the front wheels as the rate of the steering op eration for the steering wheel is increased so as to obtain a desirable steering movement of the rear whels.
