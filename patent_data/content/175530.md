## Abstract
Seeds falling down a chute pass between two spaced win dows 38, 40 and two spaced mirrors 34, 36 facing each other across the width of the chute. A linear array of seven ra diation emitters CR1 CR7 direct a beam of radiation across the seed path through a slit aperture in the window 38 . The beam passes through a slit aperture in the window 40 to a pair of radiation detectors 46, 48 connected in parallel and provid ing a signal representing the amount of radiation falling there on. Because of the number of emitters CR1 CR7 in the linear array, the beam of radiation is diffuse and non collimated so that no seed can be in the shadow of another and the integrated reduction in radiation falling on the detectors 46, 48 accu rately represents the number of seeds passing through.
