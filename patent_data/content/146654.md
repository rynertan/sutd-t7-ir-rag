# Processes and apparatus for carrying out specific binding assays.

## Abstract
A process for carrying out a specific binding assay for example an immunoassay in which a a sample under assay, possibly containing a substance being tested for, is reacted with b a specific binding partner for the substance being tested for, immobilised on a solid support, and c a specific binding partner for the substance being tested for which is conjugated to a detectable marker, thereby to form a complex by reaction between whatever quantities are present of the substance being tested for with reagents b and c , in which the marker is immobilised to the support via the substance being tested for, and is detected or assayed as an index of the quantity present in the sample a of any of the substance being tested for characterised in that reaction ingredients a , b and c are all mixed in a single step for reaction in a single reaction liquid, and competitive interference between the binding reactions of the substance being tested for and reagents b and c is avoided either by use of an antibody of narrow and different, non interfering specificity, such as a monoclonal antibody, to avoid the interference, or by use of a slow release form of reagent c .
