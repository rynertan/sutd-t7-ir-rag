# HYDRAULIC APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for turning a steerable vehicle wheel in cludes a pump assembly which is connected with a reservoir through an inlet valve. Upon rotation of a steering wheel, the in let valve is actuated to allow fluid to flow from the reservoir to the pump assembly at a rate which varies as a function in varia tions in the speed of rotation in the steering wheel or the torque applied to the steering wheel. The output from the pump assembly is conducted to a directional control valve which is actuated upon initial rotation of the steering wheel to direct fluid flow to the power steering motor to effect turning movement of the steerable vehicle wheel in a desired direction. The rate at which the power steering motor turns the steerable wheel is determined by the extent to which the inlet valve is opened and is independent of the directional control valve.
