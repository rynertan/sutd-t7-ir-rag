## Description
This invention relates to polyhydroxyethers, known as phenoxy resins, and their modification by grafting thereon moieties containing pendant carboxylic acid half ester groups. Phenoxy resins, sometimes referred to herein as thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers, are known in the art as components of corrosion resistant coatings, e.g., zinc rich coatings for metallic substrates, as described in US A 4,370,382. Phenoxy based coatings of the prior art are not, however, entirely satisfactory in that their adhesion to smooth substrates, e.g., metallic substrates, is subject to degradation by corrosion, particularly in environments of high humidity. Carboxylic acids, particularly those with a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain, are known to have corrosion inhibitive properties for steel exposed to near neutral salt solutions. Salts of weak acids, such as benzoic acid, have been used as corrosive inhibitors in boiler compounds and antifreeze solutions. However, organic acids, when used in coatings, often tend to migrate to the steel interface and interfere with the adhesion of the coating resin. It would be very useful, therefore, if a way could be found to realize the beneficial corrosion inhibiting effects of a carboxylic acid containing coating, but without suffering the deleterious effects of the migration of the carboxylic acid. It is also very desirable if, at the same time, the adhesion of a phenoxy based coating could be improved, particularly under conditions of high ambient humidity. Likewise, it would be desirable to provide compositions which can be readily emulsified in water, for use where solvent free or minimum solvent systems are needed. The carboxylic acid half ester containing phenoxy resins of this invention can be used as general purpose and corrosion resistant coatings, and particularly for highly pigmented systems such as zinc rich and magnetic media coatings. These resins have improved dispersing properties for particulate materials, such as powders. They may be used in adhesives and laminating systems with improved wet adhesion, and particularly for polar and metallic substrates. The resins are also useful in water dispersible coatings, adhesives and laminating systems. All these commercially important objectives are met by the present invention. This invention provides a phenoxy resin having pendant secondary hydroxyl groups of which 3 to 50 of such hydroxyl groups have been reacted with an acid anhydride to produce moieties having pendant carboxylic acid half ester groups. Also provided is a method for producing such a phenoxy resins comprising In addition, this invention comprises a phenoxy coating composition comprising This invention further provides an aqueous emulsion comprising Also provided is a method for producing such an emulsion, comprising In addition, this invention provides a magnetic coating composition for magnetic recording media comprising and wherein the magnetic powder is present in the concentration range of 1 1 to 30 1, preferably 1.5 1 to 10 1 magnetic powder phenoxy resin. Finally, this invention provides an article comprising a substrate coated with the above coating compositions or emulsions. The carboxylic acid grafted phenoxy resins of this invention are achieved by reaction of monoanhydrides of di or polycarboxylic acids with a certain proportion, preferably 5 to 25 , of the secondary hydroxyl groups present on the resin s polymeric chain. In general, the polymer should have a molecular weight of about 15,000 to about 45,000, preferably about 22,000 to about 37,000, and ideally about 30,000. It is imperative that a monoester be formed and that diester formation be as close to nil as possible, since diester formation will result in a high viscosity or gel. The monoester reaction will predominate at controlled reaction temperatures and under the influence of catalysis, generally of the tertiary amine type. In addition, the phenoxy resin should contain little or no epoxide functionality, thereby avoiding any possible reaction with the carboxyl groups. The terms thermoplastic poly hydroxyether and phenoxy herein refer to substantially linear polymers having the general formula The thermoplastic poly hydroxyethers can be prepared by admixing from about 0.985 to about 1.015 moles of an epihalohydrin with one mole of a dihydric phenol together with from about 0.6 to 1.5 moles of an alkali metal hydroxide, such as, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, generally in an aqueous medium, at a temperature of about 10 to about 50 C until at least about 60 mole percent of the epihalohydrin has been consumed. The thermoplastic poly hydroxyethers thus produced have reduced viscosities of at least about 0.4. Reduced viscosity values are computed by use of the equation wherein t The dihydric phenol contributing the phenol radical residuum, D, can be either a dihydric mononuclear or a dihydric polynuclear phenol such as those having the general formula wherein Ar is an aromatic divalent hydrocarbon radical such as naphthylene and, preferably, phenylene, Y and Y₁ which can be the same or different are alkyl radicals, preferably having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen atoms, i.e., fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, or alkoxy radicals, preferably having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, r and z are integers having a value from 0 to a maximum value corresponding to the number of hydrogen atoms on the aromatic radical Ar which can be replaced by substituents and R¹ is a bond between adjacent carbon atoms as in dihydroxydiphenyl or is a divalent radical including, for example, and divalent hydrocarbon radicals such as alkylene, alkylidene, cycloaliphatic, e.g., cycloalkylidene, halogenated alkoxy or aryloxy substituted alkylene, alkylidene and cycloaliphatic radicals as well as alkarylene and aromatic radicals including halogenated, alkyl, alkoxy or aryloxy substituted aromatic radicals and a ring fused to an Ar group or R¹ can be polyalkoxy, or polysiloxy, or two or more alkylidene radicals separated by an aromatic ring, a tertiary amino group, an ether linkage, a carbonyl group or a sulfur containing group such as sulfoxide, and the like. Examples of specific dihydric polynuclear phenols include, among others The bis hydroxyphenyl alkanes such as Also suitable are the bisphenol reaction products of 4 vinylcyclohexene and phenols, e.g., 1,3 bis p hydroxyphenyl 1 ethylcyclohexane and the bis phenol reaction products of dipentene or its isomers and phenols such as 1,2 bis p hydroxyphenyl 1 methyl 4 isopropylcyclohexane as well as bisphenols such as 1,3,3 trimethyl 1 4 hydroxyphenyl 6 hydroxyindane, and 2,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 4 methylpentane, and the like. Particularly desirable dihydric polynuclear phenols have the formula wherein Y and Y₁ are as previously defined, r and z have values from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R¹ is a divalent, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, particularly alkylene and alkylidene radical, having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and cycloalkylene radical having up to and including 10 carbon atoms. Mixtures of dihydric phenols can also be employed and whenever the term dihydric phenol or dihydric polynuclear phenol is used herein, mixtures of these compounds are intended to be included. The epoxide contributing the hydroxyl containing radical residuum, E, can be a monoepoxide or diepoxide. By epoxide is meant a compound containing in oxirane group, i.e., oxygen bonded to two vicinal aliphatic carbon atoms, thus, A monoepoxide contains one such oxirane group and provides a radical residuum E containing a single hydroxyl group, a diepoxide contains two such oxirane groups and provides a radical residuum E containing two hydroxyl groups. Saturated epoxides, by which term is meant diepoxides free of ethylenic unsaturation, i.e., C C and acetylenic unsaturation, i.e., C C , are preferred. Particularly preferred are halogen substituted saturated monoepoxides, i.e., the epihalohydrins and saturated diepoxides which contain solely carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, especially those wherein the vicinal or adjacent carbon atoms form a part of an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Oxygen in such diepoxides can be, in addition to oxirane oxygen, ether oxygen O , oxacarbonyl oxygen Specific examples of monoepoxides include epichlorohydrins such as epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, 1,2 epoxy 1 methyl 3 chloropropane, Illustrative diepoxides include diethylene glycol bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate , and Q is a saturated hydrocarbon radical such as an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical. The preferred polyhydroxyether is available commercially as UCAR Phenoxy PKHH, a trade designation of Union Carbide Corporation for a condensation polymer derived from bisphenol A 2 2 bis p hydroxyphenyl propane and epichlorohydrin having the structural formula The phenoxy resin is available as a solution in glycol ether esters such as Cellosolve acetate the acetate of a monoalkyl glycol ether sold under the Trademark Cellosolve by Union Carbide Corporation or in pellet form which is readily soluble in a variety of solvents and solvent blends. The solid phenoxy resin sold under the designation PKHH by Union Carbide Corporation is soluble in the following solvents butyl Carbitol , butyl Carbitol acetate, butyl Cellosolve , Carbitol solvent, Cellosolve acetate, Cellosolve solvent, diacetone alcohol, diethyl Carbitol , dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, ethoxy triglycol, mesityl oxide, methyl Cellosolve acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran. Carbitol is a Trademark of Union Carbide Corporation for the monoalkyl ether of diethylene glycol. The preparation of the above described polyhydroxyethers is described in US A 3,305,528. In addition to these polyhydroxyethers one may also employ the linear thermoplastic polyethers described in US A 3,177,089, US A 3,306,872, and US A 2,602,075. Typical of the useful anhydrides are succinic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, alkenyl succinic anhydride, dodecenyl succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, dichloromaleic anhydride, chlorendic anhydride, linoleic acid adduct of maleic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, maleic anhydride adduct of methylcyclopentadiene, trimellitic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, nadic anhydride, and the like. Itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, tetrahydrophathalic anhydride, linoleic acid adduct of maleic anhydride, and the maleic anhydride adduct of methylcyclopentadiene, all having reactive double bonds capable of undergoing polymerization or copolymerization with other reactive, double bond containing materials when subject to heat, catalysis or radiation, produce coatings with improved solvent and temperature resistance. Of these, succinic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride are especially preferred. Trimellitic anhydride has the following structure Therefore, compared to succinic anhydride or other monoanhydrides, each ester graft with the phenoxy resins generates two pendant carboxylic acid groups rather than one. It allows one to make a more polar molecule and the aromatic ester linkage is less subject to hydrolysis than that of aliphatic esters. Suitable catalysts are Lewis bases or electron donors. An important class is tertiary amines. Examples of tertiary amines which may be used to catalyze the reaction of anhydrides with the secondary hydroxyl of a polyhydroxy ether to form a half ester acid are as follows linear diamines, of the formula CH₃ ₂N CH₂ Tertiary amines have an unshared pair of electrons in their outer orbital. They are attracted to areas of reduced electron density in the molecules with which they react. It is postulated without intending to be bound to any particular theory that an activated complex is formed, as shown with the following reaction of Dabco with succinic anhydride which is a quasi 6 membered zwitterion wherein complexation lowers the activation energy of the reaction The reaction between the phenoxy resin and the anhydride is preferably effected in a non reactive solvent, such as dimethyl Carbitol 2 methoxyethyl ether , 2 ethoxyethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, methylisobutyl ketone, methylethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, toluene, and the like. Of these, tetrahydrofuran is particularly preferred. In selecting a solvent, it is important to note that the solvent should not contain any reactive hydroxyl groups or hydrolyzable ester linkages. Alternatively, the phenoxy can be dispersed in a poor solvent, such as an alkylated aromatic, to a fine particle size. The anhydride should be soluble in the solvent to form a continuous phase which can react on the surface of the particle. An example would be methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride using benzyldimethylamine as catalyst. The preparation of a nonaqueous dispersion of 30,000 molecular weight polyhydroxyether, because of its high melt viscosity, would require a high shear mixer and the use of a high boiling solvent or a pressure vessel to prevent evaporation of the solvent. The desired reaction is illustrated by the reaction between Phenoxy PKHH and succinic anhydride The concentrations of the various materials may vary substantially, depending upon the materials and operating conditions selected. Optimization of the reaction would be a matter of routine experimentation within the skill of the art. In general, however, it may be expected that, on a weight percent basis, the concentration of the phenoxy resin would be about 98.9 to about 74.8, preferably about 97 to about 88 the concentration of the anhydride would be about 1 to about 25, preferably about 3 to about 12 and the concentration of the catalyst would be about 0.05 to about 0.5 . The reaction mixture should be well stirred, and the reaction should be carried out at a temperature of about 80 to about 145, preferably about 115 to about 135 C. These temperature ranges are recommended to obtain reasonable reaction rates without incurring gel problems. When temperatures as high as 145 C are used, viscosity increase will probably be noted, indicating some reaction between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. In conducting the reaction, only a minority of the available secondary hydroxyl groups is converted, in order to permit a later hydroxyl cross linking reaction and to minimize water sensitivity of the polymer. Only about 3 to about 50, preferably about 5 to about 25 of the available hydroxyls are reacted. Sufficient hydroxyl groups should be left in the phenoxy so the combination of hydroxyl and carboxy groups can co react or react with cross linkers, such as a variety of di or polyisocyanates or melamine formaldehyde. The percent conversion is controlled by selecting the number of mols of anhydride necessary to react with the hydroxyl groups on the phenoxy, and then carrying out the reaction until no anhydride groups remain. When unsaturated anhydrides, such as tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, are used, additional cross linking can take place via polymerization or copolymerization with other unsaturated materials by using heat, catalysis or radiation. The invention is illustrated in more detail in the following examples. All parts and percentages are by weight, based on the entire recipe. The viscosity of the succinic acid grafted phenoxy at the 25 solids content was identical to that of the Phenoxy PKHH resin solution 9 stokes 900 mm² s, at 20 C , indicating that the primary reaction was half ester carboxylic acid formation with little or no diester formation. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that tetrahydrofuran THF was used as the solvent instead of dimethyl Carbitol . The THF was dried over molecular sieves. Because of the relatively low boiling point of THF, the reaction was run at 64 C, which of course caused an increase in reaction time. The reaction again was tracked by taking periodic samples and analyzing them by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The results are shown in Table I. In this table, the Carbonyl Ratio column shows the ratio of carbonyl peak heights of bands assigned to anhydride and esters. It is apparent from these data that the reaction was virtually over within 3 hours when triethylene diamine is used as a catalyst. The reaction is much closer to completion in 10 minutes with the catalyst than after 5 1 2 hours without a catalyst. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that benzyldimethylamine was used as the catalyst instead of triethylenediamine. Again a satisfactory acid grafted phenoxy resin was obtained. The conversion was determined to be 96.5 . Because of the relatively low vapor pressure of trimellitic anhydride, the reaction was measured using differential titration with alcoholic and aqueous alkali It has been found that the anhydride grafted phenoxy resins of this invention can be easily made into excellent emulsions in water. In contrast, ungrafted phenoxy resins of the prior art, when emulsification is attempted, do not emulsify but coagulate. Example 5 presents a typical procedure for emulsification. One hundred g of a 25 solution of succinic anhydride grafted phenoxy in tetrahydrofuran or 2 methoxyethyl ether, heated to 60 C, were added to the following mixture with stirring one hundred g of a mixture of distilled water 78.72 , butyl Cellosolve 20.01 , and dimethylethanolamine 1.27 , heated to 60 C. A low viscosity, translucent emulsion was obtained with a pH of 6.9. Dimethylethanolamine, indicated above, was present in the water phase in sufficient concentration to form a soap with about 85 of the available carboxyl groups. The tetrahydrofuran was removed in a rotating flask Roto Vac under a vacuum of 91 kPa 27 inches of Hg using a 50 C hot water bath. This then results in a solvent free system. The emulsion so produced was film forming at room temperature in the presence of a small amount of filming agent, such as butyl Cellosolve , a fine powder film is obtained in the absence of a filming agent. Elevated temperature would then be required to flux the polymer particles. Similar excellent results were obtained when a trimellitic anhydride grafted phenoxy was used in the emulsion instead of the succinic anhydride product. The procedure of Example 5 was repeated, except that the butyl Cellosolve cosolvent was deleted from the mixture. Again, excellent translucent micro emulsions were obtained. In this case, however, the emulsions were not film forming at room temperature instead, they produced a fine powdery, non adhering coating. Phenoxy emulsions prepared by either succinic anhydride or trimellitic anhydride grafting were observed for stability at ambient temperature. Table II demonstrates that emulsion stability was good. Succinic anhydride grafted Phenoxy PKHH was prepared using sufficient succinic anhydride to react with varying percentages of the available hydroxyl groups in the molecule percent stoichiometry . The reactions were carried out in tetrahydrofuran and the resulting resins were precipitated in isopropanol to produce a powder which was recovered for molding. 0.635 mm 25 mil sheets were compression molded at 150 C and tested for physical properties, shown in Table III. Particular attention should be given to the elongation at break, and pendulum impact, which are a measure of toughness. It is observed that the phenoxy can be grafted up to about 20 40 of its hydroxyl stoichiometry without degrading its physical properties below the level of commercial acceptability. The physical properties of trimellitic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and tetrahydrophthalic anhydride grafts are shown in Table IV. In this case, the number of carboxylic acid groups generated by grafting is two times the number of hydroxyls involved in the reaction. The aromatic nature of the trimellitic anhydride stiffens the backbone of the phenoxy more than the pendant aliphatic anhydride. Table IV shows that the toughness properties are retained between 5 and 10 stoichiometry. Phthalic anhydride and tetrahydrophthalic anhydride were grafted at 20 stoichiometry only. Succinic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride grafted phenoxy resins were applied as coatings to cold rolled steel using the following procedure Cold rolled steel panels Q steel were cleaned with methyl ethyl ketone and dried in an oven at 60 C. A coating was applied using a wet film applicator having a 0.076 mm 3 mil gap. The coating was dried for 1 hour at 25 C. A second coat was applied on top of the first, and was dried similarly. The panels were then baked for 20 minutes at 100 C. The resulting panels had a dry film thickness of 0.023 mm 0.9 mil and were exposed to high humidity conditions and salt spray to test their resistance to corrosion. Testing was performed using ASTM D 2247 in a Cleveland Humidity apparatus Model No. QCT MDO, manufactured by Q Panel Co. of Cleveland, Ohio. Exposure conditions were 500 hours at 120 F 49 C . Results are reported in Table V. Table V shows that the succinic anhydride grafted phenoxy retains good cross hatch adhesion after 500 hours of Cleveland Humidity at 49 C 120 F . Ungrafted Phenoxy PKHH shows complete loss of adhesion under the same conditions. There is also an advantage in corrosion resistance shown by the grafted phenoxy a corrosion rating of 10 indicates no change, whereas a rating of 0 is complete failure . Salt spray resistance was evaluated using ASTM B 117. Cross hatch adhesion was tested using ASTM D 3359 83 Method B , with the variation that the rating was based on the percent of squares not removed, i.e., all removed 0 adhesion, none removed 100 adhesion. Curiously, salt spray test results did not show an improvement for the grafted resin over the ungrafted. Trimellitic anhydride grafted phenoxy resins were applied and tested in a similar manner. Table VI shows the results of Cleveland Humidity Tests. Significant adhesion degradation is seen for resins acid grafted with less than 5 of the hydroxyl stoichiometry. It was noted that the resins in the 20 40 graft range retained good adhesion in spite of the fact that they were white from water blush. Similarly to the results for salt spray of the succinic anhydride grafted phenoxy resins, the trimellitic anhydride grafted resins show no significant improvement in salt spray performance. From the practical standpoint, however, most coatings do not see salt spray conditions, but rather, high humidity which results in loss of adhesion and failure of the paint. Retention of adhesion under field conditions, which are better reflected by the non salt test, should provide improved coating longevity. It may also be desirable in some cases that the acid grafted phenoxy resins be used in coatings with a small amount of epoxy resin so that any carboxyl groups which cannot orient themselves to the steel, due to the rigidity of the polymer backbone, will be tied up and therefore not contribute to water sensitivity. Statistically, not all the carboxyl groups can interact with the surface. A very useful and surprising advantage of the grafted phenoxy resins of this invention is their beneficial reduction of the viscosity of iron oxide containing formulations. This effect should permit the formulation of higher solids iron oxide coatings, which should be useful in, e.g., the manufacture of magnetic media. This effect is illustrated in the following example Table VII shows the effect of trimellitic anhydride acid grafting on the rheology of iron oxide systems. The dispersions were made using a Cowles Dissolver, model no.1 V G, manufactured by Cowles Dissolver Co., of Cayoga, N.Y. The Dissolver was operated at 4,000 rpm. Substitution of the acid grafted phenoxy for conventional resin lowered the 20 rpm viscosity to 50 and the 2 rpm viscosity to 30 of the control. The viscosity ratio was also reduced. This therefore offers the advantage of being able to apply higher solids coatings at given viscosities.
