# Method and apparatus for preheating elastomer products.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to an improved method of preneating elastomer products such as a green tire and the like in a vulcanizing process, which is capable of uniformly preheating the elastomer product up to a required tempera ture in an efficient manner through simple steps including dielectric heatng by high frequency waves applied to the elastomer product from both its upper and side portions.
