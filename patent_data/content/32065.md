## Description
DESCRIPTION Flexible drive transmission cables and methods of providing such cables with plastics coverings . This invention relates to flexible drive transmission cables of the kind adapted for the transmission of longitudinal drives along tubular guides, comprising a flexible core carrying helically coiled wire the turns of which are spaced from one another and are adapted to be engaged in the manner of rack teeth by a driving pinion. flexible drive transmission cables of this kind are known. Examples of possible utilizations of such a cable are mentioned in U.S.A. Patent Specification 3,163,054 in connection with devices for raising and lowering automobile windows and for opening and closing autaix bile sliding roofs. With such utilizations it may be necessary, unless one supplies adequate lubricating agents to the tubular guide interior, to exert relatively large forces in order to overcome rubbing friction between the cable and the guide tube moreover, the shaking of the autamnbile may give rise to an objectionable noise of rattling of the cable in the tubular guide. With a view to reducing such rubbing friction and noise, U.S.A. PatentSpecification 3, 845, 669 proposes to provide in addition to the cable a separate sheath of lon friction plastics material interposed between the cable and the tubular guide.Such sheath is formed with an open gap extending along its length through which gap at the position of the pinion the pinion teeth project in order to engage the turns of the helically coiled wire of the cable. A flexible cable adapted for the transmission of longitudinal drives along tubular guides, comprising a flexible core carrying helically coiled wire the turns of which are spaced from one another and are adapted to be engaged in the manner of rack teeth by a driving pinion, is characterized according to the present invention in that the cable carries plastics material in the form of a continuous covering extending over both the helically coiled wire and the core of the cable and which is relatively thick and relatively thin where it extends respectively over the crowns of the turns of the helically coiled wire and over the core surfaces between the said turns. The invention therefore provides a unitary plasticsprotected cable of inherently low rubbing friction when used in an appropriate tubular guide and which does not present metal to metal contact with the tubular guide that might promote rattling. On the wire turn crowns which contact or can contact the tubular guide wall the plastics covering is relatively thick and therefore it is adapted for the witstanding of wear. However, since between the wire turns the plastics material covering the cable is relatively thin the driving pinion can have driving teeth long enough to exert effective driving engagement with the plastics covered wire turns in spite of the presence of the plastics covering over the crowns of the turns. BBoreo er, also by reason of the relative thinness of the covering on the cable core itself, the flexibility of the cable is relatively little impaired by the covering. A method of providing with its continuous covering a flexible cable as specified in the last foregoing paragraph but one by advancing the cable through a machine adapted for the extruding through an annular extruding orifice of a continuous sleeve surrounding the cable leaving the machine of covering material in heated, plastic condition is characterized according to the present invention by maintaining such a relation between cable speed and covering material extrusion speed that the cable being covered draws out the sleeve of heated, plastic material leaving the annular orifice of the machine and continuously maintaining between the exterior and the interior of the draMi out length of the sleeve of heated, plastic material a pneumatic pressure difference urging the heated, plastic material towards the cable and sufficient to stretch the said material, where it extends between the wire turns, into a covering to the core surfaces between the wire turns which is thinner than is the cohering material on the crowns of the wire turns. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a length of flexible drive transaission cable engaged rack wise by a drive pinion, the left portion of the cable is shown without a plastics covering and the right portion of the cable is shown carrying such a covering Figure 2 is representation on a larger scale and in section on the line Il Il of Figure 1 of part of the covered portion of the cable shown in Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a sectional side elevation of a crosshead extrusion die apparatus in use for providing with its plastics covering a flexible drive transmission cable as shown in Figures 1 and 2. With reference to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, a flexible plastics covered drive transmission cable 1 adapted to be engaged in the manner of a rack by a drive pinion 11 comprises a flexible core 2 which is made up of a plurality of wire strands 3 wound helically anti clockwise and which carries, wound helically clockwise around the core, a coil of wire 4 of considerably greater diameter than the diameters of the wire strands 3, the turns 5 of the wire 4 are spaced from one another and are adapted to be engaged by the drive pinion 11 in the manner of rack teeth. The cable 1 carries plastics material in the form of a continuous covering 10 extending both over the wire 4 and over the core 2. The covering is substantially thicker over the crowns 6 of the wire turns 5 than it is over the core surfaces 7 between the wire turns 5 preferably it is at least twice as thick over the crowns 6 as it is over the core surfaces 7. The cable is adapted to be disposed within an appropriately dimensioned tubular guide not shown for the transmission of longitudinal movements, effected by rotating the drive pinion, to a location which may be more or less remote from the location of the drive pinion.The cable is flexible whereby the movements may be transmitted along the tubular guide in spite of any necessity there may be that the said guide shall lie in somewhat curved configurations in its path between the drive pinion and the point of use of the longitudinal movements. One example of an envisaged point of use of a longitudinal movement of the drive transmission cable would be a bracket attached in the most suitable place to an automobile window for effecting the raising and lowering thereof, which raising and lowering could be effected by a crank on the shaft of the drive pinion, which crank would preferably be located in the most suitable position for manual operation by an occupant of the automobile. the The plastics material of vering 10 is preferably one of the types of nylon or a material of similar character. With reference to Figure 3, a machine for covering the cable includes a cross head extrusion die apparatus 20 having an inlet 21 through which heated, plastic nylon 22 is supplied under pressure by conventional means not shown to flow through an annular passage 24 around a tapering pilot mandrel 23 to an annular extruding orifice 25. A bore 27 extends through the apparatus along the mandrel axis along which bore the cable 1 comprising core 2 and the wire 4 is moved by suitable means not shown to leave the apparatus centrally of the annular extruding orifice 25, which is radially spaced from the bore 27 and the cable 1 leaving the bore.The heated, plastic nylon leaves the orifice 25 as a sleeve surrounding the cable and the cable speed and the nylon extrusion speed are chosen such that the said sleeve is drawn out between the orifice 25 and the already nylon covered part of the advancing cable 1 and may thus tend towards the shape of a hollow frusto cone.Between the exterior and interior of the drawn out length of plastic nylon sleeve a pneumatic pressure difference is imposed by virtue of applying through a pipe 29 from a suitable device not shown a partial vacuum to the bore 27. A rubber diaphragm device 28 itraugh which the cable 1 is caused to pass before it enters the bore 27 is provided to form a seal to militate against the breaking of the said partial vacuum. The partial vacuum has the effect of enabling external atmDspheric pressure to urge the heated plastic nylon towards the cable and, wherever the sleeve of plastic nylon has a part spinning the space between the crowns of two adjacent turns of the wire 4, to stretch that part of the sleeve as it approaches the core 2 so that the said sleeve part becomes of smaller thickness. The result is the covering of the cable with a nylon covering of the characteristic features described with reference to Figures 1 and 2. It will be understood that the covered cable may be run through a water cooling trough not shown if desirable or necessary. A cross head extrusion die apparatus as described with reference to Figure 3 has been used to apply TypeNo. 6 nylon to a cable to form a covering having a thickness of 0.009 inch 0.23 mm at the wire crowns 6 and a thickness of 0.003 inch 0.075 inn in the spaces between the wire turns. The diameter of the extruding orifice 25 was 0.560 inch 14.2 inn , the outer diameter of the tip of the mandrel 23 was 0.450 inch 11.4 inn and the diameter of the bore 27 was 0.320 inch 8.1 inn . The die apparatus was heated to a temperature of 490 R 2540C while a partial vacuum of 20 inch Ag 50.8 cm lig was exerted through the pipe 29. The cable being covered was removed from the machine at a speed of 50 feet per minute 1524 cm per minute . The nylon pressure was applied by a screw conveyor operating at 10 revolutions per minute. It should be borne in mind that the actual relative and absolute thicknesses of the plastic covering at the wire crowns 6 and over the core surfaces between the wire turns will depend on many operating and dimensional factors, amongst which may be mentioned by way of example the sealing effectiveness of the diaphragm 28, the revolutions per minute of the screw conveyor, the plastic temperature and the length of the passage 24.
