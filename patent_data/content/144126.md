# Semi conductive heating cable.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved semi conductive heating cable having semi conductive material surrounded by a jacket that is imparted with improved resistance to color change upon exposure to elevated temperatures and is able to minimize changes in the ambient electrical resistivity of the semi conductive composition arising from exposure of the cable to elevated temperatures by reason of the jacket being made from a radiation crosslinked composition comprising a mixture of at least one elastomer with at least one polyolefin and at least one heat stabilizer wherein the preferred elastomer comprises either or both a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and at least one diene or an ethylene propylene rubber and the polyolefin is a polypropylene polymer.
