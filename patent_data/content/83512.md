# INK JET APPARATUS

## Abstract
An ink jet array comprises a plurality of elongated transdu cers 204 couplied to a plurality of ink jet chambers 200 . The transducers 204 are supported at longitudinal extremeties only so as to minimise cross talk between jets within the array. The support 228 at the extremity remote from the chamber 200 is provided such that no longitudinal motion along the axis of elongation of the transducers 204 occurs. The support at the other extremity includes bearings 207 precluding substantially lateral movement transverse to the axis of elongation but permit ting longitudinal movement along the axis of elongation.
