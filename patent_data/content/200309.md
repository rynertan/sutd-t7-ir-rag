# Gas insulation metal clad power equipment.

## Abstract
The cylindrical insulating bushing of an insulating gas metal clad power equipment for supporting a loaded con ductor 6 is air tightly fixed to a grounded compartment wall member 4, 60 in such a way that the outer surface of the conductor directly faces the inner circumferential surface of a through hole 41 formed in the wall member with a distance g therebetween without any intervening portion of the bushing. When the axial length ℓ of the inner cylindrical space of the bushing is determined as ℓ g 4 and further the difference in diameter between the wall through hole ₁ and the inner cylindrical space ₂ of the bushing is determined as ₂ ₁ 4mm, it is possible to effectively prevent dielectric breakdown along the surface of the bushing. Owing to the above arrangement, it is possible to effectively reduce the size, space, weight, cost, etc. of the bushing, that is, equipment, as compared with the conventional one.
