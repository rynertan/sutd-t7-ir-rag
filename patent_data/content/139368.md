# Terminal crimping apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for automatically crimping terminals 14 to electric wires 12 by a cooperation between a pressing punch 6 driven through a press ram 5 and a stationary anvil 7 . The apparatus has a crimp height adjusting mechanism which includes a tapered spacer 21 movable perpendicularly to the press ram, a stopper member 22 having a complementary tapered surface and slidably placed on the tapered spacer so as to be able to move only vertically as the tapered spacer is moved. The stopper member 22 has an upper surface adapted to be contacted by a portion 5 of the press ram thereby determining the stroke end of the press ram 5 . The tapered spacer 21 is slidingly moved in a controlled manner by an electric motor 19 , so that the heightwise position of the stopper member 22 is changed to allow a delicate adjustment of the lower stroke end of the press ram 5 . In consequence, the crimp height is automatic ally adjusted minutely in accordance with the diameter of the electric wire to be processed.
