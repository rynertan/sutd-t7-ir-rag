## Description
PROCESS FOR SEPARATING ESTERS OF FATTY ACIDS BY DEGREE OF UNSATURATION The field to which this invention pertains is the separation of fatty acid esters by degree of unsaturation.More specifically the invention relates to a continuous process for separating esters of more unsaturated fatty acids from esters of less unsaturated fatty acids in 2 mixture comprisingh the to types of esters by contacting said mixture with a solid zeolite adsorbent which nas a higher affinity for more unsaturated fatty acid esters and then desorbing the adsorbed esters from the adsorbent. It is often important to separate fatty materials such as fatty acid esters into fractions of different degrees of unsaturation since there are specific uses for fatty materials having, respectively, higher or lower degrees of unsaturation. This is especially true in the manufacture of drying oils for coatings, the manufacture of resins and plasticizers, the compounding of cosmetic products and in the manufacture of chemical derivatives. For such purposes, a fatty acid ester product becomes more valuable as the proportion of the desired i.e., more unsaturated or less unsaturated components is increased in the product. The zeolites used as the adsorbents herein have a preferential affinity for the more unsaturated components of a fatty acid ester mixture, i.e., the higher the degree of unsaturation, the higher the affinity. Accordingly, in the process of the invention, the fraction of the fatty acid ester feedstock which is adosrbed on the zeolite becomes enriched in the more unsaturated components, while the fraction which remains unadsorbed becomes enriched in the less unsaturated components. The use of zeolite adsorbents also called molecular sieves to separate olefinic hydrocarbons from paraffinic hydrocarbons is well known. For example, U.S. Patents 3,265,750 issued August 9, 1966, to Peck et al., and 3,510,423, issuedMay 5, 1970, to Neuzil et al., describe the use of X and Y zeolites to conduct such separations. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It is the broad object of the invention to provide a continuous process for separating more unsaturated fatty acid esters from less unsaturated fatty acid esters in a mixture comprising fatty acid esters of different degrees of unsaturation.In a more specific sense it is an object of the invention to provide a continuous process for conducting the above separation utilizing zeolite molecular sieves as adsorbents for selectively adsorbing the more unsaturated esters from a mixture comprising more unsaturated and less unsaturated esters, and utilizing a safe and effective desorbent solvent system for desorbing the adsorbed esters from the adsorbent. In its broadest aspect, the present invention comprises a continuous process for separating an ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid from a mixture comprising an ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid and an ester of a less unsaturated fatty acid, which process comprises the steps of a contacting said mixture in the fluid state, with a solid adsorbent, thereby selectively adsorbing said ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid b removing from the adsorbent a raffinate stream enriched relative to the composition of the original mixture in said ester of a less saturated fatty acid c contacting said adsorbent with a fluid desorbent material to effect desorption of said ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid from said solid adsorbent and d removing from said solid adsorhent an extract stream enriched relative to the composition of the original mixture in said ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid wherein waid adsorbent comprises an X or Y zeolite containing at cation exchangeable sites at least one cation selected from the group consisting of metals of Group IA of the Periodic Table ofElements, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, silver, gold, zinc, nickel, copper, cadmium and mercury and combinations thereof wherein said fluid desorbent material consists essentially of a mixture of one or more paraffinic hydrocarbons containing from about 5 to about 12 carbon atoms, and one or more ethers having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl groups containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, n is 4 or 5, y is 1 or 2 and the sum of n and y is 5 or 6, wherein the volume ratio of paraffinic hydrocarbon to ether is from about 9 1 to 1 9, and wherein contact between solid adsorbent and fluids in said process is effected by means of continuous countercurrent flow fluid solid contact A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a continuous simulated moving bed process for the separation of an ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid from a mixture comprising an ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid and an ester of a less unsaturated fatty acid, which process comprises the steps of a introducing a feed strew of said ure into a first zone in an absorption column, which column effects overall fluid flow under substantially isothernal liquid phase conditions from a fourth zone through intervening serially connected third and second zones to a first zone, which column contains at least four serially connected fixed beds of an adsorbent, and adsorbing in said first zone at least a portion of said esters of said more unsaturated and less unsaturated fatty acids within the pores of said adsorbent b in said second zone, located i7rumediately upstream of said first zone, contacting said adsorbent, containing said esters of said more unsaturated and less unsaturated fatty acids within the Fores of said adsorbent, with a fluid desorbent material to effect displacement of said ester of a less unsatu rated fatty acid from within the pores of said adsorbent c at the upstream boundary of said second zone, simultaneously withdrawing an extruct stream comprising at least a portion of said ester of a ore unsaturated fatty acid which has been previously desorbed in said third zone ismedi ately upstream of said second zone d simultaneously introducing into said third zone, a desorbent material stream to effect said desorption e at the upstream boundary of said fourth zone located immediately upstream of said third zone and in open fluid communication with sand first and said third zones, simultaneously wslthdrawing a relatively less selectively adsorbed raffinate stream comprising at least a portion of said ester of a less unsaturated fatty acid and f periodically and simultaneously advancing the points of introduction of said feed stream and said desorbent material, and the points of withdrawal of said extract stream and said raffinate stream, one bed length in a donçnstream direction wherein in said process the adsorbent comprises anX or a Y zeolite containing at exchangeable cationic sites at least one cation selected from the group consisting of cations of metals of Group IA of thePeriodic Table of Elements, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, silver, gold, zinc, nickel, copper, cadmium and mercury, and combinations thereof, and therein said desorbent material consists essentially of a mixture of one or more paraffinic hydrocarbons containing from about 5 to about 12 carbon atoms,and one or more ethers having the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl groups containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, n is 4 or 5, y is 1 or 2 and the sum of n and y is 5 or 6, and wherein the volume ratio of paraffinic hydrocarbon to ether is from about 1 9 to 9 1. The present process can be used to separate unsatureated fatty acid esters from each other according to their degree of unsaturation e.g., monounsaturate from diunsaturate . It can also be used to separate an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid from a mixture comprising an ester on unsaturated fatty acid and an ester of a saturated fatty acid, in which case the ester of the saturated fatty acid is considered to be an ester of a less unsaturated fatty acid. For example, the process can be used to separate methyl oleate, methyl linoleate or methyl linolenate or all three, from methyl stearate, or methyl pafimi tate or both. Likewise, the process can be used to separate, for example, methyl oleate from methyl linoleate or methyl linolenate or both. The use of X and Y zeolites to effect separations between more and less unsaturated fatty acid esters is described in the copending application of Logan, Ser. No. 846,300, filed Cote 25, 19 7, and incorporated by reference herein. The present invention is directed specifically to the carrying out of such separations in a continuous manner utilizing countercurrcnt flow fluid solid contact. The Feedstock The fatty acid esters which comprise the feedstock which is to be separated according to the present process are reaction products of a fatty acid and a saturated lower Cl c4 alkyl alcohol. Generally, the alcohol is a monohydric short chain alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol.From a co.mmercial standpoint the methyl esters are especially important and for purposes of simplicity the present process will be described primarily with reference to methyl esters, although it should be kept in mind that other lower alkyl esters of fatty acids can also be separated by the process The fatty acids from which the esters are made comprise a large group of monocarboxylic aliphatic acids which can be saturated i.e., no double bonds or unsatuated i.e., containing one or more double bonds Thy most common of these acids contain from about 6 to about 22 catbon atoms in the aliphatic chain and 0, 1, 2 or 3 sites of double bond unsaturation.Thus, an ester containing no double bonds in the fatty acid moiety is the least unsaturated, and one containing 3 double bonds in the fatty acid moiety is the most unsaturated.The present process includes the separation of an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid, from an ester of a saturated fatty acid, in which case, of course, the ester of the saturated fatty acid is considered to be the ester of a less unsaturated fatty acid, and the ester of the unsaturated fatty acid is considered to be the ester of a more unsaturated fatty acid. Examples of individual estcrs are methyl stearate, methyl caprate, methyl laurate, methyl palpitate, methyl lauroleate, methyl myristoleate, methyl oleate, methyl cicosanate, methyl linoleate, methyl linolenate, methyl eleostearate and methyl claidate. ethyl esters of fatty acids are normally produced commercially by methanolysis of naturally occurring glycerides, rather than by reaction with fatty acids per se. The fatty chains within these glycerides vary within the sane glyceride molecule, as well as between glyceride molecules, in chain length and in degree of unsaturation thus the methyl esters so produced are also mixtures.For example, typical mixtures of methyl esters obtained from the methanolysis, respectively, of soybean oil and beef tallow, have the following compositions TABLE I Corposition of Fatty Methyl Esters by weight From Soybean Oil From TallowSaturates Myristate or lower Tr. 0.5 2 8 Palpitate 7 11 24 37 Stearate 2 6 14 29 Bicosanate or higher 0.3 3 Tr. 1.2Unsaturates Palmitoleate or lower Tr. l 2.3 3.3 Oleate 15 33 40 50 Linoleate 43 56 1 5 Linolenate 5 11 The fatty acid esters used as feedstock in the present process generally contain from 7 to about 26 carbon atoms per molecule. In most cases, feed mixtures which are charged to the present process then will be those comprising an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid and an ester of a saturated fatty acid, with the object of the process being to separate the mixture into saturates and unsaturates. Preferred as feedstocs for the present process are methyl esters of such fatty acids. The feed mixtures will typically contain one or more unsaturated fatty acid esters, which may be monoethenoid, diethenoid, triethenoid, etc., or mixtures thereof, and one or more saturated fatty acid esters.An example of a feed mixture is one containing 1 wt. C14 and lower saturated compounds 28 wt. methyl palmitate 19 wt. a methyl stearate 42 wt. methyl oleate 9 wt. e methyl linoleate and 1 methyl linolenate and higher saturates and unsaturates. Except for the small amount of 014 and lower material and the small amount of linolenate and higher saturate and unsaturate naterial, such feed mixture consists essentially of C16 and C18 methyl esters of fatty acids and more speoifically consists of two saturated fatty acid esters, one monoethenoid unsaturated fatty acid ester and one diethenoid unsaturated fatty acid ester. From a commercial standpoint, the esters which are most important for use in the present separation process are the esters particularly methyl esters of C14 and 020 fatty acids having 0, 1, 2 and 3 double bonds in the fatty acid chains. Feed mixtures which can be charged to the present process may contain, in addition to fatty acid esters, a diluent material, that is not adsorbed by the adsorbent and which is preferably separable from the fatty acid esters which are separated by the process, e.g., by distillation.Paraffinic hydrocarbons are examples of suitable diluents.Normal hexane, 2,2,4 trimethyl pentane and normal octane are specific examples of paraffinic hydrocarbons that can be used as diluents, and can easily be distilled from the fatty acid esters. When a diluent is employed the concentration of diluent in the mixture of diluent and fatty acid esters will generally be from about 2 to about 90t by weight, with the remainder being fatty acid esters. The Adsorbents The adsorbents which are used in the process of the present invention are the crystalline aluminosilicates designated as X and Y zeolites. They are also referred to in the art asX and Y molecular sieves. These materials are well kno n and have been described, respectivelt, in U.S. Patents 2,so2,244, Milton, issued April 14, 1959, and 3,130,007, Break, issuedApril 21, 1964, both incorporated herein by reference. Zeolite X has the formula EMI11.1 wherein M represents a metal cation, n is its valence and x may be any value up to 8, depending on the identity of the metal and the degree of hydration of the crystal. Zeolite Y has the formula EMI11.2 wherein M represents a metal cation, n is its valence, w is a value greater than 3 up to about 6 and x may be a value up to about 9, depending on the identity of r, and the degree of hydration of the crystal. The position of 01 in the zeolite crystalline structure is normally referred to as an e cchangeable cationic site. Zeolites X and Y are normally produced and sold in the sodium form, i.e., M . in the above formulas is sodium.If it is desired to substitute other mental ions for sodium at the exchangeable cationic sites, this can be accomplished by conventional cation exchange techniques, e.g., treating the sodium sieve with an aqueous solution of a salt of the desired cation. The X and Y zeolites for use in the process of the present invention can have any of the following metals at the exchangeable cationic sites the metals of Group IA of the Periodic Table of Elements e.g., lithiun or sodium 1 magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, silver, gold, zinc, copper, cadmium, mercury and nickel, or combinations thereof. The Group IA metals, especially sodium, are preferred. The zeolites, as produced and sold commercially, normally contain, in addition to the actual zeolite, an inert diluent such as clay. Typical commercial material contains about 20 by weight clay and about o0t by weight zeolite. The zeolites are available commercially from The Linde Company, Tonawanda, New York. It is generally preferred that the zeolite adsorbent used in the process herein have a water content of 0 to about 10 by weight of the zeolite. A given moisture level can be achieved by heating the zeolite in an oven to constant weight to drive off all water, and then rehydrating the zeolite with the desired amount of water. The adsorbent used in the present process can have a particle size range of from about 20 to about 80 mesh Standard U.S. Mesh and trill preferably have a particle size within the range of about 20 to fi0 mesh. The X and Y zeolites herein have a high affinity for the double bonds in the unsaturated esters, therefore, the feed material, upon contact with the zeolite, becomes separated into a raffinate, enriched in the less unsaturated components, and in of e of scparation obtained can be determined by analysis of th ra t inatc and extract streams, using standard gas liquid chromatographic tcchniques. If further enrichment of either stream. desired beyond that which can be obtained ore run through the process, the respective streams can be recycled as feed streams to the process.Thus, for example, one run of a feedstock through the process can be used to separate saturates from unsaturates, and then the etract stream, substantially free of saturates, can be passed through the process again to separate the unsaturated esters from each other by degree of unsaturation. The ability of an adsorbent to preferentially adsorb curve material over another in a mixture of materials in contact with the adsorbent can be expressed as relative selectivity. Th relative selectivity can be expressed not only for one feed component as compared to another but can also be expressed between an feed mixture component and the desorbent material.The selectivity, B , as used throughout this specification is defined as the ratio of the two components of the adsorbed phase over the ratio of the same two components in the unadsorbed phase at equilibrium conditions. The mathematical expression of relative selectivity is shown in the following equation Concentration M Concentration N n Selectivity B Concentration 01 Concentration Niu where M and N are to components of the feed represented in volume or weight percent and the subscripts A and U represent the adsorbed and unadsorbed phases respectively. The equilibrium conditions are determined when the feed in contact with the adsorbent does not change composition with additional time in contact with the adsorbent.In other lords, there is no net transfer of material occurring between the unadsorbed and adsorbed phases. There the selectivity B between tnn caponents is 1.0 there is no preferential adsorption of one component by the adsorbent with respect to the other. A selectivity B of less than or greater than 1.0 indicates there is a preferential adsorption of the adsorbent for one component with respect to the other. A relative selectivity B of larger than 1.0 for one component M over another component N, indicates that M is preferentially adsorbed, thus the extract phase on the adsorbent is enriched in M, and the raffinate phase i.e., the unadsorbed phase is enriched in N. The higher the relative selectivity of an adsorbent for an extract component over a raffinate component, the easier the separation is to perform. Generally, B values of 2 or greater for an extract component over a raffinate component are preferred. A dynamic liquid chromatography testing apparatus is employed to determine the selectivity of the zeolite adsorbent far fatty acid esters of different degrees of unsaturation in t presence of a desorbent, and thereby predict the ability of the system to perform in a continuous countercurrent flow fluid solid contact process. The apparatus consists of an adsorbent column of 120 cm length and 7 mm inside diameter, having inlet and outlet ports at opposite ends of the column.The column is in a temperature controlled environment. A constant flow pup is used to pump the desorbent feed mixture through the column at a predetermined flow rate.Quantitative and qualitative analytical equipment such as refractive index or U v. detectors can be attached to the outlet port of the column and used to detect the components as they chute from the column. A dynamic test, performed using thr above apparatus and the following general procedure, is used to determine selectivities and any other needed data for various adsorbent desorbent combinations. The adsorbenL is allowed to come to equilibrium with a particular desorbent material by passing the desorbent through the adsorbent column for a given period of time.As the desorbent is passing through the column, and at a convenient time, a pulse of feed containing a knnn amount of a tracer, and in a compatible rredium e.g., paraffinic hydrocarbon diluent , is injected, via a sample loop, into the system. The desorbent flow is essentially undisturbed during this operation.The pulse of feed plus tracer is allowed to flow through the column and separate into individual components as these components core into contact with the adsorbent, and in turn are desorbed by the desorbent. The effluent can be analyzed on stream or samples can be collected periodically and analyzed separately by analytical equipment. Graphs of tie components can be plotted to show when and where they eluted off the column.The operation of such a dynamic test is illustrated inExample I of this specification. From information derived from the test adsorbent, pcrfonrance can be rated in terms of void volume of the adsorbent, retention volume for an extract or a raffinate component, selectivity for one component with respect to the other, and the rate of desorption of an retract component by the desorbent. The retention volume of an extract or a raffinate component may be characterized by the distance between the peak of the elution curve of an extract or a raffinate component and the peak of the elution curve for the tracer component or alternatively some other known reference point i.e., from time 0 .It is expressed in terms of the volume in cubic centimeters of desorbent pumped during this time interval represented by the distance between the peaks. Selectivity, B , for an extract component with respect to a raffinate component may be characterized by the ratio of the distance between the extract component peak and the tracer peak or other reference point to the corresponding distance between the peak of the raffinate component and the peak of the tracer. The rate of exchange of an extract component with the desorbent can generally be characterized by the width of the peak envelopes at half intensity. The narrower the peak width the faster the desorption rate. The desorption rate can also be characterized by the distance between the tracer peak and the disappearance of an extract component which has just been desorbed.This distance is again the volume of desorbent pumped during this time interval. The D sorbent The selection of a proper desorbent solvent is essential to the effective operation of a continuous countercurrent flow fluid solid contacting process as employed in the present invention and described in more detail below.By contrast, when X or Y zeolites herein are used as adsorbents in a batch type process for separating saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters, the choice of solvent for desorbing the adsorbed ester from the adsorbent is not especially critical. In such process, after the feed has been brought into contact with the adsorbent, the raffinate enriched in the less unsaturated ester can be drawn off and the adsorbent can tnen be contacted with a solvent to desorb the extract enriched in the more unsaturated ester from the aisorbent. Generally, any solvent which is capable of dissolving the fatty acid esters and is compatible with the esters can be used as the desorbent in such a process.Preferably, it should be one which can be used in reasonably small quantities to desorb the adsorbed esters and will have a boiling point such that it can be separated from the esters by distillation. Examples of some of the solvents which can be used are ketones, such as acetone, crs sch as diethyl ether or diisopropyl ether, amides such aS dimethyl formamide, olefins such as l hexene or l octene, esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or methyl propionate, and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. Saturated hydrocarbons, although good solvents for fatty acid esters, are not good desorbents when used alone since large quantities are needed to desorb the fatty acid esters from the zeolite adsorbent.The saturated hydrocarbons can be combined with various of the solvents described above to produce effective desorbent systems. With respect to a continuous countercurrent flow fluidsolid contacting process as employed herein, particularly one utilizing a simulated moving bed technique, the desorbent which is a solvent or mixture of solvents must be one which does not unduly affect the selectivity of the adsorbent for the more unsaturated fatty acid esters over the less unsaturated fatty acid esters, since both types of esters and the desorbent are all simultaneously in contact with the adsorbent. The desorbent must also, of course, be chemically compatible with the esters and should have a boiling point which renders it easily separable from the esters by distillation. It should also be a material which is industrially suitable from the standpoint of cost, availability and industrial hygiene. It has been found that a solvent system meeting these criteria for being a suitable desorbent material for the process of the invention is a mixture of a paraffinic hydrocarbon and an ether. Suitable paraffinic hydrocarbons are those which contain from about 5 to about 12, preferably from about 5 to about 8 carbon atoms. They can be cyclic or acyclic, straight chain or branch chain. Preferably they are acyclic and straight chain. Mixtures of paraffinic nydLocarboDs can be used. Examples of suitable paraffinic hydrocarbons are isopentane, n hexane, n octanc, 2 methyl octane, cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane. Suitable ethers are those having the forla R1 0 R2 wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl groups containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, and those having the formulaEMI19.1 wherein n is 4 or 5, y is 1 or 2 and the sum of n and y is 5 or 6. The R groups can be cyclic, or acyclic, straight chain or branched chain. The dialkyl ethers can be symmetrical or unsyretrical, but are preferably syrmetrical. The cyclic ethers can be 5 or 6 member rings, containing 1 or 2 oxygen atoms in the ring. Mixtures of ethers can be used. Examples of suitable ethers are ethyl propyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethyl butyl ether, dihexyl ether, ethyl cyclohexyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 1,3 dioxane and 1,4 dioxane. The volume ratio of paraffinic hydrocarbon to ether in the desorbent should be from about 1 9 to about 9 1, preferably from about 2 1 to about 1 2, and most preferably about 1 1. Preferred desorbent solvent systems are those consisting essentially of diisopropyl ether and n hexane. Process Description Continuous countercurrent flow fluid solid contacting processes for selective adsorption and or removal of components from a feed stream by selective adsorption are well known in the art and the present process can be practiced by utilizing the hereindescribed feed mixtures, adsorbent and desorbent, in the apparatus and process steps of such processes.

Lines 7 through 14 enter the column 6 through ports that are located between the eight individual fixed beds in a preferably narrow portion of the column 6. For example, line 12 enters the column 6 through port 22 between beds 5 and 6 . Flow distributor 5 can comprise a rulti valve manifold arrangement, a rotary multiport valve or any other suitable flow directing mechanism that will, in a programed manner, direct flow of the feed line 2 and desorbent line 4 streams into the column and the raffinate line 1 and extract line 3 streams out of the column. As shown in the attached figure, the feed flows through line 2 to flow distributor 5 wherein the feed is sent through line 9 to column 6 the desorbent flows through line 4 to the flow distribu r iich sends the desorbent through line 13 to the column the raffinate stream flows from column 6 through line 7 to the flow distributor wherein the raffinate stream is sent through line 1 to fractionation facilities .25 the extract stream flows from the colunn through line 11 to the flow distributor which sends the extract stream through line 3 to fractionation facilities 26. The streams flowing into and out of the process as described above comprise a single cycle Cycle 1 of Table II of an operation which will vary in length of time according to the feed composition, required product purity, adsorbent properties, etc. Determination of the appropriate cycle time length for the particular result desired is well within the skill of the art. Table II below indicates the locations of the feed, raffinate, extract and desorbent streams during the individual cycles used in the continuous operation of. column F TABLF II FLOW DISTRIBUTOR PROGRAMED OPERATION Lines through which material is flowing see attached figure Cycle 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 l R F E D 2 F E D R 3 F E D R 4 E D R F 5 E D R 6 D R F E 7 D R F E 8 R F E D Raffinate stream D Desorbent stream E Extract stream F Feed Stream. Cycle 8 is the last cycle in completing one sequence of operations. After cycle S is completed, cycle 1 is started. As can be seen in Table II, the raffinate, feed, extract and desorbent streams that flow to column 6 are advanced equally in the same direction when advancing to the next cycle of operations. It should be understood four or more cycles may be used and that the number of cycles required for one complete sequence of operations depends on the number of individual inlet outlet ports that the column contains. As can be seen in Table II, there are only four of the total of eight lines entering the column 6 that are in use during a given cycle. For example, in cycle 1 of Table I, lines 7, 9, 11 and 13 are in use while lines 8, 10, 12 and 14 are not in use. The flow distributor 5 is constructed in a manner so that the lines not having material flowing through them during a given cycle, i.e. lines 8, 10, 12 and 14 of cycle 1, are plugged or blocked off at either or both the flow director or column cnds, thereby stopping flow through these lines.In this manner of selected flow in and out of column 6 in predetermined cycles, a simulated countercurrent moving bed operation is effected in column 6. The adsorption column 6 of the attached figure is a plurality of serially connected fixed beds having more adsorbing affinity for UE s than for corresponding SE s. The beds can be in individual serially connected columns, or can be stacked in a single column as shown in the attached figure. The term column therefore, is used in the broadest sense in the present specification and claims to include a single column containing a plurality of fixed beds of adsorbent or a series of serially connected individual columns, each containing one or more fixed beds of adsorbent.Column 6 contains eight fixed beds nlered 1 through 8 with the terminal beds beds 2 and 3 oOrected by lines 15 and 16. Pusp 17 in line 16 provides a means for circulating liquid from the top of column 6 to the bottom thereof. The puprow .d system gives the fluid in column 6 a unidirectional flow which, relative to the stationary solid adsorbent, in the eight beds of colun 6, flows from bed 3 to bed 2 via beds 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 1 .Relative to bed 3 , bed 4 is in a downstream direction relative to bed 4 , bed 3 is in an upstream direction by virtue of the direction of fluid flowing through the separate beds. To reduce the operation of the adsorption column to relatively simplified terms, the column can be thought to be operating in continuous counterflow of liquid and said adsorbent with the overall separation of Ue s and SE s being effected by four separate zones. Zone I is the series of bcds located between the port of feed introduction downstream to the port of raffinate withdrawal zone II is the series of beds located between the port of extract withdrawal downstream to the port of feed introduction zone III is the series of beds located between the port of desorbent introduction to the port of extract withdrawal and zone . is the series of beds located between the port of raffinate withdrawal downstream to the port of desorbent introduction. As mentioned previously, the ports of feed and desorbent introduction and the ports of raffinate and extract withdrawal are advanced equally and essentially simultaneously in a downstream direction TableI .Consequently, zones I, II, III and IV are advanced equally and simultaneously in a downstream direction as the inlet and outlet ports are so advanced. Table III shows the location of the individual zones throughout the series of beds in the adsorption column for the individual cycles used in the continuous operation of the adsorption column TABLE III ZONE POSITIONS IN THE ADSORPTION COLUMN FOR VARIOUS CYCLES OF OPERATION Cycle . . . . . . . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Adsorbent bed in column 1 . . . . . . .

In zone I,UE s in the feed are adsorbed by the solid adsorbent displacing the previously adsorbed desorbent. During the normal course of operation zone I is shifted as previously described. In using zone I as a reference point, when zone I shifts to the next bed position Table III the solids that leave zone I enter zone II. The adsorbent that is entering zoneII carries UE s adsorbed from the feed and SE s from the feed.In zone II the SE s from the feed are displaced from the solid by desorbent and L s. Any LE from the feed that is desorbed from the adsorbent in zone II is readsorbed in zone I. The adsorbent in zone III carries UE s from the feed and some desorbent and is contacted with a large excess of desorbent which displaces all of the UE s from the feed that were carried on the adsorbent. tThen zone III shifts to its new location in the adsorption column the adsorbent that leaves this zone carries primarily desorbent which can be made available for reuse in zone III by contacting the adsorbent with a portion of the raffinate. In zone IV the displacing of desorbent by raffinate material is accomplished. The raffinate flow rate into zone IV is controlled so that the raffinate material flowing into zone IV is completely adsorbed. In starting the process, a feed stock comprising UE and SE mixture is charged into the process flow through line 2, at a rate controlled by valve 19, through flow director 5 and into line 9 which carries the feed into the column at the port located at the preferably narrow portion of the column located between beds 1 and 8 . The feed entering the column through the port of line 9 flows in a downstream direction into bed 1 wherein the UE s in the feed and some SE s are adsorbed by the solid adsorbent. Simultaneously, the desorbent present in the solid adsorbent pores from a previous cycle of operation is displaced from the adsorbent.The less strongly adsorbed SE s occupy the void spaces between the solid particles of the adsorbent and eventually flow downstream towards bed 2 and to line 7 which allows a portion of the raffinate stream SE s and desorbent mixture to be withdrawn from the column via line 7, the flow distributor 5 and line 1. The solid adsorbent n bed 1 contains, in addition to adsorbcd UE s, a nsiderable quantity of SE s which can be displaced from the ads ent by desorbent which, from a prior cycle, is contained in upstream beds 7 and 8 . The SE s which are displaced from the solid adsorbent in bed 1 by desorbent material flow in a downstream direction towards bed 2 .Unavoidably, some of the UE s adsorbed on the solid adscrbent in bed 1 are displaced at the same time. The flow rate of liquid flowing into bed 1 from bed 8 can be adjusted to displace substantially all of the SE s adsorbed by the adsorbent in beds i and 2 , without simultaneously lt7ashing out all of the more tenaciously adsorbedUE s Any UE s which are desorbed in bed 1 are readsorbed in bed 2 . The SE material, together with desorbent material, are the principal materials withdrawn from bed 1 , passing by the port of line 8 and entering bed 2 wherein any UE s in the material entering bed 2 can be adsorbed. The stream passing out of bed 2 through line 15 comprises principally the non adsorbedSE s and desorbent. A portion of the fluid effluent from bed 2 in line 15 passes through line 7 to flow distributor 5 and through the raffinate line 1 the raffinate flow rate out of the column is controlled by valve 18 in line 1. The remaining portion of effluent from bed 2 flows through line 16 into bed 3 . Line 16 connects the terminal beds 2 and 3 and allo s continuous unidirectional flow of liquid through the column. The solid adsorbent in beds 3 and 4 contains within its pores essentially only adsorbed desorbent which is present from a previous cycle of operation. The raffinate material flowing through line 16 to bed 3 comprises primarily SE s bich are adsorbed on the adsorbent in bed 3 displacing desorbent material downstream to bed 4 and bed 5 . The flow rate of the raffinate material into bed 3 is adjusted so that SE s are completely adsorbed on the adsorbent before reaching the outlet of bed 4 .Otherwise, the SE s would contaminate the UE product in the extract stream. The solid adsorbent in beds 5 and 6 contains adsorbedUE s and desorbent from a previous cycle of operations. The adsorbed UE s, which have been selectively adsorbed from the fred, are displaced by desorbent material flowing through line 4, at a rate controlled by valve 21, to the flow distributor, through line 13 and out of the port of line 13 between beds 4 and 5 The desorbent upon entering the column flows in a downstream direction into beds 5 and 6 displacing the U product.The desorbent and UE material which comprises the extract stream flows out of column 6 at the port between beds 6 and 7 through line 11 to the flow distributor 5 and through line 3 at a rate controlled by valve 20 in line 3. A portion of the extract material flows past the port of line 11 into the next downstream bed 7 Any UE product passing into bed 7 is adsorbed by the solid adsorbent in bed 7 . The desorbent material flowing through bed 7 into bed 8 tends to flush any adsorbed SE s that are carried within the solid when the feed line is shifted to line 8 cycle 2 . Generally, the SE portion of the raffinate stream not withdrawn from column 6 through the raffinate withdrawal line does not contaminate the stream of liquid flowing beyond the first downstream bed from the port of raffinate withdrawal.The same conditions apply for the U of the extract stream. The above described flow of feed and desorbent streams into the colur Lri and cxtract and raffinate streams out of the column comprise cycle 1 of Table II cycle 2 of Table I, is tllen executed with the feed line switching from line 9 to 8, the raffinate line switching from line 7 to 14, the desorbent line switching fro line 13 to 12, and the extract line switching fro . line 11 to 10. The lines are advanced in the direction of net liquid flow through the column in the valves 18, 19, 20 and 21 altering the input and output flow rates to achieve desired extract and raffinate purities. Lines 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 carry different streams to and from the adsorption column during the individual cycles of operation of the flow distributor. To eliminate the contamination of raffinate and extract streams it is understood that a method of flushing the lines 7 and 14 is preferred. A preferred method of flushing the lines 7 through 14 is to pump desorbent material through the line immediately upstream of the feed inlet into the adsorption column as described in U. S.Patent 3,201,491, Stine et al., issued August 17, 1965, incorporated herein by reference. In flushing the line immediately upstream from the feed line, the extract which eventually will be flowing out of the desorption column through a previously flushed line will not be contaminated with the feed stock components not desired in the extract. This increases product extract purity and favorably affects the quality of the extract material. process Conditions The continuous process of the present invention is generally carried out with the feed, desorbent, extract and raffinate streams all being in the liquid state at temperatures within the range of from about 25 C to 3000C preferably from about 500C to 1500C and pressures within the range of from about atmospheric to 500 psig. With respect to the simulated moving bed embodiments of the process, it is preferred that the process be carrier under substantially isothermal conditions, moaning that difference in temperature through the entire series of adsorbent beds is less than about 10 C. Differences in pressure at various locations throughout the series of adsorbent beds provide the means of allowing liquid flow into, out of and through the series of adsorbent beds. Preferably, these differences in pressure should be less than about 50 psi., but can be as high as 200 psi. EXk PLE I This example, employing a dynamic test procedure, shows the determination of selectivities for more unsaturated fatty acid esters with respect to less unsaturated fatty acid esters which are obtained by utilizing the combination of adsorbent and desorbent of the present invention, thereby making possible the continuous separation process of the present invention. The adsorbent used in this representativt example is Linde 13X molecular sieve. Linde Company, Tonawanda,New York This is a sodium X sieve consisting essentially of about 80g by weight zeolite molecular sieve and 20e by weight clay.The adsorbent used in the test was prepared by grinding the as purchased adsorbent material and then screening to approximately 20 40 U.S. mesh particle size range. The adsorbent was then dried at 6000C for approximately 16 hours, then allowed to cool under vacuum to room temperature before use. The room temperature adsorbent was treated with water to bring the water content to 5 by weight of the zeolite. The feed mixture used was a mixture of methyl esters of fatty acids having the position shown inTable IV. TABLE IV Experimental Feed Mixture Used Composition by , ,y Wt. C14 and Lower Saturates and Unsaturates 1.0C16 Saturated Methyl Palmitate 28.0C18 Saturated Methyl Stearate 19.0C18 1 One Double Bond Methyl Oleate 42.0 2 C18 Two Double Bonds Methyl Linoleate 9.0 C183 and Higher Saturates and Unsaturates 1.0 100.0 Composition determined by gas liquid cliromatography. One dynamic test equipment and the central procedure have been previously described in this spccification. The adsorbent was packed in a 120 cm x 7 rn inside diameter column maintained at 500C with a 50e by volume hexane, 50 by volume diisopropyl ether mixture as desorbent. The column was first allowed to come to equilibrium with the desorbent at a flow rate of 2.0 mls per minute. A 1.0 ml portion of a solution prepared by diluting 24 grams of the above Table IV esters, and 2.4 cr of octacosane used as a tracer material to establish the void volume of the column , to 100 ml in hexane, was then injected into the upstream end of the column.The ester was allowed to migrate through the column at a 2.0 ml per minute flow rate. Fractions of the hexane diiscpropy l ether desorbent were collected at the downstream end of the column every 2.5 minutes over a period of 40 minutes starting at 5 minutes after injection and ending with the fraction taken at 40 minutes. The collected fractions were analyzed for ester and octacosane tracer content by GLC. The GLC results were plotted or graph par versus time at which the fraction was collected. The plot showed the void volume of the column as indicated by the position of the tracer curve and the order in which the esters eluted. The retention volumes for the methyl esters were calculated by measuring the volumes from time zero instant of injection to the respective peaks of the methyl ester curves.Selectivities of each methyl ester were obtained by measuring the difference in retention volume from the peak of each methyl ester curve to the peak of the tracer curve, and by then dividing each of these differences by the retention volume difference of the C16 saturated methyl ester. Therefore, by definition, the selectivity of C16 saturated methyl ester becomes 1.0. Results are shown in Table V. TABT E V Selectivity of Na 13X Zeolite Adt orbent for Unsaturated and Saturated Methyl Esters of Fatty Acid Relative RetentionTest Material Volume Difference Selectivity C16 11 1.0 C18 8 0.7 C181 40 3.6 In this test the C18 diunsaturated ester methyl linoleate did not elute from the column within 40 minutes at the 2 ml per minute flow rate, since the affinity of the adsorbent for methyl linoleate is higher than that for methyl oleate. To determine the selectivity of the adsorbent for methyl linoleate relative to the C16 saturated ester methyl palmitate the test was repeated with a flow rate cf 5 ml per minute.In this second test the relative retention volume difference between methyl palmitate and the tracer was found to be 4 and between methyl linoleate and the tracer was found to be 53. Therefore, the selectivity of the adsorbent for methyl linoleate over methyl palmitate is 53 4 or 13.3. These results frown the dynamic test illustrate the ability of sodium X zeolite adsorbent to preferentially adsorb more unsaturated fatty acid esters over less unsaturated fatty acid esters in the presence of a hexane diisopropyl ether desorbent, thereby making a continuous process possible. Effective separations can also be obtained in a similar manner when the molecular sieve is sodium Y instead of sodium X. Likewise, separations can be obtained n the sodium ions have been exchanged for lithiun, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, gold, nickel, zinc, cadmium, silver or mercury. Likewise, effective separation can be obtained when n hexane in the desorbent is replaced by isopentane, n octane, 2 methyl octane, cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane, and when diisopropyl ether is replaced by ethyl propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethyl butyl ether, dihexyl ether, ethyl cyclohexyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 1,3 dioxane or l,4 dioxane.
