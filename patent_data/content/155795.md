# Collating apparatus with adjustable gear.

## Abstract
The invention relates to collating apparatus having a collating unit, a perforating unit and a fan folding unit, all gear driven by a single main drive gear and having a gear assembly driven by the drive gear. The gear assembly includes a gear 36 having an adjustable rotation eccentric ity and an adjustable phase of eccentricity relative to the other gears. The adjustable gear 36 includes an inner hub 72 mounted on a rotatable shaft 42 , an intermediate hub 86 having an eccentric bore 90 rotatably receiving the inner hub, a gear ring 94 having an eccentric bore rotatably receiving the intermediate hub and a clamp bar assembly 100 attached to the gear ring and to the shaft. The clamp bar assembly includes an adjustment mechanism 106, 108, 110, 112, 114 for varying the orientation of the gear ring, intermediate hub and inner hub relative to each other. By adjusting the rotational eccentricity of the gear ring and the phase of the eccentricity, the adjustable gear can compen sate for eccentricities inherent in other gears of the appar atus so that the collating, perforating and folding units operate synchronously.
