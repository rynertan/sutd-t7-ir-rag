# Propulsion system.

## Abstract
An aircraft propulsion system includes a gas turbine engine 12 driving a pair of counter rotating bladed mem bers 16, 18 through a planetary gear set 28 , and a brake 42 for simultaneously retarding rotation of both bladed members after engine shut down. The brake includes a pair of concentric transfer shafts 48, 62 each rotatably connected to separate elements 32, 26 of the planetary gear set, a pair of friction plates 74, 80 supported on respective ones of the transfer shafts for rota tion therewith, a plurality of non rotatable reaction mem bers 86, 96 between the friction plates, and a single actua tor 100 selectively operable to compress the stack of fric tion plates and reaction members to simultaneously retard rotation of both transfer shafts and thereby simultaneously retard rotation of, and eventually simultaneously stop, both of the counter rotating bladed members.
