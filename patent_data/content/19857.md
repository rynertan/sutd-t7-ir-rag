# Apoglucose oxidase preparation and its production.

## Abstract
An apoglucose oxidase preparation having a residual glucose oxidase activity of less than 0.05 , and preferably less than 0.005 . The preparation is obtained by incubation of glucose oxidase in aqueous solution at a pH of less than about 2 and in the presence of about 20 to about 40, preferably about 30, percent by volume glycerol, and separating resulting dissociated prosthetic group, flavin adenine dinucleotide, from apoglucose oxidase by column chromatography, preferably on cross linked dextran gel. The purified apoglucose oxidase is useful as a reagent in specific binding assays employing flavin adenine dinucleotide as a label.
