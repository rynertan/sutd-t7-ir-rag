## Abstract
Solid hydroxylammonium sulfate is reacted with an alcohol solution of an alkali metal hydroxide or alkoxide to produce an alcoholic hydroxylamine liquid phase and a sulfate containing solid phase. The liquid phase is used for further reactions such as oximations and hydroxamic acid production, or for the production of other hydroxylammo nium salts such as the nitrate, perchlorate, formate or oxalate. The different bases behave differently with regard to suitable and preferable solvents and temperatures.

## Description
DESCRIPTION PREPARATION FROM HYDROXYLAMMONIUM SULFATE OF ALCOHOLIC HYDROXYLAMINE SOLUTIONS AND OF OXIMES, HYDROXAMIC ACIDS AND OTHER HYDROXYLAMMONIUM SALTS VIA ALCOHOLIC HYDROXYLAMINE SOLUTIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydroxylamine, usually in the form of salts such as hydroxylammonium sulfate, hydroxylammonium chloride or the like is widely used as a reagent for preparing various industrial, specialty and pharmaceutical chemicals. Many products containing oxime or substituted hydroxylamine groups are not susceptible to production in aqueous media. Accordingly, such materials are normally prepared by reaction of solutions of hydroxylammonium chloride in organic solvents such as methanol with the organic precursor in the presence of sufficient base to neutralize the by product HC1. Because hydroxylammonium sulfate also called hydroxylamine sulfate is not soluble in methanol, however, the.cheaper sulfate reagent cannot be used to prepare these materials. Many other hydroxylammonium salts are more difficult to prepare than the sulfate made by theRaschig process and therefore would disirably be made from the sulfate. Proposals to do so in an ion exchange, exclusion or extraction column process are contained in U.S. Patents 4,166,842 to Tunick et al., 4,147,623 to Koff et al and 4,202,765 to Koff et al. Hydroxylammonium salts of organic acids are made inU.S. Patent 2,483,252 to Tryon 1949 by reaction of hydroxylammonium sulfate or chloride with ammonium or alkali metal salts of such acid, added as such or made in situ, with the reaction temperature usually 40 700C. see col. 2, lines 1 37 . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A process has been discovered which enables solid hydroxylammonium sulfate to be used to provide hydroxylamine values in alcoholic solutions and to produce oximes, hydroxamic acids and other hydroxylammonium salts therefrom. Accordingly, the present invention in its first form includes a process comprising the steps a reacting an alcoholic solution of a base selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and the corresponding alkoxides of 1 5 carbons with solid hydroxylammonium sulfate, employing an alcohol of 1 3 carbons, a temperature, a pressure and a time sufficient to produce a liquid phase having at least 50 of the hydroxylamine values of the hydroxylammonium sulfate, and b separating the solid phase comprising a sulfate salt corresponding to said base from the liquid phase. In the simplest form, this process produces an alcoholic solution of free hydroxylamine with little or no water content depending upon the base used and a by product solid phase containing sulfate salts.Depending, however, upon how much base is used, the alcoholic solution produced may be more or less basic than free hydroxylamine. Furthermore, the alcoholic solution may be converted to various salts, including hydroxylammonium chloride and hydroxylammonium nitrate, preferably after separation of the solid phase, and may also be reacted with an organic substrate to produce an oxime or substituted hydroxlyamine or hydroxamic acid product before or after separating the solid phase. In a second form of the invention, the above steps a and b are thus combined with c reacting the liquid phase with an acid other than sulfuric acid to produce an hydroxylammonium salt other than hydroxylammonium sulfate. For preparing hydroxylammonium salts of organic acids, however, the present invention also comprises in a third form a process comprising the steps a reacting an alcoholic solution of a base or basic organic salt selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, the corresponding alkoxides of 1 5 carbons and the corresponding organic salts with solid hydroxylammonium sulfate and, in the case of base, an organic acid, in the substantial absence of added water or water introduced with the alcohol employing an alcohol of 1 3 carbons, a temperature not greater than about 30 C, a pressure and a time sufficient to produce a liquid phase having at least 50 of the hydroxylamine values of the hydroxylammonium sulfate and a solid alkali metal or ammonium sulfate corresponding to the base or basic salt and b separating the solid phase comprising sulE salt from a liquid phase containing an organic hydroxylammonium salt corresponding to said basic organic salt or organic acid, said liquid phase being substantially free of sulfate. A fourth form of the process comprises the steps a reacting an alcoholic solution of a base selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and the corresponding alkoxides of 1 5 carbns with solid hydroxylammonium sulfate, employing an alcohol of 1 3 carbons, a substantial absence of added water, a temperature not greater than about 300C, a pressure and a time said alcohol, temperature, pressure and time being sufficient to produce a liquid phase having at least 50 of the hydroxylamine values of the hydroxylammonium sulfate, b reacting the hydroxylamine values in the liquid phase with an organic reagent selected from the group consisting of aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides and esters to form the corresponding product selected from the group consisting of aldoximes, ketoximes, and hydroxamic acids, c separating the solid phase comprising a sulfate salt corresponding to said base from the liquid phase containing hydroxylamine values or containing said corresponding product and d recovering from the liquid phase said product substantially free of water and sulfate impurities. In the simplest form, the first step of the process produces an alcoholic solution of free hydroxylamine with little or no water content depending upon the base used and a by product solid phase containing sulfate salts. The organic reagent may be added in this fourth form before, during or after the reaction of step a and, if after step a , then before or after the sulfate salt is removed in step c . The separating step c may be conducted before, during or after the react in step b . The reaction of step b will not occur rapidly during step a even if the organic reagent present because the conditions for rapid oximation pH 5 8 and temperatures over 250C are not present during step a . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The materials used in the process of the present invention are a base, an alcohol solvent and hydroxylammonium sulfate. Depending upon the form and product, other materials may be an aldehyde, a ketone, an ester, an acid chloride or an acid corresponding to the desired product salt. The hydroxylammonium sulfate is normally in solid form, preferably divided up into relatively fine powder or crystals, and may be produced in a variety of processes including, especially, that described in U.S. Patent 4,349,520 of Bonfield et al. September 14, 1982 . The alcohol may be any alkanol of 1 3 carbons, and especially methanol or ethanol, but also isopropanol and propanol when the base is an alkoxide. The base may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or an alkoxide. Suitable alkoxides are those of 1 4 carbons such as methoxides, ethoxides, isopropoxides, propoxides and butoxides of sodium, potassium or lithium. It is contemplated, however, that for any particular base, not all alcohols are suitable. Furthermore, for any particular base, specified conditions of temperature and or pressure may be necessary to achieve the desired conversion of at least about 50g of the hydroxylamine values from the solid hydroxylammonium sulfate to the liquid phase. The other acid may be any organic or inorganic acid other than sulfuric acid. In the case of sodium hydroxide as base, any of the alcohols indicated above may be used as solvent. The preferred solvent for use with sodium hydroxide is methanol, with ethanol being slightly less preferred. It has been found that for both methanol and ethanol as solvent, the process of the present invention proceeds to higher conversions at lower temperatures. Thus the reaction temperature, while it may be as high as about 300C, is preferably no greater than about 200C and more preferably no greater than about 100C. ComparativeExample 3, below, illustrates the significantly lower yields obtained at 35 400C compared to those obtained at 22 250C e.g., Example 2 and at 5 100C e.g., Example 1 .The concentration of sodium hydroxide in methanol or ethanol is not critical, but it is preferred to operate as near to the solubility limit of sodium hydroxide in the alcoholic solvent as possible without creating so viscous a solution that agitation becomes difficult. Larger amounts of the solvent may also be used if tolerable in subsequent reactions. Various of the examples illustrate the use of relatively concentrated methanolic and ethanolic solutions of sodium hydroxide in the present process. The amount of sodium hydroxide should be at least that required to neutralize 50 of the hydroxylammonium sulfate reacted, preferably at least that necessary to neutralize all of the hydroxylammonium sulfate.It is contemplated that greater amounts of sodium hydroxide than that stoichiometrically required may be used and, as indicated in Example 9 below, such excess sodium hydroxide may increase the reaction rate without detracting from reaction yields. Excess sodium hydroxide is normally to be used, however, only if the product alcoholic solution is to be used as a reagent in processes where more base would normally be charged at a later time. In other cases, the excess base can be neutralized before the solution is used further. Thus, the product solution can be formed at any desired pH such as from 5 to 12. In using sodium hydroxide in ethanol as the solvent, lower temperatures are still preferred, with reaction below about 300C, preferably below about 200C and more preferably no greater than about 100C being contemplated. It appears, however, that the reaction in ethanol is less temperature dependent than the reaction in methanol see Examples 11 and 12 below . Potassium hydroxide behaves quite differently from sodium hydroxide in the process of the present invention. First, methanol is not a suitable solvent for use with potassium hydroxide. As indicated inComparative Examples 15 and 16 below, reaction of potassium hydroxide in methanol with hydroxylammonium sulfate produces extremely low yields either at 100C or at 22 25 C. As indicated in Examples 17 and 18 below, however, potassium hydroxide in ethanol is a highly effective means of conducting the present process.These examples demonstrate that the reaction of potassium hydroxide in ethanol with hydroxylammonium sulfate proceeds at a slightly greater rate and to a slightly greater conversion at 22 250C than at 5 100C.Accordingly, any temperature not greater than about 400C preferably not greater than 300C may be used with potassium hydroxide as the base, with temperatures of about 15 to about 250C being preferred. Temperatures above 400C should not normally be employed, however, since the product free hydroxylamine is likely to decompose significantly faster at such temperatures. As in the case of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide may be used at any concentration and in any amount relative to the hydroxylammonium sulfate charged. Again, however, it is preferred in many cases to use a saturated or nearly saturated solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol rather than a dilute solution.It is also preferred to use, relative to the stoichiometric amount of potassium hydroxide, at least that needed to neutralize 50 of the hydroxylammonium sulfate, preferably at least that necessary to neutralize all of the hydroxylammonium sulfate. Excesses of potassium hydroxide may also be used. Lithium hydroxide, as a base in the present invention, may be used with methanol or ethanol. The reaction appears to proceed to slightly higher conversions at higher temperatures, as indicated by Examples 13 and 14 below. Nevertheless, any temperature up to about 400C may be used, with a range of about 10 to about 400C being preferred, and a range of about 15 to about 250 being more preferred. The reaction of lithium hydroxide in methanol appears to proceed at a slower rate and or to a lower final conversion than either the reaction of sodium hydroxide in methanol or ethanol or the reaction of potassium hydroxide in ethanol. The above comments relating to concentration of base in the alcohol and to amounts of base relative to hydroxylammonium sulfate made in respect to sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide apply equally to lithium hydroxide. While isopropanol or propanol may be used as solvents with NaOH, KOH or LiOH, the limited solubilities of these hydroxides and of the product hydroxyl amine in these solvents makes these embodiments less preferred to those described above. Ammonium hydroxide, as a base, may be used with any of the lower alcohols in a manner similar to that employed with lithium hydroxide. The term ammonium hydroxide is intended to include ammonia plus some amount of water, such as equimolar amounts of ammonia and water, or half or twice the equimolar amount of water. Using ammonia without any water is not considered satisfactory, based on the poor yields shown in comparative Examples 20 24, below. In using sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, pressure is not a critical factor since neither the base nor the solvent is very volatile.Only when ammonia is used, is pressure at all a factor, and even then atmospheric or even pressures below atmospheric may be used, but pressures at or above atmospheric pressure are preferred, and atmospheric pressure is more preferred. Alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, ethoxide, isopropoxide, propoxide, butoxide and pentylate may be used in place of the hydroxides, having the advantage of not producing water as by product. Therefore, when a substantially water free hydroxylamine solution is desired, these more expensive alkoxide bases should be used. Normally, the solvent will correspond to the anion e.g., sodium methoxide in methanol , but mixed systems e.g., sodium butoxide in methanol may be used if the solvent later present after the hydroxylamineconsuming reaction is not to be recovered and recycled or can be distilled. While the anion may be larger than three carbons, the solvent is normally a 1 3 carbon alkanol and is preferably methanol or ethanol because free hydroxylamine is more soluble in these lower alkanols. If the product hydroxylammonium salt is organic e.g. the acetate and the anion is present initially e.g. by reacting sodium acetate , then the solubility of free hydroxylamine becomes less critical and higher alcohol solvents, e.g. isopropanol or npropanol, become more suitable. In similar fashion, the alkoxides of lithium and potassium may be used, except that potassium alkoxides would normally not be used with methanol as solvent. Alkoxides are more expensive than hydroxides and are, therefore, normally not used unless the 3 or so water in the product solution of the above reactions of hydroxides cannot be tolerated for a particular use.The present invention, using alkoxides, still makes available the use of cheaper hydroxylammonium sulfate for such water sensitive uses. In the third form of the invention, basic organic salts corresponding to the desired hydroxylammonium salts e.g., sodium acetate to make hydroxylammonium acetate may be used instead of base. In each case, one preferred mode of conducting t e reaction is to first dissolve or slurry the base in the alcohol and then react the alcoholic solution wit hydroxylammonium sulfate. As illustrated by Examples 1 and 8, below, essentially identical results can be achieved either by adding the solid hydroxylammonium sulfate to the alcoholic solution or by adding th alcoholic base to the solid hydroxylammonium sulfate.Furthermore, it is contemplated that the two may be mixed in any conventional batch or continuous process scheme normally used to react a solid with a liquid. less preferred method of conducting the present invention is to mix the base solid or gas with the hydroxylammonium sulfate first, and then to add the alcohol. This scheme is less preferred because the process of dissolving the base in the alcohol which is required before the reaction can occur is normally an exothermic reaction. Since high temperatures are generally not required and in the case of sodium hydroxide are preferably avoided , it is desirable that the act of dissolving base in alcohol be conducted first, that the alcoholic solution be cooled and that the cooled alcoholic solution be reacted with the hydroxylammonium sulfate. Another less preferred method is to add the base slowly to hydroxylammonium sulfate slurried in alcohol. In the second form of the invention, once the reaction between alcoholic base and hydroxylammonium sulfate is complete, or while it is proceeding, the alcoholic solution containing hydroxylamine values is further reacted with either a mineral acid inorganic acid or an organic acid. In one mode, this reaction is conducted after separating the by product sulfate e.g., sodium sulfate from the alcoholic hydroxylamine solution. Thus, as illustrated in certain Examples below, the separated hydroxylamine containing liquid phase is reacted with acids such as HCl, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, formic acid or benzoic acid to produce the corresponding hydroxylammonium salt e.g., hydroxylammonium chloride, hydroxylammonium nitrate, dihydroxylammonium oxalate or trihydroxylammonium phosphate .In addition to these acids exemplifie9, ne can use, for example, arsenic acid, fluoboric acid, propionic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulf acid. In general, because of the ease of reacting alcoholic hydroxylamine solutions, any such acid can be used even if the product is slightly unstable, such as is the case for the formate, nitrate and perchlorate.Excess base may be removed by neutralizing to pH 7 9 before separating the sulfate solids and introducing the other acids as in Examples 25 28 and 31 36 . If it is desired to recover such salt in solid form, the alcohol may be evaporated off preferably under vacuum or may be precipitated by the addition of a non solvent for the salt such as a hydrocarbon. It is contemplated that such further reaction of hydroxylamine may be conducted prior to separating the by product sulfate. In the fourth form of the invention, as free hydroxylamine becomes available in the alcoholic solution, it may react with ketone or aldehyde provided that the proper pH is reached . Reaction of alcoholic hydroxylamine with a mineral acid inorganic acid is preferably, however, conducted only after the by product sulfate salt is removed. Organic acids, giving products which are in the liquid phase, are preferably reacted before removing the sulfate, but recovered from alcohol solvent after removing the solid sulfate phase. A convenient form of organic acid used in these instances is the ammonium or alkali metal salt of the organic acid i.e., as indicated for the third form of the invention using basic organic salts . Such salts may be hydrated but are preferably not. With anhydrous salts, as with alkoxides, no water of neutralization is formed.In making organic hydroxylammonium salts, especially, it is also preferred that substantially no water be introduced into the reaction mixture with the alcohol preferably the water alcohol ratio is 0.05 1 or less, more preferably 0.01 1 or less and most preferably 0.001 1 or less. In general the only water added with the alcohol is that forming an azeotrope with recycled alcohol. In such event, especially if anhydrous alkoxides or organic salts are used, the water content of the product liquid phase will be particularly low and, therefore, the sulphate level in the hydroxylammonium salt produced will be very low. The step of removing the by product solid sulfate from the alcoholic solution containing hydroxylamine values may be carried out using any conventional technique for separating a solid from a liquid. Centrifugation, filtration, decantation and other conventional engineering steps are included. It is preferred that the recovered solid be washed with a solvent such as the alcohol used for the solution to remove adhered hydroxylamine containing alcohol. Thereafter the solid may be dried, washed or recrystallized, treated in other ways to recover unreacted hydroxylammonium sulfate, or disposed of as initially separated. The hydroxylammonum salt now in alcohol solution can be recovered or transferred to aqueous media in a variety of ways. Simple evaporative crystallization will produce solid salt of reasonably high purity, and recrystallization may be used to improve purity. The solid salt may then be redissolved in water in selected amounts to produce aqueous solutions of desired concentrations. For salts which are unstable in concentrated form e.g. the perchlorate or nitrate , water can be added to the alcoholic solution, followed by evaporative concentration. In such event, the alcohol evaporated off for recycle to step a may be an azeotrope, which is approximately 1 water for methanol, approximately 4 water for ethanol and approximately 15 water for isopropanol.These azeotropes can be broken by conventional techniques if a lower water level is desired for step a so as to produce lower sulfate levels in the product . In the fourth form of the invention, once the reaction between alcoholic base and hydroxylammonium sulfate is complete, or while it is proceeding, the alcoholic solution containing hydroxylamine values may be further reacted with an organic reagent such as an aldehyde or ketone. In one mode, this reaction is conducted after separating the by product sulfate e.g., sodium sulfate from the alcoholic hydroxylamine solution. Thus, as illustrated in the Examples below, the alcoholic hydroxylamine solution is reacted with methyl ethyl ketone to produce methyl ethyl ketone oxime. Such reaction may be conducted at the pH normally used for the reaction involved, with pH between about 5 and about 8 used to convert ketones or aldehydes to oximes. It is contemplated that such further reaction of hydroxylamine may be conducted prior to separating the by product sulfate, such as by having a ketone present in or added with the alcoholic sodium hydroxide solution or added after the free base is liberated but before the sulfate salt is filtered out. In such case, as free hydroxylamine becomes available in the alcoholic solution, it reacts with ketone or aldehyde provided that the proper pH and temperature is reached . The various modes of reaction can be illustrated for acetone, for example, which like most carbonyl compounds reacts rapidly with hydroxylamine values only at pH 5 8 and temperatures of at least about 250C. Mode 1Step 1 Mix NaOH, MeOH, hydroxylammonium sulfate HS and acetone and stir at 50C for approximately 5 hoursStep 2 Adjust to pH about 8, raise temperature to 300C and stir for 2 hours.Step 3 Filter out Na2SO4 Step 4 Evaporate solvent and recover acetone oxime crystals. Mode 2 Same as Mode 1 with step 3 after adjusting to pH about 8 and before raising temperature to 300C. Mode 3Step 1 Mix NaOH, MeOH and HS and stir at 50C for about 5 hours.Step 2 Add acetone, adjust pH to about 8, raise temperature to 300C and stir for about 2 hours.Step 3 Filter out Na2SO4. Step 4 Evaporate solvent and recover acetone oxime crystals. Mode 4 Same as Mode 3 with step 3 after adjusting to pH 8 and before raising temperature to 300C. Modes 1 and 3, wherein the Na2SO4 is filtered out last, are preferred for three reasons first, the presence of Na2SO4 can help dry the liquid phase, even of by product water from the oximation reaction of step b second, any grit or other solids entering during any reaction step will be present in the by product sulfate salt rather than in the organic product crystals and, third, sulfate removal may be more complete with a larger and less polar organic liquid layer. Organic reactants suitable for the present process include any that will react with the hydroxylamine values in the liquid phase after reaction step a , with or without suitable pH and temperature adjustments.Suitable aldehydes which, on reaction, produce aldoximes, include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, proprionaldehyde, benzaldehyde, hydroxybenzaldehyde such as salicylaldehyde butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde. Suitable ketones which, on reaction, produce ketoximes include acetone, butanone MEK , 3pentanone diethylketone , benzoin, acetophenone, benzophenone, o hydroxybenzophenone and o hydroxyacetophenone. Benzoquinonedioxime can be produced by the present process from p nitrosophenol. Hydroxamic acids can be produced by the present process from esters and acid chlorides such as ethyl acetate and benzoyl chloride. The step of removing the by product solid from the alcoholic solution containing oxime or hydroxamic acid may be carried out using any conventional technique for separating a solid from a liquid. Centrifugation, filtration, decantation and other conventional engineering steps are included. It is preferred that the recovered solid be washed with a solvent such as the alcohol used for the solution to remove adhered hydroxylamine containing alcohol. Thereafter the solid may be dried, washed or recrystallized, treated in other ways to recover unreacted hydroxylammonium sulfate, or disposed of as initially separated. The product oxime or hydroxamic acid may be subjected to further reaction in the alcohol solvent or may be recovered therefrom by conventional techniques such as distillation, evaporative crystallization or precipitation with added non solvent. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples, which are not intended to limit the invention EXAMPLE 1 A solution of methanolic sodium hydroxide was prepared by mixing sodium hydroxide pellets 17.2 g 0.43 mol with absolute methanol 150 mL in a 250 mLErlenmeyer flask. In the meantime a 500 mL 3 necked flask was fitted with a thermometer, dropping funnel and nitrogen inlet inert atmosphere and a magnetic stirring bar PTFEcoated, 1 1 2 inches or 3.8 cm long was placed in it.Solid hydroxylamine sulfate 35 g 0.213 mol was placed in the flask with methanol 50 mL and the flask was placed in an ice water bath over a stir plate. With vigorous stirring, the methanolic NaOH solution was added slowly over 5 minutes using the dropping funnel, maintaining the reaction mixture temperature below 10 C. After the addition was complete, stirring was continuo4 for 1 1 2 hours more with cooling 5 100C . A white slurry resulted and this was filtered over a Buchner funnel and the cake was washed with more methanol 25 mL . The clear and colorless filtrate pH 12.5 analyzed for free hydroxylamine by mixing with known excess of methyl ethyl ketone MEK 40 g and ac the pH to 7 with concentrated H2SO4 2.5 g . Methyl ethyl ketoxime formed was determined by gas chromatography to correspond to free hydroxylamine 87.4 yield . The white filter cake 34.2 g of sodium sulfate was analyzed for remaining hydroxylamine sulfate by dissolving in water 150 mL and mixing with excess ol MEK 40 g and titrating with 50 NaOH solution 3.9 to pH 7. The amount of hydroxylamine sulfate left in the cake represented 11.4 of the total.
