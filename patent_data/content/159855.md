# Stepless speed change device for bicycle.

## Abstract
A stepless speed change device for a bicycle comprises a plurality of planetary members journaled in a carrier fixed to a crankshaft of the bicycle in two parallel planes perpendicular to the crankshaft, planetary gears respectively fitted on the plan etary members through one way clutches so as to rotate in one direction, an eccentric shifter having a circular track for guid ing rocking pins extending from and eccentric to the planetary members, the eccentric shifter capable of changing its eccen tricity relative to the crankshaft and a sun gear connected to a crank gear as an output portion of the device, thereby making it possible to make much larger diameters of the planetary gears than that of the sun gear so as to make much larger the speed up transmission ratio and at the same time so as to in crease the number of the planetary gears to make small pulsa tions in transmission force. According to the invention, the de vice includes a speed change operating device having for itself a performance of a reverse input allowing device so as to effec tively bring the stepless speed change device into pratical use. In this manner, the stepless speed change device becomes of light weight and small sized as a whole.
