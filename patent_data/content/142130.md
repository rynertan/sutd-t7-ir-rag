# Electrochemical sensor having an immobilized enzyme membrane.

## Abstract
A recess of a predetermined thickness is formed in the bottom of a cylindrical vessel and a hole for the liuqid junction is formed at the center of the recess, to which is joined a resilient NH₄ selective membrane. Since the NH₄ selective membrane has a thickness larger by about 0.1 mm than the depth of the recess, the NH₄ selective membrane is prot ruded out of the bottom of the vessel by so much. A polyester woven fabric on which urease is immobilized is attached to the vessel so as to cover the NH₄ selective membrane. Since the immobilized enzyme membrane is applied with an appropriate tension by the slightly protruded ion selective membrane, bondability between the two membranes can be improved.
