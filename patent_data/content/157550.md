# ROTARY ELECTRIC SWITCHES

## Abstract
A rotary electric switch, for example an automotive igni tion switch, has a rotor, a case holding the fixed contacts and an interlock mechanism. The interlock mechanism comprises a plunger and an interlock member carried by the rotor and a cam form on the case which cooperates with the plunger to limit movement of the rotor relative to the case. The interlock mem ber and plunger coact to normally retain the plunger out of con tact with the camform. At a given position of the rotor the plunger is released, whereby subsequent movement of the ro tor again to the given position is prevented by engagement of the plunger with the camform.
