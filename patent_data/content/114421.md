# Electromagnetic metering device having asymmetrical levers.

## Abstract
A device for metering liquids comprising an electromag net 1 having a recess extending in the axial direction and adapted to receive a metering hose 15 with an outlet valve, the electromagnet being provided with an armature 3 perpendicular to the axis, and a first lever 10 , upon an axial movement of the armature when the electromagnet is energized, closing the metering hose arranged in the recess completely at a first location 14 , and a second lever 12 , upon a further axial movement of the armature 3 , exerting on the metering hose 15 a pressure deforming substantially in the radial direction at a second location between the first location and the outler valve.
