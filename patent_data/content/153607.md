# Multi wire mineral insulated cable thermocouple reference junction.

## Abstract
Apparatus for making a transition from leads 12 26 of a temperature measuring thermocouple to extension wires 44 58 within a hermetically sealed cable sheath 60 of small diameter. The interior of the cable sheath 60 is shielded from electromagnetic radiation by an electrically conductive liner 62 . A thermally conductive, electrically insulating material 66 surrounds the intermediate junctions 28 42 . The temperature of the intermediate junctions 28 42 is measured 64 providing a signal to compensate the voltage generated by the temperature measuring ther mocouples due to the thermoelectric effect of the intermedi ate junctions 28 42 .
