# High intensity discharge lamps.

## Abstract
High intensity discharge lamp is fabricated in a fash ion generally similar to a standard high pressure mercury lamp which has a red emitting phosphor coated on the outer envelope. In the present lamp, the discharge sus taining filling in the arc tube is modified to include a small, predetermined proportion of cadmium which adds radiations of a wavelength of about 490 nm to the com posite lamp emission. The resulting composite emission has greatly improved color rendering properties as com pared to a similar lamp which does not incorporate the cadmium addition to the arc tube filling.
