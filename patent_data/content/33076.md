# Character recognition method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A character recognition circuit is provided with the image of unknown characters, in an accessible memory. A microp rocessor directs a microcontroller to access the memory and to perform pixel counting, transition recognition and pattern finding. The microprocessor directs such operations and effectively locates lines of unknown characters, deskews those lines if necessary, roughly identifies each unknown character by forming a window around the character and counting pixels inwardly from the top and bottom and from each side until a transition is reached from white 0 to black 1 , and from that information as weighted and combined, categorizing the unknown character to be of a particular set of known characters. By comparing the unknown characer with the possible known characters, the unknown character is posi tively identified and stored in a random access memory until the entire message is assembled. Then the message is sent to a buffer unit for ultimate transmission.
