# Solventless thermosetting cement coat compositions.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a solvent free wire enamel cement coat which is curable to the B stage with ultraviolet light. The wire can then be formed into a coil and cured with heat to the C stage. The cement coat composition comprises a mixture of a UV photosensitizer and a curing agent with either an acrylated epoxy or an amine terminated acrylated epoxy or an acrylated urethane, or mixtures thereof, all dissolved in a monoacrylate. The composition can also include an end blocked urethane, an acrylated hexamethoxymethyl mela mine, or a low molecular weight cresol formaldehyde resin.
