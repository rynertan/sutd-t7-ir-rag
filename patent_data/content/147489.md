# Friction reducers for lubricants and fuels.

## Abstract
N alkoxyalkyl amides may be formed by the reaction of primary alkoxyalkylamines with carboxylic acids such as formic acid, or alternatively by ammonolysis of the appropri ate formate ester. The resultant amides exhibit friction reducing properties when incorporated in additive amounts in lubricants and fuels. Extremely low concentrations of such additives, i.e. N alkoxyalkyl formamides in lubricating oils result in vastly improved, i.e. lowered coefficients of friction. By virtue of the friction reducing characteristics and lubricity properties, the additive compositions of the present inven tion exhibit reduced wear on rubbing surfaces.
