# Equalizer arrangements.

## Abstract
An equalizer arangement for digital transmission systems is disclosed including a variable gain amplifier in one branch of a two branch admittance circuit. The branch including the amplifier includes two frequency dependent admittances while the other branch is insensitive to frequency. Varying the gain of the amplifier provides a minimum phase network which can be automatically adjusted to compensate for varying lengths and gauges of telephone pairs. This configuration permits digital transmission in the subscriber loop plant at rates up to 200 kilobits per second.
