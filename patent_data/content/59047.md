# ROTARY VALVE CYLINDER HEAD

## Abstract
A rotary valve cylinder head includes a cylinder head body 10 which defines a cylindrical region therein and having a dual port combustion chamber 14 disposed adjacent the head end of the cylindrical region, a piston 16 reciprocatable within the cylindrical region, and rotary valve devices disposed in the cylinder head body 10 for controlling flow of gas to and from the combustion chamber 14 . The rotary valve devices include a pair of cylindrical rotary valve members 36, 38 parallel to each other on opposite sides of the cylindrical region. The valve members 36, 38 are journalled in bearing means 39, 41 disposed between the valve members 36, 38 and the cyl inder head body 10 . Each bearing means 39, 41 receives a respective sealing member 68, 69 disposed around a respec tive port 25, 31 and between the bearing means 39, 41 and the cylinder head body 10 . Each sealing member 68, 69 is an endless loop and encircles the respective port 25, 31 . The lateral cross sectional shape of each sealing member 68, 69 provides compressive elasticity so that movement of the bear ing means 39, 41 ,which are metal impregnated graphite seal ing screens, can be accommodated without separation be tween the bearing means 39, 41 and the cylinder head body 10 .
