# Centrifugal pump for the supply of finely divided solids and process for the gasification of coal particles.

## Abstract
Centrifugal pump for the supply of finely divided solids to a pressurized vessel 1 , comprising a rotor 5, 6 which is rotatably arranged in the vessel 1 and a supply tube 7 for the supply of the solids in a carrier gas. The tube 7 is axially connected to one side 5 of the rotor. A discharge tube 8 for the carrier gas is connected to the other side 6 of the rotor in line with the supply tube 7 . The pump is very suitable for application in the gasification of coal particles. The coal particles are supplied to the gasification reactor with the aid of the centrifugal pump.
