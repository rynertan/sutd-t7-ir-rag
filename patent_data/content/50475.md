# Scanning image forming apparatus using photo electric signal.

## Abstract
A scanning image forming apparatus using a photore sponse signal such as a photo voltage signal obtained by scanning the surface of a semiconductor specimen 1 with a photon beam 5 is subjected to second order differentiation 33 . An image is displayed 7 by employing the second deriv ative of the photo response signal as a modulation signal Z .
