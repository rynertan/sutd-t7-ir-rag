# High temperature brazing alloys.

## Abstract
A brazing alloy composition for joining chromium containing base metal alloys containing, by weight, palla dium about 39 60 , nickel about 20 47.5 , and at least one element selected from the group consisting of silver 0 35 , tin 0 32 , indium 0 32 and gallium 0 11 and optionally containing one or more elements selected from the group consisting of gold 0 10 , germanium 0 4.4 . silicon 0 2.9 and about 0.025 of a known deoxidizer such as lithium. The alloy exhibits good wetting and flowing characteristics and has excellent strength and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. The brazing alloy is particularly useful for joining chromium containing base metal alloys of the type which are used in the porcelain fused to metal technic in dental prosthetics.
