## Description
This invention relates to decoding receivers for Manchester encoded signals and, in particular, to a method for recovering a decoding clock signal from a Manchester encoded signal received on a data communication signalling line. We draw attention to our copending European Patent Application EP A 0186462 published on 02.07.86 corresponding to A 4,606,052, published on 12.08.86. The proliferation of localised data processing and data handling equipment has spurred provision of data signal communication via inexpensive communication links between these various equipments linked together to form local area network systems. Serial transmission of data on only one inexpensive signal line such as a twisted pair of wires or a coaxial cable is a cost effective way of linking data equipment into a local area network. Data signals sent on signal lines are subject to distortion and electrical interference, in the form of impulse noise and the like. Recovery of data information from a distorted and noisy transmitted data signal by a receiver requires the use of a local clock signal at the receiver. Providing a separate clock signal at the receiver site which is synchronous with the transmitted data is a significant problem. Transmitting a separate clock signal on a separate line is an expensive solution. Conventional non return to zero NRZ data signals usually contain a direct current dc component, which is particularly strong on long strings of ONEs or ZEROs. For NRZ data signals, the dc component must be propagated through the signal line. It should be appreciated that transmission of a data signal through an alternating current ac coupled signal line is desirable and that providing for direct current dc coupling of a data signal is an expensive undertaking. Manchester encoding of a data signal prior to transmission overcomes the above mentioned problems of transmitting a separate clock signal and of providing dc coupling for the data signal. A Manchester encoded data signal solves these problems by being a so called self clocking signal and by having no dc component. In simplest form, a Manchester encoded signal can be thought of as being generated by combining the data signal with the clock signal. The combination is then transmitted through an ac coupled transmission medium. To generate a Manchester encoded signal an NRZ data signal and a square wave clock signal are combined in an EXCLUSIVE OR gate to produce a Manchester encoded signal having a 50 50 duty cycle. For one half of a bit period, the Manchester encoded signal is at a ONE binary level, and for the other half of the bit period, the Manchester encoded signal is at its complementary binary level. Consequently, no dc component is produced and Manchester encoded signals, having no dc component, are well suited for transmission through ac coupled systems. From the above, it should be recognized, that for each bit period of a Manchester encoded signal, a transition from a binary ZERO to a binary ONE, or vice versa, must occur. This doubles the transmission bandwidth required for a Manchester encoded transmission system but provides significant advantages, as described above. For a square wave clock, the transition occurs at the middle of the bit cell, or bit period. Depending upon the phase of the clock signal in a bit period, the transition from a ZERO to a ONE level represents either a ONE data bit or ZERO data bit. Similarly, the transition from a one to a zero level represents the opposite type of data bit. Because the Manchester encoded data signal always has a transition occurring at the middle of the bit period, a clock signal can, in principle, be recovered at a receiver. However, distortion and noise on a received Manchester encoded signal make detection of data transitions and subsequent reconstruction of a received clock signal difficult because a receiver cannot distinguish between a valid Manchester encoded signal and noise. This situation is particularly troublesome when a signal line has been in an ideal state with no signals on the line and when a valid Manchester encoded signal is subsequently sent. A receiver which cannot adequately distinguish noise signals from the start of the sequence of valid Manchester encoded signals is unable to begin to properly recover the clock signal and ultimately to provide a synchronzied clock signal for subsequent recovery of Manchester encoded data signals. Thus, it should be appreciated that recovery and synchronization of clock signal for a Manchester encoded data receiver are critical functions. The problems of synchronization of a receiver clock and recognition of valid Manchester encoded signal activity on a signalling line, have been addressed with a number of system solutions. For example, systems which operate in conformity with MIL STD 1553 use a so cabled synchronizing impulse data string which precedes valid data. The synchronizing impulse, or course, can be sent on a separate signal line, but obviously, that is an undesirable solution. In another approach, a conventional analog phase locked loop is used in a receiver to lock on the input signal and recover a receive clock reference signal. However, fast clock acquisition requires wide loop bandwidths while operation with noisy signals narrow loop bandwidths, and the resulting receiver suffers a compromised performance. Reference may be made to Patent Publication WO A 8 404 863. This describes a circuit for recovering a clock signal from a Manchester encoded signal. It includes means for generating a recovered clock signal having a period of approximately T a transition detector detecting the transitions zero crossings of the received data signal means for comparing in time the transitions of the received data signal with those of the recovered clock signal and means for adjusting the period of the recovered clock signal to be longer than, equal to, or shorter than the previous period, depending on whether the transitions of the received data signal lead, are coincident with, or lag those of the recovered clock signal. We will describe a method for rapidly recovering the clock from Manchester encoded signals using only simple digital techniques. This includes detection of zero crossings of the received Manchester encoded signal and adjusting the frequency of the recovered clock by comparing the occurrence of the zero crossing of the received signal with the occurrence of the midpoint of the period of the presently generated recovered clock. Shorten, center and lengthen adjustment signals are provided as a result of the comparison which are used to shorten or lengthen by a 1 16 increment of the received bit period, the period of the next generated recovered clock. A technique readily implemented on a sixteen state programmable counter, uses the adjustment signals and the state of the programmable counter in simple Boolean equations to determine the next state of the programmable counter. In this way, a one state self loop or a two state jump is performed to effect a 1 16 bit period lengthening, or shortening, respectively, of the period of the counter. The present invention provides a method of recovering the clock from Manchester encoded signals detected on a pair of signal lines, said Manchester encoded signals being a serial Manchester encoded stream of bits, each having an inter bit period T, comprising the steps of The accompanying drawings which are incorporated into and form a part of the specification, illustrate the invention and, together with their description, and serve to explain the principles of the invention.

The invention described herein is the Receiver portion of a single integrated circuit identified as the Advanced Micro Devices Am7960 Coded Data Transceiver. FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of the Receiver portion of the integrated circuit. A functional block diagram of a Manchester encoded Receiver 100 constructed according to the teachings of the instant invention is illustrated in FIG. 1. Reference should be had to the related copending application Serial No. 684,085, filed December 21, 1984 on behalf of Roy Levy and Frederick Hirzel entitled A Method for Detection of Line Activity for Manchester encoded Signals , assigned to the assignee of the instant application, which is hereby incorporated by reference, for a detailed description of the following elements illustrated in FIG. 1 the Receive Line Activity Counter 110, the Receive Clock Qualification 120, the Receive Data Interpreter and Supervisor 130 and the Receive Decode Logic 140. Briefly, the Manchester encoded signals are received at receiver line terminals RxL0, RxL1 at a receive interface not illustrated portion of receiver 100. The ST and ST , and the line input data signals generated by a receiver channel interface are applied to a Receive Clock Qualification block 120 and a Receive Data Interpreter and Supervisor block 130, respectively of Receiver 100. As shown in FIG. 2, status signals are generated at an advance carrier presence ACP , a carrier presence CP and a carrier sense CS , terminal of Receiver 100 and signals are generated at a receive clock RxC and a receive data RXD terminals thereof in response to the ST , ST and line data signals applied thereto. Internal counterparts, preceded by the letter I , for these signals are used synonomously hereinafter, for instance IACP is used to represent the internal advance carrier presence signal. As shown on FIG. 2, after the Receiver 100 has detected line activity 200 at the RxL0, RxL1 terminals of the Receiver, it attempts to acquire information from the line data to generate the signals at the RxC terminal. This so called Clock Qualification takes place within block 120 and is achieved by sampling the presence levels ST and ST . There must be a differential line voltage signal applied to the RxL0 and RxL1 terminals either above the positive presence level and then below the negative presence level, or below the negative presence level and then above the positive presence level, in 3 4 to 1 1 4 the inter bit time of the input LINE DATA. After this occurs, the next detected line activity 202, causes Receiver 100 to initiate acquisition of the receive clock recovery circuitry 150, 204, as shown in FIG. 2 In response to detection of the transitions of the LINE DATA signals, line activity 200, the Receiver 100 causes the signal at the The Receiver 100 causes the signal at the As shown on the fourth waveform of FIG. 2, the Receiver 100 causes the signal at the The Receiver 100 decodes the input data by sampling within block 130 at 1 4 and 3 4 bit intervals following the start of the inter bit time. If these samples are of opposite binary polarity, valid Manchester encoded data has been decoded. If these samples are of the same binary polarity as is the sample at the next 1 4 bit interval, the Receiver 100 determines that an end of message has been detected, 228.

A line signal having a differential voltage greater than the positive carrier presence level or less than the negative carrier presence level will cause Receiver 100 to set IACP HIGH and to retain this value until there is no line signal having such a differential voltage for two consecutive bit times. A second internal signal is advanced carrier sense ACS which indicates if the line activity which caused the Receiver 100 to set IACP HIGH is valid Manchester encoded data. The Receiver 100 sets An edge EDGE internal signal is set HIGH whenever the Receiver 100 detects a ZERO crossing by the input line data. A clock recovery preset CRESET signal is set HIGH for one clock cycle following the next line data edge EDGE HIGH after the line activity is detected, IACP HIGH , and the data qualification is complete ACS HIGH . CRESET is set HIGH once during reception of input line data by Receiver 100. A line acquisition LA signal is set HIGH following CRESET set HIGH until a physical line quiet or logical decoded end of message. The data sampling signals 1 4 and 3 4 are used to determine whether the line input data is valid Manchester encoded. The line data is sampled at a 1 4 and a 3 4 interval from the start of an the current intra bit time interval. A DATA signal is set HIGH if the decoded line data is valid Manchester encoded based on the opposite logical polarity at the 1 4 and 3 4 sample times . A logical end of message EOM 1 4 is set HIGH whenever no line activity is detected and will be reset LOW when CRESET is set HIGH and will remain LOW until the logical end of message or LA is set LOW. A digital phase locked loop on DPLLON signal is set HIGH on the 1 4 sample interval after the CRESET and LA signals have been set HIGH. The HIGH DPLLON signal indicator that the line activity detection function of the Receiver 100 has been accomplished and that the Receive Supervisor can start to generate the external receive output signals RxC and RxD. Accordingly, a HIGH DPLLON signal must be followed by a resetting of DPLLON to LOW before the Receiver 100 can begin line activity detection again. With reference to FIG. 1, the CRESET and EDGE signals generated by the Receive Data Interpreter and Supervisor 130 and the DPLLON signal generated by the Receive Decode Logic 140 portions of receiver 100 are applied to a Receive Clock Recovery 150 block of receive 100. Briefly, the method used by Receive Clock Recovery 150 is that a recovered clock oscillator portion 152 530 on Fig. 5 of block 150 is asynchronous at a frequency approximately 16 times the inter bit frequency of the line input data until a HIGH CRESET signal is received from the receive supervisor portion 136 of block 130. At this time, which will be at approximately the midpoint of the first Manchester encoded cell received following detection of line activity A Receive Clock recovery logic portion 154 574 on Fig. 5 receives four signals an extra phase locked loop XPLL signal, a complemented phase locked loop 2 The HIGH Recovered clock to data clock phase detector 156 receives the The method used by the Receive Clock Recovery 150 of the present invention is to adjust the recovered clock oscillator by tracking the data edge The shorten register comprises an internally clocked delay flip flop 584 generating a The Boolean equations governing the operation of the shorten register 584 is accordingly Hence a HIGH SHORTEN signal will be generated at the next internal clock following the 3 4 sampling i.e., at 13 16 of the interbit period from the mid period if the EDGE signal is received coincident with all three LOW phase locked loop signals generated by oscillator block 152 indicating that none of the stages of the counter implementing the recovered clock oscillator 152 had been set simultaneously with or prior to reception of the The center register similarly comprises an internally clocked delay flip flop 596 generating a CENTER signal at its Q output and a Hence a HIGH CENTER signal will be generated at the next internal clock following the 3 4 sampling if the EDGE signal is received coincident with the generation of a HIGH signal for only the first two phase locked loop signals generated by oscillator block 152, indicating either synchronization with the reception of the Similarly the lengthen register is governed by the Boolean equations Hence a HIGH LENGTHEN signal will be generated at the next internal clock following the 3 4 sampling if the EDGE signal is received coincident with HIGH signals for all three phase locked loop signals being generated by oscillator block 152, indicating an overrunning of the reception of the The The NOR gate 598 within oscillator 152 also receives the Accordingly, if both the Alternatively, if either the The counter within the recovered clock oscillator 152 530 on Fig. 5 consists of a four stage digital phase locked loop circuit with each stage comprising a multiplexing latch 532, 538, 546 and 554 connected via an OR gate 537, 544, 552 and 560, respectively, to the input of an associated internally clocked delay flip flop generating the true, and complemented, a least significant phase locked loop 0 PLL0, The selection inputs of the least significant and next to least significant multiplexing 532 and 538 latches are as described above. The selection input to the latch associated with the flip flop 550 generating the PLL2, These interconnections result in a clock recovery state machine describing the operation of the recovered clock oscillator 152 as shown in Table I, below, in which the value of the true signals XPLL, PLL3, PLL2, PLL1, PLL0 are indicated as L for LOW and H for HIGH. With reference to Table I, the fourth line refers to the state S at which a 1 4 sample signal is generated by the receive clock recovery logic 154 using the output of a NOR gate receiving the XPLL, PLL3 AND Lines five, six and seven correspond to the SHORTEN window and by reference to the Boolean equation, above, for SHORTEN Similarly, the eighth line of Table I corresponds to the CENTER window state W20 and by reference to the Boolean equation, above, for CENTER Finally, the ninth, tenth ,and eleventh lines of Table I correspond to the LENGTHEN window and by reference to the Boolean equation, above, for LENGTHEN, show that during the corresponding lengthen window states W30, W31 and W32, the three signals XPLL, PLL3 and PLL2 will be HIGH and therefore, a HIGH EDGE signal received during any of these states will cause the HIGH LENGTHEN signal to be generated, as required by the Boolean equation. The twelfth line of Table I refers to the state S1 at which a 3 4 sample signal is generated by the receive clock recovery logic 154 using the output of a NOR gate 572 receiving the XPLL, The logic interconnections described for the selection inputs to the multiplexing latches of the counter within oscillator 152, above, cause the transition from one state to the next according to their position in Table I, i.e., beginning at reset, the counter changes from W30 to W31, then to W32, etc. However, because the selection inputs to the least significant latch and to the next to least significant latch depend on the
