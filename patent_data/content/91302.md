The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Rx group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. A reactive N acylating derivative of the acid IV is employed in the above process. The choice of reactive derivative will of course be influenced by the chemical nature of the substituents of the acid. Suitable N acylating derivatives include an acid halide, preferably the acid chloride or bromide.Acylation with an acid halide may be affected in the presence of an acid binding agent for example, tertiary amine such as triethylamine or dimethylaniline , an inorganic base such as calcium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate or an oxirane, which binds hydrogen halide liberated in the acylation reaction. The oxirane is preferably a C16 l,2,alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.

The acid halide may be prepared by reacting the acid IV or a salt thereof with a halogenating eg. chlorinating or brominating agent such as phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. The acid halide may also be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted phenylacetyl halide, wherein any reactive substituents are protected, with a sulphonating agent, such as, for example, the sulphur trioxide dioxane complex. Alternatively, the N acylating derivative of the acid IV may be a symmetrical or mixed anhydride.Suitable mixed anhydrides are alkoxyformic anhydrides, or anhydrides with, for example carbonic acid monoesters, trimethyl acetic acid, thioacetic acid, diphenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, phosphorus acids such as phosphoric or phosphorous acids , sulphuric acid or aliphatic or aromatic sulphonic acids such as p toluenesulphonic acid .

The starting material of formula III is disclosed in British Patent No. 1,339,007. Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and Rx are as defined above and R5 is C16 alkyl, aryl or benzyl with methanol in the presence of a metal ion, such as mercury, lead, silver, cadmium, thallium, tellurium or bismuth. This reaction may generally be carried out at a temperature of from 500C to 250C, but is conveniently carried out between 50C and 250C. Any suitable solvent may be employed. It is generally convenient however to use methanol as the solvent. Preferably R5 in formula V represents methyl. Any reactive groups in the side chain will suitably be protected prior to the present process and deprotected subsequently. Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by a treating a compound of formula VI EMI10.1 wherein Rx is a carboxyl blocking group, and R6 is an acyl group, in particular an acyl group derived from the side chain of a natural penicillin, such as benzyl penicillin or phenoxymethyl penicillin with an agent forming an imino halide b treating the imino halide with a compound to introduce a group QRf on the imino carbon atom, wherein Q is oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen and Rf is an alkyl group of from 5 to 14 carbon atoms, to form an iminoether, iminothioether, or amidine when Q is 0, S, or N respectively c reacting with an N acylating derivative of an acid of formula IV and wherein any reactive groups may be protected d treating with water and e optionally removing the carboxyl blocking group Rx and any protecting groups on the side chain. A suitable agent for preparing an imino halide is an acid halide in the presence of an acid binding agent such as a tertiary amine, eg. pyridine, triethylamine, or N,N dimethylaniline. Examples of suitable acid halides are phosphorus pentachloride, phosgene, phosphorous pentabromide, phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride and p toluene sulphonic acid chloride. Phosphorus pentachloride and phosphorus oxychloride are preferred. The reaction may be conducted under cooling, preferably at temperatures from OOC to 300C when phosphorous pentachloride is employed. The amount of the tertiary amine is preferably 3 5 mols per mol of phosphorus pentachloride. It is also preferable to use the phosphorus halide in an amount slightly in excess of that of the starting material. The resulting imino compounds are then treated to introduce a QRf group onto the imino carbon atom.This is preferably effected by reacting the imino halide with a corresponding alcohol. Examples of suitable alcohols for reaction wih the imino halide are aliphatic alcohols containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, amyl alcohol and butyl alcohol, and aralkyl alcohols such as benzyl alcohol and 2 phenylethanol. The reaction of the alcohol with the imino halide is preferably effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, such as a tertiary amine, preferably pyridine, and the reaction is usually carried out without isolating the imino halide from the reaction mixture. Finally, the product is treated with water. The water treatment may be conducted together with the isolation of the desired material. That is the reaction mixture may be added to water or a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then the aqueous layer formed is separated from the organic solvent layer.
