The compounds of the present invention may be produced according to EUROPEAN PATENT APPLICATIONPublication Number 48999 by the following process A Antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 9129B1 or OA 6l29B2, or salt thereof having formula l a obtained by cultivating Streptomyces sp. OA 6129 deposited in Fermentation Research Institute, Japan, onSeptember 26,1980, which was accepted as the international deposit FERM BP ll on May 1,1981, according to BUDAPESTTREATY ON THE INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OFTHE DEPOSIT OF MICROORGANISMS FOR THE PURPOSEOF PATENT PROCEDURE in a nutrient culture medium, is esterified to obtain an ester thereof by the method known per se. The antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B2, or salt thereof may be treated with substituted or unsubstituted benzyl halide, for example, such as benzyl chloride, benzyl bromide, p nitrobenzyl chloride, p nitrobenzyl bromide, p methcxybenzyl bromide, 2,4 dinitrobenzyl chloride and p bromobenzyl bromide, to form ester thereof. Generally, the reaction is preferably carried out in ar inert liquid medium. Useful inert liquid media are, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene chloride amides such as dimethyl formamide and hexamethylphosphoramide ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane esters such as ethyl acetate and n butyl acetate and ketones such as acetone and methylethyl ketone.These liquid media may be used alone or as a mixture of more than two of them if required. The reaction temperature is not critical but may be widely varied depending on the kind of halide and liquid media employed. It may be selected in the range that antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B2is not much decomposed.Generally a reaction temperature below 600C, preferably in the range between zero and 400C, and more preferably between 5DC and room temperature is advantageous. Accelerator for the reaction such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide may be added to said reaction if required. The reaction can be completed within 1 to 24 hours, usually within 3 to 12 hours under said conditions. Antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B or OA 6129B2 1 2 to be allowed to react with said halide is not necessarily used after isolation but may be used in the form of a broth of antibiotic OA 6129Aproducing microorganism mentioned above, in the form of the cultured broth after removal of cells, or in the form of a crude preparation of the antibiotic that is partially purified according to the isolation and purification process mentioned above.As such a partially purified preparation, there are mentioned, for example, a concentrate of eluate from active carbon on which the cultured broth is adsorbed a concentrate of eluate from DIAION HP 20 Mitsubishi Chemical IndustriesLtd. on which the cultured broth is adsorbed a concentrate obtained by adsorbing the concentrate mentioned above on QAE Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB ,eluting with a sodium chloridegradient in phosphate buffer solution and desalting with active carbon and a concentrate of butanol extract at pH 3.5 and low temperature. Esters of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B thus obtained may be isolated and purified 2 from the reaction mixture by various methods known per se. For example, at first, the reaction mixture is poured into aqueous medium in order to remove water soluble impurities like side products. At that time, a neutral buffer solution is desirably used as the aqueous medium to maintain neutral pH of the mixture. Then, the mixture is treated with practically waterimmiscible non polar organic solvent and the ester of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6l29E1 or OA 6129B2 is extracted into the organic solvent layer. Salts such as sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate may be added to the extraction mixture to obtain higher extraction efficiency by the salting out effect.The organic solvent layer is dried with Glauber s salt. The ester may be isolated and purified according to the methods known per se, for example, by the appropriate combination of gel filtration with BIOBEADSS X3 BioRads Co. or Sephadex LH 20 PharmaciaCo. and adsorption chromatography with silica gel, alumina or FLORIGIL Florigin Co. , or by repeated use thereof if required. B Substituted or unsubstituted benzyl esters of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B 7 or OA 6129B 2 obtained can be converted to cyclic ketal or cyclic acetal derivatives in which i and hydroxyl groups bound to the carbon atom at 3 position of the pantoyl group are etherified simultaneously.The ketal or acetal formation may be accomplished by the method known per se. For example, esters of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B2 can be converted to cyclic ketal or acetal derivatives thereof by allowing the ester to react with ketone or aldehyde derivatives. Generally the reaction is preferably carried out in the reaction agent employed as the reaction solvent. As suitable reagents there are mentioned, for example, acetone, 2,2dimethoxypropane, formaldehyde, 2,2 dimethoxyethane, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acetophenone, diphenylketone, dibenzylketone, 1, 1 diphenylketone and cyclohexanone. These reagents may be employed alone or as a mixture of more than two of them if required. Inert solvents may also be mixed depending on the solubility of the ester of antibiotic OA 6129A,OA 6129B1 and OA 6129B2. The reaction temperature is not critical but may be widely varied depending on the kind of liquid medium used. It may be selected in the range that the ester of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1, or OA 6129B2 is not much decomposed. Generally a reaction temperature below 600C, preferably in the range between 400 C and 400C, and more preferably between Oc C and room temperature is advantageous.Accelerator for the reaction such as p toluenesulfonic acid, boron trifluoride etherate and zinc chloride may be added to the said reaction if required. The reaction can be completed within 30 minutes to 12 hours, usually within 2 to 5 hours under said conditions. Cyclic ketal or cyclic acetal derivatives of said esters thus obtained may be isolated and purified from the reaction mixture by methods known per se. For example, the reaction mixture is treated with amines after completion of reaction to inactivate excess of the accelerator for the reaction, and then poured into practically waterimmiscible non polar organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, benzene and chloroform. The .organic phase is washed with aqueous medium to remove water soluble impurities like side products.At that time, a neutral buffer solution is desirably used as the aqueous medium. The organic solvent layer is concentrated to dryness. The aimed cyclic ketal or cyclic acetal derivatives may be isolated and purified according to the method known per se, for example, by the appropriate combination of chromatographies with silica gel, BIOBEADS Bio Rads Labs. and Sephadex LH 20 Pharmacia Pine Chemicals AB , or by repeated use thereof if required. C S Oxidation of the cyclicketal or cyclic acetal derivatives thus obtained of esters of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 9129B or derivatives thereof 2 obtained by etherifying simultaneouslyA and hydroxyl groups at 3 position of the pantoyl group can be performed according to the method known per se, for example, that is often employed in the case of S oxidation of sulfur containing t lactam antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.For example, mild oxidizing agents such as perbenzoic acid, phenyl dichloroiodide, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide and sodium periodate may be employed for the reaction, which do not act on the carbapenem nucleus practically. As the mild oxidizing agents, peracid is suitable. Preferably perbenzoic acid and m chloroperbenzoic acid are mentioned, and most preferably substituted perbenzoic acid such as mchloroperbenzoic acid is used. The reaction between esters of antibioticOA 6129A, OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B2 . or derivatives thereof obtained by etherifying simultaneouslyo and t hydroxyls of the pantoyl group and the oxidizing agents,may be advantageously carried out in inert solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride at room temperature or a lower temperature, preferably under mild conditions such as at a temperature between about 40 0C and about 200C,The reaction can usually be completed within 3 minutes to 3 hours under said conditions. An amount of oxidizing agent used for the oxidation may be widely varied depending on the kind of oxidizing agent and reaction conditions.Generally, a range between 0.8 and 1.8 molar equivalents per mole of the compound to be treated, and preferably between 1.0 and 1.3 molar equivalents is suitale. After completion of the reaction, the S oxidation products can be isolated and purified according to various methods known per se, which are usually employed for isolation and purification of carbapenem antibiotics. For example, after the reaction is completed, solids are removed from the reaction mixture by filtration. To the filtrate is added a buffer solution such as phosphate buffer solution in order to keep neutral pH during further processes.The aimed compounds can be isolated and purified by the following procedures alone or by an appropriate combination thereof, for example, combination of adsorption on active carbon, Amberlite XAD 2 Rhom and Haas Co. or DIAION HP 20 Mitsubishi IndustriesLtd. and elution with methanol water or acetone water adsorption and elution procedures with ion exchangers such as Dowex 1X2 Dow Chemicals Co. ,Dowex 50X2 Dow Chemicals Co. and QAE Sephadex A 25 PharmaciaFine Chemicals AB and Biogel P 2 Bio Rads Labs. column or thin layer chromatography with cellulose, Avicel SF American Viscose Corp. , DEAE celluloseWhatman DE 32 Whatman Inc. , DEAE Sephadex A 25 Pharmacia FineChemicals AB , silica gel and alumina forced precipitation by addition of solvents such as acetone and lyophilization. Hydrolysates carboxylic acids of esters obtained from the compounds according to the present invention or salts thereof have broad antimicrobial spectrum. On various microorganims, especially onGram positive bacteria belonging to , for example,Staphylococcus, Sarcina and Bacillus, extremely high antimicrobial activity is shown. In addition, even on Gram negative bacteria belonging to, for example,Alcaligenes and Comamonas, they have very high activity.The esters show a spilar antimicrobial activity on an agar medium containing 10X horse serum Nippon Bio SupplyCenter . Carboxylic acid forms of the cyclic ketals or cyclic acetals according to the present invention obtained by etherifying simultaneouslyo and hydroxyls of pantoyl group being contained in esters of antibiotic OA 6129A, OA 6129B1 orOA 6129B 2 demonstrate noticeable antimicrobial activity on Gram negative bacteria belonging to, for example,Escherichia and Klebsiella. It is characteristic that the compounds according to the present invention have remarkably high antimicrobial activity on Gram negative bacteria, for example, such as Citrobacter, Proteus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Serratia that are resistant against antibiotics containing g lactam ring. In addition, S oxides of cyclic ketal and cyclic acetal derivatives according to the present invention, in whichc and T hydroxyls of pantoyl group being containing in esters of antibiotic OA 6129A,OA 6129B1 or OA 6129B2 are simultaneously etherified, can be converted to useful substituted derivatives that have an ethyl or l hydroxyethyl group at 6 position, or sulfur containing chain at 3 position of 7 oxo 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid nucleus, by the method described in the specification of EUROPEANPATENT APPLICATION Publication Number 11173 mentioned above.
