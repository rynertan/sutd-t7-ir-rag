# Process for oxidation of olefinically unsaturated compounds.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for epoxidising an olefinic double bond in an olefinically unsaturated compound other than an α, β unsaturated carboxylic acid or a com pound containing a six membered ring wherein 3 to 4 member atoms are carbon atoms having sp² hybrid orbitals, by treatment of a liquid phase mixture of the olefinically unsaturated compound, an aldehyde containing at least two carbon atoms and a suitable solvent with oxygen in the pres ence of a catalyst which is soluble in the reaction mixture and which comprises a praseodymium compound. The process has particularly advantageous application to oxidation of aldrin to dieldrin.
