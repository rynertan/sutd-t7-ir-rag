# POLYEPOXIDE CURING BY POLYMERCAPTANS PLUS CATALYTIC CO CURING AGENTS

## Abstract
Extremely rapid ambient curing of polyepoxide resins and mixtures of polyepoxide resins and polyacrylate esters is achieved by use of a curing system composed of at least one polymercaptan and at least one catalytic co curing agent which is the condensation product of a aliphatic amine or substituted aliphatic amine con taining at least one primary aliphatic amine group where the aliphatic moiety is ethylene or greater with b at least one amino acid, its corresponding lactam or other amide forming derivative. Optionally, known Lewis Base catalysts for the epoxy mercaptan reaction, such as tertiary amines, may also be used.
