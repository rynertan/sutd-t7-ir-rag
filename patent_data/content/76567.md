## Description
LOAD SENSING VALVEThis invention relates to a load sensing valve for vehicle braking systems.Such valves are known for regulating the braking pressure in accordance with vehicle load and are widely used in air pressure braking systems. Basically valves of this kind comprise a brake valve connected to an actuator through a balancing beam mechanism the moment arm ratio of which is adjustable usually by moving the fulcrum of the beam to vary the ratio of the pressure output of the brake valve to the pressure at the input thereof. The adjustment can be achieved in a variety of ways, e.g. by a mechanical linkage responsive to the suspension loading or by fluid means responsive tothe pressure of fluid in a pneumatic or hydraulic suspension system. Known loadsensing valves, however, suffer from linearity errors which can be as high as 25 for certain air pressure valves.In accordance with the present invention we propose a load sensing valve in which the moment arm ratio of the balancing beam mechanism is adjustable by a transmission connected to an input actuator responsive to variation in the load, the output displacement of the transmission being a non linear function of its input in the sense to compensate for non linearities in the balance beam mechanism. By choice of a suitable transmission it is possible significantly to reduce or even avoid altogether linearity errors in load sensing valves.The transmission is preferably a mechanical linkage comprising a bell crank lever one end of which has a sliding pivotal connection with the input actuator. Where adjustment of the moment arm ratio is achieved by moving the pivot of the balance beam mechanism, the other end of the bell crank lever may be linked to the pivot, which is normally a roller running along the beam, by a simple connecting rod or lever.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a full power load sensing valve adapted for use with a hydro pneumatic suspension system Figure 2 is a cross section taken on in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section taken on BB in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross section taken on CC in Figure 2 and Figures 5 and 6 show an alternative embodiment of a loadsensing valve according to the invention. The load sensing valve body 10 houses a stirrup brake valve 12 of the kind described in our earlier British Patent SpecificationNo. 1 420 680 which is connected through a balancing beam mechanism 14 to an actuator 16. The mechanism 14 comprises two parallel balancing beams 15 pivoted on rollers 18 having a common axle 19. The position of the rollers being adjustable to vary the ratio of the pressure output at delivery port 20 to the brake valve input pressure which is applied at port 22.Adjustment of the pivot position is achieved by means of actuator 24 which is sensitive to the vehicle suspension loading. Pressure signals from the left and right side suspension struts not shown are applied to signal ports 26 and 28 in the actuator 24 housing 30, and act respectively on areas 32 and 34 of an actuator rod or piston 36, displacement of the actuator rod 36, in opposition to adjustable graduating springs 38 acting on ends of a transverse pin or rod 40 fixed to the actuator rod 36, being proportional to the average suspension loading.The graduating springs 38 are adjustable by means of screwed spring anchors 42 running in parallel bores 44 and locked in position by screwed blanking plugs 46.The displacement of the actuator rod 36 is transferred to the balance beam pivot by a linkage the output displacement of which bears a non linear relationship with its input and selected to compensate for existing non linearities so as to produce for a given input pressure a substantially linear relationship between the suspension pressure i.e. the load and the brake valve output pressure. This linkage comprises two bell crank levers 45 one end of which is bifurcated to engage the transverse rod 40 and connecting rods 48 each pivoted at one end to one of the bell crank levers 45 and at the other end to the axle of the associated roller.In an Ã…alternative embodiment shown in Figures 5 and 6, a single graduating spring 50 may be mounted externally around the actuator housing 30 and acts between a screwed ring 52, the position of which can be adjusted by hand, and a cage 54 secured at its upper end to the transverse pin or rod 40. The ends of which extend through slots in the valve body 10. The pivot adjusting mechanism described above enables a theoretical linearity error of only 3 over a range of pressure ratios output input ranging from 1 1 to 4.5 1. By comparison a typical known air pressure valve operating upon a similar principle but without a linkage between the travel actuator and the balance beam pivot has a theoretical linearity error of 25 over the same pressure ratios. In the above described embodiments, the input actuator is operated hydraulically but this is not essential. The input actuator may be driven, in response to variations in the applied load, by any suitable means which may, for example, constitute or comprise pneumatic, electrical, mechanical or hydraulic elements or any combination thereof.
