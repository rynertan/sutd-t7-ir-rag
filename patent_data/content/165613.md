## Description
This invention relates to a process for effectively cultivating microorganisms containing therein desired genes obtained from animals, plants and microorganisms so as to produce a product from the desired genes in large amounts. Recently, there has been developed a gene recombination technique for producing a large amount of a useful substance by using a host microorganism containing a hybrid plasmid obtained by inserting a gene encoding the useful substance into a vector plasmid of the host microorganism. By this technique, human interferon, insulin, etc. are produced. As the host microorganism, But a process for industrially producing the desired product in large amounts by using a host microorganism maintaining the desired gene has not been developed yet. Thus, it has been desired to develop a process for cultivating effectively the microorganism harboring hybrid plasmids. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for increasing the production of a desired protein in a recombinant host containing a plasmid vector carrying the gene encoding the protein under the control of a promoter, characterized by culturing Escherichia coli, containing as promotor a trp promoter, a lac promoter or a tac promoter, and adding an inducer and a nutriment simultaneously to the culture medium at the time when the nutriment originally present in the culture is almost exhausted, wherein the consumption of nutriment is measured by a dissolved oxygen concentration. According to a special embodiment, the process carried through in using as the inducing substance 3 β indolylacrylic acid or isopropyl β D thiogalactoside. According to another special embodiment, the process is carried through wherein the nutriment is casamino acid, glucose, amino acids other than tryptophan, yeast extract, or a mixture thereof. According to a further embodiment, the process is carried through wherein the consumption of nitriment is carried out by adding a repressing substance to the culture medium at an initial stage of the culture. Finally, it is a preferred embodiment to use as the repressing substance tryptophan. Fig. 1 shows a structure of hybrid plasmid pTREZ1.

Fig. 8 is a graph showing a relationship between the amount of tryptophan and the β galactosidase produced. As the promoter for expressing the desired gene, there can be used a trp tryptophan promoter, a lac promoter Nature, As the hybrid plasmid obtained by ligating a trp promoter and β galactosidase gene, there can be used hybrid plasmid pTREZ1 having the structure shown in Fig. 1. The hybrid plasmid pTREZ1 can be obtained from plasmid pTRE1 and pMC1403. The plasmid pTRE1 containing a trp promoter is obtained by inserting a DNA fragment of about 500 bp base pairs containing a promoter of trp operon of On the other hand, as the β galactosidase gene, plasmid pMC1403 J. Bacteriol, Fig. 3 shows a process for constructing plasmid pTREZ1 wherein the β galactosidase gene is connected at the downstream of trp promoter. The hybrid plasmid pTREZ1 of 10.21 kb can be constructed by ligating the DNA fragment of 4.21 kb containing the trp promoter cut from the plasmid pTRE1 and the β galactosidase gene of 6.2 kb cut from the plasmid pMC1403 with T₄ DNA ligase. As the microorganism harboring the hybrid plasmid comprising a desired gene, a vector and a promoter in its cell and having the ability to express the desired gene, there can be used various Microorganisms other than According to this invention, the microorganism containing a hybrid plasmid comprising a desired gene, a vector and a promoter in its cell and having the ability to express the desired gene, for example, a microorganism for producing β galactosidase, is used for expressing the desired gene so as to produce its product, for example, β galactosidase, with high efficiency. In order to control the culture of the recombinant, the recombinant is supplied to a culture medium for cultivation, and an inducer and a nutiment are added to the culture medium simultaneously at a time when the nutriment in the culture medium is almost consumed. As the inducer, 3 β indolylacrylic acid IA for the trp promoter, isopropyl β D thiogalactoside IPTG for the lac promoter and tac promoter, etc. can be used. As the nutriment, there can be used casamino acid which is a mixture of amino acids, glucose, amino acids other than tryptophan, yeast extract, and a mixture thereof. Among them, the use of casamino acid is preferable. The time when almost all the nutriment in the culture medium is consumed can be judged by a point when the microorganism concentration shows a maximum value, a point when the concentration of glucose becomes almost zero, a point when the concentration of dissolved oxygen DO in the culture medium is changed from a decrease to an increase, and the like. In the case of the hybrid plasmid containing a trp promoter, it is known that a gene is expressed by adding 3 β indolylacrylic acid IA as an inducer during the culture Nature, vol 291, pp 503 506, 1981 . That is, since a repressor which suppress the transcription of the gene is inactivated by IA, the synthesis of mRNA by RNA polymerase begins. In the case of trp promoter, when the inducer IA is added, the promoter begins to function. It is very important in the production of the product of desired gene when the inducer should be added. As to the adding time of IA, a method of the addition at one hour from the beginning of the culture is disclosed in Nature, vol. 29, 503 506, 1981 and a method of using the microorganism concentration as an indicator is disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 141796 83. But these methods are insufficient for industrial culture. One method of this invention is to add the inducer such as IA using the change of DO concentration as an indicator in order to make possible the addition of the inducer suitable for physiologically active state of the microorganism. When microorganisms are cultivated under constant conditions of agitation speed and air flow rate, the DO concentration decreases with the multiplication, and thus the glucose concentration in a substrate decreases due to the consumption by the microorganisms. Then, there takes place a rapid increase in the DO concentration at the time when the substrate is consumed. When the inducer such as IA and a nutriment which can be a synthesis material for the desired product such as β galactosidase are added simultaneously to the culture medium at that time, the desired product such as β galactosidase can be produced in large amounts. That is, by the addition of IA and the nutriment at the time of termination of multiplication of the microorganism due to the consumption of substrate, it becomes possible to begin the production of β galactosidase at the maximum microorganism concentration. The amount of the inducer to be added together with the nutriment is preferably 10 to 30 µg ml, more preferably 15 µg ml. Fig. 4 shows a relationship between the β galactosidase produced amount and the adding amount of IA. As is clear from Fig. 4, the best result is obtained when 15 µg ml of IA is added. This means that the addition of 10 to 30 µg ml of IA together with the nutriment during the culture gives satisfactory results. As the nutriment, casamino acid is most effective as shown in Table 1. When glucose is used, the production of β galactosidase is lowered. Since casamino acid is a mixture of amino acids, the same results can be obtained by adding amino acids other than tryptophan e.g. glycine, glutamic acid, alanine, etc. or a mixture thereof. The produced amount increases when a larger amount of casamino acid is added, but it requires a longer culture time. In the above, the explanation was made as to the hybrid plasmid containing a trp promoter, but the same thing can be applied to the case of hybrid plasmids containing a lac promoter or a tac promoter and isopropyl β D thiogalactoside IPTG being added as an inducer. The above mentioned culture controlling process, that is, a process for increasing the production of desired gene production by adding the inducer and the nutriment simultaneously to the culture medium at the time of the increase of dissolved oxygen DO concentration, is not known in conventional culture processes of recombinants and ordinary microorganisms, and is found for the first time by the present inventors. Fig. 5 shows one example of apparatus suitable for practicing the present invention. In Fig. 5, a culture medium and seed microorganism are placed in a culture tank 1, wherein a recombinant is cultivated while blowing air into the culture tank 1 through a pipe 12 and stirring a culture solution with a stirrer 2. The dissolved oxygen concentration of the culture solution is measured by using a dissolved oxygen sensor 11 step up to the culture tank 1 and a dissolved oxygen meter 10. The measured data are input to an electronic computer for controlling 3 to watch the change of dissolved oxygen concentration. When the dissolved oxygen concentration increases rapidly, signals are input to fixed displacement pumps 6 and 7 so as to supply a nutriment such as casamino acid from a substrate tank 4 and an inducer such as IA from an adding tank 5 in predetermined amounts at the same time to the culture tank 1. The cultivation is continued for a predetermined time, the microorganisms in the culture solution are recovered, and the desired useful substance such as β galactosidase produced in the microorganisms is separated and purified. In Fig. 5, numerals 8 and 9 are pipes. As a means for consuming the nutriment present in the culture medium from the beginning, it is possible to add a repressing substance to the culture medium at the initial stage of the culture. That is, the expression of genes is controlled by a gene region called a promoter operator . In the case of trp promoter, an RNA polymerase is linked to a trp promoter and transferred to the downstream of the promoter to transcript the DNA base sequence so as to synthesize RNA. A polypeptide is synthesized by translation of the information of the synthesized RNA by a ribosome. On the other hand, when the tryptophan concentration in a cell increases, tryptophan binds to a repressor to activate it, and the repressor binds to a region called an operator . As a result, the RNA polymerase cannot bind to the promoter portion. The production of polypeptide terminates due to no synthesis of RNA. In such a case, tryptophan acts as a repressing substance. This invention also provides a process for producing a polypeptide, e.g., β galactosidase, effectively by controlling the trp promoter. For example, when In order to increase the produced amount of β galactosidase, a small amount of tryptophan which is a repressing substance is added at the initial stage of culture to suppress the action of trp promoter and to lower the production of β galactosidase so as to multiply the microorganisms. The amount of tryptophan to be added is preferably 2.5 to 10 µg ml, more preferably about 5 µg ml. When the content of nutriment in the culture medium is remarkably lowered or becomes zero, an inducer such as IA which initiates the action of trp promoter is added to the culture solution together with a nutriment so as to activate the trp promoter and so as to make The culture process applying the trp promoter expression controlling mechanism and attaining separately the microorganism multiplication and the β galactosidase production is not known in this art. This invention is illustrated by way of the following Examples. Since the dissolved oxygen DO concentration was rapidly increased after about 1.5 hours culture as shown in Fig. 6, 15 µg ml of IA and 2.5 mg ml of casamino acid were added simultaneously. The β galactosidase produced at the time of simultaneous addition of IA and casamino acid was 16.6 U ml, but increased to 21.8 U ml which value is about 1.3 times as large as the value of 16.6 U ml after 6 hours culture. After the addition of IA and casamino acid, the microorganism concentration hardly increased it seems that almost all the casamino acid added is consumed for the production of β galactosidase. From the above mentioned results, it is clear that the β galactosidase produced amount can remarkably be increased by the simultaneous addition of IA and casamino acid using the DO concentration as an indicator. The procedures of Example 1 were repeated except for adding only 2.5 mg ml of casamino acid at the time of increase of the DO concentration. Since the DO concentration was rapidly increased after about 1.5 hours culture as shown in Fig. 7, 2.5 mg ml of casamino acid alone was added to the culture solution. In this case, the β galactosidase produced and the microorganism concentration were hardly increased after the addition of casamino acid. This means that the addition of IA is necessary for improving the production of β galactosidase. On a plate of L broth culture medium tryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, glucose 1 g, NaCl 5 g, city water 1 liter, pH 7.2 containing 50 µg ml of ampicillin, After the culture, to each 1 ml of culture medium was added 15 µl of toluene and the cultures were shaken at 37 C for 30 minutes. After shaking, the culture medium was diluted 10 to 100 times in order to measure the produced amount of β galactosidase. One ml of the solution was taken out and shaked at 30 C for 5 minutes, followed by addition of 3.5 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.25 and 0.5 ml of 0.01 M O nitrophenyl β D galactopyranoside ONPG and 10 minutes shaking. After sampling 1 ml of the solution and stopping the reaction by placing it in 1 M Na₂CO₃, 8 ml of water was added thereto so as to make the whole amount 10 ml. The absorbance of this sample was measured at 420 nm by using a spectrophotometer. The amount of O nitrophenol ONP produced was calculated from the standard curves of ONT. In this case, the β galactosidase activity for decomposing 1 µmole of ONPG per minute was defined as one unit U . The results are shown in Fig. 8. At 2 hours from the beginning of culture curve 1 , the β galactosidase produced amount is decreased with an increase of the adding amount of tryptophan, since the action of trp promoter is suppressed by the addition of tryptophan. But as shown in the curve 2 wherein IA and casamino acid are added after 2 hours culture followed by 3 hours additional culture, the β galactosidase produced shows a maximum value at the addition of 5 µg ml of tryptophan, the value being 10 as large as the case of adding no tryptophan. As mentioned above, the addition of tryptophan which is a repressing substance for a trp promoter at an initial stage of the culture, followed by the addition of an inducer and a nutriment at the time when almost the nutriment initially present in the culture medium is consumed, is effective for remarkably improving the production of β galactosidase. According to this invention, the suppression and induction of the production of desired products can be conducted as desired in the culture of recombinants, and thus industrial production of the desired products by using the microorganisms harboring hybrid plasmids can be carried out with high efficiency.
