# Graphics generator.

## Abstract
A microprocessor based data processing system includ ing a microprocessor 40 , a memory unit 42 , and a display unit 22 is provided with a programmable graphics gener ator 44 that transfers graphics information from the memory unit 42 to the display unit 22 in response to and under the control of a set of display instructions also stored in the memory unit 42 . The graphics generator 44 includes a first addressing unit 82 for sequentially accessing the display instructions from the memory unit 42 a control unit 88,90 for receiving, storing and decoding such instruction and for issuing supervisory and control signals in response to the binary state of each instruction a second addressing unit 84 for accessing graphics information from the mem ory unit 42 in response to the supervisory signals from the control unit 88,90 and a third addressing unit 86 for accessing movable object graphics stored in the memory unit 42 . A movable object generator section 44B of the programmable generator 44 includes circuit elements 140 for determining the horizontal position of the movable object only the vertical position of the object displayed is modified by rewriting the picture data of the object at a new location within a block 288a to 288e of graphics information corres ponding to each movable object. The entire block of graphics information, including the picture data of the object, is communicated to the display unit 22 and displayed as a vertical column 430 to 440 . Also disclosed is a method and apparatus for formating and transferring the graphics infor mation is sequentially ordered bytes so that binary states of each byte select the color and luminance characteristics used to display each byte of graphic information. Additional features of the invention include a sound generator 46 capable of selectively providing a plurality of audio signals.
