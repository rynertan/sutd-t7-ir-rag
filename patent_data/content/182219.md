# Severing of tubes in steam generator.

## Abstract
Apparatus for severing primary tubes 47 of steam gene rator of a nuclear reactor. The tubes are under water because they are radioactive and also because it is undesirable to ex pose the tubes to oxidation. The tubes are in a confined region of the steam generator affording limited access for cutting. The apparatus includes a cutting file 81 whose cutting sur face is circular. The file is located wholly outside the tube in the region where the tube is clamped within cooperative clamps 105, 141 which secure the tube for cutting. The file is rotated in cutting engagement with the tube by an air motor 113 . The file is mounted on a slider 97 which is pulled by a cable 109 causing the file to cut through the tube.
