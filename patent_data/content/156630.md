## Description
ARTHROPODICIDAL COMPOUNDS, THEIR MANUFACTURE AND USES IN COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to new compounds having arthropodicidal activity, to methods of preparing these compounds and to the use of the compounds as arthropodicides, especially as insecticides and acaricides. Various arthropodicidal compounds are known and a particularly valuable class of them are the pyrethroid type insecticides, which may be naturally occurring or, more usually, synthetic. Disclosures of various pyrethroid type insecticides exist in, for instance, Australian Patents 503590, 530169 and 525002. Much research has been devoted to producing arthropodicidal compounds of increased activity, for instance by selection of appropriate isomers and by appropriate substitution in various positions in the molecules. We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to increase the activity of an arthropodicidal compound by substituting at least 1 deuterium atom for a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom in the structure of the compound. Thus novel compounds of the invention are arthropodicidal compounds wherein there is at least one deuterium atom substituted onto a carbon atom. The preferred compounds of the invention have the general formula I EMI1.1 wherein A represents any group which in association with the remainder of the molecule gives arthropodicidal activity and which may contain a deuterium atom in place of any hydrogen atom which is attached to a carbon atom having four separate bonds Y is O, S, CH2, or NH R is hydrogen or deuterium, R is hydrogen, deuterium, cH, C CH or C CD and R is hydrogen or fluorine provided that the compound contains at least one deuterium atom. Typically, ACOO represents the acid moiety of a known pyrethroid type insecticide. Well known structures for A that give arthropodicidal compounds of Formula I are as follows EMI3.1 wherein RÚ is a halo group or a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or lower alkylthio group, in each of which the alkyl group may be substituted with one or more halo groups Rut is hydrogen or a halo or malomethyl group or R 2 and R2 together form a methylenedioxy, or a difluoro methylenedioxy group or, Rl and R2 together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form an aromatic ring wherein any hydrogen atom in RÚ or Rê may be replaced by deuterium X and X are the same or different and are selected from chloro, fluoro, bromo, methyl or trifluoromethyl W and W are the same or different and each is hydrogen or deuterium ZI, z2, z3, z4, z5 and z6 are the same or different and are selected from fluoro, chloro, bromo, hydrogen, deuterium, CH3, CH2X, CHX2 and CX3 wherein X is as defined above. The insecticidal activity of pyrethroid esters is limited by degradation of the compounds within the insect. This is manifested as recovery of the insect after initial knockdown or by larger than expected lethal doses. Although the addition of mixed function oxidase inhibitors as synergists gives significant but unpredictable increases in activity of pyrethroids, degradation still limits their activity. In an attempt to decrease biodegradation of pyrethroids, protons on various positions of pyrethroid esters particularly those of our Australian Patents 502,950, 530,169 and 525,002 were replaced by deuterium. We discovered that deuteration significantly increased activity. We also discovered that a wide range of acids when esterified by the alcohols ofFormula II give esters with significantly increased activity compared to the corresponding non deuterated esters. This effect holds also for optical isomers of these esters.EMI5.1 The compounds of formula II, including its isomeric and racemic forms, where Y, R , R and R are as defined above are novel and constitute a separate aspect of this invention. The compounds of the invention formula I are optically active and can be resolved into their optical isomers by conventional methods. The invention thus includes the individual optical isomers of the compounds as well as the racemic forms. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by the conventional methods of synthetic organic chemistry. In general, the compounds are formed by reacting together the alcohol of formula 11 or a reactive derivative thereof with the appropriate acid ACOOH where A is as defined above or a reactive derivative thereof. The active compounds of the invention are well tolerated by plants, have a favourable level of toxicity to warm blooded animals, and can be used for combating arthropod pests, especially insects or acarids, which are encountered in agriculture, in veterinary practice, in forestry, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene field. They are active against normally sensitive and resistant species and against all or some stages of development. The abovernentioned pests include Lucilia cuprina theAustralian sheep blowfly , Blatella germanica German cockroach , Periplaneta americana American cockroach and Heliothis punctigera cotton budworm . The present invention also provides arthropodicial compositions containing as active ingredients a compound of the present invention. The present invention also provides a method of combating arthropods especially insects or acarids which comprises applying to the arthropods, or to a habitat thereof, a compound of the present invention alone or in the form of a composition containing as active ingredient a compound of the present invention. The present invention also provides a method of freeing or protecting domesticated animals from parasitical insects or acarids which comprises applying to said animals a compound according to the present invention, or a composition containing such a compound as the active ingredient. In the compositions of this invention, the active compounds are converted into such customary formulations as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspens ions, powders, dusting agents, foams, pastes, soluble powders, granules, aerosols, suspension emulsion concentrates, seed treatment powders, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, very fine capsules in polymeric substances, and coating compositions for use on seed, as well as ULV cold mist and warm mist formulations. These formulations may be produced in known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, i.e., liquid or liquefied gaseous or solid diluents or carriers, optionally with the use of surface active agents, i.e., emulsifying agents and or dispersing agents and or foam forming agents. Where water is used as an extender, auxiliary solvents, such as for example, organic solvents, can also be used. Examples of suitable liquid diluents or carriers, especially solvents, are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkyl naphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone and strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as well as water. By liquefied gaseous diluents or carriers are meant liquids which would be gaseous at normal temperature and under normal pressure, for example aerosol propellants, such as halogenated hydrocarbons as well as butane, propaner nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Examples of solid carriers are ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly dispersed silicic acid, alumina and silicates. As solid carriers for granules there may be used crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Examples of emulsifying and or foam forming agents are non ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxy ethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkyl sulphonates, alkyl sulphates, aryl sulphonates, as well as albumin hydrolysis products. Dispersing agents include, for example, lignin sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, can be used in the formulations. It is also possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs. The formulations in general will contain from 0.1 to 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably from 0.5 to 90 per cent by weight. The active compounds according to the invention may be used in the form of formulations of the types that are commercially available or in the use forms prepared from these formulations. The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the formulations of the types that are commercially available can vary within wide ranges. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 100 by weight of active compound, preferably from 0.0001 to 10 by weight. The compounds may be employed in a customary manner appropriate for the particular use forms. The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for combating ectoparasites and endoparasites in the field of veterinary medicine. The compounds may be used in a known manner, such as orally in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drenches and granules dermally by means of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on and powdering. The compounds may be employed either as the sole toxic agent in compositions such as those described above, or in combination with other anthropodicides, especially insecticides, such as pyrethrum, rotenone, or with fungicidal or bactericidal agents, to provide compositions useful for household and agricultural dusts and sprays, textile coating and impregnation, and the like. In particular, the compounds of the invention may be advantageously combined with other substances which have a synergistic or potentiating action. Generally such substances are of the class of microsomal oxidase inhibitors, i.e., they inhibit the detoxification of insecticides in insects produced by the action of oxidative enzymes.Typical substances of this type are the pyrethrin synergists of which the following are examples 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethoxyj 4, 5 methylenedioxy 2 propyltoluene Piperonyl butoxide , 3 hexyl 5 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl 2 cyclohexanone Piperonyl cyclonene , 2 3,4 methylenedioxy phenoxy 3,6,9 trioxaundecane Sesoxane or Sesamex , 1,2 methylene dioxy 4 2 octylsulfinyl propylibenzene Sulfoxide , dipropyl 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 7 methylnaphtho 2,3 d , 3 dioxole 5,6 dicarboxylate n Propyl isome , as well as propynyl ethers and propynyl oximes. Sesoxane , Sesamex and Sulphoxidel are Registered Trade Marks . Piperonyl butoxide is particularly useful as a potentiator. The amount of piperonyl butoxide used may vary from 1 100th to fifty times the weight of the compound I the preferred range being from about 1 100th to five parts by weight. Sesamex also is a useful potentiator in similar amounts. The following general methods were used to prepare the compounds described in the Examples which follow. A. Formation of Deuterated Compound by Esterification The appropriate acid 2 mmol is ref fluxed with thionyl chloride 4 mmol, 0.5g , on a steam bath for I hour and then evaporated to dryness to remove excess thionyl chloride and leave the acid chloride as an oil. This oil was dissolved in sodium dried benzene 5 ml and pyridine 2 mmol, 0.24g added, followed in 5 minutes by the appropriate deuterated alcohol 2 mmdl . The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature overnight, after which it is diluted with diethyl ether 20 ml , filtered and evaporated to dryness. The crude ester, usually a yellow viscous oil, was purified by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC using petroleum spirit 600 800C ethylacetate as the eluting solvents. B. Preparation of substituted Dideuteromethanol compounds The appropriately substituted aromatic carboxylic acid 0.1 nimol is reacted with thionyl chloride 0.2 mmol on a steam bath for 2 hours and the solution evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in dry diethyl ether and added over I hour to a slurry of lithiur aluminium deuteride Ig in 100ml of dry ether. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 10 C. At the completion of the addition the reaction mixture is warmed to a gentle reflux for 4 hours, then allowed to stand overnight at room terperature. Water is added dropwise to decompose excess LiAlD4 then the mixture is acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid. The aqueous and ether layers are separated, the aqueous layer washed with ether and the ether solutions combined. The ether extract is washed with water, dilute sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over Na2SO. The ether is evaporated from the dried extract to give an oil which is the desired product.EMI12.1 See Example l a for a specific example of this reaction. C. Preparation of Substituted l d Drop 2 yn i d compoundsEMI13.1 Concentrated hydrochloric acid 3 ml and water 2 ml is placed in a stirred flask and chromium trioxide 2.5g added. The Cr03 solution is cooled in an ice bath and pyridine added dropwise over 15 minutes. The orange coloured precipitate which forms is filtered and dried under vacuum to give a light brown solid. This pyridinium chlorochromate is slurried in 20 ml. of methylene chloride and the appropriate substituted dideuteromethanol 2.56g is added at room temperature.After 3 hours the solution is decanted off and the residue washed with further portions of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride solutions are combined and chromatographed on a short silica column to give an oil. This is distilled at 1 10 Torr, to yield the deuteroaldehyde as a colourless oil. Ethyl bromide 2.61g and magnesium powder 0.58g are reacted together in 10 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran to form a Grignard reagent solution. In a separate flask acetylene is bubbled through 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran cooled in ice. The Grignard reagent solution is added to this over 30 minutes and acetylene addition maintained for a further 2 hours.The deuteroaldehyde prepared above is dissolved in THF 5 ml and added to the ice cold solution over 15 minutes. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight.A solution of ammonium chloride l.28g in 5 ml H20 is added dropwise to the reaction vessel to decompose excess Grignard reagent. Water is then added and the reaction mixture transferred to a separating funnel.The aqueous layer is extracted with ether. T he.organic extracts are combined, washed with water and dried overNa2SO4. After removal of solvents form the dried extracts a yellow viscous oil remains. Separation of this by HPLC gives a pale yellow oil, whose structure can be determined by proton nmr.See examples 1 b and l c for a specific example of this preparation.D.
