# Coaxial joints.

## Abstract
A coaxial joint for joining inner and outer cylindrical members 2, 3 permitting rotational and or linear movement between them, comprises an outer bushing sleeve 4 non rotatably receivable within the outer cylindrical member 3 an inner bushing sleeve 5 formed with a central bore 51 for receiving the inner cylindrical member 2 a first group of longitudinally extending, circumferentially spaced ribs 41 formed between the inner and outer sleeves 5, 4 and a second group of such ribs 42 formed in staggered relation ship with respect to the first group on the outer face of the sleeve 4 and effective, when forcibly received within the outer cylindrical member, 3 to distort inwardly the portions of the outer slleve 4 between the first group of ribs 41 and thereby to minimize the distortion of the inner sleeve 5 .
