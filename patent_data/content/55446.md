# Method for production of polyolefins which form articles having fewer gel discontinuities.

## Abstract
An improved process for polymerizing olefins in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst and hydrogen for molecular weight control is achieved by adding additional hydrogen to the polymer slurry produced in the reactor system to reduce the formation of gel discontinuities in articles fabricated from the resultant polymer.
