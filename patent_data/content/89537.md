# Improved ballistic resistant article.

## Abstract
Articles such as vests, helmets and structural elements containing a network of ultrahigh molecular weight, high strength, high modulus polyethylene or polypropylene fi bers. The fibers, and especially polyethylene fibers of 15, 20, 25, 30 or more g denier tenacity, and 300, 500, 1000, 1500 or more g denier tensile modulus impart exceptional ballistic resistance to the articles in spite of the melting points, e.g. 145 151 C for the polyethylene fibers and 168 171 C for the polypropylene fibers, which are high for these polymers, but substantially lower than the 200 C or more melting point previously thought necessary for good ballistic resistance.
