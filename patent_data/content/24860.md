## Description
DUAL STANDARD TELEVISION VERTICAL DEFLECTION SYSTEM This invention relates to dual standard television receivers and in particular to a television receiver arrangement in which vertical deflection circuit parameters are automatically adjusted in dependence upon the scanning standards of the television signal being received so that the receiver may present a proper image display in response to signals of differing scanning standards. With the advent of home video tape players and video disc players, there is an increased diversity of program sources available for supply of image information to a television receiver. If the receiver is provided with the facility for proper image display in response to television signals developed under differing scanning standards, the flexibility of use of the receiver is enhanced.Of main concern, in this regard, is the ability to provide proper image display in response to a television signals of the type having a line frequency of 15,625 Hz. and a field frequency of 50 Hz., and b television signals of the type having a line frequency of approximately 15,750 Hz.and a field frequency of approximately 60 Hz. the latter type being viewed as inclusive of signals of the type where line frequency is particularly 15,734.26 Hz. and field frequency is particularly 59.94 Hz. . Most commercially available single standard television receivers designed for normal operation in response to signals of type a above, when supplied with signals of type b , operate as follows 1 in view of the close similarity of line frequencies, properly synchronized operation of the receiver s horizontal deflection system is achieved, and image display is effected with proper picture width 2 properly synchronized operation of the receiver s vertical deflection system is achieved, but image display is effected with an objectionable reduction in picture height of the order of 10 to 208 . In others of such commercially available receivers, the picture height reduction problem is accompanied by occasional inability to achieve properly timed vertical triggering with the latter problem subject to remedy by vertical hold adjustment, but only if such a facility is incorporated in the receiver design . The present invention automatically effects deflection circuit parameter adjustments in appropriate dependence upon the scanning standards of the signal being received. Thus, the receiver properly synchronizes image displays of proper picture dimensions in response to signals of differing scanning standards. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the receiver arrangement includes means for identifying the field frequency of the received signals, and means responsive to the output of the field frequency identifying means for altering the circuitry of the vertical deflection system in a manner appropriate to ensuring development of a properly synchronized image display of a desired picture height for received signals of differing field frequencies. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, an image display system alternatively displays images in response to composite video signals having a first field frequency and inclusive of vertical synchronizing pulses having a first repetition rate corresponding to said first field frequency or displays images in response to composite video signals having a second field frequency higher than the first field frequency and inclusive of vertical synchronizing pulses having a second repetition rate corresponding to the second field frequency.In such a display system, a vertical deflection system comprises a vertical deflection winding,and means subject to synchronization by the vertical synchronizing pulses of composite video signals applied to the image display system,for developing vertical scanning current waves for passage through the deflection winding. The current waves have a fundamental frequency corresponding to the repetition rate of the vertical synchronizing pulses effecting synchronization of the developing means. Identifying means responsive to the field frequency of the applied composite video signals develop an output voltage of a first level, when the applied composite video signals have the first field frequency.The identifying means develop an output voltage of a second level, different from the first level, when the applied composite video signals have a second field frequency. A switching device responsive to the output voltage of the identifying means exhibits a first switching state when the output voltage is at the first level and exhibits a second switching state when the output voltage is at the second level.Means responsive to the switching state of the switching device alters a current wave amplitude controlling parameter of the developing means in dependence upon the switching state, in such a manner that the amplitude of the current waves developed during synchronization of the developing means by pulses of the first repetition rate substantially matches the amplitude of the current waves developed during synchronization of the developing means by pulses of the second repetition rate. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a tone decoder phase locked loop PLL is rendered responsive to the voltage developed across a sampling resistor in the path of the receiver s vertical scanning current. The PLL is tuned to exhibit a first output state when the fundamental frequency of the vertical deflection sawtooth waveform variations corresponds to the 50 Hz. field frequency of signals of type a above, and to exhibit a second output state when the fundamental frequency of the vertical deflection sawtooth waveform variations corresponds to the 60 Hz. field frequency of signals of type b above. A switch is associated with elements forming the capacitor charging impedance of a sawtooth wave generator whose output controls the timing and amplitude of the sawtooth current waves energizing the vertical deflection windings.The switching state of the switch is rendered responsive to the PLL output state in such manner that when the lower 50 Hz. field frequency is identified, the effective charging impedance is of a given magnitude, whereas, when the higher 60 Hz. field frequency is identified, the effective charging impedance is altered to a second magnitude, lower than said given magnitude.With proper proportioning of the respective impedance magnitudes, the amplitude of the sawtooth generator output at the higher triggering rate substantially matches the amplitude of the sawtooth generator output at the lower triggering rate. Advantageously, this technique of amplitude control can also effect an appropriate alteration in the freerunning frequency of a vertical oscillator regeneratively associated with the capacitor charging circuit, whereby reliable synchronization of the oscillator by vertical synchronizing pulses at the respective field frequencies can be assured. In the sole figure of the accompanying drawing, there is shown, partially schematically and partially by block representation, a dual standard television receiver vertical deflection system incorporating parameter control apparatus embodying the principles of the present invention. In the illustrated vertical deflection circuitry, a vertical oscillator 47 comprises a capacitor charging circuit which includes a first charging resistor 43, a second charging resistor 41, a capacitor 45, and a capacitor 50, serially connected in the order named between the positive terminal V1 and the negative terminal illustratively, ground of a unidirectional voltage supply. A discharging path for the capacitors includes the series combination of a small value resistor 37, the emitter to collector path of a PNP discharge transistor 34, and the base to emitter path of an NPN transistor 35, with the series combination connected between the junction 40 of resistor 41 and capacitor 45 and ground. Biasing for the base of transistor 34 is provided by a voltage divider formed by resistors 31 and 33, serially connected between the V1 terminal and ground, with the junction 30 of the resistors directly connected to the base of transistor 34. Regenerative coupling of transistors 34 and 35 is provided via a resistor 36 connected between the collector of transistor 35 and the base of transistor 34. Resistor 33 is shunted by the series combination of a resistor 27 and the collector to emitter path of an NPN transistor 26, which receives, at its base, positive going vertical synchronizing pulses derived from a composite video signal received by the receiver s sync separator circuitry not shown . An NPN transistor 44 is connected as an emitterfollower, with its collector connected to the V supply terminal, its base directly connected to the junction 42 of charging resistors 43 and 41, and its emitter returned to ground via serially connected resistors 51 and 53. For conventional S correction purposes, an additional charging path for capacitor 50 is provided via a resistor 46 connected between the emitter of transistor 44 and the junction of capacitors 45 and 50. The junction 52 of resistors 51 and 53 provides a takeoff point for an input to the receiver s vertical blanking circuitry not shown . The output of emitter follower connected transistor 44 is coupled via resistor 65 to the base of an NPN transistor 64, connected as an emitter follower, with its collector connected to the V1 supply terminal and its emitter returned to ground via a resistor 71, shunted by a capacitor 70. The emitter of transistor 64 provides a takeoff point for an input to the receiver s east west side pincushion correction circuits not shown . An output emitter follower is formed by an NPN transistor 67, with its base directly connected to the emitter of transistor 64,with its collector connected to the V1 supply terminal, and with its emitter returned to ground via the series combination of the resistive element of a height control potentiometer 73 and a resistor 74. At the adjustable tap of potentiometer 73 appears an S corrected sawtooth wave of adjustable magnitude, which is delivered to an input terminal 75 of the vertical deflection winding drive circuit 13 for which schematic details are not shown . The drive circuit 13 supplies an output current controlled in timing, waveshape, and amplitude by the input at terminal 75 to the series combination of the vertical deflection windings 17 of the receiver s deflection yoke and a vertical scanning current sampling resistor 76. Feedback of the voltage across resistor 76 to drive circuit 13, for conventional linearizing purposes, is provided via a feedback resistor 112. The circuitry of the illustrated vertical deflection system, as thus far described, is of a conventional form. The charging circuit elements 43, 41, 45, 50 cooperate with elements 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 in a regenerative fashion to form a vertical oscillator 47 Illustratively, the free running frequency of the oscillator 47 is less than 50Hz. e.g., 43 Hz. , and is readily subject to synchronized operation at 50 Hz., when vertical synchronizing pulses from a signal of type a above are supplied to transistor 26. Between synchronizing pulses, transistors 34 and 35 are non conducting, and capacitors 45 and 50 are charged via resistors 43 and 41 in series.When a sync pulse causes transistor 26 to conduct, transistor 34 is biased into conduction turning on transistor 35 which latches transistor 34 in a conducting mode.Discharge of capacitors 45 and 5 via discharge path elements 37, 34, 35 continues until the potential at junction 40 drops sufficiently to cut off transistor 34. The charging portion of the cycle then recommences. Now to be described are the additional circuit elements of the illustrated system which provide the vertical deflection circuitry with its desired dual standard capabilities. A tone decoder phase locked loop PLL 15 of a conventional design receives as an input via the series combination of a resistor 84 and capacitor 85 the voltage across the scanning current sampling resistor 76. For illustrative schematic details, PLL 15 is shown as employing a Signetics Type NE567 integrated circuit with external circuit connections, as follows respective capacitors 91, 93, 94 and 96 linking chip terminals 6, 2, 1 and 4, respectively, to ground chip terminal 7 directly grounded. Chip terminal 4 is connected via zener diode 95 tb the V2 supply terminal resistor 97 interconnects chip terminals 4 and 8 the series combination of variable resistor 87 and resistor 90 interconnects chip terminals 5 and 6.Chip terminal 8, which is the output terminal, is connected to the V2 supply terminal via the series combination of resistors 101 and 100.Chip input terminal 3 accepts the input from sampling resistor 76. Variable resistor 87 is illustratively adjusted to tune PLL 15 to 60 Hz., whereby PLL 15 is activated when the fundamental frequency of the scanning waveform sampled by resistor 76 corresponds to the field frequency approximately 60 Hz. of a signal of type b above. The voltage at chip output terminal 8 goes low under such conditions. In contrast, when the fundamental frequency of the sampled scanning waveform corresponds to the type a field frequency 50 Hz. , PLL 15 is not activated, and the voltage at the chip output terminal 8 goes high. A PNP switching transistor 103 is disposed with its base connected to the junction 102 of the PLL output resistors 100 and 101, with its emitter connected to the V3 supply terminal, and with its collector connected via a resistor 105 to a junction 42 of charging resistors 43 and 41.A resistor 104 shunts the emitter to collector path of transistor 103. If desired, a single source may be used to provide the supplies to the V1, V2 and V3 terminals. When chip terminal 8 goes low, in response to a 60 Hz. signal, transistor 103 is switched into a saturated state, effectively shorting out resistor 104. Under these circumstances, charging resistor 43 is shunted by the impedance of resistor 105 alone. When chip terminal 8 goes high, however, transistor 103 is switched into a nonconducting state, whereby charging resistor 43 is shunted by the higher impedance of the series combination of resistors 104 and 105. Thus, when the vertical oscillator 47 is synchronized for 60 Hz. operation by synchronizing pulses from type b signals, the effective charging impedance in the main charging path for capacitors 45 and 50 is lowered in magnitude relative to the effective charging impedance magnitude presented in the main charging path when the oscillator is synchronized for 50 Hz. operation by synchronizing pulses from type a signals. By proper resistor proportioning, the charging impedance alteration can be made to just compensate for the effect on sawtooth amplitude of the reduction in charging time, whereby the same sawtooth amplitude is obtained for both 50 Hz. and 60 Hz. operation. The charging impedance alteration also has the beneficial effect of raising the free running frequency of the vertical oscillator 47 when shifting from 50 Hz. operation to 60 Hz. operation. With the values of resistors listed below, the free running frequency shift is from 45 Hz. when switching transistor 103 is off, and the series combination of resistors 104, 105 shunts charging resistor 43 to 54 Hz. when switching transistor 103 shorts out resistor 104 .Such a frequency shift assures efficiency of synchronization for both modes of operation, and can avoid undesirable rolling effects that might otherwise accompany a momentary loss of synchronizing information when operating at the higher field frequency. In the embodiment of the invention, described above, the transistor 103 switching system that responds to the field frequency identifier PLL 15 controls charging impedance magnitude to effect the desired sawtooth amplitude compensation. Alternatives to the charging impedance control are possible, including the following 1 controlling the magnitude of the unidirectional charging potential supplied to the charging network 43, 41, 45, 50 as by dropping the V1 supply potential via a dropping resistor during 50 Hz. operation, and shorting the dropping resistor with a switching device during 60 Hz. operation 2 effecting switch control of impedance in shunt or series with the height control potentiometer 73 3 effecting switch control of impedance in shunt or series with the sampling resistor 76 and 4 effecting switch control of impedance in shunt or series with feedback resistor 112. In the use of alternatives 2 , 3 and 4 , it will be noted that amplitude compensation is effected at a point in the system subsequent to pincushion correction drive takeoff. Under such circumstances, optimum drive for the pincushion corrector can be provided for only one of the two field frequency standards. It may also be noted that the advantageous shift of the free running frequency of the vertical oscillator 47 provided by the illustrated embodiment does not accompany the amplitude compensation when effected by alternatives 2 , 3 and 4 . Alternative 1 is less power efficient than the illustrated embodiment. A simple transistor switch will not be sufficient for alternative 4 , which requires a bidirectional switching device e.g., a microrelay . In the illustrated embodiment, sampling resistor 76 provides a convenient, low impedance source of input drive for the field frequency identifying PLL 15. However, when the sampling resistor is used as such a source, the oscillator should be capable of being reliably triggered by the higher frequency synchronizing pulses with transistor 103 in either of its switching states. An alternative source of input drive for PLL 15 comprises the sync separator circuits of the receiver. While use of such an alternative source can assure achievement of field frequency identification with independence of the oscillator locking characteristics, more complex coupling circuitry e.g., inclusive of an impedance transforming stage, such as an emitter follower will typically be required.
