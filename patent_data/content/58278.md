## Abstract
An ultra lightweight, thin link is formed of a strip which is of U shaped section for most of its length and which has end portions in which integral bush bearings 12, 13 are provided by plunged holes 10 and 11 in the strip. The strip is very thin, eg about 0.5 mm, and is formed of non alloy steel having nitrogen diffused through substantially the whole of the section thereof. The nitrogen is in solid solution in a ferritic matrix. Such a structure is obtained by heat treatment in a nitrogen containing atmosphere followed by oil quenching. The strip also has an epsilon iron nitride surface layer 19 thereon in a portion 19b of which oil is absorbed to impart self lubricating properties to the bearings 12, 13 .
