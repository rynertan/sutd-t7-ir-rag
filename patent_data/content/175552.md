# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE MONITORING OF FLUIDS

## Abstract
The invention provides an arrangement for monitoring conditions of a fluid comprising a first station incorporating a detector and transmitter assembly including a plurality of con dition sensors, each of which is adapted to monitor one or more conditions of a fluid, receipt circuits adapted to receive signals from the sensors, a radio transmitter circuit fed from the receipt circuits and a second station incorporating a receiver and out put assembly including a radio decoding circuit for receiving signals from the transmitter circuit, incorporating a sub circuit for separating and deconding signals from each of the condi tions sensors, and a sub circuit for converting these signals to a common voltage range, and an output circuit for translating the signal voltages to appropriate signal values for a visual and or audio output.
