# Method and apparatus for controlling continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
The reduction ratio of a continuously variable transmis sion is controlled by a shift motor. The shift motor is controlled such that each of rotary positions thereof corres ponds uniquely to a desired optimum reduction ratio. Upon detecting a state wherein a rapid shifting is needed, the shift motor is rotated at an increased revolution speed as compared to a normal revolution speed.
