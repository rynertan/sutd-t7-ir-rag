# SYSTEM FOR COMPOSING HEAVY STRUCTURE HOUSES TO DISASSEMBLE

## Abstract
Two floor houses are foreseen consisting of more dwelling units in battery that can be disassembled, on beams on the ground in parallel, employing, for any one of them, a monolithic 3 dimension element in reinforced concrete, already equipped with mechanical, electrical, hydro sanitary and heating plants, as well as with stairs for reaching the second floor and bath rooms on each floor, to which two dimensional elements can be connected for the building completion. The two dimension elements are panels to be carried out by means of either normal or cellular concrete in metal casting resulting from the solidarization of metal profile C65 on the two edges of rim, of walls, in electrically welded net. The system in comparison with the present procedures, which operate by assemblability of 3 dimension elements, enables considerable reduction of costs both of production and of management, reducing the encumbering volume in store and transport as well as the mounting and recovery times.
