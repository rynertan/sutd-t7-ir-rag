# Improvements in or relating to combustors.

## Abstract
A combustor 1 for burning a feedstock includes a cylindrical body 2 having a tangential feedstock inlet 4 and an exhaust outlet 8 . A catchment chamber 22 of hollow cylindrical form intersects the wall of the body 2 and opens into the cavity 14 to provide a common boundary 24 . Swirling or vortical flow is created in the cavity 14 and a secondary vortex is generated and driven within the cham ber 22 by the main flow. In operation contaminant matter is sheared off from the flow in the body 2 into the chamber 22 and is entrapped by the secondary vortex from which it is precipitated. there being no net gas flow across the boundary 24 .
