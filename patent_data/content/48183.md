# INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
The engine block casting includes an exhaust gas passageway 31 extending from an engine cylinder and including near the end thereof remote from the cylinder an enlarged cavity which defines at least a part of a muffler shell 33 . Numerous other elements may be cast integral with the engine block including a boss 79 for attaching a pull rope recoil starter assembly 149, 163 along with an anchoring point 75 for one end of the rewind spring 168 of that starter assembly and retaining guides 77 for the rope 161 of the starter assembly. The locator, such as a stud 73 for the intake and exhaust poppet valve biasing spring 89, 97 , may also be cast integraily with the engine block. A further feature of the engine resides in a combination crankcase breather mechanism and oil fill cap 119 which due to its remote location from the engine crankshaft as well as the tortuous air flow path through the cap to the atmosphere minimizes the egress of oil from the engine through the breather mechanism.
