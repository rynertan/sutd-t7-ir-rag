# Mounting assembly for high speed rotor discs.

## Abstract
A high speed turbo disc mounting assembly for the reduction of turbo disc failure and the provision for disc migration radially at high speeds comprising a shaft, a bushing mounted on said shaft having an annular flange through which torque pin apertures are provided, and a turbo disc mounted on said bushing such that torque pins aligned in channels at the interface of the disc and bushing provide for rotational engagement of the disc to the bushing without restricting outward migration of the disc or imparting undue stress concentrations to the high dynamic stress level area of said disc.
