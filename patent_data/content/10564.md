# Gas insulated switch gear apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas insulated switch gear apparatus having first and second base planes 100, 200 is disclosed. Arranged on the first and second base planes are feeder switching ap paratus 110, 210 comprising gas filled circuit breakers 111, 211 comprising gas filled circuit breakers 111, 211 and first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches 113, 114 213, 214 at opposite sides of each of the gas filled circuit breakers. Gas insulated busbar devices 120, 220 are arranged to be horizontally spaced from the feeder switching apparatus. On the first and second base planes, the first gas insulated disconnecting switches 113, 213 are connected to the gas insulated busbar devices while the second gas insulated disconnecting switches 114, 214 are connected to bushings 115, 215 . Axial lines of the feeder switching apparatus along which the first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches are arranged traverse axial lines of the gas insulated bus bar devices. The axial lines of the gas insulated busbar devices arranged on the first and second base planes lie in a common vertical plane containing the axial lines and lie in the base planes. A gas insulated connecting busbar device 400 for interconnecting the gas insulated busbar devices arranged on the first and second base planes is arranged in the common vertical plane such that an axial line thereof traverses the axial lines of the gas insulated busbar devices.
