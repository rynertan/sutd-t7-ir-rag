# Encapsulation by entrapment within polyhydroxy polymer borates.

## Abstract
Chemical biological agent to be encapsulated are dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous paste of gel forming polyhydroxy polymer. Subsequent addition of boric acid or a boric acid derivative at an alkaline pH converts the paste into a gel, thereby entrapping the agents in a protective matrix. Encapsulation of biologically active compositions provides a shield against hostile environments, improves safety in handling, and slows the release of such compounds to the surrounding medium. Highly volatile liquids are protected against losses by evaporation. Encapsula tion also provides protection against decomposition from expo sure to ultraviolet light.
