# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING RANDOM CHARGES ON A MOVING WEB

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for neutralizing random electro static charges on a moving web that simultaneously leaves the web with a charge that is substantially uniform and may be positive, negative or substantially neutral. The apparatus includes one or more ion generators 36 84, 92 at least one of which is supplied with an AC voltage superimposed on a DC voltage. An AC powered ion generator emits positive and negative ions that migrate to the moving web 12 and neutralize oppositely charged areas located thereon. The DC voltage 28 76 on which the AC voltage 14, 16, 22 58, 60, 66 is superimposed at the ion generator controls ion concentration and therefore the residual web charge.
