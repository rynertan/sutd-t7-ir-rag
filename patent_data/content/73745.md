# Feeder striper device for circular knitting machines.

## Abstract
Feeder striper device 10 for circular knitting ma chines, whereby said device can be anchored substan tially at a tangent to the needle cylinders 12 and com prises a carrying structure 11 consisting of a plurality of firm supporting surfaces 111 to support the yarn carriers 13 , and whereby said firm supporting surfaces 111 are mutually sloped fanwise in both a substan tially radial direction B and a substantially tangential direction A in relation to the needle cylinders 12 , whereby said yarn carriers 13 are fitted in a relatively movable manner in relation to said firm surfaces 111 so as to enable their own ends 113 to follow a substan tially continuous and curved path 21 121 during their movement between their working position and their po sition of rest, and whereby each yarn carrier 13 coo perates with a four bar linkage positioning and support ing moans 14 41 44 provided with only one degree of freedom and anchored revolvably to their respective firm supporting surface 111 , and whereby suitable actuation means 15 are envisaged for rotating the respective linkage means 14 41 44 , on each of which there act bias means 16 61 cooperating with the carrying struc ture 11 and means which cause three dimensional ad justment 18 19 31, 81 31 of the working position of the ends 113 of said yarn carriers 13 .
