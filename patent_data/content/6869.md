# FLUIDIZED AIR DEPOLARIZED ELECTRODES AND RELATED APPARATUS AND METHODS.

## Abstract
Carrier particles wetted by electrolyte circulate between an absorber zone, wherein they contact air and take up oxygen, and a cathode zone where they contact a current collector and are depleted of oxygen. The arrangement is such that the air does not bubble through liquid electrolyte, and the two functions may take place either in separate beds or in a common bed. In one embodiment, oxygen is transferred to th particles through an oxygen permeable electrolyte impermeable membrane, while in another air is brought into direct contact with the particles in an air fluidised bed. In the latter case, air may be forced through the bed by the pressure developed by impingement on the front of a moving vehicle. The electrolyte may include an intermediate oxidin. redn. couple to facilitate oxygen transfer to the cathode. There is an independent claim to a method of utilising atmospheric oxygen in a fuel cell, expressed in similar terms. The cell is particularly intended for vehicle propulsion. The construction provides a high power density, and ready replacement of the electrode catalyst, which may be a relatively cheap material such as activated carbon or rare earth cobalt. Undesired intake of nitrogen into the system is eliminated.
