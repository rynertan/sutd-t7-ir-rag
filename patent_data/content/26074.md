# Method and apparatus for drying products, especially corn or piece products.

## Abstract
The invention is, in one aspect, a method of drying pro ducts, especially corn or piece products, in the course of which a drying gas flow successively through at least two layers of the products to be dried, the moisture content of the drying gas is diminished by contacting it with a desiccant liquid, and the desiccant liquid is at least partly regenerated after the contact. Before and or after flowing through each layer the gas is contacted with the desiccant liquid. In another aspect, apparatus for drying products, especially corn or piece products, comprises a holder 10 for holding the products 1 to be dried, a device 13 for causing a drying gas flow through the holding means, a gas processing device 8AG, 8BG...8EC for contacting the gas flowing through the holding means with a desiccant liquid, and means 57 for regenerating the desiccant liquid. The holder 10 has at least two drying sec tions 5AA, 5AB, 5AC which are placed successively in the direction of the drying gas flow, and before and or after each drying section a gas processing device 8AC, 8BC ....8EC is placed in the way of the gas stream.
