# POWDERED ELASTOMER DRY BLENDS AND PROCESS FOR INJECTION MOLDING

## Abstract
A powdered elastomeric composition is formed by combining a powder elastomer and a powdered predisper sion of liquid or pasty components, such as process oil, lubricants and waxes, in a dry powder filler. The powdered predispersion is combined with the powder elastomer using a ribbon blender to form a consistent homogeneous powder dry blend which can be directly injection molded without any additional mixing other than that occuring in the extruder portion of the injection molding apparatus.
