# A didactic game defined by a block subdivided into suitable portions to compose three dimensional figures.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with the technical field of structures adapted to provide entertainment of a didactic character, and in particular with a block subdivided into suit able portions to compose three dimensional figures. The technical problem to be solved was that of providing a simple structure whereby a very high number of three dimensional configurations could be obtained, the elements which make up the game being in such mutual relationship as to favor the attainment of such three dimensional configurations. The problem is solved by a didactic game defined by a cubic block 2 subdivided into portions 1 which comprise two first pris matic bodies 3 defined by right prisms having isosceles right triangle bases and a combined volume equal to one half that of said block 2 , a parallelepipedon like inner body 4 with square bases, and second prismatic bodies defined by eight prisms with isosceles right triangle bases and being separated into complementary bodies 5 , defining together with said inner body 4 the form of said first prismatic body 3 and auxiliary bodies 6 which are identical to one another and together define the form of a further first prismatic body 3 .
