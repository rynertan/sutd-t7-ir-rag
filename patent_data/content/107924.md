# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FILLING VALVE BAG

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for use in filling a valve bag 50 eliminates sifting of product during the filling process. A filling nozzle 10 is inserted into the valve of a bag 50 to be filled. A flow of particulate material is provided through the filling nozzle 10 and into the bag. When the bag is full, the flow of particulate material is terminated. A blast of high pressure air is then introduced into the nozzel 10 in order to clear the nozzle of any residual particulate material therein. A low pressure blast of air is introduced between the nozzle and the filling valve to suspend any particles present in the filling valve after the nozzle has been cleared by the high pressure blast. A vacuum is introduced into the nozzle to suck any suspended particles out of the filling valve after the low pressure blast has been introduced. A boot 14 can be inflated around the nozzle 10 to seal the nozzle 10 within the bag valve before filling the bag 50 .
