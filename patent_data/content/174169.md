# ABSORPTION SYSTEM FOR REFRIGERATION AND HEAT PUMPING

## Abstract
There is provided an absorption system for refrigeration and heat pumping. The system includes generator means E in which refrigerant vapor is boiled off a strong solution, condenser means C in which the refrigerant vapor is condensed into liquid refrigerant, evaporator means E in which the liquid refrigerant is turned into refrigerant vapors, and absorber means A in which the refrigerant vapors are absorbed in a weak solution, turning it into a strong solution. There is further provided a liquid gas jet pump means 2 incorporated into the strong solution weak solution cycle of the system, at a point upstream of said absorber means, in which liquid gas jet pump means, the weak solution from the generator means, flowing through the nozzle of the jet pump means, is used as motive fluid to draw into the pump, and intimately mix with, refrigerant vapor emerging from the evaporator means. The original pressure of the motive fluid, reduced during the passage of the latter through said nozzle, being at least partly recovered in a pressure recovery member of the jet pump means.
