# System for measuring parameters of a tubular test object.

## Abstract
A system for improving the pulse echo type of testing to determine certain parameters of tubes, such as internal diameter, external diameter, wall thickness, etc. There are sequential pairs of pulses directed transversely to the tube wall so that the transit times of the respective pulses and their reflections from a tube surface of each pair, are substantially different. From the sum value of the transit times associated with each pulse pair the respective para meter is derived. Inaccuracies due to undesired oscillations of the driving shaft for rotating the pulse transducer within the tube to be tested are eliminated. By means of auxiliary reflective surfaces the pulses and their reflections of each pair of pulses emitted from the transducer are directed transversely relative to the respective tube wall in substan tially one and the same plane.
