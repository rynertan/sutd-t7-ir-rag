# Catheter placement device.

## Abstract
A catheter placement device includes an adapter 26 with an elastomeric grommet 30 through which a pliable catheter 14 is fed into a blood vessel of a patient. The grommet 30 has a flange 66 engageable with the catheter 14 and effects a relatively low resistance to distal move ment of the catheter 14 and a relatively high resistance to proximal movement of the catheter 14 . A locking member 28 may be used with the adapter 26 to hold the catheter 14 against movement through the adapter 26 . The adapter 26 and member 28 are relatively rotatable to squeeze the grommet 30 against the catheter 14 . Retention members 60,62 may be used to prevent inadvertent separation of the adapter 26 and member 28 during relative rotation.
