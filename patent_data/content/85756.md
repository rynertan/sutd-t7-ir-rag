## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 1 SUBSTITUTED 6 n PROPYL 8 METHYLIMIDAZO 1, 5 d 1 as TRIAZIN 4 3H ones This invention relates to novel methods for the preparation of 5 lower alkanoyl 4 methyl 2 n propyl imidazoles IV which are the immediate precursors of the corresponding l lower alkyl 6 n propyl 8 methylimidazo l,5 d as triazin 4 3H ones VI . These final products of the novel processes of the present invention are highly useful for meliorating asthma and for inhibiting diesterase in mammals. They inhibit the release of mediators to the extent of 50 from the human basophil at 13pM concentration and also protect guinea pigs from anaphylactic shock.In the mouse, they are active both orally and intraperitoneally in inhibiting passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The original eight step synthesis of the anti asthamatic agents VI , as set forth in U.S. ReissuePatent No. 30,511, proceeded through the key intermediates IV . These intermediates were prepared in six steps, three of which a an exothermic mitric acid oxidation, b a Grignard reaction, and c an environmentally unacceptable chronic acid oxidation were potentially hazardous for scale up. It has now been discovered that the novel synthesis of the present invention proceeds in high yield and is totally free of all scale up hazards.The steps involved in the novel processes of the present invention may be depicted as follows EMI2.1 EMI3.1 wherein R is methyl, ethyl or n propyl. In accordance with the above reaction scheme, treatment of a 2,4 alkanedione I with sodium nitrite in aqueous sulfuric acid provides the corresponding 3 oximino 2,4 alkanedione II in high yield. The catalytic hydrogenation of 11 with palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of butyric anhydride provides the corresponding 3 butyrylamino 2,4 alkanedione III also in high yield. Cyclization of III to the corresponding 2 n propyl 4 methyl 5 acylimidazoles IV is readily accomplished by heating III with a suitable ammoniating agent such as ammonium acetate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, etc. in an inert organic solvent such as formamide toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, and the like.Condensation of II with commercially available 2 aminovaleric acid or its esters provides IV directly. This condensation is conveniently carried out in a suitable inert solvent e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, 2 methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, dimethoxyethane, n butanol DMF, toluene at the reflux temperature 80 135 C. for a period of time of from about two to about 24 hours. Condensation of IV with ethyl carbazate in n butanol or diphenyl ether under reflux for several hours provides V which may be isolated by evaporation of the reaction solvent.Cyclization of V is accomplished in diphenyl ether at 150 250 C. for 15 45 minutes to provide the anti asthmatic agents VI . Isolation of VI is achieved by dilution of the reaction mixture with petroleum ether or by extraction of the reaction mixture with 10 aqueous hydrochloric acid. The acid extract is neutralized with potassium carbonate and the product extracted with solvents such as chloroform or ethyl acetate. The invention will be described in greater detail in conjunction with the following specific examples. Example 1 Preparation of 3 butyramido 2 ,4 pentanedione 3 Oximino 2,4 pentanedione 38.7 g., 0.3 mol was dissolved in a solution of butyric acid 30 ml and butyric anhydride 150 ml., 0.9 mol contained in a 500 ml. Parr bottle. The 10 Pd on charcoal catalyst 2 g. was added and the reaction mixture was purged and pressurized with hydrogen to 55 psi, and shaken at room temperature until the theoretical volume of hydrogen had been consumed. The catalyst was separated by filtration and the butyric acid was removed under vacuum. The resulting oily crystals were recrystallized from hot dibutyl ether to give 49.7 g. of product 89.5 yield m.p. 740 750C. The above procedure was repeated using the following oximes 3 oximino 2,4 hexanedione and 3 oximino 2,4 heptandione. Example 2 Preparation of 5 acetyl 4 methyl 2 n propylimidazole 3 Oximino 2,4 pentanedione 1.5 g., 11 mmol was dissolved in butyic acid 2 ml. and butyric anhydride 10 ml. contained in a 250 ml. Parr bottle, then 10 Pd on charcoal catalyst 0.1 g. was added and the reaction mixture was purged and pressurized with hydrogen to 55 psi. After shaking at room temperature for 3 hours, the theoretical amount of hydrogen had been consumed. The catalyst was removed by filtration and 12 ml. of concentration NH40H was added to the filtrate. The reaction mixture was heated to 1200C. for 18 hours, then cooled to room temperature. Saturated sodium chloride solution and CH2C12 were added. The organic phase was washed twice with 20 HC1 solution, and the combined acidic phases were neutralized with concentrated NH40H and washed withCH2C12.The organic phase was dried and the solvent was evaporated to give 0.5 g. of the imidazole as a slight brown oil. Using the procedure above, the oximes listed in Example 1 were converted into the corresponding imidazoles. In the case of unsymmetrical oximes, the ratio of product isomers was approximately 1 1.
