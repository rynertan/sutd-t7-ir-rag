# Shifting device.

## Abstract
A device for shafting packs P of panels along the workpiece support table L of a sawing machine, and the top surface of a stack of panels P comprises a pair of levers 1 2 hingedly mounted on a motorized carriage C . The first lower lever 1 is adapted to frontally contact by its vertical fore end defining a vertical pushing front 13 the side of the pack P and is provided with a lower jaw element 17 arranged so as to act on the underside of the edge of the pack P of panels, while a second upper lever 2 is designed for forming, with its fore end 20, 21 the upper jaw element acting on the top side of the edge of the pack P of panels. Means 26 are provided for the actuation of the said second lever for gripping the edge of the pack between the said two jaw elements 17,20 21 . The said lower jaw element 17 can be moved from an operative position in which it projects forwards with respect to the vertical pushing front of the first lever 1 , whereby the shifting device is adapted to grip the edge of the pack P of panels, to an unoperative position in which it is retracted with respect to the vertical pushing front of the first lever 1 , whereby the shifting device is adapted to act as a pusher which shifts the pack P of panels with a skimming action with respect to the underlying flat horizon tal surface, without gripping the edge of the pack itself.
