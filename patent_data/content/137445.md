## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESS FOR C METHYLATION OF 2 METHYLBUTYRATES SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with a novel process which may be depicted as EMI1.1 The products .11, of the process are more active inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase than are the starting Compounds I, and thus of greater utility in the treatment of atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia, familial hypercholesterolemia and like disorders.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Compounds of structure I are known and known to have HMG CoA reductase inhibitory properties.They are the natural fermentation products mevinolin U.S. Patent 4,231,938 and compactin U.S. Patent 3,983,140 and derivatives thereof, all with the natural 2 methylbutyrate side chain. Hydrogenation products, including tetrahydromevinolin are described in U.S. Patent 4,351,844. Some compounds of structure II with the 2,2dimethylbutyrate side chain and processes for their preparation are known in EPO published application 33538. However, the process disclosed therein involves 4 distinct chemical steps 1 de esterification of the 2 methylbutyrate 2 protection of the 4 hydroxy of the pyranone ring 3 re esterification to form the desired 2,2 dimethylbutyrate and 4 deprotection of the 4 hydroxy group. Now, with the present invention there is provided a novel process for the preparation of compounds of structure II involving only one chemicalstep and resulting in overall yields much higher than those realized by the prior art process, with the expenditure of much less time, labor and materials. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel process of this invention may be represented by EMI3.1 wherein the dotted lines represent possible double bonds there being 0, 1 or 2 double bonds n represents 1, 2, 3 or 4 andR is 1 methyl, 2 hydroxy, or 3 C114alkoxy, RÃš and R are independently. 1 C3alkyl, or 2 R and R2 joined together, form a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle such as pyrrolidine or piperidine with the nitrogen to which they are attached X is halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo andM is a cation derived from lithium, sodium, or potassium. A preferred use for the novel process of this invention is in the preparation of compounds of formula II wherein there is no double bond, one double bond in the 3,4 position, or two double bonds in the 3,4 and 4a,5 positions n is 1 or 2 and R is methyl in the 2 position if n l and in the 2 and 6positions when n 2. A most preferred use for the novel process is in the preparation of the compound of structural formula EMI4.1 The novel process comprises C methylation at the 2 position of the 2 methylbutyryloxy group of I at the 8 position of the polyhydronaphthalene moiety. The lactone compound is first converted to an alkali metal salt, preferably the potassium salt, of the dihydroxycarboxylate.Although any conceivable process for preparing a dry salt would suffice, it is convenient to add a substantially stoichiometric amount of aqueous potassium hydroxide to a solution of the lactone starting material in a hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene or cyclohexane containing a small amount of a C13 alkanol, preferably isopropanol, ethanol or methanol, stirring for a few minutes to about an hour and finally concentrating to dryness in vacuo. The residue is subjected to rigorous drying such as by azeotropic distillation with cyclohexane or toluene, as the actual methylation procedure that follows proceeds properly only under rigorously anhydrous conditions. The dry alkali metal salt is dissolved in an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, or the like, cooled to about 50 to about 250C, preferably 35 to 30GC, and treated with an excess of a strong base such as an alkali metal amide, wherein the alkali metal is lithium, sodium or potassium, preferably lithium, and the amide is diethylamide, pyrrolidide, dimethyl amide or diisopropyl amide in an ethereal solvent in a dry inert environment. After about 2 to 8 hours, preferably about 2 hours at about 50 to 250C, preferably 350 to 300C, a methylhalide, such as methylbromide, methylchloride or methyl iodide, preferably methyl bromide, or methyl iodide, is added to the mixture while maintaining the low temperature.Treatment with a strong base and methyl halide as described can be repeated if appreciable quantities of starting material remain. After about 0.5 to about 3 hours, following final addition of methyl halide the reaction mixture is quenched by adding it to an excess of water. To isolate the product the aqueous phase is adjusted to pH 3 6 with a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric acid or the like. The aqueous phase is extracted with cyclohexane or toluene, dried, filtered. refluxed for 3 20 hours and finally concentrated, and filtered.
