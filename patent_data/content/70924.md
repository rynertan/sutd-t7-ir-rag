The technically pure hexacis methoxynethyl melamine is a solid which melts at about 490C and possesses an etherification degree average number of methoxy groups per mole close to the theoretical value, which, as is known, is equal to 6. The commercial hexacis methoxymethyl melamine has generally an etherification degree lower than 6 and is in the form of a more or less viscous syrup, as it contains more or less considerable amounts of auto condensation products, which render the above mentioned product less selective in the applicative reactions in respect of the technically pure product.
