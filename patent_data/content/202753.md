# METHOD OF COMBATTING OF CAKING OF PARTICULATE MATERIALS

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of treating a particulate material to combat caking thereof, which comprises at least partially coating at least some of the particles thereof with an anti caking agent comprising a substance wherein a lipophi lic moiety is attached to a hydrophilic moiety by means of an alkylating reactive grouping. The invention also provides a method of treating a substrate to protect it from ultra violet radiation which comprises at least partially coating it with a coating material which comprises a protective substance wherein a lipophilic moiety is attached to a hydrophilic moiety by means of an alkylating reactive grouping, the hydrophilic moiety being a polar organic residue having a molecular weight of at most 450 and being a grouping selected from the residues of polyols, internal anhydrides of polyols, amines, amides, alkanolamines, azolines and poly oxyethylene groupings having at most 10 ethylene oxide units. The invention also provides an anti caking agent and a coating material for protecting a substrate from ultra violet radiation.
