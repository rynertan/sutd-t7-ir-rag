# IMPROVED VESSEL CLOSURES AND METHOD OF FORMING THE CLOSURES

## Abstract
Improved vessel closures and method of forming the clo sures. The vessels 10 each include an elongate filling dis pensing tube 14 which has an open end 16 which is sealed by the closures 20, 22, 28, 32, 36, 42, 46, 50, 58, 64 of the invention which can be disposable or reusable. The disposable closure 20, 22, 36 can be formed by heat sealing the open end 16 of the tubes or folding the open end 16 of the tubes back upon the tube 14 and shrinking material around the tube 14 and open end 16 . The reusable closures 28, 32, 42, 46, 50, 58, 64 can be formed by plug type, heat sealed ends 30, 44, 48, 52 which are shaped to be reinserted into the tubes and rings 34, 68 which can be placed over a folded over end and the tube. The vessels 10 can include an adhesive pad 40 to affix the vessel 10 to a convenient surface.
