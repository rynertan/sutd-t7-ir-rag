# Method for the sub terranean generation of heat.

## Abstract
Subterranean generation of heat as a source of energy optionally accompanied by the production of minerals. In subterranean formations of minerals that are capable of undergoing an enthalpic degradation, such degradation is artificially accelerated by severals orders of magnitude. To this end a bore hole is drilled down to the desired formation and accelerated enthalpic degradation is made to occur by a suitable ignition. For the extraction of energy the bore hole is flushed with water and the resulting steam is with drawn. In one embodiment, one and the same bore hole is used for charging water and withdrawing steam. In another embodiment the bore holes are arranged pairwise, one bore hole of each pair serving for ignition and introduction of water and the other serves for the withdrawal of steam. After the formation has cooled down to the point where steam is no longer generated to any significant extent it is possible to continue with flushing and subjecting the reemerging aqueous phase to an operation or sequence of operations for the recovery of minerals therefrom.
