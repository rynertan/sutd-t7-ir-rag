# Method for monitoring the crystallographic texture of metallic tubes by use of x ray diffraction.

## Abstract
The crystallographic texture of metallic tubular articles is identified by nondestructive inspection and characterized by an X ray diffraction technique where X rays are directed onto the surface of the tubular article diffracted X rays from the tube surface are detected by use of a position sensitive detector. By effecting relative movement of the tubular arti cle and the X ray source in both a rotational direction about the axis of the tube and in an axial direction, and measuring intensities from multiple Bragg peaks of the diffracted X rays from a plurality of locations on the cube the crystallo graphic texture of the tube is characterized and identified after inspection.
