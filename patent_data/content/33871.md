## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a bushing for producing glass fiber filaments. More particularly, it relates to a bushing for producing glass fiber filaments without flooding. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTS Glass fiber filaments have been produced by flowing a molten glass through many small holes formed on a bottom surface of a bushing for holding the molten glass mass extruding and drawing the molten glass into filaments and winding the glass fiber filaments on a paper bobbin fitted on a collector which is rotated nt high speed, in traverse swing. The molten glass flow is drawn under drawing force caused by winding to form the glass fiber filaments having a diameter of about 5 to 25jL and the glass fiber filaments are sized to form a strand which is wound. A bushing is usually made of an alloy of noble metal such as platinum and many small holes are formed on the bottom of the bushing and each tubular tip is fitted to each small hole in projection.The tip is used for preventing the flooding phenomenon that is to bond the molten glass flowing through many small holes in the condition wetting the peripheral parts of the small holes with the molten glass. When the flooding phenomenon is caused.the production can not be continued. The bonded molten glass should be separated from the bottom surface of the bushing before the restart of the production. It takes a long time for the separation of the bonded molten glass. Recently, in view of an improvement of the productivity, a large size of a bushing has been required and an effort for increasing number of small holes on one bushing has been made.Therefore, it has been reconsidered to use a tipless bushing wherein many small holes are formed on a flat bottom of the bushing without tips. The tipless bushing can be prepared by a simple process in comparison with the bushing equipped with tips and the number of the small holes per unit area can be increased and the tipless bushing has light weight to reduce the amount of the expensive noble metal in comparison with the bushing equipped with tips. On the other hand, the following disadvantages are found. The bottom of the bushing has many small holes whereby the rigidity is low and the mechanical strength is low to easily cause deformation in the use. Various proposals such as the equipment of the reinforcing part and the arch curvature of the bottom of the bushing have been made. The flooding of the molten glass flow is severe to spread the flooding on the whole surface of the bottom of the bushing.It is difficult to separate the bonded molten glass or to prevent the bonding of the molten glass. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a bushing for producing glass fiber filaments which has an improved mechanical strength without reducing number of small holes per unit area in comparison with a tipless bushing and which does not cause the flooding phenomenon. The foregoing and other objects of the present invention have been attained by providing a bushing for producing glass fiber filaments which comprises many small holes for flowing a molten glass in a bottom plate of the bushing which holds the molten glass and annular projections in one piece of the bottom plate around the small holes on the outer surface of the bottom plate. Each annular projection has a flat surface at each end.The annular projections are projected in one piece around the small holes with each curvature side wall or with each straight side wall.The height of the annular projection is usually in a range of 0. 3 to 2.0 mm preferably 0.5 to 1.5 mm and the ratio of the height to the diameter of each small hole is usually in a range of 1 1 to 1 6 and the diameter of the small hole is usually in a range of 0. 7 to 2.0 mm and a distance between centers of adjacent small holes is usually in a range of 1. 3 to 2 times of the diameter of the small hole. The thickness of the annular projection can be thin though it is preferable to have the flat end having a width of 0.1 to 0.4 mm.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Figure 1 is the enlarged sectional view of the small hole part of the bushing of the present invention. Figure 2 is the enlarged bottom view of the small hole part of the bushing of Figure 1. Figures 3 and 4 are the enlarged sectional views of the other embodiments of the bushing of the present invention as Figure 1.The annular projection 2 having slightly curved side surface is formed on the lower outer peripheral part of the small hole 1 formed on the bottom plate A of the bushing. The height of the annular projection 2 is usually in a range of 0.3 to 2 mm preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The annular projection can be formed as follows. As shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7, small holes 1 having a desired shape are formed on the bottom plate of the bushing and the peripheral edges of the small holes 1 are pressed by a press machine etc. to deform the peripheral edges to form the projections 2 having each curved side wall or each straight side wall. If necessary, the projections are processed by a cutting process or a grinding process.The bottom plate having the small holes and the annular projections can be assembled to prepare the bushing by the conventional method.The detail of the assembly of the bushing is not repeated since it is clearly understood from the known methods. The bushing of the present invention has the above mentioned structure to impart the following effect. 1 The bushing of the present invention can have an increased number of the small holes and has light weight as the tipless bushing. 2 The bushing of the present invention has many annular projections around the small holes. The resistivity to bending of the bottom plate of the bushing is improved by these projections. The deformation of the bottom plate of the bushing in the use at high temperature can be reduced in comparison with the conventional tip less bushing. The stable operation can be ensured. 3 The flooding phenomenon can be substantially prevented.The stable operation can be continued for a long time in comparison with the conventional tipless bushing. The operating efficiency is increased. 4 Even though molten glass fiber filaments are broken to cause the flooding phenomenon, the time required for returning to the stable working condition can be shortened in comparison with the conventional tipless bushing. 5 As the total effects of 2 to 4 , the productivity is remarkably increased in comparison with the conventional tipless bushing. The embodiments of the present invention will be further illustrated. The resistance to the molten glass flow is reduced when the curved edge 3 of the small hole is formed as shown in Figure 4. It is preferable to have the horizontal annular flat end sur face 4 at each end of the annular projection as shown in Figures 1 to 4 whereby the molten glass flow flowed through the small holes having each annular flat end surface has the same axis as the small hole and accordingly, the times of breaks of the molten glass fiber filaments can be reduced. In the first embodiment shown in Figure 1 the annular flat end surface 4 of the projection 2 is formed between the inner wall of the small hole 1 and a perpendicular side surface 5 and an adjacent curved side surface 6 In the second embodiment shown in Figure 3, the slant side surface 6 is formed and the inlet part of the small hole 1 has larger diameter than the outlet part of the small hole 1 . In the third embodiment shown in Figure 4, curved side surface 6 is formed from the annular flat end surface 4 of the projection. The peripheral edge 3 of the inlet of the small hole is formed in a curved smooth surface to reduce the resistivity to the molten glass flow. The productivity per unit time can be increased in comparison with the other bushing having the same size. In the fourth embodiment shown in Figures 8 and 9, many small holes 1 are formed on the bottom plate A of the bushing, and annular projections 2 are formed in one piece of the bottom plateA on the outer surface 7 to surround the small holes 1 , and the end surfaces 4 of the projections are flat and horizontal and the outer side surfaces 8 of the projections 2 are straight in perpendicular to the flat end surface 4 . The connection of the outer side surface to the outer bottom surface 7 is not limited to the perpendicular and can be curved or slant surface if desired. When the height of the projection 4 is less than 0.3 mm, the flooding phenomenon may be easily caused whereas when it is more than 1.5 mm,it is not easy to separate the bonded molten glass if the flooding is caused.
