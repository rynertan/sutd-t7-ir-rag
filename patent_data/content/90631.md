Pivotal drive means 72, 73, 74, 77 is provided to move the telescopic arrangement 48, 44, 43, 46 between a label receiving position 20, 26, 33, 13 where the transporter 32 collects a label from the printer 15 and a label delivery position. In the label delivery position drive means 45 is effective to cause the arrangement 48, 44, 46, 43 to extend and retract telescopically in order to deliver a label to a package at an applicator station 29 . Control means 65, 66 is provided for measuring the extent of tele scopic extension on each occurrance and for consequentially controlling the telescopic drive means 45 during retractive motion.
