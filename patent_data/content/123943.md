# Signal detecting method in autoradiography.

## Abstract
A signal detecting method in autoradiography, which is applied to an autoradiograph having locational information on radioactively labeled substances such as radioactively labeled biopolymers distributed one dimensionally, being recorded on a radiosensitive material 1 as a visible image, which comprises steps of 1 preliminarily scanning 2 a part of the radiosen sitive material with a light and photoelectrically reading out a portion of the visualized autoradiograph to give an electric signal, to which a signal processing is applied, to determine one dimensional distribution direction of the radioactively labeled substances and 2 finaly scanning 11 the radiosensitive material with a light along said one dimensional distribution direction and photoelectrically reading out the visualized autoradiograph, to obtain the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances as a digital signal.
