# Inorganic filler containing polyolefin resin compositions.

## Abstract
A novel inorganic filler containing polyolefin resin com position exhibits high level stiffness at a temperature in the vicinity of crystalline melting point of the matrix forming polyolefin resin or even at a higher temperature. The composition comprises specified amounts of a matrix forming polyolefin resin, a dispersion phase forming resin, and a fibrous or lamellate inorganic filler. In the composition, one end or a portion thereof of each fiber or lamella of the fibrous or lamellate inorganic filler is covered with the dispersion phase forming resin not uniformly miscible with the polyolefin resin and the other end or a portion thereof of that fiber or lamella is also covered with the dispersion phase forming resin located at a separate position, whereby the filler forms substantially a network structure via the dispersion phase forming resin.
