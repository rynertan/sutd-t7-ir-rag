# A multi hull craft.

## Abstract
A multi hull craft comprises two spaced substantially parallel hulls 14, 15 and a third hull 16 lying between the lines of the two spaced hulls 14, 15 and or extensions thereof. The third hull 16 is relatively movable with respect to the two spaced hulls 14, 15 so as to have a different heading from the two spaced hulls for steerage of the craft. In order to enable the craft to be steered easily without requiring the application of high steering forces by the helmsman the two spaced hulls 14, 15 and the third hull 16 are inflatable.
