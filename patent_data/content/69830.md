# Process for heat carrier generation.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for heat carrier generation for the advanced cracking reaction process comprising separately preheating an oxidant stream 10 , 12 , 14 joining a fuel stream and at least a portion of the process steam stream 30, 30 to form a stream having a steam to fuel ratio between 0.1 10 preheating the joined stream 18 reforming 32 said joined stream at a temperature up to 1000 C in the presence of a reforming catalyst comprising at least one metal selected from the metals of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements on an inert support separately preheating any remainder of the process steam 24 and mixing said preheated oxidant, joint and steam streams to burn in admixture in a combustion zone 26 to provide a hot gassous combustion products stream.
