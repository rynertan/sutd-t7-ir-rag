# A device for spreading whole tobacco leaves.

## Abstract
A device for spreading tobacco leaves 4 comprises a suction box 1 with a perforated wall 2 and a shield com posed of a plurality of sections 5 transversely movable out wards from a closed position in which they cover the perfo rated wall 2 with the exception of a central area against which the mid rib portion of the tobacco leaf can be clamped by means of a rail 6,7 . The leaf is held by suction against the shield sections 5 during their opening movement and is so spread and stretched transversely in a direction away from the mid rib. Trailing brushes 8 that are moved outwards together with the shield sections 5 are further provided for this purpose. The perforated wall 2 may comprise knives which, when being run over by a roller, cut out wrappers or binders or blanks therefor from the tobacco leaf 4 while this is still being held firmly against the wall 2 after full opening of the shield 5,5 .
