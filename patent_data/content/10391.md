# Control circuit for a motor driven automatic valve.

## Abstract
A motor driven valve control circuit includes an electronic switch element 19,13 biased to conduct by a resistor 20 connected by diodes 21,22 to both poles of a switch 23 . A relay 10 controlled by one pole of the switch determines the direction of connection of the motor 11 in series with the element 19,13 . A thyristor 24 connected to shunt the bias current away from the switch element 19,13 is gated by a voltage comparator 30 comparing the voltage across a motor current sensing element 17 with a reference voltage, so as to fire the thyristor when the motor current exceeds a set limit. The circuit eliminates the need for latching limit switches usually employed in motor driven valve controls.
