# LAMP WITH MOVING LIGHT DISPLAY

## Abstract
A lamp with a moving light display comprises a lamp body 10 on which are mounted a bulb 26 , reflector 28 and ex terior lens 12 . The bulb 26 is mounted on the body 10 by means of a resilient support structure 24 such that a vibration frequency produced by a moving object to which the lamp is at tached induces motion in the bulb 26 relative to the reflector 28 . To optimise this movement the resiliently mounted bulb 26 has a resonant frequency equal to the vibration frequency, or a harmonic or subharmonic thereof. Any combination of the bulb 26 reflector 28 and a light directing lens may be thus mounted to induce relative movement. Such relative move ment causes variation in the intensity and direction of the observed light which calls attention to the object thus em phasising its presence.
