## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser device having a buried heterostructure. EP A 0192 450 represents prior art within the terms of Article 54 3 EPC and is, therefore , not relevant to the question of inventive step. Buried type semiconductor laser devices, in which an active layer for laser oscillation is surrounded by semiconductor layers having a refractive index smaller than that of the active layer and an energy gap larger than that of the active layer, are advantageous in that laser oscillation can be attained in a stable transverse mode at low threshold current level, and accordingly they have been used as light sources for optical communication systems and or optical measuring systems. For these reasons, they are industrially important devices. However, with such buried type semiconductor laser devices, ineffective current not passing through the active layer greatly increases with an increase in current injected into the devices, which causes limitations on the maximum value of the output power of the devices. Moreover, the ineffective current increases with a rise in temperature, which causes difficulties in practical application of these buried type semiconductor laser devices, especially InGaAsP InP semiconductor laser devices. The reasons why the above mentioned ineffective current arises seem to be as follows. Buried type semiconductor laser devices are, for example, produced in such a manner as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The laser device shown in Fig. 2 is produced as follows On an n InP substrate 1, an n InP buffer layer 2, a non doped InGaAsP active layer 3, and a p InP cladding layer 4 are successively grown by an epitaxial growth technique. The resulting multi layered epitaxial growth crystal is subjected to a chemical etching treatment to form a mesa. Then, on both sides of the mesa, a p InP burying layer 5 and an n InP burying layer 6 are grown. The laser device shown in Figure 3 is produced as follows On an n InP substrate 1, a p InP burying layer 5 and an n InP burying layer 6 are successively grown by an epitaxial growth technique. The resulting epitaxial growth crystal is subjected to a chemical etching treatment to form a groove. Then, an n InP buffer layer 2, an InGaAsP active layer 3, and a p InP cladding layer 4 are successively grown in the groove. The device produced according to the production mode shown in each of Figures 2 and 3 attains laser oscillation depending upon the injected current 7 passing through the active layer 3. Since the p n junction at the interface between the burying layers 5 and 6 positioned at the sides of the active layer 3 is reversely biased, little current passes through the burying layers 5 and 6 when the injected current 7 is small. However, a considerable amount of current passes through the burying layers 5 and 6 positioned at the sides of the active layer 3 as the injected current 7 increases. This is because a thyristor composed of the cladding layer 4, the burying layer 5 and the buffer layer 2 or the substrate 1 is made conductive by a gate current 7b which flows from the cladding layer 4 to the burying layer 5 Higuchi In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor laser device comprising a mesa striped laser oscillation operation area having in succession a semiconductor n substrate, an active layer with a refractive index higher than that of said semiconductor n substrate and with an energy gap smaller than that of said semiconductor n substrate, and a p cladding layer with a polarity different from that of said semiconductor n substrate, the device compriseing further a multi layered burying crystal having in succession, at the sides of said mesa striped laser oscillation operation area, a n first burying layer with the same polarity as said semiconductor n substrate, a p second burying layer with a different polarity from said semiconductor n substrate, and a n third burying layer with the same polarity as said semiconductor n substrate, both side faces of said mesa striped laser oscillation operation area being covered with said n first burying layer, whereby injected current flowing into a thyristor composed of said p cladding layer, said n first burying layer and said semiconductor n substrate can be suppressed. In a preferred embodiment, the semiconductor laser device further comprises a buffer layer with the same polarity as said semiconductor substrate between said semiconductor substrate and said active layer. In a preferred embodiment, the semiconductor laser device further comprises a second cladding layer on both said mesa portion and said third burying layer. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a semiconductor laser device in which the flow of current into burying layers positioned at the sides of an active layer is suppressed so that ineffective current is minimal even though current injected into the device is increased 2 providing a semiconductor laser device in which high output power operation can be achieved without an increase in effective current regardless of an increase in current injected into the device, so that the device is suitable for a signal light source and 3 providing a semiconductor laser device in which, since ineffective current not passing through the active layer is minimal, heat generation of the device due to the ineffective current is prevented and the device operates even at a significantly high temperature. By way of example only, a specific embodiment of the present invention will now be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figs. 2 and 3 illustrating the prior art have already been described, and in which Fig.1 shows a semiconductor laser device of the present invention, which is produced as follows On the 100 face of an n InP substrate 1, an n InP buffer layer the thickness thereof being 3 µm 2, a non doped InGaAsP active layer the light emitting wavelength thereof being 1.3 µm and the thickness thereof being 0.2 µm 3, and a p InP cladding layer the thickness thereof being 0.5 µm 4 are successively grown by liquid phase epitaxy. On the resulting multi layered growth crystal, a photoresist is formed into a striped pattern not shown having a width of 2 µm in the 011 direction, by photolithography. Then, the multi layered growth crystal is etched by a Br methanol solution to remove the area around the striped photoresist from the top of the cladding layer 4 to the inside of the buffer layer 2, resulting in a mesa stripe underneath the striped photoresist. The width of the mesa stripe is as narrow as approximately 2 µm, and if the height of the mesa stripe is set at approximately 2 µm, crystal growth on the mesa stripe in the succeeding process in which burying layers are grown will be able to be suppressed Mito et al Denshi Tsushin Gakkai Technical Report OQE 80 116 . Although the buffer layer 2 is not necessarily required, it functions to prevent the effect of lattice distortion, etc., in the InP substrate 1. Then, on the n InP buffer layer 2, an n InP first burying layer the thickness thereof in the flat portion being 0.5 µm 8 having the same polarity as the buffer layer 2 or the substrate 1 , a p InP second burying layer the thickness thereof in the flat portion being 0.8 µm 5 having a different polarity from the polarity of the buffer layer 2 or the substrate 1 , an n InP third burying layer the thickness thereof in the flat portion being 0.8 µm 6 having the same polarity as the buffer layer 2 or the substrate 1 , and a p InP cladding layer the thickness thereof being 3 µm 4 are successively grown by liquid phase epitaxy. The cladding layer 4 is thick enough to cover the mesa portion. Then, an n sided electrode not shown and a p sided electrode not shown are formed on the back face of the substrate 1 and the upper face of the cladding layer 4 , respectively, followed by cleaving at the 110 face, resulting in a resonator for laser oscillation. It is most important that the above mentioned structure has a first burying layer 8 which has the same polarity as the buffer layer 2 or the substrate 1 . Because of the first burying layer 8, the gate current 7b never flows into the second and third burying layers 5 and 6. Ineffective current flows, instead, front the cladding layer 4 into the first burying layer 8 without passing through the active layer 3. This fact can be explained in greater detail by Fig. 4, wherein Fig. 4 a shows an electrically equivalent circuit of the conventional semi conductor laser devices shown in figs. 2 and 3, and Fig. 4 b shows an electrically equivalent circuit of the semiconductor laser device of this example shown in Fig.1. A current blocking structure can be represented by the equivalent circuit of a thyristor, i.e., the circuit surrounded by the dotted ellipse, in both the semiconductor laser devices shown in Fig.1 and Figs. 2 or 3. With the conventional device structure represented by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.4 a , the gate current I On the other hand, with the device structure of the present invention represented by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.4 b , ineffective current which passes through a diode D As mentioned above, the laser device of this example produces little ineffective current so that oscillating operation at a high output power of 70 mW or more at room temperature can be achieved. Moreover, the effect on heat generation due to such an ineffective current is so small that laser oscillation can be attained even at a temperature as high as 140 C or more. An InGaAsP crystal having a light emitting wavelength of 1.3µm is used for the active layer of the device of this example, but is not limited thereto. InGaAsP crystals having a light emitting wavelength in the range of 1.1 to 1.6 µm can be used for the active layer. An InP cystal is used for the first, second and third burying layers, but is not limied thereto. Other semiconductor materials such as InGaAsP, etc., which have a refractive index smaller than that of the active layer and an energy gap smaller than that of the active layer, can be used for the burying layers. In order for the burying layers be prevented from growing on the mesa portion, a SiO₂ film or a si₃N₄ film can be formed on the mesa portion by deposition. The SiO₂ film or the si₃N₄ film is, of course, removed before the growth of the cladding layer 4 . Moreover, the InGaAsP InP semiconductor material is used for the epitaxial growth layers, but is not limited thereto. GaAlAs GaAs semiconductor materials are also applicable to this invention.
