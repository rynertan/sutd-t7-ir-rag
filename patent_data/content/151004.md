# Schottky barrier diodes.

## Abstract
A Schottky barrier diode is made from a substrate of semiconductor material by forming, on a major surface of the wafer, a layer of dielectric material defining a restricted op ening through which the semiconductor material is exposed. A metal which forms with the semiconductor material a sing le phase compound which is inherently stable at tem peratures up to 600 deg. C. is deposited into the opening, into contact with the exposed semiconductor material. By heat ing the substrate and the metal deposited thereon, the metal reacts with the semiconductor material to form a body of the single phase compound. A layer of refractory metal which reacts with the dielectric material is deposited over the dielectric material and the body of single phase compound.
