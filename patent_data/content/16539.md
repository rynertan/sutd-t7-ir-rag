# An impact roller and a method of imparting impact blows cyclically to a surface.

## Abstract
The roller has flail member 14 pivotally connected to a roller 10 and also has recesses 17 to accommodate the flail members when inoperative. In operation, when the roller 10 rolls along a surface 13 , the flail members 14 fall forwardly under gravity and impart cyclic downward blows to the sur face 13 over which the roller 10 is rolling. Upon faster rolling of the roller 10 , the magnitude of the blows increases under the action of centrifugal force.
