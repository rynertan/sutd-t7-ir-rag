## Description
This invention relates to inhibiting electrical breakdown by water treeing in dielectric materials which are based on ethylene polymers.Compositions based on polyolefins are well known and they ar used extensively as insulation materials for wire and cable.As insulation materials, properties of the composition such as intrinsic electrical strength, corona resistance and resistance to treeing are important.Intrinsic electrical breakdown ia the catastrophic failure of a dielectric accompanied by arcing or discharge through an ionized channel in the dielectric. The intrinsic dielectric strength is considered to be an inherent property of the dielectric material.In power cable applications for transmitting relatively high voltage loads such as 5KV and above, corona may be a problem because it may lead to the premature breakdown of the cable insulation. Corona is an electrical plasma resulting from the ionization of a gaseous dielectric in regions of high electrical field. Corona resistance is the ability of a dielectric to withstand the corroaive action of an electrical field. Corona resistance is the ability of a dielectric to withstand the corrosive action of an electrical plasma in contact with it.When used as a high voltage power cable insulation, olefin base compositions undergo a prebreakdown phenomenon known as treeing. This type of damage progresses through a dielectric section under electrical stress so that, if visible its path looks something like a tree. Treeing can occur and progress slowly by periodic partial discharge, it may occur slowly in the presence of moisture without any partial discharge, or it may occur rapidly as the result of an impulse voltage. Trees may form at sites of high electrical stress such as contaminaits or voids in the body of the insulation or at irregularities at the insulation semiconductive screen interface. In solid organic dielectrics treeing is the most likely mechanism of electrical failures which do not occur catastrophically, but rather appear to be the result of a more lengthy process. It is desired to extend the service liefe of olefin insulated cables by modification of the insulating materials so that trees are initiated at higher voltages than usual or so that the rate of growth of trees is reduced once initiated.Electrical treeing results from internal electrical discharges which decompose the dielectric. Although high voltage impulses can produce electrical trees, and the presence internal voids and contaminants is undesirable, the damage which results from application of moderate a.c.voltages to electrode insulation interfaces which contain imperfections is more commercially significant. In this case very high, localized stress gradients can exist and with sufficient time lead to initiation and growth of trees which may be followed by breakdown. An example of this is a high voltage Dower cable or connector with a rough interface between the conductor or conductor shield and the primary insulator. The failure mechanism involves actual breakdown of the modular structure of the dielectric material perhaps by electron bombardment. Much of the prior art is concerned with the inhibition of electrical trees.Water treeing is a deterioration of a solid dielectric material which is simultaneously exposed to moisture and an electric field. It is a significant factor in determining the useful life of buried high voltage power cables. Water trees initiate from sites of high electrical stress such as rough interfaces, protruding conductive points, voids, or imbedded contaminants but at a lower field than that require4 for electrical trees. In contrast to electrical trees, water trees are characterized by a the presence of water is essential for their growth b no partial discharge is normally detected during their growth c they can grow for years before reaching a size where they may contribute to a breakdown d although slow growing, they are initiated and grow in much lower electrical fields than those required for the development of electrical trees.Thus, intrinsic electrical breakdown, failure by corona, electrical treeing and water treeing are different and the mechanisms for each are different. It follows that a different solution is required to effect improvement in a dielectric material for each mode of failure involved.Additionally, it is known that when crosslinked olefin polymers, particularly polyethylene, are used for power cable insulation, a crosslinking agent may function as a water treeing inhibitor. When dicumyl peroxide is used as the crosslinking agent in polyethylene, for example, the peroxide residue functions as a tree inhibitor for some time after curing. However, these residues are eventually lost at the temperatures of cable service. Therefore, in order to be an effective water treeing inhibitor an additive must be such that it is retained in the olefin composition at the temperature of cable service.It has now been found that dielectric compositions based on ethylene polymers and used as insulation materials in high voltage wire and cable are protected from water treeing under long term use under high voltage conditions, if the composition contains as a water treeing inhibitor, one or more organo silanes.The organo silanes of the present invention have excellent compatibility with ethylene polymers, high retention under cable service temperatures, and resistance to water tree growth.An obJect of the present invention is to provide a process for employing dielectric materials as insualtion in high voltage wire and cable while protecting such dielectric material against water treeing. Another obJect of the present invention is to provide dielectric materials which are resistant to water treeing in high voltage wire and cable and which retain this resistance under the conditions of use of the wire and cable.A further obJect of the present invention is to provide a high voltage wire and cable which is resistant to water treeing.These and other obJects are achieved by employing certain organo silane compounds as water treeing inhibitors in combination with ethylene polymers in the dielectric insulation conipositions of the present invention.The Dielectric CompositionThe dielectric composition of the present invention comprises, in weight ratio, 100 parts by weight of ethylene polymer1 as described below, and about 0.1 to 10, and preferably, about 0.5 to 3.0, parts by weight of at least one of the organo silane compounds which are also described below.Ethylene PolymerThe ethylene polymers which are used in the compositions of the present invention are solid at 250C materials which may be homopolymers, or copolymers of ethylene. The ethylene copolymers contain at least 30 weight percent of ethylene and up to about 70 weight percent of propylene, and or up to about 50 weight percent of one or more other organic compounds which are interpolymerizable with ethylene. These other compounds which are interpolymerizable with ethylene are preferably those which contain polymerizable unsaturatio , such as is present in compounds containing an ethylene linkage, C C C. These other interpolymerizable compounds may be hydrocarbon compounds such as, butene 1, pentene 1, isoprene, butadiene, bicycloheptene, bicycloheptadiene, and styrene, as well as vinyl compounds such as vinyl acetate and ethyl acrylate. These copolymers could thus include those containing , O to 70 weight of propylene and 30 tot100 weight percent of ethylene and 0 to 50 weight percent butene 1 or vinyl acetate and 50 to C 100 weight percent of ethylene and 0 to 30 wight percent of propylene, 0 to 20 weight percent of butene 1 and 50 to 100 weight of ethylene.Preferred copolymers are ethylene ethyl acrylate, ethylene propylene, ethylene butene and the like.Also included in the term polymer are blends of one polymer with one or more other polymers. Illustrative of such blends are polyethylene with polypropylene, low density polyethylent with high density polyethylene, and polyethylene with olefin copolymers such as these indicated above.The low density ethylene copolymers with w oletins may be made under low pressure conditions of about 150 to 300 psi with supported chromium oxide based catalysts that are modified with titanium and optionally, fluorine, as discloses in U.S. Patents 3,606,736 and 4,011,382. The disclosure of these patents are included herein by reference.The ethylene polymers described herein have a density ASTM 1505 test procedure with conditioning as in ASTMD 1248 72 of about 0.86 to 0.96 grams cubic centimeter and a Melt Index ASTM D 1238 at 44 psi test pressure of about 0.1 to 10 decigrams per minute.Organo SilaneThe organo silane which is employed in the dielectric compositions of the present invention is selected from one or more compounds of the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R and R1 are independently selected fr hydrogen, or a hydrocarbyl group such as C1 to C8 alkyl, C6 to C18 8uL sti tuted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted hydrocarbyl groups with substituents such as hydroxy, halogen, nitro,C1 to C8 alkyl, C1 to C8 alkoxy or R and R1 together with the adjacent carbon atom form a ring of 3 to 7 carbon atoms.R2 is C1 to C8 alkyl, C1 to C18 alkoxy, C6 to C18 aryl, C to C8 acyloxy, C6 to C18 substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy R3 and R4 are independently selected from C1 to C1Ralkoxy, C6 to C18 substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy, orC1 to C8 acyloxy Y is C1 to C8 alkylene, C6. to C18 substituted or unsubstituted arylene or CH2CH2NH CH2 3 .In a preferred embodiment the R2, R3 and R4 alkoxy groups have 9 18 carbon atoms.Partially condensed products of these organo silanes also inhibit water treeing when mixed with ethylene polymer. The condensation products are formed upon the partial hydrolysis and subsequent condensation that splits out alcohol as a by product.For example, if R3 is ethoxy, partial condensation would occur according to the following reaction EMI6.1 The condensed molecules contain the groupEMI6.2 The condensation step can be repeated several times to form a longer chain. These organo silanes are prepared by reacting either an aldehyde or a ketone with an aminoalkylsilane as set forth in, for example, U.S. Patent 2,942, 019, which is incorporated herein by reference.The preferred organo silanes are derived from N ss aminoethyi 0 aminopropyltrlmethoxy silane and aminopropyltriethoxy silane. Adjutants In addition to the ethylene polymer and the organo silane, the dielectric compositions of the present invention may also include crosslinking agents where the dielectric composition is to be used as a vulcanized composition rather than as a thermoplastic composition, and it is to be chemically crosslinked. These chemical vulcanizing, curing or crosslinking agents are well known to those in the art and include the organic peroxide type of crosslinking agents which are disclosed for example, in United States Patents 2,826.570, 2,888,424, 2,916,481, 3,079,370 and 3,296,189, the disclosures in such patents being incorporeted herein by reference.The chemical crosslinking agents may be used individually or in combination with one another, and they are used in crosslinking effective amounts. The preferred crosslinking agent is dl X cumyl peroxide. The dielectric compositions of the present invention also advantageously include one or more suitable high temperature antioxidants for the ethylene polymer in such compositions.The antioxidants include sterically hindered phenols or amines. Polymerized 2,2,4 trimethyl dihydroquinoline may also be used. These are used in conventional amounts to obtain the intended effect in the composition.Other adjutants which may be employed in the compositions of the present invention would include adjutants commonly employed in ethylene polymer based dielectric compositions including lubricants, oil extenders, dyes and colorants, and metal deactivators. These adjutants would be used in amounts designed to provide the intended effect in the resulting composition.The dielectric compositions of the present invention may also be extended, or filled, with polymers other than the ethylene polymer which are compatible, i.e., can be physically blended or alloyed, or grafted with the ethylene polymer. The resulting compositions should contain at least about 30 weight percent of interpolymerized ethylene in all the polymers that may be present in the composition, based on the total weight of the resulting composition. The other polymers which may be used would include polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene, ethylene rubbers EPR , ethylene, propylene, diene polymers EPDM , styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, urethane elastomers, natural rubber. The total amount of adjutants used will range from O to about 60 weight percent, preferably 0 to 10 weight percent based on the total weight of the dielectric composition.Processing of Dielectric ComDositions All of the components of the dielectric compositions of the present invention are usually blended or compounded together prior to their introduction into the extrusion device from which.they are to be extruded onto an electrical conductor.The ethylene polymer and the other desired constituents may be blended together by any of the techniques used ln step art to blend and compound thermoplastics to homogertous s. For instance, the components may be fluxed on a varXtty of apparatus including multi roll mills, screw mills, cQntinuoug mixers, compounding extruders and Banbury mixers. The organo silanes may be prepared in advance or in situ during the compounding step by adding appropriate quantities of ldebydl or ketone and aminosilane. A separate preparation step pay be used for less reactive ketones, and a catalyst such as ammonium chloride can be used.After the various components of the compositions of the present invention are uniformly admixed and blended together1 they are further processed, in accordance with the process of the present invention, in conventional extrusion epparstu at about 1200 to 1600C for croas linkable compositions and about 2000C for thermoplastic compositions.After being extruded onto a wire or cable, or other substrat the cross linkable compositions of the present invention are vulcanized at elevated temperatures of about 180 0C and preferably at 215 230 C using conventional vulcanizing procedures. Evaluation of Organo Silane Water Treing Inhibitors inDielectric CompositionsIn order to determine the utility and effectiveness of the water treeing stabilized dielectric compositions of the present invention, the compositions were evaluated with the organo silanes incorporated therein by use of an accelerated water tree test which incorporates a combination of frequently acceleration and a standard defect specimen. The test utilizes a compression molded dish shaped specimen having 24 conical depressions molded into the bottom. Figure 1 shows F cross sectional view of the specimen, where a is 152.4 millimeters, b is 25.4 millimeters and c is 19.05 millimeters.The conical depression, W, of Figure 1 is magnified in Figure 1A where d is 3.18 millimeters, 9 is 60 degrees, f is 3.18 millimeters, g is 6.35 millimeters and the tip radius is about 5 pm. The calculated maximum field is about 250 kv mm in a typical 15 kv power cable.When testing these specimens, 100 ml. of an electrolyte solution is poured into the dish which is then placed into a grounded bath, usually containing the same electrolyte solution. A 50 millimeter diameter platinum wire ring is then immrsed in the electrolyte in the dish and connected to the voltage source.Preliminary experiments at 8.5 kHz showed that electrical treeing followed by breakdown rapidly occurred at test voltages of 10kv or above. In order to limit the study to the effects of water treeing, the voltage used in the examples was 5 kv. Under these conditions a low density polyethylene specimen will develop water trees at the tips of the conical depressions between 120 and 240 micrometers in length in 24 hours using 0.01 N NaCl in distilled water as the electrolyte solution.To facilitate study of the water trees found, each of the twelve conical depressions nearest the center of the specimen is punched out using a 12.7 millimeter 1 2 inch circular die and an arbor press. The resulting discs are placed in a boiling solution of 0.50 g methylene blue and 8 milliliter concentrated aqueous ammonia 2846 approx. in 250 milliliters distilled water for 30 minutes. The discs are then sectioned and mounted on microscope slides for examination. Specimens prepared in this way have been kept for periods up to two years without apparent deterioration of the appearance of water trees.A typical water tree grown for 24 hours in low density polyethylene under the above conditions and stained as described, is depicted in Figure 2. The growth occurs in an approximately hemispherical region centered on the tip of the cone, which is usually heavily obscured. Because of this, the most satisfactory direction for measuring the extent of tree growth was found to be perpendicular to the side of the cone as indicated in Figure 2. In our procedure all twelve of the stained trees from the central group of conical depressions are measured and the average length calculated.The rate of growth of water trees, dL, varies from their at initiation, when the growth rate is quite fast, to a much slower rate after they have grown large. The data are fit by the empirical equation shown below. 1 dL 0.0240t 606 dt or equivalently dL 2 dt 0.000323 L 1.54 where L is the length of the growing tree and t is the time at which the measurement is taken, in hours.Tf one assumes that water trees are relatively conductive compared to polyethylene, one can calculate the electrical field, E, at the boundry of a growing tree from equation 3 which was derived for the point to point geometry of the present test method.EMI11.1 where V is the voltage applied to the electrolyte in the specimen dish, r the point electrode radius, is identified with L, the length of the growing tree, and d is 3.175 mm L, the distance to the ground electrode. A graph of experimentally measured tree growth rates, dL dt, plotted as a function of E2, calculated by equation 3, ia given inFigure 3.The straight line passing through the data pointa is the graph of the equation 4 dL k E2 dt where k is the rate constant for water treeing, and has the value of 2.47 x 10 11 mm hr V2 mm2 for this experiment. Since E is known as a function of L from equation 3, one can numerically integrate the following equation 5 EMI12.1 to provide a value for the rate constant for treeing from an individual measurement of tree length.EMI12.2 wherein dL, E, V, r, d and t are as previously defined. The following examples are merely illustrative of the scope of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof.General Admixing ProcedureThe dielectric compositions used in the Examples belbw were all prepared according to the following Procedure A Procedure APolyethylene homopolymer of 0.2 dg min Melt Index and 0.92 g cc density, or ethylene olfin copolymer of 0.8 dg minMelt Index and density of 0.92 g cc, organo silane and antioxidant are charged to a Banbury mixer and compounded to a melt temperature of approximatelyt140 C. The resulting composition was then sleeted on a 2 roll mill, granulated and compression molded into test specimens, as heretofpre described, at approximately 1650C. Water Tree Growth Rate hereinafter WTGR is the ratio of rate for the test composition to that of a control. The controls are a commercial grade of high molecular weight polyethylene having a Melt Index of 0.2 dg minute and a density of 0.918 grams cubic centimeter and containing 0.10 percent of 4,4 thiobis 3 methyl 6 tert butyl phenol antioxidant Control A or an ethylene butene l copolymer having a Melt Index of 0.8 dg minute and a density of 0.92 grams cubic centimeter and containing 0.10 percent of thiodiethylene bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamate anitoxidant Control B . The ingredients of these Controls were mixed according to Procedure A, but without organo silane additive.The water tree growth rate was obtained by measuring the length of water trees formed in 24 hours and calculating the absolute rate of tree growth, as heretofore described by equations 1 to 7 . Relative values of 1.0 and 1.03 for water tree growth rate were assigned to ControlA and Control B, respectively.Example IThis Example illustrates the formation of the organo silane in situ by adding an aldehyde and amino silane to the polyethylene in the compounding step.The following were charged to a Banbury mixer 28 pounds of the polyethylene of Control A, 122.4 grams of benzaldehyde and 256 grams of N f3 aminoethyl Y aminopropyl trimethoxysilane.Mixing was conducted until the melt temperature reached 325 F, after which the charge was dropped to a conventional extruder, stranded and diced. A water tree test specimen was molded at 1650C. as heretofore described. Water tree growth rate was obtained by measuring the length of water trees formed in 24 hours. Relative rates of tree growth were calculated as heretofore described by equations 1 to 7 .The data are summarized in Table I. Example 2Example I was exactly repeated except that after compounding the composition was placed in a vacuum oven at 75 0C for 48 hours. WTGR is listed in Table I.Example 9 to 5Compositions were prepared according to Procedure A by compounding in a laboratory Brabender mixer The polyethylene homopolymer and antioxidant of Control A and organo silane.The organo silane additives were formed in situ as inExample I. Relative rates of water tree growth were calculated ed as heretofore described in equations 1 to 7 . The reactants used to produce the organo silane, as well as the concentrations and the WTGR are as set forth in Table I.Example 6This Example illustrates the formation of the organo silane by prereacting a ketone with an aminosilane and adding this reaction product to the polymer.The organo silane was prepared by reacting acetophenone and y aminotriethoxy silane in the presence of ammonium chloride catalyst.1.5 weight percent of the organo silane so prepared was added to the polyethylene of Control A in a laboratory Banbury mixer according to Procedure A. The WTGR after placing the composition in a vacuum oven at 75 C for 48 hours was 0.21.This Example shows that heating under a vacuum does not reduce water treeing resistance as shown by the low value for WTGR.

The data in Tables II and III show that the WTCR was appreciably lower in these Examples, as compared with that of Control B in which the value of WTCR is high. Also, this inhibition is retained by the composition, as seen by the low values of WTCR for the compositions of Examples 7, 10, and 20, which were treated in a vacuum oven after make up. Example 21This example shows water treeing inhibitor properties of the partially condensed organo silane.The organo silane was prepared by prereacting equimolar quantities of benzaldehyde and r amino propyltriethoxy silane and allowing the by product water to react with the silyl ester groups to give about 5096 condensed species. h composition was prepared according to Procedure A in a laboratory Brabender mixer using the ethylene homopolymer and antioxidants of Procedure A and 1 by weight of the partially condensed organo silane. The WTGR for this composition was n. n4 initially, and 0.06 after vacuum treatment for 14 days at 85 0C. Example 22 This example shows water treeing inhibition properties of organo silane having higher formula weight alkoxy groups. The organo silane was prepared by prereacting benzalde hyde and 2r amino propyl triethoxy silane in equimolar quantities, as in Example 21, but the by product water was removed. The resulting azomethine silane was then reacted with dodecyl alcohol so that half oE the ethoxy groups were replaced with dodecyloxy groups. A composition prepared as in Example 21, again using 1 by weight of organo silane, had a WTGR of 0.09 before vacuum treatment and 0.04 after vacuum treatment.
