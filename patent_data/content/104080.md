# CONTINUOUS FLOW POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS

## Abstract
A pumping device comprising two or more hydraulic cylinder arrangements, each comprising a double ended piston the ends of which alternately pump fluid from an outlet in a respective piston cylinder. The pump is powered by a common hydraulic fluid supply which supplies motive power to each of the hydraulic cylinder arrangements and the outlets of the piston cylinders are all connected to a common outlet. An hydraulic cylinder arrangement is caused to start progressively to pump as a second hydraulic cylinder arrangement progressively and in a manner inversely prop ortional to the first ceases to pump.
