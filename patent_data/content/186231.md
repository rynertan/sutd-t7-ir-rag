# ULTRASONIC SCANNING DEVICE WITH ELASTIC BUMPER

## Abstract
An ultrasonic scanning device includes a stator 10 and a rotor 12 pivotably mounted on the stator for oscillation around the axis of rotation. The rotor 12 has two elastic bumper stops 22 spaced from the axis of rotation and spaced from each other. An elastic bumper 24 is attached to the stator 10 and arranged between the bumper stops 22 . The resulting scanning device conserves energy by convert ing kinetic energy in one direction to potential energy, and then by converting the potential energy back into kinetic energy in the opposite direction.
