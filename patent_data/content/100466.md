# Dual band antenna system of a beam waveguide type.

## Abstract
The dual band antenna system comprises a dual reflec tor antenna rotatable around elevation and azimuth axes, having a main reflector 1 and a subreflector 2 first and second horn means 24, 25 for radiating first and second electromagnetic waves of first and second frequency bands. The concave mirrors 5, 4 and the plane mirrors 3, 6 being rotatable around the elevation and azimuth axes EL and AZ and a frequency selective reflector surface means 23 provided separately from the beam waveguide means 3 to 6 , for passing the first electromagnetic wave and reflecting the second electro magnetic wave to feed them to the plane mirror 6 , characterized in that the first and second electromagnetic waves radiated from the first and second horn means 24, 25 are directly fed to the frequency selective reflector surface means 23 and both the first and second electromagnetic wave provided from the frequency selective reflector surface means 23 are fed to the first plane mirror 6 by way of concave mirrors 22, 21 . This antenna system renders the antenna elevation and azimuth angles EL and AZ variable with a simple construction and without imposing any limitation on the settings of communi cation equipment and, also, insures desirable cross polariza tion performance and a minimum of loss.
