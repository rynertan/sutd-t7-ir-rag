## Abstract
Latch up in CMOS devices 11c by conduction of parasitic bipolar transistors 29c, 30c is prevented by providing a voltage drop between the power supply voltage V min cc of the CMOS device and a voltage drop between the well region and ground. By providing these voltage drops, the parasitic transistors are prevented from conducting, and the channel lengths decreased, thus increasing current handling ability and decreasing switching times as compared with prior art CMOS devices.

## Description
CMOS DEVICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a CMOS structure which is immune to latch up.Description of the Prior Art A typical prior art complementary metal oxide silicon CMOS device is shown in Figure 1A. CMOS device 10 is formed within N type substrate gila. The P channel device comprises P type source 13a, P type drain 17a and gate electrode 16a. A P type channel is induced within N type substrate lia between source 13a and drain 17a upon application of a sufficient negative voltage to gate 16a. TheN channel transistor comprises N type source 19a andN type drain 21a formed within P well 18a, and gate electrode 20a. The N channel is induced within P well 18a between source 19a and drain 21a when a sufficient positive voltage is applied to gate electrode 20a. The CMOS device 10 includes N type substrate contact 12a, which provides electrical connection to substrate lla.CMOS device 10 also includes P type contact 22a, which provides electrical connection to P well 18a. The substrate resistance is shown as resistor 15a, and the P well resistance is shown as resistor 23a. In addition to the above described N channel andP channel transistors forming CMOS device 10, unwanted or parasitic PNP and NPN transistors are formed within substrate lla of device 10 Figure la . The schematic diagram for the parasitic PNP and NPN transistors of device 10 is shown in Figure lb. P type source 13a,N type substrate lla, and P well 18a form parasitic PNP transistor 29a. N type substrate lia, P well 18a, andN type drain 21a form parasitic NPN transistor 30a.Because the base of PNP transistor 29a and the collector of NPN transistor 30a both comprise the substrate lla, the circuit diagram of Figure lb shows an electrical interconnection between the base of PNP transistor 29a and the collector of NPN transistor 30a. Similarly, an electrical interconnection is shown between collector of PNP transistor 29a and the base of NPN transistor 30a because the elements both comprise P well 18a. Substrate resistance 15a having a resistance value R1 is shown connected between the emitter of PNP transistor 29a formed byP type source 13a and the base of PNP transistor 29a formed by the substrate lla because P type source 13a is connected through substrate contact 12a to substrate resistor 15a.In a similar manner, the emitter of NPN transistor 30a is shown connected to node 24a, and P well resistance 23a having a resistance value of R2 is shown connected between node 24a and the base of NPN transistor 30a, which is the P well 18a. Normally, parasitic transistors 29c and 30c are biased off, however, lateral current flow in the substrate lla and P well 18a can establish potential differences across resistors 15a and 23a which turn on parasitic transistors 29a and 30a. In the operation of Figure lb, node 24a is connected to ground, and terminal 14a is connected to a positive supply voltage vac , typically S volts. Because resistor 15a is connected between the emitter 13a and base lla ofPNP transistor 29a, base lla is always at a lower potential than emitter 13a, Thus, PNP transistor 29a turns on, thus applying a positive voltage to base 18a of NPN transistor 30a. With emitter 21a of transistor 30a grounded, transistor 30a turns on, thus drawing current to ground 24a through resistor 15a from the positive supply voltage Vcc applied to terminal la. This in turn increases the voltage drop across resistor 15a, thereby increasing the voltage across the emitter base junction of PNP transistor 29a, thereby turning transistor 29a on harder.This in turn applies a higher voltage to the base of NPN transistor 30a, thus turning transistor 30a on harder. In this manner, current is drawn from the positive supply voltageVcc applied to terminal 14 through parasitic transistors 29a and 30a to ground. This action is termed latch up , and causes a considerable waste of power in CMOS devices.In fact, with a severe case of latch up, the CMOS device is destroyed due to excessive heat caused by the power dissipation through the parasitic transistors. One prior art method of preventing, or minimizing, the latch up problem is to provide a very wide field region between the P channel device and the N channel device. In this prior art method of minimizing latch up, the field region has a minimum width, labelled d inFigure la, of 10 15 microns. While use of such a large field region serves to reduce the current gain Beta of the parasitic bipolar transistors, thus minimizing current flow through the parasitic transistors, the use of such a large field region also reduces the number of CMOS devices which may be fabricated on a given piece of silicon.Therefore, using large field regions to minimize latch up results in rather low density devices. Another approach to minimize latch up in CMOS devices is described by Rung et al. in an article entitled ARetrograde P well For Higher Density CMOS , IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Volume ED 28, No. 10, October 1981, pages 115 119. Rung et al. teach that a P well may be formed to a very shallow depth, thereby minimizing lateral diffusion. The Rung P well utilizes a higherP type dopant concentration approximately 2 to sox1017 atoms cm3 than prior art P wells which utilize a P well dopant concentration of approximately 2X1016 atoms cm , thereby minimizing the P well sheet resistance in order to minimize latch up.However, increasing the dopant concentration of the P well increases the capacitance betweenP well 18a and N type source 19a, and between P well 18a and N type drain 21a, thereby decreasing device speed. Yet another approach to minimize latch up in CMOS devices is described by Estreich, et al in an article entitled AnAnalysis of Latch up Prevention in CMOS IC s Using anEpitaxial Buried Layer Process , IEDM 78 Paper 9.7, December 4 6, 1978, Washington, D.C. and by Payne, et al in an article entitled Elimination of Latch up in Bulk CMOS , IEDM 80 Paper 10.2, December 8 10, 1980, Washington, D.C. Estreich, et al and Payne, et al utilize epitaxial silicon formed on a substrate to minimize the sheet resistance of resistor 15a ofFigure la. Estreich, et al further utilize a buried layer to minimize the resistance of resistor 23a of Figure la. The use of epitaxial silicon and buried layers to minimize sheet resistances requires additional processing steps, thus increasing the cost of manufacturing CMOS devices. Furthermore, the requirement of additional processing steps introduces defects, thereby reducing yield.SUMMARY This invention prevents latch up in CMOS devices by preventing conduction of the parasitic transistors. In accordance with this invention, this is accomplished by the addition of a voltage drop means comprising one or more diodes between the power supply voltage Vcc , and the positive voltage supply of the CMOS device. By reducing the CMOS device voltage supply to at least one forward biased diode drop below Vcc, the parasitic transistors are prevented from conducting. In another embodiment of this invention, the voltage drop between the base of the parasitic NPN transistor and ground is increased, thereby further preventing the parasitic NPN transistor from conducting, thus increasing the immunity of CMOS devices constructed in accordance with this invention to latch up and the problems associated therewith.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure la is a representation of a prior art CMOS device Figure lb is a schematic diagram of the parasitic transistors formed within the CMOS device of Figure la Figure lc is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of this invention Figure ld is a cross sectional view of a CMOS device constructed in accordance with this invention Figure le is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of this invention and Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the gate delay versus power supply voltage for several semiconductor technologies.DETAILED DESCRIPTION A circuit diagram of one embodiment of this invention is. shown in Figure lc. The parasitic transistors 29c and 30c are shown as in Figure lb. However, the addition of diode 31c, in accordance with the teachings of this invention, minimizes latch up resulting from the presence of the parasitic transistors. As shown in Figure lc, diode 31c may comprise an NPN transistor having its base and collector connected together. Alternatively, 31c may comprise a single PN junction. The device power supply voltage Vcc typically 5 volts is applied to terminal 14c. Because of the presence of diode 31c, the actual voltage supplied to the active devices is equal to Vcc minus voltage drop across a forward biased diode Vd .This voltage is available on node 96c. Because of the addition of diode 31c, the voltage drop across resistor 15c must be greater than 2Vd where Vd is the voltage drop across a forward biased PN junction in order to cause parasitic transistor 29c to turn on. Thus, the power supply voltage Vcc must forward bias diode 31c, and the emitter base junction of parasitic transistor 29c, in order to cause transistor 29c to conduct. For most substrates used in semiconductor devices, the substrate resistance 15c R1 is sufficiently low e.g., approximately 1000 ohms to prevent a voltage drop greater than or equal to 2Vd between Vcc and the base of parasitic PNP transistor 29c. In this manner, parasitic transistor 29c is prevented from conducting.Because transistor 29c does not conduct, a positive voltage is not applied to the base of transistor 30c, and transistor 30c remains turned off, thus eliminating latch up. A cross sectional view of the circuit of Figure lc is shown in Figure ld. Components similar to the prior art circuits are numbered similarly. However, in accordance with this invention, the structure includes an additionalP region 41c forming the base of transistor 31c, contact regions 57c, 58c for contacting P region ale and N type emitter Sle formed within base 41c. The collector of transistor 31c comprises N type substrate llc. In another embodiment of this invention not shown ,N diodes connected in series where N is a positive integer are used in place of diode 31c. In this embodiment, the resistor 15c must provide a voltage drop greater than N l Vd in order to cause transistor 29c to conduct.Thus, for any resistance value of resistor 15c less than that required to provide a voltage drop of N l Vd parasitic PNP transistor 29c will not conduct, which in turn prevents the conduction of parasitic NPN transistor 30c, thereby eliminating latch up. For integrated circuits employing more than a singleCMOS device, a single diode 31c or set of N diodes connected in series is employed which is capable of supplying sufficient current to drive the entire integrated circuit device. For a typical CMOS integrated circuit having a power dissipation of approximately 500 milliwatts, and a supply voltage vcc of 5 volts, the diode 31c must be capable of supplying 100 milliamps to the integrated circuit. Utilizing standard P well dopant concentrations of approximately 2X1016 atoms cm3, a diode 31c capable of supplying 100 milliamperes is fabricated in a surface area of only approximately 100 square mils.If higher dopant concentrations are utilized, or if the diode 31c is formed in a separate P well as shown in the cross sectional view of Figure ld having higher dopant concentrations, the surface area required to fabricate diode 31c may be reduced.For example, with P region 41c having a P type dopant concentration of approximately 2X1018 atoms cm3, a diode 31c capable of supplying 100 milliamperes without excessive heat buildup is fabricated in a surface area of approximately 5 square mils. This highly doped P region 41c can also be utilized to fabricate additional bipolar transistors having high current carrying ability, for use other than eliminating latch up. Utilizing the features of this invention, a CMOS device is fabricated having increased latch up immunity, thereby allowing the field regions of the device to be reduced in width. For example, while prior art field widths, shown in Figure la as distance d , must be on the order of 1 to 1.5 microns in order to minimize latch up, utilizing the teachings of this invention a circuit may be constructed wherein the widths of the field regions betweenP and N channel devices may be reduced to approximately 0.4 microns. In addition to increasing immunity against latch up, the speed of the CMOS circuits constructed in accordance with this invention is increased over prior art CMOS devices utilizing an idential Vcc of five volts. As shown in Figure 2, the gate delay of MOS devices generally decreases with decreasing power supply voltage for small geometry MOS devices. However, many CMOS devices are powered by Vcc 5 volts in order to be compatible with other circuitry. Utilizing the teaching of this invention, the CMOS device may be powered externally by Vcc 5 volts, thereby maintaining compatibility with other circuitry, while being powered internally by Vcc which is one or more diode drops Vd below 5 volts, thereby increasing the speed over prior art CMOS devices. Yet another advantage of utilizing CMOS devices constructed in accordance with this invention is the fact that P channel devices may be constructed having shorter channel lengths than comparable prior art P channel devices.As shown in Figure ld, the source 13c is connected to Vcc, which is more negative than the substrate llc connected to Vcc. Thus, the base emitter junction formed by P channel source 13c and substrate lic is reverse biased, thereby preventing the conduction of the heretofore undiscussed parasitic PNP transistor formed by P type source 13c forming the emitter N type substrate llc forming the base and P type drain 17c forming the collector . Consequently, shorter channel length between P channel source 13c and P channel drain 17c are safely used in CMOS devices constructed in accordance with this invention without the risk of punch through punch through being the flow of current from source to drain due to the operation of the parasitic bipolar transistor formed, in this instance, by the source 13cx the substrate lic and the drain 17c . The current driving capability of an MOS device is inversely proportional to the channel length. Therefore, with P channel devices constructed in accordance with this invention having reduced channel lengths as compared withP channel devices of the prior art, CMOS devices may be constructed in accordance with this invention having increased performance and increased speed over prior artCMOS devices. Another embodiment of this invention is shown in schematic diagram of Figure le. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment in schematic diagram of Figure lc with the addition of a voltage drop Vx inserted between the base 18d of TN parasitic transistor 30d and ground 24d.This voltage drop VX tends to reverse bias the base emitter junction of parasitic NPN transistor 30d, thus tending to prevent the conduction of NPN transistor 30d. In other words, a substantially greater current must flow through resistor 23d to ground in order to overcome the voltage Vx to forward bias the base emitter junction of parasitic NPN transistor 30d. Of course, the insertion of voltage dropVx may be used in conjunction with the voltage drop provided by diode 31c, or the voltage drop Vx may be used alone.In either case, a CMOS device with increased immunity to latch up is provided, as compared with prior art CMOS devices. The voltage drop Vx is provided in a number of alternative ways. In one embodiment, node 22d is connected to an external pin of the semiconductor package containing theCMOS device. Externally to the semiconductor device, a supply voltage Vx is connected between the pin connected to node 22d and ground. Alternatively, node 22d is connected to an external pin, and one or more PN junctions are connected in series between the pin connected to node 22d system ground and node 24d CMOS device ground . In this manner, a voltage drop Vx is provided between base 18d and ground. Yet another technique for providing the voltage dropVx between base 18d of the parasitic NPN transistor 30d and ground is to provide a back bias generator on semiconductor chip containing the CMOS device. Such a back bias generator is described by Martino, et al in an article entitled An On Dash Chip Back Bias Generator forMOS Dynamic Memory , IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits,Vol. SC 15, No. 5, October 1980, pages 820 825. While theMartino, et al article describes a back bias generator for use in conjunction with MOS memory devices, this back bias generator can be used to provide the voltage drop Vx on the same silicon chip that contains the remainder of theCMOS device constructed in accordance with this invention.The Martino, et al article is hereby incorporated by reference and, thus, the construction and operation of the back bias generator will not be described in detail. The use of an on chip back bias generator to provide the voltage drop Vx eliminates the need for utilizing an external pin for connection to node 22d. When the voltage drop Vx is utilized, the N channel device exhibits the same advantages over prior art N channel devices as does the P channel device of this invention over prior art P channel devices. Thus, in accordance with this invention, the use of voltage drop Vx minimizes latch up problems of CMOS devices, and increases the switching speed of the N channel device, and thus increases the switching speed of the CMOS circuit as a whole constructed in accordance with this invention as compared with prior art CMOS devices due to the decreased power supply voltage applied to the CMOS device.Furthermore, by reverse biasing the base emitter junction of the parasitic NPN bipolar transistor formed by N type source l9c forming the emitter , P well 18c forming the base and N type drain 21c forming the collector Figure lid , CMOS devices are constructed utilizing N channel devices having shorter channel lengths than the N channel devices utilized in prior art CMOS devices, without increased danger of punch through. Thus, the current handling ability of the N channel transistor, as well as the speed of the N channel transistor, is increased over prior art N channel transistors, thus increasing the current handling ability and speed of the CMOS device constructed in accordance with this invention. While specific examples and embodiments have been described in this specification, these are intended to be illustrative only and are not to be construed as limitations on the invention. Many other embodiments of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the teachings of this invention. For example, while this specification discloses one embodiment of my invention which is useful in preventing latch up in CMOS devices fabricated using an N type substrate and a P well within the N type substrate, it is apparent in light of this disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the art that this invention may be utilized to prevent latch up in CMOS devices utilizing a P type substrate and N wells formed in said P type substrate.
