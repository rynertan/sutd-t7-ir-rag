## Description
A HOLDER FOR TRAYS, POTS, DISHES OR THE LIKE This invention relates to a holder for trays, pots, dishes and the like, and more particularly to a holder for seed boxes or trays in which live plants are grown and sold. The growing and selling of plants, for example bedding plants, on a commercial scale is very labour intensive and the storage of plants takes up a great deal of space. Accordingly any device which will allow a worker dealing with plants to organise him or herself more efficiently and which will facilitate the handling of the plants as well as reducing the storage space required at any stage between planting and the point of sale would be most welcome. Apertured frames with legs, which are specificially adapted for holding plant pots, are known. These can beneficially used in a nursery when pricking out or planting out for holding a group of pots together. Also, the pots in such a frame can be carried as a group and can remain in the frame with the bases of the pots standing on the ground or on capillary matting whilst the plants grow to an appropriate size for sale. However, such frames are not rigid and are rather difficult to carry as they have no edge extensions or hand holds. Moreover, when the plants are ready to go to market, the frames containing the pots cannot be stacked 8o any vehicle in which they are to be transported must be provided with shelves. The same is true in respect of storage and display of plant pots which are in such frames at the point of sale.For these reasons, such frames are usually used only at the nursery and the plant pots are removed therefrom when they are ready to go to market. For the transport, storage and display of plants in boxes or pots, trays with mesh bases are known, which trays can be stacked one above the other even when full of plants in their respective containers by virtue of upwardly projecting columns or pillars. These trays cannot, however, be used for holding the boxes or pots whilst the plants are growing at the nursery as the mesh bases thereof prevent intimate contact between the bases of the boxes or pots and the ground or the capillary matting from which the plants obtain water and nutrients by capillary action. Thus, at present, frames are known which are useful for growing plants and in which the plants in their containers can be carried around the nursery although not very conveniently , and special mesh trays are known for transport, storage and display when the plants are to be marketed. However, the plants in their boxes or pots have to be manually transferred from the frames to the trays if these are used at all when they are to be taken to market. It is an object of the present invention to provide a holder for trays, boxes, pots etc., which can be used with ease at all stages, namely for planting out, for growing, for carrying, for transporting, for storing and for display of plants in their containers in the nursery and in the marketplace.This will obviously reduce the necessary handling of the plant containers and reduce labour time and cost for nurserymen. Pursuant hereto, the present invention provides a holder for trays, pots, dishes or the like comprising a frame formed by side walling and one or more crosspieces extending between points at or near the upper edge of the side walling so as to define apertures for reception of trays, pots, dishes or the like which are to be releasably engaged or supported by the frame with lower portions thereof hanging downwardly from the level of the crosspiece or crosspieces, characterised in that the frame is provided with spaced apart upwardly projecting pillars which have, at their upper ends, means for engagement with and support of a respective frame whereby such holders may be stacked directly above the other. However, the invention also includes within its scope a holder wherein the trays are permanently or integrally provided in the form of a plurality of depressed regions defined between flat cross piece regions of a web which extends between upper edge regions of the side walling. In all cases the frame is preferably rectangular with the pillars located at the corners thereof. Moreover, the pillars are advantageously at least equal in height to the side walling, and preferably at least twice the height of the side walling to permit a variety of space saving stacking arrangements. If the pillars are between one and two times the height of the side walling a plurality of holders can be stacked with alternate holders disposed transversely, yet directly on top of each other. Further, if the pillars are twice the height of the side walling, perhaps even slightly more, a plurality of holders can be stacked in staggered array, with every third holder in direct alignment and the two intermediate holders disposed obliquely relative thereto at different angles yet holders of each group still directly on top of each other . The holder in accordance with the invention has, of course, been specifically designed for seed boxes or trays of seedlings. Sloping connection pieces are therefore advantageously provided between the pillars and the adjacent side walling so that holders containing trays filled with soil or compost can be stacked as aforesaid without the soil or compost being compressed by the bottom of an overlying tray. Other features and advantages will become apparent as the invention is described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a preferred practical embodiment of the holder of the invention Fig. 2 is a partially sectional side view illustrating three holders, as shown in Fig. 1, containing trays of seedlings and stacked directly on top of each other Fig. 3 is a partially sectional side view illustrating six holders, as shown in Fig. 1, in stacked arrangement, with alternate holders disposed transversely, but directly on top of each other Fig. 4 is a plan view of the stacked arrangement shown inFig. 3 and Fig. 5 is a plan view of a plurality of holders, as shown in Fig. 1, in another stacked arrangement wherein every third holder is in alignment and the two intermediate holders are disposed obliquely relative thereto at differing angles, but still directly on top of each other. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a preferred embodiment of the holder of the invention comprises a substantially rectangular frame 10 having four upwardly projecting pillars 11, one at each corner. The frame 10 consists of side walling in the form of four shallow side walls 12 to 15, about 4 or 5 cm high, which are joined at respective rounded corner regions 32 to 35.Narrow outwardly projecting rims or flanges 16, 17 are provided around the upper and lower edges or the side walling.Crosspieces 18, 19, 20, which are also provided with flanges so that they are T shaped in cross section for strength, extend between the upper edges of the side walls 12 to 15. A single crosspiece 18 extends between the respective midpoints of the opposing shorter side walls 12, 14, whilst two crosspieces 19, 20 extend between corresponding points one and two thirds the way along the length of the opposing longer side walls 13, 15, respectively, so that six generally rectangular apertures 21 are defined. In this particular example, each aperture 21 is of exactly the right size to receive and support a standard size of seed tray known as a half box, as will be described further hereinbelow. Three longitudinal slots 22 are formed in each longer side wall 13, 15, the length of each slot 22 being approximately the same as the length of each aperture 21 in the longitudinal direction of the frame 10. Two longitudinal slots 23 are also formed in each shorter side wall 12, 14, the length of these slots 23 being approximately equal to the width of each aperture 21 in the transverse direction of the frame 10. The rectangular side walling with copnecting crosspieces 181 19, 20 is a relatively rigid and robust structure and the slots 22, 23 provide convenient handholds for lifting the frame 10 when the apertures 21 are filled with boxes. The upwardly projecting pillars 11 are curved in cross section to match the curvature of the corner regions 32 to 35 of the side walling from which they extend. They each have outwardly projecting flanges 24 at their side edges and a further vertical, centrally located, outward projecting flange 25. Also a flange 26 joins the tops of the side flanges 25 with a further horizontal flange 27 located midway of the height of each pillar 11. A narrow upturned location edge 28 remains above the top flange 26 of each pillar 11. The pillars 11 extend upwardly from the frame 10 for a height equal or slightly greater than twice the height of the side walling, namely to 10 cm or a little more. In the corner regions 32 to 35 of the side walling flanges 29 extend between the upper and lower rims 16, 17 as a continuation of the side flanges 24 and central flanges 25 of the pillars 11. This, in conjunct on with all the other flanges enhances the strength of the frame 10 and the entire holder. A sloping triangular shaped connection piece 30 is provided at each side of each pillar 11, between the relevant pillar 11 and the adjacent side walls of the frame 10. The purpose of this will be explained shortly. Directly below each pillar 11 and each corner region 32 to 35 a foot 31 is formed by a narrow curved strip of material projecting downwardly from the outer edge of the lower rim 17 in the region between the flanges 29. It will thus be appreciated that holders of this configuration can be stacked one above the other with the feet 31 of one frame 10 resting on the top flanges 26 of the pillars 11 of a lower holder whilst the upturned edges 28 of the pillars 11 of the lower holder simultaneously support the lower rim 17 in the corner regions 32 to 25 of the upper holder. In other words there are respective interengaging L shaped elements on the base of the frame side walling and on the top of the pillars 11. The holder as just described is produced in one piece by injection moulding of plastics1 e.g. polyethylene which is relatively pliable and durable. It is designed to be used and re used for several years, but it is not too expensive to be discarded after plants grown in containers supported therein have been sold. As previously mentioned, the apertures 21 are of an appropriate size to receive half boxes 40 see Fig. 2 , which are shallow vacuum formed plastics trays with outwardly turned rims. The half boxes 40 fit neatly into the respective apertures 21 and their rims are supported upon the relevant crosspieces 18, 19, 20 and the upper rim 16 of the side walling so that the main portions of the boxes 40 hang downwards from the level of the cross pieces and the bases of the boxes 40 will rest directly on any surface on which the feet 31 are placed. In use, six half boxes 40 filled with compost or earth are fitted into the respective apertures 21 of the holder and seeds or seedlings are quickly planted out in each box. The holder is then placed in an appropriate location for the growth of the plants with the holder feet 31 and the bases of the boxes 40 resting on earth or on capillary matting. The holder with six boxes 40 in place is, of course, extremely easy to handle and carry as it is simply picked up by means of some of the slots 22, 23 in the side walls 12 to 15. Accordingly, when very large numbers of boxes are involved the arrangement of these in easy to carry groups of six greatly speeds the whole planting out operation. The holder can be carried in the same simple way when the plants are to be taken to market and are to be loaded and unloaded into a vehicle. During transit and at the point of sale holders can be stacked in alignment directly on top of each other with the boxes of plants still in place, as shown inFig. 2, as the height of the pillars 11 allows plenty of room for the plants between the respective frames 10. These holders are especially useful because they can advantageously be used during all stages from planting out to retail sale without the need for removing the plant containers i.e. boxes 40 from or to special holders suitable only for growing or special holders suitable only for eventual display at the point of sale. A further, extremely important advantage of this design of holder is that it can be stacked in space saving manner when it is not being used to hold boxes of seedlings or seeds for growth, for example during transit on return from the point of sale to the nursery or at the nursery prior to sowing of seeds or picking out of seedlings. A first stacking arrangement is indicated in Figs. 3 and 4.As previously mentioned, the pillars 11 are twice the height of the side walling of the frame 10. A plurality of holders can thus readily be stacked, as shown1 with alternate holders disposed approximately at right angles to each other, but directly on top of the pillars 11 of the underlying holders of the same orientation. With this arrangement, each holder is supported at a slight spacing above the frame 10 of the underlying holder by the sloping connection pieces 30. This means that holders containing boxes 40 filled to the brim with soil or compost ready for sowing or picking out can be stacked in this manner without the soil or compost being compressed by the bottom of the overlying box 40. Another stacking arrangement which is even more economical as regards the number of holders which can be packed into a given space is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. As the pillars 11 are twice the height of the side walling or slightly more , two obliquely disposed holders can be located between each pair of aligned holders, one of which is supported upon the tops of the pillars 11 of the other as described above. The obliquely disposed holders are themselves in alignment with and stacked directly above similarly orientated holders. Thus a staggered or spiral array is achieved. It shout of course, be understood that the foregoing is illustrative and not limitative of the scope of the invention and many minor variations in the configuration of the holder, compared to the above described example, are possible within the scope of the invention. In particular, the holder may be made with only four apertures for reception of half boxes or with only two larger apertures, each for reception of a whole box or two half boxes side by side. Also, other means for interengagement between the upper ends of the pillars and the underside of the frame or side walling may easily be envisaged.Furthermore, each foot may be formed by a respective curved corner portion of a continuous strip of material projecting downwardly from the outer edge of the lower rim. The latter arrangement makes it easier, for example, to slide the holder along the surfaces of side by side, horizontally spaced apart, shelves. The holder may also be produced by means other than injection moulding. Whilst the above described embodiment of the holder is provided with apertures wherein trays or boxes etc. are releasably engageable, in a further embodiment the trays may be permanently located or integrally formed. In this case, a substantially continuous web extends between upper edge regions of the side walling, the web being provided with one or more flat, crosspiece regions with depressed regions or integral trays defined therebetween. Further seed boxes or plant pots may then be releasably located in these depressions.
