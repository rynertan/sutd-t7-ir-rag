# SYSTEM AND DEVICES FOR THE CONNECTION OF PHOTODETECTORS AND OPTIC FIBER

## Abstract
The system for the alignment and assembly of optic fibers with photodetectors in hermetic package with glass window and without fiber tail consists of the following processes terminate one end of the optic fiber with a semiconnector prepare a support plate with two concentric seats, each one of them being obtained on one of the major faces insert the photodetector device into one of these seats and the free semi conductor end into the other seat and fix this device and semi conductor end to the relevant plate seats, preferably using synthetic resins.
