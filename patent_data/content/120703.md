# PRINTER HAVING IMPROVED STORED ENERGY PRINTHEAD

## Abstract
A multicopy impact printer has a wire matrix stored energy printhead having circuitry for reducing the power requirement of the printhead. A permanent magnet 60 is incorporated in the printhead to flex leaf springs 63 each of which is attached to the corresponding activation end of a respective one of a plurality of print members 65 . A coil L1 L9 is provided for each print member, being activated when selected, to provide a magnetic field in opposition to the magnetic field of the permanent magnet and of an amplitude sufficient to release the flexed leaf spring. The opposing field diverts the field of the magnetic coil into paths away from the activated coil, thereby increasing its intensity and requiring more current in other selected coils to release the correspond ing flexed leaf springs. A common coil L10 is connected at one end to one end of each of the printer element coils and wound and positioned to provide a field in opposition to that of the permanent magnet. Currents in the respective selected printer element coils add in the common coil so that the magnitude of the opposing field is dependent upon the number of selected print element coils.
