# PROCESS FOR THE CATALYTIC EPOXIDATION OF LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT OLEFINS, AND CATALYST FOR PERFORMING SAID PROCESS

## Abstract
Catalytic epoxidation process of low molecular weight olefins, by means of a bimetallic boron molybdenum reaction catalyst of the kind Advantageously, the said catalyst may be supported on polymeric matrices, for its use in heterogeneous phase.
