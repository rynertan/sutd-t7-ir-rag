# Combination string up and winder apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus and method of this invention provides for the automatic, inline string up of a rapidly advancing filament, particularly a glassy alloy strip, from a high speed continuous casting operation onto a rotating winding wheel. A take up head comprised of two counter rotating brush rollers having selectable interference and speed of counter rotation captures a leading segment of the advancing filament. The brush rollers are mounted on a carrier arm pivotable about the rotational axis of the winding wheel. As an actuator mechanism pivots the carrier arm, the brush rollers move around the winding wheel to contact a segment of the filament with the winding surface of the wheel. A cut and grip device then cuts the filament at the winding surface and secures the filament to the winding wheel. Thereafter, nine winding of the filament proceeds.
