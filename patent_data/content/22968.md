# High capacitance multilayer bus bar and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A high capacitance bus bar is presented having at least two separated conductive plates 12, 14 between which a plurality of capacitive ceramic dielectric chips 20 are positioned and adhered. The outer surfaces of the dielectric chips are metalized 22 and have a roughened or coarse finish to provide contact between the dielectric chips 20 and the conductive plates 12, 14 , thereby permitting use of nonconductive adhesive 18 to bond the parts of the assembly together.
