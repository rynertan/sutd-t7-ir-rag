# Aqueous coating compositions and articles coated thereby.

## Abstract
Aqueous coating compositions are known which com prise as film forming components I a water soluble or water dispersible resin i obtained by copolymerizing A a fatty acid modifier acrylic monomer B an α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and C an unsaturated monomer having a Q value in the Q e theory of at least 0.1, and II a vinyl polymer emulsion as a dispersion stabilizer. The invention provides coating compositions which have the advantages that they are inexpensive and that they provide coated films of good water resistance even when not completely dried, wherein the fatty acid modified monomer A is composed of the reaction product between an unsaturated fatty acid having at least two non conjugated double bonds and a hydroxyl containing ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the vinyl polymer emulsion II has been obtained by polymerizing an unsaturated vinyl monomer in the presence of a water soluble oxidation curable resin ii .
