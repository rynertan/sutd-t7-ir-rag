# Induction motor winding.

## Abstract
The alternating current motor stator 2 of a polyphase motor has each coil 9 wound of at least two separate conduc tors 10, 11 . The terminal ends 12, 13, 14, 15 of each conduc tor is encoded for separate circuit interconnection to other conductors of other coils of the motor stator. The coils are in serted into the stator with a single coil side per slot and ap pears as a conventional chain winding. The bi filar wound coils have the encoded ends connected to obtain the benefits of double delta winding connections. The coils are paired and se lectively connected to each other by speed responsive switch es to define a double delta run winding with the phase win dings connected in parallel and a double delta start winding.
