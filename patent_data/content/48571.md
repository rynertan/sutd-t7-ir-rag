## Description
PENCIL CORE, AND METHODS AND APPARATUSFOR ITS MANUFACTURE The present invention generally relates to a pencil core and, more particularly, to an improved pencil core, as well as to methods of and apparatus for making the pencil core. It is desirable that pencil cores for a variety of forms of pencils including wood sheathed ordinary pencils and especially spare cores for propelling type pencils be thinner and stronger, i.e. stiffer and of greater strength to resist breaking, in addition to satisfying their general requisites of lower friction coefficient or greater smoothness to write, suitable wear resistance, higher reflectivity or darkness e.g. blackness and less dispersion of powder on writing. The present invention seeks to provide a novel and improved pencil core suitable for a wide variety of pencils including wood sheath pencils and especially for a propelling pencil, which core is greater in strength than the conventional pencil cores and can be much reduced in diameter while exhibiting a strength equivalent to or even higher than that of the conventional pencil core. The present invention also seeks to provide a novel and improved pencil core which is thin and stiff, and yet presents a sufficiently soft feeling on writing. In addition, the present invention seeks to provide a method of making the improved pencil core, and to provide an apparatus for carrying out that method. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided, in a first aspect thereof, a pencil core constituted by a plurality of preferably three or more filaments of a core material individually having a thickness ranging between 10 and 250 microns, preferably between 10 and 100 microns and optimally between 30 and 50 microns, and bundled and joined together with a binder material. Specifically, the core material may consist at least in part of finely divided graphite, and the binder material may consist at least in part of finely divided graphite and may contain a synthetic resin. The pencil core or the bundle of the filaments when joined may advantageously have a thickness ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 mm. The core material may advantageously consist of a mixture essentially of graphite particles and at least one synthetic resin uniformly mixed and heat treated.The graphite particles may be particles of a uniform particle size in a range between 10 and 100 or 200 microns and preferably between 30 and 50 microns, but preferably should include particles of a relatively small, uniform particle size e.g. between 1 and 10 microns and particles of a relatively large, uniform particle size e.g. between 10 and 100 microns or between 150 and 200 microns . The invention also provides, in a second aspect thereof, a method of making a pencil core, comprising the steps of a preparing a semi soft solid substance constituting a pencil core material b extruding. the said substance to prepare a plurality of filaments of the said core material individually having a thickness ranging between 10 and 250 microns and preferably between 10 and 100 microns and c bundling the said filaments and joining them with a binder material to form the said pencil core. The method advantageously further comprises the step d of heating the said filaments at at least one temperature between 800 and 35000 C subsequent to step b and prior to step c , and further the step e subsequent to step c , of heating the said bundled filaments at a temperature between 1000 and 20000 C. Preferably, each of steps d and e is carried out in an inert atmosphere e.g. argon or in a graphite powder to prevent the filaments from being oxidized. The invention also provides, in a third aspect thereof, an apparatus for making a pencil core, comprising a vessel for retaining a semi soft solid substance constituting a pencil core material means for extruding the said substance in the said vessel to prepare a plurality of filaments of the said core material having a thickness ranging between 10 and 250 microns and means for bundling the said filaments and joining them with a binder material to form the said pencil core. These and other features of the present invention as well as advantages thereof will become more readily apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view diagrammati cally illustrating a texture of a single conventional graphite pencil core or filament Fig. 2 is a graph illustrating the relationship between the thickness of the single graphite pencil core or filament and the strength thereof Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are cross sectional views diagrammatically illustrating pencil cores embodying the present invention Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic view, essentially in elevational or longitudinal section, illustrating an apparatus for making a pencil core according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view diagrammatically illustrating a semi finished core product which develops in the process utilizing the apparatus of Fig. 6. Referring now to the drawings The conventional single graphite based pencil core is in the form of a circular rod having a diameter D of 0.2 to 0.5 mm, and electron micrographical observation has revealed that it has a texture generally as iliustrated in Fig. 1. It has been observed that the texture has fine graphite grains shown by fine gathers 11 closer to the peripheral surface S of the core 1 and coarse graphite grains shown by coarse gathers 12 deeper inside the core 1.It has been found that as the diameter of such a graphitebased core 1 is reduced, the grains 11 closer to the peripheral surface approach in size and appearance the grains 12 deeper inside the core 1. It has thus been assumed that the finer the core 1, the greater its strength i.e.breaking force per cross sectional area . This has been experimentally confirmed as shown by the graph of Fig. 2 in which the thickness diameter of the core or gra phite filament in microns JU is plotted along the abscissa and the strength thereof in tons cm2 alternativelyNewtons m2 plotted along the ordinate. Each of the abscissa and the ordinate is plotted in logarithmic scale.The graph of Fig. 2 shows that the logarithm of strength varies in inverse proportion to the logarithm of thickness. The novel pencil core according to the invention has been devised with this discovery in mind and, as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 by way of example, comprises a plurality of elementary filaments 10 of a core material individually having a thickness ranging between 10 and 250 microns, preferably between 10 and 100 microns, and bundled and firmly joined together with a binder material 13. Three, seven and five elementary filaments 10 are used in the embodiments of Figs.3, 4 and 5, respectively. In each example, the filaments 10 circular in section may have a diameter and hence a thickness of 30 to 50 microns.This makes a composite pencil core having an overall thickness of 0.1 mm in Fig. 3 and composite pencil cores having an overall thickness of 0.3 mm in Figs. 4 and 5.Electron micrographical observation shows that a graphite based pencil filament or elementary core of such a thickness has a uniform graphite grain distribution throughout its body. Measurements show also that each of the composite cores of Figs. 3, 4 and 5 has a strength approaching or even greater than 10 tons cm2 i.e. 99.64 x 107N m2. This represents five times or more increase in strength than conventional single cores of 0.2 mm diameter which have at most a strength of 2 tons cm2 i.e .19.928 x 107 N m2 . It has been found that the composite core of Fig. 3 of 0.1 mm in diameter constituted with three filaments or elementary cores 10 has a strength of 28 tons cm2 i.e. 278.99 x 107 N m2 , thus being 14 times stronger than the conventional single core structure of the same diameter. Referring to Fig. 6 which shows an apparatus for making a novel pencil core according to the invention, a core raw material 2 retained in a receptacle 3 is forced through a plurality of small extrusion dies or spinneret openings 4 e.g. individually circular in cross section to produce a plurality of continuously formed filaments 10 of the material individually having a uniform thickness as described. The material 2 may be a semi soft solid or solution of a synthetic resin R e.g. polyacrylonitrile resin monomer in which graphite particles G are uniformly distributed and as conventionally is heated, say, at a temperature of 2000 C during extrusion.The graphite particles may be of a uniform particle size of, say, 30 to 50 microns but, according to a preferred feature of the invention, should preferably include particles of a relatively small, uniform particle size of around 5 microns, e.g. 1 to 10 microns, and particles of a relatively large, uniform particle size of 10 to 100 microns or 150 to 200 microns. The filaments 10 continuously extruded through the openings 4 in parallel with one another are passed as a group 5 through a heating stage 6 comprising a primary baking heater 6a and a further heater 6b, then through a joining stage 7 and a final heating stage 8, and are finally squeezed between a pair of compression rollers 9a and 9b which serve to apply a sufficient tension to each of the filaments 10 being drawn from the receptacle 3. The die openings 4 are formed spaced apart from one another with a suitable spacing in a bottom wall of the receptacle 3. The heater 6a is provided to heat the filaments 10 being drawn from the openings 4 at a temperature of, say, 10000 C, thereby baking the filaments 10. The heater 6b is used to heat treat the baked filaments 10 at a temperature of, say, 30000 C, thereby homogenizing graphite crystalization therein. The parallel runing filaments are bundled in the joining stage 7 which includes an opening 7a, typically circular in section, defined by the wall of a metal frame 7b and an outlet nozzle 7c of an injector 7d. The latter includes a hopper 7e for feeding a binder material 13, e.g. a mixture of graphite particles and 10 by weight stylene solutioned in toluene, into a chamber 7f in which a plunger 7g formed with a screw 7h extends toward the nozzle opening 7c and is rotationally driven by a motor 7m. As the plunger 7g is rotated by the motor 7m, the binder material 13 is continuously fed into the nozzle 7c and in turn to opening 7a to distribute itself around the individual filaments 10 and to fill the interstices therein. Thus, through the opening 7a, a roughly joined composite core 20 with a cross section as shown in Fig. 7 is formed.The coarse core 20 is then passed through the heater 8 and baked there at a temperature of, 0 say, 1200 C, and thereafter squeezed between the com pression rollers 9a and 9b rotating in the directions shown by arrows to yield a densified or finished composite core 20. Such a composite pencil core made in the manner so far described has practically the same appear ance as a conventional single core and yet has much greater strength, as described already. The finished core 20 is cut by a blade 15 disposed downstream of the compaction stage 9 and intermittently operated by a motor 16 to provide successive pieces of the finished core of a desired length. It is desirable to conduct heat treatment at each of the stages 6a, 6b and 8 in an inert atmosphere e.g. argon or in a graphite powder to prevent the filaments 10 or the core 20 from being oxidized. The coarse or finished pencil core 20 or 20 may be further be subjected to impregnation with paraffine to improve its quality. As mentioned previously, it is desirable that graphite particles in the core material 2 have particles of a smaller uniform particle size around 5 microns and a larger uniform particle size between 10 and 100 microns or 150 to 200 microns. With these different size grades of particles mixed uniformly to constitute the core material 2, it has been found that a composite pencil core excellent in strength and yet relatively soft and smooth to write with is provided.
