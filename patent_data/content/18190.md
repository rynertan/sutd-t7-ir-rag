# Glass seals for sealing beta alumina in electro chemical cells or other energy conversion devices, glasses for use in such seals and cells or other energy conversion devices with such seals.

## Abstract
A glass for sealing a beta alumina tube in a sodium sulphur cell has a composition suitable to resist attack by sodium at elevated temperatures and a coefficient of ther mal expansion suitable for use with beta alumina. The glass consists essentially of 28 48 mol B₂O₃, 0 20 mol SiO₂, 16 28 mol Al₂O₃, together with 18 33 mol of at least one alkaline earth oxide selected from the group consisting of BaO, SrO, CaO and MgO, the proportions of the consti tuents being such that the combined total of B₂O₃ and SiO₂ is 40 to 60 mol and furthermore being such that 0.0517 A₁ 0.0354 A₂ 0.0063 A₃ 0.168 A₄ 0.1336 A₅ 0.098 A₆ 0.1597 A₇, lies between 5.7 and 6.4 where A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄, A₅, A₆ and A₇ are the respective molar percent tages of B₂O₃, SiO₂, Al₂O₃, BaO, CaO, MgO and SrO. A cell 30 sealed with such a glass seal is described with reference to Figure 8.
