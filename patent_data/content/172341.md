# A POLYVINYL CHLORIDE RESINOUS COMPOSITION AND PRODUCT THEREOF

## Abstract
Disclosed is a laminated sheet comprising a polyvinyl chloride resinous layer and a core layer obtained by dry blending a polyvinyl chloride resin and a cellular filler as main ingredients with a plasticizer. The product of the invention is lighter and superior in soundproofing and adiabatic effects, bending strength, dry texture touchness, water resistance, dimensional stability, cold resistance and the like so that structural materials such as floor coverings and the like are supplied more advan tageously than conventional ones.
