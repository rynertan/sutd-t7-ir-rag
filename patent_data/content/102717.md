# Fuel pressure regulator.

## Abstract
The fuel supplied to an injector 20 is maintained at substantially constant pressure by a fuel pressure regulator 50 which balances the fuel pressure with the bias of a coil spring 66 . To establish the desired pressure, a spring housing 76 is deformed to move a spring seat 84 to the position which causes the spring 66 to exert the required bias. The spring seat 84 is connected to a diaphragm 52 by a tie rod 88 which simplifies assembly of the pressure regulator 50 . Slits 82 in the outer portion of the diaphragm 52 allow separation of the diaphragm 52 along an arcuate line while maintaining a continuous peripheral seal about the pressure regulator.
