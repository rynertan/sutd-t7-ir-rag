## Description
Method and apparatus of processing slurries containing rock The present invention relates to a method of processing a slurry containing rock, whereby water is withdrawn from the slurry by adding alkaline earth metal oxide. Tixotrope slurries containing flotation rock originate from a separating process of coal and fine vein rock. By withdrawal of water from such a slurry flotation rock can be processed to technically and or economically attractive products. The slurry containing flotation rock results from a separation process, whereby coal is separated from mine rock and vein rock. The techniques used consist of classifying, screaning and a wet separation. In one of the latest phases of said wet separation process of very fine coal and vein rock results after removal of coal dust a slurry of flotation rock with a contence of 30 50 kg rock m3. Next to the slurry containing rock with a particle dimension less than 0.75 mm also result other fractions of mine stone discriminated as coarse and fine so called Waschberge rock with a particle dimension of 10 120 mm and 0.75 10 mm, respective ly. Tabel 1 shows a composition of vein rock.Tabel 1Composition of vein rockType Particle size distribution Quantity vein rock 60 120 mm 10 coarse Waschberge rock 10 60 mm 65 fine Waschberge rock 0.75 10 mm 208 flotation rock 0.75 mm 5 The ratio between the yield of coal and rock is in the order of magnitude equal to 1 1. At an annual production in 1980 of about 50 million tons of coal there remains about 50 million tons of waist rock, in which the portion of flotation rock is about 5 , equal to about 2,5 million tons. The storage characteristics of Waschberge rock as waist product are in contrast to flotation rock almost uncomplicated. With respect to slurry containing flotation rock it is for technical reasons for storage necessary to dewater further the slurry with a rock content of 30 50 kg m3 by a settling and or thickening process. The maximum concentration to be obtained with this process is a slurry with a rock content of 500 600 kg m3. The storage features of this slurry which is almost unmanageable, are as a result of the flow features very bad, and therefore it is stored on storage places which are encountered by dikes. In order to improve the storage features the slurry could be mixed with partly coarse and partly fine Waschberge rock, or is further dehydrated by filtration using filter presses. The water content to be obtained is at maximum 25 30 .This blended and or pressed rock is disposed of or stored at heigh costs. The method according to the invention has for its object on the one hand to provide a process with which tixo trope slurries containing flotation rock are transferred in products which are technically manageable, and which products are obtionally processed by a thermal treatment to products with hydraulic binder features. One and the other as such, that not only a waste problem is solved, but also particularly the further thermal treatment is economically accountable and attractive to be performed. Furhtermore it is preferred, if the process is performed directly at the site where the tixotrope slurries are formed, that is at the mine, so that transport and optionally intermediate storage problems can be avoided. According to the proposed method this could be obtained in that the slurry containing rock is a slurry containing flotation rock with a rock concentration of at least 300 kg m3, and that calcium oxide in such a quantity is added as such, that the product obtained on the one side has a moisture content less than 25 , and on the other hand a CaO modulus greater than 1.8. Dependent on the stoechriometrical weight quantity of CaO results, in combination with the rock content of the slurry a dry or almost dry reaction product consisting of a mixture of calcium hydroxide and flotation rock. The moisture content and the CaO modulus are dependent of the way in which calcium oxide is added, because on the one hand the water added is chemically bond and on the other hand is evaporated by the exothermal reaction heat. As a result of this treatment flotation rock is transformed from a form technically almost unmanageable and therefore not to be handled in the form of a slurry, in one sole treatment in a form which is technically manageable. Characteristic for the composition and application of the reaction product as raw material for a thermal convrsion process into products, such as hydraulic lime and cement is, that the stoechriometrical weight quantity of Cao in combination with the Sio2 A1203 Fe203 quantity in the rock is adjusted and thereby tuned on a value of the CaO modulus which is specific for products with hydraulic binder featu res. These values are larger than 2.5 2.0 respectively. Thereby it is accomplished, that the slurry containing flotation rock, originally in the form of a waste product is revaluated to a valueable raw material, using the coal portion present in the flotation rock. The reaction product is technically important for three reasons, that is 1 the reaction product can be transported or stored as an agglomerated product 2 the reaction product can be directly used as a filler for mine corridors out of use 3 the reaction product can subsequently be converted into products with hydraulic binder features, such as hydraulic lime and cement. Characteristic for the proposed method is, that it relates to the processing of slurries with a stone content of between 300 600 kg m3 obtained using any thinckening pro cess. Characteristic to the respective reaction products is, that independent of the rock content of the slurry the specific hydraulic binder features are similar. This is in contrast to the moisture content which is dependent of the rock content of the slurry, and increases as the concentration of the slurry decreases and or the opposite situation. As a result of the process technical treatment the reaction products with a critical moisture content of about 15 25 will agglomerate granulate . Exceeding this critical moisture content leads to over granulation . This phenomenon can lead to a serious process obstruction. The reaction products resulting from slurry concentrations of 30 300 kg m3 exceed remarkably this critical moisture content and therefore are as such unmanageable. With respect to the thermal treatment of the reaction products the moisture content should be within 2 15 , dictated by the process conditions. Characteristic for the application of a agglomerated reaction product as a product to be stored, is that the CaO modulus should be as small as possible, but related to a rock portion which is as large a possible.

These products exposed to the ambient atmosphere will petrify at there outer surface under uptake of coal dioxide, as a result of an exothermic carbonisation reaction, forming calcium carbonate cristals. Tabel 2 shows, that the reaction product from a treatment of a slurry with a rock content of 400 600 kg m3 is a product, that as result of the process technical handling, in combination with a moisture content of about 25 will agglomerate and, expose to the ambient atmosphere will petrify at its surface. Suc a product with a relatively high rock content of about 50 based on dry material is attractive with regard to technical storage. The reaction products from a treatment of slurries with a rock content of between 250 400 kg m3 are specific for the thermal treatment of hydraulic lime.

Characteristic to products, such a cement, is that the binder features are optimal and a CaO modulus of l.S 2.2, aSiO2 modulus of 1.5 4.0 and a Al203 modulus of about 2.0. As the sio2 modulus and the Awl203 modulus of the SiO2 Al203 Fe203 part in the rock is not within the aforementioned, optimal range, the thermal product obtained is classified as a second grade cement. Using an upgrading addition in the form of Sino2 and Fe2O3 rich products this ratio of the Six2, Al203 and Fe203 part in the rock is changed as such, that the SiO2 modulus and Al2o3 modulus pass over into the optimal range. The thermal product obtained is classified as a first grade cement.

Column 2 the thermal product obtained out of the reaction product out of the processing of a slurry with a rock content of 500 kg m3 in combination with an upgrading addition containing 63 SiO2 and 29 Fe203 is qualified as a first grade cement. Column 3 the thermal product obtained out of the reaction product out of the processing of a slurry with a rock content of 600 kg m3 tabel 4, column 3 classified as a second grade cement. Characteristic to the formation of thermal products is, that the process temperature for the production of hydraulic lime is 10500C, and to the production of cement is 14000C. An advantegous environmental fact is, that lue gasses resultig from this thermal process are poor in sulphur. The sulphur portion in lime rock is converted by oxidation into S02 and 503 respectively, and these react with CaO to gypsum which is resistant to the thermal treatment. The method proposed provides the development of a treatment for the conversion of slurries which are almost unmanageable, into reaction products which are dry or almost dry and are technologically manageable. These reaction products consist of mixtures of calcium hydroxide and flotation rock. These reaction products have the features of building mortar and after the thermal treatment of hydraulic lime or cement. An installation of winning minerals, particularly coal, having means for seperating the minerals from a slurry containing rock, particularly flotation rock, is characterized by a unit for adding quick lime to the slurry. The reaction products and or agglomerated reaction products are in principle useful as fillers for mine corridors out of use. Accordingly slurry processing costs, transport costs and storage costs are avoided, whereas according to the proposed method the product can be used at site subsoil. If an installation is further characterized in that a subsequent unit for subjecting the dehydrated product to a thermal treatment these products can be converted into hydraulic lime and cement following the thermal raod, using the relatively high coal portion present in the products to be converted. Accordingly saving the aforementioned costs, in combination with the advantageous process heat economy consisting of energy saving inthe form of combustion heat from the coal portion, the heat released in the reaction using quick lime, and saving milling costs fine flotation rock the costs for lime raw material are neutralized. Characteristic for the reaction products resulting from the processing of slurries with a rock content of 300600 kg m3 is a relatively high calcium hydroxide portion. As a result the thermal products obtained have the characteris tics of hydraulic lime with a CaO modulus which is considerably larger than 2.5. This aspect could be mitigated by dehydrating reaction products resulting from the processing of slurries with a rock content of more than 300 kg m3 thermically at a temperature of 350 450 C. It is to be expected, that the calcium hydroxide portion is completely or almost completely decomposed into calcium oxide and water vapour, whereas rock present does not participate in this reaction. At a single recirculation of a hydratedreaction product in order to replace the stoechriometrical weight quantity of quick lime the rock portion will dubble with respect to the calcium hydroxide portion which will remain unchanged. The number of recycling steps is dependent on the starting concentration of the rock slurry. At a slurry concentration of 250 kg rock m3 the number of recycling steps is two, at a slurry concentration of 350 kg rock m3 just one. Characteristic to the application of the method is, that the concentration of a slurry with a rock content of 30 50 kg m3 to 300 350 kg m3 is performed using available thickening processes, and a subsequent treatment using a quick lime addition in the form of a hydrated reaction product. The composition of a reaction product obtained with this treatment, is 55.4 Ca OH 2, 35.3 rock and 9.3 moisture, versus the composition of the reaction product mentioned in table 4, column 4, that is 55.68 Ca OH 2 35.4 rock and 9.0 moisture. The method proposed will be illustrated in several examples. Example 1 Tabel 5, column 1 For the production of hydraulic lime 1 m3 slurry with a rock content of 400 kg m3 is used. Based on dry material flotation rock, with the following composition is used SiO2 35.7 A1203 20.3 CaO 2.1 Fe2O3 FeO 3.5 Mgo 1.4 NaO2 K20 3.9 and residue 3.1 loss due to burning 30.0 Specific weight of rock 2.0 Coal content based on dry material 25.0 Loss due to burning free SiO2 51.0 Al203 29.0 CaO 3.0 Fe203 FeO 5.0 residue 12.0 CaO addition m3 952 kg kg moisture in the reaction product m3 69 kg kg reaction product m3 1726 kg kg thermical product m3 1232 kgTheoretical composition of the thermal product CaO 77.3 SiO2 11.6 A1203 6.6t Fe2O3 1.1 residue 3.4 CaO modulus 4.0 This product is classified as hydraulic lime with moderate binding features.

A remedy thereto is an upgrading addition consisting of SiO2 Fe203. Example 3 Tabel 5, column 2 For the production of a first grade cement 1 m3 slurry with a rock content of 500 kg m3 is used. A upgrading addition 117 kg is added in the form of a product consisting of 63 SiO2 and 29 Foe203. The CaO addition is 808 kg. Yield 1814 kg reaction product.

It is this coal that at least for an important part provides the energy for the thermal treatment.
