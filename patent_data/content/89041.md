# Use of a negative acting photopolymerizable element as a solder mask.

## Abstract
Improved release proposities are obtained between a cover sheet and a supported negative acting radiation sensitive photopolymerizable composition by introduction into the composition a compound of the formula A B, wherein A is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl of 6 to 24 carbon atoms, and B is a 5 or 6 atom aromatic or nonaromatic heterocyclic radical containing 2 or 3 heteroatoms taken from N, O, S or combination thereof, said radical optionally containing a six carbon fused aromatic ring, an alkali metal salt of α β amino carboxylic acid or a bis alkali metal salt of a β, β amino dicarboxylic acid, wherein said release compound or mixture is present in said negative acting photopolymerizable composi tion in an effective amount sufficient to lower peel force to a value not greater tnan 75 grams.
