# Gear mechanism.

## Abstract
A gear mechanism includes a pair of slidable gears movably disposed between a base plate and a housing provided on said base plate, and a control means for restricting said slidable gears. Turning force from a single driving gear is transmitted to said slidable gears, movements of which are controlled by said control means. The controlled turning forces of slidable gears are transmitted to any driven gears.
