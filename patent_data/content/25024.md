## Description
A MINERAL FODDER AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAMEThe present invention relates to so called mineral lick stones or salt licks for animals, particularly ruminants, and a method of manufacturing the same.The use of lick stones is an effective method of providing cattle with mineral fodder, particularly during the grazing periods. The stones are quite simply placed on the grazing pasture, and the animals satisfy their requirements by licking the stones. Mineral fodder can also be given the form of mixtures which are placed in troughs or the like. This method requires a more comprehensive arrangement, primarily to protect the foodstuff against rain. In order for a lick stone to fulfil its purpose, it must be strong enough to withstand mechanical stresses, be able to withstand being frozen and to thaw out without disintegrating, e.g. when stored outdoors during the winter, and to resist rain, while at the same time enabling the cattle to obtain a sufficient quantity of mineral fodder when the stone is licked.Mineral lick stones are normally manufactured by compressing a mixture of powderous components under high pressure, or by casting a molten mass comprising readily melted components, e.g. monosodium phosphate, sodium phosphate, admixed with different salts of high melting point, e.g. sodium chloride, magnesium phosphate.In the case of lick stones manufactured in accordance with the compression method, one is forced to work within narrow limits with regard to the composition of the stone, in order to obtain the requisite mechanical strength. This method of manufacture also requires the provision of expensive equipment for obtaining the necessary high pressures.The method of manufacturing lick stones by casting a molten mass also has its limitations, because it requires the use of components having low melting points. Furthermore, this particular method requires the use of heating devices. C.f. French Patent Specification No. 2 163 116 .The manufacture of lick stones by casting methods can also be effected by mixing salts, e.g. sodium phosphates, which are poor in chemically combined water, with other components, and then adding water in a quantity corresponding to the ability of the mixture to bind chemically combined water to provide a castable mass. This method requires access to salts which are poor in chemically combined water. Furthermore, the possibilities of varying the composition are restricted by the requirement that the addition of water shall provide a castable mass and must not cause the binding ability to be lost.Gypsum and sodium tripolyphosphate have also been suggested as binding agents for the casting of lick stones. The known technique for casting lick stones is based, in all cases, on the ability of different salts to bind the chemically combined water in a manner to provide a mechanically strong product.An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a novel mineral lick stone and a novel method for the manufacture thereof, in which the aforementioned disadvantages associated with known techniques are eliminated or substantially reduced.In conjunction with the advent of the invention it has been surprisingly found that mineral lick stones exhibiting good properties can be produced by combining the components a calcium phosphate substantially comprising monocalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, optionally also monosodium phosphate, while adding sodium chloride in the presence of water, to produce a suitable, castable mass. Subsequent to being cast into a suitable form, the mass is caused to harden, this hardening of said mass being effected by the reaction between the components forming said mass.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the components monocalcium phosphate, the optional component monosodium phosphate, and calcium carbonate are admixed in weight ratios of 10 80 h, 0 50 and 15 50 , all based on the total weight of the said three components.The sodium chloride, for example in the form of rock salt, is suitably added in a quantity such as to constitute about 10 70 of the total weight of the aforementioned three components.In addition to the aforementioned components, the mixture or casting mass may also include substances normally included in fodder mixtures, such as magnesium compounds, e.g. magnesium phosphate, magnesium oxide and the like, urea, trace elements, vitamins, molasses, sugar and flavouring agents. The binding obtained in the product by applying the technique according to present invention has been found sufficient to enable a substantial quantity of desirable additional constituents to be added, and still obtain an acceptable end product.Thus, for example, molasses can be added in an amount of up to 10 ,0 by weight calculated on the product as a whole, without jeopardizing the mechanical strength of the lick stone.Preferably at least one of the components of the casting mass has a coarse grained or granular form. In this way the amount of water required can be reduced, which shortens the hardening time while still providing a product of satisfactory mechanical strength.The technique accordi ng to the present invention affords the important advantage whereby only a minor amount of water need be included when forming the product, suitably at most about 15 per cent by weight calculated on the solid constituent content of the casting mass. In this percentage is also included any chemically combined water present in the components. Thus, the low water content greatly reduces the hardening time, while still providing a product which has a high mechanical strength and which exhibits favourable prop erti es. The invention will now be described with reference to a number of exemplary embodiments, in which the percentages given are percentages by weight, unless otherwise stated.EXAMPLE 1 10 kg of a mixture comprising 21.0 of granular calcium phosphate 18 Ca, 22 P., grain size 0.3 1.5 mm , 15.9 monosodium phosphate NaH2P04 H20 , 16.0 limestone flour 39 Ca , 12.9 granular magnesium phosphate 22 Mg, 13 P, particle size 0.3 1.5 mm containing MgHPO4 3H20 and MgO , 3.5 trace mixture Zn, Mn, Cu,Co, I and Se and 30.7 rock salt 39 Na, particle size 1 4 mm were mixed with 700 grams of molasses and 400 grams of water. The mixture was then poured into a mould. After one hour, the mixture had hardened.EXAMPLE 2 10 kg of the mixture of the same composition as that in Example 1 but with the calcium phosphate and magnesium phosphate in finely ground form grain size c 0.2 mm were mixed with 700 g of molasses and water. 1100 grams of water were used to obtain the same consistency as in the experiment with granulated phosphate. The mixture was poured into a mould. After about four hours the hardness of the mass was considered equal to that achieved after one hour with granulated phosphates. The lick stones obtained were distributed on pasture land, on which a group of 41 cattle were grazing. All the slicks were consumed at the same rate. The slicks were practically totally consumed after 6 days, corresponding to an average consumption of 81 grams per animal per day. EXAMPLE 3Two mixtures were prepared from the same cbmponents as those recited in Example 1, in accordance with the following recipe Mixture 1 Mixture 2Calcium phosphate 31.6 31.6 Monosodium phosphate 34.8 17.4 Limestone 17.5 17.5 Rock salt 16.1 33.5 Three lick stones were produced from each mixture by mixing 85 g of molasses and 45 and 86 g respectively of water and allowing the mass to harden in moulds. After ten days at room temperature the stones were stored at 23 0C for three days and then for three days at 200C. The freezing and thawing processes were repeated three times. No damage, such as crack formation, could be established. EXAMPLE 4A lick stone manufactured in accordance with Example 1 and two commercially available mineral lick stones having approximately the same mineral composition, were placed on pasture land on which a group of 50 cattle were grazing. The test was continued for nine days. Of the commercially available stones, c 10 grams per animal per day were consumed, while in the case of the test stone produced in accordance with the invention 85 grams per day per animal were consumed 4 stones were used in the test . The commercially available stones were removed and the test was extended for a further three weeks. The consumption varied between 85 and 150 grams per animal per day.
