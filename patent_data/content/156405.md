## Description
ROLL FORMING PROCEDURE WITH SLITTING OF ANGLE BARS AND T BEAMS Y Y YXY O Y J This invention concerns a roll forming procedure with slitting of rolled angle bars and T beams. To be more exact, the invention concerns a procedure for the production of rolled products by which the rolled product is slit lengthwise after some initial passes to reduce the rolled product itself. According to the procedure of this invention such slitting of the rolled product is performed by passing it through grooves of suitably conformed rolls. This produces two rolled products which have the same cross section and are obtained from the original rolled product and which move parallel to each other along the same rolling line, being rolled within neighbouring grooves of the rolls. Procedures are known which are employed for the re rolling of railway rails. Patent US 1,910,271 discloses one of such procedures which is intended for the re employment of used rails or scrap so as to produce new sections. This procedure performs the initial shearing of rails into section bars having different sections.Each of such section bars, therefore, is processed independently thereafter in fact, it is not possible to work such section bars in parallel on the same rolling train since such bars have to travel at different speeds and be worked with different rolling passes. Patent FR 2.356.458 discloses another procedure for rerolling railway rails, in which the rails are not split. Procedures are known which have the purpose of obtaining the division of rolled products so as to enable output to be increased without increasing the rolling speed. Such known procedures employ knives or blades positioned along the path of the rolled product which slit such rolled product lengt nwise during its travel. The two rolled products thus obtained undergo finishing processes within appropriate grooves of the rolls. This procedure, however, entails considerable shortcomings.For instance, it cannot be applied to thick sections and it also leads to heavy wear of the blades employed to slit the rolled product such blades have therefore to be replaced very often. Moreover, it involves the necessity of stoppage of the plant and therefore a loss of output, which counterbalances the increase of output obtained by slitting the rolled product. Another known system envisages that an initial rolled bar is re shaped as a two stranded bar so as to provide a rolled product having a central web with a slender cross section. The division is carried out at this slender web by means of a suitable conformation of the grooves of the rolls through which the rolled product is made to pass. For example, US patent 4,193,283 in the name of CO STEEL is known and discloses a procedure to obtain round sections. In fact, few passes are required to produce a split round bar from an initial billet conformed with the cross section of a two stranded round bar. This known procedure comprises passes applied to a still unsplit rolled product which are of the same type as the pas ses applied to a split rolled product. In other words, the passes to produce two round bars from a billet, for example a square billet, are analogous, as regards conformation of the grooves of the rolls, to passes for producing one single round bar. It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a procedure to obtain rolled angle bars or T beams which makes use of the splitting of a rolled product which has been conformed beforehand with a slender median web. It is also a purpose of this invention to enable output per hour to be increased considerably, practically by 100 , without any alteration in the roll forming speed. Alternatively, the invention enables lower finishing speeds to be employed without loss of output and thus improves the quality of finished products. As we said earlier, the procedure envisages the production of rolled angle bars and rolled T beams. In the production of such rolled products the invention envisages a differentiation of the types of roll grooves employed in the first passes and in the passes after the splitting respectively. In fact, according to the invention the grooves employed for the first passes are characteristic of the roll forming of round bars or flat bars or channel sections for eventual angle bars or I beams for eventual T beams . After some passes of this type the rolled product is split. Next, each of the rolled products thus obtained and having the same cross section undergoes further passes through specific grooves characteristic of the final cross section required angle bars or T beams . For the production of rolled angle bars the starting billet undergoes firstly one or two rolling passes which create a slender web in correspondence with the lengthwise axis. Such web has the appearance of the webs normally employed in the first passes for the production of round bars, flat bars or channel sections respectively according to variants of the procedure. Splitting is then carried out. The two rolled products thus obtained are made to pass through further roll grooves, so that both the rolled products thus produced are re shaped and tne required angular crosssections are obtained. After the rolled product has been split, three to four passes may be needed to produce the required cross section. According to a solution intended to obtain angle bars the two split sections are kept parallel to each other and are reshaped by subsequent flattening. Another solution envisages the employment of re shaping by a rotation of 900, in two successive passes, of a rolled product already partially conformed with an angle. In the production of T beams the first passes before the splitting are. analogous to those normally employed to make Ibeams. The passes after the splitting are instead characteristic of a T beam. In the case of T beams a final rotation is adopted since the portions resulting from the splitting of the median web of the initial I beam become the stems of the eventual T beams. According to the procedure for the roll forming of T beams, it is possible first of all to obtain the conformation of a two stranded round bar and, in successive passes, to flatten the cross section of the rolled product further and lastly to split it by subjecting it to further passes. As an alternative, it is possible first of all to split the reduced rolled product having an approximately I shaped conformation and to subject to further roll forming passes the two resulting rolled products having an approximately T shaped cross section. This invention is therefore obtained with a roll forming procedure with slitting to produce sections such as angle bars and T beams, which comprises a first set of roll forming passes applied to one single rolled product, the slitting of such product into two rolled products having the same cross section and moving parallel to each other and a second set of roll forming passes applied to such two rolled products, the procedure being characterized by the fact that the passes of the first set are typical of the roll form ing of crosssections other than those of angle bars or of T beams. We shall describe hereinafter, as a non restrictive example, some variants of this invention with the help of the attached figures, in w nich Figs.1 to 4 show possible sequences of passes to obtain rolled products having the cross section of angle bars Figs.5 and 6 show sequences intended. to obtain T beams. Fig. 1 shows a procedure by which a starting billet 10 having a square cross section is re shaped first of all with a conformation of a two stranded bar 11. This conformation comprises two convex sections 12 and a slender median web 13. Such rolled product 11 is slit in correspondence with the web 13 during pass c by means of the grooves themselves with which the rolls are equipped. During the next pass d sections 14 of a concave nature and partially angled are created in each of the rolled products. The successive passes flatten these angled sections 14 until the required thickness is obtained finally in the last pass g . In the example shown two passes b c are carried out with the rolled product still in one single piece, whereas four passes are performed with the two rolled products 14 split. The last pass wgn obtains rolled angle bars 15 as required. According to Fig.2 a starting billet 110 has a rectangular and not a square cross section Fig.2a . The billet 110 is re shaped first of all in the first pass b in a symmetrical manner and then in a non symmetrical manner in pass cut. This provides a section 16 with two tips which already has an appearance of two reduced angle bars joined at their web 13. Such section 16 is of a type characteristic of the roll forming of channel sections. Next, these angle bars are shaped further and are slit at the central web 13, thus providing two rolled products 17. In successive passes be f gW these two rolled products 17 undergo reducing passes until their final conformation 15 has been obtained. Any lateral flash remaining from the dividing action is eliminated by the lateral action of the grooves on the angle bars 15. The solution of Fig.3 shows a similar procedure, but in such procedure the two partially formed angled sections 17 are subjected, after the slitting pass d , to a rotation of 900 so as to enhance their angled bend by means of the grooves of the rolls and to eliminate also any lateral flash remaining from the slitting action. Next, when such bending has been performed, the rolled products are brought back to a position parallel to their original position and the finished product 15 is finally obtained with passes f Ig . In the procedure of Fig.4 the slitting is carried out in the first pass. In fact, this procedure starts with a considerably flattened rectangular billet 110, from which two substantially rectangular rolled sections 18 are made at once. Pass c eliminates any flash which may have formed during the slitting. Such substantially rectangular rolled sections 18 are then rotated and flattened thereafter in passes c d so as to form two reduced angled sections 17. These angled sections 17 in their turn are rotated and the angle of the sections 17 is made acute Fig.4e . The sections 17 are then brought to a parallel position in f and the fin ished product 15 is obtained with pass g . This last variant shown in Fig.4 enables two particularly slender slit products to be obtained at the very beginning. Fig.5 shows a procedure to fabricate T beams. An initial billet 210 having a rectangular section with its longer sides positioned vertically is conformed first of all with sections characteristic of I beams in two successive passes l b c . Such section of an I beam type is provided by the union of two reduced T sections 19. The central web 20 is reduced to a thinner cross section thereafter in the next pass d and is slit to obtain two sections 19. The sections 19 are conformed still further in passes e f and are then rotated by 900 so as to form finished T beams 21. In this case too the flash is eliminated by the lateral action of the grooves. A variant of this procedure is shown in Fig.6, where it is possible to see how the one single rolled product 210 of pass a undergoes a more marked reducing action in the first three passes b c d and is slit only in pass e . In this way one pass with two rows is eliminated as compared to the pre ceding procedure. Here too the slit rolled products 19 undergo rotation in passes f g so as to obtain the finished T beams 21. Whether the procedure of the invention is employed to roll form angle bars 15 or T beams 21, it envisages simul taneous slitting of rolled products 15 or 21 which run parallel to each other. In this way only one knife is required to slit the two rolled products. We have described here some preferred solutions of the invention but variants are possible without departing thereby from the scope of the invention. Thus, for instance, it is possible to add or eliminate passes and also to modify the grooves of the rolls employed for the various passes as compared to what is shown.
