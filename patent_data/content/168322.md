## Description
This invention relates to a process for the production of a non toxic B subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin LT B from a human isolate of an enterotoxigenic strain of The present invention further relates to the isolation and purification of the LT B protein and to its use for immunological prophylaxis and therapy. Antiserum produced against the LT B protein may be utilized for passive immunization against enterotoxin induced diarrheal disease. Alternatively, such antiserum may be employed for the preparation of immunological diagnostic tests that are specific for the enterotoxins of Acute diarrheal disease due to the temporary colonization of the small intestine by enterotoxigenic strains of certain bacteria is a major health problem of global significance. Among the responsible bacteria, perhaps the most widely recognized is These Both The A subunit 28,000 daltons is responsible for the biological effects of the toxin but is incapable of binding to its target receptors alone. Through the action of sulfhydryl reagents, the A subunit may be cleaved into two polypeptide chains, with molecular sizes of 7,000 and 21,000 daltons. Of these chains only the larger, designated A₁, is active. The B subunit, which has a size of 56,000 daltons, is essential for the expression of the activity of the A subunit. Apparently it acts by binding to a target cell and then facilitating penetration by the active A subunit. Finkelstein The effects of cholera toxin have been demonstrated by Sheer The precise structure of the cholera toxin receptor is unknown, but it appears to be a glycolipid. This observation is based upon a finding by King and van Heyningen J. Infect. Dis. Once cholera toxin binding occurs, there is a stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and a locking of that enzyme in the activated state. The result is an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP that in some way gives rise to the above ionic changes. Enterotoxic strains of As shown by Gill The most practical means for combating the widespread morbidity and mortality caused by microbial toxin induced diarrheal disease would be protective vaccination. In the case of the enterotoxigenic First, somatic antigens could be used for immunization. Killed or attenuated bacteria could be employed for this purpose, but this approach entails some risk and is likely to be of limited effectiveness. If the cell killing or attenuation is incomplete, clinical disease may develop. Even if this does not occur, protection will be imperfect since antigenically dissimilar somatic serotypes will not be recognized. Secondly, Acres Finally, it should be possible to vaccinate animals with the enterotoxin itself. The immunity thus established would provide protection against active challenge with any of the relevant Although immunization may be achieved through the use of LT itself, the use of the biologically inactive B subunit LT B alone should be almost as effective, and of course safer. The efficacy of this approach has been shown in rats by Klipstein and Engert Infect. Immun. Klipstein In current recombinant DNA procedures, specific DNA sequences are inserted into an appropriate DNA vehicle, or vector, to form recombinant DNA molecules that can replicate in host cells. Circular double stranded DNA molecules called plasmids are frequently used as vectors, and the preparation of such recombinant DNA forms entails the use of restriction endonuclease enzymes that can cleave DNA at specific base sequence sites. Once cuts have been made by a restriction enzyme in a plasmid and in the segment of foreign DNA that is to be inserted, the two DNA molecules may be covalently linked by an enzyme known as a ligase. General methods for the preparation of such recombinant DNA molecules have been described by Cohen and Boyer in U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,224. Other useful general methods have been described by Collins and Hohn in U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,863. Because of their broad utility, these patents are hereby incorporated by reference. Once prepared, recombinant DNA molecules can be used to produce the product specified by the inserted gene sequence only if a number of conditions are met. Foremost is the requirement that the recombinant molecule be compatible with, and thus capable of autonomous replication in, the host cell. Much recent work has utilized Detection of the presence of recombinant plasmids in host cells may be conveniently achieved through the use of plasmid marker activities, such as antibiotic resistance. Thus, a host bearing a plasmid coding for the production of an ampicillin degrading enzyme could be selected from unaltered cells by growing the host in a medium containing ampicillin. Further advantage may be taken of antibiotic resistance markers where a plasmid codes for a second antibiotic degrading activity, at a site where the selected restriction endonuclease makes its cut and the foreign gene sequence is inserted. Host cells containing properly recombinant plasmids will then be characterized by resistance to the first antibiotic but sensitivity to the second. The mere insertion of a recombinant plasmid into a host cell and the isolation of the modified host will not in itself assure that significant amounts of the desired gene product will be produced. For this to occur, the foreign gene sequence must be fused in proper relationship to a signal region in the plasmid for DNA transcription called a promoter. Alternatively, the foreign DNA may carry with it its own promoter, as long as it is recognized by the host. Whatever its origin, the promoter is a DNA sequence that directs the binding of RNA polymerase and therefore promotes the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA mRNA . Given strong promotion that can provide large quantities of mRNA, the ultimate production of the desired gene product will be dependent upon the effectiveness of translation from mRNA to protein. This, in turn, is dependent upon the efficiency of ribosomal binding to the mRNA. In The introduction of LT plasmids from enterotoxigenic Genetic engineering techniques can also be applied to produce the B subunit of LT. Dallas European Patent Application Serial No. 0060129 has described the cloning or the gene coding for LT B from an Yamamoto In other studies, Sanchez Infection and Immunity Vol. 40 1983 pages 653 658 discloses the cloning of the LT B subunit in a derivative of pBR322 pDF87 and its expression in Methods and compositions are provided for the cloning and expression in single cell host organisms of genes coding for the non toxic subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin LT B of an enterotoxigenic The LT B thus produced may be utilized by the methods of this invention for a number of important immunological processes. It may be formulated for the production of vaccines having utility in veterinary and human medicine. Through passive administration, the antibodies from such vaccines may be used for the prevention and or treatment of cholera like enterotoxin induced diarrheal disease in human beings and in other mammalian species. Through utilization in immunological diagnostic systems, the same antisera may be applied to the detection of cholera like enterotoxins. As used in the present application, the term cholera like enterotoxin shall mean cholera toxin and LT, as well as immunologically related enterotoxins naturally produced by Unlike all other LT B proteins that have been examined, whether derived from the chemical separation of the complete LT enterotoxin into its A and B subunits or from gene cloning, the product of this invention is non toxic. This unusual freedom from toxic effects renders this invention uniquely suited for use in immunization procedures. To distinguish the LT B of this invention from the toxic forms produced by other methods, it is designated LT B non toxic LT BNT . The object of the present invention is a process for producing a polypeptide which is non toxic in the Y1 adrenal cell assay for adenylate cyclase activity indicative of enterotoxin toxicity, having one or more immunoreactive and antigenic determinants of an LT B subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin of an enterotoxigenic Another object of the present invention is a non toxic polypeptide having one or more immunoreactive and antigenic determinants of an LT B subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin of an enterotoxigenic The present invention may be more readily understood by reference to the following figures not drawn to scale , wherein FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the production of pDF82, an LT expression plasmid derived from pBR322, into which a 5.2 kb fragment containing the LT gene from an Ent plasmid of a human isolate of FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of the construction of plasmid pDF87, through the insertion into the single FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of the production of plasmid pJC217 by insertion into the single This invention relates to the use of gene splicing methodology to produce a completely non toxic biologically inactive subunit of the enterotoxin of an enterotoxigenic bacterial strain. This invention further relates to the use of the purified subunit as an immunogen for the production of polyvalent antiserum. Such antiserum has applicability to the prevention and cure in human beings or in other mammalian species of diarrheal disease that has as its origin enteric infection by strains of For the purpose of illustration, the procedures of this invention are detailed using one particular enterotoxigenic strain of The methods of this invention entail a number of steps which, in logical sequence, include 1 identification and isolation of the gene encoding LT B or a fragment thereof, 2 insertion of this gene or gene fragment into an appropriate cloning vehicle, 3 transfer of the genetically altered cloning vehicle into a compatible single cell host organism, 4 selection and growth of properly modified hosts that can replicate and express the inserted gene sequences, 5 identification and purification of the gene product, 6 use of the gene product for antibody production, and 7 use of the specific antibodies for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic purposes. The genes for the production of LT and its subunits are carried on plasmids Ent plasmids of enterotoxigenic In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the plasmids of a human isolate of Verification of the fact that the transconjugant produced LT was made by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA , using antibodies produced against LT, and by tests of biological activity as determined by induction of morphological, alterations in cultured mouse Y 1 adrenal cells. The plasmids thus transferred were isolated by the cleared lysate technique of Bolivar and Backman Methods in Enzymology In the illustrative embodiment, the purified ENT plasmid was cut with the restriction endonuclease Once appropriate cuts were made by Transformation of host bacterial cells with these recombinant DNA molecules containing the LT DNA fragments provides for the generation of copies of the requisite DNA, which can then be analyzed for production of LT as described above or used as a source of plasmid DNA for the subsequent isolation of specific gene fragments coding for production of LT B only. The insertion of the LT DNA restriction fragment into a cloning vector is easily accomplished when both the ENT plasmid and the described cloning vehicle have been cut with the same restriction enzyme, since complementary DNA termini are thereby produced. If this cannot be accomplished, it may be necessary to modify the cut ends that are produced by digesting back single stranded DNA to produce blunt ends, or by achieving the same result by filing in the single stranded termini with an appropriate DNA polymerase. In this way, blunt end ligation with an enzyme such as T4 ligase may be carried out. Alternatively, any site desired may be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences linkers onto the DNA termini. Such linkers may comprise specific oligonucleotide sequences that encode restriction site recognition sequences. The cleaved vector and the LT DNA fragment may also be modified by homopolymeric tailing, as described by Morrow Methods in Enzymology Alternatives to the isolation of the LT gene, or fragments thereof, include but are not limited to the chemical synthesis of the gene sequences if known or the preparation of DNA that is complementary to the messenger DNA that encodes the LT gene. The gene fragment that codes for LT B is adjacent to and downstream from the gene fragment that codes for LT A. There are a number of restriction endonuclease sites within the LT gene that flank these specific gene fragments. Thus, a restriction enzyme is chosen which does not cut into the structural gene for the fragment under study LT B . Once identified and isolated, the LT B gene or gene fragment is inserted into an appropriate expression vector, which contains the necessary elements for transcription and translation of the inserted gene sequences. Since the promoter region for the LT B subunit is normally furnished by the A subunit gene and this toxic product is to be avoided, the expression vehicle must contain its own promoter which can be read in sequence with the LT B gene. Many plasmids into which the LT B gene may be inserted contain such promoter regions, the tetracycline resistance gene of plasmid pBR322 and the lac gene of plasmid pUC8 being only two examples. The efficient transcription of the LT B gene or gene fragment is further dependent upon the presence of specific initiation signals. One signal that is commonly employed is the ATG sequence. Sources of the ATG sequence include but are not limited to the Strong translation is tied to the availability of a Shine Dalgarno SD sequence which facilitates efficient ribosomal attachment. Such SD sequences must be interposed between the promoter and the initiation signal, for efficient message readout. The objective high level production of the LT B protein is thus dependent upon the insertion of the LT B gene sequence downstream from promoter, SD and initiation sequences. Numerous cloning vehicles meeting these requirements may be employed which include but are not limited to SV40, adenovirus, yeast, lambda gt WES lambda B Charon 4A and 28, lambda gt 1 lambda B, M13 derived vectors such as pUC8, 9, 18 and 19, pBR313, 322 and 325, pAC105, pVA51, pACY177, pKH47, pACYC184, pUB110, pMB9, Co1E1, pSC101, pML21, RSF2124, pCR1 or RP4. Many of these cloning vehicles contain one or more marker activities that may be used to select for desired transformants, such as ampicillin and tetracycline resistance in pBR322 and ampicillin resistance and β galactosidase activity in pUC8. Selection is greatly simplified when the host cells into which such vectors are inserted contain none of these activities, and one of the activities is lost by virtue of the insertion of the LT B gene or gene fragment. The transfer of the recombinant cloning vector into the host cell may be carried out in a variety of ways. Depending upon the particular vector host cell system chosen, such transfer may be effected by transformation, transduction or transfection. Depending upon the quality and quantity of the LT B subunit produced, one or more clones may have to be prepared. In the illustrative embodiment of this invention, it was necessary to transfer the LT B gene successively twice into plasmid pBR322 and finally into plasmid pUC8. This multiple cloning sequence was necessitated by the fact that while all clones produced LT B protein, the pBR322 recombinants produced low levels of LT B c.a. 1 mg liter and yielded toxic gene products. This toxicity was manifested by analysis in the Y1 adrenal cell assay system, which is described in detail in Section 6.2.2., In the specific embodiment described herein, final LT BNT production at levels 50 fold higher than present in wild type enterotoxigenic As produced in Cell disruption could also be accomplished by chemical or enzymatic means. Since divalent cations are often required for cell membrane integrity, treatment with appropriate chelating agents such as EDTA or EGTA might prove sufficiently disruptive to facilitate the leakage of LT BNT from the cells. Similarly, enzymes such as lysozyme have been used to achieve the same result with proteins other than LT BNT. That enzyme hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan backbone of the cell wall. In the specific illustration of the invention described below, however, lysozyme caused a 60 percent loss of recoverable LT BNT. The application of osmotic shock could also be employed. Briefly, this could be accomplished by first placing the cells in a hypertonic solution which would cause them to lose water and shrink. Subsequent placement in a hypotonic shock solution would then lead to a rapid influx of water into the cells with an expulsion of the desired LT BNT. Once freed from the cells, LT BNT may be concentrated by precipitation with salts such as sodium or ammonium sulfate, ultrafiltration or other methods well known to those skilled in the art. Further purification could be accomplished by conventional protein purification techniques including but not limited to gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, preparative disc gel or curtain electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, low temperature organic solvent fractionation, or countercurrent distribution. Purification is preferably carried out, however, by the exploitation of a peculiar property of LT, LT B and LT BNT an affinity for binding to agarose. Both the complete toxin and the B subunit bind tenaciously to the galactosyl residues of agarose. Thus LT BNT is best purified by the selective retention of the subunit following the passage of a solution containing LT BNT through an agarose column. Once bound and purged of other proteins by washing the column with buffer, the subunit may be freed by passing a galactose containing solution through the column. This affinity chromatographic technique works well with One purpose of this invention is the production of the non toxic subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin of an enterotoxigenic E. After purification as described above in Section 5.3, the isolated LT BNT subunit may be used directly as a vaccine or incorporated at an appropriate concentration into an adjuvant for vaccination. Such appropriate concentrations are known to one of skill in this field or are able to be determined by routine experimentation. Suitable adjuvants for the vaccination of animals include but are not limited to Freund s complete or incomplete adjuvant not suitable for human or livestock use , Adjuvant 65 containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and aluminum monostearate , and mineral gels such as aluninum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and alum surfactants such as hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, lysolecithin, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide, N₁ N dioctadecyl N N bis 2 hydroxyethyl propanediamine , methoxyhexadecylglycerol, and pluronic polyols polyanions such as pyran, dextran sulfate, poly IC, polyacrylic acid, carbopol peptides such as muramyl dipeptide, dimethylglycine, tuftsin and oil emulsions. LT BNT could also be administered following incorporation into liposomes or other microcarriers, or after conjugation to polysaccharides, other proteins or other polymers. The illustrative embodiment of this invention proved so immunogenic that high antibody titers were obtained in mice without the use of an adjuvant. See Section 6.6.1, Through active immunization in this fashion, the protection of livestock, other domestic animals and human beings can be achieved. Such protection would depend primarily upon the production of an adequate secretary IgA response. For this reason, and because human and other mammalian neonates are relatively immunologically incompetent when most susceptible to diarrheic infection, it is preferable that a passive immunization approach be taken. Accordingly, anti LT BNT antiserum could be produced in a large mammalian species such as a goat, cow, steer, sheep, horse or in avian species, and the IgG fraction isolated through plasmaphoresis or other means. This fraction could then be administered to human infants through a suitable carrier or infant food, such as infant formula or cereal. For livestock, the immune globulins could be given after incorporation into livestock feed or a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle. Livestock of particular interest are newborn piglets, calves and lambs. The immunoglobulins of this invention can be combined with either a liquid or solid pharmaceutical carrier, and the compositions can be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suspensions or solutions. The compositions can also contain suitable preservatives, coloring and flavoring agents, or agents that produce slow release. Potential carriers that can be used in the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, gelatin capsules, sugars, cellulose derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, talc, magnesium stearate, vegetable oil such as peanut oil, etc., glycerin, sorbitol, agar and water. Carriers may also serve as a binder to facilitate tabletting of the compositions for convenient oral administration. Of course, monoclonal antibodies could be produced through current technology to achieve the same result. Somatic cells with the ability to produce antibodies, such as B cells, may be fused with B cell myeloma line cells to produce hybridoma cells. These cells may be cultured Lymph nodes and spleens of animals of animals primed by injection of an antigen are convenient sources of B cells, although it is equally feasible to remove these cells from unsensitized animals, and to prime them Numerous specialized myeloma cell lines have been developed from lymphocytic tumors for use in hybridoma production Kohler and Milstein, Europe. J. Immunol. The fusion of antibody producing spleen or lymph node cells with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas is usually carried out with an excess of splenocytes or lymphocytes over myeloma cells that may be as high as 20 1 although, typically, lower ratios are used. Fusion is facilitated by the use of a fusion promoting agent such as UV inactivated Sendai virus or polyethylene glycol PEG . Gefter Once fusion has occurred, the hybridoma cells must be selected from the unfused parental cell strains. This selection process may be readily accomplished by culturing the cells in a medium that supports hybridoma but not parental cell growth. The somatic B cells used in the fusion have limited lifespans in culture and thus will be lost as they undergo sensecence and death, but the parental myeloma cells, with indefinite culture lifespans, must be eliminated by special selection techniques. In the example of the present invention, myeloma cells lacking hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase HPRT After a period of selection culturing, the surviving hybridoma cells may be cloned, stocks may be grown up by standard cell culture methods, and clones producing desired specific immunoglobulins may be detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA or by other tests, based upon the use of the antigen against which the antibodies are directed. The anti LT BNT antibodies obtainable through the use of this invention may further be used for the preparation of enterotoxin diagnostic tests. Such diagnostic systems could take the form of a radioimmunoassay, either in free solution or solid state. Alternatively, enzyme linked immunosorbent essays could be produced, as could essays based on immunoblot analysis. These essays could be direct or indirect, with the application of a second antibody directed against the anti LT BNT antibodies. Numerous enzymatic activities could be coupled to the antibodies, with peroxidase, glucose oxidase, β galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase being only a few of the possibilities. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that there are numerous other ways in which anti LT BNT antiserum could be utilized in a diagnostic capacity, such as in one of a number of agglutination tests. In such agglutination assays, the interaction of antibodies and any cholera like enterotoxigenic bacterial enterotoxins or binding subunits therefrom may be detected using systems in which the particles are coated with the anti LT BNT antibodies. Such particles may be latex beads, liposomes, erythrocytes, polyacrylamide beads, or any of a number of suitable polymers. In the present invention, the source of the LT BNT gene was The plasmid was cleaved by a restriction enzyme to yield a small DNA fragment containing the LT gene. The DNA fragment was then ligated into a pBR322 plasmid, to produce a plasmid designated pDF82. The cloned LT B DNA region was identified and then twice recloned, first into a pBR322 plasmid to give plasmid pDF87, and then into the M13 derived cloning vector pUC8. The resultant recombinant plasmid, pJC217, was cloned after transformation into A detailed description of each step in the construction follows. The restriction enzymes used were the products of Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to completely digest 1.0 ug of lambda DNA in one hour at an appropriate temperature and in a 50 ul total reaction mixture volume. Digestions were carried out by incubating 2 ug of DNA with 10 units of enzyme at 37 C for 30 minutes in 20 ul of buffer. Reactions were stopped by heating to 70 C for 5 minutes, and the overall conditions produced one cleavage per vector plasmid DNA molecule. For Following restriction enzyme treatment of pDF87, the digestion mixture was subjected to electrophoretic separation in vertical gel slabs containing 1.2 low melting point agarose in 40 mM Tris, 0.2M sodium acetate and 2 mM EDTA pH 7.8 . Electrophoresis was carried out at 10 volts per cm, and the slabs were then stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light, as described by Bolivar and Backman Methods in Enzymology The separated DNA fragments were then excised from the gel, the gel was melted, and the LT B DNA fragment was extracted with phenol. Ligation reactions were carried out with T4 DNA ligase from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland. A unit of T4 DNA ligase activity is defined as the amount required to catalyze the conversion of 1 nmole of ³²PPi into β ³²P ATP at 37 C in 20 minutes. DNA ligations were performed using 10 units of enzyme per ug of DNA at 4 C for 18 hours. The buffer contained 66 mM Tris HCl, 6.6 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 66 uM ATP at pH 7.6. To reduce recircularization, in some cases plasmid pBR322 was treated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to Sepharose before ligation. The enzyme used was MATE BAP from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland. One unit of MATE BAP is defined at the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmole of ATP in 30 min. at 37 C. The enzyme was used at a concentration of 500 units per ug of DNA at 65 C for 1 hour in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0. Following reaction, the enzyme was removed by centrifugal pelleting. The transformation of After 3 hours of incubation at 37 C, transformants were selected on Trypticase soy agar BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Maryland or YT plates, using appropriate antibiotics or enzymatic activity markers as described At each stage of the cloning procedure, the As described by Clements ELISA was carried out using two basic methods. In one method the wells of polystyrene microtiter plates Costar, Cambridge, Mass. were precoated with 50 ug per ml of type III gangliosides Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. to improve the binding of the LT B subunit and, hence, to increase sensitivity. The microtiter wells were then filled with 0.2 ml aliquots containing the diluted lysate samples and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Following the incubation, the microtiter wells were emptied and washed three times with PBS Tween . The wells were then treated successively for one hour each at room temperature with monospecific goat hyperimmune antiserum to LT Clements Alkaline phosphatase analysis was then performed by adding 200 ul aliquots of 1 mg ml p nitrophenyl phosphate substrate in 10 percent diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 , incubating the plates for 60 minutes at room temperature, stopping the reactions by the addition of 25 ul aliquots of 3 M NaOH, and measuring the results spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. In some cases, a modification of the ELISA method of Holmgren and Svennerholm Scand. J. Immunol. Horseradish peroxidase analysis was then carried out with the use of o phenylenediamine as a substrate. The substrate was prepared immediately before use by dissolving 1 mg of o phenylenediamine Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri per 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0. Then, an equal volume of a solution containing 1 ml of 0.3 H₂O₂ per 50 ul of the citrate buffer was added to yield a final 0.006 H₂O₂ concentration. Two hundred ul of the substrate was added to each well, the plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and the peroxidase reaction was stopped by the addition to each well of 75 ul of 4M H₂SO₄. The results were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. ELISA employing horseradish peroxidase was considerably more sensitive than that using alkaline phosphatase. In other respects, however, the two systems were comparable. Clarified cell lysates, prepared as described in Section 6.2.1. Once the cells were confluent, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing serially diluted aliquots of the Using the method of Klipstein and Engert Infect. Immun. After 18 hours, the animals were sacrificed and the loops were examined for fluid accumulation. Data derived from the values from 5 8 rats at each enterotoxin concentration were expressed as fluid accumulation per centimeter of ileum. A positive response, denoted by a fluid accumulation of more than 50 ul cm of ileum, was observed with as little as 1 ug of LT. Because of toxicity in the LT B produced by the first clones, the LT B gene was successively transferred into plasmid pBR322 and then into the M13mp7 derived pUC8 plasmid Vieira and Messing, Gene The LT Plasmid pBR322 encodes both ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. When the plasmid is cut by the restriction enzyme Ap When recut with The cloned LT DNA region from pDF82 was recloned into the single Because The culture was then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of L broth. After 3 hours of further incubation, 0.1 ml aliquots were plated on Trypticase soy agar with 50 ug per ml ampicillin, and the resultant colonies were isolated. The transformants were then assayed for the production of LT B by ELISA and for the absence of LT A by lack of toxicity in the Y1 adrenal cell assay. One clone largely meeting these requirements but retaining 1 1000 of the toxicity of LT from pDF82, on a weight basis, was designated pDF87. The reason for this toxicity was unclear, since no LT A could be detected in PDF87 by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, or gel filtration under dissociating conditions. Treatment of pDF87 with The cloned LT B DNA from pDF87 was recloned into the single Transformants were plated on YT plates 8 g Bacto Tryptone, 5 g NaCl, 5 g Yeast Extract and 1.5 g agar per liter of water containing 100 ug per ml of ampicillin and supplemented with 200 ug per ml of 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indoyl β D galactoside X gal . As described by Rüther Mol.Gen.Genet. The Ap Subculturing of strain JM83 pJC217 produces two types of colonies. One, designated type O, is small, raised and opaque in appearance. The other, designated type T, is larger, flat and translucent. It is important for the production of LT BNT to utilize only type T colonies, since they produce 50 100 times as much LT BNT as type O colonies. Because type O colonies can arise spontaneously from the T type, a single type T colony should be selected. The choice of medium for the propagation of After the incubation, bacteria from the Trypticase soy agar plates were harvested with 5 ml of sterile 0.85 percent NaCl and used to inoculate CAYE medium with 0.5 glucose at a level of approximately 10⁶ CFU per ml. CAYE medium consists of 20 g of Casamino Acids, 6 g of Yeast Extract, 2.5 g of NaCl, 8.71 g of K₂HPO₄ and 1 ml of trace salts 5 MgSO₄, 0.5 MnCl₂ and 0.5 FeCl₃ per liter of distilled water. Following inoculation, the cultures were incubated with agitation at 37 C for 18 24 hours. Cells from the incubation medium were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 xg for 20 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant fluids were discarded into Clorox disinfectant, and the cell pellets were suspended in a minimal volume of buffer containing 0.05 M Tris, 0.001 M disodium EDTA, 0.003 M sodium azide, and 0.2 M NaCl, pH7.5 TEAN buffer . These cell suspensions were then pooled and stored frozen at 60 C until needed. The freezing of the cells generally provides sufficient disruption of By swirling the storage containers for a minimum time in a 37 C water bath, the frozen cell suspensions were rapidly thawed. The suspensions were then combined with an equal volume of TEAN buffer, swirled gently to mix, and then centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 20 minutes at 4 C to sediment membranes and unlysed cells. Typical recovery of LT BNT from a single application of this freeze thaw procedure was 50 percent. Further recovery could be made by either repeating the cycle or by applying other disruptive techniques to the more refractory unlysed cells. All supernatant fractions from the centrifugation steps were then combined for further purification. The clear supernatant fluids from the centrifuged cell lysates were applied directly not layered under buffer to the top of a 2.5 x 80 cm Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J. column which had previously been equilibrated in TEAN buffer at 4 C. The column was then purged with TEAN buffer at a flow rate of 20 ml per hour until effluent monitoring at 280 pm reached the baseline level. At that point, 0.2M galactose in TEAN buffer was applied and maintained at a flow rate of 20 ml per hour, while 6 ml fractions were collected. The emergence of LT BNT was detected as a single peak of absorbance at 280 nm that slightly preceded the galactose front. All operations were carried out at 4 C, and when complete, LT BNT fractions were pooled, dialyzed against large volumes of TEAN buffer and lyophilized for storage. Samples of LT, LT B from clone pDF87, and LT BNT from clone pJC217 were analyzed in the Y1 adrenal cell assay system as described The data of Table 1 indicate that the toxicity of LT BNT is drastically reduced compared to that of LT, with LT being greater than 650,000 times more active than LT BNT. The results for LT B show that it, while substantially less toxic than LT, retains considerable toxicity. This toxicity, which is comparable to that of the B subunit produced by the chromatographic separation of the complete LT enterotoxin into its subunits, renders ordinary LT B unsuitable for use as a vaccine. Analysis of LT and LT BNT in the rat ileal loop assay, as described in section 6.2.3, also revealed the remarkable non toxic character of LT BNT. The results are shown in Table 2, wherein each value is the average from 5 8 rats. As shown in Table 2, a 100 ug quantity of LT BNT was completely inactive in the rat ileal loop assay. In contrast, the same quantity of LT produced a stimulation of ileal loop fluid accumulation that was more than 16 times the minimally significant level. Groups of 10 Balb cj female mice source , 4 6 weeks of age, were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of saline solution 9g NaCl liter distilled water , either alone as a control or with a quantity of LT BNT added. In some cases a booster injection was administered one week later. Immediately before vaccination and at varying times thereafter, blood specimens were obtained by tail snipping, and the serum was diluted and assayed for antibody activity by ELISA, as described In a preliminary experiment, the effects of vaccination with varying quantities of LT BNT were observed. The results are shown in Table 3. As indicated in Table 3, antibodies against LT BNT were not detectable in any of the animals prior to vaccination. By one week after vaccination, anti LT BNT antibodies could be detected. As expected, antibody activity increased with increasing exposure to LT BNT. To determine whether there could be a secondary antibody response to multiple vaccinations, groups of mice were injected with LT BNT as described above, and then again one week later with a similar dose. The results are shown in Table 4. The data in Table 4 show that anti LT BNT activity could be detected only in animals that had been injected with LT BNT. This activity increased markedly following a second challenge with LT BNT. In contrast, when no LT BNT booster was given, the increase in antibody titer, while substantial, was much lower. That the antibody activity produced in response to challenge by LT BNT was persistent was shown in an experiment in which 10 Balb cj female mice were injected with 10 ug of LT BNT in saline solution without adjuvant. At various times thereafter, tail snip blood samples were analyzed for anti LT BNT antibody activity by horseradish peroxidase ELISA. As shown in Table 5, antibody activity reached a peak at two weeks after immunization but remained substantial even after 20 weeks. This strong and persistent response was seen even though no booster was administered and no adjuvant was used. Antiserum was produced in a 6 month old outbred goat by injecting 2 mg of purified LT BNT subcutaneously, using standard methods. An identical booster vaccination was given 4 weeks later, and blood samples were harvested 10 weeks after the initial vaccination. Blood thus collected was allowed to clot, the clot was sedimented by centrifugation at 5,000 xg for 30 minutes, and the resulting serum was treated with 50 ammonium sulfate overnight at 4 C. The precipitate that formed was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 xg for 5 minutes, and the pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of TEAN buffer Section 6.4.2 , and dialyzed three times for a total of 24 hours at 4 C against 200X volumes of the same buffer. To render the resulting antiserum highly specific for LT BNT, the preparation was twice purified by affinity chromatography. For this purification procedure, LT BNT Sepharose and CT B Sepharose were prepared by covalently binding purified LT BNT or CT B List Biological Laboratories, Inc. to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ , according to the manufacturer s instructions. The dialyzed antiserum was first passed through a 1.5 x 18 cm column of LT BNT Sepharose , which was washed extensively with TEAN buffer. Immunoglobulins that had bound to the immobilized LT BNT were then eluted from the column with 0.2 M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.5, which was neutralized with 0.25 M Tris as collected. The eluted immunoglobulins were dialyzed against TEAN buffer as described, To obtain spleen cells that can be made to produce antibodies against LT BNT, 6 8 week old Balb c mice Jackson Laboratories were sacrificed and the spleens were aseptically removed. Single cell suspensions were obtained by forcing the spleens through a wire mesh Collector, E C Apparatus Corp., St. Petersburg, Fla . The splenocytes thus prepared were exposed to 1 ug ml sterile LT BNT in complete Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM with 4,500 mg liter glucose, 20 fetal bovine serum, 10 NCTC 109, 1 nonessential amino acids, 100 units ml penicillin, 100 ug ml streptomycin, 0.3 mM 8 bromoguanosine, 5X10 TCM, which is required for the successful After 4 days of incubation in 10 CO₂ at 37 C, the LT BNT treated splenocytes were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000xg for 10 minutes. To produce hybridomas, they were then mixed in a four fold excess with murine myeloma cells X63 Ag 8.653 , and fusion was facilitated by the addition of 40 polyethylene glycol PEG 1300, MCB Chemicals and 5 dimethylsulfoxide. Following one minute of gentle mixing at 25 C, the suspension was slowly diluted with DMEM, and the cells were removed from the medium by centrifugation. The cells were then suspended in complete DMEM that had been supplemented with 5x10 Limiting dilution cloning was performed by diluting desired hybridoma cells to concentrations of 500, 50 and 5 cells ml in complete DMEM supplemented with 40 TCM, and plating aliquots of the suspensions in the multi well tissue culture dishes. Medium over the clones was then retested by ELISA after 2 to 3 weeks of incubation, and positive clones were expanded by subculturing in the same medium. Cloning in agarose was carried out essentially as described by Coffino and Scharff Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA To produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic tests or for other purposes, the hybridoma cells were grown as ascites tumors. Eight week old BALB c mice were primed with Pristane 0.5 ml mouse, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. , and then injected 10 days later with 10⁷ hybridoma cells. Ascites fluid, which developed in 7 to 10 days, was tapped with an 18 gauge syringe needle inserted into the abdomen of anesthetized animals. This fluid was then clarified by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 10 minutes, preserved by the audition of 0.1 sodium azide and stored at 4 C. To determine whether antiserum to LT BNT could neutralize the activity of the enterotoxins of In section 6.2.1, Samples containing antibodies to be analyzed, such as goat, human or mouse serum or murine hybridoma supernatant, were then diluted in PBS containing 0.5 gelatin and added in 100 ul aliquots to the antigen coated wells. The plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 C, the supernatant fluids were removed, and the wells were washed three times with PBS T. Then, a second antibody anti goat, human, or mouse immunoglobulin antiserum as appropriate coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the wells in 100 ul aliquots, and the plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 C. After the second antibody incubation, the plates were washed with PBS T, and 200 ul aliquots of substrate 1 mg O phenylenediamine in 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, with 0.006 H₂O₂ were added to the wells. After a 30 minute incubation at 25 C, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 75 ul of 4 M H₂SO₄. The absorbances of the contents of the wells were then measured at 492 nm. Positive samples were taken to be those whose absorbance was at least twice that of controls, to which no primary antibodies had been added. In a demonstration of the method, serum samples were collected from children and adults and analyzed for the presence of antibodies to LT BNT, as shown in Table 7. The data in Table 7 are based upon the analysis of blood samples taken from individuals in the indicated age categories or from health care professionals working in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at The University of Rochester Medical Center. As might be expected for children with limited exposure histories, incidences of antibodies to LT BNT were low. Incidences were somewhat higher for the general adult population, and higher still for the pediatric health professional group. The serum of 7 of 9 individuals from the latter group was positive, a finding not unexpected in view of the high probability of their contacting patients presenting enterotoxigenic diarrheal disease. Mixtures of proteins containing LT or LT B can be separated electrophoretically and the holotoxins or B subunits can be identified by the immunoblot method. As an illustration of the method, 10 ug of LT BNT was subjected to stacking sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the method of Laemmli Nature Following electrophoresis, the gel was soaked for 45 minutes at 4 C in an electroelution buffer containing 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.3, with 192 mM glycine and 20 methanol. The proteins were transferred from the swollen gel to nitrocellulose paper BA 85, Schleicher and Schuell by electrophoresis in a Hoeffer Scientific Transphor electrotransfer unit, using the maximum amperage for two hours at 4 C. To detect the LT BNT, the nitrocellulose sheet was developed two ways. One section of the sheet was stained with Amido Black to reveal all transferred proteins. The remaining section of the sheet was soaked overnight at 4 C in PBS buffer containing 0.1 sodium azide and 1 ovalbumin PBS Az O to block the remaining protein binding sites. The blocked nitrocellulose was then washed three times, for 10 minutes each, with PBS T. Lanes containing LT BNT were exposed for 2 hours at room temperature, either to affinity chromatographically purified goat anti LT BNT antiserum Section 6.6.2 or to serum depleted of LT BNT binding antibodies by affinity chromatography. These serum preparations had been diluted 1 500 and 1 10⁶, respectively, with PBS Az O prior to use. After the exposure to the sera was complete, the sheets were washed three times for 10 minutes each with PBS T and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase linked anti goat immunoglobulin, diluted 1,000 fold with PBS containing 1 ovalbumin. The sheets were again washed for three 10 minute periods with PBS T, after which they were incubated with substrate 0.3 mg 3,3 diaminobenzidine HCl ml of 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, with 0.005 H₂O₂ for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was stopped by immersing the sheets in water and air drying them, and the locations of LT BNT were indicated by brown bands. Latex beads coated with either antigen or antibody can be used to detect the corresponding specific antibody or antigen. To carry out the test to detect antibodies to LT BNT, 0.8 u latex beads Difco Laboratories, Detroit Mich. were added to an equal volume of 1 ug ml purified LT BNT in 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 8.2, with 0.15 M NaCl. The suspension was incubated for two hours at 37 C with gentle shaking, to ensure effective bead coating. After the incubation, the beads were washed by gentle centrifugation for 12 minutes at 1000xg. The supernatant fluid was replaced with PBS containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin, and Bromphenol Blue and sodium azide were added to the suspension, to final concentrations of 0.04 and 0.1 , respectively. To carry out the agglutination assay for anti LT BNT antibodies, 5 ul of the sensitized bead suspension was mixed with 15 ul of PBS control buffer or a test sample diluted with PBS. Agglutination, which was read immediately after mixing, was defined as a change from a milky control suspension to a particulate suspension with a cleared background. The agglutination assay was also applied to the detection of LT BNT in samples by sensitizing the beads in an equal volume of the glycine buffer containing 0.25 mg ml affinity purified goat antiserum or 0.1 mg ml murine monoclonal antibodies to LT BNT.
