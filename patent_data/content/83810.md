A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said aerator device 14 comprises a hollow casing for containing a plurality of balls, said device being provided with a first inlet for the compressed air 15 , a second inlet for the soap 8 solution, and a single outlet 17 for delivering the foam to said manually operated brush 20 . 3. A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised by further comprising a pistol 26 fed with compressed air and water for generally rinsing the vehicle bod. 4. A plant as claimed in claim 3, characterised by comprising a was solution source 2 and means 3, 12, 21, 22 for feeding said wax solutic said pistol 26 together with said water and said compressed air. 5. A plant as claimed in claim 3, characterised by comprising ar engine detergent solution sotsrce 3, and means 10, 13, 24 for feeding said detergellt solution ttl said pistol 26 together with said compressed air. 6. A plant as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised by comprising a brash 35 from the main compressed air conduit 7 for operating a vacuum cleaner 39 by the Venturi principle. 7. A plant as claimed in the preceding claims,characterised by Comprising normally Closed sclenf id valves 11 13, 16, 30, 34, 36 disposed in the various conduits 8 10, 15, 29, 33, 35 , and pushbutton means 41 44 for the controlled opening c,f said valves in accordance with a predetermined programme.

## Description
terminating in a grip 25 of a pistol indicated overall by 26.To said grip 25 there are also connected a flexible hose 27, connected by a connector 2 to a conduit 29 fitted with a normally closed solenoid valve 30 and branching from the main air conduit 7, and a flexible hose 31 connected by a connector 32 to a conduit 33 which is fitted with a normally closed solenoid valve 34 and feeds water originating from a suitable source.The main air conduit 7 also comprises a further branch 35 fitted with a normally closed solenoid valve 36 and connected by a connector 37 to a flexible hose 38 carrying a vacuum cleaner 39 operating on the Venturi principle.The timed opening of the various solenoid valves is determined b operating pushbuttons provided on a control panel 40.Operation of the pushbutton 41 energised and opens the solenoid valves 11 and 16, with consequent feed of compressed air and soap solution into the aerator device 14, to form foam which travels through t r . conduit 17 r.d e 19 to the brush 20 for applving soap to the vehicle body, wit resultant removal of most of the dirt therefrom.On termination of this first operation the solenoid valves 11 and 16 can be de energised by the action of a suitable timer. r. t h wn , the pushbutton 42 is operated to e er ise krf Tper the solenoid valves 34 and 30, with consequent feed of water and wax solution to the pistol 26 through the hoses 31 and 27, for rinsing and waxing the vehicle body.Operation of the pushbutton 43 energises and opens the solenoid valves 30 and 13 for washing the engine without using water the detergent solution used for the engine contains no water in order to prevent any possible short circuiting .Finally, operation of the pushbutteln 44 energises and opens the solenoid valve 36 for operating the vacuum cleaner 39 by way of hoses 38, in order to allow internal cleaning of the vehicle.As can be seen from Figure 1, the various plant components, with the obvious exception of the hoses, can be contained in a case 45 of small overall size, while the hoses and the parts connected thereto 20, 26, 39 can be brought to the washing zone possibly Ly means of a swivelling bren. If required, the control panel 40 can be fitted with a sllita Plant for manually washing motor vehicles with minimum water consumptionThe present invention relates to a plant for manually washing motor vehicles, the combination and configuration of its component parts being such as to enable through cleaning to be attained with minimum water consumption.According to the inventions thF plant comprises , in combination, an aerator device arranged to feed to a manually operated brush a foam prepared by intimately mixing compressed air with a soap solution a pistol for releasing a jet of air mixed with water for rinsing the entire vehicle body, with the possible addition of wax polish a vacuum cleaner operating on the Venturi principle using air as the drive fluid and a device for controlling the various components, either on a time basis or otherwise.The ,invention is illustrated by way of example in the figures of the single accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a diagram showing the plant in terms of its components and Figures 2, 3 and 4 are diagrammatic views of the pistol, brush and vacuum cleaner.With reference to the said figures, the plant comprises three vessels 1, 2 and 3 for containing a soap solution, a wax solution and an engine wash detergent solution respectively.The three vessels are kept under pressure by conduits 4, 5 and 6 deriving from a main compressed air conduit 7, each vessel being provided with delivery conduits 8, 9 and 10, each fitted with a normally closed solenoid valve 11, 12 and 13.The delivery conduit 8 opens into an aerator device 14 consisting of a hollow casing containing a plurality of glass balls, into which there also opens a conduit 15 branching from the air conduit 7 and fitted with a normally closed solenoid, valve 16. An outlet conduit 17 from the aerator device 14 is connected by way of a connector 18 to a flexible hose 19 carrying a manually operated brush 20. The dt 1 verv condl lt 9 is connected ty a connector 21 t ., a flexibly hose 22, and the delivery conduit 10 is connected by a connector 23 to a flexible hose 24, said hoses 22 rid 24 ble coin bow for operating the various pushbuttons for C. n trolling the various wash stages From the aforegoing it is apparent that the plant is compact and water consumption is very low, being limited only to the rinsing stage, the actual cleaning stage being carried out using foam formed by means of the aerator device. In a modification which is not illustrated but which falls within the scope of the present invention, the solutions contained in the vessels 1, 2 and 3 can be delivered by suction, using Venturi valves which utilise compressed air as the drive fluid.
