# Apparatus for bending elongate workpieces.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for bending an elongated workpiece such as a protective moulding for a mo tor vehicle. The workpiece is fed to and held by feeding rolls 15 and gripping rolls 61 which are spaced from each other, and undergoes bending by displacing the gripping rolls in direc tions perpendicular to the feed direction of the workpiece and twisting by rotating the gripping rolls about the longitudinal axis of the workpiece.
