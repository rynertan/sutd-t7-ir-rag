# OXIDATIVE REMOVAL OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE FROM GAS STREAMS

## Abstract
A process for recovering elemental sulfur from a hyd rogen sulfide containing gas stream by reacting the hyd rogen sulfide in the gas stream with a buffered aqueous solution enriched in thiosulfate ions at an initial pH between about 4.5 and 6.5 for residence time to sufficiently react a portion of the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. The elemental sulfur is then removed and the solution now lean in thiosulfate ions is regenerated by the oxidation of the remaining hydrogen sulfide in the gas stream to deplete the hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream and to regenerate the liquid solution for recycling to the reduction zone.
