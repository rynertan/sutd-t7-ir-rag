# DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING THE RELATIVE ANGLE BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF A SEMITRAILER VEHICLE

## Abstract
This device controls the relative angle between two parts of a semitrailer vehicle, particularly in the instance of a vehicle comprising a tractor 1 towing a semitrailer 4 connected to it by means of a vestibular swivel base 5 , such as with large passenger transport road vehicles. The device comprises a pair of pistons 13, 14 intercon necting the main frames of the parts or units 1, 4 which make up the vehicle, said pistons being located at the region of the swivel base symmetrically about the swivel axis thereof. A steering angle detecting system 8, 9 22 26 controls the front steering wheels of the tractor 1 and those of the semitrailer 4 which are also of the steering type, and on detecting that the steering angle of the semitrailer 4 ex ceeds the tractor 1 steering angle, activates the hydraulic circuit connecting the two pistons 13 14 to prevent said angle from increasing.
