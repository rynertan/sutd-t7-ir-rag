# Optical fibre coupling assemblies.

## Abstract
A coupling between an optical fibre 1 and an opto electronic device e.g. a semiconductor laser 2 is located within a hermetically sealed housing 3,6 . The device is supported on a header 14 mounted on the front wall 3 of the housing, the lead 16 to the device passes through the housing wall via a glass to metal seal 17,19,20 , and the fibre is soldered into a ferrule 10 which is inserted through a boss 4 on the front housing wall. After alignment of the fibre with the device, the ferrule is clamped in position by two parallel sets of screws 11 a , 11 b inserted through the boss, and is then soldered to the boss. The housing, header, ferrule and metal component s of the glass to metal seal are all formed of the same metal, preferably gold plated copper, to avoid differential expansion.
