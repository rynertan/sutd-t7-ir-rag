The air guide openings of the first group guide members are larger than the air guide opening of the nozzle mounted member and gradually reduced in diameter with increase of distance from the nozzle mounted member. The air guide openings of the second group members are identical to each other and to the air guide opening of the nozzle mounted air guide member.
