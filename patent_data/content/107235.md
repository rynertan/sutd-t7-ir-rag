# Magnetic tape scanning device and method of manufacturing such a device.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape scanning device for a helicalscan mag netic tape recorder comprises two scanning means in the form of a stationary part 5 and a magnetic head support 4 which is rotatable relative thereto, the contactless transfer of video signals from and to the magnetic heads 3 between the said stationary and rotary parts being achieved via a rotary transformer comprising a rotating transformer ring 11A on the rotary head support and a stationary transformer ring 11B on the stationary part, which stationary ring is spaced from the rotating ring by a narrow air gap b . The transformer rings are adhesively secured to the two scanning means by supports 13 , which are received with clearance in through bores 22 in the scanning means and each of which is connected to the relevant scanning means by a layer of adhesive 18 which is si tuated only between the inner wall of the respective through bore 22 and the cylindrical surface 14 of the support.
