## Description
A water dilutable antimicrobial composition This invention relates to a water dilutable antimicrobial composition which may be used in particular as a disinfectant for disinfecting industrial plants or installations. The preferred field of application of the composition according to the invention is the disinfection of plant for the production, storage and blending of products which are sensitive to microbial contamination. More particularly, the plants or installations to be disinfected are plants or installations of the type used for the manufacture of foods, i.e. for example milk and milk products, non alcoholic beverages and beer. It is known from the prior art that plant used in the manufacture of foods is normally disinfected after cleaning. In the case of relatively large or complicated installations, i.e. installations which are difficult to dismantle, for example those used in milk processing factories and breweries, so called CIP cleaning in place systems are being increasingly used for cleaning and disinfection. In this case, the installations are cleaned and disinfected in their operational, i.e. non dismantled, state by pumping the chemicals in question or spraying them through permanently installed spray heads through all parts of the installation. After cleaning and disinfection, the chemicals are not discarded for reasons of cost, but instead are recovered and stored in so called storage tanks. Between the individual operations, namely alkaline and acidic cleaning, disinfection, the installations are rinsed with water.For automatically and correctly returning the cleaners and disinfectants to their respective storage tanks, for monitoring the concentration and, optionally, for restrengthening purposes, it is necessary to have a system which, by measuring a parameter substantially immune to variation, enables the individual chemicals to be differentiated and their respective concentrations to be determined. The parameter normally used for this purpose is conductivity which, for strongly alkaline and strongly acidic products, is considerably higher than that of water and is roughly proportional to concentration. An obstacle to the use of strongly alkaline cleaners and disinfectants in breweries is the fact that, in the most important regions, the tanksto be disinfectedstill have a high CO2 partial pressure of which the reduction, by pumping out the gas, is both time consuming and expensive.The CO2 as such also has a certain value. In cases where alkaline disinfectants are sprayed in a CO2 containing tank of the type in question, the high solubility of CO2 in alkalis leads to a drastic reduction in the pH value of the liquid and, in some cases, to a reduction in pressure which, in the event of inadequate pressure equalization, even involves the danger of tank collapse. For the reasons explained above, acidic or acid tolerant disinfectants are preferably used, particularly in breweries. Disinfectants of this type include products containing peracetic acid, so called iodophores, i.e. products containing iodine bound in complex form, products based on quaternary ammonium compounds, products based on anionic surfactants and products based on a halogen carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof, for example esters.Within this group, bromoacetic acid in particular plays a dominant role. There are also some commercially available products based on sulfuric acid bromoacetic acid which have been available on the market for some years. Literature on bromoacetic acid as a preservative and biocide includes WallhSuser 1978, Ullmann 1974 and RÃ¶mpp 1972. The suitability for disinfection under acidic condi tions of the anionic surfactants mentioned above is described, for example, in the standard textbooks byBlock 1977 and Wallhauser 1978 . The hitherto known state of the art products are not entirely satisfactory. Thus, products based on peracetic acid, despite their good and comprehensive effect against all groups of microorganisms, are still attended by the disadvantage that they are not sufficiently conductive in themselves. Accordingly, their use in conductivity controlled CIP installations requires the parallel introduction of a mineral acid, such as phosphoric acid for example, to increase the conductivity of the utility solution. Despite their considerable effectiveness, produdts based on iodophores are attended by the disadvantage that, on account of their iodine content, they are corrosive and discolor plastic components. The disadvantage of quaternary ammonium compounds lies in the fact that their effect decreases drastically with increasing acidification, that foaming occurs and that they are difficult to rinse off the surfaces. Anionic surfactants have a limited activity spectrum, i.e. they are hardly effective against yeasts and are not effective at all against spore formers. In addition, they have the disadvantage that, in general, they foam too vigorously. Halogen carboxylic acids, particularly bromoacetic acid, have the disadvantage that they only show adequate effectiveness in conjunction with the highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Their use in conjunction with the less corrosive phosphoric acid leads unfavorably to a drastic reduction in effect, particularly against yeasts. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide an antimicrobial composition which is intended to be both acidic and highly effective, above all against germs specific to brewing, such as yeasts, conductive in itself and, even in standard concentrations, considerably less corrosive than sulfuric acid. According to the invention, this object is achieved by a water dilutable antimicrobial composition which contains an inorganic acid and or organic acid, an acetic acid halogenated in the ct position and an unbranched or branched aliphatic fatty acid. In one preferred embodiment, the antimicrobial composition contains or consists of a mild mineral acid, such as phosphoric acid, a halogen acetic acid, for example bromoacetic acid, one or more aliphatic carboxylic acids of medium chain length, for example n octanoic acid or ndecanoic acid, solubilizing agents for the fatty acids and, optionally, additives, such as complexing agents, dyes, defoamers and surface active compounds. The technical advance afforded by the product according to the invention lies in the fact that it is a highly effective, fast acting antimicrobial composition which corresponds in its low corrosiveness to that of phosphoric acid, which has good intrinsic conductivity and which foams to a very limited extent only. Accordingly, the product according to the invention is far superior to state of the art products, as can be seen from the following comparison Table 1State of the art Advantage of the product according product to the inventionBasis peracetic acid no additional conductive acid, longer shelf life of the llse solution reuseability Basis iodophores less foam, no discoloration of plastic partsBasis quaternary distinctly improved effectiveness ammonium compounds less foam, better rinsability off surfaces,Basis anionic improved effectiveness, less foam surfactantsBasis halogen acetic distinctly improved effectiveness acid and phosphoric acidBasis halogen acetic distinctly improved effectiveness, acid and sulfuric less corrosiveness. acid One preferred embodiment of the product according to the invention consists of the four components described in the following Component 1 Phosphoric acid or another, only slightly corrosive acid to establish the low pH value required in the use solution 1.8 2.5 phosphoric acid concentrations of from 20 to 70 in the concentrated, antimicrobial preparation are recommended, depending on the required dilution.It is important that the pH value of the use solution should be below 2.5 and that conductivity should be high enough to differ clearly from that of the particular industrial water used at higher levels.Component 2 Halogen acetic acid corresponding to the following formulaEMI6.1 X Cl,Br,IThe described compounds, particularly a bromoacetic acid, show pronounced microbicidal activity and are the primary source of the disinfecting properties of the product according to the invention. Their concentration in the concentrate should be selected in such a way that at least 150 ppm are present in the aqueous use solution.Component 3 Aliphatic carboxylic acids corresponding to the following general formulaEMI6.2 in which n preferably has a value of from 4 to 8, so that all intermediate stages from n octanoic acid or iso octanoic acid to n dodecanoic acid or iso dodecanoic acid are suitable foi use. Mixtures of all these acids may also be used. They should be present in the product according to the invention in concentrations which, after dilution, give a total concentration of the fatty acids mentioned in the use solution of at least 5 ppm.Component 4 The product according to the invention preferably contains one or more solubilizing agents of which the function is to dissolve the fatty acid mentioned under Component 3 both in the concentrated product and also in the use solution.By contrast, the microbicidal effect of the solubilizers as such is of secondary importance. Suitable solubilizers are any compounds from the dass of anionic surfactants, for example alkylaryl sulfonates, cumene sulfonates, derivatives of diphenyl ether disulfonate, a olefin sulfonates, primary alkane sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates and alkylpolyglycol ether carboxylic acids. In another preferred embodiment, the product according to the invention contains additional active ingredients and auxiliaries, particularly defoamers and or complexing agents and or dyes and or surface active compounds. Embodiments of the product according to the invention are described by way of example in the following In the concentrate of the product according to the invention, the concentrations of the individual components preferably remain within the following limits Phosphoric acid 20 70 a halogen carboxylic acid 3 10 n or iso carboxylic acid, chain length 8 12 0.1 10 Additives, such as defoamers, dyes, complexing agents, surface active compounds 0 5 Water 4 75 The product according to the invention should preferably be diluted in such a way as to give the following effective concentrations of the active ingredients in the use solution Phosphoric acid approx.2500 ppm a halogen carboxylic acid approx.150 300 ppm n or iso carboxylic acid, chain length 8 12 approx. 5 20 ppmSolubilizer approx. 50 200 ppmAdditives approx. 0 150 ppm Table 2 below shows the composition of four formulations exemplifying the product according to the invention and also the composition of four comparison formulations.

It was surprisingly found that the various synergistic combinations of fatty acids and a bromoacetic acid and also solubilizers which are described in Examples 1 to 4 according to the invention kill off at least 100 times as many yeasts as the respective individual components. Even the combination of bromoacetic acid sulfuric acid comparison formulation 4 which, hitherto, has been considered to be extremely effective and of which the principle disadvantage is in any case its high corrosiveness, shows comparatively unsatisfactory activity against yeast, even with twice the concentration of bromoacetic acid as in the product according to the invention. Accordingly, the invention represents a surprisingly effective synergistic combination of individual microbicidally active substances which are distinguished from equal concentrations of the individual components by a superior destructive effect on yeasts and bacteria. The invention also relates to the use of the antimicrobial composition according to the invention in aqueous solution as a combined acidic cleaner and disinfectant. In addition, the invention relates in a preferred embodiment to a use of the composition in a use solution which is characterized in that, after alkaline and or acidic cleaning and rinsing with water, the aqueous antimicrobial solution is pump circulated or sprayed in the installation to be disinfected either manually or in an automatic system, the solution being used at temperatures of from 0 to 750C and the circulation or spraying times amounting to between 5 and 30 minutes, and in that, after disinfection, the installation is rinsed with water of drinking quality.
