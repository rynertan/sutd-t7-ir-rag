## Description
Of all road surface conditions on which automobiles run, a frozen road surface is the most slippery and dangerous. In a cold district where automobiles are often obliged to run on the frozen road surface, tires with their tread with studs or chains are widely used. Even in a cold district, however, roads are not always bound with ice in winter in fact, their surface rather remains unfrozen in most part of the winter season. Yet, with the development of automobile traffic today, automobiles have come to be operated frequently with their tires remaining with spikes or chains, also on unfrozen roads, and this has given rise to such social problems that the studs and chains would scratch the road surface and the dust generated thereby would induce environmental pollution, and that an enormous cost would be taken for the repair of the damaged road. As a countermeasure to these problems, there has been a demand for the development of a tire that will require no studs or chains in the driving of automobiles safely even on the frozen road surface. One of the conditions for realizing such a tire is to develop a rubber material capable of providing its tread with sufficient frictional resistance against the frozen road surface. In providing a tire with an increased frictional resistance against the frozen road surface, it has heretofore been thought important for the tread to be composed of a rubber material which remains soft even at low temperatures. In general, the larger the contact area where two objects are rubbing against each other, the greater the frictional resistance. A soft rubber material, when sliding on the road surface, is deformable in good conformity with very small unevennesses of the road surface, so that it will have a large effective contact area and a high frictional resistance on the road surface. Of course, an automobile with tires having a high frictional resistance is advantageous especially when driving on the frozen road surface. From this viewpoint, the tread for the so called snow tire for use in a cold district in winter has been made of natural rubber or polybutadiene rubber which is difficultly stiffened even at low temperatures. Moreover, aromatic process oils have widely been used as a softener, and in some cases process oils having a relatively low aromatic content have been used for the purpose of increasing the frictional resistance against the frozen road surface. The snow tires with their tread made of such rubber material as mentioned above are being used as tires for the frozen road surface, with their frictional resistance increased by the application of studs or chains. Such being the current situation, there has been a demand for a rubber material for the tread having a higher frictional resistance against the frozen road surface than that of the conventional rubber material for the tread, so that it will be made possible for an automobile to run safely, without applying studs or chains to its tires, on the frozen road surface. The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire with a two layer tread structure composed of a cap tread and a base tread, wherein said cap tread comprises natural rubber and or styrene butadiene copolymer rubber, and further containing carbon black and a softener, and wherein the base tread comprises natural rubber and or polyisoprene rubber, polybutadiene rubber and or styrene butadiene copolymer rubber, and further containing sulphur, said base tread having a volume fraction of 0.1 to 0.5 against the entire tread part. A tread of a cap base construction to allow a reduction in rolling resistance to effect an energy saving is known from the GB A 2 058 687, which corresponds to the preamble of claim 1. Besides a high reinforcing carbon black the outer rubber cap composition may include butadiene styrene rubber together with polybutadiene and or cis 1,4 polyisoprene, and the base composition may comprise besides a semi reinforcing carbon black butadiene styrene rubber, natural rubber and polybutadiene. It is an object of this invention to provide a pneumatic tire with a two layer tread structure which is superior in drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface and capable of retaining the superior movement performance for a long period, more particularly, the cap tread which is to be in contact with the ground having an outstandingly improved frictional resistance on the snow covered or frozen road surface and the base tread playing the role of allowing the cap tread to retain its superior characteristics for a long time, and the tire manufactured according to this invention can be used advantageously for an automobile tire in winter. The tire according to this invention is a pnmeumatic tire with its tread part composed of a cap tread and a base tread, wherein said cap tread comprises natural rubber and or styrene butadiene copoloymer rubber, and further containing carbon black and a softener, and wherein the base tread comprises natural rubber and or polyisoprene rubber, polybutadiene rubber and or styrene butadiene copolymer rubber, and further containing sulphur, said base tread having a volume fraction of 0.1 to 0.5 against the entire tread part, characterized in that Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a sectional view of the pneumatic tire of this invention. Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relation between the solubility parameter of the mixed softener used for the rubber material Composition Examples 1 to 10 for the cap tread and the skid resistance on the frozen road surface. Reference numerals in Fig. 1 show Cap tread 1, Base tread 2, Side wall 3, Braker 4, Carcass 5 and Inner liner 6. The pneumatic tire of this invention has a tread part of a two layer structure composed of a cap tread 1 and a base tread 2 as shown in Fig. 1, where 3 is a side wall, 4 a breaker, 5 a carcass, and 6 an inner liner. The rubber component, 100 pts. wt. in total, used for the cap tread of the tire of this invention comprises 50 to 70 pts. wt. of natural rubber NR and or polyisoprene rubber IR , at most 50 pts. wt. of polybutadiene rubber BR containing at most 20 of 1,2 bonding units and at most 50 pts. wt. of styrene butadiene coploymer rubber SBR containing at most 30 wt. of bonded styrene. In order to obtain an increased drivability on the snow studs or frozen road surface, the content of NR and or IR must be at least 50 pts. wt if its content is less than 50 pts wt., it will be difficult to sufficiently improve the drivability on the snow studs or frozen road surface. The content of 1,2 bonding units in BR should be at most 20 if its content exceeds 20 , it will be difficult to elevate the drivability to a high level as required on the snow covered or frozen road surface. BR is used for improving the drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface, and its effect is increased as the temperature is lowered. However, if its content is too high, it would not only bring about an adverse effect when the temperature is in the vicinity of the melting point of ice, but also decrease the drivability on the wet road surface greatly, and therefore its content must not exceed 50 pts. wt. SBR is used, if necessary, for the purpose of improving the drivability on the wet road surface. With the increase in the bonded styrene in SBR, the drivability is increased on the wet road surface but is decreased on the snow covered or frozen road surface. Thus, in order to confine the drop in the drivability within an allowable range, the content of the bonded styrene in SBR must be limited to at most 30 wt and, for the same reason, the SBR content be limited to at most 50 pts. wt. The carbon black to be incorporated in the cap tread of the tire of this invention may be any one that can be used for conventional tire tread material, and its kind need not particularly be limited. The amount of carbon black used for the cap tread of this invention should be 50 to 100 pts. wt. per 100 pts. wt. of the total rubber components. Its amount outside this range is undesirable if its content is less than 50 pts. wt., the drivability on the wet road surface will be lower than the allowable range, and if its content exceeds 100 pts. wt., there will occur too much heat build up. The drivability of a tire depends on the frictional resistance of its tread material. The detailed investigation by the present inventors has revealed that besides the above mentioned rubber components, the selection of a softener and the method of its application are important as the major factors in determining the frictional resistance of rubber material against the snow covered or frozen road surface. The softener used for the cap tread of this invention is a member or a mixture of two or more members selected from among process oil obtained by further distilling and extracting heavy residual crude oil obtained in the refining of crude oil, vegetable oils or their derivatives, and synthetic softeners of ester series, epoxy series, phosphate ester series and ether series, and the solubility parameter SP of the softener as a whole should be in a range of from 8.0 to 9.0. If the softener is specified by its molecular structure, its SP value can be determined according to Small s method P. A. Small, J. Appl. Chem., In the above equation, p is the specific gravity of the process oil, and C Overall SP value of a mixed softener In the above equation, ₁, ₂, ₃ ,are the volume fractions of the softeners 1, 2, 3 , respectively. The frictional resistance against the snow covered or frozen road surface depends greatly on the overall SP value obtained as above of all the softeners contained in the rubber material rather than on the chemical structure of the softener With the decrease in the overall SP value of the softener, the frictional resistance against the frozen road surface tends to increase. This tendency is remarkable especially when the overall SP value is 9.0 or lower. When the overall SP value exceeds 9.0, the frictional resistance against the snow clad or frozen road surface will be on a low level, showing very little change with the change in SP value. In order to elevate the drivability of a tire on the snow covered or frozen road surface, therefore, the overall SP value of the softener used must be at most 9.0. On the other hand, if the softener has a too small SP value, it will have a decreased compatibility with the rubber component and is liable to bleed, and therefore its SP value must be controlled to 8.0 at the lowest. Furthermore, if the softener has a too high viscosity, the frictional resistance against the snow covered or frozen road surface tends to decrease, and therefore it is desirable that the viscosity of each softener used for the cap tread of the tire of this invention is at most 100 cP at 20 C. The softener can be incorporated easily in the rubber component if the process oil as its ingredient is previously incorporated as a extender oil in the rubber component in the process of preparing the raw polymer. The amount of the softener used should be chosen in such a range that its effect can be exhibited to the full. The appropriate range of its use depends on the amount of carbon black used. The total amount of the softener used for the cap tread of the tire of this invention, y pts. wt. , must be in a range satisfying the following inequality, where x is the amount of carbon black, in pts. wt. As described above, the tire according to this invention is provided with a cap tread containing a relatively large amount of a specified softener for the purpose of increasing its drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface. However, the tire with such a cap tread has high build up and is liable to deterioration, and yet the softener is apt to migrate from the cap tread to inner material layers, so that it is difficult for the tire to retain its superior drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface for a long period. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is effective to couple the above mentioned cap tread with a base tread having a specified compostion. The base tread for the tire of this invention is made of a rubber component comprising 60 to 70 pts. wt. of NR and or IR, at most 40 pts. wt of BR containing at most 20 of 1,2 bonding units and at most 40 pts. wt. of SBR containing at most 30 wt of bonded styrene. On driving with this tire, its rubber material is heated and its temperature rises. The greater the temperature rise due to the heat generated in the tread part, the more the rubber material in the cap tread is liable to be stiffened by oxidation, and the more the softener is liable to be evaporated or migrate to other constituent materials, so that the cap tread is lowered in its drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface. Therefore, it is important to minimize the heat generation in the tread part. For this purpose, it is effective to use a base tread made of rubber material with reduced heat generation, such as NR and BR. However, when the tread part is damaged by external scratches such as cuts, a tread separation may be induced if the base tread has no sufficient strength. To prevent this, it is desirable for the base tread to be composed of NR having a high strength in an amount of 60 pts. wt. or more and BR having a low strength in an amount of 40 pts. wt. or less. Furthermore, to improve the roll processability in tire production, SBR containing at most 30 wt of bonded styrene should be used in an amount of at most 40 pts. wt. The bonded styrene content exceeding 30 wt and SBR in an amount exceeding 40 pts. wt. are both undesirable, because a tire is thereby excessively heated while driving. The base tread for the tire of this invention is made of rubber material comprising 100 pts. wt. of the above mentioned rubber component incorporated with 2.6 to 3.6 pts. wt. of sulfur as a vulcanizer The rubber material containing less than 2.6 pts. wt. of sulfur as the vulcanizer cannot exhibit an enough effect of inhibiting the lowering of the drivability in the driving on the snow covered or frozen road surface on the other hand, if the sulfur content exceeds 3.6 pts. wt., the base tread is unfavorably decreased in strength. The tire according to this invention has such a tread structure that the base tread is arranged all over the braker side of the cap tread, and the base tread has a volume fraction of 0.1 to 0.5 against the entire tread part. The volume fraction of the base tread of less than 0.1 causes large heat generation and is therefore undesirable. On the other hand, its volume fraction exceeding 0.5 is also undesirable, because it becomes difficult to provide the tread pattern having grooves of a sufficient depth which is important for the drivability on the snow covered road surface. The effects of this invention will now be explained by experimental examples, examples and comparative examples In Tables 3 and 4, the amounts of ingredients are shown by pts. wt. The ingredients of the rubber material used for the cap tread are shown in Table 1, and the softeners used and their properties in Table 2. Rubber compositions for a cap tread were prepared according to the conventional method, by incorporating the rubber component containing carbon black and softeners in amounts and kinds shown in Table 3 with the ingredients shown in Table 1, and were vulcanized at 160 C for 15 minutes. Samples obtained thereby were tested for skid resistance on the frozen road surface at a surface temperature of 8 C, using a British Portable Skid Tester. Measurements were made in accordance with ASTM E 303. The sample was set to a temperature of 20 C in consideration of heat generated in the tire while driving. The calculated values of the overall SP of all the softeners contained in the rubber material and the observed values of skid resistance are shown by indices, assuming the value for Composition Example 1 as 100, in Table 3. The greater the skid resistance, the higher the frictional resistance, so that a cap tread material having more excellent movement drivability can be obtained. Fig. 2 is a diagram in which the skid resistance index observed on the frozen road surface in Table 3 is plotted against the overall SP value of all the softeners contained in the rubber material, wherein the numeral on each dot shows Composition Example No. in Table 3. It is evident that the drivability skid resistance of the rubber material of a cap tread on the frozen road surface depends greatly on the overall SP value of all the softeners contained in the material, regardless of process oils and synthetic softeners used. With the decrease in the SP value of the softener, the drivability of the rubber material on the frozen road surface is improved. In the region where the SP value exceeds 9.0, however, the drivability is improved very little. To realize a marked improvement in the drivability on the frozen road surface, therefore, the overall SP value of all the In some cases, as in Composition Example 2, the drivability on the frozen road surface may be improved very little even when the SP value is lower than 9.0. This is because the softener 2 has an out standingly high viscosity Table 2 . It is desirable that the viscosity of the softener be 100 cP or lower at 20 C. Rubber materials were prepared by incorporating rubber component containing carbon black in amounts of 55 and 80 pts. wt. with softeners in varied amounts. The samples obtained thereby were investigated for the influence of the softener content on the skid resistance on the frozen road surface. The skid resistance indices of the rubber materials on the frozen road surface are shown in Table 4 carbon black content of 55 pts. wt. and Table 5 carbon black content of 80 pts. wt. . The values of skid resistance on the frozen road surface shown in Tables 4 and 5 are represented by their indices, assuming the values for Composition Examples 11 and 16, respectively, as 100. The methods employed herein for the preparation of rubber materials, vulcanization, and measurement of skid resistance were the same as in Experimental Example 1. When the carbon black content is fixed and the softener content increased, the movement performance skid resistance on the frozen road surface tends to be improved, whereas the improvement behavior is rather complicated as seen evidently in Tables 4 and 5 The effect of an increase in the softener content is remarkable only when its content is within a certain range, while such a positive effect is not or scarcely recognized in other cases. The amount of the softener contained in the rubber material for the cap tread of the tire of this invention is in a range of from more than 16.5 pts. wt. to less than 30.5 pts. wt. in case the carbon black content is 55 pts. wt., or in a range from more than 44 pts. wt. to less than 58 pts. wt. in case the carbon black content is 80 pts. wt., and it is evident from Table 4 and 5 that the effect of the softener on the improvement of the drivability on the frozen road surface is very great as far as the carbon black content is within these ranges. 7 Nippol BR 1220, a product of Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd. Steel radial tires 165 SR 13 provided with a cap tread made of the rubber materials of Composition Examples 1 and 9 were compared for drivability on the frozen road surface. The sample tires had a tread part composed of a cap tread and a base tread in a two layer structure wherein the base tread had a volume fraction of 0.2 against the entire tread part. The base tread was made of a rubber material comprising 70 pts. wt. of NR RSS 3 , 30 pts. wt. of SBR Tufdene 1000R, a product of Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. bonded styrene content of 18 wt. , 3 pts wt. of zinc oxide, 1 pt. wt. of stearic acid, 50 pts. wt. of carbon black ASTM designation N 550 , 5 pts. wt. of an aromatic process oil, 1.2 pts wt. of a vulcanisation accelerator N oxydiethylene benzothiazyl 2 sulfenamide and 2.2 or 3.0 pts. wt. of sulfur. The drivability on the frozen road surface was tested with new tires and used ones which had been driven 5,000 km on paved roads, by observing their braking distance starting with an initial speed of 30 km hr on the frozen road surface. The results are shown in Table 6. The braking performance on the frozen road surface was represented by the index assuming the initial braking distance for tire A Comparative Example as 100. The greater the index, the higher the braking performance. Tire A Comparative Example 1 was provided with a cap tread incorporated with 70 pts. wt. of carbon black and 41.25 pts. wt. of an aromatic process oil having an SP value of 9.70 as a softener in a relatively greater amount and a base tread containing 2.2 pts. wt. of sulfur. Tire B Comparative Example 2 had the same specification as tire A, except that the softener used was a mixed softener having an SP value of 8.54. Tire B, being provided with a cap tread containing a softener with a decreased SP value, was superior to tire A in drivability on the frozen road surface. While travelling, however, the difference in drivability between tires A and B on the frozen road surface became small. The cap tread containing a softener with a smaller SP value was effective in increasing the movement performance of the tire on the frozen road surface, whereas the tire had its drivability decreased while being used, that is, its superiority in drivability was diminished while it was used. Tire C Example 1 was made of the same cap tread material as tire B, and its base tread material had an increased sulfur content of 3.0 pts. wt. As its base tread material had an increased sulfur content. not only tire C could exhibit a drivability as excellent as tire B while it was new, but also its performance was very little decreased by its use. Thus, the tire of this invention has proved to be a tire having a high reliability and capable of retaining its excellent drivability on the frozen road surface for a long period. The constitution of this invention and its effects have now been described by the embodiments of the method for improving the cap tread in movement performance on the snow covered or frozen road surface by adopting a rubber composition effecting an excellent drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface and the method for enabling the tire with such an improved can tread to retain its excellent drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface, as shown in Experimental Examples 1 and 2, Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2. The above embodiments have made clear that the pneumatic tire of this invention, wherein the cap tread is improved in drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface by the combined use of rubber conponent effecting an excellent drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface, softener characteristics which have heretofore been neglected, and the quantities of their application, and wherein the cap tread thus improved is coupled with a base tread having a specified rubber composition and a specified sulfur content, is far more improved, than with the conventional tire, in drivability on the snow covered or frozen road surface and yet capable of retaining its excellent performance for a long period
