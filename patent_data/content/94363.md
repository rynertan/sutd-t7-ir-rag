# Particulate oil absorbing composition and process of using the same to absorb oil.

## Abstract
A process for absorbing oil and a particulate oil absorbing composition are provided, which composition in dust form displays a low explosion hazard and a low flammability, but which after absorption of oil is flammable and entirely con sumed when burned, the particles comprising as the major component at least50 by weight hydrophobic cellulose pulp fibers blended with at least 30 up to 50 of an inorganic cellulose paper pulp filler.
