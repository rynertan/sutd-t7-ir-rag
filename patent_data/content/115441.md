# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR FABRICATING TUBULAR STRUCTURES

## Abstract
A hollow tubular structure 14 having edges 24 , 24 held in close proximity by residual compressive forces in the material forming the tubular structure is formed by first drawing a metal or metal alloy strip 12 through a first die 18 and forming an open tube section 14 and then drawing the open tube section 14 through a second die 20 to bring the edges 24 , 24 into compression one against the other with sufficient force that upon exiting from the die 20 the edges remain in contact to form a closed seam which can be subsequently sealed 28 .
