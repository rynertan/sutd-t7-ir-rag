The device 20 has a polymeric liner 22 that is bonded to the inside of the pipe, the liner being driven outwards into contact with the pipe on activation of a delivery arrangement 26 by heating the pipe from outside. The delivery arrange ment 26 may be of a shape memory metal or of a high modulus engineering plastics material. The bonding material 24 is applied progressively to the inside of the pipe, thereby to preclude entrapment of air between the liner 22 and the inside of the pipe.

## Description
DESCRIPTIONDEVICE FOR AND METHOD OF INTERNAL PIPELINE PROTECTIONAs a result of secondary recovery requirements in oil fields, hot, often saline and corrosive water containing a variety of impurities is pumped at high pressures into the ground to force the oil out. Although the pipes used in this process usually have interior protective linings of plastics material, the areas where the pipe sections have been welded together do not have such a lining and consequently are subject to very high corrosive rates.It is an object of the invention to provide a method of and apparatus for preventing, or at least reducing corrosion in pipes, and particularly, though not exclusively, in weld areas thereof, which may be irregular in surface condition.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an internal pipe protection device comprising tubular delivery means arranged to expand transversely upon application of heat tubular liner means outside and in contact with the delivery means, the liner means being corrosion resistant and deformable upon application of heat and bonding means outside and in contact with the liner means to bond the line means to the inside surface of a pipe, the bonding means being flowable and activatable by application of heat, the delivery means expanding transversely upon application of heat, deforming the liner means and causing the bonding means to flow progressively along the outer surface of the liner means between the liner means and the inside of a pipe. The present invention thus provides a device which may be placed in general position inside the pipe prior to the joining of two pipe sections and which, when located directly beneath the welded and internally exposed joint after the joint has been welded, is expanded by application of external heat so as to apply a corrosion resistant liner means and heat activated bonding means to the inside of the pipe joint. The structure and configuration of the delivery means applies the liner means and the flowable bonding means progressively into intimate contact with the inside of the pipe wall thereby to prevent the formation of voids in said bonding means.The delivery means may be formed from shape memory metal, which may be arranged to expand radially by application of the heat and thus serve as a driver for the liner means.In such embodiments, metal is advantageously coated with a corrosion resistant material. Alternatively, the delivery means may be formed from a high modulus engineering plastics material that is retained in a transversely, usually radially, compressed condition by the liner means until the liner means softens and deforms upon application of heat.Aside from the potential severe corrosion problems associated with any void areas, a major problem is encountered when a protectively lined pipe is pressurised and then later de pressurised. Over time, any void in a pressurised pipe may become pressurised by the components in fluid in the pipe.When the pressure in the pipe is rapidly reduced the void can in essence explode, thereby damaging the integrity of the corrosion resistant liner. The configuration and articulation of the delivery means of the device inherently causes a pumping wave of the bonding means, thereby bonding a chemically resistant liner means to the joint interior surface in a manner free of voids.The device may be actuated from outside a pipe after the device has been placed in the pipe.Furthermore, the liner means may be applied to a roughened or irregular inside surface of a pipe to protect that area and compensate for its surface condition.Advantageously, the bonding means comprises adhesive and a carrier therefor, so that flow of the adhesive can be controlled thereby to avoid a starved bondline. The carrier may comprise a cloth like matrix, for example a fibreglass cloth, and the adhesive may be impregnated therein.In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of providing corrosion protection for the inside of a pipe comprising the steps of locating a heat activatable pipe protection device within a section of the pipe to be protected, the device comprising transversely expandable delivery means, heat deformable corrosion resistant liner means outside and in contact with the delivery means, and a heat activatable bonding means outside and in contact with the liner means and heating the outside of the pipe along said section such that the bonding means is forced transversely outwardly progressively into contact with the inside of the pipe, the bonding means flowing progressively between the liner means and the inside of the pipe to form a bond therebetween.The heating may be effected generally uniformly or progressively alone thP section of tho ninP to produce the progressive flow of the bonding means.Several embodiments of an internal pipe protection device, and methods of providing internal pipe protection, each in accordance with the present invention, will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates in perspective view one embodiment of the device before installation Figure 2 illustrates in perspective view the device of Figure 1 after it has been heated Figure 3 illustrates in full section view the device of Figure 1 placed within pipes to be protected, before activation of the device Figure 4 is a full cross sectional view as in Figure 3 , during installation Figure 5 is a full cross sectional view of the device in Figures 3 and 4 after installation has been completed Figure 6 is a planar view of a portion of a delivery means of the device of Figure 1 in its compressed, or non expanded, condition Figure 7 is a planar view of a portion of an alternative embodiment of the delivery means of Figure 6 in its compressed, or non expanded, condition Figure 8 is a planar view of the delivery means of Figure 6 in its recovered, or expanded, condition Figure 9 is a partial cross sectional view of the weld area of Figure 4, illustrating a wave of bonding material being generated by the delivery means Figure 10 is a partial cross sectional view similar to Figure 9 illustrating further progress of the bonding material Figures 11 to 14 are schematic cross sectional views of further alternative embodiments of delivery means suitable for use in the device of Figure 3 and Figures 15 to 17 illustrate the use of programmed heating on the device shown in Figure 14. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates generally at 20 an internal pipe protection device. The device 20 comprises a liner 22, bonding material 24 and a delivery or driver arrangement 26. The delivery arrangement 26 is a radially compressed, open, cage like tubular member of memory metal which expands upon heating to force the liner 22 and bonding material 24 radially outwardly, as can be more clearly seen in Figure 2. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the device 20 before and after expansion without regard to alterations in the surface of the bonding material 24 that would occur due to the internal configuration of a pipe in which the device 20 would be inserted. It is important to note in Figure 1 that the device is frusto conical in overall shape before heating and generally cylindrical in shape, as illustrated in Figure 2, after heating.A large amount of the bonding material 24 may be placed at the large end of the device as noted at 28, and another large amount of the material may be placed approximately midway along the length of the device as noted at 30. The additional amount of material at 30 is useful when the device is placed directly under a welded pipe joint which inherently has surface irregularities, as will be discussed later.It can also be seen in Figures 1 and 2 that the delivery arrangement 26 may extend axially beyond the liner and the bonding material at the small end of the device The reason for this extension is to prevent the liner 22, which envelopes the delivery arrangement 26, from growing over the edge of the delivery arrangement as the device expands, since such growth would subject the liner to splitting forces and could potentially obstruct flow through the installed internal pipe protection device 20. This problem will become more apparent after detailed discussion of the expansion of the internal pipe protection device.Figure 3 illustrates in cross sectional view the device 20 held by a positioning arrangement 32 directly under a girth weld 34 which joins pipe 36 to pipe 38. A back up ring 40 of T shaped cross section has been used in the welding of pipe 36 to pipe 38 to prevent or at least reduce splattering of contamination from the weld 34 into the inside of the pipes. The device 20 is moved to the vicinity of the weld area, after the intense heat associated with welding has dissipated, by the positioning arrangement 32. The positioning arrangement 32, however, is not essential for operation of the device 20 itself. The positioning arrangement 32 is a pair of support discs and an ial member 42 which moves the device 20 from a position remote from the weld area to directly under the weld area en the welding heat has dissipated.The positioning arrangement 32 also acts as a heat shield to shield the device 20 from the heat of welding and as a windscreen to enhance the heating oven formed between the pipes and device 20 when external heat is used to recover the device. A particularly suitable positioning arrangement is disclosed in the present Applicants contemporaneously filed PatentApplication Case No.MPO739, based on USSN 174289, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.The pipes 36 and 38 are lined with corrosion resistant material 44 Figures 3 to 5 . It can also be seen inFigures 3 5 that the delivery arrangement 26 may have an annular detent region 46 which is used to reduce the force exerted by the delivery arrangement 26 on the liner 22 when the delivery arrangement expands towards the back up ring 40.Figure 4 illustrates in partial cross sectional view the device of Figure 3 at an intermediate stage while heat is being applied uniformly to the pipes 36 and 38 from a source outside the pipes 36 and 38. It can be seen at region 48 that the delivery arrangement 26 has expanded radially, forcing the tubular liner 22 towards the inside surface of pipe 36. The liner 22 is a flexible corrosion resistant material preferably made from crosslinked polymeric material, as will be discussed in further detail later, which is deformed by the delivery arrangement 26. The liner 22 is deformable but not flowable when heated.The bonding material 24 becomes flowable when heated and moves by the radial expansion of the frusto conical shape of the delivery arrangement 26 into contact with the inside wall of the pipe 36 and will flow progressively between the liner 22 and the inside pipe wall, again as shown at 48. The delivery arrangement 26, by its radial expansion, essentially pumps the bonding material 24 in a single wave like fashion thereby precluding the entrapment of air. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in Figures 9 and 10. Figure 9 illustrates in greater detail the wave like configuration of the bonding material 24 in region 48 prior to its intimate contact with the back up ring 40. Figure 10 illustrates further movement of the bonding material 24 which has precluded entrapment of air in the vicinity of the back up ring 40. It can be seen that the extra bonding material 30 is used in the vicinity of the back up ring 40 as filler. The extra material 28 as shown in Figure 1 likewise provides an important first body of bonding material 24 at the beginning of the expansion process. Again, Figure 10 illustrates at 50 the void free encapsulation of the weld back up ring 40 or, likewise any similar internal irregularities on the inside surface of the pipe. Figure 5 illustrates the device 20 after heating has been completed and the device 20 has expanded to provide a corrosion resistant area which overlaps corrosion resistant lining material 44 on the pipes 36 and 38. Figures 6 8 illustrate the specific configuration of the preferred embodiment and an alternative embodiment of the delivery arrangement 26. The delivery arrangement 26 comprises a cage like member of memory metal alloy having a configuration or pattern of slots 52 and webs 54 arranged in an interlocking array of lever arms so as to provide amplification of the available recovery motion of the memory metal. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate alternative web and slot configurations in a compressed, i.e., unrecovered condition. figure 8 illustrates the delivery arrangement 26 in an expanded, i.e. recovered condition. The particular patterns ed in Figures 6 and 7 allow the lattice work structure to be compressed or reduced by as much as 25 to 75 in direction Figure 6 . Stated another way, the patterns illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 allow for a memory metal structure to expand some 50 to 300 in direction 56 depending upon slot and web thicknesses. The memory metal configuration of Figure 8 when used in a generally cylindrical configuration, as illustrated in Figure 2, can be deformed into the configuration of Figures 1 and 6 to 1 4 3 4 of its original diameter.A particularly suitable configuration is disclosed in the present Applicants contemporaneously filed Patent Application Case No.MPO742, based on USSN 173948, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The delivery arrangement amplifies the motion available from a memory metal from the 4 9 maximum for solid metal members to values greater than 25 . A significant amount of motion is very desirable to provide clearance over internal pipe surface irregularities and the weld back up ring during installation. To this end, the delivery arrangement preferably comprises an open cage like structure consisting of machined, etched, stamped or otherwise formed slots of various geometries connected by fingers of memory metal which function as bending beams. The multiplicity of beams spaced apart by slot areas provides the means for amplifying the recovery motion. Figure 7 illustrates a section of a deformed delivery arrangement which when recovered, will consist of straight sided slots as illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows a section of a deformed delivery arrangement which when recovered will consist of diamond shaped slots as shown in Figure 8. The amount of recoverable motion available is primarily a function of slot width, beam width, beam length, and the amount of bending strain per beam. These variables can be balanced in various combinations to yield similar or identical performance. Also apparent is that this approach would also greatly amplify motion in a planar direction with flat slotted sheet. Figures 6 8 show that the memory metal delivery arrangement 26 is coated with a protective coating 58. This material 58 may be the same material used to form the liner 22. The protective coating 58 provides corrosion resistance and may facilitate bonding of the liner to the delivery arrangement as will be discussed later. However, delivery arrangement of the invention may be left uncoated so that it can eventually be removed by corrosive forces. Figures 11 14 illustrate alternative configurations of the delivery arrangement. Figure 11 illustrates a delivery arrangement and overall device configuration which is generally barrel shaped. This configuration will likewise expand progressively upon uniform heating to progressively secure a corrosion resistant liner by pumping a wave of a bonding material, but will do so in two substantially opposite directions rather than in one direction. Figure 12 illustrates a second alternative embodiment of the delivery arrangement which comprises opposed frusto conical sections which will likewise move a wave of bonding material in two directions. Figure 13 illustrates a third alternative embodiment of the delivery arrangement which is generally bell shaped having a gradually sloped contour which will distribute the bonding material substantially in the manner of the device illustrated in Figures 1 5. Figure 14 illustrates an initially generally cylindrical fourth alternative embodiment of the delivery arrangement which can be altered in shape into embodiments shown inFigures 1 5, 11, 12 or 13 by a programmed heating.Programmed heating consists of sequentially heating specific zones of the pipe corresponding to specific locations on the device for a specified time. By doing this the device can be recovered progressively as the different zones are heated. This has the effect of forming a conical shape which imparts the pumping action to the bonding material, thus preventing void formation.Figures 15, 16 and 17 illustrate the use of programmed heating with an initially cylindrical part. Of course the heating zones may be sequenced differently to provide products which expand as do the other shapes shown inFigures 11 through 13.Progressive recovery of the device can be achieved in several different ways. The liner could be selectively cross linked along its axial length which is believed to create a varying softening point along its axial length.This would manifest itself during installation of a cylindrical device with uniform heating in a progressive recovery as discussed above. The same effect could be achieved by varying the liner and or bonding material thickness along the axial length of the device. Thicker sections of the liner would retard or delay recovery of the device locally to impact a progressive recovery mode. Varied bonding material thickness would cause the part to contact the pipe wall first where the bonding material is thickest.This would start the pumping wave and cause the bonding material to flow progressively. The preferred delivery means comprises a memory metal, i.e.an alloy which manifests the shape memory effect. Such alloys are well known, and they, and the shape memory effect, are discussed in, e.g., Shape Memory Alloys , Scientific American, v.281, pp 74 82 Nov.1979 . Especially suitable alloys for the delivery means of this invention are those made from a ternary or quaternary alloy of copper, zinc, aluminium and or manganese.It is desirable, though not essential, that the memory metal material used for the delivery means should have an austenite martensite transformation temperature below the lowest in service operating temperature the device will encounter. This is not because the memory metal is required to continuously hold the liner means against the pipe interior, for that is one of the purposes of the bonding means, but rather to ensure that the delivery means should be in the more rigid austenitic state during operation. In this way, the chance of a part of the delivery means being damaged during normal operations, e.g.when a pig mobile cleaning member is sent through the pipe to clean it, is minimised. It is further desirable that the delivery means be bonded to the liner means, as this a provides additional strength and helps prevent buckling of the delivery means prior to installation, and b minimises the tendency of the liner means to split during the expansion of the delivery means. This bonding may be achieved with suitable adhesives. A more convenient method, however, is to coat the driver means with the same material as the liner means, and fuse the coating of the driver means to the liner means at a plurality of points. This coating of the driver means also helps to prevent any metal metal contact when the device is in place.It is within the scope of the instant invention to utilise sprlng e materials other than memory metals as the delivery means. Suitable spring materials capable of large compression and subsequent recoveries could also be used satisfactorily as will become apparent later in the further description of the delivery means and the liner means interaction. In one embodiment, the delivery arrangement comprises a radially compressed, open, cage like tubular member of high modulus engineering plastics material. Such a delivery arrangement is contained radially by the liner. Upon application of heat, the liner softens and allows the delivery arrangement to expand and recover in a spring like manner to force the liner and bonding material radially outwardly towards the inside of the pipe.It will be appreciated that such a plastics material is inherently corrosion resistant, but it may still be advantageous to provide a protective coating, such as the coating 58, for example to facilitate bonding of the liner to the delivery arrangement. The incorporation of high modulus engineering plastics material into the instant invention as a delivery means is desirable from the standpoint that most inorganic materials do not possess the required high yield elongations, 4 that insures necessary clearance, pipe tolerance accommodation, and bonding means flow characteristics for proper functioning of the device. In general, these engineering materials have a combination of properties that allows considerable amplified motion by the specific cage configuration and sufficient force to deform the liner means at its melting point. A yield elongation of approximately 4 at ambient conditions through the melting point of the liner means and a Young s modulus of 2.11x108kg m2 3 x 105 psi at the melting point of the liner means are the requisite properties of the delivery means. However, it is apparent to one skilled in the art that a number of factors such as the thickness and Young s modulus of the liner material and the specific cage configuration employed can cause the requirements to vary somewhat. The engineering plastics can be non reinforced polymers such as poly amide imide copolymers, reinforced thermoplastics such as nylons, polyesters, and poltzatylenes or thermosetting resins. As apparent to those skilled in the art a number of reinforcing materials can be used such as short or continuous fibers of glass, graphite cir alumina Levels of these reinforcing materials are crlly in the range of 20 to 40 by weight.

It should be electrically non conductive, to prevent galvanic action. It should be solid to a temperature above the maximum operating temperature of the pipe, but should be easily deformable below about 2000C by the delivery means to facilitate installation.It should, of course, be resistant to the materials it will encounter in service, such as hot saline water, H2S, hydrocarbons, etc. It should be relatively impermeable to liquids and gases, to reduce pressurisation of any void area between the liner means and the pipe wall. For optimum installation, the material should be easily deformable by the delivery means somewhat below 2000C, as stated above, but the material should be thermally stable to temperatures substantially greater than that, say 2500C for at least about 1 2 hour, so that little or no damage to it will occur if the pipe is overheated. It should be capable of good bonding to the adhesive chosen and also to the memory metal or engineering plastics material or its coating.Although the liner means may be elastomeric or thermoplastic, it is necessary that it should not melt and flow during installation, but merely soften, so that it retains its integrity and forces the bonding means into contact with the pipe wall. This may be achieved by crosslinking the material of the liner means, such as by the use of chemical crosslinking or by irradiation. An especially suitable material is cross linked poly vinylidene fluoride , which polymer has a melting point of about l700C. If a poly vinylidene fluoride sleeve is used as the liner means, the delivery means may also be coated with poly vinylidene fluoride by a known process such as electrostatic powder spraying, followed by fusion and cross linking. The liner means and delivery means may then easily be attached to each other by heat welding. Up to the softening point of a thermoplastic or crosslinked thermoplastic liner means the hoop stress of the delivery means is less than that of the liner means and therefore is constrained by said liner means. At the liner means softening point its strength drops off rapidly with increasing temperature relative to that of the delivery means. Consequently the strength of the liner means becomes lower than the hoop stress exerted by the delivery means.As this happens the liner means is forced to expand against the pipe wall. An elastomeric liner means may be substituted for a thermoplastic or cross linked thermoplastic liner means if it is provided with a suitable thermally activated constraining device to prevent its expansion by creep.Such a thermally activated constraining device might consist of bands of a thermoplastic material functioning as described above. Alternately the bonding means itself might serve as a thermally activated constraining device.The surface of the liner means may be treated to enhance adhesion to the delivery and or bonding means.The material of the bonding means is also subject to certain constraints. First it should be capable of adhesion to the material of the liner means, to the internal coating of the pipe usually an epoxy layer , and to the weld area, i.e. to both clean and dirty steel. Second, at the installation temperature, it should be sufficiently flowable that it will readily be spread along the region covered by the device, leaving no voids. A suitable viscosity range at installation temperature is from about 10 to 105 kg m s 102 to 106 poise . Third, the material should be thermally stable to above the maximum installation temperature, and it is especially desirable that it not produce gases if overheated, since that could induce voids.Fourth, the material should be chemically stable under the pipe operating environment conditions, in particular it must be hydrolytically stable. a ticularly suitable bonding means are disclosed in the present Applicants pending U.S. Patent Application No. 73946, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.Two principal types of adhesive are suitable for use thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets include, for example, epoxies, melamines, urethanes, and phenolic resins.It is desirable that a thermoset should have a cure temperature near the expected installation temperature about 2000C .While a lower temperature would be possible, for improvement of shelf life and avoidance of pre curing before the bonding means contacts the wall during installation, an installation and cure temperature of about 2000C is preferable. However, the thermoset adhesive must be sufficiently fluid before cure so that it will spread adequately. This may be achieved by the material having a softening point of, say 70 1400C. In this way, by the time the driver means expands towards the pipe wall, the bonding means is already sufficiently flowable. Typical thermoplastics include, for example, polyamides, such as the various nylons and polyesters. In this case, the bonding means should have a melting point close to the softening point of the material of the liner means, so that the bonding means will be flowable at the time of the radial expansion.One suitable thermoplastic polyamide is Nylon 11, and the formulation RDP 21 WHTE commercially available from RilsanCorporation of the U.S.A. containing this polyamide has been found to be of particular suitability. Thermoplastic polyamides have advantages over thermosetting epoxy adhesives, generally having substantially unlimited lifetimes at room and elevated temperatures, and also being more convenient to It has been found, however, that the appreciable reduction n viscosity that takes place when the RDP 21 WHTE adhesive melts, in combination with the outwardly directed force of the expanding delivery means, can result in the adhesive being urged out of the ends of the liner means thereby leaving insufficient adhesive to form a satisfactory continuous and durable bondline.To avoid such a starved bondline, a laminate may be formed in which a fibreglass cloth, or other suitable matrix, is impregnated with RDP 21 WHTE adhesive. Upon heating, the expanding delivery means forces the laminate against the inner surface of the pipe, but the cloth prevents the liner means being urged into contact with the pipe and thus prevents the adhesive being squeezed away from the required bond area. A glass cloth thickness of about 10 mils has been found suitable. In addition to restraining the adhesive to the required bond area, the fibreglass cloth also avoids direct contact, usually metal to metal, between the delivery means and the back up weld ring should the liner means be ruptured. Corrosion at such a contact is thereby avoided.The cloth also acts to distribute such forces as lap, peel and cleavage stress, thereby reducing the possibility of failure of the pipe seal. Furthermore, the fibreglass of the laminate acts as a reinforcing member and resists the contracting forces within the adhesive that arise on change of state thereof from the melt to the solid. The tendency of the adhesive to pull away from the pipe coating, and thereby reduce the effectiveness of the seal, is thus reduced.One possibility applicable particularly to thermoplastics is that the liner and bonding means may comprise the same material. This ensures chemical compatibility, and, by selectively crosslinking the liner means region of the material, the liner means can be rendered non flowable while the bonding means remains flowable. In this way, a unitary sleeve comprising both liner and bonding means may be used, which simplifies the device and enhances reliability.
