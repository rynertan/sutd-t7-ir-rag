# Process and apparatus for the lifting and carriage of objects placed on tray like supports.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process and an apparatus for the lifting and carriage of objects placed on tray like supports, in particular for the lifting and carriage of fruits such as apples, oranges or the like, placed on spacing and positioning trays, in order to put said trays into box shaped containers. The process and the apparatus are characterized in that they comprise a suction hood with movable edges which is positioned on top of each tray support and put in depression to generate a sucking effect with the cooperation of the support which closes at the bottom the suction hood itself. The objects placed on the tray, during the introduction of the suction hood on top of the latter, cause a previous movement of the movable edges of the hood as far as to bring them into contact with the sides of the tray support. During suction said support is deformed towards the inside of the suction hood to allow its introduction, together with the movable edges of the hood, into a box shaped container, the size and shape of which are equal to the size and shape of the tray.
