## Description
MEMBRANE STABILIZING COMPOUNDS AND PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS AND METHODS EMPLOYING SUCH COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to new substituted piperidines, methods for their preparation, and pharmaceutical preparations and methods employing such compounds for membrane stabilization in mammals, including man. Membrane stabilizing agents, such a lidocaine and mepivacaine, have been shown to possess good local anesthetic effects. These compounds, however, offer short durations of the local anesthetic activity. It would be desirable to provide local anesthetic agents which have a long duration, especially when used as spinal or topical anesthetics, which have therapeutic effects against cardiac arrhythmic conditions, and which can be administered either parenterally or orally.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found in accordance with the present invention that advantageous membrane stabilizing effects are provided by compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 3 hydroxyethylpropyl and 4 hydroxybutyl and whereinR is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl groupEMI2.1 or a substituted or unsubstituted cyclohexyl groupEMI2.2 in which Rê,R3, R4 and R5 are the same or different and are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl.The membrane stabilizing effect of these compounds make them useful as spinal anesthetics, topical anesthetics, local anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, inhibitors of interneurons and antiepileptic agents. The compounds can be administered, for example1 perorally as well as in parenteral form. The compounds of the invention can thus be employed in effective amounts to provide such activities in pharmaceutical preparations along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in methods of treating mammals, such as man.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As noted above, R1 in the compounds of the invention can be hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl or 2 hydroxyethyl. R can beEMI3.1 wherein R2, R3, R4 and R5 are the same or different and are each independently selected from hydrogen or methyl.Examples of suitable R groups include 2,6 xylyl, 2,4xylyl, 2,5 xylyl, phenyl, 2 methylphenyl, and 2,6 dimethylcyclohexyl. As is evident from the formulas. above, the compounds of the invention have an asymmetric center.Thus, they can be resolved into optially active isomers.The present invention includes racemates as well as optically active isomers of the compounds. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by various processes. For example, a compound of the formula II EMI3.2 wherein R1 is as defined above and X is a halogen atom other than fluorine can be reacted with a compound of the formula III III wherein R is as defined above and M is Na or K. M can also be hydrogen provided a sodium or potassium containing base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, etc., is present in the reaction mixture. In another method, a picolylhalogenide of the formula IV EMI4.1 wherein X is as defined above above can be reacted with an alkali metal phenol ate of the formula MO R III wherein M and R is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group as defined above in the presence of a lower alkanol and water to form the compound of the formula V EMI4.2 which can be hydrogenated to give a compound of formula VI EMI4.3 If R1 is to be other than hydrogen, the compound of formula VI can then be alkylated or ethoxylated to provide the desired R1 groups. Also, the compound of formula VI can be further hydrogenated to give a compound of formula I above wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclohexyl group. Also, a compound of formula VII EMI5.1 can be reacted with a compound of formula VIII X R VIII wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclohexyl group, and wherein X is as defined above to form a compound of formula V which is then hydrogenated. If R1 is to be other than H, the resultant compound of formula VI can be alkylated or ethoxylated to provide the desired R1 group. Further, a compound of the formula IX EMI5.2 wherein R1 is as defined above can be reacted with a compound of formula VIII above wherein R and X are as defined above, to form a compound of formula I . In still another method, a compound of formula X EMI6.1 wherein R is as defined above can be ring closed to form a compound of the formula I , wherein R1 is not hydrogen.The reaction is carried out in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid and elevated temperature. In a similar manner, a compound of the formula xI EMI6.2 wherein R1 and R are as defined above can be ring closed in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid and at elevated temperature to provide a compound of formula I . A compound of the formula V above may also be alkylated or ethoxylated and then hydrogenated according to the following reaction scheme EMI7.1 Depending on the process conditions and the starting materials, the end product of these processes can be obtained either as the free base or as the acid addition salt, both of which are included within the scope of the invention. Thus, basic, neutral or mixed salts may be obtained, as well as hemi , mono , sesqui or polyhydrates. The acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention may be transformed in a manner known per se into the free base by using basic agents such as alkali or by ion exchange. On the other hand, the free bases obtained may form salts with organic or inorganic acids.In the prepapration of acid addition salts, preferably such acids are used which form suitable therapeutically acceptable salts. Such acids include hydrohalogen acids sulfuric acid phosphoric acid nitric acid perchloric acid aliphatic, alicylic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxy or sulfonic acids, such as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, pyruvic, phenylacetic, benzoic, p aminobenzoic, anthranilic, p hydroxybenzoic, salicylic, p aminosalicylic, embonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, ethylenesulfonic, halogenbenzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthylsulfonic or sulfanilic acids methionine tryprophane lysine or arginine. These or other salts1 e.g., picrates, of the compounds of the invention may serve as purifying agents of the free bases obtained. Salts of the bases may be formed, separated from solution, and then the free base can be recovered from a new salt solution in a purer state. The starting materials are known or may, if they should be new be obtained according to processes known per se. In clinical use, the compounds of the invention can be administered topically, orally, rectally or by injection. They may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation which contains an active component either as a free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, lactate, acetate, sulfamate, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active component is included in the preparation in an amount effective to provide the desired antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsive, interneuronal inhibiting or anesthetic effect.The carrier may be in the form of a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent, or a capsule. Usually the amount of active compound is between 0.1 and 99 by weight of the preparation, between 0.01 and 20 by weight in preparations for injection and between 2 and 99 by weight in preparation for oral administration. In the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations containing a compound of the present invention in the form of dosage units for oral administration, the compound s selected may be mixed with a solid pulverulent carrier, such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatin, as well as with an antifriction agent such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and polyethylene glycol waxes. The mixture is then pressed into tablets. If coated tablets are desired, the above prepared core may be coated with a concentrated solution of sugar, which may contain gum arabic, gelatin, talc, titanium dioxide or with a lacquer dissolved in volatile organic solvent or mixture of solvents.To this coating, various dyes may be added in order to distinguish among tablets with different active compounds or with different amounts of the active compound present. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared which capsules contain a mixture of the active compound or compounds of the invention and vegetable oil. Hard gelatin capsules may contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid, pulverulent carrier such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, potato starch, corn starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatin. Dosage units for rectal administration may be prepared in the form of suppositories which contain the active substance in a mixture with a neutral fat base, or they may be prepared in the form of gelatin rectal capsules which contain the active substance in a mixture with a vegetable oil or paraffin oil. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be prepared in the form of syrups or suspension, e.g., solutions containing from 0.2 to 20 by weight of the active ingredient and the remainder consisting of sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. If desired, such liquid preparations may contain coloring agents, flavoring agents, saccharin and carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent. Solutions for parenteral administration by injection may be prepared as aqueous solutions of a water soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active compound, preferably in a concentration from 0.01 to 10 by weight. These solutions may also contain stabilizing agents, agents that affect the duration of the therapeutic effect, such a vasoconstrictors e.g., vasopressin or derivatives , dextranes, potassium ions, Na benzoate, agents that affect the weight of the solutions, such as sugars, and or buffering agents and may be manufactured in different dosage units. The precise dosage administered will depend upon the intended application, i.e., as a spinal anesthetic, topical anesthetic, local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, interneuronal inhibitor and or antiepiletic. Typically, as a spinal anesthetic and local anesthetic, the compounds of the invention will be employed as from about .1 to about 10 by weight solutions. The topical anesthetic used in the compounds are from, for example, from about .1 to about 20 by weight of the preparation, e.g., a cream or lotion. For antiarrhythmic, interneuronal inhibitors and anticonvulsive applications, the compound of the invention may be administered by single or repeated parental or oral administration of from about 20 to about 1,000 mg of the compound, with the actual dosage being titrated to the individual.
