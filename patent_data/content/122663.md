# METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING SPEAKER PERFORMANCE

## Abstract
In order to compensate for excursion limitations in a speaker system, a control circuit is provided for dynamically modifying the frequency response of the audio input signal prior to being applied to a power amplifier which drives the speaker. The control circuitry includes a frequency divider for dividing the audio signal into high frequency and low fre quency ranges, dc converters for providing dc control signals as a function of the amplitude of the high frequency and low frequency signals, an equalizer for receiving the audio input signal, and high frequency and low frequency shaper circuits which are controlled as a function of the dc control signals and operates to modify the frequency response of the equalizer. In a bi amplified system, a separate control circuit is used for each speaker in the system in order to independently control the motion of each speaker. The use of the control circuitry of the present invention results in increased bandwidth, reduced distortion and increased maximum output level of the speaker system.
