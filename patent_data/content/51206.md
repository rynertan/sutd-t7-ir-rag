# Vehicle seat having height adjustment, automatic weight adjustment and protected ride zone.

## Abstract
A mounting system for a vehicle seat having an air spring suspension includes a time delay valve means 24,38 which cooperates with a linkage 40,44,46,50 carried by the seat lower base 14 to automatically position the seat upper base at the same vertical mid ride position of the suspension regardless of the weight of the seat occupant. The system also includes an adjustable linkage 48,52,72,78,80,82,84,86,88 which can be activated by the occupant before or after he is seated to reposition the seat upper base to a new mid ride position of the suspension which can be adjusted in height relative to the floor of the vehicle in a range above or below a predetermined mid range position. The system further in cludes a structure for providing a protected ride zone which has substantially the same movement range above and below the mid ride position regardless ofthe occupant s weight or the adjusted position of the height adjustment linkage. When the seat is not being vibrated, the occupant will, regardless of the position of the height adjustment means, always be positioned at the mid ride or center position of the ride zone.
