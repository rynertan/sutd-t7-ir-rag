## Description
Container of Polyethylene Eerephtha Late or Saturated Pol fester Resin The present invention relates to a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin. Polyethylene terephthalate has a wide range of applications as the material of containers such as bottles and the like, because it has excellent physical properties such as gas barrier properties and so forth. A conventional container of the polyethylene terephthalate resin is ordinarily formed by biaxially orienting blow molding a preformed cylindrical piece with a bottom. 1Since the neck section of the container is not biaxially oriented in the blow molding, the resultant container has unstable physical properties and is susceptible to thermal deformation.However, the containers such as bottle shaped containers are required to be very tightly sealed according to the contents to be contained therein. Therefore, the neck section or end of such container is usually sealed or caulked by a crown cap thereon or sealed with a cap placed thereon with interposition of a packing. However, if the neck section is deformed by some external factors such as heat, the aforementioned sealing effect of the sealing means is diminished. The conventional container of the polyethylene terephthalate resin is particularly heat treated such as so called thermal setting at a temperature exceeding the softening point of the polyethylene terephthalate resin so as to improve the thermal resistance thereof, after it is blow molded. In this case, the container body is held by a mold of suitable shape so that it is not collapsed in shape due to the heat. Though the container body is allowed to be subjected to small thermal deformation, the neck section of the container is prohibited to be affected even by a small deformation due to the reasons described above. The polyethylene terephthalate resin has another large feature such as its transparency. It sometimes deteriorates its physical properties and qualities due to the external light according to the properties of the contents to be contained within the container and hence requires to improve the content physical property resistance against the external light. Further, a conventional bottle shaped container of the biaxially oriented saturated polyester resin can be increased in the strength thereof due to the biaxial orientation, can save the quantity of the material due to the reduction in the thickness of the container due to the biaxial orientation, does not ooze out deterimental substance such as solvent or the like with the material, and does not produce toxic gas when it is incinerated after its disposal and is accordingly attracted notice with such advantages. Such bottle shaped containers are formed, due to the convenience of molding, thick at only the neck section and thick at the shoulder, body and bottom sections according to the biaxial orientation.In the biaxial orientation blow molding, thermal deformation temperature is extremely low. When high temperature liquid is, for example, filled in the container so as to perform its heat sterilization, the container is thermally shrinked to cause the impossibility of filling accurately the content.Therefore, it is necessary to be subjected to heat treatment simultaneously with or after the formation of the bottle shaped container so as to enhance the thermsl deformation temperature of the biaxially oriented sections of the container. It is also necessary to carry out the heat treatment due to the reasons that the deterioration in the dimensional accuracy caused by the high temperature is prevented, the occurrence of chatter is prevented, and the capping accuracy is improved by increasing the surface hardness, so as to strengthen thethick neck section not biaxially oriented of the container. An aim of the present invention is to provide a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the aforementioned disadvantages of the conventional container can be eliminated and in which the content physical property resistance against external light is improved. The present invention is accordingly directed to a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, having a neck section at least part of which is crystallised and a body which is coloured transparently or opaquely and is thermoses. The neck section of the container may be rigidly formed with stable physical properties. light from the exterior can be effectively shielded out to improve the content physical property resistance thereof. The present invention may provide a hollow, blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the neck section is not thermally affected or deformed. The present invention may Further provide a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the neck section is not varied in size in high accuracy. The invention may yet further provide a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate.of saturated polyester resin, in which the thick neck section is colored densely as compared with the other sections such as body, shoulder and bottom sections with preferable contrast in external appearance like that another article is assumed to be mounted on the top thereof. The invention may yet further provide a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the thick neck section can be efficiently and effectively heat treated, the material of the neck section can be reduced, and further the heat treated state of the neck section can be evidently in its external appearance with excellently colored outlook. The invention may yet further provide a hollow blow molded container or a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the necessary upper end of the neck section is thickly strengthened and the lower half of the upper end of the neck section is thinly formed to reduce the quantity of the material thereof. The invention may yet further provide a hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the upper part of the neck section is increased in Ã…ai ameter larger than the intermediate part thereof, and the upper half of the upper part thereof is increased in diameter larger than the lower half part of the upper part thereof to secure the exact mounting of acap thereon. The invention may yet further provide a hollow blowmolded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate or saturated polyester resin, in which the upper part of the neck section is crystallized on the surface to secure the exact tightening of the cap, and the crystallized part can be clarified obviously in its external appearance as the crystallized biaxial orientation bottle shaped container due to the different colour of the non crystallized part thereof with excellently coloured outlook so as to enhance the value of the commodity of the container. Two examples of a container made in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is an elevational side view of an entire hollow blow molded container of a preferred embodiment of the present invention and Figure 2 is an elevational side view, partly in axial section, of another preferred embodiment of the container of the invention. Reference is now madetb the drawings, particularly to Fig. 1, which shows a preferred embodiment of the hollow blow molded container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate resin constructed according to the present invention, wherein the like reference numerals designate equal or equivalent components and parts in the following view. In Fig. 1, the reference numeral 1 designates a hollow bottle shaped container of polyethylene terephthalate resin which is formed by biaxially orientation blow molding a preformed piece. when the preformed piece is molded, a predetermined pigment is added to the material therefore so that the container body 1 blow molded is colored in transparency or in opaque. The neck section 2 of the container body 1 is crystallized by a heat treatment under the temperature control. The container body 1 is, colored transparently or opaquely as described above so as to prevent the trasmission of external light into the container body 1 to improve the content physical property resistance of the container and to hence prevent. the deterioration of thÃ« content contained I I in the container body 1. The neck section 2 of the container is crystallized by the heat treatment, because the polyethylene terephthalate resin is physically and rigidly stabilized by the crystallization to hardly thermally deform itself, and the neck section 2 is hardly affected by the heat treatment such as thermal setting step after the container of the polyethylene terephthalate resin is blow molded. When the preformed piece or parison is particularly biaxially blow molded, the neck section 2 is not oriented and susceptible to crystallization and accordingly readily becomes brittle due to the crystallization, but since the neck section is thickened, it is firmly strengthened. It should be understood from the foregoing description that since the container body of the polyethylene terephthalate resin is entirely colored, it can effectively shield light from the exterior to improve the content physical property resistance thereof. It should also be appreciated that since the neck section of the container is crystallized, it is not thermally affected nor deformed, and accordingly it is not apprehended that the neck section is deformed or varied in size due to the high temperature, caused by the thermal step of the entire container or the high temperature of the content liquid such as juice.or milk to be filled within the container when the liquid is sterilized at high temperature.It should alsd be noted that since the neck section of the container is rigidly treated, it can be convenient even when it is caulked with a crown cap thereon and very effective when the dimensional accuracy thereof is maintained. It should also be appreciated that since the neck section of the container is crystallized and thickened, itis densely colored as compared with the other sections such as body, shoulder and bottom sections with preferable contrast in the external appearance like that another article is assumed to be mounted on the top thereof decoratively. It should also be noted that since the container of the polyethylene terephthalate resin constructed according to the present invention is colored transparently or opaquely, it has excellent content physical property resistance, and since the neck section of the container is crystallized, it is rigid and not susceptible to the thermal deformation with excellent properties. Referring now to Fig. 2, which shows another preferred embodiment of the hollow blow molded bottle shaped container of a biaxially oriented saturated polyester resin, the reference numeral 1 designates a bottle shaped container of saturated polyester resin, 3 is a body, 4 is a shoulder, and 2 is a neck section. The neck section 2 of the container 1 is formed much thicker than the body and the like, because the neck section of a preformed parison is held in a mold and thigh pressure air is blown into the parison while longitudinally orienting the parison to biaxially orient the parison into the blowmolded bottle shaped container. The neck section of the parison held by the mold is not oriented, and hence becomes thick neck section of the blow molded bottle shaped container. The upper part 5 of the neck section 2,of the container 1 is so formed as to be thicker and larger in outer diameter than the intermediate section 6 of the neck section 2 and the upper half part 5a of the upper part 5 is formed thicker and larger in outer diameter than the lower half part 5b of the upper part 5. It is preferred to provide a stepped part between the upper half part and the lower half part as well as between the lower half part of the upper part and the intermediate part. It is noted that the thickness of the upper half part of the upper part is thickened in the amount satisfying the strength necessary to a capping step of the neck section, the lower half part is thickenend the amount lower than the lower half part of the upper pat. It is preferred to form reinforcing projecting strip 7 peripherally on the lower outer surface of the neck section of the container. Then, the upper part and hence the upper half part and the lower half part thereof of the neck section of the container is crystallized. The crystallization is performed by heating it higher than a glass transition temperature and gradually cooling it. In order to mainly crystallize the upper part of the neck section of the container, a heat shielding plate is wound on the neck section except the upper part of the container as an example, and the plate is removed after it is heated. The upper part of the neck section of the container is discolored due to the crystallization.When the bottle shaped container is, for example, colorless transparently, the crystallized part becomes white like milk, and when it is colored transparently, the crystallized part becomes opaque of the color diluted from the original color of the container. It should be understood from the foregoing description that since only the upper part of the neck section of the container is thickened and the upper half part of the upper part of the neck section is further thickened than the lower half part of the upper part thereof, the necessary upper end of the neck section of the container is thickly strengthened and the lower half part of the upper end of the neck section is thinly formed to reduce the quantity of the material thereof. It should also be appreciated that since the upper half part of the upper part of the neck section is increased in diameter larger than the lower half part of the upper part of the neck section thereof, the exact mounting of a cap can be secured to the bottle shaped container. It should also be noted that since the upper part of the neck section of the container is crystallized on the surface, the exact tightening of the cap can be secured to the bottle shaped container, and since the crystallized part of the neck section of the container can be clarified obviously in its external appearance as the crystallized biaxial orientation bottle shaped container due to the different color of the non crystalli zed part of the neck section with excellently colored outlook, the value of the commodity of the container can be enhanced.
