# Apparatus for the production of helically wound thermoplastic pipe.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed for the production of double walled helically wound thermplastic pipe. The apparatus includes an endless former 10 of the axially advancing and rotating type for forming a hand of thermoplastic material 24 into a corrugated outer wall 26 . An internal extruding device 28 extends along the core of the former and extrudes a second band 34 of thermoplastic material onto the interior of the outer wall. A cold shoe 36 presses the inner wall against the outer wall to form a smooth inner wall 42 of the double walled pipe. It is also possible to provide for the insertion of a reinforcing profile in the corrugations of the outer wall.
