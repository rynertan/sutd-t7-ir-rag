## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a plastic type multifilament optical fiber comprising, as an island component, 1,000 to 10,000 filaments having a diameter smaller than 500 µ, especially 50 to 300 µ, which are embedded and arranged in a plastic material as a sea component. A multifilament optical fiber comprising quartz type optical filaments having a diameter smaller than 200 µ, which are arranged at a high degree of orientation and having ends thereof bonded to one another by an adhesive, is capable of transmitting an image by light and is widely used as an image scope in the field of medical instruments and as an optical fiber sensor in other industrial fields. This quartz type multifilament optical fiber is formed by gathering quartz type optical filaments independently prepared. This quartz type optical fiber is disadvantageous in that if there is a slight arrangement error in optical filaments, the optical fiber cannot be used as an image transmitting member at all. Accordingly, a very high precision is required for the preparation process and hence, the manufacturing cost is extremely increased. Furthermore, the quartz type optical fiber is more readily broken than a plastic type optical fiber, and even if one filament is damaged during the preparation of the multifilament quartz type optical fiber, the optical fiber cannot be used as an image transmitting member at all. Accordingly, strict control is required for maintenance of the preparation process. Moreover, quartz type optical filaments are readily broken and this means that the quartz type multifilament optical fiber is often rigid. Therefore, when the optical fiber is used as an image scope, a large bending angle cannot be adopted and the visual field that can be inspected becomes narrow. On the other hand, a plastic type optical fiber is advantageous in that it is soft and easy to handle, and various multifilament optical fibers comprising plastic optical filaments have been developed. For example EP 0131058 and U.S. Patent No. 3,556,635 disclose processes in which plastic type multifilament optical fibers are prepared by using a composite spinning nozzle. EP 0131058 describes a process in which selected polymers are extruded from the orifice holes of the spinning nozzle to produce optical filaments which are asssembled to form multilayer optical fibers. The present invention also discloses such a process however unlike that described above, the process advantageously permits the preparation of optical fibers comprising 1000 to 10,000 optical filaments. Furthermore the filaments prepared according to the present invention are particularly uniform in dimension by virtue of the unique shape of the spinning orifices of the composite spinning nozzle. The spinning nozzle used in the process described by U.S. 3,556,635 is shown in Fig. 1 and comprises a core forming orifice plate 11, a sheath forming orifice plate 12 and a sea forming orifice plate 13, which are combined so that spaces 14 and 15 are formed, and pipes 16 and 17 arranged vertically in the respective spaces to introduce the respective components. The multifilament optical fiber prepared according to this process comprises about 100 filaments having a cross sectional structure shown in Fig. 3 of this patent and described in column 5, lines 23 through 34 and also having a diameter of 100 µ, and the matrix occupies about 45 of the total volume. The plastic type multifilament optical fiber can tentatively transmit an image, but since the number of filaments per bundle is as small as about 100 and the matrix content is as high as 45 , the resolving power is smaller than that of the quartz type multifilament optical fiber. Therefore, development of a plastic type multifilament optical fiber having a high optical filament pack density is desired. In addition, the above mentioned known process is defective in that sheath and sea polymers are likely to stay in dead spaces 18 and 19 of the spinneret. Moreover, the pipes 16 and 17 are arranged for introduction of the respective components and the cross section of the plastic type multifilament optical fiber prepared by using this spinneret nozzle tends to have a square, hexagonal or octagonal shape. This is another cause of the insufficient image transmitting property of this multifilament optical fiber. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 54 116417 teaches that if an improved spinneret 20 as shown in Fig. 2 is used, dead spaces for polymers are not formed at all and an improved plastic type multifilament optical fiber can be obtained, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 56 39505 shows a plastic type multifilament optical fiber prepared by using this spinning apparatus. However, the number of optical filaments in the plastic type multifilament type optical fiber prepared according to this process is smaller than 200 and the matrix content is as high as 20 to 30 . Moreover, deviations of the cross sectional shape and fineness are great among the optical filaments as the island component, and therefore a further improvement is required so as to utilize this plastic type multifilament optical fiber as an image transmitting member. The present invention seeks to provide a process in which a plastic type multifilament optical fiber comprising 1,000 to 10,000 islands as optical filaments and having a matrix content lower than 30 , which has a high optical filament pack density and a good image resolving power, is prepared at a high efficiency. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of an islands in the sea multifilament optical fiber using a composite spinning spinneret comprising at least three piled orifice plates including The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a spinning apparatus for use in carrying out the present invention. In this apparatus, a sea component polymer and a core component polymer constituting islands are supplied to melt extruders A, B and C, and molten polymers are separately fed into a spinneret D, and islands comprising a core and a sheath are first formed. Then, the islands are gathered by the polymer constituting the sea and an islands in a sea type fiber comprising gathered core sheath filaments is spun. The molten assembly formed by the spinneret D is cooled and solidified by a quenching device E, and the resulting fiber is taken up at a constant speed by a take up roll G through a guide roll F, whereby a plastic type multifilament optical fiber is obtained. Fig. 4 is a sectional view illustrating an example of the spinneret for use in carrying out the present invention. This spinneret is a composite spinneret for the production of an islands in a sea type multifilament fiber, which comprises four piled orifice plates, that is, an orifice plate 41 for forming cores of optical filaments, a sheath forming orifice plate 42, a sea forming orifice plate 43 and an orifice plate 48 for gathering optical filaments. Even if the sheath forming orifice plate 42 is removed in this spinneret apparatus, the intended plastic type multifilament optical fiber of the present invention can be prepared. However, in order to obtain a multifilament optical fiber providing a sharp image and having a high resolving power, it is preferred that this sheath forming orifice plate 42 be used in combination with other orifice plates. Moreover, a protecting layer forming orifice plate may be arranged between the sea forming orifice plate 43 and the sheath forming orifice plate 42. In Fig. 4, reference numerals 41a, 42a and 43a represent a spinning hole for the core component, a spinning hole for the sheath component and the spinning hole for the sea component, respectively. One of the characteristic features of this spinneret resides in the shape of the spinning hole 43a of the orifice plate arranged just above the lowermost orifice plate, that is, the sea forming orifice plate 43 arranged just above the filament gathering orifice plate 48. The shape is shown in an enlarged view of Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, reference numeral 53 represents a sea forming orifice plate and reference numeral 53a represents a sea component spinning hole. It is indispensable that the sea component spinning hole 53a should have a trumpet shaped opening extending toward the lower face of the sea forming orifice plate 53, as shown in Fig. 5. It is especially preferred that the lower portion of the spinning hole 53a be downwardly expanded. It is preferred that the spinning hole 53a be formed so that the relations of If the above mentioned orifice structure is adopted, the molten polymers flow very smoothly at the joint point of the island component and sea component, and laminar flows of the island component and sea component are substantially maintained in each spinning hole and hence, a high circularity can be given to the section of the island component, with the result that the cross sectional shape of the obtained multifilament optical fiber is much more uniform than in the conventional products, as shown in Fig. 6. If the spinning hole of the sea forming orifice has a trumpet shaped opening extending to the lower end face of the orifice as specified in the present invention, the islands in a sea fiber in the plasticized stats separates from the Sea forming nozzle in a good condition without meandering or eccentricity. Accordingly, occurrence of uneven fineness or insufficient circularity can be effectively prevented and the uniformity of the islands in a sea fiber can be highly improved. If these filaments are gathered by the filament gathering orifice plate, there can be obtained a multifilament optical fiber in which optical filaments are uniform and the content of the matrix component is maintained below 30 , and which has a good resolving power. In the above mentioned spinneret, it is preferred that at the joint point between the sea component flow passage 54 and the island forming nozzle hole 55, a slit shaped opening be formed between a projection 56 formed on the end of the sea component flow passage and the lower face of the orifice plate arranged just above the sea forming orifice plate. In the conventional spinneret as shown in Fig. 1 or 2, pipes are vertically arranged in this joint point and eccentricity, deviation or shaking of molten polymer flows is readily caused by these pipes. In contrast, in the spinneret of the present invention having the above mentioned specific structure, occurrence of this undesirable phenomenon is effectively prevented, and formation of uniform sea island interfaces and reduction of the thickness of the layer of the sea component become possible. If this slit structure is also formed at the joint point of the orifices for forming the core and sheath of the optical filament and at the joint point of the orifices for forming the sheath and the protecting layer, the intended object of the present invention can be attained more efficiently. The preparation of the multifilament optical fiber by using the spinneret apparatus shown in Fig. 4 will now be described. A core forming polymer for formation of islands of the multifilament optical fiber is supplied from a supply opening 45 of a distributing plate 44 and is spun out from many spinning holes 41a formed in the core forming orifice plate 41. A polymer for forming the sheath as the other component of the island is supplied from a supply opening 46 of the distributing plate 44 and uniformly covers the periphery of the core layer flowing from the upper portion through a distributing slit 46b to form a uniform core sheath structure of the island as an optical filament. The sea forming polymer is supplied from the supply opening 47 of the distributing plate 44 through the distributing slit 47b and covers the periphery of the island flowing from above to form an optical filament having an islands in a sea structure, and the filament flows downward very smoothly from the trumpet shaped opening 43a. These filaments are gathered and integrated at the spinning opening 49 of the filament gathering orifice plate to form a multifilament optical fiber according to the present invention. According to the process of the present invention, it is possible to prepare a plastic multifilament optical fiber which comprises at least 1,000 optical filaments having a diameter of 5 to 500 µ and has a matrix content lower than 30 and a good resolving power, though preparation of such a plastic multifilament optical fiber is considered impossible according to the conventional techniques. Furthermore, the cross section of each of the filaments contained in this multifilament optical fiber is substantially equal and the variation of the fineness is very small. As the organic substance to be used for the core of the optical filament as the island in the multifilament optical fiber of the present invention, an amorphous transparent polymer is preferable. For example, a homopolymer of methyl methacrylate and a copolymer of at least 70 by weight of methyl methacrylate with up to 30 by weight of a monomer copolymerizable with methyl methacrylate, such as methyl acrylate or ethyl acrylate, a copolymer of a methacrylic acid ester such as cyclohexyl methacrylate, t butyl methacrylate, norbornyl methacrylate, adamantyl methacrylate, benzyl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate or naphthyl methacrylate with a monomer copolymerizable therewith, a polycarbonate, polystyrene, a styrene methacrylic acid ester copolymer, and deuternation products of these polymers formed by substituting all or parts of hydrogen atoms of these polymers by deuterium atoms, are preferably used. Of course, other transparent polymers, transparent core polymers and transparent blends may be used. As the sheath of the optical filament as the island in the multifilament optical fiber of the present invention, there is ordinarily used a substantially transparent polymer having a refractive index smaller by at least 0.01 than the refractive index of the core polymer. It is preferred that a polymer having a refractive index smaller by 0.01 to 0.15 than that of the core polymer be selected and used as the sheath polymer. The kind of the sheath polymer is not particularly critical and any of known sheath polymers may be used. For example, when a homopolymer or copolymer of methyl methacrylate is used as the core polymer, a polymer obtained by polymerizing an ester of methacrylic acid with a fluorinated alcohol, as disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication Kokai No. 43 8978, No. 56 8321, No. 56 8322 and No. 56 8323 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 53 60243, can be used. When a polycarbonate or polystyrene is used as the core polymer, for example, poly methyl methacrylate can be used. As another example of the sheath polymer, there can be mentioned a vinylidene fluoride type polymer as disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication Kokoku No. 43 8978 or No. 53 42260. Furthermore, a vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene copolymer, a polymer of a methacrylic acid ester other than methyl methacrylate mentioned above and a methylpentene type polymer can be used as the sheath. In the present invention, it is preferred that the sea component be composed of such an organic polymeric substance that the melt flow rate MFR ₂ of the organic polymeric substance is equal to or larger than the melt flow rate MFR ₁ of the core component of the island, so that at the time of melt shaping for forming the islands in a sea structure, the islands are kept as circular as possible while preventing occurrence of the deformation. In order to maintain a high circularity in the islands, it is mainly important that the above relation should be established between the melt flow rate MFR ₁ of the core component and the melt flow rate MFR ₂ of the sea component, and the melt flow rate MFR ₃ of the sheath component is important for maintaining a high light transmitting property. More specifically, it is preferred that the melt flow rate MFR ₃ of the sheath component be intermediate between the melt flow rate MFR ₂ of the sea component and the melt flow rate MFR ₁ of the core component. Organic polymeric substances satisfying such requirements are selected, for example, from polyamides, polyester elastomers, nylon elastomers, polystyrene elastomers, polyolefin elastomers, poly 4 methylpentene 1, polyvinylidene fluoride, ionomers, ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinylidene fluoride copolymers, highly flowable polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, polycarbonate, ABS, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene. The melt flow rate MFR referred to in the present invention can be determined according to JIS Japanese Industrial Standards K 7210 1976, ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials D 1238 82 and ISO International Organization for Standarization 1133. For example, according to JIS K 7210 76, the method A manual cutting method is adopted and the measurement is carried out at a test temperature of 230 C under a test load of 5 Kg. Other conditions are a die length of 8.000 Furthermore, when the measurement is carried out according to ASTM D 1238 82 and ISO 1133, test and measurement conditions specified in these standards are adopted, and measurement devices, tools and procedures are determined within the ranges specified by these standards. The light transmitting gathered fiber has a small light transmission loss and is hence excellent. In order to provide an optimum image transmitting member, it is preferred that the light transmission loss is smaller than 3,000 dB Km, especially smaller than 1,300 dB Km, particularly especially smaller than 500 dB Km. An image transmitting member formed by using the light transmitting gathered fiber transmits an image by visible rays, and it is preferred that the transmission loss in the visible region be within the above mentioned range. It is known that in case of a light transmitting gathered fiber having a transmission loss of 1,300 dB Km, when an image is transmitted along a distance of 1 m, the light quantity is reduced to 74 , and it also is known that in case of a light transmitting gathered fiber having a transmission loss of 500 dB Km, when an image is transmitted along a distance of 1 m, the light quantity is reduced to 89 . An image scope comprising a plastic type optical fiber is often used for transmitting an image along a distance of scores of centimeters to several meters. When a practical distance is considered based on the above mentioned reduction of the light quantity, it is seen that the transmission distance causing 50 reduction of the light quantity is 2.3 m at 1,300 dB Km, 6 m at 500 dB Km and 1 m at 3,000 dB km. Accordingly, it is preferred that the transmission loss be smaller than 3,000 dB Km. The resolving power can be mentioned as a factor having a relation to the capacity of the image transmitting member. There are various methods for determining the resolving power, but when an image is transmitted, the resolving power is most directly determined according to a method in which the devitation between the positions of an original image and a transmitted image is measured. This image is transmitted as a two dimensional plane. Accordingly, when the light transmitting gathered fiber is vertically cut in the longitudinal direction, supposing that the central points of the filament at the position of the i th line in the lateral direction and j th line in the longitudinal direction on both the end faces of the gathered fiber are designated as X i,j and Y i,j , the positional deviation between the original image and the transmitted image is expressed by the following formulae with respect to the lateral direction, and with respect to the longitudinal direction. In the above formulae, m stands for the number of filaments on the j th line in the longitudinal direction and n stands for the number of filaments on the i th line in the lateral direction. As a result of our research, it was found that in order to attain a high resolving power in the light transmitting gathered fiber, it is preferred that the deviation between the central points of the positions of the original image and the transmitted image should satisfy the following requirements and especially, and particularly especially, and The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples that by no means limit the scope of the invention. A light transmitting gathered fiber was prepared by using a spinning apparatus as shown in Fig. 3, to which a spinneret having 3,000 spinning holes, as shown in Fig. 4, was attached. In the spinneret, the downward expansion angle ϑ in the trumpet shaped openings between the lower ends of every two adjacent sea forming polymer extruding holes, where the sea component and island component joined, was 15 , and the pitch of the openings was 2 mm and the diameter of the lower ends was 2.5 mm. Poly methyl methacrylate having a refractive index n of 1.492 and a melt flow rate MFR ₁ of 1.2 was used as the core, a vinylidene fluoride copolymer having a refractive index n of 1.402 and a melt flow rate MFR ₃ of 6 was used as the sheath, and poly methyl methacrylate having a refractive index n of 1.492 and a melt flow rate MFR ₂ of 10.5 was used as the sea component. The poly methyl methacrylate as the core, the vinylidene fluoride copolymer as the sheath and the poly methyl methacrylate as the sea component were supplied and molten in melt extruders, and the core polymer, sheath polymer and sea polymer were supplied to the composite spinneret, whereby a light transmitting gathered fiber was obtained. Each of optical filaments forming the islands of the so obtained light transmitting gathered fiber had a diameter of 50 µ, and in the cross section, the core was clearly distinguished from the sheath and the cross section had a substantially circular shape. The matrix content was about 12 . It was found that the transmission loss of the gathered fiber was 310 dB Km, and an image could be sufficiently transmitted along a distance of 10 m. A light transmitting gathered fiber was prepared by using the same apparatus as used in Example 1 except that a spinneret having 1,500 holes was attached. Poly methyl methacrylate having a refractive index n of 1.492 and a melt flow rate MFR ₁ of 1.2 was used as the core, a vinylidene fluoride copolymer having a refractive index n of 1.402 and a melt flow rate MFR ₃ of 6 was used as the sheath, poly methyl methacrylate having a refractive index n of 1.492 and a melt flow rate MFR ₂ of 10.5 was used as the sea component, and polyethylene having a melt flow rate MFR ₄ of 8, in which 5 by weight of carbon was incorporated, was used as the protecting layer component. The poly methyl methacrylate as the core, the vinylidene fluoride as the sheath, the poly methyl methacrylate as the sea component and the polyethylene as the protecting layer component were supplied and molten in melt extruders. The core polymer, the sheath polymer, the sea polymer and the protecting layer forming polymer were supplied to the composite spinneret having 1,500 holes, whereby a light transmitting gathered fiber was obtained. The so obtained light transmitting gathered fiber had a rectangular cross section having a width of 1 mm and a height of 0.5 mm, and in the filaments constituting islands, the transmission loss was 450 dB Km in the peripheral portion and 440 dB Km in the central portion. Accordingly, the deviation of the light quantity was very small, and a very clear transmitted image could be obtained. For comparison, a gathered fiber was prepared in the same manner as described above except that the protecting layer was not formed. The transmission loss was 700 dB Km in the peripheral portion and 350 dB Km in the central portion, and the light quantity greatly differed according to the position. Incidentally, in the gathered fiber obtained in this example,
