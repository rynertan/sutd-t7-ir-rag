# Musical tone generating apparatus.

## Abstract
This apparatus is basically constructed by a memory M storing difference data D n and a data reproduction circuit 200 . The difference data is in advance obtained by converting a musical tone signal F t to be reproduced to digital sample data F n , effecting a linear prediction operation on the digital sample data F n to produce pre diction data FY n and calculating the difference D n between the digital sample data F n and the prediction data FY n . The stored difference data D n are sequen tially read from the memory M . In the data reproduction circuit 200 , the musical tone signal F t is reproduced by effecting a reverse operation of the linear prediction oper ation on the read difference data D n . In the case where the musical tone signal F t is a periodic signal, the effi ciency of the data compression is further enhanced by sub tracting from each difference data D n to be stored in the memory that difference data which was generated one pe riod of the musical tone signal F t before the generation of the each difference data D n . The efficiency of the data compression is more further enhanced by subtracting from each difference data that difference data which was gen erated a predetermined number of sampling intervals be fore the generation of the each difference data.
