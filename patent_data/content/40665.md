# Flame retardant polyphenylene oxide composition.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic polyphenylene oxide compositions such as polyphenylene oxide that has been modified with high impact polystyrene are rendered fire retardant by the addition of an effective amount of a 3 hydroxyalkyl phos phine oxide such as n butyl bis 3 hydroxypropyl phos phine oxide.
