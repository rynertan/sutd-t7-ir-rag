# Hydrogen storage.

## Abstract
For economically storing relatively large quantities of hydrogen, a hydrogen storage material comprises 1 a major R2Fe17 phase wherein the R is lanthanum, cerium and, optionally, other rare earth s such as praesodymium and neodymium, 2 an R min R min Fe2 eutectic where R min is lanthanum starved R, 3 an unalloyed lanthanum phase, and 4 an unalloyed iron phase. The material contains less than 55 by weight cerium based on the total weight of cerium, lanthanum and other rare earth s . Such a material is produced by an homogenising heat treatment.
