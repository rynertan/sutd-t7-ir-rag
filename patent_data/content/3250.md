# Multicolour electroluminescent display device.

## Abstract
A multicolour electroluminescent display device uses a layer 22 of material, e.g. ZnS Mn, of which the brightness voltage characteristic exhibits hysteresis, and a second layer 18 of material, e.g. ZnS Cu,Al, without hysteresis and with a different emission spectrum. An alternating voltage is applied across the layers and, initially, is divided such that the voltage across each layer is insufficient to excite either layer into emission. A voltage pulse is momentarily applied so as to excite the layer 22 into emission. After removal of the voltage pulse, the operating point of the layer 22 is such that the alternating voltage divides so as to excite, as required, either or both layers. In accordance with the value of the voltage pulse, any colour mixture of the colours emitted by the two layers can be displayed. The voltage pulse can be supplied by an X Y arrangement of electrodes 14, 26 or by an electron or light beam. The invention can be extended to three or more layers of electroluminescent material.
