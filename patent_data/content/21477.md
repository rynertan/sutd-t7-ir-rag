## Description
Compositions containing toxicants, their preparation and their use The invention relates to compositions containing toxicants, which compositions are especially suitable to be applied when a controlled release of the toxicant is required or desirable. The invention also relates t6 the preparation of such compositions and to the application thereof as pesticides. Many biocidally active compounds are far too toxic to be applied as such or even in the form of concentrated solutions thereof. Application in the form of a diluted solution is feasible but since in practice large scale applications are often envisaged, considerable amounts of solvent are required, which unfavourably affect the economy of the application at issue. Another difficulty consists in the storage of the toxicants.Due to their volatility properties premature release of the active compounds from their solutions may occur and hence storage has to be effected at very low temperatures, e.g. of 50C or less. It has been considered to apply the compounds in the form of dispersions in solid wax, but although in some instances satisfactory results are achieved, drawbacks are the sometimes difficult preparation of these dispersions and the usually insufficient stability thereof, so that soon after preparation, phase separation takes place. It has now been found that compositions with improved stability can be obtained in which toxicants are dispersed in a continuous phase in the form of inclusions of relatively uniform size. According to the invention a composition comprises an oil having dispersed therein a number of inclusions which contain a toxicant and a dispersing agent, the average diameter of said inclusions being between 10 and 10 5m. Useful applications of the composition include the use of systemic insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulants and anthelmintics, in each instance one or more toxicants, suitable for the envisaged use, being selected for incorporation in the composition. It is to be understood that in the context of the present application the meaning of toxic ants includes plant growth regulants. The compositions according to the invention are in particular of value when the oil is a solid and the toxicant is a systemic pesticide, i.e. when they take the form of controlled release matrices, usually in the form of granules or pellets, which are placed in the soil, in the vicinity of the root system of young plants or germinating plant seeds, where they will release their toxicant s at a predictable rate into the soil. If the systemic pesticide is incorporated near the root system of a plant, the toxicant may be absorbed and transported to the stem and leaves of the plant, where by virtue of its presence in the plant sap at active concentrations, it will protect the upper plant from pest attack. A preferred group of toxicants consists of compounds characterised by a pentavalent phosphorus atom having attached thereto two alkoxy groups, one vinyloxy or substituted vinyloxy group and a divalent oxygen moiety. Especially preferred examples of this category include the systemic insecticides dimethyl l methyl 2 dimethylcarbamoyl vinylphosphate dicrotophos and dimethyl cis l methyl 2 methyl carbomoylvinylpho sphate monocrotophos . Another preferred group of toxicants consists of compounds characterised by the presence of a carbamoyl alkylthiooxime group in the molecule, a much preferred example being the systemic insecticide l methylthio N N methylcarbamoyl ethane oxime methomyl . Yet another preferred group of toxicants consists of compound characterised by the presence of a 2 chlorovinyldialkylphosphate group in the molecule, for example chlorfenvinphos BIRLANE Trade Mark and dichlorvos VAPONA Trade Mark . The continuous phase or oil phase in the compositions according to the invention may be liquid or solid. Preferably a liquid or solid wax is employed. Suitable waxes include natural waxes such as beeswax, plant wax and paraffin wax and synthetic waxes such as hydrogenated oils and hydrocarbons of substantially paraffinic nature. In view of the envisaged controlled release applications, the compositions preferably comprise a solid paraffin wax as the continuous phase. It has been found that various categories of dispersing agents are suitable to be used in the preparation of stable, toxicant containing compositions. As a rule liquid emulsions can be formed by mechanical mixing of the constituents of the composition, which emmulsions are stable for at least 30 minutes and often for 60 minutes or even more, stable periods of at least 100 minutes being no exception. According to the invention the compositions are found to be stable when the average diameter of the inclusions dispersed in the emulsions is between 10 and lo.5m. Preferably their average diameter is within the range of 2.10 and 5.10 and in most instances they are relatively uniformly sized. A preferred preparation method, resulting in the formation of solid compositions having uniformly sized inclusions with an average size within the range as indicated above, consists in adding under stirring a toxicant to a liquid mixture of an oil and a dispersing agent and, after emulsification, dividing the stirred mixture into discrete drops which are allowed by cooling to solidify in a reception zone. If desired the dispersion may also be formed by heating all ingredients together till the solids are molten followed by stirring the obtained liquid mixture at elevated temperature. The formed drops may be collected on a cooled surface on which they solidify as hemispherical pellets.Also the stirred mixture may be divided into small droplets by atomisation of the mixture with the aid of a gasstream, e.g. a stream of air, the droplets thus formed being allowed to solidify before they reach a wall of the reception zone. By sieving, droplets of roughly the same size may be recovered, if desired. A preferred category of dispersing agents which may advantageously be used for the above mentioned preparation of the compositions, consists in various, usually highly dispersed types of silica. Thus hydrophilic colloidal silicas have found to be very suitable dispersing agents, in particular fumed silicas such as some commercially available Aerosil Trade Mark grades, e.g.Aerosil 200. Hydrophobic silicas are also suitable dispersing agents.These are surface modified silicas, preferably colloidal, in which hydroxy groups on the surface have been removed or replaced by inert groups, usually alkyl groups. They can easily be obtained by reaction of hydrophilic silicas with organic compounds such as dimethyl dichlorosilane and the like. A very suitable hydrophobic silica is Aerosil R 972. Another preferred group of dispersing agents consists of products resulting from cation exchange reactions between an organic base and a clay mineral. In these exchange reactions cations from the clay mineral lattice are removed and instead thereof organic cations are introduced. The organic cations are suitably derived from organic nitrogen bases such as quaternary ammonium salts and addition salts of amines. Long chain amines, e.g. amines containing a substantially linear alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms are generally preferred in this connection.Representative examples include trimethyl octadecenyl ammoniumchloride and dimethyloctadecylammoniumchloride. A preferred example of a clay mineral is montmorillonite.Recommended dispersing agents of this group are, inter alia, the commercially available BENTONE s Trade Mark , e.g. BENTONE 34 and BENTONE 38. Still another category of preferred dispersing agents consists in the group formed by optionally ethoxylated homopolymers of alkylacrylates and copolymers of alkylacrylates and vinyl compounds.Preferred alkylacrylates are those with alkyl groups of 14 24 carbon atoms and in particular alkylacrylates are preferred in which the alkyl group contains from 18 to 20 carbon atoms.Suitable vinyl compounds include vinylaromatic compounds include vinylaromatic compounds and vinyl heteroaromatic compounds, in particular vinylpyridines, e.g. 3 vinylpyridine and 4 vinylpyridine. Recommended dispersing agents falling within this category include various commercially available polymeric compounds indicated as Shellswims Trade Mark in particular Shellswim 5 which is a homopolymer of a C18 C20 alkylacrylate and Shellswim 11 which is a copolymer of a C18 C20 alkylacrylate and 4 vinylpyridine. No additional solvent is required, but if desired, these dispersing agents may be used dissolved in a suitable solvent such as toluene or xylene. A further preferred category of dispersing agents consists of low molecular weight oxidised polyethylene waxes. The molecular weight of these oxidised waxes is at most 5000. It has been observed that these agents often exhibit a favourable effect on the mechanical strength of the composition. A preferred dispersing agent of this category is the commercially available product BASFWax OA. A further example is the commercial product of AlliedChemical A C62g. The compositions according to the invention may be applied in the form of liquid emulsions which are sprayed on a locus to be treated with the toxicant, optionally after dilution with suitable solvents. Preferably they are applied in the solid form, conveniently in the form of pellets or granules. The amount of toxic ant in the composition is not critical and may vary within relatively wide ranges, but amounts in the range of w w preferably in the range of 5 10 w, calculated on the total composition are recommended for most practical purposes. When the toxicant is a pesticide, the invention further includes a method of combating pests at a locus which comprises applying to the locus a composition of the invention. The amount of dispersing agent to some extent is determined by the category from which it is selected, as well as by the quantity of toxicant to be dispersed in the composition. In general, amounts in the range of 1 10w, calculated on the total composition are suitable, amounts in the range of 2 5 w, on the same basis, being preferred. It has been found that in a number of cases, when applying the compositions according to the invention, still more favourable results are obtained if the compositions in addition comprises one or more additives. Thus additives may be incorporated in the compositions for the purpose of optimising the toxicant release rate or for the purpose of improving the mechanical strength of the composition. As examples of suitable additives for the optimisation of the release rate polyethylenegylcol 6000 and polyvinylbutyral e.g. the commercially available product MOWITAL B3CT Trade Mark may be mentioned. Also suitable are block copolymers obtained by addition of ethylene oxide to an ethylene glycol base, followed by addition of propylene oxide. Many of these block copolymers are commercially available products, indicated as Pluriols Trade Mark or Pluronic R Trade Mark grades. 1,Pluriol. RPE 2540 is a particularly preferred additive. Additives for improving the mechanical strength may be examplified with copolymers of ethylene and vinylacetate e.g.the commercially available product ELVAX Trade Mark and copolymers of ethylene and ethylacrylate e.g. the commercially available product Zetafax Trade Mark . The amounts of addtive s to be incorporated in the compositions may suitably be in the range of 0.5 to 10 w, calculated on the total composition, preferably in the range of 1 to 5 w, on the same basis. The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples, of which Examples 1 to 9 are in accordance with the invention, Example 10 being included for comparative purposes.Example 1 a Preparation of the composition A vessel provided with an inlet, a bottom outlet and equipped with a variable speed stirrer, was charged with a paraffin wax Shell Fully Refined Paraffin FRP wax, 145 1500F . The wax was heated until it was molten and a dispersing agent, silica K 320DS a commercially available hydrophilic fumed silica was added. 0The mixture was kept at 100 C and under stirring NUDRIN Trade Mark methomyl was added. The amounts charged to the vessel were 40g dispersing agent and 100 g NUDRIN, the remainder up to 1 kg being Shell FRP wax. After emulsification the dispersion was gradually discharged from the vessel and with the aid of a perpendicularly blown in stream of hot air was sprayed into a reception or shot tower where the droplets solidified to granules which were collected. b Testing of the composition The release rate of NUDRIN into water from granules of the composition prepared as mentioned under a was measured by a laboratory immersion test according to the following procedure Accurately weighed quantities 100 mg of the size fraction between 0.71 mm and 1.0 mm diameter were measured into a number of 125 cm3 glass bottles, then 100 g of distilled water was added to each. The bottles were provided with metal screw caps with rubber liners, the screw caps being additionally lined with close fitting discs of aluminium foil in order to prevent minimise contact of the liquid with the rubber liner. The bottles were attached to a wheel having a diameter of 90 cm rotatable at 333 rpm. in a room maintained at a constant temperature of 230C. Individual bottles were removed from the wheel at 1 hour intervals over a 7 hour test period. The amount of methamyl that had been released into the aqueous phase after each time period was determined by filtration of the entire sample through a small plug of glass wool followed by W spectrophotometry at 234 mm against methomyl solutions of known concentrations. From the results it could be deduced that 50 of the methomyl originally contained in the granules was released after 9 hours immersion.Example 2 a According to the method described in Example l a , a composition was prepared in which instead of silica 50 g BENTONE 34 was used as dispersing agent, the amount of wax being the remainder up to 1 kg total mixture. BENTONE 34 is a commercially avaiable gellant ex Abbey Chemicals Ltd. . b According to the procedure of Example l b , 50 of the methomyl was released into water after 230 days.Example 3 a According to the method of Example l a a composition was prepared in which the following ingredients were used The toxicant was BIDRIN dicrotophos or dimethyl l methyl 2 dimethylcarbamoyl vinylphosphate which was applied in an amount of 100 g. The dispersing agents were BENTONE 34, applied in an amount of 23 g and 100 g of BASF wax CA admixed with 20 g of an Additive, MOWITAL B30T, a commercially available product ex Hoechst . The remainder up to 1 kg was Shell FRP wax, 145 0 150 F. b Release rate determination BIDRIN A 25 g sample of the granules prepared as described inExample 3 a was classified into size fractions by shaking through a nest of 200 mm sieves for 15 mins, using a Pascall shaker. Accurately weighed 2 g samples of the fraction between sieves BS 16 BS 22 0.71 1.00 mm were weighed into two 125 cm3 glass bottles, 100.0 0.2 g of distilled water was added to each, and the bottles were carefully sealed with foil lined aluminium caps. The bottles were attached to the rotating wheel 90 cm diameter rotating at 333 rpm in a room maintained at 2310C. The bottles were sampled at intervals, and 100 ul aliquots drawn off and diluted at 10.00 cm3 with acetone in volumetric flasks. The release rate bottles were made up to 100 cm3 with the addition of 100 ul distilled water, and returned to the rotating wheel. The contents of the volumetric flasks were analysed forBIRDRIN by direct injection into a Pye 104 GLC fitted with FPD detection in the phosphorus mode, using the following conditions Column 1 m x 3 mm i.d. glassStationary phase 2 Silar 9 CP on Gas Chrom Q 100 200 mesh 0Oven temperature 200 C Flow rates N2 120 cm3 min l 2 3 . 1 H2 300 cm mln cm minRetention time 2.4 minsRetention time 2. 4 mins The results showed that 50 of the orginal BIDRIN content of the granules was released in 29 days.Example 4 a Similarly as in the previous Examples a composition was prepared comprising the following ingredients BIDRIN 100 g dispersing agents Shellswim 5, commercially available 60 g and BASF Wax OA 100 g and Shell FRP wax being the remainder up to a total of 1 kg. b The results of the toxicant release rate test, determined as described in Example 3 b showed that 50 of the BIDRIN was released from the granules into water in 27 days.Example 5 a Similarly as in the previous Examples, a composition was prepared comprising the following ingredients BIDRIN 86 g dispersing agent BENTONE 38, a commercially available gellant ex Abbey Chemicals Ltd. 50 g the remainder up to 1 kg being Shell High Melting Paraffin lIMP wax, 185 1900F. b The results of the toxicant rate test, determined as described in Example 3 b showed that 50 of the orginally contained BIDRIN was released into water in 23 daysExample 6 a Similarly as in the previous Examples a compostion was prepared of which the ingredients were NUDRIN 100 g dispersing agents Shellswim 11, commercially available 50 g and BASF wax OA 100 g , remainder up to 1 kg Shell 0FRP wax 145 150 F. b The results of the toxicant release test, determined as described in Example l b , showed that 50 of the originally contained methomyl was released into water in 42 days.Example 7 0.30 g Pluriol RPE 2540, 1.00 g Wax OA and FRP wax, being the remainder up to a total of 10 g accounting for the amount of toxic ant still to be added, were heated together to 1030C until the wax was molten BIDRIN 1.17 g was subsequently added and dispersed in the mixture by the ministirrer. An excellent translucent dispersion was obtained in which only after 94 minutes the first signs of settlement of liquid were observed, and, after 85 minutes, a slight clearing in the top 5 of the dispersion. When the composition was converted to granules by the method described in Example l a and examined for toxicant release by the method described in Example 3 b , it was found that 50 of the originally contained BIDRIN was released into water in 25 days.Example 8 1.02 g NUDRIN, 0,50 g Pluriol RPE 2540, 1.00 g Wax OA and 0FRP Wax 145 150 F, being the remainder up to a total of 10 g, were heated together at 1030C till the solids were molten. By stirring with the ministirrer a uniform, slightly milky dispersion was formed. First signs of settlement of free liquid were observed at 42 minutes after cessation of stirring. When the composition was converted to granules by the method described in Example l a , and examined for toxicant release by the method described in Example l b , it was found that 50 of the methomyl was released into water in 21 days.Example 9 1.02 g NUDRIN, 1.00 g Wax OA and FRP Wax 145 1500F, being the remainder up to a total of 10 g, were heated together at 100 C until all three ingredients were molten. By stirring with the mini stirrer a uniform, milky emulsion was formed which remained completely stable for 120 minutes. Thereafter, slight clearing of the emulsion was evident just under the top surface. When the composition was converted to granules by the method described in Example l a and examined for toxicant release by the method described in Example l b , it was found that 50 of the methomyl was released into water in 145 days. In each of Examples 1 to 9, the average diameter of the inclusions was in the range 10 to 10 5m. Example 10 For comparison only 1.17 g BIDRIN and 0.50 g of an additive Pluriol SC 9361, a commercially available polyol, not according to the invention, exBASF were dispersed into molten FRP Wax at 1030C, the amount ofWax being the remainder up to 10 g. When stirring was stopped the formed emulsion was unstable and broke within 20 seconds after cessation of stirring.
