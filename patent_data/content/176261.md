# A FROTHER COMPOSITION AND A FROTH FLOTATION PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF COAL VALUES FROM RAW COAL

## Abstract
A frother composition and a process for recovering coal from raw coal by subjecting the raw coal, in the form of an aqueous pulp, to a flotation process, wherein the frother composition comprises the reaction product of 1 a polyhy droxy alkane having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a mono or di saccharide and 2 propylene oxide, or a mixture of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, with the proviso that at least 50 mole percent of the mixture is propylene oxide, and the reaction product has a molecular weight of from 150 to 1400. The process is particularly effective in the selective recovery of fine particle size of coal of a size of less than about 90 mirometer.
