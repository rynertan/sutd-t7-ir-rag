# DECOUPLING CAPACITOR AND METHOD OF FORMATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A decoupling capacitor and method of forming the same, and a novel multilayer ceramic capacitor chip con struction is presented. In the method, a conductor 14 having a lead 18 connected thereto is formed from a continuous strip of electrically conductive material 10 , the strip having opposing planar surfaces. A dummy lead 20 , associated with the conductor 14 , but isolated therefrom, is also formed from the strip 10 . Two such strips 10, 10 lead frames are then spaced apart in a parallel orientation and a strip of insulating material 28 having a plurality of openings or windows 34 therein is sandwiched betwen the two lead frames 10, 10 . A novel multi layer ceramic capacitor chip 38 having conductive electrodes 46 , 44 on the top and bottom surfaces thereof is inserted into each window 34 so that the top and bottom electrodes 46 , 44 respectively contact a conductor from each lead frame. Preferably, conductive epoxy is used to effect an electrical and mecha nical connection between the capacitor chip electrodes and the lead frame conductors 14, 14 . Thereafter, a top strip 30 of outer insulating material is positioned across from one opposing surface of a first conductive strip 10 and a bottom strip 32 of outer insulating material is positioned on another opposing surface of a second conductive strip 10 . The top and bottom outer insulating layers 30, 32 sand wiching the pair of parallel conductive strips 19, 10 are then heat tacked and hot press laminated to form a continuous strip of laminated material. Finally, the now sealed and laminated decoupling capacitor is severed from the pair of lead frames. The decoupling capacitor of the present invention will thus be both hermetically sealed and automatically insertable for use in conjunction with inte grated circuit DIP inserter devices.
