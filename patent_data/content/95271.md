# Low profile connector providing high density application.

## Abstract
An improved electrical connector 10 is disclosed which enables assembly of a plurality of like connectors 10 in a high density array to mate with continuous rows of pin terminals 74 without requiring gaps in the terminals or missing many pin terminals. The connectors 10 have profiled ends 30 which enhance stackability of the connec tors so that the end most terminals 54 of adjacent connectors 10 are spaced apart a distance no greater than twice the distance between adjacent terminals 54 in a single connector 10 .
