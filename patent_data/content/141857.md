# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING RE CHARGEABLE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE.

## Abstract
An alloy capable of reversibly occluding or releasing lithium ion in a lithium ion containing non aqueous electro lyte upon charging or discharging is promising as a cathode of a rechargeable electrochemical device. This alloy cathode is incorporated in an electrochemical device in combination with lithium connected to be conductive with the alloy, and an electrolyte is added thereto to occlude lithium in or on the alloy cathode in the device. This process enables one to avoid cracking of the cathode.
