## Claims
1. A method wherein a metallic layer is deposited on an N type semiconductive region of a structure placed in a highly evacuated chamber to form a rectifying junction between a first portion of the N type region and a segment of the metallic layer and an electrical conductor is created to ohmically contact a second portion of the N type region, characterized by the step of introducing at least one selected gas into the chamber during the deposition step in order to control the voltage VF between the metallic segment and the conductor when the rectifying junction is forwardly conductive.

## Description
This invention relates to methods for controlling the forward voltage across a Schottky diode consisting of an N type semiconductor and a metallic layer such as aluminium. Metal semiconductor rectifying elements, usually referred to as Schottky diodes, are used extensively in bipolar integrated circuits IC s . In making a Schottky diode, a partly finished IC having an N type semiconductive region that acts as the cathode is typically placed in a deposition chamber whose pressure is reduced to a very low level. A metal or metallic alloy is evaporatively deposited on the N type region. The resulting metallic layer is then selectively etched to divide it into a number of separated segments. One of these is the anode that forms a rectifying junction with a portion of the N type region. Another of the metallic segments is the cathode contact which ohmically adjoins another portion of the N type region more highly doped than the first mentioned portion. The threshold voltage V For some types of Schottky diodes such as aluminium silicon Schottky diodes, V This invention is based on the discovery that the presence absence of certain gases such as oxygen, argon, and nitrogen during low pressure deposition of a metal such as aluminium on an semiconductor to form a Schottky diode influences its threshold forward voltage. In particularly, a metallic layer is deposited on an N type semiconductive region of a structure placed in a highly evacuated chamber to form a Schottky rectifying junction between a first portion of the N type region and a segment of the metallic layer. During the deposition step, at least one selected gas is introduced into the chamber to control the voltage V The deposition step is preferably done by evaporative techniques at an initial chamber pressure no greater than 10 ⁵ torr. If, for example, the metallic layer is substantially aluminium while the N type region is silicon, injection of oxygen or argon into the chamber causes V Like reference symbols are used in the drawings and the description of the preferred embodiment to represent the same or very similar item or items. In the present invention, the threshold forward voltage V Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a guard ring Schottky diode fabricated in accordance with the invention. The following discussion illustrates how V The starting material is a boron doped P mono crystalline silicon substrate 20 into which arsenic is selectively diffused at the general location for a buried region 22. After exposing the top of substrate 20, an arsenic doped N layer 24 is epitaxially grown on the upper substrate surface. The net average dopant concentration of epitaxial layer 24 is no greater than 2 10¹⁷ atoms cm³ 0.05 ohm cm so that the diode junction will be rectifying rather than ohmic or non rectifying. The net dopant concentration of layer 24 is preferably 1.4 10¹⁶ atoms cm³ 0.45 ohm cm . During epitaxial growth and subsequent processing, the arsenic suitably redistributes to form highly doped N buried region 22 at a sheet resistance of about 800 ohms square. A layer of silicon dioxide is thermally grown along the top of the structure. After opening a suitable window through this oxide layer, boron is diffused in through the window to form a highly doped annular P region 26 extending into substrate 20. P region 26 laterally surrounds an active semiconductor portion 28 of N layer 24 in such a manner as to laterally electricaIly isolate portion 28 from other such active semiconductor portions in a wafer containing the structure. Silcion dioxide is thermally grown on the top of the structure to close the window after which a new window is opened in the resulting oxide layer. Borin is diffused in through the new window to form a shallow highly doped P guard ring 30 that laterally surrounds the intended location for a rectifying junction 32. The steps of oxide growth, new window opening, and diffusion are repeated with phosphorus to form a shallow highly doped N portion 34 generally at the intended location for an ohmic junction 36 to the cathode contact for the diode. N plug 34 has a net N type dopant concentration of about 5 10²¹ atoms cm³ 10 ohms square . More silicon dioxide is thermally grown to close the window for plug 34. Layer 38 is the resulting oxide layer that adjoins active region 28. Next windows are opened through oxide layer 38 at the sites for junctions 32 and 36. The window for rectifying junction 32 extends over the inside upper periphery of guard ring 30. The structure is cleaned after which any silicon dioxide remaining in the windows is etched away. The wafer containing the structure is now put into a metal deposition apparatus shown in Fig. 2. In particular, the wafer is one of wafers 40 placed on a planetary 42 in a deposition chamber 44 of the apparatus. A vacuum pump 46 is activated to reduce the pressure in chamber 44 to at least 1,333 10 ³ Pa. The chamber pressure is preferably reduced to about 6,666 10 ⁵ Pa. Heating lamps 48 set the temperature in chamber 44 at a value from room temperature to about 450 C. The chamber temperature is preferably 150 C. After planetary 42 starts rotating, a residual gas analyzer 50 activates one of control valves 52 to enable a small flow of a selected gas from one of gas bottles 54 to enter chamber 44 through the associated one of gas inlets 56. During the gas injection and metal deposition, vacuum pump 46 continues running so as to maintain an operating pressure of about 1,33 10 ⁴ Pa in chamber 44. Gas analyzer 50 measures the partial pressure of the selected gas utilizing a sensor 58 located in chamber 44. This feedback loop enables analyzer 50 to adjust the flow rate of the selected gas to the value necessary to achieve a desired partial pressure. An electron beam unit in a metal source 60 heats up a melt source of substantially pure aluminium to cause Al atoms to vaporize. After analyzer 50 has established the desired partial pressure for the gas, a shutter in metal source 60 is opened. Al atoms evaporatively deposit on the upper surface of the structure in Fig. 1 to form junctions 32 and 36. When an aluminium thickness of 0.6 0.8 µm is reached, the shutter is closed to turn off source 60. Subsequently, the activated valve 52 is turned off to stop the gas injection. Wafers 40 are removed from chamber 44 af after venting to atmospheric pressure. The aluminium layer is then selectively etched to produce aluminium segments 62 and 64. Al segment 62 is the anode for the Schottky diode. Al segment 64 is the external contact to the cathode which generally consists of the n type portion of active region 28. When the diode is forwardly conductive, positive current from anode 62 travels down wards across junction 32, through the underlying part of active region 28, along buried region 22, and upward through highly doped portion 34 to cathode contact 64. V Oxygen, argon, and nitrogen have been examined as the gas injected into chamber 44 during Al deposition. The table below shows how injection of one of these gases causes V The table shows that V Further tests were done to deterine how V Similar graphs can be prepared for oxygen and nitrogen. Suitable choice for the injected gas and its partial pressure therefore allows V While the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, this description is solely for the purpose of illustration and is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention claimed below. For example, the gas flow for the selected gas could be turnd off before the end of the metal deposition step. Two or more gases could be simultaneously introduced into the deposition chamber during metal deposition. Thus, various modifications and applications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
