# Method and device for counting sheet material.

## Abstract
A laser beam 3 is directed by mirrors 4,5 at a conveyor belt 9 with overlapping sheet products 8 . The laser beam is reflected against at least two measuring cells 12,13,14 . Each edge 10 passing the point of reflection is shown in the sign als from the measuring cells, and by compositing the signals in various ways in a computer 15 , disturbances due to vary ing amounts of color on the copy, thickness and form of the edges 10 , folds etc. can be eliminated, producing a curve which exactly and precisely shows how many products have passed on the belt 9 . Using a laser as a light source provides a parallely focusable, very powerful light beam, which makes it possible to count thin, tightly spaced and heavily colored products.
