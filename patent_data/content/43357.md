An elongate locking means 28 , for example a safety chain, is arranged between each pair of adjacent storage racks 11,12 one end of which is secured to one storage rack 11 . The other end of the locking means is in the form of a contact member 27 , which for starting a process of movement co acts with a stationary contact member 30 in the said storage rack 11 . The contact member 27 of the locking means is also connectible to the adjacent storage rack 12 for mechanical locking of the passageway which can be formed between the storage racks 11,12 .
