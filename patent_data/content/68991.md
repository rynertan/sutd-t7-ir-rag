# Data buffer.

## Abstract
A buffer 14 can exchange data between a computer SL having a plurality of lines 41 and a device MC . One of these lines BH, H1, H2 , a halt line, can transmit a halt signal when the computer has halted. The buffer 14 includes a plurality of transmitters 44, 46, 50, 60, 74, 76, 80, 82, 96, 98 and a plurality of controlled receivers 66, 68, 70, 72, 84, 86, 100, 102, 108, 110 . A halt transmitter 46 is included among the plurality of transmitters. The transmitters are separately connected to predetermined respective ones LS1a, LSNa, LS1b, LSNb, L51c, LSNc, X1, XN, A1, AN of the plurality of lines for transmitting their signals to the device MC . The halt transmitter 46 is connected to the halt line BH, H1, H2 for transmitting the halt signal to the device MC . The receivers are connected between the device MC and given respective ones of the plurality of lines LM1b, LMNb, HLX, BC, X1, XN, A1, AN, AN 1, AN M for coupling to them signals from the device MC . Each one of a predetermined set 100, 102 from the plurality of receivers has a receive terminal H1 commonly connected to the halt line H1 for enabling operation of this predetermined set 100, 102 in response to the halt signal.
