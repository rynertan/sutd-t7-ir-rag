# Process for the preparation of carboxylic anhydrides.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of a carboxylic anhydride by reacting under virtually water free conditions an ester having the formula R¹COOCH₂R² or an ether having the formula R³OR⁴ in which R¹, R³ and R⁴ represents substituted or non substituted hydrocarbon groups and R² represents hydrogen or a substituted or non substituted hydrocarbon group with carbon monoxide in the presence of a nickel catalyst, an iodide and or bromide source and at least one co promoter, characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a compound having the formula
