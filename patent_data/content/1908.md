# Electrical connector housing.

## Abstract
An insulating housing is moulded in one piece with a body portion 20 having a terminal receiving cavity 23 open at a top and a flat base 22 . A supporting rib 30 extends from a sidewall of the body and has a downwardly extending, resiliently flexible finger 40 at a free end and a downwardly extending surface 34 at a root end. The housing is received in a winding receiving cavity defined by adjacent pole pieces 9 of a stator with the base 22 seated on the face 16 of the stator and the finger 40 and surface 34 within the cavity clamping the housing to the stator.
