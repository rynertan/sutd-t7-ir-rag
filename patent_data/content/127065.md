# A comminuting machine, especially for emulsifying or fine comminuting of meat products.

## Abstract
In a machine for the fine comminuting and or emulsify ing of e.g. forcemeat with a conveyor worm 2 and a cutting device 6 comprising at least one cutter or knife set and at least one perforated disc, the diameters of the exit section 11 of the conveyor worm 2 and the surrounding section 9 of the housing of the cutting device 6 increase in the direction of conveying, and the machine is adapted to be driven by a motor 13 with at least one relatively high speed of rotation. When operating with a high rotational speed, this arrangement results in that the exit end of the conveyor worm 2 together with the surrounding section 9 of the housing of the cutting device 6 act as a centrifugal pump with axial entry and exit, so that the pressure, with which the material is fed to the cutting means, is increased, and the throughput capacity of the machine is also increased due to the higher pressure produced. Sealing problems due to the increased pressure are avoided by placing the seal 17 for the drive shaft 3 of the conveyor worm 2 in the inlet hopper 1 on the side opposite the cutting device 6 , where the pressure is relatively low due to the worm carrying the material away. Thus, a simple lip seal or the like may be used.
