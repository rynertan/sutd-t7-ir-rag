## Description
PROCESS FOR DEPOSITING METALLIC COPPER This invention relates to a process for depositing metallic copper on a substrate. US A 3,356,527 discloses a process for depositing copper by heating the vapour of a fluorinated copper chelate. According to the present invention, metallic copper is deposited on a substrate by containing the vapour of a fluorlnated organic copper compound in an enclosed chamber containing the substrate, and decomposing the copper compound by subjecting it to light so that metallic copper is deposited on the substrate. The present invention ls particularly userul tor producing a patterned deposit of copper, for example in the bullding of structures in or on a semiconductor or other electrlcal device, or on a coatlng. The process of the present invention can be carried out in a photothermal mode and also in a photochemical mode. it is possible that both modes may occur simultaneously. In the photothermal mode, the light from a laser is absorbed by the surface of the substrate which locally heats and thereby causes thermal chemical transformation to copper of the copper compound that comes into contact with it. In the photochemical mode, the vapour of the copper compound, in the gas phase or adsorbed onto the surface of the substrate, absorbs light and undergoes excltation and subsequent chemical reaction to yield copper atoms which deposit on the surface of the substrate. When carrying out the invention in the photochemical mode, the light can be from a laser and it can also be from incoherent light sources, such as a Hg mercury arc lamp.In the photochemical mode, the irradiation should take place in the presence of another vapour which acts as a source of hydrogen atoms and becomes a co reductant. The most preferred such material is ethanol. Any alcohol possessing an alpha hydrogen atom could also be used, as could other compounds having a weak carbon to hydrogen bond. The photothermal mode lends itself best to direct write deposition using a narrowly focused laser beam, i.e. no prior patterning or masking of any type is required and writing is achieved by moving the substrate or laser beam. In the photochemical mode, focused beams, laser or incoherent light can be used, in which case a large area of the substrate can be covered with copper metal. In carrying out selectively patterned deposition, the radiation can be patterned by the use ot masks, by focusing devlces, and by other procedures known to the prior art. This removes the need for patterning the substrate by lithographic means. No special apparatus is required for carrying out the process. The substrate is simply placed in an enclosed chamber and the vapour of the fluorinated organic copper compound is introduced. When the process is to be in the photochemical mode, ethanol vapour, for example, is also introduced. Irradiation is then carried out, and the deslred copper deposition results. The most desirable fluorinated organic copper compound for use in the present invention is bis 1,1,1 , ,5 ,5 hexafluoro 2 ,4 pentanedionate copper it . The preparation of thls compound is described in InorganicChemistry, Vol.5, No. 3, March 1966 by Bertrand and Kaplan. Its name is usually wrltten simply as Cu hfac 2. Other useful compounds include, for example, fluorinated derivatives of acyl or acetylacetonate copper complexes. Mixtures of materials may also be used. Preferred substrates include SiO2, alumina, sapphire and silicon, but any ot a very large number of materials would be suitable. Such materials include, for example, polymeric coatings and other materials used either as insulators or semiconductors. Imagewise vapour phase seeding for plating applications is a desirable improvement over present seeding techniques in that present techniques require masking and ultimate removal of the seed in the unplated region, and are all wet processes. For circuitization, many techniques are available for patterning copper lines, but all require multiple process steps with masking and lithography. Direct patterned deposition, as in the present invention, eliminates the need for such steps. The copper deposition according to the present invention takes place at a rapid rate, and yields adherent deposits which have good electrical conductivity. Filling openlngs in large area films or lines or circuit lines is another application of the present invention. For example, if a copper circuit line 20 microns wide and 2 microns thigh is found to be defectlve by having part of its length missing, e.g. 50 microns of length, laser wrltten copper deposition can repair the defect by writing from one end of the opening to the other, thus providing a continuous, connecting, conducting, copper line. Examples of Photochemical Deposition of Copper Metal The air was evacuated from an enclosed chamber containing a quartz substrate. A mixture of Cu hrac 2 vapour and ethanol vapour was introduced into the chamber and irradiated with a mercury arc lamp. A copper mirror was formed on the quartz substrate by the deposition of metallic copper. All depositions were carried out at room temperature and at amblent Cu hfac 2 vapour pressure. The ethanol vapour pressure was also ambient. Copper films are also formed when the mixed vapours are likewise irradiated with pulses trom a XrF or ArF excimer laser. Examples of Photothermal Deposition of Copper Metal Using continuous light from an argon ion laser 515 457nm focused with either spherical or cylindrical lenses, copper metal was deposited from Cu hfac 2.H2Ox x O 2 vapour onto the following different substrates in separate operations quartz, silicon n and p type , alumina and sapphire in the form of spots, lines, and sheet type tilms. All depositions were carried out at room temperature and ambient Cu htac 2 vapour pressure c.13.3 Pascals . An inert gas such as nitrogen may be used as a carrier when desired. For example, irradiation of a silicon surface with power densities in the range of 2.7 5.5 x 105 watts cm , results in formation of copper spots at a rate of about 50 300 Clm3 serond. Typical spot diameters tormed with a 40 tnn focal spot are 50 100 gm. As another example, a copper line was formed by scanning a focused spot across a SiO2 film on a silicon water at a speed of 3.1 Wm sec and 2 a power density of 5 x 10 watts cm . It was about 4000 A thick and 130 Wm wide, and had a resistivity of 3.5 RQ cm. As another example, a copper line about 5000nm thick and 140 Wm wide was formed on alumina using a power density of 5 x 105 watts cm2 and a scan speed of 3 Wm sec. This line had a resistivity of 6.9 ssQ cm. As another example, copper sheet type films were formed by scanning a cylindrically focused beam across a silicon wafer in the presence of the copper containing organometallic vapour. The copper was found to be pure metal by X ray photoemission spectroscopy and Auger analysis, the only impurity being small traces of oxygen.
