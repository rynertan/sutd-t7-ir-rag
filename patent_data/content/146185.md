# Telephone circuit comprising a class B amplifier.

## Abstract
The telephone amplifier of an audio transmission circuit comprises a class B output stage as a result of which the re quired supply current of this amplifier is considerably lower than with prior art telephone amplifiers. A distorting voltage produced by the current signal in the supply current of the class B output stage does not affect the output signal of the telephone amplifier because the input stage and the output stage each comprise their own setting circuits which pro duce mutually independent setting voltages.
