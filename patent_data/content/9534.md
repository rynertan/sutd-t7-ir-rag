# Wavelength division system with reduced cross talking between each of the channels.

## Abstract
Digital transmission system on optical waveguide, in which a plurality of channels is transmitted as wavelength division multiplex on the same waveguide between pairs of transmitting and receiving stations, each transmitting station emitting an optical carrier modulated by a numerical data flow, characterized in that each channel is associated to sync hronizing means SF1, SF3...SFn, RO2,...ROn,SF RO SY , able to generate and maintain at the receiver a relative time delay between the channel itself and the adjacent channels in the multiplex, responsible for the interference, said delay being of the order of half the signalling period of the data flow, or of the order of half the signalling period of the quickest data flow.
