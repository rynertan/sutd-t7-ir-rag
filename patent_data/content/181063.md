# Colour enhancement.

## Abstract
Methods of electronically enhancing one or more colour components C, Y, M which together represent the chroma tic components of a pixel of an image are described. The methods comprise subtracting from each colour component respective quantities which when combined correspond to a grey level 4 to generate reduced colour components. These reduced colour components are then multiplied by a factor and the modified reduced colour components are then added back to the subtracted quantities or to the original colour components to generate enhanced colour compo nents 13, 14 , whereby the factor is chosen such that the hue of the original pixel is not substantially changed after enhancement. In one method, the magnitude of the maximum reduced colour component is determined and a factor is chosen which is related to the determined magnitude. In another method, the colour components are ranked in order of magnitude and compared to derive two equivalent colour component values. The magnitude of the maximum equiva lent colour component is determined and the factor chosen is related to the determined magnitude of a maximum equivalent colour component.
