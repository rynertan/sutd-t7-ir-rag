# Fuel treating device.

## Abstract
A fuel treating device comprises two pairs of magnets 10 and 14 , one pair positioned on each inlet for fuel and oxygen so that the incoming fuel is exposed to a magnetic field. Each pair of magnets 10 and 14 is positioned diametrically opposed about the inlet line 11 or 15 , with the south magnetic pole of each magnet placed upstream furthest away from the mixing zone. The magnets 10 and 14 are insulated from each other and from the inlet line 11 or 15 by nonmagnetic materials 17 , such as neoprene, which do not disrupt the magnetic field.
