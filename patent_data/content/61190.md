# An electrode device.

## Abstract
An electrode device for the determination of the partial pressure of CO₂, Pco₂, in particular an electrode device for transcutaneous determination of Pco₂. The interior electrolyte 6 of the electrode device is adapted to the exterior electrolyte 5 in such a manner that the potential difference measured over the exterior reference electrode 8 and the interior reference electrode 7 is substantially temperature independent with a temperature dependence for the CO₂ partial pressure determination in the range of 1C 1C. The interior electrolyte 6 preferably contains a pH buffer system based on phenyl phosphonic acid.
