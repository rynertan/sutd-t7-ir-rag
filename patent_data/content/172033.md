# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine the combustable mixture is drawn into an intake chamber 104 , compressed into a high pressure chamber 102 and released into the combustion chamber 105 at the moment of ignition. The invention is applicable to linear, rotary and two stroke engines. In a linear or rotary engine the high pressure chamber may be located within the vane 107 which acts as the piston.
