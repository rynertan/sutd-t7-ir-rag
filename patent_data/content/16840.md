# MULTIPURPOSE ACTUATOR.

## Abstract
An actuator driven by fluid pressure and which is practi cally usable and capable of operating linearly and rockably. Specifically, a universal actuator is disclosed, which can, with a small number thereof simply control complicated and high lev el functions that cannot be carried out by the conventional sin gle function actuator and which can also operate reliably, par ticularly as a rockable actuator, to be useful for rectilinear drive or the like, over a length much longer than the entire length of the actuator itself. To this end, the invention smoothly converts the reciprocating motion of a piston into rotary motion of a cir cular post member via a non telescoping but flexible transmis sion element, while leading the motion cut of a housing and connecting it to a load via a complete shaft sealing mechanism. The fact that the flexible transmission element does not tele scope through the housing assures high reliability and allows it to be applied to long rectilinear drive for construction machin ery, load handling machines, robot mechanisms, valve drive, and elevators, and also to the synchronization of a purality of loads, or sequence control.
