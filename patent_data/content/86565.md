# Keyless lock.

## Abstract
A keyless lock has a resident code disc having code pegs 284 defining a resident binary code. An input code disc 248 has slider pins 272 each movable between two positions corresponding with binary values 0 and 1 of the corresponding input code bit. Opening of the lock requires the two discs to be moved together and this is only possible if every slider pin 272 has been placed in the correct position so as not to foul the associated resident code peg 284 . The input code is entered by repeated movement of a handle 260 from a neutral position to either of two offset positions corresponding respectively with bit values 0 and 1 in the input code.

## Description
KEYLESS LOCK This invention relates to keyless locks. A variety of forms of keyless or combination locks have been produced, usually for high security applications. In general, these known locks are time consuming to open and require a significant degree of manual dexterity. With certain known locks, it is possible for unauthorised persons to open the lock without prior knowledge of the correct code or combination this being achieved by distinguishing correct from incorrect movements through sound or feel. In most cases, the services of a locksmith are required to alter the code of the lock. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved keyless lock which overcomes the above disadvantages. More particularly, it is one object of this invention to provide a keyless lock in which entry of the input code is considerably simplified. It is another object of this invention to provide a keyless lock having a fixed or resident code which can be readily changed by authorised persons. It is a further object of this invention to provide a keyless lock in which actions made to disarm the lock appear and sound the same whether the correct or incorrect code is being entered. Accordingly, the present invention consists in one aspect in a keyless lock comprising means establishing a resident code in the form of a series of binary code elements means for the sequential manual entry of an input code in the form of a series of binary code elements and means resisting opening of the lock in the absence of an input code matching the resident code. Preferably, the means for the entry of an input code includes a plurality of input code members each displaceable between two positions. Advantageously, the means for the entry of an input code includes handle means displaceable between alternative positions to indicate the value of successive input code elements. In another aspect, the present invention consists in a keyless lock comprising means establishing a resident code in the form of a series of binary code elements handle means manually actuable in either of two senses to indicate the value of a binary code element, repeated actuation of the handle means thereby serving for the entry of an input code and means resisting opening of the lock in the absence of an input code matching said resident code. Preferably, the handle means is displaceable from a neutral position into either of two alternative offset positions. In a further aspect, the present invention consists in a keyless lock comprising a bolt for securing the lock a resident code disc incorporating a sequence of resident binary code elements each located in either of two circular paths together to define a resident code handle means for entering an operative binary code sequence defining an input code an input code disc including a plurality of input code members each movable between positions corresponding respectively with said circular paths means actuable by said handle means for locating each input code member in the appropriate position in accordance with said input code means for merging said resident and input code discs coaxially in the presence of an input code matching said resident code, merging of said code discs being inhibited in the absence of an input code matching said resident code through mechanical interference between said resident binary code elements and said input code members and means inhibiting release of said bolt otherwise than when said code discs are coaxially merged. Suitably, the positions for each input code member are spaced radially of the input code disc. Preferably, the means for locating the input code members comprises a code setting member operable through said handle means, and means for rotating said input code disc to bring said input code members successively to said code setting member. Advantageously, the handle means is rotatable in opposite senses of rotation to different offset positions, rotation of the handle means in either sense serving to rotate the input code disc, operation of the code setting member being determined by the sense of rotation. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded view in partly diagrammatic form of a keyless lock according to the present invention Figure 2 is an exploded view illustrating a modification to the lock of Figure 1 with those parts which are unchanged fromFigure 1 omitted for the sake of clarity Figure 3 is a plan view of certain parts of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a plan view, partly in section, of a further keyless lock according to the present invention with certain parts omitted for the sake of clarity Figure 5 is a transverse section on line 5 5 of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a scrap view in direction X showing a detail of the lock of Figures 4 and 5 Figure 7 is an exploded view in partly diagrammatic form of a further keyless lock according to the present invention Figure 8 is a cut away perspective view illustrating a modification to the lock of Figure 4 Figure 9 is a perspective view illustrating a further modification to locks of Figure 4 or Figure 7 Figure 10 is a cut away perspective view illustrating a modification to the locks of Figure 1 or Figure 7, and Figure 11 is a perspective view in partly diagrammatic form of a further keyless lock according to the present invention. There is shown in Figure 1 a first embodiment of a keyless lock according to this invention. For the sake of clarity, theFigure takes the form of an exploded view. A mortice lock 10 comprises a face plate 12 and a hardened deadbolt 14 shown in the locked position. The striking plate is not shown. A handle 16 is rotatably mounted with respect to the lock housing not shown on a shaft 18 to which is secured a lever arm 20 forked to engage a pin 22 formed in the deadbolt.By turning the handle 16, the deadbolt can thus be withdrawn. The deadbolt 14 is formed at its inward end with a shoulder 24 engageable with a pawl 26 mounted for rotation about an axis 28. A fixed stud 30 serves to prevent movement of the deadbolt away from the pawl 26. A ring 32 is rotatably mounted in the lock and is formed with an integral, radially projecting lobe 34 engageable in an angular rest position with the pawl 26. This engagement between lobe 34 and pawl 26 prevents rotation of the pawl and in consequence inhibits withdrawal of the bolt. The lobe 34 is additionally connected pivotally to a fork 36, the limbs of which straddle a pin 38 in the deadbolt. A compression spring 40 is mounted between the pin and the fork. The ring 32 is further provided with radially projecting studs 42 which engage respective ramp surfaces 44 formed in the lock housing. It will be understood accordingly that rotation of the ring 32 is necessarily accompanied by upward axial movement. If an attempt is made to withdraw the deadbolt by rotation of the handle 16, the action of pin 38 and fork 36 will be to tend to cause rotational and upward movement of the ring 32. If the upward movement is not inhibited in the manner to be described hereinafter, the lobe 34 will by rotation be moved out of engagement with the pawl 26 allowing the pawl to move away from the shoulder 24, thus permitting withdrawal of the deadbolt. If upward movement of the ring 32 is inhibited, forces applied to the handle will be absorbed by spring 40 and the deadbolt will remain in the locked position. Mounted coaxially with the ring 32, the lock further comprises a resident code disc 46 and an input code disc 48.The resident code disc 46 is fixed against rotation but is capable of upward movement with the ring 32. The input code disc 48 is rotatably mounted with respect to the lock housing and can be rotated in a clockwise fashion by means of an escapement drive mechanism comprising pawls 50 and 52 formed integrally with an operating lever 54. The pawls 50 and 52 are engageable with teeth 56 formed at the periphery of the input code disc and the escapement drive is mounted in the housing for rotation about an axis 58. A handle 60 is mounted in the lock housing for rotation coaxially with respect to the input code disc. The handle carries an integral cam 62 having a first flat camming surface 64 and a second, arcuate camming surface 66 on a major radius and a third arcuate camming surface 68 on a minor radius. The flat camming surface 64 is engaged by the operating lever 54 of the escapement drive with a tension spring 70 acting between the escapement drive and the lock housing serving to maintain operating lever 54 in contact with the camming surface 64. The handle is capable of rotational movement in either rotational sense through approximately 300 such movement serving through the escapement drive to produce a rotation of the input code disc through one step.The rotation of the code disc is of course in the same sense irrespective of the sense of rotation of the handle 60. The input code disc 48 includes in radial alignment with each tooth 56 in its periphery, a radial groove 70 housing a slider pin 72 of dumb bell form. These pins are retained at the inner or outer extremes of the respective radial grooves 70 by a retainer ring not shown which acts over the major sector defined by radii A and B. Within the minor sector between radiiA and B, there is provided, above the input code disc 48, a funnel piece 74 which is pivotally mounted with respect to the lock housing through pin 76. A radial finger 78 formed integrally with the funnel piece engages camming surface 68 in the neutral position shown in Figure 1 and is maintained in engagement with this surface by means of compression spring 80 acting between the funnel piece 74 and the lock housing. In its surface adjacent the input code disc, the funnel piece is formed with a channel 82 the radial dimension of which decreases from the opening at location B which is equal to the radial extent of slot 70 to the opening at location A which is equal to the diameter of one slider pin. If the handle 60 is rotated clockwise from the neutral position shown in Figure 1, finger 78 moves along camming surface 68 with the position of the funnel piece remaining in consequence unchanged. The slider pin 72 which leaves the funnel piece at location A will thus be placed at the inner extremity of the corresponding radial slot 70. If the handle is moved anticlockwise, finger 78 will ride up onto larger radius camming surface 66, causing funnel piece 74 to rotate about pin 76 against the action of spring 80.Then, the slider pin leaving location A will be located at the outer radial extremity of slot 70. Resident code disc 46 is provided with pairs of holes 82 placed in radial alignment with the radial slots 70 of the input code disc, the holes of each pair being at the same radii as the inner and outer extremes respectively of the slots. Removable pegs 84 are placed in selected holes in either the inner or outer ring of holes, there being only one peg in any pair of holes.The holes in which pegs are placed in the resident code disc are selected according to the code or combination which permits the lock to be opened. The locations selected are the group of radial hole pairs nearest the location A, with the number of pegs being selected according to the length of input code required.The maximum code length is equal to the number of slider pins in the major sector AB. When the correct input code has been entered, those slider pins nearest location A which correspond with pairs of holes where a peg has been entered, will in each case be situated at the opposite end of the radial slot from the peg. In this condition, the input and resident codes can be said to match.The position of the remaining slider pins which overlie two empty holes 82 is irrelevant. It will be appreciated that with the correct code entered, no slider pin lies immediately above a peg so that when an attempt is made through fork 36 and lobe 34 to rotate the ring 32, the accompanying upward movement of the ring and resident code disc 46 can be accommodated by merging of the pegs amongst the slider pins. If an incorrect code has been entered, at least one slider pin will lie immediately above a peg so preventing upward movement of the ring and thus inhibiting withdrawal of the bolt. To give an example, the resident code of the lock shown inFigure 1 is 000111001101 with 1 being the binary value associated with clockwise movement of the handle and 0 with anticlockwise movement. To enable withdrawal of the bolt, the matching code 000111001101 must be entered through handle 60. It will be seen from the Figure that the code 00011100110 has already been entered that is to say that the eleven slider pins closest to location A, are arranged in the pattern 00011100110 with 0 representing a slider pin at the outer extremity of the slot achieved through anticlockwise rotation of the handle and 0 a slider pin at the inner extremity. To complete entry of the correct input code it is therefore necessary to make one further clockwise movement of the handle to deposit a slider pin at location A at the inner extremity of the radial slot. Users may prefer to refer to the required input code not as 000111001101 but as 332211 with each decimal digit referring to the number of consecutive handle operations in the same sense. The lock shown in Figure 1 can be operated from one side of the door only a modification to the lock enabling operation from both sides of a door, will now be described with reference to Figure 2. In the modified arrangement, a second handle 60 mounted coaxially but independently of the first handle 60, is provided on the opposite side of the door and has a cam 62 similar to cam 62. The operating lever 54 of the escapement drive shown in part only is provided with two connecting rods 102 which not only engage the flat camming surface 64 but also extend through the lock to engage the corresponding flat camming surface 64 of the second cam 62 . Similarly, finger 78 of the funnel piece 74 is provided with a connecting rod 104 which engages the curved camming surfaces of both first and second cams. Rotation of either handle in either sense will serve through the escapement drive mechanism to move the input code disc through one step. Moving the first handle clockwise will, as before, place the slider pin at location A in the inner extreme of its radial slot with anticlockwise movement displacing the funnel piece outwards and depositing a slider pin in the outer extreme of the slot. With the second handle 60 , it should be noted that the corresponding cam 62 has its curved camming surface 68 at the minor radius displaced circumferentially with respect to that of the first cam. This is seen most clearly in the detail view which is Figure 3. It follows that whilst senses of rotation of the two handles are reversed, clockwise movement of either handle will still result in a slider pin being deposited in the inner extreme of the corresponding radial slot similarly for anticlockwise movement. The same input code can thus be entered from either side of the door. A more radical modification is illustrated in Figures 4, 5 and 6. In these Figures, the deadbolt and its operating parts have been omitted for the sake of clarity certain other parts have for the same reason been shown diagrammatically. In this embodiment, the input code disc 148 is of annular form and is provided with a ring of inwardly directed drive teeth 156. These teeth are engaged by an escapement mechanism shown diagrammatically through pawls 150 and 152 and having camming pins 153 engaging the flat camming surface 169 of cam 162. In this way the input code disc can be rotated anticlockwise. This cam is mounted on an operating shaft 165 which carries a handle not shown . A series of equiangularly spaced radial slots 170 are provided around the input code disc, the slots extending to the periphery of the disc. Within each slot, there is provided a slider pin 172 each slider pin being held captive by means of the engagement of a central flange 173 on the pin with a cut out 175 in the code disc. The input code disc is located in position by means of an overlying guide ring 177 having a downturned flange 179 engaging the periphery of the code disc and closing the slots 170. As can be seen from Figure 4, the guide ring 177 is not continuous but has a circumferential gap 180 of approximately 250 angular extent. In this gap there is provided a funnel piece 174 pivotally mounted at 176 to the guide ring and provided with a finger 178 which engages either an inner circular camming surface 168 or an outer circular camming surface 166 depending on the sense of rotation of the handle. Movement of the handle clockwise as viewed in Figure 4 will leave the funnel piece 174 in the illustrated position and deposit a slider pin 172 at the inner extremity of its radial slot 170.Anticlockwise movement of the handle will displace the funnel piece radially outward through engagement of the finger 178 with outer camming surface 166, so causing a slider pin to be deposited at the outer extremity of the corresponding radial slot. Otherwise than in the circumferential gap 180, the slider pins 172 are held in either extremes of the respective radial slots by means of a downwardly directed annular flange 181 formed integrally with the guide ring 177. In this embodiment, the resident code disc 146 is of annular form being located in the end wall 183 of the lock housing by means of a flange 185. At the location of each radial slot of the input code disc, the resident code disc is provided with an aperture capable of receiving the end of a slider pin 172. The aperture is formed at the radius of either the inner extremity or the outer extremity of the radial slot 170, in accordance with the resident code. The guide ring 177 and consequently the input code disc 148 is centered in the housing by means of shoes 187 distributed about the periphery of the guide ring. The shoes are of C shaped section having flanges 189 above and beneath the guide ring. Disposed between the shoes 187 and the cylindrical housing wall 191, there is provided a ring 193 freely rotatable with respect to the lock housing and carrying a lobe 134 the purpose and function of which is identical to the lobe 34 in the first described embodiment. At the location of each shoe, there is provided in the ring 193 an inclined slot 195 seen best inFigure 6 . A pin 197, formed integrally with the guide ring 177, extends through this inclined slot 195 and through a corresponding vertical slot 199 in the housing wall. If an attempt is made to withdraw the deadbolt not shown the ring 193 will tend to be rotated through the engagement of linkage not shown with the lobe 134. Engagement between the inclined slots 195 and the pins 197 will then urge the shoes 187, and in turn the guide ring 177 and the input code disc 148, downwardly as viewed in Figure 5. Such downward movement will of course only be permitted if the correct input code has been entered with all slider pins in alignment with the corresponding apertures formed in the resident code disc. Rotational movement of the guide ring 177 is prevented through engagement of the pins 197 with the vertical slots 199 in the housing wall 191. This second embodiment has the advantage that the parts illustrated in Figures 4, 5 and 6 may be placed as a sub assembly in a lock case carrying the deadbolt and accompanying linkages.Interaction between the sub assembly and the lock case is minimal so facilitating assembly procedures. Other principal differences from the first described embodiment are the placing of the escapement drive within an annular input code disc so as to reduce the overall radial dimensions of the mechanism and the use of a fixed rather than a movable resident code disc. This illustrates that the relative movement between the code discs used to merge the slider pins with the pegs or other formations of the resident code disc can be achieved through movement of either one of the discs. A further embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to Figure7. In this embodiment, the form of the input code disc 248 and the manner in which the input code is entered through handle 260, cam 262, escapement drive 250, 252, 254 and funnel piece 274 is analagous to that of the first described embodiment and further detailed explanation is not required. The input code disc 248 is mounted for axial movement against the action of a compression spring 249. It will be appreciated that such axial movement will only be permitted if the input code represented by the position of slider pins 272 matches the resident code established by pegs 284 inserted in holes 282 formed directly in the lock housing 285. The cam 262 is provided with an integral bolt operating lever 263 which in the neutral position of the handle 260 overlies a transverse slot 265 in the deadbolt 214. With a correctly entered input code, handle 260 can be pushed inwardly to merge the slider pins 272 with the pegs 284 and to bring the bolt operating lever 263 into engagement with slot 265.Anticlockwise rotation of the handle 260 will then serve to withdraw the bolt. It will be noted that in this axial movement, of the handle, the operating lever 254 of the escapement drive comes out of engagement with the cam 262 so that the subsequent anticlockwise movement of the handle, which serves to withdraw the bolt, does not rotate the input code disc 248. In order to prevent spurious rotation of the input code disc during this period of disengagement, pawls 250 and 252 are elongated in the axial direction so as to remain constantly in engagement with the teeth 256. It will be appreciated that the lock of this embodiment is not of the deadbolt variety. Moreover, a handle 267 is provided on the opposite side of the lock to enable the bolt to be withdrawn without the need to enter an input code. It will be appreciated that by a modification similar to that illustrated inFigure 2, a lock could be produced which required the entry of an input code from either side. In a further modification, the lock of Figure 7 could be converted to a lock of the deadbolt variety. In such a modified lock, the initial movement of lever 263 would serve to release a bolt latching mechanism of suitable form, with further movement of the lever withdrawing the bolt. From the examples given, it will be recognised that locks according to the present invention can be produced in a variety of forms offering such characteristics for example deadbolt or not and free opening from one side as are provided in known forms of mortice or rim locks. In Figures 8, 9 and 10 there are illustrated alternative means of establishing a resident code in a lock according to the present invention. Referring to Figure 8, an annular raised portion 300 of the housing end wall 302 is provided with pairs of holes 304 in respective circular paths. Resident code pegs 306 are inserted from below into appropriate holes of each pair and are held in position by a ring plate 306 secured by means of a bayonet fitting 308 to the lock housing 302. This method of establishing a resident code is suitable, for example, for use with the lock illustrated in Figure 7, which is a rim lock. In order to change the resident code, it is necessary to remove the lock from the door enabling access to the ring plate 306. This is removed from the lock housing by a rotation which releases the bayonet fitting 308 and the resident code pegs are then rearranged. When the lock is reunited with the door, it is necessary to test the lock to secure the door.To close the door the bolt is first withdrawn. The bolt can now only be locked if the door handle can be pressed into engagement with the bolt and this requires the lock to be set in the new combination. Thus the user is obliged to test the new combination to lock the door, by entering the correct code. He then enters one or more false turns to secure the lock. A further method of establishing a resident code is illustrated in Figure 9 and is is suitable, for example, for use with a lock as described in Figures 4, 5 and 6. The resident code piece is formed as a removable plastics or metal card 350 having punched or otherwise formed apertures 352.The card has a cut out 354 enabling it to be slid into place around the operating shaft 165 and is held in place in the lock housing 356 by means of mounting lugs 358. Since the code plate 350 can only be removed when the lock is open, the resident code can only be changed by an authorised person. This form of lock would not be used where free entry was required from one door. This method of changing the resident code has the advantage that the user need only obtain a new code plate, manipulation of individual resident code pegs not being required. Referring now to Figure 10, a base plate 490 which is viewer from outside the lock, is provided with a cover plate 491 which can be slid aside to enter or change a code. A rotatable disc 492 is nested within the base plate and is capable of rotation about the lock axis. The disc includes radial grooves 495 at regular angular intervals and each groove houses a resident code pin 496. Facing the disc 492, the base plate is formed with barrier walls 497 and 498 through which the resident code pins are constrained to take one of three discrete radial positions.The inner and central radial positions correspond with the two possible positions of the input code members. The outer radial position takes the resident code pin out of possible engagement with the inlet code pin. Placing a resident code pin in the outer radial position is therefore equivalent to removing a code peg from the arrangement shown in Figure 7 or placing a double hole in an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 9. Underneath the cover plate 491, the base plate is provided with a key plate 499 through which a pointer can be inserted to vary the location of the resident code pins. By successive operations on the pins, a resident code of a desired length can be entered. Pins after the required code length are placed in the outer extremity of the radial grooves, as described. This method of changing the resident code has the advantage that the resident code pins are at all times captive in the mechanism and cannot therefore be misplaced. Moreover, there is no necessity to obtain fresh code plates such as with the arrangement described with reference to Figure 9. A final embodiment of this invention will be described with reference to Figure 11. An annular input code disc 500 is provided with a plurality of radial slots 502 which open to the inner periphery of the disc and with a like plurality of arcuate indentations 504 in the outer periphery. A spring roller 506 engages the arcuate indentations 504 to ensure that the input code disc can be rotated only in a stepwise fashion. The radial slots 502 each house a slider pin 508 movable between radially inner and outer positions. The slider pin of generally rectangular form having a wedge formation 510 on its upper surface and a domed abutment 512 on the lower surface. Beneath the input code disc 500 there is provided a fixed resident code disc 514 which is provided with apertures 516 in the same manner as illustrated in Figure 9. That is to say, at a particular location, an aperture is formed at either an inner or outer radius. The apertures 516 are positioned so as to receive the domed abutment 512 of a slider pin in either the inner or outer position of that slider pin relative to the input code disc. Outside the required code length, apertures may be formed at both the inner and outer locations in the resident code disc. It will be appreciated that as the input code disc 500 is rotated with respect to the fixed resident code disc 519, each slider pin will have its domed abutment received within an aperture or not depending upon the position of the slider pin and the relevant binary code element of the resident code. If the domed abutment is received within an aperture, the wedge formation 510 will lie flush with the upper surface of the input code disc if the domed abutment is not received within an aperture, the wedge formation will stand proud of the input code disc. Above the input code disc, there is provided a ring 518 retained at a fixed axial spacing and capable of relative rotation. The ring 518 incorporates a radial groove 520 above each of the slider pins such that relative rotation between the ring and the input code disc is possible only if the domed abutments 512 of all slider pins are received in aperatures of the resident code disc. At its inner periphery, the ring 518 is provided with a series of square teeth 522 The lock further comprises a handle 524 mounted on a shaft 526 and fixed for rotation with a lever plate 528. A bolt releasing lever 530 is mounted for free rotation about shaft 526 and engages at its free end within a slot 532 in the bolt 534. The lever plate comprises a first lever arm 536 which is of a length to engage a slider pin 508 in the radially inward position of that slider pin. The lever plate 528 further comprises a second lever arm 538 which carries a pin 540 engaging the bolt releasing lever and a sprung pawl 542 which engages the square teeth of ring 518. A third lever arm 544 provided on the lever plate is relatively short and engages one end of a slider 546 located in a slot 548 of the fixed resident code disc 514. The other end of the slider 546 engages the domed abutment 512 of the slider pin at the location of lever arm 536. At this location the resident code plate 514 supports a deflector 550 shaped so as on rotation of the input code disc to displace slider pins outwardly. The operation of this embodiment of this invention can now be understood. In the absence of a correct input code, an attempt to turn handle 524 anticlockwise to withdraw the bolt will cause pawl 542 to become jammed between the teeth of ring 518 and fixed pin 552. Relative rotation between the ring and the input code disc is prevented by the engagement of the wedge formation 510 on one or more slider pins within the shaped grooves 520. To enter the correct input code, handle 524 must be turned clockwise in the appropriate step pattern. The method in this embodiment of entering the input code is rather different from those of the previous embodiments where the required binary operations on the handle simply matched the binary value of the corresponding resident code element. In the present case, the resident and input codes remain of binary form but the handle operations required to enter the input code are not of a binary nature. If the handle is moved clockwise, lever arm 536 will engage the slider pin at the neutral location so causing the input code disc to rotate with the handle. During this rotation, each slider pin which is brought to the neutral position will be forced outwardly by deflector 550. The effect of a clockwise rotation through n steps will thus be to establish a sequence of n slider pins starting at the neutral position which are in the radially outward position. If the handle is then returned to the neutral position, the input code disc will remain fixed and as the handle reaches the neutral position shown in Figure 11 the action of short lever arm 544 on slider 546 will be to draw the slider pin then at the neutral position towards its radially inward location. The operation can then be repeated. The handle operations can be defined by a run length code such as 3 3 2 2 1 1 that is to say three clockwise movements, return to neutral position, three clockwise movements, return to neutral position, two clockwise movements return to neutral position, and so on. The effect of handle operations according to this run length code would be to establish an input code if 1 refers to a slider pin at the inner radial extreme and 0 to the outer extreme of 001001010111. If this matches the resident code with 1 then referring to an aperture at the inner radius and 0 to an aperture at the outer radius every slider pin will have its abutment received within an aperture and its wedge formation accordingly flush with the upper surface of the input code disc.If an attempt is then made to turn the handle anticlockwise, the ring 518 will be free to turn with the pawl 542 so that the bolt can be withdrawn. In a modification, the resident code disc of this embodiment can take the form illustrated in Figure 8. The described embodiments of this invention offer important advantages over known keyless locks. Since the resident code is in the form of a series of binary code elements, it can be changed without the services of a locksmith. The manner and circumstances under which the resident code can be changed are selected according to the particular application and a number of examples have been given. Since the binary code elements of the input code are entered sequentially and the code tested only after entry, it is not possible on entry of a particular code element to determine whether that code element is correct or incorrect. The lock is therefore extremely secure. By testing of the code is meant the relative movement in the preferred embodiment of resident and input code discs. With a handle having only two offset positions and one neutral position this being the preferred arrangement the further important advantages are achieved that no visual reference or accurate positioning of the handle is required.Operation by a blind or disabled person or by a gloved hand is quite feasible. There remains nonetheless an extremely large number of possible codes so that security is in no sense prejudiced by this simplification of the entry procedure. For example, with a binary code length of 20 there are 220 or in excess of 106 possible combinations. This invention has been described by way of examples only and a wide variety of modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the appended claims. Thus whilst the use of a handle rotatable in opposite senses to indicate binary values 0 and 1 is preferred, alternatives are possible. A lever could be employed or a handle which is pushed for binary value 0 and pulled for binary value 1. Yet further examples will suggest themselves to the skilled man of handle means manually actuable in either of two senses to indicate the value of a binary code element. The input code piece has been described as a disc possibly of annular form having input code members displaceable radially between positions corresponding with 0 and 1. In a modification, the input code members could be displaceable axially or circumferentially between positions corresponding with 0 and 1.Indeed, although circular orientation is regarded as particularly advantageous, a linear configuration is possible. Similarly, the input code could be stored by means other than individual code members displaceable between two positions, although again this is preferred. Fixed input code members could for example be employed, the orientation, deformation or other bivalued characteristic of which is indicative of the associated binary code element. The use of mechanical interference between unmatched input code members and resident code formations or pegs to prevent coaxial merging of input and resident code discs is a particularly attractive method of inhibiting opening of the lock in the absence of a correct input code. Other alternatives are possible however. Similarly, the use of a funnel piece or deflector to position input code members in accordance with handle movements is the preferred arrangement but others exist. A more direct connection between the handle and the input code member at the neutral position could be substituted, possibly similar to the slider of the last described embodiment. The necessary relative movement between the code setting member of whatever form and the input code members could be achieved otherwise than through the code setting handle movements. A separate handle might be employed or advantage taken of the energy in a bolt releasing movement, suitably stored.
