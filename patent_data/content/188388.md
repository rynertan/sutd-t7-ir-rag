# Alpha alumina particles, and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Alpha alumina consisting essentially of solid, spherical, non aggregated particles, having a diameter from 0.06 to 2 µm, a polydispersion index not greater than 2.0, a total porosity less than 0.3 cc g, a specific surface area from 0.7 to 80 m² g, and an apparent density of the particles from 3.2 to 3.94 g cm³. Such alpha alumina is prepared by a process wherein an alpha alumina precursor, having a water content from 2 to 35 by weight, at starting temperatures from room temperature to 850 C, having a particle diameter from 0.07 to 2.3 µm and a polydispersion index not greater than 2.0, is subjected to a heat treatment at temperatures ranging from 1130 to 170 C, the precursor being instantaneously brought from the starting temperature to the treatment temperature, and by carrying out the treatment during times, generally indicated in Figure 1 between straight lines a and b , which are sufficient to convert the precursor to the alpha phase, but not such as to cause disgregation and or aggrega tion the resulting product being then brought again to room temperature by means of a non instantaneous cooling of the order of at least 10 seconds.
