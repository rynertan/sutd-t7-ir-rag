# Electrolytic initiation of polymerization in aqueous two phase systems.

## Abstract
An indirect process for electrolytically initiating the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomer s comprises passing an electrical current through a two phase system comprising a an organic phase, b a continuous aqueous phase capable of carrying an electric current, c a free radical source capable of forming a polymerization initiator, and d an electron transfer agent. The process exhibits high polymerization rates and yields.
