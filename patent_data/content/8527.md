# Automatic presettable welding system.

## Abstract
An automatic presettable welding system which enables the user to preset the arc voltage and wire feed speed to precise predetermined values without either energizing the wire with arc voltage or initiating the wire feed. A meter A is supplied with an appropriate signal so the readout corres ponds to the desired wire feed speed or the desired arc vol tage and these same signals are supplied to wire feed speed or arc voltage comparative circuits C, E which then function to energize a wire feed motor B or an arc welding power source H to the precise wire feed speed or arc voltage indi cated on the meter. Means are provided for controlling the acceleration of the wire feed drive motor and a controlled initiation of the arc voltage at the beginning of each weld. Overload, overvoltage and undervoltage or over or under wire feed speed and other protective circuits G, F are pro vided with appropriate delays in the functioning thereof to ensure fully automatic and satisfactory welding.
