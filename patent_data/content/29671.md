# Electrostatic safety element for an electric initiator.

## Abstract
An electrostatic safety element within an electric initiator having the form of a disc 40 surrounding lead wires for preventing accidental ignition due to static electricity. It comprises a non conductive circular substrate 42 having a slotted opening 44 for the lead wires, and a conductive coating layer 46 on at least one face of the substrate to conduct electricity from the leads to the metallic initiator cas ing in the event of electrostatic discharge. This conductive layer 46 should be in electrical contact with the casing but not with the lead wires to that end the substrate 42 is left uncoated in the immediate vicinity of the opening 44 .
