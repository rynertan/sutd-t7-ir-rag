# SILICA BASE FOR DENTIFRICE AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION.

## Abstract
Silica base for dentifrice having excellent transparency and prolonged stability, desired abrasive ability, specific surface area of 270 to 500 m² g according to the BET method or 5 to 60 m² g according to the CTAB method , and a refractive index of 1.455 to 1.470 and showing, after baking at 1100 C, a substantially amorphous X ray diffraction pattern which can be prepared by reacting an alkali metal silicate solution with hydrochloric of sulfuric acid in the presence of an electrolyte, controlling the ratio of the rate of adding chloride or sulfate ion in a silica precipitating step in which the pH of the reaction system is up to 10.0 to that in an acidifying step in which the pH is adjusted to 3.5 or less at the completion of the reaction to at least 3 2, and completing the acidifying step within 30 minutes.
