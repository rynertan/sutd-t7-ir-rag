# Biopsy needle set.

## Abstract
In an end of suction type biopsy needle set containing double needle set of an outer needle 21 and an inner needle 28 , the outer needle 21 is narrowed to form a closely contacting portion A with the inner needle 28 , whereby negative pressure can be accumulated in a cylinder at the early stage of such suction, whilst thus accumulated nega tive pressure is transferred is transferred to an opening of the outer needle 21 at the moment when the withdrawn inner needle 28 is passed through the above described closely contacting portion A , so that such suction force sufficient for collecting the tissue section is produced. In this case, value function of the needle tip construction in the above biopsy needle set can realize relability of collecting the tissue sections. Furthermore suction can be in one handed operation by such construction that a plunger is provided with a knob projecting through the notched split formed on the cylinder.
