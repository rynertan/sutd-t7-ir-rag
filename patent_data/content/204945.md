## Abstract
This ski boot comprises a boot shell, a front gaiter and a rear gaiter associated therewith and a gaiter closure device. The gaiter closure device presents a lever element 4 pivoted, at one end, to either of the gaiters for rotation about the pivot axis between an open and a closed position. The lever ele ment supports an assembly for adjusting the working length of a cable 10 interconnecting the gaiters. The adjustment assembly has a slider 20 engageable with the cable and movable along a direction substantially perpendicular to the pivot axis 6 for adjusting the working length of the cable with the lever element 4 in the open position.
