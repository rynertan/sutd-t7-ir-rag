# ROLLING DIES AND METHOD OF FORMING THE SAME

## Abstract
The present invention provides an improved method of forming improved dies for rolling an article, such as a lock thread convolution. The dies are formed by rolling a circular hob along a flank of a thread form ridge on the die. As the hob is rolled along the thread form ridge, teeth on the hob are pressed against the thread form ridge with a constant force to form uniform indentations and or projections in the thread form ridge. The indentations and or projections which are formed in the thread form ridge by the hob all have the same configuration since the hob is pressed against the thread form ridge with a force of a constant magnitude as the hob is rolled along the thread form ridge. During the rolling of an external thread convolution on a bolt blank with the improved die, the indentations and or projec tions on the thread form ridge shape teeth on the flank of an external thread convolution on the bolt. Since the indenta tions and or projections were originally rolled into the thread formed ridges on the die with a circular hob and since the indentations and or projections on the die roll teeth on a circular bolt blank, the teeth formed on the flank of the external thread convolution have the same configura tion as the teeth on the hob.
