# Apparatus for separating particulate materials.

## Abstract
Particles having different properties e.g. particulate fly ash and carbon are separated by moving the particles forwards along a horizontal, gas permeable electrode plate 1 above which is mounted a second electrode 2 having at least one plate 4 mounted at an acute angle a to the horizontal. Preferably two plates 4 each extend sideways from a central block 3 of dielectric material. The particles are fluidized, continuously of intermittently, by a gas stream passed upwards through the plate 1 , which may be of sintered metal. An alternating electric field is generated between the electrodes 1, 2 by a high voltage AC power source 14 . The field lines 16 from each plate 4 curve to the side and impart centrifugal forces to particles charged by friction or conductive induction, which forces separate the lighter, more highly charged particles from the others. The particles may be moved by means of a vibratory transducer 12 . Alternatively, the gaspermeable plate may slope downwards in the forward direction allowing the fluidized particles to move in that direction under the force of gravity. The separated particles are collected in bins 13 arranged around the lower electrode 1 .
