# A protein having cell growth stimulating action, composition thereof and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A protein which is characterized by the following properties i having a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 160,000 when the value is obtained from a calibration curve showing a relationship between the molecular weight and the amount eluted obtained by means of high performance liquid chromatography using as marker proteins thioglobin with a molecular weight M.W. of 670,000 , bovine γ globulin with a M.W. of 158,000 fowl ovoalbumin with a M.W. of 44,000 , equine myoglobin with a M.W. of 17,000 , and vitamin B₁₂ with a M.W. of 1,350 ii composed predominantly of neutral and acidic amino acids and containing significant amounts of glutamic acid and aspartic acid as the acidic amino acids iii having a cell growth stimulating activity and iv being substantially free of nucleoside phosphotrans ferase, which is useful as a wound treatment agent and a promoting agent in the synthesis of DNA, and so forth.
