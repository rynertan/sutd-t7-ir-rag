## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns a novel system for weighing and loading freight cars coupled in motion. In many coal producing countries, there is an increasing tendency to carry large loads of coal long distances by rail. To keep this operation as efficient as possible, it is desirable to transport as much coal per freight car as is possible commensurate with keeping the loads within safe limits to avoid derailment problems. Freight costs are frequently based on the maximum load capacity of a given train. However, the shippers, for example, the coal mine owners, must be careful not to overload a freight car. Any costs involved due to delays in the train operations through overloaded freight cars are charged to the shipper. Such delays can be both very expensive and time consuming with the result that there is frequently a tendency for the shipper to underfill the freight cars to avoid the penalties associated with overloading. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a system for loading freight cars which will ensure that the freight cars are filled virtually te their maximum capacities, but will also avoid overloading. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system that accurately weighs the railway cars while they e e Coupled in motion during loading.For maximum accuracy full draft weighing of each railroad car is desirable, but has been found difficult to obtain with cars coupled in motion, because certain prior art full draft weighing systems have required a weigh platform that extends the entire length of the railroad car under consideration, but does not extend far enough to include a portion of an adjacent railroad car. Such a full draft weighing system is not available with respect to the weighing of cars coupled in motion wherein the cars have slightly variable lengths. It is thus a further object of the present invention to provide a system for weighing freight cars coupled in motion and coupled in motion during loading which can be modified to accurately weigh cars having slightly variable lengths. Another object of the present invention is to obtain a full draft weight of the railroad car under consideration during loading thereof, with the loading being terminated automatically when the car has reached a predeternined weight. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description proceeds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for weighing freight cars coupled in motion. The method comprises the steps of providing a neigh bridge having a plurality of mechanically separated sections, electrically discormecting the section bearing one OI more axles of a foreign freight car, and determining the weight of a freight car by taking into consideration only the weight on sections bearing the axles of the freight car being weighed. In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention a system is provided for weighing freight cars coupled in motion during loading. The system comprises an upstream weigh bridge having a length that is less than the distance between the rear axle of one car to be loaded and the front axle of the succeeding car and a downstream weigh bridge that is mechanically separated from the upstream weigh bridge. a loading chute overlies one of the weigh bridge for dispensing material to the freight cars for loading of the coupled freight cers during movement thereof. First means are provided for sensing the position of the freight car under consideration and for opening the chute to load the freight car under consideration. leans are provided for detecting the full draft weight of the freight car during loading taking the weight on the upstream weigh bridge into consideratior while axles of the car being loaded are on the upstream weigh bridge.Means are provided for closing the chute when the weight reaches a predetermined amount. Means arc provided for determining the weight of the loaded freight car after the freight car has left the upstream weigh bridge and taking on .y the freight on the downstream weigh bridge into consideration. In the illustrative embodiment, means are provided for sensing the potion of the freight car under consideration and for closing the chute to stop loading the freight car when the freight car reaches a predetermined location. Means are also provided for sensing a locomotive and for inhibiting operation of the loading chute during such locomotive sensing. In the illustrative embodiment, the first sensing means is operable to open the chute only after the first axle of the freight car has reached the doem stream weigh bridge. In a modified form of the invention, the down stream weigh bridge comprises a plurality of mechan ically separated weigh bridge sections. In this manner, the system is operable for full draft weighing of different size freight cars during loading. A more detailed explanation of the invention is provided in the following description and claims, and is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGLW 1 is a diagram of system for weighing freight cars coupled in motion during loading, in accordance with the principles of the presentQinvention, with the train being diagrammatically illustrated in a first position FIGURE 2 is similar to the FIGURE 1 diagram, but shoX7s the train in a second position FIGURE 3 is similar to the FIGURE 2 diagram, but shows the train in a third position FIGURE 4 is similar to the FIGUPE 3 diagram, but shouts the train in a fourth position FIGURE 5 is similar to the FIGURE 4. diagram,but shows the train in a fifth position and FIC URE 6 is a diagram of a system for weighing freight cars coupled in motion during loading according to a modified form of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED E BODLIENTS The system illustrated herein may be used in conjunction with a flood loading bunker system. To this end, a combination of weigh bridges are provided beneath a flood loading chute with the output signal from the weigh bridges, in combination with vehicle axle detection equipment, being used to control the opening and closing of the chute and to obtain accurate final weights, while the train is in motion. Referring no to the Figures, in FIGURE 1 a train is diagrammatically illustrated comprising a loccmotivc and 10, a first freight car 12 in the form, of a coal car a second freight car 14 also in she form of a coal car. A first weigh bridge WB1 is provided for obtaining the tare of empty weigh of the freight cars as the train moves from left to right, in other words, prior to loading. Two weigh bridges are utilized to obtain weight information for controlling the loading chute 18 and for obtaining accurate gross weights. These two weigh bridges are upstream weigh bridge WB2 and downstream weigh bridge WB3 which is mechanically separated from upstream weigh bridge WB2.Upstream weigh bridge WB2 and downstream weigh bridge WB3 are located adjacent each other so that both of the weigh bridges WB2 and WB3 can preferably be used to detect the weight of the freight car under consideration during loading thereof. The upstream weigh bridgeWB2 serves to provide an extra weigh bridge length for permitting an extra amount of roll during weighing of the freight car under consideration, but the weight on the upstream weigh bridge WB2 is not taken into consideration after the freight car is fully loaded and the weight of the loaded freight car is being determined. The operation of the system can be most easily understood by referring to the figures with the train being shown in different positions in succeeding figures. Thus in FIGURE 1, the last aSe 20 of locomotive 10 is on weigh bridge WB3 and the first axle 22 of freight car12 is passing between upstream weigh bridge JB2 and downstream weigh bridge WB3.While the sensing of the axle transitions from the upstream weigh bridge lE2 to the downstream weigh bridge WB3 may be utilized to sense the positions of the cars of the train, the use of strategically placed track stitches, as disclosed in Rogers U.S. latentNo. 3,374,844, may also be used to determine the type of car, number of axles, and position of the axles. Thus if the track circuitry on the weigh bridges lB2 and WB3 detects that a locomotive is passing over the weigh bridges, inhibit signals are provided via line 24 to weigh detector 26 which will inhibit detection of weight of the locomotive and will provide chute control signals via line 28 to inhibit opening of the chute. If desired, the wheel sensors may be connected directly via line 30 to the chute control for providing direct chute control inhibit signals to prevent the chute from opening while the locomotive is on the weigh bridges. Once first axle 22 of freight car 12 moves onto weigh bridge WB3, the front end of freight car 12 will be beneath the loading chute 18 and a signal from the wheel sensors will be provided via line 30 to the chute control to open the chute. As the train moves, the freight car 12 is flood loaded and no action is taken by the weighing equipment until the last de 20 of the locomotive 10 passes off weigh bridge WB3.Once th last axle 20 has passed off the weigh bridge, the combined output of weigh bridges WB2 and WB3 are used to detect a fully loaded condition of freight car 12, with allowance being made for coal in transit from the chute. Once this fully loaded condition is detected, the weight detector 26 which receives weight signals from the weigh bridges will provide a signal via line 28 to close the chute. If for some reason the fully loaded condition has not occurred prior to the last axle 32 of freight car 12 moving onto downstream we2 .gh bridge WB3, the transition cf the last axle 32 from upstream weigh bridge WB2 to downstream weigh bridge WB3 will provide a signal to close the chute automatically, to avoid spillage between freight cars Further, once axles 22 and 32 are scale borne on downstream weigh bridge I33, weigh detector 26 senses only the freight on downstream weigh bridge WB3 so as to provide the full draft weight of the loaded freight car. In FIGURE 1, the train is shown in a position wherein the first axle 22 of freight car 12 is moving from upstream weigh bridge WB2 to downstream weigh bridge WB3, thereby providing a signal for chute 18 to open. In FIGURE 2, the last axle 20 of the locomotive 10 is moving off downstream weigh bridge 1B3. onAxles 22 and 32 of freight car 12 are downstreas weigh bridge WB3 and upstream weight bridge WB2, respectively and weight detector 26 is operating to detect the full draft weight of freight car 12 during its loading.If freight car 12 becomes fully loaded to a predeter be mined weight, chute 18 will automatically closed. In FIGURE 3, the last axle 32 of freight car 12 is passing from upstream weigh bridge WB2 to downstream weigh bridge WB3. If chute 18 has not previously been closed as a result of a fully loaded freight car, the chute 18 will automatically be closed as a result of the transition of last axle 32 from weigh bridge WB2 to weigh bridge WB3. In FIGURE 4, both axles 22 and 32 of freight car 12 are on downstream weigh bridge WB3 and the freight car is fully loaded. A weight determination is made, using only the weight on downstream weigh bridge lR3 and excluding any weight on upstream weigh bridge WB2.The weight determination on downstream weigh bridge WB3 could be full draft or multi draft. In this manner, if the first axle 34 of freight car 14 were on upstream weigh bridge WB2 while both axles of freight car 12 were on downstream weigh bridgeWB3, the weight of axle 34 would not be taken into consideration during the weighing of freight car 12.On the other hand, by using upstream weigh bridge WB2 during loading of freight car 12, the weight of the freight car during loading can be determined with sufficient additional roll provided by the upstream weigh bridge WB2 to enable proper detection of the eight during loading. In FIGURE 5, the first axle 34 of freight car 14 is moving from upstream weigh bridge WB2 to dot stream weigh, bridge WB3 and thus a signal will be provided to open the chute to begin loading freight car 14. Freight car 14 will be loaded and weighed as previously described with respect to freight car 12. In summary, a split weigh bridge or an upstream weigh bridge and a downstream weigh bridge is provided. The freight car can be full draft weighed during loading and the problem of having a foreign axle on the upstream weigh bridge is obviated. To accomplish this result, the upstream weigh bridge has a length that is less than the distance between. the rear axle of a car to be loaded and the front axle of the succeeding car.Thus, once the front axle of the succeeding car foreigh axle is on the upstream weigh bridge, the rear axle of the car being loaded has left the upstream weigh bridge and the weight on the upstream weigh bridge is not taken into consideration. However, the upstream weigh bridge provides an extra roll length and the loading can operate during the time that the, axles are on both the upstream weigh bridge and the downstream weigh bridge whereby once the car is moved onto the downstream weigh bridge, the upstream weigh bridge is electrically and mechanically disconnected. In the modified form of the invention illustrated in FIGURE 6, the do nstream weigh bridge comprises a plurality cf mechanically separated weigh bridge sections WB4,WB5, WB6 and WB7. Thus upstream weigh bridge WB2 provides extra roll for the freight car being loaded. Upstream weigh bridge WB2 is mechanically and electrically disconnected once the car being loaded is moved onto the downstream weigh bridge. By providing a downstream weigh bridge having separated sections, freight cars having various lengths can be weighed with various sections being electrically and mechanically disconnected during weighing so that the axles of a foreign freight car will not be taken into consideration. Thus referring to FIGURE 6, freight car 38 includes first axle 40, second axle 41, third axle 47 and fourth axle 43.When second axle 41 enters downstream weigh bridge segment WB4 from upstream weigh bridge WB2, chute 18 is automatically opened to begin the leading operation. During loading, the weight of freight train 38 s axles on both the upstream and downstream weigh bridges ale taken into consideration while axles of the car being loaded are in the upstream weigh bridge. Once the weight has reached a predetermined amount, loading chute 18 is closed. A final weight of the loaded freight car 38 may then be taken. The final weight is not affected by first axle 46 of freight car 48 being on the upstream weigh bridge WB2. By using various lengths and combination of weigh bridges together with track circuitry to detect different types of freight cars, the loading of different types of freight cars may be monitored anS detected using the principles of this invention. Reference is made to Jones anci Hochberger U.S. PatentNo. 4,094,367 for a description of a system for full draft weighing of freight cars coupled in motion during loading, for an ezample of the locations of wheel sensors, for information relating to the adding of a preload compensation amount on the scales to compensate for the weight of material that trill continue through the chute until the chute is closed and for other pertinent circuitry. As a specific example although no limitation is intended, the weigh bridges illustrated in FIGURE 6 may have the following dimensions. tpstream weigh bridge WB2 may be 6 feet in length, downstream weigh bridge segment WB4 may be 12 feet in length, downstream weigh bridge segment lE5 may be separated from weigh bridge segment WB4 by 17 feet and be 12 feet in length, weigh bridge segment WB6 may be 6 feet in length and weigh bridge segment WB7 may be 6 feet in length. Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that various modifications and substitutions may be made without departing from the novel spirit and scope of the present invention.For example, the system may be used for weighing automotive trucks in addition to railroad cars. Thus the.term 1freight car is intended to encompass both railroad freight cars and automotive trucks.
