# Permanent magnet type motor.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet type motor having a stator 1 which comprises a yoke 4 , a plurality of main magnetic poles 2 made of permanent magnets, and a plurality of auxiliary magnetic poles 3 , each of the main magnetic poles 2 and each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 being juxtaposed on the inner peripheral surface of the yoke 4 , wherein each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 has an axial length Lp larger than the thickness La of an ar mature core and smaller than the axial length Lm of each of the main magnetic poles 2 , wherein each of the main magnetic poles 2 has an inner diameter Dp smaller than the inner diameter Ds of each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 , wherein each of the main poles 2 , before being secured on the yoke 4 , is machined to have the inner diameter Dp smaller than the predetermined inner dia meter by a thickness Î´ to be machined, and wherein each of the main magnetic poles is machined to have the predetermined inner diameter after it has been secured together with each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 onto the yoke 4 .
