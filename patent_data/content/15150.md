# Pipelines heated by skin effect current.

## Abstract
A pipeline to be laid underground or underwater over a very long distance e.g. 100 km, is heated by skin effect current employing an electric source frequency lower than commercial ones. The pipeline consists of a fluid transporting pipe 12 and a heat generating pipe 1 utilizing skin effect current SECT pipe . The SECT pipe consists of a ferromagnetic pipe 1 and an insulated electric wire 2 passed therethrough, and the pipeline is provided with an outer covering pipe 14 of ferromagnetic material so as to enclose the fluid transporting pipe 12 and the SECT pipe 1 . The outer covering pipe 14 is connected to the SECT pipe 1 and its thickness is such that an alternating current having leaked out of the SECT pipe substantially does not appear on the outside of the outer covering pipe 14 but flows only through its inner skin portion.
