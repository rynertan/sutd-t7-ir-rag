# Process for manufacturing lube base stocks.

## Abstract
Method for manufacturing a slate of lubricating base stocks 25, 26, 27, 38 from a paraffin base or mixed based crude 1 . Vacuum distillate fractions 4,5,6 are solvent dewaxed 24 while vacuum residuum 7 after desasphalta ton 8 is catalytically dewaxed 39 with a catalyst e.g. ZSM5. Before dewaxing vacuum distillate fractions 4,5,6 and desasphalted vacuum residuum 10 may be solvent extracted separately.
