# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FOR MULTIPLE CONNECTION OF LANDS ON CIRCUIT BOARDS

## Abstract
A high density electrical connector for use between semiconductor module boards 10, 20 . The connector body 211 comprises a relatively rigid member and a flexible member connected to it, which provides elastomeric contact pressure. The rigid and flexible members are embodied in a dual durometer rubber layers 71, 81 having a relatively high durometer layer for the rigid member 81 and a relatively low durometer layer for the flexible member 71 . The relatively low durometer layer 71 has circuit connector leads disposed on an additional flexible layer 90 on the side facing away from the relatively high durometer layer 81 . During the positioning of the electrical conductor into the relatively low durometer layer by pressing against a circuit board 10, 20 , a wiping action occurs to clean dust particles and other contaminants from the connector surface prior to forming an electrically conductive bond thereon.
