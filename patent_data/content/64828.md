# Radial flow cell.

## Abstract
A radial flow cell comprises two or more sets of inlet port groove dam 1, 2, 4, 6 devices for improving the efficiency of radial flows and an efficient filtration device consisting of a micropore membrane 9 and a steel screen support 17 of low retention volume. It is useful for aseptic and continuous in line filtration of heterogeneous mixture containing high concentrations of solids, especially those resulting from fermentation processes.
