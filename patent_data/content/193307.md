## Description
PROCESS FOR THE EXTRACTION OF METAL VALUES AND NOVEL METALEXTRACTANTS. This invention relates to a process for the extraction of metal values from aqueous solutions of metal salts, and in particular to a process for the extraction of metal values from aqueous solutions in the presence of halide anions. The use of solvent extraction techniques for the hydrometallurgical recovery of metal values from metal ores has been practised commercially for a number of years. For example copper may be recovered from oxide ores or from ore tailings by treating the crushed ore with sulphuric acid to give an aqueous solution of copper sulphate which is subsequently contacted with a solution in a water immiscible organic solvent of a metal extractant whereby the copper values are selectively extracted into the organic phase. The application of solvent extraction techniques to aqueous solutions containing halide anions however has presented numerous technical problems. For example copper bearing sulphur containing ores such as chalcopyrite may be leached using ferric chloride or cupric chloride solutions, but the solvent extraction of the resultant leach solutions presents formidable difficulties. The recovery of zinc by solvent extraction from halide containing solutions such as those derived from sulphur containing ores by chloride leaching has also been proposed See for example, G.M.Ritcey, B.H. Lucas and K.T. Price, Hydrometallurgy, 1982, 8, page 197 . However, known extractants for zinc for example organophosphorpus compounds such as tributyl phosphate generally show a poor efficiency of metal recovery and a poor selectivity for zinc over the iron present in such leach solutions. The present invention provides a process for the extraction of metal values from aqueous solutions containing halide or pseudohalide ions by the use of metal extractants whose several properties meet the stringent requirements imposed on the extractant by the system. According to the present invention there is provided a process for extracting metal values from aqueous solutions of metal salts containing halide or pseudo halide anions which comprises contacting the aqueous solution with a solution in a water immiscible organic solvent of a N substituted 1,3 diazole compound of formula EMI2.1 whereinR1 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted lower alkyl group or an optionally substituted vinyl group X and Y, which may be the same or different, are separately hydrogen, an optionally substituted hydrocarbon group a halogen, a nitro group, a cyano group or a carboxylic ester group, or where X and Y both together with the two carbon atoms joining them form an optionally substituted aromatic or aliphatic cyclic group andA is the group C O.OR2, C O.R2, S02R2 or C O.NR3R4 wherein R2 is a hydrocarbyl group containing from 5 to 36 carbon atoms and R3 and R4are separately hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group, R3 and R4 together containing from 5 to 36 alkyl carbon atoms. As diazole compounds which may be used in the present invention there may be mentioned benzimidazoles of formula EMI2.2 wherein Z represents n optional substituents Z and n is from 0 to 3 imidazoles of formula EMI3.1 and tetrahydrobenzimidazoles of formula EMI3.2 wherein Z n represents n substituents Z wherein n is from 0 to 3. Each Z and Z may separately be for example a hydrocarbyl group for example a lower alkyl group , halogen, a nitro group, a cyano group or a carboxylic ester group. In the tetrahydrobenzimidazole, it is preferred that Z if present is a hydrocarbyl group. The number, n, of substituents Z or Z is preferably 0, 1 or 2. R1 is preferably hydrogen, as we have found that such compounds generally have a suitable strength of ligand and a better selectivity for zinc over acid as will be discussed later . It is preferred that the total number of alkyl carbon atoms in all substituents of the diazole compound is from 9 to 30 and preferably from 14 to 30, since the solubility of the compound in suitable organic solvents may be undesirably low if the total number of saturated carbon atoms is less than 14, whilst the disengagement of the organic and aqueous phases during the solvent extraction may be undesirably slow if the total number of alkyl carbon atoms exceeds 30. x in the group A C O.OR2, S02R2 or C O.R2 may for example be an alkyl group, for example an octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl or octadecyl group or a higher alkyl group. R2 may for example be a cyclo alkyl group such as cyclohexyl. R2 may for example be an aryl, or more preferably alkylaryl or alkoxyaryl group. To achieve good solubility of the compound in preferred organic solvents, R2 is preferably a branched alkyl group or a mixture including an isomeric mixture of branched alkyl groups.Similarly, if R2 is an aralkyl or alkoxyaryl group, the alkyl portion of the group is preferably a branched alkyl group or a mixture including an isomeric mixture of branched alkyl groups. The preferred number of alkyl carbon atoms in the group R2 depends on the total number of alkyl carbon atoms in the other susbtituents of the diazole compound.For example if R1 is hydrogen or methyl and there is used a benzimidazole compound whose substituent s Z together contain either no alkyl carbon atoms or at most one alkyl carbon atom or there is used an imidazole whose substituents X and Y together contain either no alkyl carbon atoms or at most one alkyl carbon atom or there is used a tetrahydrobenzimidazole whose substituent s Z together contain either no alkyl carbon atoms or at most one alkyl carbon atom, then in each case it is preferred that R2 contains from 9 to 24 carbon atoms. Compounds for use in the present invention wherein A is the group C O . R2 may be prepared by acylation of the appropriate imidazole, benzimidazole or tetrahydrobenzimidazole using for example an acid chloride of formula R2 C O.G1. The acid chloride may itself be prepared by oxidation and chlorination of the alcohol R 2CH2OR. Compounds for use in the present invention wherein A is the group C O.OR2 may be prepared for example from the alcohol R2OH by treatment with phosgene to give the chloroformate compound R20 C O.C1 which may be reacted with the appropriate imidazole, benzimidazole or tetrahydrobenzimidazole to give the desired product. Compounds for use in the present invention wherein A is the group SO 2R2 may be prepared by treatment of the appropriate imidazole, benzimidazole or tetrahydrobenzimidazole with a hydrocarbyl sulphonyl chloride R2S02C1 which may be obtained from the corresponding sulphonic acid. Highly branched groups R2 may be usefully derived from branched alcohols prepared by the Guerbet and Aldol condensations.Such alcohols are characterised by branching at the position beta to the hydroxyl group and have the general formula EMI5.1 wherein R5 and R6 are both alkyl groups and R5 contains two fewer carbon atoms than R6. R5 and R6 may be straight chain or branched chain alkyl groups and may be isomeric mixtures of alkyl groups. A mixture of highly branched alcohols may be obtained by Guerbet orAldol condensations of mixtures of alcohols and aldehydes respectively. By way of Example, good solubility in preferred organic solvents is conferred on diazole compounds of formula i above wherein the group A is the group C O.OR2, C O.R2 or S02R2 and R2 is derived from commercial isooctadecanol prepared by the tldol dimerisation of commercial nonanol and believed to consist essentially of a mixture of geometrical isomers of the compound vi EMI5.2 It will be noted that using the reaction scheme proposed above, isooctadecanol C17H35. CH2OH as above for example gives rise to the group C O.Cl7H35 on acylation of the diazole with the acid chloride derived from the alcohol.This group has a high degree of branching at the position adjacent to the carbonyl function in the group C O.R2 In contrast, when the group C O.OR2 is prepared by the reaction of phosgene with the alcohol to form the chloroformate, isooctadecanol G O.OCl7E35.CHZOH as above for example gives rise to the group C O.CR2C17R35 in which the position adjacent to the carbonyl group is occupied by the CH2 group and the branching only occurs at the next adjacent carbon atom. We have found that compounds having a high degree of branching, and especially compounds having a high degree of branching at the position adjacent to the carbonyl function in the group A, show an improved resistance to hydrolysis under the stringent conditions employed in the solvent extraction process. Thus when A is C O.R2, the group R2 may, as noted above, be derived from the primary alcohol R2CH20H. Primary alcohols having a high degree of branching at the carbon atom adjacent to the CR20E group, for example alcohols such as the isooctadecyl alcohol of formula vi above, give rise to a highly branched group R2 adjacent to the carbonyl function and are especially preferred when A is of the formula C O.R2. As noted above, when A is of the formula C O.OR2, and is prepared by the reaction of the alcohol and phosgene to form the chloroformate, primary alcohols such as isooctadecanol having a high degree of branching at the carbon atom adjacent to the CH20H group give rise to a product in which the highly branched group is separated from the carbonyl function by the CH2 group. Whilst we have found that such products still have superior hydrolytic stability as compared with the corresponding unbranched compound, further improvements in hydrolytic stability may generally be obtained by using a secondary alcohol R2OR, for example 3,9 diethyl tridecan 6 ol as starting material. Such a secondary alcohol provides the branching in a position directly adjacent to the carbonyl function. The diazoles for use in the present invention wherein A is the group C O.NR3R5 may be prepared by conventional means, for example by treatment of the appropriate benzimidazole, imidazole or tetrahydrobenzimidazole with an alkyl isocyanate in the presence of a catalyst such as dibutyltin dilaurate. The amide group NR3R4 may be secondary R3 is hydrogen or tertiary. R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, may be groups of the type indicated above for R2. R3 and R4 taken together contain from 5 to 36 carbon atoms. Thus R3 may be for example a lower alkyl group, for example a methyl group, provided R4 is correspondingly larger. R3 and R4 taken together are preferably alkyl groups containing a total of from 15 to 36 carbon atoms. For tertiary amides sufficient solubility in preferred organic solvents nay generally be achieved if R3 and R4 are straight chain or branched chain alkyl groups. However for secondary amides R3 is hydrogen ,R4 is preferably a branched chain alkyl group. The process of the present invention may be applied to the extraction from aqueous solutions containing halide or pseudohalide ion of any metal capable of forming a stable halide or pseudohalide containing complex with the diazole compound in the water immiscible organic solvent. Examples of such metals include copper, cobalt, cadmium and zinc. The process of the present invention is especially suitable for the solvent extraction of copper and zinc from aqueous solution obtained by the halide or pseudohalide leaching of sulphur containing ores. In general, such ores contain both copper and zinc in relative proportions which vary from ore to ore. It is convenient to recover both copper and zinc in successive processing stages from the leach solutions.For example the copper may be recovered from the leach solution by solvent extraction and the raffinate from this process may be treated in a separate solvent extraction process for the recovery of zinc. The process of the present invention may be used to recover either copper or zinc, although the same diazole compound will not necessarily be used as the extractant in both cases. Alternatively, the process of the present invention may be used for example in the zinc extraction stage only and a different solvent extractant for example a solvent extractant disclosed inEuropean Patent Application 0 057 797 used in the copper extraction stage Alternatively again, the process of the present invention may be used for the extraction of copper and a different process used for the recovery of any other metals which it may be desired to extract from the feed. It will be appreciated that the process of the present invention may be incorporated into a wide variety of different methods for the overall recovery of metals from their ores or from other metal bearing sources. Details of these methods will vary depending on the metal concerned and the nature and composition of the leach solution. By way of example, an integrated prpcess which is especially suitable for leach solutions containing high levels of cupric ion is described in European Patent Application No o 507 797 The diazole compounds for use in the present invention are especially useful for the recovery of zinc which has hitherto proved to be very difficult to recover effectively by solvent extraction.Thus the compounds of the present invention have in general a high affinity for zinc, which in general is combined with an excellent selectivity for zinc over the iron which is inevitably present in the leach solution especially for example when ferric chloride is used as leachant However, even compounds which have a high affinity for zinc also retain a high affinity for copper and such reagents are not selective for zinc in the presence in high levels of copper. This is not a signjficant disadvantage in practice even when it is desired to recover zinc from a solution containing both copper and zinc since the recovery of zinc generally takes place after the bulk of copper has been removed, for example in a first solvent extraction stage. In fact, it is by no means essential for the zinc extractant to show any degree of selectivity over copper at all. Thus it is perfectly feasible to remove residual copper remaining in the raffiiate, for example by cementation using a metal such as zinc or iron, and to treat the resulting copper free aqueous solution by solvent extraction to recover the zinc. The zinc solvent extraction circuit may be similar in design to that proposed in European Patent Application 0 057 797 for the recovery of copper from halide containing solutions by solvent extraction. Thus for example in a circuit for the recovery of copper and zinc from the aqueous leach solution derived from the leaching of a sulphur containing ore with for example ferric chloride, the aqueous copper free raffinate from the copper solvent extraction cementation stage will contain zinc, iron and halide ion for example 35 gpl zinc, 70gpl iron, 3.7 M in chloride ion and containing 5gpl hydrochloric acid . This feed to the zinc circuit may be contacted with a solution of the extractant of the present invention in a water immiscible organic solvent into which the zinc is extracted.The loaded organic phase solution is contacted with an aqueous strip solution containing a reduced level of zinc and halide ion such that at least a proportion of the zinc transfers into the aqueous strip phase. The stripped organic phase is returned to extract more zinc, and the loaded aqueous strip solution is passed to a zinc recovery stage, typically an electrowinning stage. The electrowinning stage may produce metallic zinc and chlorine gas as described for example in Zinc Electrowinning from ChlorideElectrolyte by D.J. MacKinnon and J.M. Brannen Mining EngineeringApril 1982 page 409 which may be used to regenerate the ferric chloride leachant now reduced to ferrous ion . Alternatively an internal regneration of the leachant may take place in a split cell without the generation of free chlorine gas.The zinc and chloride ion depleted aqueous stream from the electrowinning stage is returned to the strip stage to act as the aqueous strip solution, thereby completing the zinc extraction circuit. The extraction process of the present invention may be represented by an equation such as the following EMI9.1 where M is a divalent metal ion such as copper or zinc. This equation is a grossly oversimplified representation of a very complex process and is not to be taken as in any way limiting the scope of the present invention, but it serves to illustrate the formation of a neutral organic phase complex of the divalent metal and the extractant L which is believed to predominate in the process of the present invention. The equation illustrates the reversible nature of the extraction, whereby the complex of the metal and the extractant in the organic phase can be stripped on contact with the aqueous solution from the electrowinning stage which is depleted in the metal and in the halide ion. A further property which is of importance for an extractant in the process of the present invention is the absence of significant protonation by the acidic leach liquor. Such protonation may be represented by an equation such as EMI10.1 where L is the extractant. Such protonation of the ligand carries hydrochloric acid into the organic phase and builds up an excessive.chloride ion concentration on the strip side. We have found that this problem is particularly acute for the extraction of zinc which is thought to promote the acid transfer. Preferred reagents of the present invention combine a high affinity for zinc with a low acid transfer into the organic phase. As illustrated by the Examples, the extractants of the present invention provide a range of properties so that the optimum extractant may be selected for a given leach solution. Thus for example, the extractants of Examples 3, 4, 10 and 11 are relatively poor extractants for zinc, and would be used in preference for the extraction of copper. Furthermore strong extractants such as that of Example 12 are used most effectively in removing copper or zinc from dilute solutions low in chloride ion concentration where the high affinity for the metal is of advantage. In solutions of higher concentration of acid and chloride ion, the ligand would tend to transfer an unacceptably high level of acid.In general we have found that an excellent balance of properties including ligand strength an low acid transfer, especially in the extraction of zinc may be obtained using benzimidazoles of formula ii wherein n is O and A is C O.OR2. Such compounds also generally show good solubility in preferred organic solvents, and superior hydrolytic stability relative to the other compounds of the invention. Examples of suitable water immiscible organic solvents are aliphatic, aromatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene, trichloroethane and trichloroethylene. Mixtures of solvents may be used. Especially preferred in conventional hydrometallurgical practice are mixed hydrocarbon solvents such as high boiling, high flash point petroleum fractions for example kerosene with varying aromatic content.In general, hydrocarbon solvents having a high aromatic content, for example AROMASOL H which consists essentially of a mixture of trimethylbenzenes and commercially available from Imperial ChemicalIndustries PLC AROMASOL is a trade mark or SOLVES SO 150 commercially available from Esso SOLVESSO is a trade mark , provide a higher solubility for the extractant and its metal complex, whilst kerosene having a relatively low aromatic content, for example ESCAID 100 which is a petroleum distillate comprising 20 aromatics, 56.6 paraffins and 23.4 naphthenes commercially available from ESSO ESCAID is a trade mark may in certain cases improve the hydrometallurgical performance of the extractant.Factors influencing the solubility of the extractant and its metal complex are complicated, but in general extractants having highly branched substituents and or an isomeric mixture of substituents have comparatively high solubility. The concentration of the extractant in the water immiscible organic solvent may be chosen to suit the particular leach solution to be treated. Typical values of extractant concentration in the organic phase are between about 0.1 to 2 Molar, and an especially convenient range is from 0.2 to 1.0Molar in the organic solvent. Certain diazoles for use in the present invention are novel compounds and the present invention includes such novel compounds. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.Example 1 l isooctadecanoylbenzimidazole was prepared as follows Commercial isooctadecanol was oxidised to the acid using potassium permanganate and converted to the acid chloride using thionyl chloride .
