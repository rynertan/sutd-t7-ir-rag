# Rapid visualization system for gel electrophoresis.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses that by using light photodevelopment to develop a metallic silver image of biopolymers, particularly nucleic acids and proteins sepa rated on polyacrylamide gels, it is possible to visualize protein and nucleic acid patterns within 10 minutes after electrophoretic separation. This photodevelopment method requires only two solutions a solution to fix the proteins, and a solution containing silver ions, which pro duces an image when exposed to light. This type of protein stain has achieved a sensitivity of about 0.5 ng of protein. DNA separated on polyacrylamide may also be visualized with this stain.
