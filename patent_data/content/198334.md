## Description
The invention relates to a water clarifier and sewage treatment device comprising a rectangular tank including a floor, a pair of side walls and a pair of end walls, spindles secured to the side walls, sprockets received on said spindles, a pair of chains meshing with the sprockets, a pair of which sprockets is connected by a drive shaft and driven by drive means while the other ones are idler sprockets, and a plurality of flight members secured to the chains for scraping the floor of the tank. Water and sewage treatment systems are well known. For more than 50 years, rectangular clarifiers rectangular concrete tanks have been used in the treatment and purification of sewage, sewer drain, and drinking water. They are used to remove those materials which are either not biodegradable or cannot be chemically treated during the water purification process. Typically, these clarifiers have been referred to as either primary 4 shaft systems or secondary clarifiers, 3 shaft systems . A primary clarifier removes 1 non biodegradable solids i.e. grit that precipitate to the bottom of the tank where they are collected, and 2 scum which is collected from the top surface of the water. A secondary clarifier removes the non biodegradable solids that precipitate to the bottom of the tank that have not been removed during primary clarification. This can be accomplished in the following manner Systems include motor driven sprockets which move two parallel chains which have flight members attached thereto. The flight members scrape the floor of rectangular clarifier tank in one direction, gathering all solid waste materials which have fallen to the floor of the tank and moving them to a cross collector located at one end of rectangular tank. The solids collected in the cross collector are then pumped to a location for additional treatment or final disposal. Both primary and secondary clarifiers perform this function. Primary systems perform an additional function. Waste materials which are not biodegradable and have specific gravity less than water i.e., soap or oils float to the top and sit on surface of water. This solution is commonly referred to as scum. 4 shaft systems have flights protruding half out of the water, running in the opposite direction from those flights moving solids on the bottom of tank , supported on return rails. The flights move in one direction on top surface of water and push this waste into an element called a scum collector, where these waste materials are removed to a location for additional treatment and final disposal. A number of different stages are generally used in the overall treatment system. Historically, all mechanical components in rectangular clarification systems were metallic, driving first grade redwood flights. These components typically consisted of steel drive and idler shafts connected to babitted steel wall bearings which are set in steel wall brackets. Steel chain to which wooden flights are attached are driven by steel sprockets. All return rails attaching rail brackets and floor rails are made from steel. Wear shoes have also been made from steel. The chemicals and oxygen used to treat the water and the general water environment cause severe corrosion of all steel components. It is common for the steel components to be porous, allowing grit and scale to pack in the surface of metal parts. The combined effects of these problems cause severely accelerated wear of all metallic components. Steel drive and steel idler shafts become permanently stuck in steel wall bearings and will not rotate, which causes system failures. Metallic parts are energy consuming and have a high weight. It is the object of the invention to create a water clarifier and sewage treatment device of the generic kind which is non corrosive and energy efficient and which has light weight, costs less to install or repair, and is superior in wear and performance. This object is obtained with the water clarifier and sewage treatment device of the generic kind in that according to the invention the drive shaft consists of telescoping tubular members made of plastic material and in that the spindles are plastic stub posts. In accordance with the present invention,the water and sewage treatment system comprises a rectangular tank in substantially all plastic parts including stub posts having spindles disposed on bearings. The stub posts are connected to sidewalls of the tank with spindles extending into drive shafts and sprockets. A drive shaft between two drive sprockets comprise telescoping members to facilitate assembly and disassembly of parts within the system.On sprockets two strands of chain are moved through the turning of drive shaft and free rotation of idler sprockets on stub posts. Advantageously, the drive shaft comprises three telescoping tubular plastic members including two end tubular members and an intermediate tubular member fitting into the end tubular members and connected therewith, which end tubular members extend through said pair of sprockets and are connected to move with said sprockets. The above mentioned three plastic members may consist of glass fibre reinforced tube sections. Preferably, each end tubular member is connected with the intermediate tube section by a plastic tube interlock key assembly comprising a locking bar extending through openings in the end tubular member and the intermediate tubular member and held in place by plastic fastening means. Further, a plastic shaft collar may be connected around the intermediate tubular member in contact with each end tubular member. It is convenient that each stub post for the sprockets driven by the drive shaft comprises a plastic main body secured to the side wall, a plastic shaft extending from the main body, a plastic sleeve secured to said plastic shaft, a plastic bearing element surrounding said plastic sleeve and plastic means for connecting the respective end tubular member of the drive shaft with said plastic bearing element and the sprocket to freely ride as a unit on tee plastic sleeve. The above mentioned plastic sleeve can be secured to said plastic shaft by means of non metallic set screws. Further, the said means for connecting the respective end tubular member of the drive shaft with said plastic bearing element can comprise a pin element. It is advantageous that each stub post for the idler sprockets comprises a plastic main body secured to the side wall, a plastic shaft extending from the main body, a plastic sleeve surrounding the plastic shaft and fixed thereto by a plastic pin, the idler sprocket being supported to rotate freely on said plastic sleeve. Conveniently track members mounted in the floor of the tank for engagement with the flight members, the flight members, the sprockets and the chains are plastic elements. Preferably, a bull sprocket driven by the chain of the drive means is mounted around the end tubular member of the drive shaft and fixed thereon by a key extending through the end tubular member and the plastic bearing element. The elements of the water clarifier and sewage treatment device according to the invention are made of non metallic material, such as plastics including polyamides as Nylon 6 which have high wear properties. The completely plastic sludge collection system is designed to eliminate corrosion problems and dramatically reduce installation and maintenance costs in rectangular water clarifier and sewage treatment settling tanks. The system according to the invention provides at least double the service life of conventional cast and malleable iron components. Engineered plastic chains, sprockets and scraper flights have proved to be the ideal replacements for metallic parts in hundreds of settling tank installations throughout the country. The system made of plastic products provides an entire sludge collection system that is totally integrated to yield maximum life and cost efficiency. In addition the system is made simpler by designing out the need for idler sprocket shafts in either new or retrofit installations. While prior art systems have included some non metallic products, the use of plastic collector chain drive and idler sprockets in combination with plastic stub shaft spindle and bearing assemblies and a tubular drive shaft assembly have not been used. The stub posts and drive shafts have had to be redesigned from their original metal counterparts when plastics, such as Nylon 6, are used. Made of high strength, light weight cast Nylon 6, the one piece stub shaft spindles are stud mounted to the tank walls at each sprocket location in place of cast iron wall bearing and shaft housings. Babitted or bronze bearings have been replaced with tubular cast nylon bearings secured to the spindles with a non metallic key. Free turning idler sprockets are held in place with a cast nylon retainer plate fastened to the stub shaft spindle with a stainless steel bolt, while drive sprockets are attached to their shafts with a keyway and key, and set screws. The drive shaft is made from specially formulated glass fiber reinforced polyester tube sections that telescope for easy assembly to the stub shaft spindles. Three sections are used for cross collector, and for primary and secondary tank drive assemblies. When expanded and slip fitted over the stub shaft spindle bearings, shaft sections are locked together with cast Nylon 6 interlocking key assembly and cast Nylon 6 shaft collars. The stub shaft spindles, bearings, drive shafts and rail components are all designed for use in conjunction with cast nylon drive and idler sprockets, reinforced nylon drive chain, molded reinforced polyester collector chain, pultruded fiberglass flights, and cast nylon wearshoes. Among the outstanding features of all these system components are their lightweight, strength and durability. Component for component, the plastic parts averaged at least 75 lighter than the iron or steel parts they are designed to replace. This reduced weight not only saves operating energy, but allows installation and regular periodic tank maintenance to be performed more quickly with less labor. For example, a standard 23 tooth, 565 mm pitch diameter cast nylon drive sprocket weighs approximately 16.8 kg, while a comparable cast iron or fabricated steel sprocket can weigh well over 50 kg. Thus one man can easily install or replace a plastic sprocket or bearing by himself without the aid of a crane or hoist. Chain installation and maintenance also requires a great deal less effort, since a 3 m section of reinforced polyester chain weighs just 6.3 kg compared with 26 kg for an equal length o steel or malleable iron chain. The various engineered plastic materials used to make the different sludge collector system components were selected on the basis of extensive laboratory research and evaluation of their performance in more severe applications. Among the principal criteria were resistance to water and chemicals commonly found in water and sewage treatment facilities, abrasion and corrosion resistance, tensile and impact strength, dimensional stability, and cost effectiveness. Cast nylon, long a cost saving workhorse in heavy duty wear applications such as elevator buckets for sewage wastewater grit removal, was found to be best suited on all counts for sprockets, shaft spindles and bearings, wear shoes and wear strips. This material, the polyamide Nylon 6, is noted for its superior strength, rigidity, toughness, low creep, and abrasion and chemical resistance. It also is the most dimensionally stable of all the castable nylons under high moisture conditions. Immersion in water not only enhances its self lubricity, but also improves its physical impact strength. The ability of Nylon 6 to be cast in large precision structural shapes permits the new stub shaft spindles to handle the full load of collector chain and flights moving at speeds up to 2.1 m min well above normal operation speed of 0.4 m min. The result is elimination of the need for heavy steel idler sprocket shafts. Plastic spindles also allow the use of lightweight, high torque tubular shaft sections for the head shaft sprocket drive assembly.
