# Method and system for securing postage printing transactions.

## Abstract
A postage meter includes printing 12 and account ing stations 14 , respectively interconnected through an insecure communications link 16 . Each time the meter is tripped, anumber generator 20 at the printing station 12 is activated to generate a number signal which is en crypted to provide an unpredictable result. The number signal is also transmitted to the accounting station 14 . At the accounting station 14 the postage to be printed is accounted for and the number signal is encrypted 34 to provide a reply signal. The reply signal is transmitted to the printing station 12 , where a comparator 42 com pares it with the encryption result generated at the print ing station 12 . An equality of the encryption result and the reply signal indicates that the postage to be printed has been accounted for. The printer ist then activated.
