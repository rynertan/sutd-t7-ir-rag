# Process for producing monocrystalline layer on insulator.

## Abstract
A process for producing a monocrystalline layer on an insulator, particularly in a semiconductor wafer adapted for use to produce large scale integrated circuits, comprising the steps of providing a nonmonocrystalline layer 5 on an insulator 4 and heating a region of the nonmonocrystalline layer by irradiating it from two heat sources 6a, 6b while moving the heat sources relative to the nonmonocrystalline layer, thereby locally melting and transforming the nonmonocrystalline layer to a monocrystal line layer 5c .
