# Continuity tester.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a continuity tester com prising a D.C. coupled amplifier for providing a voltage to a transducer through a voltage threshold means, an A.C. attenuator for providing positive feedback to the amplifier, a first resistor connected between the input and the output of the amplifier and a second resistor connected in series with the transducer between the input and the output of the amp lifier, the first and second resistors providing negative feed back to the amplifier, and means for connecting a circuit to be tested in parallel across the second resistor, whereby if the impedance of the test circuit is below a predetermined value, the amplifier becomes unstable and causes the transducer to produce a signal whose frequency is dependent on the impe dance of the test circuit.
