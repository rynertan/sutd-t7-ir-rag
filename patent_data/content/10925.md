# Spray or atomizing nozzle.

## Abstract
A spray or atomizing nozzle for any agricultural, in dustrial or other purpose, comprises a vortex chamber 8 , an outward flaring outlet orifice 12 and a movable spray control body 14 . The spray control body, in the non ope rative state of the nozzle, rests on the flaring rim of the outlet orifice, while in the operative state the spray control body, being impacted by the liquid issuing from the outlet orifice, is slightly lifted off the flaring rim of the outlet orifi ce, facilitates deflection of the impacting liquid outwards and produces a droplet spraying effect. Due to the negati ve pressure zone created in the vortex chamber, the spray control body is maintained floating in a position of equilib rium at a close distance from the orifice rim, whereby the droplet size spectrum of the spray is controlled.
