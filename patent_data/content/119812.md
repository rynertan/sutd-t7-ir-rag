## Description
This invention concerns an improved quick setting refractory composition for monolithic linings of metallurgical vessels such as the basic oxygen furnace BOF . BOF type steelmaking, primarily because of its ability to produce quality steel at reasonable cost, has experienced phenomenal growth since its inception about 30 years ago. In the ongoing attempt to minimize production costs, a major concern of BOF processors is the wearing of the refractory brick lining of the vessel and the resultant consumption of refractory material to replace the lining. Such approaches as improved brick formulations and better operational practices including gunning maintenance programs have reduced this consumption to about 3 to 5 pounds 1 36 2 27Kg of refractory per ton of steel produced. Further reduction, however, is still sought. Despite the trend in recent years toward replacement or repair of brick linings of metallurgical vessels with less expensive monolithic refractory linings, today s BOF vessels are still faced over the entire hot surface with refractory brick. The bricks, normally tar or resin bonded high magnesia, are predominantly laid by hand, with the vessels having a working lining of from about 18 to 36 inches 45 91cm and a backup or tank safety lining of from about 9 to 15 inches 22 5 37 5cm . Of particular interest is the upper or cone section of the BOF which is subjected to extremely corrosive and erosive conditions. It is therefore a primary objective of the present invention to provide a quick setting refractory composition which develops a monolithic layer suitable as the original refractory lining of BOF and other steelmaking vessels. Quick setting refractory compositions containing calcium oxide and glassy alkali metal polyphosphate are disclosed in such as U.S. Patents 3,304,187, 3,357,843 and 3,920,464, while refractory brick having a calcium silicophosphate bond are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,390,002 and 3,479,194. A spraying method purportedly permitting the development of thick monolithic refractory coatings is disclosed in published European Patent Application 0009021. Japanese Patent Publication 77,154,818 Chemical Abstracts Vol.89, No. 4, 1978, p.324 describes refractory mixes containing basic refractory, calcium oxide, phosphate, silica and silicon or ferrosilicon. American Ceramic Society Bulletin Vol.49, No. 7, 1970, p.652 657 discloses phosphate bonded magnesite refractory compositions including two and three component binder systems. United Kingdom Patent Specification 1149429 describes a refractory composition containing alkaline earth oxide, NaH₂PO₄ and a glassy alkali metal polyphosphate. U.S. Patent 3304186 discloses a refractory mixture of aggregate containing magnesia, pitch and a sodium polyphosphate bonding agent. It has now been found that by the proper selection of the bonding system, a monolithic refractory layer can be prepared which suitably replaces the entire brick lining of BOF and other steelmaking vessels. The present invention provides a quick setting refractory composition comprising a basic refractory aggregate, a water soluble glassy silicate, active calcium oxide and a glassy alkali metal polyphosphate, for application as a monolithic lining of a metallurgical vessel, characterized by the basic refractory aggregate being from 80 98 weight percent of the total composition, the glassy silicate being a water soluble alkali metal silicate of particle size of 1 millimeter or less having an alkali metal oxide to silicon dioxide molar ratio of from 0.25 to 2, with the glassy silicate being from 0.5 to 4 weight percent of the total composition, the active calcium oxide being from 0.5 to 3 weight percent of the total composition, the glassy alkali metal phosphate being from 1 to 5 weight percent of the total composition, the composition optionally containing one or more of chromic oxide, clay and carbon, the chromic oxide being up to 4 weight percent of the total composition, exclusive of any chromic oxide contained in the basic refractory aggregate, the clay being up to 6 weight percent of the total composition and the carbon being up to 6 weight percent of the total composition. Preferably, the basic refractory aggregate comprises magnesia, the glassy silicate is sodium silicate having a molar ratio of sodium oxide to silicon dioxide of about 0.5 and the calcium oxide is present in the form of calcium hydroxide, while the alkali metal polyphosphate is sodium hexametaphosphate, the chromic oxide is in the form of pulverized chrome ore, the clay is air floated ball clay and the carbon is in the form of gilsonite or carbon black. Especially preferred is a refractory composition which comprises about 83 weight percent magnesia, about 1 weight percent sodium silicate having a molar ratio of sodium oxide to silicon dioxide of about 0.5, about 1.5 weight percent calcium hydroxide, about 3.5 weight percent sodium hexametaphosphate, about 5 weight percent pulverized chrome ore, about 4 weight percent air floated ball clay, about 1 weight percent gilsonite and about 1 weight percent carbon black. Also contemplated is a method of forming a monolithic lining on a metallurgical vessel which comprises gunning onto at least a portion of the inside surface of the vessel an aqueous mixture of the refractory compositon, as is a refractory lining for a metallurgical vessel which comprises a monolithic layer of the refractory composition, particularly where the refractory lining is in the cone section of a basic oxygen furnace and consists of the monolithic layer. Further contemplated is a basic oxygen steelmaking furnace having a working lining, the improvement wherein the lining consists of a monolithic layer of rapid setting, preferably calcium silico phosphate bonded, basic refractory of at least about 12 inches 30cm thickness with a hot strength of at least about 50 psi 345KPa at 2000 F 1093 C and a linear shrinkage of no more than about 2.5 percent at 2900 F 1593 C . The refractory composition of the present invention, while generally suitable for preparing monolithic linings in substantially all metallurgical vessels, is especially applicable to the basic oxygen furnace BOF , particularly the upper or cone section of the furnace. Certain practical and technical considerations must be given to such use. The refractory composition should be safe to work with and should show good gunning characteristics. There should be minimal dusting and low rebound during application. The composition should have a rapid set, developing at least 30 percent of its green strength within 30 minutes of water addition, to permit continuous gunning of large cross sectional areas in forming linings to depths of greater than 30 inches 76cm without slumping. The resulting monolithic refractory layer should have a high degree of refractoriness as well as a suitable hot strength over a wide temperature range hot modulus of rupture, or HMR, of at least about 50 psi 345KPa , and preferably at least about 90 psi 621KPa , at 2000 The particulate basic refractory aggregate which comprises from about 80 to 98 weight percent of the refractory composition may be any basic refractory grain. This includes, but is not limited to, magnesia, deadburned dolomite, olivine, chrome ore, and stabilized calcia, alone or in any combination thereof. Magnesia is preferred. The aggregate particles include various combinations of fine and coarse fractions which are well established in the art for casting and gunning refractory compositions, typical particle size distributions being illustrated in the examples which follow. The refractory aggregate is present at an optimum level to provide the necessary high temperature durability, this level suitably being about 83 weight percent of the refractory composition with magnesia as the basic refractory. Particulate glassy silicate is present in the refractory composition in the amount of from about 0.5 to 4 weight percent. By particulate glassy silicate is meant a water soluble alkali metal silicate of particle size about 1 millimeter or less having an alkali metal oxide to silicon dioxide molar ratio of from about 0.25 to 2. The glassy silicate, when mixed with the calcium oxide in water, forms a calcium silicate at ambient conditions to assure the monolithic layer of a rapid development of high green strength. The silicate also acts as a sintering aid for high temperature strength of the layer. Silicate levels below about 0.5 percent will not provide sufficient green strength, while levels above about 4 percent significantly lower the refractoriness of the monolithic layer. Preferably the glassy silicate is sodium silicate having a molar ratio of sodium oxide to silicon dioxide of about 0.5 present in the refractory compositon at the level of about 1 weight percent. The glassy polyphosphate of the refractory composition has the general formula M The calcium oxide content of the refractory composition should range from about 0.5 to 3 height percent. Any material which provides calcium oxide reactive with the silicate and phosphate of the composition and which has a particle size of about 2 millimeters or less is acceptable. Such materials include lime, calcium hydroxide and cements. The calcium oxide reacts with the glassy silicate to give high green strength and set and also with the alkali metal polyphosphate to provide the quick setting mechanism, as discussed hereinbefore. Calcium oxide levels less than about 0.5 result in too slow a set and generate insufficient bond development, while amounts greater than about 3 percent set too quickly and lower the composition refractoriness. Preferably, the calcium oxide is present in the form of calcium hydroxide at a level of about 1.5 weight percent 1.1 percent calcium oxide of the refractory composition. The refractory composition optionally contains up to about 4 weight percent chromic oxide exclusive of any contained in the basic refractory aggregate. Although not required, the chromic oxide combines with the magnesia of the basic refractory aggregate to yield a magnesia chrome type spinel which provides high temperature strength as well as high refractoriness and improved slag and steel penetration resistance. Chromic oxide levels above about 4 percent offer little added improvement in this property. Preferably the chromic oxide is present in the form of pulverized chrome ore, 50 percent of which has a particle size of about 50 micrometers or less, present in the amount of about 5 height percent 2.1 height percent chromic oxide . The refractory composition may additionally contain up to about 6 height percent each of dry, particulate clay and carbon. The primary function of the clay is to provide adhesion during installation of the refractory layer, lower levels of the clay resulting in increased rebound and levels much above 6 percent reducing the refractoriness and hot strength of the resulting monolithic layer. While any clay may be used, the preferred clay is an air floated ball clay with the clay level at about 4 weight percent. The carbon serves to impart to the monolithic layer good spalling resistance, good deskulling characteristics, and nonwetting property with respect to molten slag and steel. The absence or minimal amount of the carbon tends to lower the spalling resistance, with the layer having an affinity for slag and steel adherence which creates additional deskulling problems. Levels of carbon much above 6 percent, however, provide greater pore volume for slag and steel penetration of the monolithic layer and also decrease the layer s hot strength. While many carbon based materials may be used, the carbon is preferably added as a combination of granular gilsonite and powdered carbon black, each at about 1 weight percent of the refractory composition. The unique combination of properties exhibited by the refractory composition and resulting monolithic refractory layer of the present invention, particularly the quick set to high green strength, suitable hot strength over a wide range of temperatures, and low linear shrinkage, is believed to be primarily the result of the novel calcium silico phosphate bond system formed from reaction of the calcium oxide, glassy silicate and glassy alkali metal polyphosphate of the composition during preparation of the monolithic layer. Since the monolithic layer can satisfactorily replace brick as the original lining of steelmaking vessels such as the BOF, certain advantages accrue to steelmakers by this replacement. Not only is the installation and maintenance of the monolithic layer much faster, it is also cheaper than conventional bricking of a BOF since both material and labor costs are less. This is particularly true with the relining of warped or out of round shells where laying brick into a properly keyed lining to give a sound construction is often nearly impossible. Use of the monolithic layer also eliminates brick joints which are prone to molten slag and steel penetration deskulling is therefore easier because of the lower penetration of the refractory layer. The monolith further eliminates the necessity of a safety brick lining. The following examples are merely illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the invention, the scope of which is defined by the appended claims. In these examples, unless otherwise indicated, temperatures are expressed in degrees F, compositions are in weight percent and hot modulus of rupture HMR values are in psi. All references to mesh size in the examples are based on the U.S. Sieve Series ASTM E 11 61 see Lange s Handbook of Chemistry, 11th Edition, Section 11, page 2 1973 . Quick setting refractories of the compositions indicated on Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples C1 to C3 of Table I were prepared and evaluated as follows Each refractory composition was tested in triplicate for hot modulus of rupture HMR using a Pereny Model MRK 3000 electrically heated HMR furnace equipped with two parallel 1 inch 2.54cm diameter alumina rails having their axes 4.7 inches 11.94cm apart and with a 4.5 inch 11.43cm wide hydraulically controlled alumina loading ram. Eight test bars were placed in the furnace, being centrally located perpendicularly across the rails. The furnace was heated to a test temperature of 2000 10 F 1093 5.6 C following ASTM procedure C 583 and held at that temperature for 3 hours. The bars were then broken at a loading rate of 0.05 inch 0.127cm ram travel per minute while maintaining the test temperature. The hot modulus of rupture HMR was calculated following ASTM procedure C 583. Each composition was also evaluated for linear change at 2900 F 1593 C . The 2 x 2 x 9 inch 5 x 5 x 22.5cm test bars were loaded in an oil fired down draft kiln, each bar being bedded on 0.5 inch 1.27cm of high purity magnesite. The kiln was heated to 2900 F 10 F 1593 5.6 C over a 5 hour period and held at that temperature for an additional 3 hours. The length of each bar was then measured and the linear shrinkage at 2900 C 1593 C calculated as the percentage reduction in the length of the bar at 2900 F 1593 C from the starting 9 inch 22.5cm bar length. In addition, each composition was tested for rapid setting to high green strength. Eight pounds 3 6Kg of the composition was dry blended and then mixed for 25 seconds with 9 weight percent water in a Hobart mechanical mixer. The wet mix was immediately rammed into plastic molds about 3 inches 7.5cm in internal diameter by 1 3 4 inches 4.4cm high. The molds were stripped from the casts following a 4 minute set period and the samples were tested for cold crushing strength CCS after one additional minute of air set total air set of 5 minutes , after air drying for 48 hours and after air drying for 24 hours followed by drying at 230 F 110 C for 24 hours. The testing was run on a Tinius Olsen compression tester 90,000 pound 41 tonne capacity at a compression load rate of 24 pounds 10.9Kg per minute until failure. Results of the HMR, linear change and green strength development for each of the eight compositions of the invention Examples 1 to 8 and the three comparative compositions Comparative Examples C1 to C3 are shown in Table I. These results clearly show the advantageous nature off the refractory composition of the present invention and the required presence of all three of the glassy silicate, calcium oxide and glassy alkali metal polyphosphate in the composition to insure a monolithic refractory having the desired combination of rapid set to high green strength, suitable hot strength and low linear shrinkage. The gunning characteristics of the refractory composition of Example 8 were determined by gunning panel tests. The gunning panel consisted of a 1 4 inch 6.3mm thick steel plate 24 inches 61cm square having 4, 15 inch 38mm long anchors on a 12 inch 30.5cm centerline and 5, 7 inch 17.8cm long anchors on a staggered 12 inch 30 5cm centerline. A 1000 pound 454Kg batch of the composition was dry blended and loaded into a batch type V 8 gun Quigley Co., Inc., New York, NY of 8 cubic foot 226.5 litres capacity. The composition was gunned thru 1 1 2 inch 3.8cm diameter hose using a water ring, a tank pressure of 30 psi 207KPa and a jet pressure of 50 psi 345KPa . The gunning panel was supported vertically and gunned from a distance of 4 to 5 feet 122 152cm building up layers until the gun was empty. The panel was then suspended with the monolithic layer face down to check the ability of the layer, which was about 22 inches 56cm thick, to resist separation from the panel. The layer was also subjected to direct impingement of a propane burner flame to check for popping or spalling. The layer neither slumped, popped or spalled during the testing. Subsequent trials gave similar results with layer thickness of over 30 inches 76.2cm . Similar results are realized with a particulate refractory composition containing 80 weight percent deadburned dolomite aggregate, 3 percent glassy silicate, 2 percent lime, 2 percent glassy alkali metal polyphosphate, 3 percent chromic oxide and 5 percent each clay and powdered carbon, or a particulate refractory composition of 94 weight percent magnesia aggregate, 0.5 each glassy silicate and lime, 1 percent each glassy alkali metal polyphosphate, chromic oxide and powdered carbon and 2 percent clay.
