# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
In a colour display tube comprising in an evacuated envelope an electron gun system of the in line type for generating three electron beams situated with their axes in one plane, in which the axis of the central beam coincides with the tube axis, which electron beams converge on a display screen provided on a wall of the envelope and in operating display tube are deflected over said display screen in two mutually perpendicular directions by means of a first and a second deflection field, the direction of the third deflection field being parallel to the said plane, said electron gun system comprising at its end curved field shapers 27, 28 for causing the rasters written on the display screen by the electron beams to coincide as much as possible, each field shapers comprising et least three plates 29, 30, 31, 32 of ferromagnetic material, said plates being situated symmetrically with respect to the said plane and the central beam axis, the curved field shapers facing the three beams with their concave sides, said field shapers making the edge field of the first deflection field to be pincushion shaped and in which, according to the invention, each field shaper comprises at least two plates situated side by side in the elongetion of each other and the slots 35, 36 between said plates on the side remote from the electron beams at a distance from the plates being overlapped by plates 33, 34, so that at least one magnetic shunt is formed in each field shaper for the second magnetic deflection field, the line deflection field is attenuated less and a field distur bance at the area of the electron beams is prevented.
