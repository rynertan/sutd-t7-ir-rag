# A mechanism for winding a flexible line in a close packed monolayer on a drum.

## Abstract
A mechanism for forming a closely packed monolayer of flexible line for a tape measure includes a drum 2 , a main spring not shown for rotating the drum to wind on the line and a line guide comprising pivoted together members 15 and 16 . The line guide is moved axially and radially with respect to the drum 2 by the tension in the line 5 acting on the grooved pulleys rotating about pivot points 18 and 19 . Tension is maintained in the line adjacent the drum and in the line guide by a brake 8 .
