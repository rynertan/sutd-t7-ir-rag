# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING USEFUL AUDIO FEEDBACK TO USERS OF ARC WELDING EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
The user of electric arc welding equipment 100, 273 275 is provided with audible feedback signals 107, 108, 109, 106, 109, 110 which provide useful information relating to the output current 271, 272 and voltage 271, 272 of the welder 100, 273 275 . An audio tone is generated 108 and is fre quency modulated by a signal 107 which corresponds to welder output voltage 271, 272 . The tone 108 is amplitude modulated 109 by a signal 106 corresponding to output current 271, 272 thus providing 110 the user with a synthes ized feedback signal having a voltage proportional pitch and current proportional volume. Additional modulation means 70, 80 are disclosed for introducing a current proportional warble component to said tone
