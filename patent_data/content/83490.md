# ROTARY VALVE FOR A POWER ASSISTED STEERING MECHANISM

## Abstract
The invention provides a closed centre rotary valve and a power assisted steering mechanism for a motor vehicle incorporating the rotary valve. The closed centre rotary valve comprises cooperating relatively rotatable sleeve and core members 1, 2 having cooperating axially extending grooves therein and means 3 relatively biassing said members 1, 2 towards a neutral position. Said grooves comprise at least one inlet groove 4 connectable to a source of fluid under pressure, a cylinder groove 7, 9 angularly spaced from said inlet groove 4 on each side thereof and connectable to opposite sides of double acting piston and cylinder means, and a return groove 11 in overlapping relation with each of said cylin der grooves 7, 9 in the neutral position of the valve and connectable to a reservoir for the fluid under pressure, said inlet groove 4 being closed from communication with the cylinder and return grooves 7, 9, 11 in the neutral position of the valve. The arrangement is such that on relative angu lar displacement of said member 1, 2 in either direction from the neutral position the inlet groove 4 is placed in communication with one of said cylinder grooves 7, 9 , said one cylinder groove and its associated return groove 11 move out of their overlapping relation to close communica tion therebetween, and the overlap between the other cylin der groove and its associated return groove 11 is increased.
