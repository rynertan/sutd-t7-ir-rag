# Ultrasonic transducer with a multiple folded piezoelectric polymer film.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic transducer includes a piezoelectric polym er film 14 folded as at least two layers and having electrodes on both the surfaces thereof. The ultrasonic transducer is responsive to a signal, applied across elec trodes, to produce an ultrasonic wave to be focused at one spot so that it is converted to an electric signal. In this ultrasonic transducer, a groove 24 or through holes 42 are formed on and along the folded area 22 of the piezoelectric polymer film.
