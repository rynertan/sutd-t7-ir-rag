# Apparatus and method for testing and verifying the timing logic of a cathode ray tube display.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for testing and verifying the timing logic of a cathode ray tube display in a data processing system. Apparatus associated with the CRT tests and verifies the vertical and horizontal synchronization and the logic associated with the character generator by counting the occurrences of a selected signal having a preestablished rate within a predetermined number of occurences of the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals and checking that such count is comprised between predetermined values thus assuring that synchronization signals occur at the required rate.
