# COATING FOR METALLIC SUBSTRATES, METHOD OF PRODUCTION AND USE OF THE COATING

## Abstract
A coating comprising aluminum and at least one of the transition metals of the groups IVB, VB and VIB are prepared comprising a unique microstructure which may be a solid solution of the transition metal in an aluminide matrix or a pseudo solid solution of the transition metal in an aluminum matrix. By means of special processes a super fine distribu tion of the transition metal within the matrix may be obtained in the form of a metastable pseudo solid solution even though thermodynamic considerations disfavour such fine distribu tions. The coating may, with advantage, be applied to superalloys and be heat treated together with the substrate in order to form a stable aluminide coating comprising tran sition metal dispersions in an aluminide matrix. One of the preferred manufacturing processes of such coatings is the electrodeposition thereof from non aqueous electrolytes.
