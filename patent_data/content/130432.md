# Apparatus for suspending a system clock when an initial error occurs.

## Abstract
An apparatus disposed within a computer system is disclosed for sensing the existence of an error occurring within a computer system and for suspending an internal system clock when a certain number of clock pulses are generated following the occurrence of the error. When the internal system clock is suspended, operation of the com puter system stops. In the preferred embodiment, the inter nal system clock is suspended when two 2 clock pulses are generated following the occurrence of the error. As a result, it is not necessary to wait until execution of the current instruction is complete before stopping the operation of the computer system. Therefore, other errors are not generated within the computer system as a result of the generation of the initial error.
