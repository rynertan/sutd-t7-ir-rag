# Electrocatalytic protective coating on lead or lead alloy electrodes.

## Abstract
An electrode body of lead or lead alloy is provided with an electrocatalytic coating comprising a catalyst finely dispersed in a matrix consisting of an insoluble, semi conducting polymer formed in situ on the electrode body. A solution comprising a catalyst precursor and an organic precursor for said insoluble, semi conducting poly mer is applied to the electrode body of lead or lead alloy, dried, and said precursors are thermally converted at a temperature below the melting point of the lead or lead alloy so as to provide said catalyst finely dispersed in a continuous matrix of said insoluble semi conducting polymer firmly adhering to the electrode body. The coated electrode can be used as an oxygen evolving anode operating at a potential well below that of convention al lead or lead alloy anodes currently used in processes for electrowinning metals.
