# Apparatus for spraying liquid.

## Abstract
Control of high voltage is effected using apparatus having a high impedance generator 1 , the output being connected to a first member 21 of low radius of curvature and a second member 16 . The two members 16, 21 are spaced apart by a gas gap so that when the voltage between them exceeds a threshold value corona discharge across the gap can occur. Such apparatus is particularly useful in controlling voltage and hence the size and size distribution of liquid droplets in electro static spraying apparatus.
