## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD OF WATER CURRENT TYPE TREATMENT FOR SLIMMING, BEAUTY AND HEALTH PROMOTION, AND .APPARATUS THERE FOR Technical Field The present invention relates to the technique of slimming and beauty treatment which has become a matter of great concern recently not only to young females but also to middle aged and older persons of both sexes and apparatus for carrying out the treatment. More particularly, the invention has been made in order to provide a very novel method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion which is effective in varied applications including not just a slimming and beauty treatment but also general health promotion, light training in sports, postpartum or convalescent rehabilitation and so forth, and an apparatus suited to carry out this treatment method.Background Art From old times the slimming and beauty treatment to maintain a well proportioned slim body has been a matter of greatest concern to all females. Particularly young females who are prone to corpulence must continue such laborious and pathetic efforts as jogging, jazz dances, aerobics or other hard exercise in addition to diet restriction. Most of such basic slimming treatments, however, are attended with great pains both physically and mentally and therefore the efforts are often given up halfway without producing desired results.Even if desired results are achieved in terms of slimming, such inconveniences are often encountered as development of a rough skin or injury to health owing to an ill balance of nutrition, and adverse influences on mental hygiene. Furthermore, the practice imposes a heavy burden upon the heart and could be very dangerous to frail persons. In recent years not only females but many busy middle aged or older businessmen also tend to become corpulent from lack of excersie and supernutrition. The slimming treatment has become a matter of great concern to the people of such bracket not only because this corpulence, as is well known, causes adult diseases but because of the awareness that in Europe and America corpulence has come to be socially regarded as a problem so much so that fat businessmen, for whatever reason, are barred from top positions. For the people of that bracket, not only because the basic slimming treatments such as diet restriction and exercises as described above are attended with great pains both physically and mentally but also because these people are very busy, it is even more difficult to perform the practice continuously. In view of the above situation, the following varied new treatments as distinct from the foregoing basic slimming treatments have been proposed very recently and have already been practised at private beauty salons and clinics a Praffin Packing ... Paraffin is applied to the waist, thighs and other parts of the body to promote perspiration. b Massaging ... The waist, thighs and other parts of the body are massaged well to take off the stiffness of the fat and promote decomposition and discharge catabolism thereof. c Fat Pickout ... The waist, thighs and other parts of the body are massaged well using a special enzyme to take off the stiffness of the fat and promote its catabolism. d Infrared Irradiation ... A remote infrared beam is irradiated on the waist, thighs and other part of the body to promote perspiration and catabolism of the fat. e Ion Projection ... An ion beam is projected onto the waist, thighs and other parts of the body to promote catabolism of the fat. f Ultrasonic Projection ... Ultrasonic wave is projected onto the waist, thighs and other parts of the body to promote catabolism of the fat. g Hot Air Jetting ... A hot air jet is applied to the waist, thighs and other parts of the body to promote perspiration and catabolism of the fat by means of the heat and vibrations. h Low Frequency Vibration ... Electrically generated low frequency vibrations are applied to the waist, thighs and other parts of the body to cause artificial muscular motions and promote perspiration and consumption of the fat. i Lymph Gland Stimulation ... Massaging or other means is applied to stimulate lymph glands and promote secretion of lymph thereby to promote catabolism of the fat. However, in all of the foregoing conventional methods, a treated person lies on a bed beside a trainer in charge of the treatment and has only certain parts of his or her body massaged, applied with a quasi drug substance, or mechanically or electrically stimulated by means of an implement. It may be pointed out, therefore, that the treated person could possibly lapse into a psychological state as if he or she were being cured of a disease or feel uneasy about side effects or other harmful influences. Furthermore, these conventional methods invariably seem to produce a considerable effect as regards slimming but do not seem very helpful for health promotion or an increase in physical strength.Further still, since at least one trainer must attend on one treated person all the time in a man to man treatment, the conventional methods have the drawback of being very inefficient and therefore involving a very high treatment cost. In addition, such conventional methods are extremely embarrassing to people like middleaged businessmen, and are very difficult for them to practise because of the psychological recoil. The present invention has been made in view of such an actual situation and on the basis of a very original idea and results of many experimental surveys and researches carried out to ascertain its practical effect. The object of this invention is to provide a totally novel and very effective method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion and an apparatus for carrying out the method in a convenient and desirable manner. Such method and apparatus assure excellent results in health promotion, increase of physical strength and various other aspects, not to mention the slimming and beauty treatment which is of primary concern, without causing any excessive burden on the heart or any harmful influence such as a side effect and without causing any psychological effect or uneasy feeling.Such method and apparatus are readily available to anyone and yet place very little burden on trainers or instructors, and are also very economical.Disclosure of Invention In order to achieve the above object, the invention proposes, as a first aspect of the invention, a method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion comprising generating a water current around a treated person positioned in a treating bath to have a flow rate in a direction perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to his or her lengthwise direction, and applying the water current directly and continuously to the treated person. Further, the invention proposes, as a second aspect of the invention to carry out the method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion, a water current type apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion comprising a treating bath adapted to accommodate at least one treated person, and a water current generating mechanism for generating in the treating bath a water current having a flow rate in a direction perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to a lengthwise direction of the treated person to be positioned in the treating bath. The above method of the first aspect of the invention and the apparatus of the second aspect of the invention have the following funcitons and effects First, an explanation will be given of results of a basic experiment carried out employing the method of the first aspect of the invention having the above characterizing steps and of questionairing put to subjects persons experimented on. These basic experiment and questionairing were and still are carried out at an experimental water current circulation tank of Kabushiki Kaisha Nishi Hippon RyutaiGiken West Japan Fluid Engineering Laboratory Co.,Ltd. . An outline of results obtained about one month from the start of the experiment will be described first. I Outline of Experimental Facilities The experiment was carried out using a vertical circulation type water tank designed for shipping performance tests as shown in Fig. 2. This circulation tank comprises a circulation passage Bo mounted in a vertical direction on bocks Ao upstanding from the ground. A downstream passage duct portion of the circulation passage Bo includes therein a right and left pair of flow rate generating impellers Co, and a horizontal upstream passage portion defines a measuring section Eo length x width x water depth 5.3 m x 2.0 m x 1.0 to 1.5 m having a free water surface and a square cross section. This measuring section Eo has transparent observation windows Fo on a bottom wall and right and left lateral walls, respectively.The circulation passage Bo further includes rectifying devices and flow rate uniformalizing devices such as corner vanes Go, a punched metal sheet Ho and a honeycomb plate Io arranged at appropriate positions, and a surface flow acceleratorJo mounted at a position immediately upstream of the measuring section Eo, thereby to produce a constant, linear current flowing at a highly uniformalized flow rate through the measuring section Eo. The flow rate of the linear current flowing through the measuring sectionEo is adjusted as necessary, while retaining its constancy, between a minimum flow rate of about 0.05 m sec and a maximum flow rate of about 2.0 m sec by adjusting rotational rate of electromotors Ko for driving the right and left pair of flow rate generating impellersCo. Reference Lo denotes foam eliminating devices. While the measuring section Eo is constantly partitioned at a position upstream thereof by the honeycomb plate Io as described, an extreme downstream portion thereof is normally in an open state and its interior includes nothing except a subject to be tested in a normal situation for carrying out a precision hydromechanical test such as a shipping performace test.However, for carrying out the present experiment, the measuring section includes an inclined porous plate Mo at an extreme downstream position thereof, which is inclined with an upper portion thereof positioned progressively toward a downstream side, to prevent persons to be positioned in the measuring section Eo as subjects to be experimented on from being washed away while permitting passage of the water current and also to serve as a back support for the subject persons, as shown in the plan view and vertical section view of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.Furthermore, the measuring section Eo includes a stair No at a lateral side thereof to allow the subject persons to walk up and down, and a stationary bar Qo at an upper forward portion thereof for the subject persons to hold on to directly or for attaching straps Oo for the subject persons to hold on to and belts Po for supporting the waists of the subject persons. II Outline of Persons Experimented On Three females were asked to be subjects for experiment or to be treated persons for trial purposes hereinafter referred to as subject X1, subject X2 and subject X3 . For this experiment relatively young females not conspicuously tending to be corpulent were chosen as subjects X1, X2 and X3, but since then further experiments are being conducted also choosing older and more corpulent persons as subjects. Statistics of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 prior to the experiment are shown on the next page. 1 Subject X1 Age 18, healthy Height 159.0 cm Weight 62.5 kg Waist 71.0 cm Thigh 60.0 cm 2 Subject X2 Age 19, healthy Height 154.0 cm Weight 57.6 kg Waist 68.0 cm Thigh 58.6 cm 3 Subject X3 Age 34, healthy Height 155.0 cm Weight 54.5 kg Waist 70.0 cm Thigh 51.0 cm Of these three subjects X1, X2 and X3, subject X3 is an expert on physical training physiology, and the experiment was conducted such that subject X3 gave instructions to the other subjects X1 and X2 while being experimented on herself. III Method of Experiment First, prior to the experiment, health conditions of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 are checked by verbally confirming as to whether they feel well and measuring their blood pressures, and their weights are measured and recorded. The waist and thigh are to be measured and recorded every week or so. The experiment is off on holidays. Next, a water current controlled to have a predetermined flow rate is generated in the measuring section Eo of the circulation tank corresponding to the treating bath of the present invention, and the three subjects X1, X2 and X3 simultaneously place themselves in the water current in a standing posture or an approximately standing posture in the measuring sectionEo. Each person is asked to remain facing the upstream side continuously for a predetermined time without being washed away by holding the strap Oo or the stationary bar Qo or using the belt Po secured to the stationary bar Qo to support her waist, or else to lean against the inclined porous plate Mo. In other words, a training is effected for the predetermined time in which water current massages are applied to the entire body regions of the subjects from the neck down. After the water current massages the subjects X1,X2 and X3 leave the treating bath or the measuring section Eo to be checked of the health condition such as by blood pressure measurement. Also each of the subjectsX1, X2 and X3 is asked how she feels and other matters she noticed, which are recorded. While in this experiment the subjects were asked to remain receiving the water current from the forward direction only, further experiments are continuing in which many kinds of variations are included, for example, turning the facing diction to receive the water current on a side or the back of the body, or lifting a foot, flexing the knees and varied other motions It is to be noted that no diet restriction or other slimming treatments are employed during the period of this experiment. IV Conditions of Experiment 1 Period of Experiment ... one month Aug. Sep. 2 Frequency of Experiment ... once a day 3 Experiment Time ... on average 30 min. at a time. However, considering fatigue of the subjects because of lack of experience, the experiment was terminated in a relatively short time at first and was extended as the days passed. 4 Water Temperature ... normal 29 degrees centigrade 5 Flow Rate ... 0.6 1.6 m sec. However, considering fatigue of the subjects because of lack of experience, the flow rate was made low at the beginning of the experiment and was increased with the lapse of time, and a relatively low flow rate was provided during early stages of the experiment which was increased as the days passed. V Results of Experiment 1 Results of Observations by Eye The conditions of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 were observed through the lateral observation windows F of the treating bath or the measuring section E , and the following outstanding phenomena were noted i When the flow rate is increased to about 1.0 m sec or higher, each of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 is clearly seen to be trying hard not to be washed away by the water current. This shows that the kinetic energy of the water current acting on the subjects produces a greater exercise effect than expected on the subjects tying to withstand it. size When the flow rate is increased to about 1.2 m sec or higher, flabby parts on sides of the waist and thighs of each of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 are deformed by the water current to protrude rearwardly or become creased. In other words, the subcutaneous fat layers formed of soft tissue compared with muscles, when subjected to a relatively strong water current, shows what is called the fluttering phenomenon as in the case of a flag waving in the wind. This proves that the water current acting directly on body surfaces of the subjects produces a greater massaging effect than expected on the body surfaces of the subjects, and that advantageously the massaging effect is applied in a natural and concentrated manner to the fatty parts such as the waist, thighs and buttocks. 2 Measurement Results Next, graphs showing measurements of the weight, waist and thigh of the respective subjects X1, X2 and X3 taken during the experiment period noted above one month as a time history are depicted in Fig. 5 a , b c . From these graphs it will be seen that all of the subjects X1, X2 and X3 lost weight and the measurements of the waist and thighs in a steady manner as the days passed. The standard values shown in double dots and dash lines in the drawings are derived from the following formulas A Weight and Thigh height 100 x 0.9 B Waist height 100 x 1.1The total losses in the weight, waist and thigh of the respective subjects X1, X2 and X3 during the one month from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment are as follows 1 Subject X1 Loss in Weight 62.5 58.8 3.7 kg Loss in Waist 71.0 65.4 5.6 cm Loss in Thigh 60.0 56.2 3.8 cm 2 Subject X2 Loss in Weight 57.6 53.1 s 4.5 kg Loss in Waist 68.0 61.8 t 6.2 cm Loss in Thigh 58.6 53.6 5.0 cm 3 Subject X3 Loss in Weight 54.5 53.0 1.5 kq Loss in Waist 70.0 66.5 3.5 cm Loss in Thigh 51.0 49.0 2.0 cm It is seen from these results that there is an outstanding feature that all of the subjects X1, X2 andX3 have. lost significant amounts in the waist and thighs compared with the losses in the weight. This proves that the method according to the present invention assures not only a slimming effect but, in a more excellent way, a body. shaping effect. VI Results of Questionairing Some noteworthy matters obtained through questioning the subjects X1, X2 and X3 their impressions and other things they had or felt during the present experiment are listed hereunder. a The forces of the water current are greater than expected and an actual feeling of having come through an intensive exercise remains after the experiment. However, hardly any pain or fatigue was felt during or after the experiment. b It was very pleasant to receive the relatively strong water current directly on the body and to receive the massaging by the water current. c It gave a very easy and relaxed feeling since it involved no touching by other people, no electric or mechanical stimulation applied directly to the body, and no application of a drug as in the other slimmming treatments. d Appetite has rather increased than decreased since the participation in the experiment, but even so no fattening occured to their relief. e Some days have passed since the end of the experiment, but there is no sign of return to the previous weight, waist or thigh. The constitutional tendency to become corpulent may have been improved. f It was like playing in the water and got rid of stress. g It may well be applicable for rehabilitation or the like of people just recovered from an illness or physically handicapped people, for example, by suitably adjusting the flow rate. h Since one unit of the experiment training requires a relatively short time, little restriction occurs with regard to the physical strength or schedule. i The experiment was performed in a free and easy way since only minimal instructions were given by the trainer subject X3 , j Since the training was taken together with other people, it was enjoyable chatting away the hours.But it may be better to do it alone sometimes. k The health condition has improved and the physical strength has increased. 1 The tendency for insomnia has been cured and a good sleep is taken now. m The tendency for constipation has been cured and a regular motion of the bowels takes place now. n A stiff shoulder has been cured giving a very relaxed feeling. o The blood pressure has come closer to a normal value. p The skin has improved with added life and smoothness. The results of the basic experiment and the results of the questionairing as noted above have proved that the first aspect of the present invention is adapted to provide a method of water current type slimming, beauty and health promotion assuring excellent results in health control health promotion, increase of physical strength, elimination of mental stress and so forth , rehabilitation of convalescent or physically handicapped persons and various other aspects, not to mention the slimming and beauty treatment which is of primary concern, without causing any excessive burden on the heart or any harmful influence such as a side effect or development of a rough skin, without causing any psychological effect or uneasy feeling. Such method is readily available to anyone and yet places very little burden on trainers or instructors, and are also very economical.Thus, the apparatus according to the second aspect of the present invention having the already described characterizing features, namely the water current type apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion adapted exclusively for carrying out the method according to the first aspect of the present invention in a very convenient and desirable manner, has been developed. A further training experiment has been carried out using the water current type apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion and selecting people of varied ages and degrees of corpulence to be subjects for the experiment. Results obtained from this experiment are shown in the proportion graphs of Fig. 6 a e . These proportion graphs have been prepared assuming that an ideal proportion is represented by a regular pentagon. It will readily be understood from these experiment results that excellent slimming and beauty promotion are achieved only by continuing a very short training 30 to 45 minutes over a very short period about one month regardless of the age and the degree of corpulence and without employing any other treatment at the same time such as diet restriction, jogging or the like. What is most noteworthy is the findings that there occurs no return to corpulence, or rather the slimming tendency continues, without making special slimming efforts after this training experiment.In contemplating the reasons for such an apparently inexplicable phenomenon, it seems that, in the course of this water current massaging type slimming and beauty training, the fat discharging funciton of the living body per se is improved and the improved funciton is retained by the living body to keep performing the fat discharging function even after the training.In other words, this method of water current massaging type slimming and beauty treatment may be said to have its most salient characteristics in that, unlike the other, conventional methods which try to remove the fat forcibly in a single attempt, a relatively mild stimulation. in the form of water current massaging is employed the water current is applied to the layers of fat to cause repeated deformations through the fluttering phenomenon to take off the stiffness of the fat to arouse the surplus fat discharging function that the living body has by nature and to strengthen that function whereby the fat is discharged by the living body per se. It is to be noted that Fig. 6 e shows results of checking influences where this water current massaging type slimming and beauty training is applied to a person originally having a good proportion.As seen, the training has made her slimmer as a whole but her originally beautiful proportion has not been affected. It is to be noted in addition that, although the experiment results noted hereinbefore are all derived from female subjects, excellent results may also be obtained from male subjects according to a recent experiment, and that more detailed and positive studies are being carried out to establish a physiological and medical confirmation of the various effects produced by the present method and apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion.Brief Description of Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic side view in vertical section of a treating bath for illustrating the basic concept of the method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion according to a first aspect of the present invention, Fig. 2 is a schematic overall side view, partly in section, of a circulation tank for hydromechanical testing used in a basic experiment for inspecting the functional effect of the method according to the present invention, Fig. 3 is a plan view of a principal portion in the experimental application, Fig. 4 is a side view in vertical section of the principal portion in the experimental application,Fig. 5 a , b , c show graphs of results of the basic experiment, and Fig. 6 a , b , c , d , e show graphs of results of a further experiment, respectively.

First, basic steps of the method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion according to the first aspect of the present invention will be described. As shown in Fig. 1, this treating method comprises generation of a water current horizontal linear current flowing in one direction in this drawing with a relatively high predetermined flow rate about 0.6 to 2.0 m sec in a treating bath S defined, for example, by porous partition plates Fa, Fb or the like mounted at an upstream position and a downstream position in a portion of a water circulation passage. A treated person X is positioned in the water current in the treating bath S in a posture to receive the water current from a direction perpendicular to or approximately perpendicular to her lengthwise direction a standing posture or approximately a standing posture in this drawing .According to this method, the operation of applying the water current to the treated person X directly and continuously for a predetermined time about 15 to 60 minutes is effected intermittently repeatedly over a predetermined period of time. The water current may be a linear current flowing in one direction through the treating bath S as shown inFig. 1 or may comprise linear shower jet streams flowing in one direction through the treating bath S.Alternatively, a circular current may be employed which revolves in the treating bath S about an axis parallel to or approximately parallel to the lengthwise direction of the treated person X. Further, the water current may be a linear current flowing in a horizontal direction in the treating bath S in which the treated person is positioned in a standing posture as shown in Fig. 1, or may be a linear current flowing downwardly in the treating bath S in which the treated person X is positioned in a near lying posture as shown in Fig. 31, for example, which will be described later. The flow rate of the water current may suitably be adjusted according to the physical strength, health condition, treating time, treating period, fatigue state and so forth of the treated person X. Further, the temperature of the water current may suitably be adjusted according to an ambient temperature, and to the physical strength, health condition, treating time, treating period, fatigue state and so forth of the treated person, or may be adjusted in a more positive sense in order to promote perspiration. These adjustments will produce excellent results for slimming, beauty and health promotion, and from the point of view of comfortable training. Furthermore, the water current may be mixed with a cbsmetic agent or a nutrition promoting agent which assists in developing a beautiful skin, or with a bleaching agent, a germicidal agent, a cleaning agent or the like. Varied examples of water current type treatment apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion according to a second aspect of the present invention will be described hereinafter, the apparatus being constructed for carrying out the method according to the first aspect of the present invention. First Embodiment Large Circular Flow TankType Recirculating Water Current Apparatus for Slimming,Beauty and Health Promotion This apparatus is well suited for use, for example, in a training center, a hospital or the like and permits a relatively large number 4 to 6, for example of persons X to be treated or trained at the same time or together . The apparatus is constructed as shown inFig. 7. The apparatus comprises a circulation passage C mounted in an up and down direction or vertically on bases 1 and blocks 2 projecting from a downstairs floor.The circulation passage C includes an impeller type water current generating mechanism D inside a lower closed passage portion B. The circulation pasage C has an upper horizontal open passage portion A defining a treating bath C having a square cross section and a relatively large capacity, with a free water surface WS opening upstairs. This treating bath S has an extreme upstream end and an extreme downstream end defined by porous partition plates Fa, Fb permitting passage of the water current, respectively. The downstream porous partition plate Fb in particular, while acting to prevent the treated persons X from being washed away, is inclined at a suitable angle normally 10 to 30 degrees, which may be variable with an upper portion thereof positioned progressively toward a downstream side so as to provide a back support for the treated persons X.The treating bath S further includes a stair 6 at a lateral side thereof to allow the treated persons X to walk up and down. The stair 6 is provided with rails 7 extending along respective sides thereof to enable also a wheel chair and a platform car to be moved up and down.Furthermore, the treating bath S has a skidproof member 5 applied to an inner bottom surface to protect the treated persons X from slipping, and stationary bars 10 above a forward position and an intermediate position of the treating bath S for the treated persons X to hold on to directly, or for attaching straps 8 for the treated persons X to hold on to, and or for attaching belts 9 for supporting the waists of the treated persons X. The treating bath S has transparent observation windows not shown in a bottom wall and respective lateral walls, but these windows need not be provided. Number 3 in Fig. 7 denotes corner vanes and number 4 denotes a necessary space defined interiorly of the circulation passage C. Incidentally, with a water circulation tank for hydromechanical testing as shown in Fig. 2, a foamless, constant, linear current must be generated to flow at a highly uniformalized flow rate through a measuring section thereof corresponding to the treating bath S of the present invention. Therefore, it is essential to provide the water circulation tank of this kind with a rectifying device, a flow rate uniformalizing device and a foam eliminating device comprising a punched metal sheet, a honeycomb plate and a surface flow accelerator, and an entire circulation passage inevitably has a complicated configuration. Not only that, the measuring section is allowed a capacity of about 15 to 20 at most with respect to the entire circulation passage.On the other hand, the uniformity of flow rate and the foam offer no problem with the apparatus of this invention, and therefore the abovementioned rectifying device, flow rate uniformalizing device and foam eliminating device are omitted from this apparatus, with the entire circulation passage C having a very simple construction, and with the treating bath S having a large capacity of about 40 to 50 with respect to the entire circulation passage C. However, the foam eliminating device may be provided where foam is generated intensively in the circulation passage C. In Fig. 7, number 11 denotes an electric drive device a motor and reduction gearing for driving the impeller type water current generating mechanism D, number 12 denotes a heater with a recirculation pump for heating the water in the circulation passage C, number 13 denotes a city water normal temperature water supply pipe with an electromagnetic open close valve 14, and number 15 donotes an exhaust pipe with an electromagnetic open close valve 16.These electric drive device 11, heater 12 and electromagnetic valves 14, 16 are manually controllable through a controller 17, and also automatically controllable by feedback control by the controller 17 in response to water temperature and water level detections input to the controller 17 from a bath water temperature detector 18 and a bath water level detector 19, in order to maintain the water temperature and the water level at set values. More particularly, the flow rate of the linear current flowing in one direction through the treating bath S is adjusted to a selected value, up to about 2.0 m sec., set to the controller 17, by adjusting a rotational rate of the electric drive device 11 for rotating the impeller type water current generating mechanism D. The temperature of the water current flowing through the treating bath S is automatically adjusted to a selected value set to the controller 17, by opening and closing the electromagnetic valve 14 mounted in the city water supply pipe 13, opening and closing the electromagnetic valve 16 mounted in the exhaust pipe 15 or by controlling the heater 12 as necessary.The heater 12 is operable in response to a water temperature increasing instruction from the controller 17 to draw the water from the circulation passage C and return the water to the circulation passage C after heating it to a high temperature, and may be the gas combustion type, the electric type or any other type. The water level in the treating bath S is automatically adjusted to a selected value set to the controller 17, by opening and closing the electromagnetic valve 14 mounted in the city water supply pipe 13 and opening and closing the electromagnetic valve 1 6 mounted in the exhaust pipe 1 5 as necessary. Number 21 in the drawing denotes a handoperated auxiliary water supply duct. second Embodiment Medium Size CircularFlow Tank Type Recirculating Water Current Apparatus forSlimming, Beauty and Health Promotion This apparatus permits one person or a relatively small number 2 or 3, for example of persons to be treated or trained, and has a size to consume a minimum amount of water. The apparatus is well suited for use, for example, in a beauty salon or at welfare facilities or health maintenance facilities of a private corporation. More particularly, as shown in the schematic overall plan view of Fig. 8, the schematic front view ofFig. 9 a view taken on line III III of Fig. 8 , the schematic left side view of Fig. 10 a view taken on lineIV IV of Fig. 8 and the schematic right side view ofFig 11 a view taken on line V V of Fig. 8 , the apparatus comprises a circulation passage C mounted in a horizontal position on a floor G and a base 1 and blocks 2 arranged on the floor G and defining, in a horizontal open passage portion A, a treating bath S of a size to accommodate one person or a few persons under treatment in a standing posture or approximately a standing posture.The apparatus includes an impeller type water current generating mechanism D in a closed passage portion B continuous from upstream and downstream ends of the horizontal open passage portion A, to accelerate water contained in the circulation passage C in one direction. Thus, the apparatus constitutes a horizontal circulation type circulating water current apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion adapted to permit one person to be treated or trained alone or a plural number of two or three persons to be treated at the same time or together . The circulation pasage C having the horizontal open passage portion A and the closed passage portion B in this example comprises a plurality of blocks formed ofFRP and coupled to one another, but may be formed of a steel plate or a polyvinyl chloride plate. As clearly shown in Fig. 8, a boundary portion Ef between the horizontal open passage portion A constituting the treating bath S and the closed passage portion B positioned upstream thereof is shaped to flare in width from an upstream end to a downstream end thereof. By virtue of this construction the closed passage portion B positioned upstream of the horizontal open passage portion A has a minimal width. The above configuration has been devised in view of the factual situation that it is important to construct such a water current type apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion, on the one hand, to be as compact in its entirety as possible because of the emphasis placed on the necessity to frequently change the water in the circulating water bath from the hygienic point of view and to minimize manufacturing cost and installation space for the interest of its diffusion, and, on the other hand, to have a large width at the horizontal open passage portion A constituting the treating bath S just enough to include not only that much width occupied by the treated person or persons X but also a marginal width to enable smooth passage of the water through both sides of the treated person or personsX. In other words, the closed passage portion B disposed upstream of the horizontal open passage portion A has a minimum width, while a width just large enough to include the width occupied by the treated person or persons X and the marginal width for permitting the water to flow smoothly through right and left sides of the treated person or persons X is secured as a maximum width of the horizontal open passage portion A constituting the treating bath S whereby a sufficient amount of water current acts on the treated person or persons X.Thus, the entire circulation passage C is rendered very compact, and hence requires only a very small amount of water to be circulated, permitting the water current generating mechanism D to be small and the circulation passage C to be manufactured at low cost. This readily achieves a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost and running cost of the entire apparatus and also in the installation space for the apparatus. In constructing the boundary between the horizontal open passage portion A and the closed passage portion B disposed upstream thereof to be wider at the downstream end than at the upstream end, the example shown in Fig. 8 has the upstream end of the horizontal open passage portion A flaring progressively in the downstream direction. Instead of this arrangement, the closed passage portion B disposed upstream of the horizontal open passage portion A may be constructed to include a downstream end flaring progressively in the downstream direction. Further, a transitional part from the closed passage portion B to the horizontal open passage portion A may be shaped to grow wider in a stepped manner. In Fig. 8, number 3 denotes corner vanes, number 11 denotes an electric drive device for driving the impeller type water current generating mechanism D, number 12 denotes a heater with a recirculation pump for heating the water in the circulation passage C, number 13 denotes a city water supply pipe with an electromagnetic open close valve 14, number 15 denotes an exhaust pipe with an electromagnetic open close valve 16, number 17 denotes a controller 8, number 18 denotes a bath water temperature detector, and number 1 9 denotes a bath water level detector. These elements have the same constructions and functions as those in the preceding first embodiment. Next, details of the horizontal open passage portion A constituting the treating bath S will be described with reference to the cross sectional view ofFig. 12 a view taken on line VI VI of Fig. 8 , the cross sectional view of Fig. 13 a view taken on lineVII VII of Fig. 8 , and the vertical section of Fig. 14 a view taken on line VIII VIII of Fig. 8 . As shown, the horizontal open passage portion A includes porous partition plate Fa, Fb in lattice form at an extreme upstream end and an extreme downstream end thereof to permit passage of the water current. The downstream partition plate Fb has fine mesh net Fc similar to a fishing net spread over a front face thereof. Although this downstream partition plate Fb stands vertically in this example, it may be inclined at a suitable degree normally 10 to 30 degrees, which may be variable with an upper portion thereof positioned progressively toward a downstream side so as to provide a back support for the treated person or persons X. Further, the horizontal open passage portion A includes a horizontal catch bar member 22 removably attached to a forward position thereof above a water surface for the treated person X to hold on to so as not to be washed away. This horizontal catch bar member 22 is formed, for example, of a round steel or stainless steel bar or a round pipe, and is removably supported by a right and left pair of approximately U shaped supports 23, 23 rigidly attached to and projecting from inner surfaces of right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A. Furthermore, the horizontal open passage portion A includes lighting windows 24 formed of transparent acryl or glass plates at right and left corners in a bottom thereof, the windows being inclined at about 45 degrees in this example, through which illuminators 25 arranged outside the treating bath S throw light on the treated person X in the treating bath S. Videotaping windows 26 formed of transparent acryl or glass plates are mounted in the right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A, through which a video camera 27 disposed outside the treating bath S may photograph the treated person X in the treating bath S. The lightir windows 24, illuminators 25 and videotapi g wiriows 26 ay be mounted in only one of the lateral walls of the horizontal cpen passage portion A.Such a videotaping system enables the treated person X to become aware of changes in her own figure due to the water current or a trainer or instructor to observe conditions of the treated person X with great ease. It is also useful for collecting and storing data. Further still, the horizontal open passage portionA defines a downwardly projecding recess 28 approximately centrally of its bottom. This construction realizes a sufficient depth of water where the treated person or persons X stand s and at the same time minimizes the depth of water in the horizontal open passage portion A taken as a whole, which results in a further reduced capacity of the circulation passage C. Consequently, owing also to this aspect the entire circulation passageC is rendered very comp ct, and hence requires only a very small amount of water to be circulated, permitting the water current generating mechanism D to be E iall and the circulation passage C to be manufacdured at low cost.This readily achieves a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost and running cost of the entire apparatus. It will be noted that the recess 28 also performs a skidproofing function since peripheries thereof provide a foot catch for the treated person X. Although the recess 28 is shown having a circular shape in plan view according to this example, it may have a different shape such as a rectangular shape. As shown in a dot and dash line in Fig. 15, the recess 28 may have a bottom surface inclined such that the surface rises higher toward a forward end thereof. Also, as shown in a double dots and dash line in Fig. 15, the recess 2 may have an inverted trapezoidal sectional shape. Further, a turntable 29 is mounted in the recess 28, as shown, to be rotatable on a vertical axis Y to permit the treated person X to make a twisting motion or the like with ease. The turntable 29 may be removably mounted in the recess 28, or may be mounted in a constantly fixed manner by means of a fixed ring 30 as shown in Fig. 15. Where the turntable 29 is mounted in a constantly fixed manner as in the latter case, it will be convenient to arrange the turntable 29 switchable by means of an oscillating type stopper 31 or the like between a rotatable state and a locked state. Incidentally, the aforesaid projecting U shaped supports 23 for supporting the horizontal catch bar member 22 for the treated person X to hold on to in order not to be washed away, may be replaced by verticaly elongate support recesses 23 defined respectively in inner surfaces of the right and left walls of the horizontal open pasage portion A, as shown in Fig. 16 a , b . The projecting U shaped supports 23 or support recesses 23 may readily be formed integral when shaping the blocks from FRP. When the treated person is training in the bath S, water often splashes into her mouth causing her to feel like spitting. From the hygienic point of view, it will be very convenient to make good use of the horizontal catch bar member 22 and provide a spit tray 32 at an intermediate position thereof as shown in Figs. 17 and 1 8. In this case the horizontal catch bar member 22 may comprise a pipelike material with, for example, at least opposite ends 22A thereof formed angular so as to be unrotatably supported by the U shaped supports 23 projecting from the right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A.In this case too, the projecting U shaped supports 23 may be replaced by the vertically elongate support recesses 23 defined respectively in the inner surfaces of the right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A.Further, as shown in Fig. 19 a , b , it will be convenient to have at least one of the right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A define a spit drain bore 33 and an auxiliary perforation 34 for use in attaching and detaching the horizontal catch bar member 22. Fig. 20 shows a further example of application.As shown, back support bar members 35, 36 in form of uneven parallel bars are provided in underwater positions in the horizontal open passage portion A for supporting an upper back portion and the buttocks of the treated person X to enable the treated person X to receive the water current in a comfortable posture. These back supporting parallel bar members 35, 36 too, desirably, are formed of round bars or round pipes from the point of view of the touch felt by the treated person X and resistance characteristics with respect to the water current. Where the back supporting parallel bar members 35, 36 are provided, the horizontal catch bar member 22 may be dispensed with.As support means for these back supporting parallel bar members 35, 36, projecting support members 37 or support recesses 38 desirably having such a shape as to reliably retain the bar members 35, 36 against the water current are defined by the right and left lateral walls of the horizontal open passage portion A. Fig. 22 shows another example of application. As shown, the treating bath S defined in the horizontal open passage portion A includes a single back supporting horizontal bar member 39 against which the treated person X may lean back. The back supporting horizontal bar member 39 carries a pair of spot stimulating projections 40 for pressing against effective spots in the back or nape of the treated person X. More particularly, the inner surfaces of the right and left lateral walls of the treating bath S define mutually opposed bar supporting recesses 41 for receiving and engaging respective ends of the back supporting horizontal bar member 39, and the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 is removably supported by the right and left bar supporting recesses 41, namely removably mounted relative to the treating bath S. Each of the right and left bar supporting recesses 41 comprises a bar moving inclined groove 41a with an upper portion thereof positioned progressively rearwardly, and a plurality of bar supporting horizontal grooves 41b branching rearwardly from the bar moving inclined groove 41a, whereby the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 is variable in its vertical position and fore and aft position with respect to the treating bath S.Thus, the treated person X may set the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 to any selected position at will such as a position suited to stimulate spots in the nape by means of the spot stimulating projections 40, a position suited to stimulate spots in the upper back lower shoulders , a position suited to stimulate spots in the lower back waist or a position suited to stimulate spots in the buttocks. Details of the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 and the spot stimulating projections 40 are as follows. As shown in Fig. 23, the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 is formed of a strong round pipe such as a surface coated steel pipe and carries caps 42 of rubber or other elastic material covering the opposite engaging ends thereof engageable with the bar supporting recesses 41 bar supporting horizontal grooves 41b defined in the inner surfaces of the right and left lateral walls of the treating bath S. The pair of spot stimulating projections 40 each comprise a ring element formed of rubber or other elastic material fitted tight on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39.More particularly, the pair of spot stimulating projections 40 comprising elastic ring elements are each fixed in position, in its natural condition, on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 by a frictional force between an inside face thereof and an outer face of the back supporting horizontal bar member 39, and are forcibly slidable as shown by arrows Z1 in the drawing, to vary transverse positions thereof on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 and a mutual distance The above arrangement that the pair of the spot stimulating projections 40 are forcibly slidable on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 to vary the transverse positions and the mutual distance X , has the advantage that the treated person X can accurately place the spot stimulating projections 40 against desired spots of her body. Fig. 24 a , b shows a modified example of the spot stimulating projections 40, wherein the pair of spot stimulating projections 40 are rotatable in directions indicated by an arrow Z2 relative to the back supporting horizontal bar member 39, respectively, in addition to being forcibly slidable in the directions indicated by the arrows Z1 relative to the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 to vary the transverse positions and the distance Z between each other on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 and fixable when in the natural state. In this case each of the pair of spot stimulating projections 40, as shown, comprises a roller member including a relatively thin elastic ring element 40B fixed to an inside face of a bearing or other rotary element 40A for producing a frictional force and a relatively thick elastic ring element 40C fixed to an outside face of the bearing or other rotary element 40A for spot stimulating purposes. The described arrangement in which the pair of spot stimulating projections 40 are rotatable about the back supporting horizontal bar member 39, has the advantage that little or no friction occurs between outer faces of the spot stimulating projections 40 and the skin of the treated person X, thereby to cause no pain for the treated person X. While the foregoing examples include a pair of two spot stimulating projections 40 mounted on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39, only one spot stimulating projection or many may be provided. Outstanding advantages are produced by the described back supporting horizontal bar member 21 carrying the spot stimulating projections 40 and mounted in the treating bath S. More particularly, the treated person X may select any desired posture suited to herself from a variety of postures, i.e. not only a posture to receive the water current while just holding on to the horizontal catch bar member 22, but also a posture leaning against the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 while holding on to the horizontal catch bar member 22, and a posture just leaning against the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 without holding the horizontal catch bar member 22.Even if the hand should inadvertently lose hold of the horizontal catch bar member 22, the body would be supported by the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 which effectively prevents the treated person from tumbling down washed bythe water current, thereby assuring safety. Besides, by leaning against the back supporting horizontal bar member 39 the treated person X can enjoy a very comfortable feeling and very effectively eliminate stiffness of the shoulder while receiving water current massages over the entire body and pleasant stimulations at spots in the back or the nape by means of the spot stimulating projections 40 mounted on the back supporting horizontal bar member 39.Moreover, since the water current flowing through the treating bath S is generated mainly by the impeller type water current generating mechanism, it includes pulsating flow components of considerably high frequency, by nature. Such a water current producesKarman vortexes around the body of the treated person X, further complicating the pulsating flow components.Therefore, complex stimulations due to the pulsating flow components, and not just a simple pressing force, act through the spot stimulating projections 40 upon the spots in the back or nape of the treated person X receiving the water current massages, which is most desirable in providing good comfort. Fig. 25 and Fig. 26 show a unit U including, in a single room in a compact, attractive and decorated manner, the main body portion of the medium size circular flow tank type recirculating water current apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion, excluding the mechanical parts such as the electric drive device 11, heater 12, city water supply pipe 13 and exhaust pipe 15. Number 43 in the drawings denotes a room frame having a door 44. Only the horizontal open pasage portion A constituting the treating bath S of the main body of the appratus is open, as it is, to an upper portion of the room, the other passage portions being covered by smoothly planed boards. Thus, number 45 denotes a passage leading to the door 44, number 46 denotes a forward platform and number 47 denotes a rearward platform. The passage 45 includes a table 49 with a trainer s seat 48 and the controller 17, stools 50 for the treated person herself and her attendants or the like, a changing room 51, a shower and toilet compartment 52 and so forth.The forward platform 46 supports a TV set for showing a picture of the interior of the treating bath S taken by the video camera 27 and flower pots and others, and the rearward platform 47 supports an air conditioner 54, flower pots and so forth. By employing the horizontal circulation type circulating water current apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion of the described construction for the above slimming, beauty and health promotion unit U, the unit U may naturally have a minimum floor area necessary for the purpose and a minimum height. It is therefore more suitable for constructing the compact unitU than a vertical circulation type apparatus described later. The mechanical parts such as the electric drive device 11, heater 12, city water supply pipe 13 and exhaust pipe 1 5 may also be disposed in each room frame 43, but these mechanical parts are arranged outside each room frame 43 in this example to facilitate installation and maintenance. Fig. 27 shows an example of centralized control system with a plurality of such circulating water current type slimming, beauty and health promotion units U arranged side by side, in which controls of each unit U and instructions for each treated person X are effected from a single controlroom T. More particularly, in the drawing, number 55 denotes a front door to the system, number 56 denotes a janitor s room, number 57 denotes a corridor, number 58 denotes an emergency exit, and number 59 denotes machine rooms. The controlroom T includes a plurality of TV cameras 61 in an arcuate arrangement to output pictures and sound signals transmitted from the video cameras 27 and interphones 61 of the respective units U, and a controller 62 adapted to effect controls of the units U and provide instructions for the treated persons X, respectively. In the case of this centralized control system, the controller and the trainer s seat need not be provided in each unit U, as shown, and also the number of trainers may be cut drastically which assures a great economical merit. Fig. 28 shows a further modification of this apparatus according to the second embodiment. Here, not only the boundary Ef between the horizontal open passage portion A constituting the treating bath S and the closed passage portion B disposed upstream thereof is shaped such that its downstream end is wider than its upstream end, but a boundary Ea between the horizontal open passage portion A and the closed passage portion B disposed downstream thereof is shaped such that its downstream end is narrower than its upstream end. This construction permits the closed passage portions B disposed upstream and downstream of the horizontal open passage portion A both to have a minimum width. According to the above construction, the closed passage portions B disposed upstream and downstream of the horizontal open passage portion A have a minimum width, while a width just enough to include a width occupied by the treated person X and a marginal width for permitting the water to flow smoothly through right and left sides of the treated person X is secured as a maximum width of the treating bath whereby a sufficient amount of water current acts on the treated person X.Thus, the entire circulation passage C is rendered very compact, and hence requires only a very small amount of water to be circulated, permitting the water current generating mechanism D to be small and the circulation passage C to be manufactured at low cost. This readily achieves a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost and running cost of the entire apparatus and also in the installation space for the apparatus Since the horizontal open passage portion A is constricted at its downstream portion, the water current will readily flow round rearwardly of the treated person X which produces a secondary advantage of assuring an improved water current massaging effect. In constructing the upstream boundary Ef to be wider at the downstream end than at the upstream end and the downstream boundary Ea to be narrower at the downstream end than at the upstream end, the above example has the upstream end of the horizontal open passage portion A flaring progressively in the downstream direction and the downstream end tapering progressively in the downstream direction. Instead of this arrangement, the closed passage portion B disposed upstream of the horizontal open passage portion A may be constructed to include a downstream end flaring progressively in the downstream direction, and the closed passage pordion B disposed downstream of the horizontal open passage portion A constructed to include an upstream end tapering progressively in the downstream direction.Further, a transitional part from the upstream closed passage portion B to the horizontal open passage portion A may be shaped to grow wider in a stepped manner, and a transitional part from the horizontal open passage portion A to the downstream closed passage portion B shaped tc grow narrower in a stepped manner. Incidentally, the various arrangements according to the present invention and other devices described in connection with the foregoing embodiment are applicable not only to the described horizontal circulation type circulating water current apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion but, of course, to a vertical circulation type circulating water current apparatus for slimming, beauty and health promotion as shown in Fig. 29 a , b . The other reference numbers affixed in these drawings correspond to and have basically the same functions as those in the foregoing embodiment. Thus, descriptions of the elements affixed with the same reference numbers are omitted. Third Embodiment Small Circular Flow TankType Recirculating Water Current Apparatus for Slimming,Beauty and Health Promotion This is a compact and personal type apparatus for only one person to be treated or trained and is well suited for use by a household or in a hotel room. The apparatus is constructed as shown in Fig. 30 a , b . A first outstanding feature of this apparatus is that a circulation passage including a treating bath S is constructed without the inside space 4 as in the first embodiment shown in Fig. 7 and in the second embodiment shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 28 and Fig. 29. In other words, the entire apparatus is defined by a box having a twopart structure to drastically diminish the size of the apparatus as a whole. By employing such a construction, for example, a treating bath S of the dimensions length x width x depth height 1.6 m x 1.0 m x 1.0 m 1.2 m may be incorporated into a whole apparatus of the dimensions length x width x height 2.2 m x 1.2 m x 1.5 m or thereabout. Then the apparatus is well suited for installation at a private home. A second outstanding feature is that a bottom portion of the treating bath S over an impeller type water current generating mechanism D is elevated to form a seat 63 for the treated person X. And by making effective use of a large space in a lower passage of the circulation passage resulting from the elevation of the bottom, a relatively large impeller may be employed as the water current generating mechanism D, whereby the appratus although small readily and reliably realizes a water current of sufficient flow rate. This apparatus is available for varied uses. For example, the treated person X may kneel down holding a hand rail 64 to slim her waist and thighs into good shape or may be seated on the seat 63 to slim mainly her waist into good shape, as shown. Further, although not shown, she may stand holding the hand rail 64 to slim her thighs and calves. into good shape. The other reference numbers affixed in the drawings correspond to and have basically the same functions as those in the foregoing embodiments. Thus, descriptions of the elements affixed with the same reference numbers are omitted. Fourth Embodiment Bathtub Type CircularWater Current Apparatus for Slimming, Beauty and HealthPromotion This too is a compact and personal type apparatus permitting only one person to be treated or trained and is particularly well suited for household use or for use in a private room of a hospital. or the like. The apparatus is constructed as shown in Fig. 31 a , b , c . This apparatus has a treating bath S serving also as an ordinary boxlike bathtub installed in a bathroom of a private dwelling house. The boxlike bathtub constituting the treating bath S includes an impeller type water current generating mechanism. D in a recess 66 with a mesh cover 65, which recess is defined in a position of a lower side wall displaced to one corner, the water current generating mechanism being rotatable on an axis slanted slightly upwardly. As the impeller type water current generating mechanism D rotates, an approximately horizontal circular water current is generated in the boxlike bathtub constituting the bath S, that is a circular flow is generated to circulate about an axis extending in a lengthwise direction or an approximately lengthwise direction of the treated personX positioned approximately centrally of the bath S. This bath S includes a cylindrical stool 67 upstanding from the center of the bottom thereof for the treated person X to sit on. This cylindrical stool 67 also acts to stabilize the horizontal circular current generated by the impeller type water current generating mechanism D.However, this cylindrical stool 67 is not absolutely necessary. Number 68 in the drawings denotes a chained plug. This apparatus too is available for varied uses.For example, the treated person X may kneel down holding a hand rail 64 to slim her waist and thighs into good shape or may be seated on the stool 67 to slim mainly her waist into good shape, as shown. Further, although not shown, she may stand holding the hand rail 64 to slim her thighs and calves into good shape. The above circular current, of course, produces an excellent effect for slimming, beauty and health promotion substantially equal to the effect produced by the linear current flowing in one direction as in the already described various embodiments. This circular water current type apparatus according to the fourth embodiment as constructed above also includes a basic structure available for use as a washing machine. Therefore, the apparatus may additionally include devices provided for an ordinary washing machine such as an overflow opening 69 defined in an upper portion of a side wall of the bath S as shown and the impeller type water current generating mechanismD whose rotation is reversible every predetermined time lapse.This permits cold water or warm water remaining after a beauty and slimming training or bathing to be effectively utilized to wash laundry in a very convenient manner. Further, the above arrangement permits three apparatuses, i.e. a slimming, beauty and health promotion apparatus, a bathing apparatus and a laundry washing apparatus, to be combined into a single apparatus which is neither very large nor complicated, which assures a great advantage in terms of economy and installation space and is extremely effective for improvement in the way of living hereafter. It will be even more convenient if the present apparatus is integrally provided with a dehydrator 70 and a dryer 71 as indicated by phantom lines in Fig. 31 c . The other reference numbers affixed in the drawings correspond to and have basically the same functions as those in the foregoing embodiments. Thus, descriptions of the elements affixed with the same reference numbers are omitted. In this example, however, a heater 1 2 acts also as a bath furnace or a hot water supplying device. fifth Embodiment Shower Jet Type WaterCurrent Apparatus for Slimming, Beauty and HealthPromotion This apparatus is adapted to apply a water current to a treated person in form of linear shower jet streams, and is constructed as shown in Fig. 32. This construction comprises a treating bath S formed of a box including a header 72 mounted at a top position therein to direct or shoot shower jet water streams downwardly, a reservoir 73 at a bottom position therein for storing the water falling from the header 72, and a a circulation passage C with a pump D for feeding under pressure the water in the reservoir 73 to the header 72.The box further includes a porous bed 74 at a vertically intermediate position therein, namely between the header 72 above and the reservoir 73 below, to permit the treated person to lie in a horizontal posture or approximately horizontal posture and to permit the shower jet streams falling from the header 72 with the person in that state to pass to the reservoir 73. This porous bed 74 has an upper surface formed of a porous cushion material 74a. Although in this fifth embodiment the shower jet streams are directed or shot downwardly from above, the shower jet streams may be directed horizontally against a standing person under treatment. Further, a mere water current instead of the shower jet streams may be caused to fall. The other reference numbers affixed in the drawing correspond to and have basically the same functions as those in the foregoing embodiments. Thus, descriptions of the elements affixed with the same reference numbers are omitted. Industrial Applicability As is clear from the foregoing description, the method of water current type treatment for slimming, beauty and health promotion and apparatus therefor according to the present invention are adapted to produce excellent effects in varied applications such as slimming and beauty or body shaping treatment, promotion of health not only physically but also mentally, sports training, rehabilitation and so forth. The present method and apparatus are very well adapted for use in beauty salons, training centers, hospitals and the like, and also has high utility at health control and welfare facilities of private corporations. Accordingly, the present invention has a very high degree of utility in the fields in which the method and apparatus embodying the present invention are used or manufactured.
