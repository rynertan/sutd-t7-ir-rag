# VARIABLE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE DEVICE

## Abstract
A variable electrical resistance device for monitoring displacement of a mechanical component such as a vehicle road wheel suspension system comprises a housing 1 an electrically resistive track 6 and conductive slip ring 9 a support 7 in the housing 1 electrically conductive wipers 2,8 on a rotatable carrier 3 provided with a spindle 4 for coupling to the component. The wipers 2, 8 traverse the resistive track 6 and the slip ring 9 respectively. The support 7 is mounted on springs 10A, 10B, 10C or flat strips of resilient metal, so as to be displaceable away from and towards the wipers 2,8 . A solenoid 14 , of double acting type or acting in association with the bias of the springs 10A, 10B, 10C , has an armature 15 operating to effect displace ment of the support 7 away from and towards the wiper 2 whereby contact between the wiper 2 and track 6 may be broken, or the contact pressure therebetween reduced, when monitoring is not required, thereby prolonging the life of the wiper 2 and track 6 assembly.
