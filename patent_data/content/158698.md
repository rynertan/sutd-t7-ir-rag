## Description
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing β type silicon nitride whiskers, and particularly to a method of manufacturing β type silicon nitride whiskers by which well developed β type silicon nitride whiskers having a long fiber length can be easily produced at a relatively low temperature of 1,250 1,450 C. In general, the application of β type silicon nitride whiskers has been eagerly expected as a fiber reinforcement for a composite material because of excellent high temperature strength and thermal shock resistance of silicon nitride. As the prior techniques relating to the present invention, there are the following methods, but they are quite different from the present invention for the reasons also stated below. Therefore, the invention cannot easily be inferred therefrom. The invention is to provide a method of commercially advantageously producing β type silicon nitride whiskers. In the conventional techniques, a problem is the phase transition of Si₃N₄ in the case that the Si₃N₄ whiskers are mixed into Si₃N₄ powder, and are used as a reinforcement of the Si₃N₄ sintered body. Si₃N₄ has two crystal phase, α type and β type, which belong to the hexagonal system. The dimension of crystal lattices of both the crystal types is that a Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 96, No. 20, 17th May 1982, page 668, column 1, abstract No. 172276t, discloses the influence of fluorides on vapor phase growth of silicon nitride whiskers. In view of the above circumstances, upon strenuously having made studies, the present inventors have accomplished the invention. That is, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a well developed β type Si₃N₄ whiskers of a long fiber length at a relatively low temperature, for instance, 1,250 1,450 C. According to the method of manufacturing the β type silicon nitride whiskers in the present invention, a mixture of silica, carbon and cryolite in a molar ratio of 1 2 10 1 12 1 4 is heated, at a relatively low temperature of 1,250 1,450 C in a mixture atmosphere of N₂ NH₃, a molar ratio of NH₃ to N₂ being from about 1 48 to about 1 5. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be well appreciated upon reading of the following description of the invention when taken in connection with the appended claims and the attached drawings. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein The production reaction of silicon nitride Si₃N₄ whiskers according to a silica reduction process using N₂ gas is shown by the following two formulae The inventors have found that β type Si₃N₄ whiskers can be manufactured at a relatively low temperature by reacting silica with carbon in the presence of cryolite in N₂ atmosphere to which a small amount of NH₃ is added. Since the reaction in the formula 1 is a solid reaction between SiO₂ and C, the reaction rate is slow. When cryolite is present in the reaction between SiO₂ and C, however, SiO₂ is changed to a silicate fused body by the action of this flux, which results in the reaction between the liquid and the solid C and is represented by the following formula 3 The reaction rate of this reaction is far promoted as compared with the conventional solid reaction and the production of the SiO is extremely activated. Meanwhile, when NH₃ is added to the reaction atmosphere, gaseous SiO produced in the formula 3 reacts according to the following formula 4 due to a powerful reducing action of H₂ gas generated through thermal decomposition of NH₃. The thus produced Si gas reacts with N₂ to produce crystal nuclei of β type Si₃N₄ according to the following formula 5 It is in conformity with the ordinary crystal growth theory that the crystal nuclei of β type Si₃N₄ thus formed grow as the β type crystals even under conditions where the α type crystals are produced according to the reaction 2 . Therefore, the production of the β type Si₃N₄ whiskers proceeds according to the reactions 4 , 5 and 2 . It is a question why the β type Si₃N₄ is produced according to the reaction 5 although when a single crystal of Si is heated and converted to Si vapor, which is reacted with N₂ gas, α type Si₃N₄ is produced. This is because Si vapor obtained through reduction of SiO under heating is different in physical properties from that obtained by heating the Si single crystal. This may be illustrated by the similar phenomenon in the case where a single crystal is produced from a fused body as another embodiment in which a single crystal containing Fe According to the invention, the mixing ratio of silica to carbon is 1 2 to 1 10, preferably about 1 4 in a molar ratio. If the molar ratio of carbon is lower than the above range, the reaction 1 is difficult to proceed, while on the contrary, when it exceeds the above range, the amount of unreacted carbon residue increases, and the reaction yield unfavorably lowers. The mixing ratio of silica to cryolite cannot be definitively determined because the synergistic effects of the cryolite and NH₃ added in the nitrogen atmosphere is remarkable, but is preferably about 1 1 12 1 1 4 in a molar ratio of SiO₂ Na₃AlF₆. When the molar ratio of N₂ to NH₃ in the mixed atmosphere N₂ NH₃ is 24 1, the ratio of SiO₂ to Na₃AlF₆ is more preferred to be 1 1 10 1 1 6. If the amount of cryolite is more than the above range, the amount of fused silicate formed in the reaction is too much, so that the flowing movement of N₂ gas and SiO gas is interrupted. Thereby, the reactions 4 and 5 are difficult to proceed and SiC is unfavorably formed in the residue. Reversely, when it is less than the above range, the reaction 3 is retarded and the unreacted SiO₂ is unfavorably formed in the residue. The mixing ratio of NH₃ to N₂ is preferably not higher than 1 5, more preferably not higher than 1 12 in a molar ratio. If the mixing ratio exceeds 1 5, the partial pressure of N₂ in the mixing gas atmosphere is too lower and a large amount of SiC is likely to be unfavorably produced in the residue. In the case of N₂ gas alone, α type Si₃N₄ whiskers are likely to be produced and no β type Si₃N₄ whiskers are obtained. As mentioned above, an appropriate amount of NH₃ and cryolite are indispensable for the present invention. The reaction temperature is 1,250 1,450 C. If the temperature is lower than 1,250 C, the reaction is difficult to proceed and the yield is extremely low. On the other hand, if it exceeds 1,450 C, no silicon nitride is produced and silicon carbide is produced instead. The reaction temperature is preferably 1,300 1,500 C. The present invention will be explained more in detail with reference to Examples in comparison with Comparative Examples. Silicate anhydride silica , activated carbon and cryolite each being powder passing through 100 meshes were dry mixed with one another in molar ratios as shown in the following Table to obtain a sample material 5. 1 g of each of the mixed raw material samples 5 was charged into a vessel 4 made of carbon as shown in Fig. 1, which was then placed into a protection tube 3 made of mullite. This mullite tube was placed into an electric furnace 1 using a furnace core tube 2. While a mixed gas 6 of N₂ and NH₃ having a molar ratio as shown in the following Table was introduced into the furnace core tube 2 in a direction shown by the arrow in Fig. 1, the reaction was effected in the atmosphere of N₂ NH₃ at a temperature of 1,350 C for 24 hours under heating. On the other hand, while an exhaust gas 7 was exhausted in a direction shown by the arrow in Fig. 1. In this case, the flow rate of the introduced mixed atmosphere gas 6 was 50 cc min, and the reaction was effected while the pressure of the interior of the furnace core tube 2 was kept at about atmospheric pressure. The silicon nitride whiskers produced on the inner surface of the protection tube 3 was observed by X ray diffraction. The contents weight of α phase and β phase are also shown in the following Table 1. As apparent from the above Table, the amount of cryolite in the raw material 5 in Comparative Examples 1 and 5 is outside the range in the method according to the present invention, and these Comparative Examples are unfavorable in that the content of the α type silicon nitride whiskers is high or β cyalone Si In Comparative Examples 2 to 4, the molar ratio of N₂ NH₃ in the mixed atmosphere gas 6 was outside the range of the present invention. They are no good in that the content of the α type silicon nitride whiskers is high, or β cyalone and SiC are produced. On the other hand, in any of Examples 1 5 of the method according to the present invention, well developed β type silicon nitride whiskers having a high purity, a content of the β type silicon nitride of not lower than 80 , a diameter of 0.2 1.5 µ and a length of about 5 mm in the average were obtained. Namely, the conspicuous effects of the present invention can be observed in these Examples. As mentioned above, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of easily manufacturing the flexible and well developed β type silicon nitride whiskers having a long fiber length at a relatively low temperature.
