# Fiber optic amplifier.

## Abstract
A pair of small diameter optical fibres 14, 12 are arranged in a side by side configuration, the first fiber 14 doped with a material which will lase at the signal frequency, and the second fiber 12 providing a pumping source. The signal to be amplified propagates through the first fiber 14 to stimulate emission of coherent light from the lasing material, resulting in amplification of the signal. The refrac tive index of the first and second fibers 14, 12 are selected such that the signal in the first fiber 14 is well guided, while the pumping light in the second fiber 12 is unguided, yielding low losses in the first fiber 14 but high transfer of the pumping light from the second fiber 12 to the first fiber 14 .
