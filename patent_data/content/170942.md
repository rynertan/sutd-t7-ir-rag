# INFLATABLE RADIOLOGICAL INSPECTION TOOL FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS

## Abstract
An inflatable radiological underwater inspection tool for nuclear reactors, and in particular, for the radiological inspec tion of reactor vessel nozzle to safe end welds. The tool is con structed of a water tight housing and an inflatable bladder to be used in displacing reactor coolant from the operating vicin ity of the radiation path of a panoramic iridium source. With the inspection tool properly centered within the reactor vessel nozzle and with radiographic plates fastened around the out side diameter of the nozzle to safe end weld, the bladder is pressurized and the iridium source is dispensed to the housing from a remote shielded location. After exposure, the radiogra phic plates, in the nature of film cassettes, are removed and in terpreted for detecting defects in the weld volume.
