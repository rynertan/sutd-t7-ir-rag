# Process for the production of sheet like material comprising split fibres and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A process for producing a sheet like material of split fibers, and an apparatus therefor are described. The process includes the steps of introducing a plurality of continuous fiber bundles 18 into a liquid contained in an inclined splitting unit 6 which is gradually widened toward the lower end thereof, the unit being divided into a plurality of grooves 8 so that each fiber bundle travels in the liquid flowing in the corresponding groove, splitting each fiber bundle by the action of the liquid flowing in the groove while gradually widening the flow toward the lower end of the groove, uniformly arranging the resulting split fibers in a subsequent inclined splitting unit 14 , and continuously placing the thus arranged split fibers on a rotating conveyor 17 to form the sheet like material.
