# Duplex copy printing system and method.

## Abstract
A system for generating complete sets of copies after a jam occurs with respect to copy sheets is effected by maintaining count of sheets reaching an exit pocket 43 and retained in a duplex tray 33 for determining therefrom images lost due to the jam and responsive thereto generating replacement copies. For effecting job recovery due to jams occurring during imaging of duplex copies, replacement sheets are generated immediately after each jam to replace sheets lost due to the jam by determining the number of pages to be printed, dividing this number by two, and subtracting therefrom the count of sheets in the duplex tray and in the exit pocket, with this determination being then used to control generation of first side images on sheets needed for replacement purposes with said sheets being then conveyed to the duplex tray so that the resulting duplex copy generation is complete when reaching the exit pocket.
