# Aircraft skin antenna.

## Abstract
A holographic aircraft antenna 10 and method of fabricating the antenna 10 are disclosed herein. The antenna 10 includes a thin layer of dielectric strips 12 of material contoured to and mounted on the conductive skin 14 of the aircraft 16 or a plurality of thin metal conducting strips 12 secured to the skin of a composite aircraft. The spacing, width and size of the thin strips 12 forms a hologram which is determined by the interference pattern of radio frequency beams selected for and directed at a holographic recording medium at particular angles to pro vide a desired or series of desired radiation patterns. In addition, a radar reduction device is provided wherein the hologram includes thin strips of dielectric material 12 on the conductive skin of the aircraft or thin metal conducting strips 12 on the composite aircraft. The radar reduction hologram is mounted so that interrogating radar beams become entrapped surface waves directed longitudinally and along the axis of the wings thereby providing minimum reflection of the radar beam to reduce the size of the aircraft detected by the radar apparatus.
