# Solvent extraction and purification of acid soluble oil from an HF alkylation unit.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for recovering HF catalyst and acid soluble oil from an HF alkylation unit acid stream containing HF and acid soluble oils wherein the acid stream is charged to a distillation column and wherein free HF acid and stripping fluid added to the column, are removed as an overhead fraction. A bottoms fraction is removed from this column containing acid soluble oil and some HF. This bottoms fraction is cooled and mixed with a light hydrocar bon, and the mixture is allowed to settle. The mixture separates into an HF lean acid soluble oil, plus solvent upper phase and an HF rich acid soluble oil lower phase. The HF lean phase may be withdrawn from the process as a product or upgraded to improve its quality, permitting recycle of the HF rich phase with reduced acid soluble oil content, to the alkylation unit.
