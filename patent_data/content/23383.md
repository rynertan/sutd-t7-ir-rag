# Cementing head apparatus and method of injecting a cementing plug into a well casing.

## Abstract
A cementing head apparatus for injecting a cementing plug 20b into a well casing. The apparatus comprises a head unit 10 , manifold unit 33,34 , and a tubular mandrel 35a slidably mounted within the manifold unit. Prior to injecting a cement slurry into the well casing 25 , the cementing plug 20b is mounted in the head unit 10 and held in place by a shearable O ring 21 . During the cement ing operation, part of the slurry stream flows through the head unit 10 below the cementing plug 20b , and part of the slurry collects in a head space above the plug. This arrangement provides an equal and balanced pressure force on opposite sides of the plug 20b to prevent premature injection of the plug 20b into the well casing 25 . When the desired amount of cement has been pumped, the mandrel 35a is moved to a position which cuts off the cement flow and diverts another fluid only into the space above the plug 20b . The resulting loss of pressure below the plug 20b and maintenance of pressure above the plug 20b shears the O ring 21 and allows the plug 20b to follow the slurry into the well casing 25 .
