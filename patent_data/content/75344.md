# Apparatus for scarfing.

## Abstract
An inspection track is scarfed by moving a burner across a flat surface of a steel slab, particularly a slab of ductile steel of deep drawing quality, to enable sub surface inspection of the slab. To achieve accurate con trol of the depth of the track, the burner is mounted on a burner carriage having at least one skid surface which contacts the slab surface of the slab at an unscarfed region thereof. A guide track is spaced from the slab surface and the carriage is moved with said skid making sliding contact with the slab surface while guided by said guide track. The skid surface makes substantial contact pressure with the slab surface so that scale on the slab surface is pushed aside and or crushed by the skid surface whereby the burner is maintained at a substantially constant distance from the slab surface.
