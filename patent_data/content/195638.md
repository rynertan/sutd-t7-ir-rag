# Method and compositions for the control of dust.

## Abstract
Dust is suppressed by contacting a dust producing material with an emulsion containing a 20 99.5 of water and, correspondingly, b 80 0.5 of a composition compris ing from 0.1 to 20 of at least one methacrylate polymer, a minimum of 70 of at least one hydrophobic liquid and 0.01 to 10 of at least one emulsifying surfactant, all percentages being by weight. The above described emul sions and the composition b are novel.
