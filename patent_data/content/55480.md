# Process for producing aromatic polyester amide.

## Abstract
An aromatic polyester amide is produced by reacting hydroxyphenyl aminophenyl propane with aromatic dicar boxylic acid dihalide in the presence of an inert organic solvent, and bringing the organic solvent phase containing the mixture of the reaction products of the above reaction into contact with an aqueous phase containing an acid acceptor, whereby completing polycondensation reaction. In order to control the dissolution of water into the organic solvent phase while maintaining an adequate level of miscibility between the organic solvent phase and the aqueous phase, a neutral salt of inorganic electrolyte, such as sodium chloride, is added to the aqueous phase contain ing the acid acceptor.
