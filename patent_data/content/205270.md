# RADIOLABELED ANTIPLATELET MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY FOR IMAGING IN VIVO THROMBI

## Abstract
There is provided a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody of the class IgG‚ÇÅ which reacts readily with both normal human and dog blood platelets while failing to react with thrombas thenic human platelets. This antibody has the property of completely blocking interaction of fibrinogen with platelets induced by ADP, and the ability to detect fresh thrombi in vivo.
