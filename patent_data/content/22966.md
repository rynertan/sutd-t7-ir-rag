# Ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus is provided with a plurality of phased array transducer elements 14 1 to 14 n arranged in a row. The number of simultaneously driven transducer elements is changed in response to a rate pulse to increase the ultrasonic scanning line density without increasing the number of the transducer elements, while the position of the focal point is adjusted to maintain the minimum width position of the ultrasonic beam provided by the group of the simultaneously driven transducer elements substantially constant irrespective of the change of the number of the simultaneously driven transducer elements by controlling the phase of transmitted and received ultrasonic waves by means of delay elements LI to Ln .
