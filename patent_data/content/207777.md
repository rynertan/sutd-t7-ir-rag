# A hinge mechanism.

## Abstract
A hinge mechanism including a sleeve member 5 hav ing an inwardly facing bearing surface and a rod member 1 dimensioned to fit in the sleeve member 5 in engagement with the bearing surface. The sleeve member 5 is resiliently flexible but substantially inextensible and has at least one recess 6 formed in its bearing surface, the rod member 1 being provided with a projection 2 shaped to be engageable in the recess 6 . The rod member 1 is an interference fit in the sleeve member 5 with the projection 2 located in the recess 6 with the rod member 1 is rotatable in the sleeve member 5 by causing only resilient deformation of the latter.
