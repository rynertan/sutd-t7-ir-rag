# Semiconductor intregrated circuits and manufacturing process thereof.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit in which layers such as a field isolation region 2 , a gate electrode 4 , interlayer in sulating films 9, 11, 13, 15 and interconnection lines 10, 12, 14 are formed by the combined use of a lift off process and an ECR plasma deposition process. According to the present in vention, even if vertical dimensions of patterns of the respec tive layers are large as compared with their lateral dimensions, the upper surfaces of the respective layers can be planarized, permitting the fabrication of an LSI of high packing density, high operating speed and high reliability which is free from shorting and breakage of the interconnection lines.
