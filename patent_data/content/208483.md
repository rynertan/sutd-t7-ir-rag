## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for performing two and or three dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging, which imaging is based upon a function of the spin density distribution, the spin lattice relaxation time T₁ and the spin spin relaxation time T₂ of particular protons within a target. More specifically, the invention relates to a NMR imaging method and apparatus which eliminates an additional unknown phase factor which originates from basic field inhomogeneities and field drifts and from non perfect adjustment of electronic equipment. Atomic nuclei have net magnetic moments when placed in a static magnetic field, B Many different techniques are currently being investigated by which a characteristic image of a target, which might be part of a patient, can be effectively and efficiently obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging. Typically, the characteristic sought to be obtained is some function of the spin density distribution, the spin lattice relaxation time T₁ and the spin spin relaxation time T₂ of particular protons within the target. These protons are first excited by application of a magnetic field and a radio frequency RF pulse. Protons thus excited tend subsequently to relax, and during the process of relaxing generate a free induction decay FID signal. The above characteristic function of the relaxing protons within the target may be obtained by a Fourier transformation of this FID signal. By using the RF pulse chosen to have a selected frequency spectrum corresponding to the Larmor frequency of the protons given by the formula Imaging techniques utilizing NMR may typically be classified as imaging from projections, and direct mapping. The technique of imaging from projections i.e., projection reconstructions entails producing a multiplicity of projections from many different orientations by, for example, generating a linear field gradient within the object and recording a one dimensional projection of nuclear density in the direction defined by the gradient. An image is then reconstructed from the projections by mathematical techniques similar to those used X ray tomography. Such a method is described, for example, by Lauterbur, Direct mapping or Fourier imaging techniques generally employ an initial RF pulse to reorient the spins of the protons in the object by 90 . During the resultant FID signal, the object is subject to gradients applied consecutively in quick succession along the three principal Cartesian axes of the system. The FID and or spin echo signals are sampled, and a three dimensional Fourier transform is performed to develop a three dimensional image. Two dimensional Fourier transform methods are also known. In U.S. Patent No. 4,070,611, there is described a method of producing images by the Fourier NMR technique. A general discussion of various projection and direct mapping techniques may be found in Chapter 35 of The present invention is directed to a technique utilizing Fourier transformations with the production of images of samples. The spatial density distribution of these samples may be determined from the observed free induction decays FID s and or spin echoes of the sample in the presence of static magnetic fields and switched magnetic field gradients. The pulse sequence used to form an image by a Fourier based NMR imaging method is shown in Figure 1. A single plane is first selected by application of a narrow band 90 RF pulse and field gradient G The phase information in an NMR signal is preserved by employing two phase sensitive detectors in quadrature to produce two signals which are complex conjugate pairs. The two signals obtained after quadrature detection are written as follows after the Fourier transformation The function f x,y gives the spatial distributions. The spatial frequencies k However, in practice, there is added to the above ideal signal an additional unknown phase factor which originates from basic field inhomogeneities and field drifts and from non perfect electronics adjustment. Therefore, Eq. 1 can be rewritten as It is also noted in the case of use of the spin echo technique, there exists a point symmetry with respect to the point If the phase factor is considered in this method, Eq. 2 is defined as follows As understood from the above expression, it is not expected that one may shorten the sampling period for all desired sampling data by utilization of the point symmetry in the k The invention is directed to a method according to claim and an apparatus according to claim 5. To this end, a method in accordance with the invention is characterized in that a phase determination is made at an instant in time when the amount of phase encoding is zero and a phase correction is applied which corrects the phase error using the determined phase signal at another time when the amount of phase encoding is not zero. In accordance with the invention, by performing all of these corrections it is possible to detect the above described phase factor, and eliminate it such that the two data channels which are quadrature detected are in exact phase quadrature, the sampling period for imaging is shortened to about half, and, even though data acquisition is interrupted because of an external factor, an image may be formed from that obtained data. The invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the embodiments shown in the drawings therein Referring to FIG. 3, a target or object 2 to be investigated is placed in a static magnetic field B Three current generators 6, 6 and 10 are electrically connected for excitation of respective coils not shown to produce field gradients G The coil set 12 serving the purpose of excitation as well as reception of the signal, is connected to an arithmetic circuit 24 for performing a Fourier transformation via a high frequency signal detector 16, processing means such as an analog to digital convertor 18 phase detector 20, and phase corrector 22. Also for controlling the arrangement, additionally connections are provided between the high frequency signal generator 14 and a central control means or sequence controller 26 whose functions and relationships will be described in detail hereinafter. Central control means or sequence controller 26 is connected to phase detector 20, phase corrector 22 and arithmetic circuit 24. Before describing the method in accordance with the present invention for determining the nuclear magnetization distribution in the body 2, the principles of phase corrections will be explained in reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. As described above, phase detection is achieved by obtaining a phase shift ϑ using the signals obtained after quadrature detection the amount of phase encoding being zero, i.e., k When k To measure the spatial Fourier transform The absolute value Eq. 9 expresses that the absolute value of the spatial Fourier transformation The sequence controller 26 may comprise a programmable microprocessor programmed to sequence the mathematical steps indicated herein by providing control signals to components connected thereto. The mathematical steps themselves may be implemented using logic arrays incorporated within phase detector 20 and phase corrector 22. Alternately, phase detector 20 and phase corrector 22 may be fabricated using microprocessors or their function may be performed by the central processor of the sequence controller. In response to an instruction from the operation, the program sequence for a given phase correction sequence is entered. Figure 4 illustrates the function of the phase detector 20. As noted in FIG. 4, at step 40, the maximum value of the amplitude of the image wave is obtained, and then the spatial Fourier transformation Next, phase correction will be explained, in relation to the program sequence illustrated in FIG. 5. Following obtaining the phase shift 0, the sequence controller 26 operates to eliminate the phase shift O from the spatial Fourier transform in which As has already been stated, the points thus measured have conjugate relationship with those for k The method in accordance with the invention is not restricted to the half measurement of the rectangular k FIG. 6 depicts a pulse sequence used to obtain the measurement of the imaging data based upon the complex conjugate relationship, which is similar to FIG. 1, previously discussed, with the notable exception that in FIG. 6, the phase encoding gradient G An embodiment of a method in accordance with the invention will be described with reference to the FIGS. 3 and 6 8. Using the high frequency coil set 12, a 90 pulse is generated after the activation of the coil system 4 which generate the stationary homogeneous magnetic field B The collected usable samples are quadrature detected in the detector 16 in which the signal is mixed with a reference signal which generally has the same frequency W The phase corrected information is stored in a memory incorporated in the arithmetic circuit 24. FIG. 7 depicts a block diagram showing a circuit configuration of the arithmetic circuit 24. In FIG. 7, the signals after quadrature detection on the ith line in the k The two signals obtained after quadrature detection are separately stored in the memory 50 in a manner such that the real signals in the ith line of the k In accordance with the proposed method, as shown in FIG. 7 the double Fourier transformation is performed on the two signals after quadrature detection in the 2 D Fourier transformer 54. Another configuration of the arithmetic circuit 24 is shown in FIG. 8. After a 1 D Fourier transformation on the signals, in 1 D Fourier transformer 58, 1 D Fourier transformed signals are stored in a memory 60, via an inversion circuit 52 for storing real and imaginary components in a similar fashion as that shown in FIG. 7. By subsequently performing another 1 D Fourier transformation on the information read out of the memory 60 using 1 D Fourier transformer 64, the desired image will be reconstructed, and then displayed on the display 56 . In accordance with the modified method using one dimensional Fourier transformation process two separate times, the order of the sampling points in the memory 60 does not change. Such an arrangement makes for a simple control for storing the data into the memory 60. Even though the phase detector 20, phase corrector 22, the inversion circuits 52, and 52 , the memories 50 and 60, and the further Fourier transformers 54, 58, 64 have been described on the basis of discrete components, the same result can very well be obtained by utilizing a microprocessor which may be the same or different from that of the central control means 26. The memory means can be substituted by a magnetic disc memory system, and the 2 D Fourier transformation may be performed by using 1 D Fourier transformation two times.
