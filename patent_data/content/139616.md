# Bipolar electrolyzer having fixedly spaced apart electrodes.

## Abstract
A bipolar electrolyzer is provided which includes a plurality of bipolar electrode sub assemblies which position the electrodes in the cells in a manner such that improved electrical operating characteristics are achieved. Each bipolar electrode sub assembly includes an alternating stack of electrically insulating spacer members 76 and bipolar electrodes 54 . Electrodes are horizontally received in a channel 70,71 in the electrically insulating spacer members 76 which fixes the spaced relationship between juxtaposi tioned anodes and cathodes.
