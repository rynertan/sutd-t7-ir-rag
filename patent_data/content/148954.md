# APPARATUS FOR GUIDING WIRE ELECTRODE OF WIRE CUT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINE.

## Abstract
An apparatus for guiding a wire electrode of a wire cut electric discharge machine makes it possible to improve the linearity of the wire electrode and the machining accuracy thereof, and enables an easy changeover of the wire electrode between two modes, a mode in which the wire electrode is used for both tapered machining and non tapered machining and a mode in which the wire electrode is used exclusively for non tapered machining. The apparatus comprises a V groove guide unit 15 which is constituted by a combination of a V groove guide 2 for guiding a machining wire electrode 1 and a machining fluid supply means 10 , and a die type guide unit 11 which is remov ably attached to the lower surface of the V groove guide unit 15 and whicn is constituted by a combination of a die type guide 3 which guides the machining wire electrode 1 and a machining fluid injection nozzle 12 with a flow path which communicates with the machining fluid supply means 10 and surrounds the die type guide 3 , or a machining fluid nozzle unit 13 which is provided with a longitudinal hollow space 14 which constitutes a flow path acting both an outlet path of the machining wire electrode 1 and a machining fluid injection nozzle communicating with the machining fluid supply means 10 .
