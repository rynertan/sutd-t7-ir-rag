# Method for growing multicomponent compound semiconductor crystals.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are proposed for growing crystals of an at least three component compound semicon ductor from its growth solution, in which at least one source material 5 containing at least one solute element is im mersed and dissolved in the growth solution 2 by conduct ing DC electric current from a current supplying electrode 3 immersed in the growth solution through the growth solution to the source material s , and thus a desired com position of the growth solution can be constantly main tained. As a result, the composition of the grown crystals of the multicomponents compound semiconductor can be also controlled to a desired proportion.
