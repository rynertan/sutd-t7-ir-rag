# A test procedure for testing an internal combustion engine electronic ignition system.

## Abstract
A test apparatus for testing internal combustion engine spark ignition systems includes input terminals 20, 21 for connection across the electronic switch 13a of the ignition system under test. A plurality of comparators 30, 31 und 32 are connected to compare the voltage across the input terminals with different reference levels and the comparator outputs are connected via peak storge circuits to a logic circuit which drives indicators 56, 57, 59, 60 indicating various fault conditions.
