# Optical disc structure and related method of manufacture.

## Abstract
An optical disc structure including two resilient disc members 10,12 which are bonded together adjacent their outer peripheries 20 and which include an air channel 30 allowing communication between the chamber 22 formed between the discs 10,12 and the atmosphere. An informa tion layer 24,24 is formed on the inner surface of at least one of the members 10,12 . When the members 10,12 are spun, a pressure differential is caused tending to push the two members 10,12 apart, thereby assuring that one member 10 will not contact the information 24 layer formed on the other member 12 and that the two members 10,12 will not be close enough together to cause optical interference.
