# Improved polarizing of material.

## Abstract
Electrically polarizable material 12 , e.g. PVDP film is poled by appliyng an electric field across the film. Insulation is provided on the surface of the film. In a typical embodi ment a compliant dielectric annulus 10 insulates the polar ized region from the edges of the film. This substantially eli minates breakdown at the edges of the film, allowing in creased poling voltages. The technique can reduce poling time to typically a few seconds at room temperature, as compared to minutes or hours by prior art techniques, some of which required elevated temperatures.
