# Conductivity modulation type semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A conductivity modulation type semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor anode substrate 33 of a P type having two surfaces, a semiconductor substrate 31 of an N type having two surfaces, the semiconductor substrate hav ing a high impurity layer like region 32 on one surface thereof and a low concentration drain region on the other surface thereof, a body region 37 of P type formed in the drain region and exposed at one surface of the semiconduc tor substrate, source regions 38 of an N type formed in the body region and exposed at the other surface of the semi conductor substrate, and a gate layer 36 formed within the insulating layer, which extends between the source and drain regions, on the body region. The other surface of the anode substrate is polished and is intimately joined to the polished surface of the semiconductor substrate to form a junction layer therebetween.
