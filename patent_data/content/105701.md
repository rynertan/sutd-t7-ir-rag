## Description
DRAWING LAMINATED POLARIZING GLASSES AND INFRARED POLARIZING GLASSES MADE THEREBY Polarizing glasses have been prepared wherein very fine metallic particles and inorganic crystals have comprised the polarizing materials. Three methods for making polarizing glasses have been disclosed in the recent patent literature. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,125,404 and 4,125,405 describe the preparation of photochromic and non photochromic polarizing glasses effected through the irradiation of silver containing glasses with intense polarized light. Photochromic polarizing glasses are generally clear in the undarkened state and polarizing in the darkened state. U.S. Patents Nos.3,653,863 and 4,282,022 disclose the manufacture of photochromic polarizing glasses via elongating, stretching or extruding the glass. U.S. Patent No.4,304,584 describes the preparation of polarizing glasses by elongating glasses containing silver halide particles, then heat treating said glass in a reducing atmosphere. The first method involves subjecting a glass, wherein a silver halide selected from the group ofAgCl, AgBr, and AgI constitutes the polarizing agent, to a high intensity source of linearly polarized visible light, such as a laser, while the glass is in the darkened or colored state. The practical aspects of providing such an exposure to the glass have rendered the process intrinsically expensive and slow.Furthermore, the polarizing effect produced in this manner deteriorates on exposure to sunlight and the reported dichroic ratios are relatively low, 4. The second method is specifically directed to photochromic glasses wherein a silver halide comprises the photochromic agent. The technique contemplates stretching or extruding the photochromic glasses, while at temperatures between the annealing and softening points of the glass, to simultaneously elongate the silver halide particles to an ellipsoidal configuration conventionally demonstrating a length to width ratio, termed the aspect ratio , ranging between about 2 1 5 1 for stretching and 2 1 30 1 for extrusion and align the elongated particles. The elongated glass is cooled quickly to inhibit the elongated particles from returning to their original shape respheroidizing . The stretching technique 3,653,863 is subject to several limitations. For example, the redrawing or stretching comprehends placing the glass under high tensile stress, and glass is known to be weak in tension. Consequently, although we have found that the stress necessary for good particle elongation is often at least about 3000 6000 psi, ruptures of the glass at much lower stress levels are not uncommon. A practical limit for rupture is considered to be about 1000 psi. U.S. Patent No. 4,282,022 discloses a method of extruding silver containing glasses wherein the metallic silver and or silver halide particles within the glass are elongated and aligned in the direction of glass movement. In general, the silver and silver halide particles, prior to elongation, have diameters within the range of about 80 1000 A. The patent points out that if the extrusion process is founded essentially solely upon the presence of compressive stresses, and glass is known to be extremely strong under compression, extrusion can be carried out at very high compressive stress levels. This factor eliminates the problem of premature rupture which is encountered when applying the necessary stretching tensile stresses during a redraw operation.Thus, superior polarizing characteristics theoretically can be obtained with an extrusion process, since extrusion permits the use of higher stress levels. The extrusion is conducted at such elevated temperatures that the glass is at a viscosity of between 10 101 poises, i.e., at temperatures between about the annealing point and the softening point of the glass, and at such pressures that the cross sectional area of the glass in the extrusion chamber is reduced by a factor of at least 4 and up to 80 or more in the extrudate. Under the influence of those temperatures and pressures the silver and or silver halide particles will be elongated to assume an oblate or prolate geometry with aspect ratios of at least 2 1 and up to 30 1 and greater. The photochromic glasses are also generally clear in the undarkened state and polarizing in the darkened state, while the glasses containing silver metal are always polarizing. However, various problems are encountered with the extrusion process including a tendency for the elongated particles to return to their original shape respheroidize as the glass flows from the extrusion chamber, unless necessary precautions are taken. In addition, the flow of a charge in an extrusion chamber is not uniform, since the center portion thereof tends to flow more rapidly than the portion closer to the chamber and orifice walls, due to the friction of such walls. United States Patent No. 4,304,584 describes the production of glasses exhibiting polarizing properties, i.e., glasses displaying dichroic ratios up to 40 and higher, from two types of silver containing glasses 1 phase separable glasses and 2 glasses demonstrating photochromic behavior because of the presence of particles of a silver halide selected from the group of AgCl, AgBr, and AgI.The method for preparing the polarizing glasses contemplates two fundamental steps a step a elongating or stretching the base glass articles under stress via such methods as redrawing, extruding, rolling, or stretching at temperatures between the annealing point and softening point of the glasses to cause the glass phases in the phase separable glasses or the silver halide particles in the photochromic glasses to become elongated and aligned in the direction of the stress and b heat treating the elongated glass articles in a reducing environment at a temperature below the annealing point of the glasses, but above about 3000C, to reduce at least a portion of the silver ions in the glass to metallic silver which is deposited in at least one of the elongated glass phases and or along the phase boundaries of the elongated glass phases and or deposited upon the elongated silver halide particles.The most efficient heat treatment is stated to comprise a temperature between about 3750 4500C in a hydrogen atmosphere. Polarization was discerned in the visible and near infrared portions of the radiation spectrum.When photochromic glasses are made polarizing in this manner the non reduced particles in the bulk of the glass retain their photochromic properties. In the case of phase separable, non photochromic glasses, the operable compositions are asserted to reside in the alkali metal aluminoborosilicate field.Thus, suitable glasses will commonly consist essentially, in weight percent, of about 5 12 alkali metal oxide, 20 35 B203, 1 15 A1203, and the remainder SiO2, but with the proviso that, where Al2O3 is included in amounts in excess of 5 , a specific phase separation agent such as CdO and or F must be present at a level of at least 1 . The base composition of an operable photochromic glass is noted as being essentially immaterial so long as AgCl and or AgBr and or AgI constitute the photochromic agents, although large amounts, viz., 10 by weight total, of PbO and or other readily reducible metal oxides will be avoided. The patent also discloses the production of composite bodies formed via concurrent extrusion of different glass compositions, that practice being operable with both phase separable glasses and photochromic glasses. In general, the composite body will consist of a thin surface layer or skin enveloping a thicker interior portion or core. Thus, with respect to silver halide containing photochromic glasses, it had been recognized in the art that the subjection of such glasses to high temperatures led to the growth of relatively large silver halide particles, the dimensions of the particles becoming so large as to cause light scattering with the consequent development of a hazy appearance. It was found, however, that the larger particles required less mechanical stress to effect elongation thereof and resisted the tendency to respheroidize to a much greater extent. Accordingly, it was deemed useful to form a laminated article comprising a thin skin glass which has been subjected to a relatively high heat treatment to generate large silver halide crystals therein and an interior portion that has been subjected to a less severe heat treatment to produce a transparent photochromic glass.Subsequent elongation of the composite body results in a thin skin exhibiting high polarization and a transparent core displaying good photochromic behavior.And, because the cross section of the skin glass is very thin, any haze developed therein will customarily have very little effect upon the optical transmission of the composite. As can be appreciated, inasmuch as the polarization derived from the heat treatment conducted under reducing conditions is normally limited to a thin surface layer, typically 10 100 microns, the phase separable or photochromic glass need only comprise the surface layer of the composite, if so desired Hence, the use of composite articles lends even wider versatility to the process. For example, only the skin layer is required to be elongated uniformly the size, shape, and alignment of the particles in the core glass have little effect upon the polarization character of the final product. Furthermore, the production of laminated articles is economically attractive inasmuch as only the thin surface layer need include the relatively expensive silver containing materials. That patented procedure was shown to produce excellent polarization in the visible portion of the radiation spectrum with values there for being reported at 550nm and 600nm, those wavelengths lying near the center of the visible region of the spectrum. For certain applications, however, it would be desirable to have glasses that exhibit good polarizing character in the infrared area of the spectrum, i.e., at wavelengths longer than 700nm. The currently available sheet type and wire grid polarizers often display poor performances over the wavelengths between 700nm 3000nm because of their poor polarizing properties and or poor chemical, mechanical, or thermal durability. It is apparent that the patent was concerned with the utilization of relatively large silver halide particles within a thin skin glass of a composite body, since the large particles required less mechanical stress to effect the elongation thereof and further, since such particles resisted the tendency to respheroidize. However, we have observed that higher dichroic ratios of greater than 15 1 and even exceeding 60 1, representing increased polarization, are obtainable by elongating relatively small silver particles having a diameter of less than about 500A.Further, we have learned that it is necessary to utilize particles having a diameter of less than about o o SOOA and preferably less than 200A in order to eliminate the effects of light scattering, which is produced by larger particles, and which cannot be tolerated in many optical and ophthalmic applications. We have further learned that if the particles are in the form of silver halide, haze levels suitable for optical and ophthalmic applications can be achieved if the particle sizes are less than 200A in diameter.Also, dichroic ratios in excess of 40 can be achieved when silver halide particles less than 600A diameter are elongated and reduced to silver metal by heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere. One problem, however, encountered with the utilization of such smaller particles of 500A or less, is the fact that higher stresses, often greater than 10,000 psi, are required to elongate such particles to a degree necessary to provide the desired high dichroic ratio, which may be on the order of 40 or greater. In contrast, normal redraw operations may be performed under stresses of less than 1000 psi, and when the stress is increased about 1500 psi the glass has a tendency .to rupture or break during the redraw process. It thus has been an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of drawing or redrawing glass having silver or silver halide o O particles of less than about 500A or 200A, respectively, with tensile stresses of greater than 2500 psi so as to elongate said silver or silver halide particles, hereinafter called silver containing particles, without rupturing or breaking the glass draw. Another objective of the instant invention is to produce glasses demonstrating excellent polarizing properties over the infrared portion of the radiation spectrum, most preferably the region of 700 3000nm.Polarizing properties up to the long wavelength transmission cutoff of the base glass, i.e., in the region of 3 5 microns, are, however, within the scope of the invention. In its simplest form, the present invention sets forth a method of making polarizing glasses having high dichroic ratios by drawing glass having relatively small silver containing particles under relatively high stress and elongating such particles during the drawing process without rupturing the glass draw. In view of the fact that breakage or rupture of the draw is usually the result of a concentration of tensile stresses adjacent to a surface flaw, the potentially polarizing glass is coated with a glass of substantially lower viscosity so that during the elongation process, very little tensile stress will exist at the surface of the draw, thereby virtually eliminating such breakage. Referring now to the drawings, and particularlyFig. 1, a schematic illustration of a glass drawing process embodying the present invention is shown. Although the drawing process is shown with respect to a redraw blank, the drawing and stretching of the laminated polarizing glasses is equally applicable to the drawing of molten laminated polarizing glasses emanating from a composite glass feeder such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,582,306 or laminated sheet glass formers disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.4,204,027 and 4,214,886. The redraw blank 10 is shown comprising a potentially polarizing core glass 12 and a skin glass 14. The blank 10 passes through a hot zone of a redraw furnace represented by arrow 16, wherein the blank is heated and stretched under tension by pulling rolls 18 into a laminated polarizing glass sheet or strip 20. During the drawing process, the skin glass temperature is generally maintained near or above its softening point temperature until the glass is contacted by the pulling rolls 18, to thus ensure that very little tensile stress exists in the skin layer.The core glass, which is subjected to high tensile stress during the drawing process, so as to elongate the silver containing particles to a desired aspect ratio of 2 1 or greater, is maintained at a temperature above its annealing point temperature. However, the high tensile stresses in the core glass are not permitted to be transmitted to the traditionally weak glass air interface, due to the presence of the low viscosity skin glass, except for the very short period of time that the glass surface is in contact with the pulling rolls. The stress of stretching no longer exists within the strip 20 below the pulling rolls 18, and accordingly the low viscosity skin glass may then harden. When working with redraw blanks, an additional benefit is obtained through the use of a low viscosity skin glass. That is, as previously mentioned, most glass breakage during drawing is the result of high tensile stresses about surface flaws, however as the skin glass passes through the hot zone of a redraw furnace, or is delivered in a molten state in a downdraw, the skin glass is sufficiently fluid so as to heal over any core glass surface flaws which may be present from the fabrication or handling of a redraw blank or due to imperfections in a discharge orifice.If it is desired to produce a strengthened polarizing glass, the softer skin glass may be made of a lower expansion than that of the core glass. Further, if the finish of the laminated sheet is important, the skin glass could be hardened above the pulling rolls so that its surface would not be marked by the rolls, and if a lower expansion skin glass were used any tensile stress at the surface would be at least partially counteracted by the compression stress arising from the difference in the expansion coefficients between the skin and the core glasses. The thickness of the low viscosity skin glass may be varied to provide various desired properties. From the point of view of reducing surface stress at the pulling rolls, the ratio of core thickness to total laminated thickness, B, should be small, preferably less than 1 10 or t B c 1 10 t where B is the ratio of the core thickness to the total laminated thickness, t is the thickness of the core, c and tl is the total laminate thickness. When B is a relatively low value, a close thermal expansion match between the core and skin glass is required to maintain low residual tensile stress in the core glass, which is necessary to avoid spontaneous breakage in the final product during use.On the other hand, at relatively high B values, larger thermal expansion mismatches may be tolerated and in fact can be used to provide surface compressive stress for strengthening the product. To illustrate how the laminated article materially reduces the overall tensile stress in the article during stretching while still maintaining relatively high tensile stress in the core for elongating the silver containing particles, one can envision a polarizing sheeting having a 0.002 thick silver containing core glass and skin glasses have a thickness of 0.010 each, thus giving an overall sheet thickness of 0.022 . If the laminated ribbon were 111 wide and the stress necessary for particle elongation were 4000 psi, then the force necessary to stretch only the core would 0.002 x 1 x 4000 which equals 8 Ibs. Accordingly, if the skin glass viscosity is 1000 times less than the core glass, the force to stretch the two skin layers would only be 0.020 1 0,002 x 1000 0.08 lbs. If the skin glass were hardened before passing through the pulling rolls, the tensile stress in the hardened glass ribbon at that point would be 8.08 367.3psi 0.022 x 1 Therefore, utilizing the concept of the present invention, a stress of 4000 psi is produced in the polarizing glass while producing only a 367 psi stress at potential breakage sites at the surface of the low viscosity skin glass. Perhaps almost as importantly, however, the process is capable of producing excellent polarizing sheet using very low pulling forces at the pulling rolls.For example, under the above described conditions of core and skin glass thickness and relative viscosities, a 60 wide polarizing sheet could be drawn with a pulling force of 60 x 8.08 or only 485 libs. compared to 5,280 lbs. if the core glass occupied the entire sheet thickness. Thus, it is entirely feasible that such forces could be used in producing laminated polarizing sheet glass from molten downdraw and overflow sheet forming apparatus in a continuous process. Fig. 2 illustrates viscosity curves of two skin glasses S1 and S2 that could be used with a core glass C1 which contains silver particles. The skin glass S2 has almost the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the silver particle containing core glassC1, but is softer by a factor of about 1000 at its own softening temperature. The skin glass S1 would provide strengthening to the core glass C1 since its coefficient of thermal expansion is about 30 less than that of the core glass C1.The viscosity of the low viscosity skin glass at the softening point temperature of the core glass should be at least 50 less than that of the core glass so that the tensile stresses during drawing and elongation of the laminated glass will be minimal in the skin glass while sufficiently large in the core glass so as to elongate the silver containing particles to an aspect ratio of at least 2 1 and preferably greater. Preferably, from the point of view of concentrating the particle elongation load in the core glass and minimizing glass surface stress during redraw, it is desirable that the skin to body viscosity ratio measured at the softening point of the body glass be equal to or less than 10 . That is nS 2 5 nb wherein n5 is the viscosity of the skin glass and nb is the viscosity of the body or core glass. The required ratio will depend on both the redraw stress required and the surface stress that can be tolerated. Virtually any glass containing silver metal particles may be made polarizing if it is stretched at a temperature near its softening point i.e., n 10 7 to 10 10 poises with sufficient tensile stress to elongate the particles. Also, most photochromic glasses containing silver halide can be made polarizing in either their photolytically darkened or hydrogen reduced states by similar processing. As previously mentioned, higher dichroic ratios are obtained when the silver particles are relatively small with a diameter of 500 or less. However, the elongation of such particles requires the stretching of a glass under stresses exceeding 2500 psi, and often greater than 10,000 psi, and thus the laminated glass of the present invention facilitates the application of such stresses without breakage of the glass during drawing.The dichroic ratio DR is defined in the following formula DR Log 1 Log liT1 wherein DR is the dichroic ratio, T11 is the transmission of the glass for linearly polarized light with its electric vector oriented parallel to the glass stretch axis and Tj is the transmission of the glass with a perpendicular orientation. Utilizing relatively small silver particles and elongating the same with the present invention to an aspect ratio of 2 1 or greater, dichroic ratios at the absorption peak exceeding 60 are possible. As previously mentioned, the essence of the invention is to provide a means for protecting the surface of the polarizing glass while it is being stretched, by encasing or cladding the potentially, polarizing core glass with a much softer skin glass. Although virtually any softer skin glass would provide the desired beneficial results in accordance with this invention with any core glass having silver containing particles, preferably the coefficient of expansion of the skin and core glasses are matched to prevent the development of residual stress when the polarizing glass is cooled to room temperature.However, a compressive stress in the cladding may be utilized to provide some strength benefit in certain product applications. The following table sets forth illustrations of specific core and skin glasses which may be utilized in accordance with this invention. TABLE I Polarizing Polarizing Core Glass Core Glass wt.

A core glass having a composition as set forth as C2 in the above table was provided with a skin glass of a composition set forth as S2 in said table, to form a redraw blank. The blank was comprised of a core having a thickness of 0.112 and a width of about 2 1 2 surrounded by the skin glass having a thickness of 0.125 .The redraw blank was heated to the softening point temperature of the core glass which produced a viscosity of 5x107P whereas the skin glass had a viscosity at such temperature of 3x106P which is 16.7 times less than that of the core glass. The core was subjected to a pulling load and drawn down into a laminated polarizing glass strip at a tensile stress of about 9,600 PSI. j The silver containing particles were initially about 380A in diameter and were elongated to an aspect ratio of 2.9 1, and the resulting product produced a polarizing glass having a dichroic ratio of 37 measured at 630 nm . Electron microscopy and X ray diffraction analysis have demonstrated that silver halide particles are reduced to silver metal when a glass containing such particles is subjected to a heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere. However, the silver metal occupies a smaller volume than the precursor silver halide particle and exhibits a lower aspect ratio.Therefore, the aspect ratio of the silver halide particles must be greater than twice and, preferably, at least thrice that desired in the silver metal particles to achieve the sought for polarization. Fundamentally, the means for accomplishing the above cited principal objective contemplates four general steps 1 a batch for a glass containing silver and at 16least one halide selected from the group of chloride, bromide, an iodide is melted and the melt shaped into a glass body of a desired configuration 2 the glass body is subjected to a defined heat treatment to cause the generation of silver halide particles therein of a desired size 3 the glass body is elongated under stress within a defined temperature range to elongate said silver halide particles and to align them in the direction of the stress and 4 the elongated glass body is exposed to a reducing environment within a defined temperature range to reduce at least a portion of the silver halide particles to elemental or metallic silver which is deposited in and or upon said elongated particles. The observance of the heat treating parameters of each of Steps 2 , 3 , and 4 is vital to achieving the desired properties in the final product. To illustrate, the generation of silver halide particles in the glass body required temperatures above the strain point preferably above the annealing point, and, where physical support is provided for the glass body as, for example, confinement in a mold, temperatures 50 C in excess of the softening point of the glass can be utilized. Temperatures above the annealing point are economically desirable since, as is well recognized in the art, particle growth occurs more rapidly as the temperature is raised, provided the maximum solubility temperature of the particles is not exceeded. The elongation of the glass body and the silver halide particles previously generated therein will be conducted at temperatures above the annealing point but below the softening point of the glass, i.e., at temperatures where the glass exhibits a viscosity greater than 108 poises. In general, the elongation will be carried out at temperatures at least 500C below the softening point, to allow high stresses to be developed and to prevent respheroidization of the particles. Laboratory experimentation has demonstrated that silver halide particles can be elongated at lower stresses than silver metal particles and yet will provide excellent polarization properties after reduction to elemental or metallic silver.Although not unequivocally proven, the reason for this behavior of silver halide particles vis a vis silver particles is believed to be twofold first, because the glass silver halide particle interface has a lower surface tension than the glass silver metal interface and, second, because the silver halide entity is larger than the corresponding amount of elemental silver and, hence, exhibits less surface curvature and, therefore, less surface tension generated pressure, with the necessary consequence that it stretches more easily,Evidence supporting that reasoning is found in the fact that elongated metallic silver particles are subject to respheroidization at temperatures about the strain point of a glass, whereas elongated silver halide particles resist respheroidization to higher temperatures. Nevertheless, firing of the elongated body in a reducing environment will be carried out at temperatures above about 2500C but no higher than 25 C above the annealing point and, preferably, somewhat below the annealing point of the glass to again preclude any tendency of the particles to respheroidize. Thus, to repeat, the elongated configuration of the silver and silver halide particles is quite unstable and even the slightest relaxation in the residual glass matrix will permit the particles to move toward their stable state. Glass relaxation is essentially absent at temperatures below the strain point thereof. The particle elongation can be deemed permanent at such low temperatures. In a similar manner to the disclosure of PatentNo. 4,304,584, the process parameters of the instant invention are applicable with any glass which is characterized as containing silver halide particles therein selected from the group of AgCl, AgBr, and AgI, whether or not the glass evidences photochromic behavior. Patent No. 4,304,584 refers to United StatesPatent No. 3,208,860,the basic patent in the field of photochromic glass. That patent broadly discloses silicate based glass compositions which display photochromic behavior because of the presence of silver halide crystals therein selected from the group ofAgCl, AgBr, and AgI.The preferred glass compositions cited in the patent consisted essentially, expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis, of 40 76 SIZE, 4 26 Al203, 4 26 B2 and at least one alkali metal oxide selected from the group of 2 88 Li2O, 4 15 Na2O, 6 20 K20, 8 25 Rub20, and 10 30 Cs2O, at least one halogen in the indicated minimum proportion of 0.2 Cl, 0.1 Br, and 0.08 I, and a minimum of Ag in the indicated proportion of 0.2 where the halogen is Cl, 0.05 in a glass containing at least 0.1 Br, and 0.03 in a glass containing at least 0,or I, the sum of the base glass components, silver, and halogen constituting at least 85 of the total glass. Besides the above recited required components, the patent discloses the optional inclusion of fluorine, bivalent metal oxides such as CaO, SrO, MgO,BaO, and ZnO, and P205. The present inventive process is operable with such glass compositions, provided that substantial amounts of readily reducible metal oxides such as PbO and by203 are not present therein.Where the inventive products are destined for use in ophthalmic applications, i.e., there is a desired for a glass demonstrating rapid fading capability and relative independence to changes in temperature, the preferred photochromic glasses are those described in United States Patent No. 4,190,451 which consist essentially, expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis, of 8 20 R2O, whereinR2O consists of 0 2.5 Li2O, 0 9 Na2O, 0 17 K2O, and 0 6 Cos20 14 23 B2O3, 5 258 2 A1203, 0 258 P205, 20 65 SiO2, 0.004 0.02 CuO, 0.15 0.3 Ag, 0.1 0.258 Cl, and 0.1 0 2 Br, the molar ratio R2O B203 ranging between about 23 0.55 0.85, where the composition is essentially free from divalent metal oxides other than CuO, and the weight ratio Ag Cl Br ranging about 0.65 0.95.Self evidently, however, there are applications for photochromic glasses other than in the ophthalmic field where slower fading, and or deeper darkening, and or strong temperature dependence can be tolerated or which may actually be desirable. Such glasses are also included in the present inventive process.Furthermore, where, as here, polarization in the infrared portion of the radiation spectrum, rather than the visible region, is of prime importance, the development of haze in the visible region of the spectrum is of no moment. Accordingly, where ophthalmic properties are not demanded, a preferred range of glasses will include those described in PatentNo. 4,190,451, supra, but wherein the R2O content varies about 6 20 . As is well known to the art, the actinic radiation promoting photochromic behavior in silver halide containing glasses lies in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. It has been found that the dichroic ratio and, hence, the polarization performance are somewhat decreased when a polarizing photochromic glass darkens in the presence of ultraviolet radiation. In the above described preferred range of photochromic glass compositions, copper performs as a sensitizing agent i.e., the glass will contain silver halide crystals but will display essentially no photochromic character in the absence of copper or with very high levels of copper, i.e., in excess of 2 by weight copper. Accordingly, where photochromism is not desired, copper will generally be omitted from the glass composition or utilized only at a very low level, since excessive amounts of copper disadvantageously color the glass. Nonetheless, when copper is entirely absent from the composition, care must be exercised during melting of the batch ingredients to avoid reduction of the silver ions to metallic silver.Thus, for example, alkali metal oxides may be added to the batch as nitrates or other techniques well known to the glass technologist may be used to maintain oxidizing conditions. Also, as a general rule, easily reducible metal oxides such as PbO and Bi 203 will be avoided to preclude their possible reduction along with the silver ions during the heat treatment in the reducing environment. This situation would lead to a broadening of the silver peak and a decrease in dichroic ratio.One especially desirable glass of the former type has the following composition, expressed in terms of parts by weight on the oxide basis Si 2 57.9 B2O3 18.9 A12 3 6.27 Na2O 4.13 Li2O 1.84 K2O 5.79 2 5.05 Ag 0.25 Cl 0.226 Br 0.14 Inasmuch as the sum of the above components closely approximates 100, for all practical purposes the individual values may be considered to reflect weight percent. It was observed in Patent No. 4,190,451 that maintaining the molar ratio R20 Al 203 B 203 at a low level causes the glass to exhibit little photochromic darkening. Accordingly, another composition regime wherein silver halide crystals can be developed, but the glass will not demonstrate significant photochromism even when copper is present, lies in the region of glasses wherein the molar ratio R2O Al2O3 B2O3 0.25, although the addition of at least 0.01 by weight CdO may promote photochromism. Yet another area of compositions containing silver halide crystals, but which will not display significant photochromic behavior even when copper is included, involves glasses having base compositions with greater than 26 by weight B2O3 In general, such base glasses will consist essentially, expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis, of about 5 12 alkali metal oxides, 1 15 Awl203, 27 35 B2O3, and the remainder SiO2, and wherein the molar ratio R2O Al2O3 B2O3 is most preferably less than 0.25. Again, the addition of CdO in an amount of at least 0.01 may cause the development of photochromism.A particularly desirable example of such a glass has the composition recited below, literally expressed in terms of parts by weight on the oxide basis, but which may, for all practical purposes, be deemed to be stated in terms of weight percent SiO2 51.8 B,O3 31.0 Al203 7.8 Na2O 9.8 Ag 0.18 Cl 0.52 Br 1.2 F 1.2 CuO 0.03 Experience has indicated that the silver halide particles developed during the initial heat treatment prior to elongation should exhibit diameters of at least about 200 in order to assume, upon elongation, aspect ratios of at least 5 1 such that, upon reduction to elemental silver particles, those latter particles will display aspect ratios greater than 2 1 to insure the placement of the long wavelength peak at least near the edge of the infrared portion of the radiation spectrum, while avoiding serious breakage problems during the elongation process. Conversely, the diameters of the initial particles ought not to exceed about 5000 , lest the body exhibit considerable translucency and a decreased dichroic ratio due to radiation scattering effects. The following table records a number of glass compositions, expressed in terms of parts by weight on the oxide basis, to illustrate the inventive method.Because the total of the individual constituents closely approximates 100, for all practical purposes the tabulated values can be deemed to reflect weight percent Inasmuch as it is not know with which cation s the halogens are combined, they are simply reported as halides, in accordance with conventional glass analysis practice. Finally, because the quantities of silver employed are so small, they are merely listed as Ag. The actual batch ingredients may comprise any materials, either the oxides or other compounds, which, when melted in combination with the other components, will be converted into the desired oxide in the proper proportions. The batch components were compounded, ballmilled together to assist in obtaining a homogeneous melt, and either charged into platinum crucibles or into a small laboratory continuous melting unit. The batches were melted at about 13000 14500C, the melts cast as bars having dimensions of about 2.5 x 0.25 x 18 , drawn as sheet having a width of about 8 and a thickness of about 0.375 , or cast as cylindrical bars with a diameter of about 2.5 and a length of 10 , and those bodies annealed at about 4500C. Table II also reports the photochromic behavior PC of the compositions.

TableIII also records the elongation process applied to specimens of each glass via redrawing, including the temperature of redrawing, the stress applied in psi and the average aspect ratio demonstrated by the elongated particles, again as determined via electron microscopy. The reducing treatment was carried out on ground and polished specimens cut from the elongated bars and sheets in a laboratory furnace fitted with a stainless steel tube through which an appropriate gas can be passed. Because of the well recognized inherent superiority of hydrogen as a reducing environment, it was utilized in the described studies. Nonetheless, it will be appreciated that other well known reducing atmospheres such as cracked ammonia, combinations of CO and CO2, and mixtures of hydrogen with other gases, for example, forming gas, will similarly be effective, although customarily requiring a longer exposure period than with hydrogen gas to secure the same effect. In general, the elongated articles will be exposed to the reducing atmosphere for a sufficient period of time to develop a reduced surface layer having a thickness of at least 10 microns and, preferably, about 50 microns to0.002 . Table III also lists the time and temperature of the reduction treatment to which the elongated samples were subjected.

This pressure cannot be directly compared with the drawing stress of Table III since there is a stress gradient which decreases to 0 at the exit of the extrusion die.Again, electron microscopy was utilized to measure the average diameter of the particles and the average aspect ratio demonstrated by them. Table IV also lists the temperature and time of the reduction treatment to which the elongated specimens were subjected, a hydrogen atmosphere again constituting the reducing environment.
