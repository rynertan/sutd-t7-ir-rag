# Method for improving the electrical conductivity of a steel surface having a coating of ferrous oxide.

## Abstract
The electrical conductivity of metal surfaces, particularly steel surfaces of plates of electrostatic precipitators, may be regenerated by treating the surface with a regenerating agent in the form of a hyrogen halide such as hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen halide may be utilized in either liquid, gaseous or vaporous form. If so desired, an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride may also be used to enhance the regenerative powers of the hydrogen halide. For exam ple, the surface of steel may be treated with hydrogen chloride and ammonium chloride to enhance the formation of ferric oxide which possesses a greater electrical conduc tivity than does ferrous oxide.
