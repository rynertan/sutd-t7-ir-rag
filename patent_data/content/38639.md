# A circuit for detecting unbalance of the traction current in a track circuit.

## Abstract
In order to prevent a false signal being given in a circuit arrangement for detecting the presence of rolling stock on a track section, when a rail is earthed or fractured, a detecting circuit 31 is provided for detecting unbalance of the traction current. The unbalance detecting circuit is for association with a transmitter 20 for transmitting a track circuit current and an associated receiver 21 . The unbalance detecting circuit has two current sensors TA which are connected to the ends of the rails 1,2 adjacent to the receiver 21 for transmitting the respective signals to the unbalance detecting circuit 31 , and the unbalance detecting circuit transmits the track circuit signal to the receiver only when the signals detected by the current sensors are equal or when their difference is such as not to cause undue excitation of the receiver, and a pole change switch 30 for connection between the track circuit current transmitter and the ends of the rails associated there with.
