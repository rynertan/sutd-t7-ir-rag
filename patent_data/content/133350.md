# RMS converters.

## Abstract
An RMS converter has first and second transistors 40a and 42a providing a signal representing double the log of the input voltage, a third transistor 40b , matched with the first 40a , providing a signal representative of the log of the output voltage and a fourth transistor 42b , matched with the second 42a , providing a signal representative of the anti log of the ratio of those signals the transistors in each matched pair are repetitively interchanged functionally thereby reducing errors caused by slight differences in the transistor operating charac teristics.
