# PRESSURE OPERATED DOOR ACTUATOR

## Abstract
A pneumatic door actuator in which an actuator rod 5 is driven by a piston 1 working within a cylinder 2 , opposite ends 3, 4 of which are selectively pressurised and vented to provide motive effort for the piston 1 . If a closing door is temporarily obstructed the pressure in the vented end 3 of the cylinder 2 may drop sufficiently to cause the door to be slammed shut when the obstruction is removed. The approp riate cylinder end 3 is thus vented through a valve 14 which is unseated when the difference between the pressure remaining in the cylinder and the exhaust port vent 11 exceeds a predetermined level. When this pressure differ ence falls the valve 14 closes trapping the remaining pressure so that it acts as a cushion when piston movement is resumed.
