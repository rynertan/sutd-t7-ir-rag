# A periscopic sight.

## Abstract
A periscopic sight 11, 13, 14 is mounted to extend through the wall of protective armour 23 surrounding a gun station. An elevation mirror 11 is exposed to receive light from the direction in which the gun is pointing and to reflect the light along a vertical path extending through the sight. A sealed unitary lens system 13 has a lens axis aligned with the vertical path and conducts the light there through to a stationary mirror 14 accessible to the eye 16 of an observer. The sealed unitary lens systems has a sufficiently long eye relief to provide an unobstructed image to the observer in spite of the placement of the stationary mirror 14 between the lens system 13 and the observer 16 .
