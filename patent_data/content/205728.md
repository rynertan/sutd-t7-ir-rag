## Description
The present invention relates to an arrangement of input output I O pins for an integrated circuit IC . There is a class of integrated circuits such as charge coupled device CCD in which the operation of the circuit is controlled based on the fundamental high frequency clock signals that are received by the circuit. In such a circuit, the signal that is needed for the operation of the circuit is arranged to be formed incessantly by internally switching the power supply signal by means of the fundamental clock signal. Due to such an arrangement, there is generated in general a high frequency electromagnetic wave with energy that is proportional to the strength of the fundamental clock signal. The electromagnetic wave thus generated tends to affect adversely the operation of other external circuits, especially of high frequency circuits electromagentic wave interference . In particular, in prior art IC devices, the power supply current loops are long due to the arrangement for the I O pins. Hence, the radiated energy of the high frequency electromagnetic wave is large, resulting in an electromagnetic wave interference which is large accordingly. In order to prevent the generation of such an electromagnetic wave interference, a countermeasure is ordinarily worked out such as to shield the integrated circuits that can potentially become the cause of the electromagnetic wave interference, along with the peripheral circuits. However, the shielding method is inconvenient in that it takes trouble for its implementation. Moreover, measures against a large electromagnetic wave interference such as the one mentioned in the above, necessarily involve factors that are largely technical skill in nature, so that there are cases in which the adaption of the shielding measure alone is often found to be insufficient. For this reason, appearance of other measures, in addition to the shielding measure, has been desired against the electromagnetic wave interference. In fact, urgently needed is the availability of an optimum measure which may be obtained, for example, by a combination of a plurality of measures depending upon the need. From JP A 59 222949 a superhigh integrated electronic circuit device is known which has a plurality of pads for external connection and reference potential and external connection and signal. The pads for external connection and reference potential are arranged to be mutually opposite to the pads for external connection and signal. The pads for external connection and reference are mutually coupled together by a wiring layer formed on the substrate of the superhigh integrated electronic circuit device. An object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement of I O pins for an IC device which is capable of contributing to the prevention of generation in other circuit of an adverse influence due to electro magnetic wave interference. Another object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement of I O pins for an IC device which is capable of suppressing the generation of a high frequency radiation from the power supply current loops. The above objects are solved in accordance with the invention by an integrated circuit device, comprising an integrated circuit package an integrated circuit chip 1 contained in said package, said integrated circuit chip including at least digital circuits which are to be operated by high frequency power signals a set of first I O pins which extend from said package and which are arranged to be connected, respectively, to first terminals of a plurality of power supplies required for providing said high frequency power signals at least one second I O pin which is to be connected to at least one second terminal of the plurality of power supplies, said at least one second terminal serving as a ground terminal and bypass capacitors connected, respectively, between each of said first terminals and ground said set of first I O pins and said at least one second I O pin being arranged adjacent to each other and at positions nearest to the digital circuits such that each first I O pin, said integrated circuit chip, said at least one second I O pin and a respective one of said bypass capacitors forms a current loop of minimized length. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown an IC device of DIP type package embodying the present invention. As shown in the figure, the IC device comprises an IC chip 1, which is mounted on a pin 22 and is molded by a package 7 made of synthetic resins, and I O pins 8 through 21. And, two kinds of power supply 3 and 5 heareafter 3 and 5 will be referred to as V In other words, in an IC device that has the arrangement for terminals as described above, there are formed paths V Now, a general prior art IC device, as shown by Fig. 1, having arrangement of I O pins with a large quantity of radiated energy of high frequency electromagnetic wave will be compared with the above embodiment of the present invention. In the IC device of Fig. 1, having the I O pins 29 through 42, the pin 30 is used as the ground terminal. It has an arrangement of I O pins in which the pin 31 that is situated adjacent to the ground terminal 30 is the V In the IC device as shown in Fig. 1, a path V In the two paths, the former path is formed between the ground terminal 30 and the adjacently arranged V Therefore, by devising a countermeasure against the electromagnetic wave interference, such as reduction in the lengths of the power supply current loops in the IC device itself, it may become possible at times to do without the shielding measure. Also, by employing the above method along with the shielding measure, it may be expected to become possible to prevent more positively the generation of an adverse influence due to electromagnetic wave interference. It should be mentioned that although the description of the present embodiment given in the foregoing is made in conjunction with a DIP type package, it will also be applicable naturally to other devices such as flat package, chip carrier type package, and pin grid array type package. In addition, the construction described in the above is such that the V Moreover, the foregoing description of the embodiment was made for the case when there is just one ground for two power supplies 3 and 5. However, when there exist separate grounds for each of the two power supplies, similar effect can be expected by arranging the pins for each pair of power supply and ground to be adjacent to each other, and then by arranging the two sets of the power supply and ground pair adjacent to each other. Furthermore, when one ground is shared by more than three power supplies, it becomes necessary to arrange the first and second I O pins in such a way as to place each power supply terminal at a position which is adjacent to the ground terminal, in order to minimize the lengths of the power supply current loops. In particular, such consideration needs for applying the present concept to an IC device of the so called pin grid array PGA type, rather than to a DIP type IC device as was employed in connection with the description of the present embodiment. In summary, according to the present invention, the I O pins on the IC package are arranged such that the first I O pins connected to the power supplies are positioned adjacent to the second I O pins connected to the ground that correspond to respective power supplies. By so arranging, generation of a high frequency radiation from the power supply current loops can be suppressed by the reduction in the lengths of the power supply current loops. Therefore, such an arrangement can qualify as one sure and appropriate measure for preventing the generation of the electromagnetic wave interference.
