# Selective hydrogenation of benzene di and tri methanol compounds.

## Abstract
Benzene di and tri methanol compounds are selectively halogenated by reaction in aqueous solution at 70 to below 100 C with HCl or HBr in the presence of a water immiscible solvent eg. toluene. The process is particularly suitable for the preparation of 4 bromo and 4 chloromethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene methanols which are believed to be novel compounds and useful in the synthesis of pesticidal compounds.
