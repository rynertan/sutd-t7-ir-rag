# Method and apparatus for forming nitric oxide from ammonia.

## Abstract
Nitric oxide is formed by the oxidation of ammonia. An ammonia containing gas is contacted with an oxidation catalyst deposited on a surface of a solid electrolyte while an oxygen containing gas is contacted with a second cata lyst capable of dissociating oxygen gas to oxygen ion de posited upon a second surface of the solid electrolyte. Oxygen ion is transported through the solid electrolyte to react with ammonia to form nitric oxide under simulta neous production of electric energy.
