# Process for purifying urea containing waste water and process for preparing melamine.

## Abstract
An improved process for the removal of urea from urea containing waste water by hydrolysis and desorption of the ammonia and carbon dioxide thus formed. Urea containing waste water is treated in a process for the separation of ammonia and carbon dioxide from mixtures thereof, which process has a an ammonia separation zone 3 wherefrom ammonia, substantially free of carbon dioxide and water, is obtained, b a carbon dioxide separation zone 18 wherefrom carbon dioxide, substantially free of ammonia and water is obtained, and c a desorption zone 10 wherefrom water, substantially free of carbon dioxide and ammonia is obtained. The urea is substantially completely hydrolyzed and the ammonia and carbon dioxide produced thereby can be recovered.
