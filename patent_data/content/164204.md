## Description
NOVEL PHARMACEUTICALLY USEFUL PYRIMIDINES This invention relates to new compounds, methods for their preparation and compositions containing them. According to the invention we provide the use as a pharmaceutical of a compound of formula I,EMI1.1 in which one of the groups R and R3 has no significance and the other is hydrogen, phenyl or alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by phenyl, and when R3 has no significance R can additionally represent alkanoyl C1 to 6, one of the bonds is a double bond and the other is a single bond, R1, and at least one of R2, R4 and R5, may be the same or different and are selected from a pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, thiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, imidazolyl and phenyl ring,which rings may optionally be substituted by one or more of the groups halogen, COOR5, COR5, CN, CONH2, SO2NR5R6, NR NR5 6, OR5 or alkyl C1 to 6 which latter is optionally substituted by fluorine, R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, each represent hydrogen or alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by mono or di alkyl C1 to 6 amino, and the remainder of R2, R4 and R5 are selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl C1 to 6 and alkoxy C1 to 6 in addition to the significances given above, or R1, and one of R4 and R5 have the significances given above and an adjacent pair of R2,R4 and R5 together form a CH CH CH CH chain, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. According to the invention we also provide as new compounds those compounds of formula I in which R2 andR4 do not together form a chain CH CH CH CH , and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. According to the invention we also provide a process for the production of a new compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises a reaction of a compound of formula II,EMI2.1 in which R2, R4 ant are as defined above, andZ is a good leaving group, with a compound of formula III, R1 NRC NR3 NH2 III or a salt thereof, in which R, R1 and R3 are as defined above, b production of a compound of formula I in which R is alkanoyl C1 to 6 by alkanoylation of a corresponding compound of formula I in which one of R and R3 is hydrogen, c production of a compound of formula I in which one ofR and R3 is alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by phenyl, by alkylation or phenylalkylation of a corresponding compound of formula I in which one of R andR3 is hydrogen, d production of a compound of formula I carrying a COOH substituent by hydrolysis of a corresponding compound of formula I carrying a COOalkyl or CONH2 substituent, e production of a compound of formula I carrying an OH substituent by removal of an alkyl group from a corresponding compound of formula I carrying an alkoxy substituent, or f production of a compound of formula I in which at least one of R2, R4 and R5 is alkoxy optionally substituted by mono or di alkylamino, by reaction of a corresponding compound of formula I in which at least one of R2, R4 and R5 is hydroxy, with an optionally mono or di alkylamino substituted alkylating agent, and if desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I to pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or vice versa. Process a may be carried out in a solvent which is also a base, e.g. pyridine, and may be carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 to the reflux temperature of the reaction medium, e.g. at about 1150. The good leaving group Z may be, for example, a dialkylamino, hydroxy or alkoxy, e.g ethoxy, group. When R4 in the compound of formula II is alkoxy the group R4 in the product compound is OH. The alkanoylation of process b may be carried out using a suitable alkanoylating agent, e.g. an appropriate anhydride such as acetic anhydride, in pyridine. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about o to 500C. Process c may be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. diethyl ether, acetone or acetonitrile. The alkylating agent may be, for example, an alkyl halide, e.g. methyl iodide, or a phenylalkyl halide, e.gJ benzyl bromide. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base, eg sodium hydride when substitution in position R is required. The hydrolysis of process d may be carried out using a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, in a water miscible solvent, e.g. ethanol or glyme. Process e may be carried out using conventional ether cleavage techniques, eg a mixture of acetic acid and hydrobromic acid or sodium sulphide in a suitable solvent, eg N methylpyrrolidone. The reaction is preferably carried out at an elevated temperature, eg of from about 800 to lOO0C. The alkylation of process f may be carried out using conventional alkylation conditions, e.g. where R4 in the product compound is to be methoxy using diazomethane in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g.N,N dimethylformamide. Alternatively the compound of formula I in which one of R2, R4 and R5 is hydroxy may be reacted with an optionally substituted alkyl halide, e.g. in the presence of a strong base. The compounds of formula I may be recovered from their reaction mixture using conventional techniques which are known per se. The starting materials for the above processes are either known or they may be made from known compounds using conventional techniques known per se. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include acid addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic anions, e.g. the chloride, sulphate, maleate or tartrate anions. The compounds of formula I, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals in particular they are useful because they possess immunoregulant activity, e.g. in the test set out in Example A. Thus the new compounds are indicated for use in the elevation of depressed immune responses associated with therapy, e.g. with cytotoxic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs or by radiotherapy or surgery. The compounds thus render the patient less susceptible to immunosuppressive side effects such as secondary infectious episodes or bone marrow depression. The compounds may be applied as an adjunct to existing therapy. The compounds are also indicated for elevation of depressed immune responses associated with secondary immunodeficiency disease AIDS, neoplastic disease and in infectious diseases mediated by viral, bacterial, fungal or metazoan parasitic agents. Thus the compounds may be applied alone or with an anti infective agent. The compounds are further indicated for use in thermal injuries, surgery post operative stress , wound healing and immunodeficiencies associated with ageing. The compounds are also indicated to modulate aberrant immunoregulatory pathways as seen in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis. For the above mentioned uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired e.g. topical, parenteral or oral and the disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered at a dosage of from 0.1 to 200mg per kg of animal body weight in the test set out inExample A. For man the indicated total daily dosage is in the range of from lmg to 1000mg and preferably from l0mg to 500mg, which may be administered, for example twice weekly, or in divided doses from 1 to 6 times a day or in sustained release form.Thus unit dosage forms suitable for administration, e.g. oesophageally, comprise from 2mg to 500mg, and preferably lmg to 500mg of the compound preferably admixed with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or adjuvant. We prefer R1 and those of R2, R4 and R5 which represent rings to be different. We also prefer at least one of R1 and R2 to be a substituted ring. Thus whenR2, R4 or R5 is a benzene ring we prefer the ring to carry a substituent in a position para to the pyrimidine group. When R1 is a benzene ring we prefer the ring to be unsubstituted or to carry a substituent para to the group NR . Specific substituents on the benzene or other rings are halogen, e.g. chlorine hydroxy alkoxy C1 to 6, e.g. OCH3 CN COOH COOCH3 COCH3 SO2N CH3 2 N CH3 2 CH3 or OCH2CH2N C2H5 2. We prefer R3 to have no significance. Specific values for R are H, CH31 C2H5, CH2CH2CH3, CH CH3 2, acetyl, 2 methylpropanoyl, phenyl or benzyl. We prefer R4 to be hydrogen. We particularly prefer R2 to be a para substituted, e.g. a para alkoxy methoxy substituted, benzene ring,R4 and R5 to be hydrogen, R3 to have no significance, R to be alkyl C1 to 4, e.g. methyl, or alkanoyl C2 to 4, e.g. acetyl, and for R1 to be phenyl and preferably unsubstituted phenyl. According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising . preferably less than 80 , and more preferably less than 50 by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets, capsules and dragees microcyrstalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, diatomaceous earth, a sugar such as lactose, dextrose or mannitol, talc, stearic acid, starch, sodium bicarbonate and or gelatin for suppositories, natural or hardened oils or waxes and for inhalation compositions, coarse lactose. The compound of formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably is in a form having a mass median diameter of from 0.01 to 10 microns.The compositions may also contain suitable preserving, stabilising and wetting agents, solubilisers, sweetening and colouring agents and flavourings. The compositions may, if desired, be formulated in sustained release form. We prefer compositions which are designed to be taken oesophageally and to release their contents in the gastrointestinal tract. Compounds of formula I in which R2, R4 or R5 is hydroxy can also exist in tautomeric keto forms which are also encompassed within the present invention.

Example AAugmentation of depressed immune responses Tumour bearing animals are often found to have significantly depressed immune responses. This depression is currently thought to be a result of the tumour releasing immunosuppressive factors. In man, this immunosuppression is further exacerbated by the treatment of the tumour, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, all of which are known to cause immunosuppression. The compounds of the invention augment immune responses in normal animals. To ascertain if augmentation can be achieved in tumour bearing animals or drug treated animals the following Experiments are performed. a C57 B1 mice receive subcutaneous implantations of small pieces of Lewis lung sarcoma just above their hind legs. The compound is dosed orally at 50mg kg daily for the next four days. One week after implantation the mice are sensitised with 5 oxazolone on their shaved abdomen and further dosed with test compound as above for the next two days. 14 days after implantation the mice are challenged on their left ears with 1 oxazolone and ear thickness increases a measure of a delayed contact cell mediated immune response are read 24 hours later. The delayed contact response in control mice with tumour implants alone is significantly inhibited. b The immune response to oxazolone in C57B1 mice is inhibited by the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide, given two days after sensitisation with oxazolone, at a dose of 200mg kg by the intraperitoneal route. A 64 inhibition of the contact response was observed. In mice dosed with the compounds of the invention at 20mg kg by the subcutaneous route, the day before, on, and the day after sensitisation, the inhibition was decreased thus showing a significant rescue from the inhibitory effect of cyclophosphamide.
