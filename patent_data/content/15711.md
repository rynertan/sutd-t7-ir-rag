# Colour image sensing.

## Abstract
A colour image sensing array 100 includes an array of semiconductor image sensing cells, each cell having super posed upper 106 and lower 108 light responsive channels for producing first and second photosignals, the intrinsic spec tral responses of the channels being different but overlapping due to the differential absorption of light by the semiconductor material, and respective colour filter elements 118 disposed over the image sensing cells, the array of filter elements having elements of a first relative transmittance 120 matching the spectral response of one of the channels an image sensing cell and elements of a second relative transmittance 122 match ing the spectral response of the other channel of the image sensing cells. Known matrixing procedures are employed to separate a relatively high resolution first signal and relatively lower resolu tion second and third signals from the photosignals produced by the colour image sensing member of an array.
