# Thermosensitive recording material.

## Abstract
A thermosensitive recording material comprising a support bearing a thermosensitive layer comprising a chro mogenic material, a developer capable of developing a co our with the chromogenic material on heating suitably present in a weight ratio of developer to chromogenic ma terial of from 1 1 to 5 1 , a binder suitably present in an amount of from 10 to 50 by weight of the thermosen sitive layer , and an inorganic filler suitably present in a weight ratio of filler to chromogenic material of from 1 1 to 10 1 which inorganic filler comprises hexagonal sy stem thin plate kaolin to reduce abrasion and sticking to the thermal head of residue. The inorganic filler may also comprise other inorganic fillers, especially precipitated cal cium carbonate, in which case the weight ratio of the kao lin to the other inorganic filler s is suitably from 1 0.3 to 1 1. The thermosensitive layer may also contain thermo sensitivity improving materials such as waxes, especially non petroleum waxes, which are suitably present in in a weight ratio of wax to chromogenic material of from 1 1 to 4 1.
