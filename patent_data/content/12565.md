## Description
This invention relates to an improvement over the swing seats described in the Complete Specification of our British Patent Application No. 9361 75 Serial No.1,535,728 and in the corresponding patents and applications in other countries. Traditionally, swing seats were made of wood but it has been recognised for many years that wooden seats can inflict severe injury and a number of alternative constructions have been proposed. One alternative form of construction is to make the swing seat of rubber with a metal core and seats of this kind were proposed some thirty to forty years ago. The swing seats described in our earlier application are of this general type but the rubber at the periphery of the seat is moulded into a particular configuration to give enhanced safety by virtue of the impact force deflection energy absorption characteristic provided by the particular configuration. Swings seats in accordance with the description given in our earlier application have proved very successful in safety tests but it would naturally be desirable to have an even safer swing seat if that were possible.On the other hand, safety is not the only consideration as one must also take into account cost of manufacture, strength, durability and resistance to vandalism. The problem therefore exists to improve upon the safety of our earlier swing seats whilst retaining their strength, durability and resistance to vandalism and at the same time keeping down manufacturing costs. The present invention provides a seat for a swing, the seat being of composite structure comprising a first member, which is sufficiently rigid to bear the weight of a user, and a second member of a compressible polymeric material, the first member being of substantially laminar form and the second member covering at least part of the peripheral edge of the first member, characterised in that the first member is made of a lightweight metal alloy and has a number of integrally formed ribs depending from its underside. The first member can be oblong with the ribs running parallel to the longitudinal axis of the oblong. There can be five or more, preferably, seven ribs provided. The first member can be provided with a peripheral flange. The first member can be rectangular and a respective rib can define the flange on each long side of the rectangle. A respective angle member can be provided at each short side of the rectangle to define the flange on each short side. The angle members can be riveted to the remainder of the first member. The substantially laminar part and integrally formed ribs can comprise an extrusion of aluminium alloy. Each rib can be tapered and be thinnest at its distal part. The second member can be as described or claimed in our earlier application. By way of example only, an illustrative embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a section through an aluminium alloy extrusion. Figure 2 shows an underneath scrap viewoof the extrusion, Figures 3 and 4 show elevation and plan views of an angle member, Figure 5 is a cut away perspective view of the extrusion and angle member assembled into a core member, Figure 6 is a section through a swing seat including the core member1 and Figure 7 is an underneath view of the swing seat. United States Patent Specification 4,066,258 issued 3rd January 1978 corresponds to our British PatentApplication No. 9361 75 Serial No. 1,535,728 and provides a published description of the swing seats on which the present embodiment is based. The description contained in United States Patent 4,066,258 or any other published equivalent to 9361 75 will therefore be taken as the starting point for the present description.The reader is assumed to have available a copy of UnitedStates Patent 4,066,258 or its equivalent and the disclosure thereof is incorporated herein by reference. The present embodiment consists of a swing seat as described with reference to Figures 1 to 3 of UnitedStates Patent 4,066,258 with the exception that instead of the core member reference 1 of the earlier specification a different form of core member is used, The core member 1 of the earlier specification is here replaced by a core member 1 shown in the accompanying drawings. Parts which differ from our earlier swing seat are given primed reference numerals, parts which correspond are given unprimed numerals. Parts with unprimed reference numerals will not necessarily be described again here. The core member 1 consists of an extruded section 100 of aluminium alloy and two aluminium alloy angle members 102 riveted thereto. A preferred alloy is one in accordance with British Standard BS1474 Grade HE30 TF to provide lightness, strength and corrosion resistance. Figure 1 shows a cross section through the part 100 .The extruded section defines a laminar body portion 104 with seven ribs 106 depending therefrom. The outermost of the ribs define peripheral flanges 108 , 109 and each rib is tapered being thinnest at its distal end. The following are suitable dimensions for the section 100 , the reference letters being marked in Figure 1.A 6.9 inches, B 0.75 inches, C 1.65 inches, D 0.9 inches1E 0.1 inches E being the thickness at the top of each of the five central ribs , F 0.075 inches F being the thickness at the distal end of each of the five central ribs , G 0.125 inches, and H 0.1 inches. Four holes 3 of 716 inches diameter are formed in the section 100 and the dimensions I and J relating thereto are respectively 0.825 inches and 5.25 inches.Although the dimension I, for example, is given to three decimal places it is not intended to imply that great precision in construction is essential. Figure 2 is a scrap view of the underneath of the section 100 and introduces three further dimensionsK, L and M equal, respectively, to 15.16, 14 and 0.58 inches. Figures 3 and 4 show elevation and plan views of one of the angle members 102 . Each angle member 102 is an extruded right angle section of aluminium alloy and has two 7 16 inch diameter holes 110 formed therein to correspond to the holes 3. The following dimensions are suitable N 6.7 inches, 0 0.85 inches, P 1.2 inches, Q 0.585 inches, R 0.1 inches, S 0.725 inches,T 5.25 inches. The core member 1 is assembled by riveting a respective one of the angle members 102 to each end of the section 100 with the holes 110 and 3 aligned as indicated in the perspective sketch Figure 5. Aluminium rivets not shown , two per angle member, are used and located for example, between the second and third and the fifth and sixth ribs. The angle members together with the first and seventh ribs define a peripheral flange about the core member. The assembled core member 1 has the cushioning member 2 described in United States Patent 4,066,258 bonded to it, Figure 6 showing a section through the bonded structure corresponding to Figure 2 of our prior specification.The peripheral flange of the core member 1 is completely embedded in the cushioning member 2 but the central part 112 of the underside of the core member is left exposed as shown in the underneath view Figure 7. The swing seat with the core member 1 is even safer than our earlier swing seat because the present core member has a substantially smaller mass than the steel core member of our earlier seat so reducing force applied in impact. Moreover, the present configuration achieves this reduced mass whilst enhancing the strength and durability, retaining the resistance to vandalism of our earlier seat and keeping manufacturing costs down. The present core member can be used with other cushioning members besides that described, for example, with the cushioning member described with reference toFigures 4 to 6 of United States Patent 4,066,258, the given dimensions being modified as necessary.
