## Description
The present invention relates to a unique and novel improved process for the manufacture of a gel free neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer having both improved physical and rheological properties, by sulfonation of an unsaturated elastomer in a solution of a non reactive solvent, inactivation of the sulfonation cement with isopropanol, the optional introduction of an ionic group plasticizer, and neutralization with a solution of a neutralizing agent dissolved in water to produce neutralized sulfonated cements with viscosities sufficiently low to be handled in manufacturing processes, wherein the concentration level of water is less than 2.5 volume percent based on a volume of the non reactive solvent. The elastomeric polymers of the present invention are derived from elastomers having olefinic unsaturation sites wherein the polymer has from 0.1 to 10.0 mole percent olefinic unsaturation. The unsaturation sites can be in the polymer backbone, pendant therefrom or cyclic except that aromatic polymers are excluded from this description. In particular, the unsaturated polymers of this present invention include low unsaturated polymers such as Butyl rubber or EPDM polymers. Additionally, other unsaturated polymers contemplated are partially hydrogenated polyisoprenes, partially hydrogenated polybutadienes, isoprenestyrene copolymers, butadiene styrene copolymers, or Neoprene. Righly unsaturated elastomers other than Neoprene would be contemplated in this invention however, high unsaturation hydrocarbon polymers, such as polybutadiene, gel with the reagents of this invention during sulfonation and useful products result. Gel free means that the sulfonated polymer contains less than 5 wt. Z gel, more preferably less than 3, and most preferably less than about 1 as measured by stirring a given weight of polymer in a solvent comprised of 95 toluene 5 methanol at a concentration of 50 g liter for 24 hours, allowing the mixture to settle, withdrawing a weighed sample of the supernatant solution and evaporating to dryness. In the practice of this invention, the molecular weight of the elastomeric polymer and the concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the nonreactive sulfonation are very important. In order to have a viable process, the neutralized sulfonated cement at the end of the process must have sufficiently low viscosities so that the cement may be properly handled with pumping operations, cleaning operations, and the like.The major factors which contribute to the viscosity of the final neutralized sulfonated cement are molecular weight of the base elastomeric polymer, the concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the non reactive sulfonation cement, the relative amount of S03E groups incorporated into the elastomeric polymer, the polar solvent used in reducing ionic associations thereby reducing the viscosity of the neutralized cement, and the amount of water in the cement. In order to have an economical process, it is necessary to sulfonate elastomeric polymer cements containing at least 50 g. elastomeric polymer per liter of nonreactive solvent. This situation obtains because in a commercial manufacturing process, solvents must be recovered and recycled. The more solvent recycled per unit elastomeric polymer product, the more expensive the product. In the present invention, the preferred elastomeric polymer concentration in non reactive solvent is at least about 50 g. liter. In addition, it is necessary that the elastomeric polymer cements be low in viscosity. Sulfonation of the polymer cement does not result in substantial viscosity increases however, neutralization results in very large solution viscosity increases, or in the extreme gel, due to the ionic associations. Therefore, it is important to keep the starting cement viscosities low by using polymer concentrations as low as economically feasible. However, high polymer concentrations are still possible if the molecular weight or Mooney viscosities are low. It is important wherefore in the practice of this invention to use elastomeric polymers with as low Mooney viscosities as possible. It has been found that neutralized sulfonated polymers possess good physical properties even if the Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F of the starting polymer is 5.On the other hand, at the high Mooney viscosities when cements containing 50 g. polymer liter solvent are sulfonated and neutralized extremely high final cement viscosities are obtained. The process of this invention can be practiced when the elastomeric polymer cement at a concentration of 50 g. polymer liter of non reactive solvent possesses at 25eC. a Brookfield viscosity of 2500 centipoise cps or less.The Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of the elastomeric polymer is preferably 5 to 60, more preferably 10 to 50, and most preferably 15 to 25. The expression Butyl rubber as employed in the specification and claims is intended to include copolymers made from a polymerization reaction mixture having therein from 70 to 99.5 by weight of an isoolefin which has 4 to 7 carbon atoms, e.g., isobutylene,and 0.5 to 30Z by weight of a conjugated multiolefin having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g., isoprene. The resulting copolymer contains 85 to 99.8 by weight of combined isoolefin and 0.2 to 15Z of combined multiolefin. The preparation of Butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent 2,356,128. For the purposes of this invention, the Butyl rubber may have incorporated therein from 0.2 to 10 of combined multiolefin preferably 0.5 to 62 more preferably 1 to 4 , e.g., 2 . Illustrative of such a Butyl rubber is Exxon Butyl 365 Exxon Chemical Co. , having a mole percent unsaturation of 2.0 and a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 45. Very low molecular weight Butyl rubbers, i.e.,Butyl rubbers having a viscosity average molecular weight of 5,000 to 85,000 and a mole percent unsaturation of 3 to 4 may be sulfonated by the process of this invention. Preferably, these polymers have a viscosity average molecular weight of 25,000 to 60,000. The term EPDM is used in the sense of its definition as found in ASTM D 1418 64 and is intended to mean a terpolymer containing ethylene and propylene in the backbone and a diene in the side chain. Illustrative methods for producing these terpolymers are found in U.S. Patent 3,280,082, British Patent 1,030,289 and French Patent 1,386,600. The preferred terpolymers contain 45 to 75 wt.X ethylene and 1 to 10 wt. of a diene monomer, the balance of the polymer being propylene. Preferably, the polymer contains 45 to 70 wt. X ethylene, e.g., 50 wt. , and 2.6 to 8.0 wt. Z diene monomer, e.g., 5.0 wt. . The diene monomer is preferably a nonconjugated diene. Illustrative of these nonconjugated diene monomers which may be used in the EPM terpolymer EPDM are 1,4hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, 5 propenyl 2 norbornene and methyl tetrahydroindene. A typical SEPUM is Vistalon 2504 ExxonChemical Co. ,a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F. of 40 and having 50 wt. Z of ethylene, 45 wt. of propylene, and 5.0 wt. of 5 ethylidene 2 norbor nene with an Mn of 47,000, an Mv of 145,000 and an My of 174,000. Another EPDM terpolyrner, Vistalon 2504 20 is derived from Vistalon 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. by a controlled extrusion process, wherein the resultant Mooney viscosity at 212 F. is 20. The Mn of Vistalon 504 20 is 26,000, the Mv is 90,000 and the Mw is 125,000. Nordel 1320 duPont is another EPDM terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity at 212 F. of 25 and having 53 wt. of ethylene, 3.5 wt. 7. of 1,4 hexadiene, and 43.5 wt. of propylene. The olefinically unsaturated polymer is dissolved in a suitable non reactive solvent usually at a concentration level of 2 to 25 wt. a, more preferably at 5 to 20 and most preferably at 10 to lSwt. Suitable solvents for sulfonation are chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as 1,2 dichloroethane, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or aliphatic hydrocarbons having 4 to 7 carbon atoms per molecule, more preferably 5 to 6 carbon atoms per molecul such as isomeric pentanes and hexancs and mixtures thereof. In terms of a economical process halogenated solvents are less preferred as well as solvents boiling above 800 C. Preferred solvents are hydrocarbons boiling at about or below 800 C. such as hexane and cyclohexane. The most preferred solvents are the saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons containing from 4 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule and mixtures thereof. The olefinically unsaturated polymer dissolved in the solvent is sulfonated with a sulfonating agent selected from an acyl sulfate, or a sulfur trioxide donor complexed with a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus. The term sulfur trioxide donor as used in the specification means a compound containing available sulfur trioxide. Illustrative of such sulfur trioxide donors are so3, chlorosulfonic acid and fluorosulfonic acid. The term complexing agent11 as used in the specification means a Lewis base suitable for use in the practice of this invention, wherein Lewis base is an electron pair donor. Illustrative of Lewis bases suitable for use as complexing agents are certain phosphorus compounds. While the phosphorus compound may be either inorganic or organic, it is preferred that the phosphorus compound be an organic compound. Various organic phosphites, phosphinites, phosphinates, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphonites and phosphines may be used as the complexing agent. The organic substituents consist of C1 to C10 alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl groups. The nitrogen containing Lewis bases form highly stable complexes with sulfur trioxide donors and are not considered suitable for sulfonation of the unsaturated polymers of this invention. Other Lewis bases suitable as complexing agents are those Lewis bases which contain oxygen or sulfur. Ethers and thioethers have been found useful for complexing sulfur trioxide donor to moderate reaction with the unsaturation of polymer molecules. The ethers and thioethers may contain one, two or more ether oxygens or sulfurs and may be linear or cyclic. Illustrative of the ether Lewis bases suitable for use are tetrahydrofuran, paradioxane, 2, 3 dichloro l, 4 dioxane, metadioxane 2,4 dimethyl 1,3 diox2ne, 2 phenyl L,3 dioxane diethyl ether trioxane and bis 2 chloroethyl ether, The preferred oxygen containing bases are p dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and bis 2.chloroethyl ether. Illustrative of the thioethers are diethyl sulfide and tetrahydrothiophene. Other oxygen containing Lewis bases suitable as complexing agents are carboxylic acid esters wherein the carboxylic acid is a C1 to C10 aliphatic acid, benzoic acid, or phenylacetic acid. Illustrative of such esters are benzyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, methyl benzoate, p nitrophecyl acetate, ethyl n butyrate, ethyl stearate, and ethyl phenyl acetate. The molar ratio of SO3 donor to complexing agent may be as high as 15 to 1 preferably less than 9 1 more preferably about 4 1 to about 1 1 e.g. 2 1. The preferred solvents for preparation of the com plexes of sulfur trioxide donor with complexing agents containing oxygen or sulfur are chlorinated hydrocarbons.Illustrative of such chlorinated solvents are carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chloroform, and methylene chloride.The complexes may also be prepared by direct addition of reagents, if precautions are taken to dissipate evolved heat. The reactions of ethereal complexes of S03 with the unsaturation of polymer chains has been found to be nonquantitative. Therefore, the use of excess complex is required to give the desired level of sulfonation. The preferred sulfonating agents are the acyl sulfates, in particular acetyl sulfate. Suitable acyl sulfates are acetyl, propionyl,butyryl, or benzoyl sulfate, in particular acetyl sulfate. The acyl sulfate may be produced by reacting concentrated sulfuric acid with an acid anhydride. For example, acetic anhydride may be reacted with sulfuric acid to form acetyl sulfate which may be used to sulfonate the polymets . If desired, acetic anhydride may be added to a solution of the polymer in a suitable solvent and sulfuric acid subsequently added to form acetyl sulfate in situ. Alternatively, sulfur trioxide may be reacted with acetic acid to form the acetyl sulfate. The preferred sulfonated agent is acetyl sulfate which can be prepared according to the following equations EMI9.1 Sulfonation of the polymer is conducted at a temperature between 40 C. and 1000C., wherein the reaction time is 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably 5 to 45 minutes and most preferably 15 to 30 minutes. The sulfonation of less substituted olefinic structures, such as derived from 1,4 hexadiene terpolymers requires somewhat higher temperatures, e.g., 500C., when unsaturation levels are low, e.g., less than 2 mole . More highly substituted olefinic structures, such as that derived from 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, are rapidly sulfonated at room temperature and below even at low levels of unsaturation.The product remtins soluble throughout the reaction. It should be pointed out that neither the sulfonating agent nor the manner of sulfonation is critical, provided that the sulfonating method does not degrade or cross link the polymer backbone. The amount of desirable sulfonation depends on the particular application. the elastomeric polymer is sulfonated at 10 to So meq. sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer, preferably at 15 to 50 meq. sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer, and more preferably at 20 to 40 meq. sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer. The meq. of sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer is determined by dissolving the sulfonated polymer in a mixed solvent of 95 parts of toluene and 5 parts of methanol at a concentration level of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The sulfonated polymer is titrated with sodium ethoxide to an Alizarin Thymolphthalein ed point. Sulfonate level can also be determined from sulfur content which is obtained by Dietert Analysis. Polymers containing unsaturation and sulfonate groups have been found to be somewhat deficient in thermostability. Therefore, it is desirable to neutralize a substantial portion of the sulfonate as part of the manufacturing of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer. Neutralization further improves the physical properties of the sulfonated polymer. In preparing the ionomer it is desirable to neutralize essentially every sulfonate group. In the present invention, neutralizing agent is added in sufficient excess to ensure the neutralization of all sulfonate. When the molecular weight of the elastomeric polymer or the concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the non reactive solvent is too high or when the sulfonate content of the elastomeric polymer is high, gelation can occur due to the ionic interactions between the sulfonate groups during sulfonation or between the metal sulfonate groups after neutralization. The ionic associations of the sulfonate groups are dissipated by ionic group plasticizers such as polar hydrocarbons. Neutralization of the sulfonate groups can be effected by the use of metallic salts of carboxylic acids, metallic carbonates or bicarbonates, or metallic hydroxides dissolved in water. However, extremely high cement viscosities or gels can develop due to the effects of the water added during neutralization thereby producing neutralized sulfonated elastomeric cements which cannot be stirred, pumped, poured cr otherwise easily handled. Since it is necessary to convert the unneutralized sulfonate groups to the metal sulfonate, it is necessary to use metal containing neutrali ing agents. It is further necessary that these neu tralizin agents be soluble in a solvent, even if that solvent is not miscible with the sulfonation cement.Most of the metal neutralizing agents which might be suitable for this invention are not sufficiently soluble in any organic type solvent. The only effective, available, inexpensive and easy to handle solvent is water. As a consequence, the problem of high viscosity or gelation during the neutralization of sulfonation cements can only be overcome by lowering the amount of water present in the neutralization system. The only effective manner in which this can be done is to choose only those neutralization agents which have a sufficiently high degree of solubility in water. Those neutralizing agents which are effective in neutralizing the polymer and in producing neutralized cements which can be processed are defined as those which possess solubilities such that thP sveignt of metal neutralizing agent which is equivalent to 200 milliequivalents of metal is soluble in 100 ml. of water or less at a temperature of from 0 C. to 1000C. There are four general classes of metal containing neutralizing agents which possess these solubility characteristics hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and carboxylates.Some of these reagents are given in Table I.

For free hydroxides only, the alkali mat rox ides and barium hydroxide fit the solubility criteria. For reasons of water solubility, cost and the ability of the cation to develop physical properties, sodium, potassium and barium hydroxides are the preferred hydroxides. Similarly, only the alkali metal carbonates and bicarbonates fit the solubility criteria. For reasons of solubility, cost and the ability of the cation to develop physical properties, sodium and potassium carbonates are the preferred carbonates. With the exception of barium, it is not possible to practice this invention with polyvalent hydroxides or carbonates. Only the carboxylates are generally useful.The carboxylate ion of the metallic salt is derived from the lower molecular weight aliphatic carboxylic acids, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyr c acid, and from benzoic acid. Because of availability, good water solubility, low molecular weight, and ease of handling, the acetates are the preferred carboxylates. The metallic ion of the metallic salt of the carboxylic acid is selected from a non limiting group consisting of lithium sodium, potassium, cesium, barium, calcium, magnesium, zinc lead, iron 11 , copper II , mercury II and nickel II . The preferred cations are those derived from sodium, barium, sa nesium, zinc and lead. A number of carboxylates fit the solubility criteria however, these largely consist cf the triacetates of the rare earth metals such as cerium, praseo dymium, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium, and the lik. These are. less readily available and more expensive than the acetates of the metals listed above. If the sulfonation cement at the end of the sulfonation is neutralized with an aqueous solution of the metallic neutralizing agent in the absence of a polar solvent severe gelation occurs. This gelation is not due to covalent cross linking but due to the ionic associations between the metal sulfonated groups. This gelation is reversible through the addition of polar solvents which sal. vate the ionic groups and permit solubility. Eow ever, the ionic polymers of this invention contain only a relatively small amount of polar groups and are constituted mainly of hydrocarbon, i.e. the polymer chains themselves. Consequently, when polar solvents are added to the hydrocarbon cements of the sulfonated cements, precipitation of the polymer may occur if too such solvent is added or the solvent is highly polar or both. It is further desirable to use a polar solvent which possesses a high degree of solubility in both the non reactive sulfonation solvent and water. The ideal polar solvent for these purposes is isopropanol. The amount of isopropanol that can be used could vary from S to 30 volume percent based on the volume of the non reactive solvent, for example 5 to 15 volume percent. At the higher isopropanol concentrations, the neutralized cement viscosities are the lowest and the most desirable however, it is desirable to keep the isopropanol concentrations low in order to prevent polymer precipitation and to facilitate the separation of solvent from isopropanol after the solvent is evaporated from the polymer in the steam stripping operation. The amount of water is kept at a minimum and is generally dictated not only by the solubility of the neutralizing agent but also the concentration of the polymeric species, the concentration of the sulfonate groups and the desired ratio of metal ion to sulfonate groups in the neutralized cement. The ratio of meq. of metal ion to meq. of sulfonate groups can be maintained at between 1.5 and 4.0 for concentrations of sulfonic acid groups less than 50 meq.per 100 grams of polymer. Water concentration of 5 volume or less based on the volume of the non reactive solvent, for example less than 2.5 volume percent, is effective in preventing gelation and in producing cements with sufficiently low viscosities. The viscosities of the neutralized cements are considered processable, when the room temperatureBrookfield viscosities do not exceed 20,000 centipoises cps at 0.6 rpm, more preferably 1000 to 10,000 cps. The metal neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer prepared according to this present invention can be isolated as a crumb by steam stripping. No surface active agents are needed to prepare the easy handling crumb. The crumb that is obtained is easily washed to remove water soluble impurities such as acetic acid and isopropanol and is suitable to be fed into a dewatering extruder or to be dried in a fluid bed dryer. A preferential plasticizer can also be added to the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer in solution, wherein the plasticizer is a carboxylic acid, ester of carboxylic acid , phenol , phosphate, amine or amide or mixture thereof. The preferred plasticizer is a carboxylic acid.The carboxylic acid is a Cloto C30 aliphatic carboxylic acid, preferably C12 to Cl8, most preferably stearic acid. The preferential plasticizer is incorporated into the neutralized sulfonated polymer in an amount at least 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably at 5 to 25 and most preferably at 7 to 21. parts by weight per 100 parts by weight. The process of the present invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples and tables. EXAMPLE 1 I To a solution of 500 grams of Vistalon 2504 having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F. of 40 in 5 liters of n hexane and 28.7 ml. of acetic anhydride was added drop wise 10.52 ml. of concentrated H2S04. The resultant cement was stirred for thirty minutes at room temperature and the reaction was quenched with 200 ml. of isopropanol contain ing 2.5 grams of Antioxidant 2246 American Cyanacide The cement was steam stripped the polymer washed with water in a Waring blender and then the crumb was dewatered and banded on a rubber mill at 1100 F. The isolated acid form of the sulfonated EPDM terpolymer was placed in vacuum ovens at 80 C. and 100 C. Samples were taken after 24 and 72 hours with the following results At 80 C.Sulfur Content wt. 24 hours 1.00 72 hours 0.92 At 100 C. 24 hours 0.78 72 hours 0.64 This example shows a marked loss in sulfur content indicative of a substantial decomposition of the sulfonic acid groups within the polymer. The oss of sulfur is only a minimum indicator for polymer deterioration. Deterioration can also occur without substantial sulfur loss. This example shows that the acid form of the sulfonated EPDM ter polymer is thermally labile and that great care must be exercised in its handling. EXAMPLE 2 Neat acetyl sulfate was prepared by cooling to 300 C. 76.3 ml. 0.81 mole of acetic anhydride and then 28.0 ml. 0.5 mole of concentrated sulfuric acid was added dropwise. The solution was permitted to warm to about 10 C.The molarity of this acetyl sulfate was 4.84. Three solutions of Vistalon 2504 having a Mooney viscosity NL, 1 8, 212 F. of 40 in n heptane were prepared. Cement Concentration Polymer. grams Heptane, ml. wt. A 100 2000 6.8 B 100 1670 8.1 C 100 1430 9.3 To each cement A, B and C was added 10.4 ml. of the 4.84 molar acetyl sulfate 50 mmoles . Samples A and B sulfonated smoothly without the formation of gel. The suldonated cement of run C was vary thick after 30 minutes and turned into a tight gel on standing shortly thereafter.This gel could easily be broken through the addition of an isopropanol which demonstrates that the gel was formed through sulfonic acid group associations rather than through covalently bonded cross linked sites. The formation of a gel is directly dependent upon the concentration of theEPDM terpolymer in the non reactive solvent.EXAMPLE 3 Fifty grams of Vistalon 2504 having a Nooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 40 was dissolved in 1000 ml.Of n heptane. To the cement at room temperature was added 5.2 ml. of 4.84 molar neat acetyl sulfate 25 mmoles . After 60 minutes, the fluid sulfonated cement was added to 1200 ml. of water in a baffled flask with good agitation.A gel quickly formed thereby illustrating the adverse effect of water on the acid form of the sulfonated EPDff terpolymer.EXAMPLE 4 Two hundred grams of Vistalon 2504 having a Mooney viscosity CML, 1 8, 2120F. of 40 was dissolved in 4000 ml. of n heptane. The amount was sulfonated with 16.8 ml.of 4.34 molar neat acetyl sulfate 81 mmoles . After 60 minutes, 1109 grams of the sulfonated cement was added to 2300 mi. of water containing 9.6 grams of Mg OOCCH3 .4H20 90 meq. with good agitation in a baffled flask. A thick nonhomogeneous suspension of a gel in water resulted thereby showing that neutralization in the absence of a polar solvent with a neutralizing agent dissolved in water results in a gel.EXAMPLE 5 Four solutions of Vistalon 2504 having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 20 were dissolved in n heptane at various concentrations Cement concentration Polymer warns n heptane ml. wt. 7.

After 30 minutes, 500 ml. of isopropanol was added. No gel occurred and the isopropanol quenched cements were very fluid. This example clearly demonstrates that lower molecular weight EPDEI terpolymers can easily be sulfonated at cement concentrations of about 15 weight percent.EXAMPLE 6 Five hundred grams of Vistalon 2504 having aMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 40 was dissolved in 10 liters of heptane. The cement was sulfonated with 42.0 ml. of 4.84 molar neat acetyl sulfate 250 mmole at room temperature. After 30 minutes the reaction was quenched with 500 ml. of isopropanol which was 5 volume percent on heptane. To 1243 grams of the cement equivalent to 100 grams of starting polymer was added 40 ml. of 1 molar magnesium acetate in water 80 meq. magnesium in 31.4 ml. of water or 3.1 volume percent of heptane . The neutralized cement was thick but stirrable. The addition of 200 ml. 2 volume percent of isopropanol to the neutralized cement resulted in a marked reduction in viscosity. The addition of another 60 ml. 6 volume percent of isopropanol resulted in a very fluid system. As little as 5 volume percent of isopropanol produced a fluid system. A relatively substantial amount of water, certainly more than is required to dissolve the magnesium acetate, can be handled through the use of sufficient amounts of isopropanol.EXAMPLE 7 Run A Five hundred grams of Vistalon 2504 having aMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120 F. of 20 was dissolved in 5000 ml. of n heptane. The cement was sulfonated at room temperature by first adding 28.7 ml. 304 mmoles of acetic anhydride and then slowly adding 10.52 ml. 187.7 moles H2S04 of concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction was quenched after thirty minutes with 250 ml. of isopropanol.Then 128 grams 450 mmnles of stearic acid was added and stirring was continued. A solution of 49.4 grams 450 meq. of Zn OOCCH3 2 2H20 in 125 ml. of H20 was added to the cement. The cement became very thick and a gel formed.Then 250 ml. of isopropanol was added and the gel was broken. The addition of another 250 ml. of isopropanol Other reduced the viscosity. This run showed that with 2.5 volume percent of water onheptane that netralizsd ents can be handled through the use of about 10 volume percent cf isopropanol. Fluid cements are obtained at 15 volume percent of isopropanol. Run B Five hundred grams of Vistalon 2504 having aMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 20 was dissolved in 5000 ml. of n heptane. The cement was sulfonated at room temperature by first adding 28.7 ml. 304 mmoles of acetic anhydride and then slowly adding 10.52 ml. 187.7 mmoles of concentrated sulfuric acid. After stirring the cement for 30 minutes the reaction was quenched with 250 ml. of isopropanol. Then 128 grams 450 mmoles of stearic acid was added. A solution of 450 meq. of zinc acetate in 250 ml. of water 5.0 volume percent on n heptane was used to neutralize the acid form of the polymer which resulted in a very thick cement. The addition of 250 ml. of isopropanol still resulted in a very thick cement. The addition of another 500 ml. of isopropanol resulted in a cement that could be easily stirred and poured.This run shows that a mixed solvent system of 5 volume percent water and 20 volume percent isopropanol can be used. Run C Another run was made which was identical to the procedures of Runs A and B. The cement was neutralized with 450 moles of zinc acetate in 375 ml. of water 7.5 volume percent on n heptane followed quickly by 250 ml. isopropanol. A bad gel resulted. However, the addition of another 750 ml. of isopropanol broke up the gel and resulted in a cement which could be stirred and poured. This example shows that a mixed solvent system of 7.5 volume percent of water and 25 volume percent of isopropanol can be used.EXAMPLE 8 Five hundred grams of Vistalon 2504 having aMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F. of 20 was dissolved in 5000 ml. of n heptane. The Brookfield viscosity of a sample of this cement was measured. The cement was sulfonated by the addition of 28.7 ml. 304 mmoles of acetic anhydride followed by the slow addition of 10.52 ml. 187.5 xmrles of concentrated sulfuric acid. The cement was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, and the sulfonation was inactivated with the addition of 750 ml. of isopropanol. A sample of the inactivated cement was taken for Brookfield viscosity measurement. A solution of 49.6 g. 450 meq. of Zn OOCCH3 2 2H20 in 125 ml. of water was prepared and added to the cement. The cement thickened, but it could be stirred and handled easily. The Brookfield viscosities at 250 C. of the cements were as follows Brookfield Viscosity Cement cDs rpm Starting Vistalon Cement 520 30 Inactivated Sulfon ion Cement 390 30 Neutalized Carnet 4050 60 These viscosity data show that substantial viscosity increases are obtained in the neutralization of the sulfonic acid however, the viscosities are easily tolerated and are well within easy handling capabilities of pumps.EXAMPLE 9 One hundred grams of 20 Mooney ML, 1 8, 2120 F. Vistalon 2504 was dissolved in 1000 ml. Exxon hexane. To the solution was added at room temperature 5.74 ml. acetic anhydride 60.75 mmoles and 2.10 ml. 37.5 mmoles of H2S04 of concentrated sulfuric acid. The cement was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then the sulfonation reaction was terminated through the addition of isopropanol.A sample of acid cement was isolated for sulfur analysis.Then 90 moles of stearic acid was added, and stirring was continued until solution occurred. Aqueous solutions of Zn OOCCH3 2 2H20 were prepared 60 meq. of zinc in 17 ml.water and 90 meq. of zinc in 25 ml. water. The zinc acetate solutions were added9 and stirring was continued for 30 minutes. The Brookfield viscosities of the cements were measured. The zinc neutralized polymer was isolated through steam stripping. The Brookfield viscosities, sulfonate contents and zinc contents are given in Table 2. This example demonstrates the use of stearic acid plasticizer as well as a range of water, isopropanol and zinc acetate concentrations in producing easy to handle cements and neutralized and plasticized sulfonated EPZ, gums.

EXAMPLE 10 In a series of three runs 500 g of 20 Mooney YL 1 8, 212 F. Vistalon 2504 was dissolved in 5000 ml. Exxon hexane. To the solution was added at roam temperature 28.7 ml. 303.75 mmoles of acetic anhydride followed by 10.52 ml 187.5 mmoles H2S04 of concentrated sulfuric acid. The cement was stirred for 30 minutes, and the sulfonation was inactivated with 750 ml. isopropanol. Samples were taken for sulfur analysis. Aqueous solutions of Zn OOCCH3 2.2H20 Mg OOCCH3 2 4H2O and Ba OOCCH3 2 were prepared by dissolving 450 milliequivalents in 125 ml. of water.These aqueous solutions were added to the inactivated cements. Viscose ties increased in all cases, but the cements could be readily handled. Antioxidant 2246 2.5g was added to the cementThe cements were steam stripped, the isolated polymers washes with water in a Waring blender, and the wet polymer crumb dewatered and dried on a rubber mill.

This example andExamples 13 and 14 illustrate the preparation of stearic acid plasticized gums of the Zn, Mg and Ba salts of sulfonate levels of about 20, 30 and 40 meq. sulfonate lOOg polymer. EXAMPLE 16 A series of sulfonations and neutralizations was effected in this Example. The variables were I amount of isopropanol added to the cement, 2 the amount of water used to dissolve the metal acetate and then added to the cement, 3 metal cation i.e., zinc and magnesium, 4 type of carboxylic acid plasticizer if any added and 5 concentration of carboxylic acid added. The runs were made at the 200g or the 500g starting polymer level according to the following ratios lOOg of 20 Nooney bL, 1 8, 212 F. Vistalon 2504 was dissolved in 1000 mlExxon hexane. To the solution was added at room temperature 5.74 ml. acetic anhydride 60.75 mmoles and 2.10 ml. 37.5 mmoles H2S04 of concentrated sulfuric acid.The cement was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and the sulfonation was terminated through the addition of 7.5 or 15.0 volume percent isopropanol on hexane solvent . Small samples of cement were taken for sulfur analysis. In the instances where no ionic domain plasticizer was desired, the cement was neutralized as described below. Otherwise, plasticizer either lauric acid or stearic acid was added to the cement at levels of 60, 75 and 90 mmoles per lOOg of starting polymer. Stirring was continued until all of the carboxylic acid plasticizer had been dissolved. Aqueous solution of Zn8OOCCH3 2 2H2O and Mg 00CCH3 2.4H20 were dissolved in 1.65, 2.1 and 2.5 volume percent water Con hexane solvent . These solutions were added to the sulfon ated cements with good agitation..Viscosity increases were obtained in all cases. Samples of the resultant cements were taken, and Brookfield viscosities were determined over a range of shear rates at room temperature. The remaining cement was steam stripped, the resultant polymer washed and pulverized in a Waring blender, ar.d the resultant wet crump was dewatered and dried on a rubber mill.

Flow properties were measured with an InstromCapillary Rheometer at 2000C. The mechanical and rheolgich.property data are given in Table 6. The data in this example show that a wide variety of thermoelastic systems differing in mechanical properties and In flow properties can be prepared according to the process of this invention by changing the neutralizing agent and its concentration aa by changing the carboxylic acid plasticizer and its concentration. This example further demonstrates the effective use of 7.5 volume percent isopropanol as well as 15 volume percent isopropanol. Even at the low levels of water used in this example, it is apparent that an increase in water concentration increases the Brookfield viscosities of the cements.

Vistalon 2504. Aft solution had occurred, 19.18 kg. i7.76 pounds of acetic anhydride was charged in. Then with the temperature at about 23 24 C , 11.95 kg. 26.4 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid was added slowly. The cement was stirred fox 30 minutes, and then 80 pounds 122 gallons of isopropanol was added. Samples were isolated and worked up for sulfur analysis. Analysis showed the sulfonated polymer to contain 31.9 meq. of sulfonic acid per lOOg of polymer. Then 174.2 pounds of stearic acid was charged in, and the cemeng was stirred until the stearic acid was all dissolved.A solution 30.5 kg. 67.4 pounds of Zn OOCCH3 2.2H20 aJuS dissolved in 77.3 kg. 170.4 pounds of water in a 55 gallon stainless steel drum. The aqueous solution was added to the deactivated cement. The resultant neutralized cement stirred very readily under the conditions and produced a very homogeneous cement. Antioxidant 2246 3.4 pounds was stirred in. The cement was transferred to a 55 gallon stainless steel drum by gravity feed. The kettle emptied easily, and the draining from the walls was excellent. Rinsing the walls down with toluene methanol cleaning solutions produced a clean kettle. The drums were fitted with a Graco Monark 5 1 ratio pump Model 206 393 which possesses a maximum pump delivery with continuous duty of 2.5 gallons minute. The neutralized cement was stripped at the rate of 50 70 gallons hour by pumping the neutralized cement into a continuous steam stripper whose main drum was 200 gallons in size. By suitable adjustment of the feed rate, agitation, hold up time and hot water temperature about 850C. an easily handled, non sticking crumb could be collected. The wet crumb produced in the stripping operation contained about 60 weight percent water.The crumb was fed to a dewatering extruder with an AcrisonInc. Model 105 double augur screw feeder having a 2 cubic foot hopper. The dewatering extruder was a 1.5 inch WeldingEngineers dewatering extruder equipped with a single adjustable orifice die plate. It was steam heated at 100 psig 675 kPa of steam. The temperature of the steam was about 175 C. The die plate was electrically heated at 1570C. The material emerged as a blown strand containing about 1 weight percent moisture. The material prepared in this way could be very easily mixed with extender oils, mineral fillers, carbon blacks and crher additives on rubber mills, and large and small Banbury. The formulations could be injected molded and extruded into end products such as sneakers, garden hose, etc. The improved process, as embodied in the aforementioned examples, for the preparation of a neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer clearly defines a means for producing gel free cements having viscosities below 20,000 centipoises at 0.6 rpm at room temperature which are easily stirrable and pourable.
