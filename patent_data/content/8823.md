# Crosslinked copoly carbonate phosphonate compositions.

## Abstract
Copoly carbonate phosphonates are formed by reac tion of a dihydric phenol, a carbonate precursor, and an organophosphorus dihalide. The inherent viscosity and melt ing point of such polymers is increased by the presence of an effective amount of a chain branching agent, optionally in the additional presence of a chain terminating agent.
