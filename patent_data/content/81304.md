# Drop and insert multiplex digital communications system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for dropping and inserting digital data in a time division multiplexed, serial data stream. A communications link is divided into two spans with an electrical switch 36 connecting the two spans. Data is used to derive channel timing information defining the time divisions or strobes of each of the multiplexed channels. The strobes are used to toggle the switch 36 so that local transmit and receive channels may be inserted and dropped in accord with the channel strobes. The same channel strobes used for transmitting local data are used for receiving data from the multiplexed bit stream. In the absence of channel strobes, the switch 36 connects the two links.
