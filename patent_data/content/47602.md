# Drive system for glass furnace stirrers.

## Abstract
A continuous tank type glass melting furnace seen in plan view in Figure 1 includes a melting section 11 into which raw materials are charged and reduced to a molten state. The molt en glass then flows through a relatively narrow waist or condi tioning area 13 to refining and conditioning zones 12 , and is then withdrawn as a continuous ribbon of sheet. Within the waist area there is provided a plurality of stirrers 16 whose mixing and kneading action assist in homogenizing the glass as it flows through the restricted area. Each stirrer is connect ed to and driven by its own individual power unit so that the speed and direction of rotation of individual stirrers can be in dependently regulated and synchronised. Individual stirrers can also be removed and replaced with little or no interruption in operation of the remaining units.
