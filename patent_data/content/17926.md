## Description
Digital Electronic Balancing ApparatusAs is known, in two plane balancing of rotating bodies, it is necessary to make some provision for the elimination of cross effect and to provide a method for accurately calibrating the analyzing instrument. In this respect, it is necessary to make some provision for assuring that the unbalance in one correction plane does not enter into the unbalance indication for the other correction plane.In early electronic balancing devices, calibration could be achieved only after a laborious procedure involving a number of trial runs and the use of trial weights on the rotating body. Subsequently, balancing apparatus was developed in which the unbalance read out for two plane dynamic balancing could be obtained on an initial run without the need for trial weights. Such systems, however, require a number of manual manipulations by the operator such as manual filter tuning to adjust the filter in the balancing equipment to correspond to the speed of rotation of the rotating body and manual entry of right and left calibration weights determined during the calibration procedure. In accordance with the present invention, new and improved electronic balancing apparatus is provided which eliminates the necessity for manual filter tuning and manual entry of right and left calibration weights as well as manual ranging of amount displays. In addition, the system can automatically divide a correction weight between two points into one weight and incorporates automatic ranging of amount displays.The system utilizes a microprocessor and an automatic digital tracking filter which insures that only those vibration signals having a frequency corresponding to the speed of rotation of the rotating body will pass into the analyzer.The above and other objects and features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which form a part of this specification, and in which FIGURE 1 is an elevational view of the control panel for the vibration analyzing apparatus of the invention FIGURE 2 is a block schematic diagram of the vibration analyzing apparatus of the invention andFIGURES 3A 3C, when placed side by side, comprise a schematic circuit diagram of certain portions of the cir cuitry shown in FIGURE 2.With references now to the drawings, and particularly toFIGURE 1, there is shown the face of the control panel for the vibration analyzing apparatus of the invention. Provided on the front face 10 of the control panel are various balancing configurations numbered 1 through 6. In configuration 1, for example, rotor 12 having two balance planes 14 and 16 is supported between spaced bearings 18.In configuration 2, on the other hand, the two balance planes 14 and 16 are on opposite sides of one of the bearings 18. The balance planes 14 and 16 are those planes in which correction weights are to be added. In many rotors, balance weight attachment points, such as threaded holes, are spaced around the periphery of the rotor in each balance plane.On each configuration are three dimensions a, b and c.Dimension a is the distance between one balance plane and the left bearing 18 dimension b is the distance between the other balance plane 16 and the bearing 18 and the dimension c is the spacing between the bearings 18. In setting up a balancing operation, an operator will initially determine which configuration is to be employed, depending upon the type of rotor which is to be balanced and the manner in which it is supported on the two spaced bearings 18.Provided on the front face 10 is a plurality of touchadvance digital switches, one of which is identified by the reference numeral 20 and is designated as a mode switch.While any type of switch may be used in accordance with the present invention, the touch advance digital switches employed herein comprise a lower touch plate 22, an upper touch plate 24 and an intermediate light emitting diode alpha numeric display 26. By momentarily touching the lower plate 22 four times, for example, the numeral displayed on the display 26 will advance through the numerals 1 through 4. On the other hand, the display may be reset to zero by simply touching the upper plate24. In the operation of the analyzing apparatus, the power switch 28 is turned ON the proper configuration, 1 through 6, is selected and after calibration about to be described, the lower plate of switch 20 is touched a number of times corresponding to the number above the selected configuration such that the number appearing in the display 26 will correspond to that of the configuration chosen. Above the mode switch 20 are five sets of switches 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38. Switches 32, 34 and 36 are utilized to introduce into the analyzing equipment the dimensions a, b and c for the particular configuration displayed on display 26. In the example given in FIGURE 1, for example, dimension a comprises 3.5 inches, dimension b comprises 12.5 inches and dimension comprises 23.5 inches.Switches 30 and 38 are utilized to incorporate into the analyzing equipment the radius r at which correction weights are to be added in the two correction planes 14 and 16. In the particular example given inFIGURE 1, for example, this distance is 1.5 inches.Above the switches 30 38 are left angle and amount digital displays 40 and 42, respectively and right angle and amount digital displays 44 and 46. At the top central portion of the panel is a digital RPM meter 48 which displays the speed of the rotor being balanced, usually in revolutions per minute. The amount of a correction weight is displayed in the displays 42 and 46 in either grams or ounces or status couple, depending upon which one of the switches 50 is activated. By touching one of the two switches 52, on the other hand, the meters or displays 42 and 46 will display vibration displacement in mils or microns. The displays 40 and 44 above displays 42 and 46 display the angle at which a correction weight should be added or the angle at which material should be removed from the correction plane at the radius r. If a weight is to be added, for example, the right side of touch switch 54 is contacted whereupon the display 40 will indicate the angle from a reference point on the rotor at which a weight should be added. On the other hand, if the left side of touch switch 54 is contacted, the display 40 will indicate the angle, measured from the aforesaid reference point, at which material should be removed from the rotor so as to balance it. A similar switch 56 is provided for the right plane.In carrying out a balancing operation, a single configuration 1 through 6 is initially selected and the dimensions then entered on switches 30 38. Thereafter, the initiate switch 58 is contacted whereupon the system initially automatically calibrates itself. At the end of the calibration step, displays 42 and 46 indicate that the system is ready to start a balancing operation. After calibration, the rotor 62 is caused to rotate whereupon displays 40 46 will read out the amounts and angles for vibration displacement in the left and right planes. The vibration analyzing system retains the information previously established by touching the read hold switch 60. With the vibration displacement held, the rotor may be stopped. The correction amounts and angles may be displayed by touching the appropriate correction mode switch 50.Should it become necessary to change any one of the dimensions, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, the correction call out will instantly update itself with the correction.With reference now to FIGURE 2, elements shown therein which correspond to those of FIGURE 1 are identified by like reference numerals at the upper right hand side of the figure. A rotor to be balanced is indicated generally by the reference numeral 62 in FIGURE 2. The system includes vibration pickups 64 and 66 each of which is adapted to produce a displacement vibration signal on lead 68 or 70 at a frequency corresponding to the speed of rotation of the rotor 62. Also adapted to be connected to the bearings, now shown, which support the rotor 62 are calibrating oscillators 62 and 64, each of which is adapted to oscillate one end of the rotor through a known displacement at a known calibration weight and a known radius.Above the rotor 62 is a speed transducer 76, such as a photocell, which is trained on a spot 78 on the rotor, the arrangement being such that each time the rotor rotates through one revolution, a pulse will be produced by the speed transducer 76. As will be understood, the frequency of these pulses corresponds to the speed of rotation of the rotor. The pulses from the speed transducer 76 are applied to the input of a one shot multivibrator 80. The output of one shot multivibrator 80, in turn, is applied to a voltage controlled oscillator connected in a phase locked loop with a counter 84. The voltage controlled oscillator 82 multiplies the frequency of the input pulses from the one shot multivibrator 80 by 256 and the counter 84 counts these pulses and produces output digital signals on leads 86 representative of 256 times the input frequency.At the same time, a feedback on lead 88 from the counter 84 to the voltage controlled oscillator operates through a phase detector, in a manner hereinafter described, to lock the oscillator at a frequency of 256 times the input frequency of pulses from multivibrator 80.The outputs from counter 84 on leads 86 are applied to a sine read only memory 90 as well as a cosine read only memory 92 which are simply.read only memories programmed to produce trig tables containing n point sinusoids. The outputs of the two memory circuits, in turn, are applied to combination multipliers and digital to analog converters 94 and 96, respectively, which produce output sine wave signals represented as VR sin sot and VR cos t, respectively, where v is the speed or rotation of the rotor 62. These are passed through high pass filters 98 and 100, the VR sin LJ t signals being applied to analog multipliers 102 and 104 and the VR cos Vt signals being applied to analog multipliers 106 and 108.Reverting again to the upper left hand corner of FIGURE 2, the vibration displacement signals on leads 68 and 70 are applied through two buffer stages 110 and 112 to integrators 114 and 116, respectively. The outputs of the integrators, in turn, are applied through two high pass filters 118 and 120, the output of filter 118 being applied to multipliers 102 and 106 and the output of filter 120 being applied to multipliers 104 and 108.The output of filter 118 can be represented as Vu sin t R where R represents the phase displacement of the right plane vibration signal from the signal VR sin t at the output of filter 98. The output of filter 120 can be represented as Vu sinOt where L represents the phase displacement of the left plane vibration signal from the signal at the output of filter 98.In this regard, it will be appreciated that the angles and L are those at which the unbalance points in the right and left planes are displaced from the mark 78 on rotor 62.The multipliers 102 108 may be of the type manufactured byAnalog Devices, Inc. and identified as their AD532 phasemeter. The two inputs to multiplier 102, for example, are Vu sin t t and VR sin t The output signal E from the multiplier is represented by 0 E0 VuVR sin it sin t cos R cos t sin or Eo 10 sinê t cos R sin t cos At sin or Eo 20 1 cos 2 Al t cos R sin 2 t sin When the vibration and reference signals are in phase VuVR VVR Eo 20 cos R 20 However, when the two signals are not in phase, the voltage output varies as the sine function.The operation of the multiplier 106 is the same as that of multiplier 102 except that the reference signals is nowVR cos lit rather than VR sin t. The outputs of multipliers 102 and 104 are filtered through low pass filters 109 to produce direct current signals representative of the real amount of the unbalance in the right and left balancing planes while the outputs of multipliers 106 and 108, after balancing in filters 111 comprise direct current signals proportional to the imaginary amount of the unbalance in the right and left balancing planes. This can best be understood from the following diagram EMI8.1 where V represents the absolute unbalance at an angle with respect to the mark 78 on the rotor 62 and VRe and V1 represent the real and imaginary amounts of the unbalance at the outputs of the multipliers. From the two direct current signals representing the right angle vectors VRe and VI, the amount and phase angle of the true or absolute unbalance vector V is calculated from straightforward trigonometric equations in the microprocessor 130.It will be appreciated from the equations given above that while the multipliers 102 108 comprise phase detectors and produce output signals which are proportional to the phase difference between a reference signal and avibration signal, they also act as synchronous filters. That is, when the quantity, tA , in the expression Vu sine representing the vibration signal is not equal to the same quantity in the expression VR expression v sin t or VR cos 3 t representing the reference signal, the outputs of the multipliers will drop to zero. Consequently, only true vibration signals corresponding in frequency to the speed of rotation of the rotor will pass through the multipliers and all other frequencies will be filtered out.The outputs of the low pass filters 109 and 111 are applied through analog to digital converters 122 through 128 and the outputs of the converters 122 128 are applied to a microprocessor 130. Also applied to the microprocessor are the control signals from the various pushbutton switches on panel 125 previously described and the dimensions a, b and c and the radii r from the control panel 127. The output of the microprocessor is coupled to panel 127 as well as to the display panel 129 which contains the angle. and amount meters previously described as well as the RPM meter 48 which is connected to the output of counter 84. The microprocessor 130 is also connected to a calibration circuit 131 which actuates the mechanical oscillators 74 and 84 to initially calibrate the system in a manner hereinafter described.Let it be assumed that the radii r and the dimensions a, b and c for configuration 1 shown in FIGURE 1 have been entered on the switches 30 38. To initially calibrate the system as described above, the initiation switch 58 shown inFIGURE 1, which is connected to the microprocessor 130 ofFIGURE 2, is touched. At this time, the rotor 62 is not rotating.with reference to FIGURE 3A, the microprocessor 130 actuates a latch circuit 132 to disconnect lead 134 from speed transducer 76 and connect it, via switch 136, to calibration circuitry generally indicated by the reference numeral 138.The calibration circuitry 138 includes a transformer 140 connected to a 60 hertz input source, the secondary winding on transformer 140 being connected to a Schmitt trigger circuit 142. The output of the Schmitt trigger circuit 142, in turn, is connected to a divider 144 which divides by five, thereby producing on lead 146 a signal having a frequency of 12 hertz which is representative of 720 revolutions per minute of the rotor 62, this being the calibration speed assumed. The calibration signal on lead 134 is applied through an amplifier 148 to the one shot multivibrator 80 previously described in connection with FIGURE 2.The output of the one shot multivibrator, in turn, is applied to the voltage controlled oscillator 82 coupled to counter 84 which feeds back a signal via the lead 88 to a phase detecting filter 150 incorporated into the voltage controlled oscillator 82 such that if the frequency at the output of the oscillator 82 should vary, the feedback on lead 88 will effect any necessary correction.At the same time, the microprocessor 130, through circuit 131 shown in FIGURE 2, initially causes the mechanical oscillator 74 for the right plane to oscillate the right end of the rotor 62 being balanced. The oscillator 74 effects an oscillation in the right end of the rotor through a known displacement at a known weight and radius. Similarly, the mechanical oscillator 72 for the left.plane is next caused to oscillate.During the calibration step, the microprocessor performs the following calculations JR c x2 X1c 1 X1 X2 lce X2ce JL c JR 2 c b JL A 2 cue 2 2ce c JR R a B X1 X1 a Xlce c C X2 X2 X2ce c b 5 c a D Xlce X1 Xlce c JR 6 L CXL AXR WLRL WCRC BC AD 7 BXR DXL WRRR WCRC BC AD 8 In the foregoing equations, the various symbols have the following meanings X1 displacement in right plane under the influence of mechanical oscillator 74 Xlce cross effect displacement in the left plane while the mechanical oscillator 74 is operative X2 displacement in left plane under the effect of oscillator 72 X2ce cross effect in right plane from oscillator 72 J the distance between the right support bearing and the center of gravity of the rotor JL the distance between the left support bearing and the center of gravity of the rotor a, b and c correspond to the dimensions for a particular configuration shown in FIGURE It WC known calibration weight RC the radius at which the calibration rate is rotating to oscillate the rotor during calibration conditions WL and WR the necessary correction weights for the left and right planes, respectively and and RR the radii at which the correction weights are to be added to the left and right planes, these corresponding to the radii r shown in FIGURE 1.It will be appreciated, of course1 that only one oscillator 72 or 74 is actuated at any one time.From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that once the system is calibrated, only the quantities WL and WR are unknown such that the microprocessor can solve Equations 7 and 8 above to determine the correction weights for the two correction planes selected. Once the system has been calibrated, the calibration weights will be displayed on the amount meters 42 and 46 and after the calibration has been completed, a signal will appear on the amount meters 42 and 46 indicating that calibration has been completed and that the system is now.ready to start a balancing operation. At this point, the configuration 1 through 6 is set by the switch 20 and the rotor 62 is caused to rotate by manually actuating a drive motor, not shown. At this point, the foregoing equations are solved by the microprocessor 130 to indicate on the meters 42 and 46 the amount of unbalance in the two balance planes and the angles from the spot 78 on the rotor 62 at which the balance weight are to be added.It will be noted in FIGURE 3B that the leads 68 and 70 from the two vibration detectors 64 and 66 are connected to ground through a voltage divider 152, portions of which can be shunted by means of switches 154. The switches 154, in turn, are connected to three solenoid coils 156 whose energization is controlled by circuits 158, 160 and 162 which are, in turn, connected to the microprocessor 130 shown in FIGURE 1. Depending upon the magnitude of the input displacement signal, one or more of the switches 154 will be properly actuated to establish the range of displacement signals which are displayed by the meters 42 and 46. In FIGURE 3C, elements corresponding to those of FIGURE 2 are identified by like reference numerals.The procedure to be followed in an actual balancing operation is as follows a A balancing procedure is initiated by turning the powerON via switch 28 and by touching the initiate switch 58.This automatically clears the memory of the microprocessor 130 and causes the microprocessor, through the calibration circuit 131, to initially actuate one calibrating oscillator 72 or 74 followed by actuation of the other oscillator.During this time, the calibration quantities given inEquations 1 through 8 above are stored in the micro processor s memory. When this operation is complete, the meters 42 and 46 will display the word RUN . b The balancing configuration of the part to be balanced i.e., configurations 1 through 6 in FIGURE 1 is then selected and the switch 20 pushed to advance the numeral displayed thereon to the proper configuration chosen. c The actual dimensions a, b and c are then taken from the rotor being balanced and the push switches 32, 34 and 36 are advanced to indicate the measurements taken. d The radii where the correction weights are to be added on the left and right sides of the rotor are then measured and entered on the switches 30 and 38. In English units, the radii are set to the nearest tenth of an inch while in metric units, the radii must be in millimeters and set to the nearest millimeter. e When all of the values have been entered on switches 30 38 and calibration is complete with the displays 42 and 46 indicating RUN the rotor 62 shown in FIGURE 2 is brought up to the desired balancing speed by a motor and drive system, not shown. The actual rotational speed of the rotor is indicated on the display 48 shown in FIGURE 1.During this time, the switch 60 is positioned to be in the READ mode and the displays 42 and 46 indicate the actual amounts or magnitudes of the unbalance signals in the right and left planes and the displays will indicate the angles from reference point 78 at which weights should be added or removed, depending upon the state of switches 54 and 56. f Initially, the amount readings on meters 42 and 46 will vacillate however when the operator is satisfied that the vibrations are steady, he can capture them and cause them to be stored in the memory of microprocessor 130 by touching the switch 60 such that it is in the HOLD mode. The rotor 62 can now be stopped and need no longer be rotated. Since the amount and angle information is now stored in the microprocessor 130, corrections can be made to any of the dimensions displayed by the switches 30 38 without again rotating the rotor 62. g Desired vibration and correction data are then displayed on the displays 42 and 44 by touching the appropriate switches 50 or 52. h When placing a correction weight on the rotor 62, the angular location is found by rotating the phase reference mark on the rotor a number of degrees corresponding to that displayed by the left and right angle displays 40 and 42, in the direction of rotation. The correction weights can then be added or material removed from the top dead center of the rotor depending upon the position of the touch switches 54 and 56. i After adding or subtracting weights in the right and left planes of the rotor being balanced, the operator causes the rotor 62 to again rotate and observes the readings on displays 40 46. In most cases, and because the weights added may not be of exactly the desired weight or the angle at which they are placed on the rotor may vary slightly, there will be at least some residual vibration displayed on the displays. If this vibration magnitude, however, falls within permissible tolerances, the balancing operation is complete. If not, new vibration data is stored in the microprocessor 130 by pushing the switch 60 such that it is in the HOLD mode. Additional correction weights or removal of material can then be added as previously discussed until the vibration tolerance is met.In certain cases, there may be only certain tapped holes equally spaced around the rotor into which correction weights can be threaded. Similarly, in the case of a bladed turbine, for example, the correction weight will have to be added to one of the blades since it cannot be supported in the space between them. The correction vector, however, may be located in between blades or in between tapped holes. In this case, it is desirable to resolve this single vector into two vectors which intersect the blades or the tapped holes. Assume, for example, that there are twelve tapped holes spaced around the left or right balancing plane, meaning that the holes are separated by 30 . Assume further that the correction vector is at an angle of 1700 with respect to the reference point on the rotor.This means, of course, that the correction vector is at an angle of 100 with respect to the tapped hole diametrically opposite the mark on the rotor and 200 from the next tapped hole in the counterclockwise direction. With this information, the microprocessor can perform a single trigonometric computation to resolve the single vector into two vectors which intersect adjacent tapped holes or adjacent blades, as the case may be.In order to perform the foregoing operation, the touch switch 20 is set to an arbitrary number other than 1 through 6 and in this case it will be assumed that in order to resolve the right plane vector into two, the switch 20 is set to 0 . The microprocessor is programmed such that if the number of weight addition points is entered on switch 34 as shown in FIGURE 1, the computer will automatically resolve the one vector into two vectors whose amounts and angles are displayed on the displays 40 46. The angles, of course, will correspond to the locations of two adjacent weight addition points in the left or right plane, as the case may be.Alternatively, if it has been found necessary to add two correction weights to the rotor, it may be desirable to resolve these into one. Under these circumstances, the angles and amounts of the two correction weights in the left plane, for example, are manually recorded during the balancing operation. In order to resolve the two corrections into one, the touch switch 20 is arbitrarily advanced to 7 , for example. Thereafter, the read hold switch 60 is set to the HOLD mode and the standard gram switch 50 is set to the ON position. At this point, the magnitude of one of the two correction vectors is entered in touch switch 30 while the angle of the vector is entered on touch switch 32. The microprocessor 130 is programmed such that these amounts will now be displayed on the right displays 44 and 46. The touch switch 60 is now actuated to assume the READ mode and the information is stored in the microprocessor memory.At the same time, the microprocessor is programmed to transfer the angle and amount of the aforesaid first vector to the left displays 40 and 42. The magnitude and angle of the second vector is now entered on switches 30 and 32 as before and the switch 60 again set to the READ mode. Stored in the memory of the microprocessor 130 are now the amounts and angles of the two vectors. Again, by a relatively simple trigonometric computation, the sum of the two vectors is computed in the microprocessor and now displayed on the left displays 40 and 42. It is, of course, well within the skill of the art to program the microprocessor 130 to perform the foregoing calculations.Although the invention has been shown in connection with a certain specific embodiment, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and arrangement of parts may be made to suit requirements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
