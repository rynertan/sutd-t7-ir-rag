## Description
The invention described herein was made, in part, in the course of work under research grants numbers HL 30649 and HL 30648, from the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Public Health Service. The present invention relates to interaction of human platelets with blood vessels mediated by von Willebrand factor. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of particular synthetic peptides for the manufacture of compositions for inhibiting thrombin or ADP induced binding of von Willebrand factor to human platelets as well as the construction of a synthetic molecule capable of initiating the adhesion reaction linking human platelets to blood vessels. A number of different mechanisms have been disclosed which lead to the initiation of blood clots thrombi . One such mechanism is the thrombin or ADP induced platelet binding of the multivalent molecules, fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor. Thrombin or ADP induce modification of the platelet structure, allowing interaction between the platelets and fibrinogen to form aggregates and binding of von Willebrand factor by the platelets to initiate adhesion or linking to blood vessels. Von Willebrand factor is also involved in the ristocetin induced aggregation clumping of platelets. While the exact mechanisms are not clear, one theory is that thrombin, ADP or ristocetin cause stereochemical changes in the glycoproteins of the placelet cell membrane. The stereochemical changes create receptor sites on the platelet so that platelet binding regions on the fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor molecules can react with the receptor site. Until recently, the mechanisms of binding of human fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor to human platelets were unknown. In 1982, Hawiger, Timmons, Kloczewiak, Strong and Doolittle demonstrated that the primary fibrinogen interaction site with human platelets is located on the gamma chain of fibrinogen. In 1983 Kloczewiak Both fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor are important in the formation of hemostatic platelet plugs and initiation of thrombotic lesions. Blockage caused by these plugs and the damage caused by thrombotic lesions are major factors in heart disease and stroke. Much research has been directed toward developing drugs which will dissolve already formed blood clots but most of these drugs have not been particularly effective. Recently, reports on the use of tissue plasminogen activator, a molecule which modifies circulating plasminogen molecules to form plasmin, an enzyme that dissolves blood clots, have been given much publicity. While enzymatic methods of dissolving clots may help minimize the after effects of heart attacks, a pharmaceutical preparation which will inhibit platelet adhesion prior to occlusion of the blood vessels may prevent the initial blockage responsible for cardiac or cerebral infarction. Alternatively, molecules promoting platelet adhesion to blood vessels may have a variety of uses. For example, a number of patients, e.g., some bleeders, may be lacking von Willebrand factor due to a genetic deficiency or due to excessive consumption in circulation. A synthetic platelet adhesion promoting molecule can assist in platelet plug formation and attachment of plugs to blood vessels to arrest bleeding and help these patients to lead normal lives. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to develop a method of inhibiting platelet binding of von Willebrand factor promoted by thrombin, ADP or other stimuli. Another object of the invention is to provide a molecule which promotes platelet interaction with blood vessels. A further object of the invention is to provide a synthetic molecule which inhibits platelet binding of von Willebrand factor with significant circulation time in the blood stream. These and other objects and features of the invention will be apparent from the summary, the drawing and the description. The present invention provides the use of a synthetic peptide which is analogous to the binding domain of von Willebrand factor and contains 6 14 residues having a carboxyl terminal sequence The invention further features the use of a peptide for the manufacture of a composition for inhibiting thrombin or ADP induced binding of von Willebrand factor to human platelets wherein, said peptide is analogous to the binding domain of von Willebrand factor and is a synthetic molecule having the molecule having the carboxyl terminal sequence The invention also features the use of a molecule for the manufacture of a composition for promoting interaction or human platelets with blood vessels in the absence of von Willebrand factor, said molecule formed of a plurality of peptide molecules having the carboxyl terminal sequence The sole figure of the drawing illustrates the inhibition of ADP modified platelet binding of von Willebrand factor caused by incubation with a peptide of the invention. The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that a primary attachment site on the fibrinogen molecule in the thrombin or ADP induced fibrinogen aggregation of human platelets is located in the twelve carboxyl terminal residues of the gamma chain. Surprisingly, the same dodecapeptide which inhibits aggregation of fibrinogen and platelets also inhibits thrombin or ADP induced binding of von Willebrand factor to human platelets. One possibility for this phenomenom is that the thrombin or ADP modified platelets have a binding site for von Willebrand factor which has a similar stereochemical structure as the fibrinogen site. These discoveries provide the basis for a method of inhibiting binding of von Willebrand factor to human platelets induced with thrombin, ADP, or other stimuli as well as providing the basis for the fabrication of molecules which can promote or inhibit interaction of platelets with blood vessels. The synthetic peptides described herein were synthesized in a manual shaker apparatus Chipco Manufacturing following the solid phase procedure of Barany and Merrifield described in Cysteine containing peptides were converted to cystine cross linked peptides by oxidation with the potassium ferricyanide. The cysteine containing peptide was dissolved in 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at approximately 10mg ml and was mixed with a 2 M excess of potassium ferricyanide and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After acidification, the peptide was mixed with AGI x 8 Bio Rad resin to remove inorganic reagents and the supernatent was rechromatographed on an analytical column. The resulting main peptide peak was collected and freeze dried. The synthetic adhesion promoting molecule was formed by dissolving 10 mg ml human serum albumin Miles Laboratories in 0.1 M Na The following Example illustrate the efficiency of the invention. This Example uses the reagents formed by the procedures delineated above. This Example illustrates that the method of the invention can be used to inhibit binding of von Willebrand factor to ADP treated human platelets. Figure 1 illustrates the level of inhibition of 125I von Willebrand factor binding to ADP modified human platelets by incubation with a synthetic dodecapeptide The Figure also illustrates that the same dodecapeptide does not inhibit the binding of 125I von Willebrand factor to ristocetin modified human platelets. Specifically, Figure 1 shows that addition of various levels of the dodecapeptide to 10⁸ human platelets 0.55ml treated with 5 µM of ADP five minutes prior to the addition of 14 µg of 125I labelled von Willebrand factor or 33 µg of 125I labelled fibrinogen will cause substantial binding inhibition. The Figure also shows that the dodecapeptide does not inhibit the binding of 125I labelled von Willebrand factor to human platelets treated with 0.6 mg ml ristocetin . One explanation for these results is that the binding of the dodecapeptide to the ADP modified human platelets prohibits binding of fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor by sterically blocking the protein binding site. However, the ristocetin modified human platelets are not hindered in binding von Willebrand factor. This experiment suggests that ristocetin causes a different modification of the platelets than ADP or thrombin so that von Willebrand factor binds to ristocetin modified platelets through a different binding site than it does to ADP or thrombin treated platelets. These experiments indicate that distinct binding domains on von Willebrand factor can participate in its binding to human platelets modified with thrombin, ADP, or ristocetin. Small peptides analogous to these domains can block one or two binding sites responsible for interaction of von Willebrand factor with platelets. A potential problem with the use of small peptides as a method of preventing interaction between platelets and von Willebrand factor is that small peptides are cleared from the bloodstream in a very short time. By conjugating the synthetic peptides to human serum albumin at a concentration of no more than one peptide per albumin molecule, a larger, hopefully more stable, platelet adhesion inhibitory molecule can be formed.
