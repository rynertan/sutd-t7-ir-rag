In freshly prepared zeolite FU9, R may include an alkali metal cation especially sodium, and or ammonium, and usually or when prepared from nitrogen compounds, includes nitrogen containing organic cations as described below or cationic degradation products thereof, or precursors thereof. These nitrogen containing compounds are hereinafter referred to as Q. The freshly prepared zeolite FU9 may also contain nitrogen containing compounds well in excess of the 1.5 moles set out in the aforesaid definition of the composition of zeolite FU9, typically in the range 0.1 to 20 moles per mole of Y2O3. Since FU9 is a zeolite, the nitrogen containing base must be physically trapped within the crystal lattice. It can be removed by thermal or oxidative degradation or by displacement by suitable small molecules. This physically trapped basic material does not constitute part of the composition for the purposes of definition. Thus a zeolite FU9 as made typically has the following molar composition O to 0.8 M20 0.1 to 20 Q Y203 10 to 30 X02 0 to 600 H20 wherein M is an alkali metal or ammonium and M20 Q is equal to or greater than 1.0. The H20 content of freshly prepared zeolite FU9 depends on the conditions in which it has been dried after synthesis. In calcined forms of zeolite FU9, R may be alkali metal but includes less or no nitrogen containing organic compounds, since these are burnt out in the presence of air, leaving hydrogen as the other balancing cation, or otherwise displaced prior to calcination. Among the ion exchanged forms of zeolite FU9 the ammonium NH4 is of importance since it can be readily converted to the hydrogen form by calcination. The hydrogen form can also be prepared directly by exchange with an acid. The hydrogen form and forms containing metals introduced by ion exchange are described further below. We believe that FU9 is a member of the ferrierite family of zeolites, which comprises, also naturally occurring ferrierite as well as zeolite SrD J Chem Soc 1964 485 and ZSM35 US Patent 4,016,245 . From X ray diffraction data shown in Table 2, it seems unlikely that all of these zeolites are based on variations on the ferrierite framework which was derived by P A Vaughan Acta Cryst 1966 21 983 . The best fit to the calculated data from the Vaughan structure is given by zeolite FU9, virtually all the predicted lines are present in FU9. Also FU9 data gives an excellent fit to the predicted orthorhombic unit cell. Further comfirmation of these differences is provided by electron microscopy and electron diffraction studies. Under the electron microscope, ferrierite is shown to consist of irregular pieces of various sizes ranging from less than 1 micron to over 4 microns in length, ZSM35 consists of very thin rods and FU9 of regular small crystals. Natural ferrierite and ZSM35 are shown to be closely related having a similar faulted structure with fault lines perpendicular to the b axis.Zeolite FU9 appears as an idealised structure containing no apparent faults. Still further confirmation of these differences comes from results obtained from sorption and catalytic studies, and even from the preparation and compositional properties. Comparisons of sorptive behaviour are given inTables 3 and 4. The Vaughan structure for ferrierite has 10 ring tunnels running down the c axis, and 8 ring tunnels along the b axis. The voidage available is approximately 16 cc per g of zeolite. From Tables 3 and 4 it can be seen that there are significant differences in sorptive behaviour between the ferrierite family members. From Table 4 it is clear that voidages in the various ferrierites are available to markedly different extents for molecules larger than methanol, water voidages are similar, and suggest part of the framework is hydrophobic, since the level is only 60 70 of that for methanol. However, voidages available to cyclic compounds differ substantially and for FU9 it seems possible that only the 10 ring tunnel system is available for n hexane sorption whereas all the voidage appears to be available in the other forms of ferrierite.With reference to sorption of xylene isomers,FU9 is nearer to zeolite SrD than to ZSM35 or small port tetra methyl ammonium TMA ferrierite. This suggests zeolite FU9 should be useful in separating xylene isomers.

FU9 can only be prepared with tetramethyl ammonium compounds, optionally with trialkylamines which may be substituted or their salts, or from tetramethylammonium plus degradation products of tetramethylammonium which can include trimethylhydrogen ammonium and trimethylamine. On the other hand ZSM35 can only be prepared from either ethylene diamine or pyrrolidine. While FU9 can only be prepared with Si02jA1203 product ratios from 15 to 30,ZSM35 can be prepared with Si02A1203 ratios from 8 to 50.Attempts to produce FU9 with Si02 A1203 less than 15 result in the production of zeolite FUl and attempts to synthesise FU9 with Si02 Al203 30 give rise to FU9 of Si02 Al203 30 and substantial quantities of a quartz.Attempts to produce FU9 using only tetramethylammonium can give rise to the production of either zeolite FU1 or small port TMA ferrierite. Yet another difference between FU9 and ZSM35 is found in xylene isomerisation reactions. FU9 isomerizes m xylene to much higher levels of p xylene than the thermodynamic equilibrium level, i.e. there is a kinetic control in operation in FU9 allowing preferential production of p xylene. This is not so in ZSM35 because quite normal equilibrium mixtures are produced. Further differences were observed in toluene disproportionation reactions at 000C. In thermal dealkylation reactions the prepared isomer distribution is 2 1 o xylene p xylene. However, in the presence of an acidic catalyst this normally reverts to standard xylene equilibrium mixtures viz. 2.3 5.2 2.5 o xylene m xylene p xylene. This is indeed the case for SSM 35.However, when using FU9,p xylene is first formed preferentially and some p xylene then isomerizes to m xylene. That is, the dealkylation andisomerisation mechanism on FU9 is abnormal and quite different to that shown by the ZSM35 which behaves in a conventional manner. Finally there is a significant difference in the infra red spectra of FU9 and ZSM35. FU9 has a single broad peak at 450 cm 1, whereas ZSM35 has very well defined double peaks at 465 and 440 cm 1 The invention provides also a method of making zeolite FU9 which comprises reacting an aqueous mixture comprising at least one oxide X02, at least one oxideY203 and at least one tetramethylammonium compound. The reaction mixture preferably has the following molar composition X02 Y203 5 to 50 preferably 10 to 30 free M02 X02 0.1 to 1.0 preferably 0.1 to 0.5Z Y203 0 to 5000 preferably 10 to 100Q Y203 0.1 to 150 preferably 1 to 50H20 X02 5 to 200 preferably 10 to 30Q TMA 2 xA where X is silicon and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, gallium, iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic, manganese or boron, M is an alkali metal or ammonium, and Q is a mixture of TMA the tetramethylammonium compound, amine degradation product thereof or a precursor thereof, or 2 related compound, and A which is a trialkylamine and or an alkanolamine or salts thereof, where x is equal to 0.2 to 2.0 moles and A preferably contains 1 to 12 carbon atoms.Z is a strong acid radical present as a salt of M and may be added as a free acid to reduce the freeM20 level to a desired value. M and or Q can be present as hydroxides or salts of inorganic acids provided theM20 X02 requirement is fulfilled. The preferred quaternary compound is a tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide. The preferred alkylamines are trimethlamine, triethylamine or tributylamine. The preferred alkali metal M is sodium. The preferred oxide X02 is silica Si02 and the preferred oxide Y203 is alumina A1203 . The silica source can be any of those commonly considered for use in synthesising zeolites, for example powdered solid silica. Among the powdered silicas usable are precipitated silicas, especially those made by precipitation from an alkali metal silicate solution, such as the type known as KS 300 made by AKZO, and similar products, aerosil silicas, fume silicas and silica gels suitably in grades for use in reinforcing pigments for rubber or silicone rubber. Colloidal silicas of various particle sizes may be used, for example 10 15 or 40 50 microns, as sold under the Registered Trade Marks LUDOX , NALCOAG and SYTON .The usable dissolved silicas include commercially available waterglass silicates containing 0.5 to 6.0, especially 2.0 to 4.0 mols of SiO2 per mol of alkali metal oxide, active alkali metal silicates as defined in UR Patent 1193254, and silicates made by dissolving silica in an alkali metal hydroxide or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide or a mixture thereof. The alumina source is most conveniently sodium aluminate, but can be or can include aluminium, an aruminium salt for example the chloride, nitrate or sulphate, an aluminium alkoxide or alumina itself, which should preferably be in a hydrated or hydratable form such as colloidal alumina, pseudoboehmite, boehmite, gamma alumina or the alpha or beta trihydrate. The reaction mixture is reacted usually under autogenous pressure, optionally with added gas, e.g.nitrogen at a temperature between 85 and 2500C until crystals of zeolite FU9 form, which can be from 1 hour to many months depending on the reactant composition and the operating temperature. Agitation is optional, but is preferable since it reduces the reaction time. At the end of the reaction, the solid phase is collected on a filter and washed and is then ready for further steps such as drying, dehydration and ionexchange. If the product of the reaction contains alkali metal ions, these have to be at least partly removed in order to prepare the hydrogen form of FU9 and this can be done by ion exchange with an acid, especially a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or by way of the ammonium compound, made by ion exchange with a solution of an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride.Such ion exchange can be carried out by slurrying once or several times with the solution. In general, the cation s of zeolite FU9 can be replaced by any cation s of metals, and particularly those in Groups IA, IB, IIA, IIB, III including rare earths VIII including noble metals and by lead, tin and bismuth. The Periodic Table is as in Abridgements of Specifications published by the UK Patent Office .Exchange is carried out using any water soluble salts containing the appropriate cation. In order to prepare a catalyst zeolite FU9 may be used in association with an inorganic matrix, or with other materials which can be either inert or catalytically active. The matrix may be present simply as a binding agent to hold the small zeolite particles 0.005 to 10 microns together, or it may be added as a diluent to control the amount of conversion in a process which may otherwise proceed at too high a rate, leading to catalyst fouling as a result of excessive coke formation.Typical inorganic diluents include catalyst support materials such as alumina, silica, kaolinic clays, bentonites, montmorrilonites, sepiolite, attapulgite,Fullers earth, synthetic porous materials such as SiO2 A12 3 SiO2 ZrO2, SiO2 ThO2, SiO2 BeO, Si02 TiO2 or any combination of these oxides. An effective way of mixing zeolite FU9 with such diluents is to mix appropriate aqueous slurries in a mixing nozzle and then to spraydry the slurry. Other ways of mixing can be used. If zeolite FU9 in any cationic form or as a catalytic composite is exchanged or impregnated with hydrogenation dehydrogenation components, such as Ni, Co,Pt, Pd, Re, Rh, hydrocracking and reforming catalysts can be made, especially if the Na2O content is less than 0.1 w w A wide range of hydrocarbon conversion catalysts can be prepared from zeolite FU9 by ion exchange or impregnation with cations, or oxides, selected from the following, Cu, Ag, Mg, Ca, Sr Zn, Cd, B, Al, Sn, Pb,V, P, Sb, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Ni noble metals. Usually the FU9 catalyst will be in acid form, thus stoichiometry is maintained by H or H3O as an additional balancing cation, or as sole cation. Such catalysts may find application in the following processes catalytic cracking, hydrodesulphurization, hydrodenitrification, catalytic dewaxing, alkylation of alkanes or aromatics, dealkylation, disproportionation, isomerisation of alkanes and alkyl benzenes, dehydration reactions, oxidation and polymerisation. Reference has already been made to the use of zeolite FU9 as a catalyst in xylenes isomerisation and in toluene disproportionation. It is also useful as a catalyst for the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons rich in light olefins and for the conversion of light olefins to oligomers and aromatic containing liquids useful as transport fuels. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamplesExample 1Preparation of FU9. The synthesis mixture had the following molar composition 4.5 Na20, 3 QCl,A1203, 25 Si02, 900 H20.where Q 90 Ctetramethy lammonium chloride 10 trimethylamine hydrochloride on a molar basis .First 76.1 g AKZO KS 300 silica Na20, 0.187 A1203, 181 Si02, 54.3 H20 were suspended in 11.6 g sodium hydroxide dissolved in 700 g water to give slurry A. Next 15.2 g Q were dissolved in 100 g water to give solution B. Finally 8.1 g sodium aluminate were dissolved in 41 g water to give solution C. Then slurry A was heated with stirring to dissolve most of the silica, next solution B was stirred in followed by Solution C. The mixture was reacted for 24 hours at 180 C in a stirred stainless steel autoclave.After cooling to about 600C the slurry was filtered and washed with 2 litres of distilled water at about 600C and then dried overnight at 1200C. The product was sodium organo FU9 zeolite having typical X ray diffraction data as shown in Table 1, and having the following composition 0.21 Na20, 1.6Q, A1203, 21 SiO2, 5.3 H20. The carbon nitrogen ratio in this product was 3.6. A characteristic of FU9 zeolites as made is that the carbon nitrogen ratio is always in the range 3 to 3.8. Small port TMA ferrierites typified by the product of Example 12 have carbon nitrogen ratios of from 4.1 to 4.4.Example 2In this example, Q was 100 tetramethyl ammonium chloride.The reaction was carried out as before except that samples were taken at 6 hours, 24 hours and 36 hours respectively. The product at 6 hours was zeolite FU1, but at 24 hours, 20 of the FU1 had been converted to zeolite FU9.After 36 hours the product was zeolite FU9. These results demonstrate that the degradation products of tetramethylammonium lead ultimately to the production of FU9 even if the first product is zeolite FU1. Example 3In this example, the reaction mixture was as in Example 1 and was heated at 2300C for 6 hours. The product was again FU9.Example 4In this example, the composition differed from Example 1 in that 100 trimethylamine hydrochloride was sed. The product of this reaction was zeolite ZSM8.Example 5A portion of the product of Example 1 was calcined in moist air at 5500C for 12 hours, its X ray diffraction data was still substantially as given in Table 1 and its composition was 0.21 Na2O, A1203, 20 SiO2 and it contained less than 0.2 w w carbon. This sample was used in the sorption and catalytic work described. Example 6A portion of the product of Example 1 was slurry ion exchanged with 5 ml of 2 N hydrochloric acid per gram at 900C for 1 hour. The product was calcined in moist air for 3 hours at 4500C and had the X ray diffraction data of Table 1 and a composition 0.01 Na20, A1203, 23 SiO2Example 7This example was in Example 1 except that instead of 10 trimethylamine hydrochloride, 7 tributylamine was used.The product was again FU9 of composition 0.1 Na2O, 2.5 Q, A1203, 23.5 SiO2, 7 H20.Example 8In this example, Q comprised 93 tetramethylammonium chloride and 7 triethanolamine and the mixture ratios were as Example 1. The product was again FU9 of composition 0.19 Na20, 1.8Q, A1203, 22 SiO2, 7 H20. Example 9In this example, Q comprised 50 tetramethylammonium chloride and 50 trimethylamine hydrochloride. The mix was otherwise as Example 1 and the product was again FU9.Example 10In this modification of Example 1, potassium hydroxide and potassium aluminate replaced the respective sodium compounds. The reaction was 9 hours at 2300C and the product was potassium organo FU9 with X ray data very similar to the sodium form, differing only marginally in peak positions and peak heights. Its composition was 0.05 Na2O, 0.5 K20, 1.6 Q r A1203, 17.5 SiO2, 8 H20. Example 11This example gives an unsuccessful attempt to synthesiseFU9 having a product ratio SiO2 A1203 30. The molar composition of the reaction mixture was 7.2 Na20, 4.4 TMAC1, 0.4 trimethylamine HC1, 40 Si02, 144 H20.The reactants employed were as in Example 1, the reaction ran for 17 hours at 2250C with intermediate sampling.After 6 and 15 hours the products were amorphous major proportion and a quartz minor . After 17 hours the product was major a quartz and minor zeolite FU9.Example 12This example illustrates the point that FU9 cannot be synthesised with SiO2 A1203 30, but that it is possible to obtain a near tetramethylammonium ferrierite which has X ray data much the same as zeolite SrD. Thus zeolite had small port properties adsorbed 10.8 w water but less than 0.4 w w n hexane. The composition of the reaction mixture was 9 Na20, 10.8 QC1, A1203, 59.3 SiO2, 26 NaCl, 2000 H20Q was as in Example 1.The reaction after 72 hours at 2500C gave SrD zeolite of composition 0.3 Na2O, 2.5Q, A1203r 47 SiO2, 16H20 and the carbon nitrogen ratio was 4.3. Example 13This example illustrates the fact that if insufficient organic base is employed in FU9 type reactions, then the result can be small port ferrierite. The mixture was as follows with Q as in Example 1.4 Na20, QC1, A1203, 25 SiO2, 900 H20The product after 9 hours at 2300C was small port ferrierite as in Example 2.Example 14The reaction mixture composition was 4.2 Na20, 3 OC1, A1203, 18 SiO2, 900 H20Q was as in Example 1. The reaction was for 72 hours at 1800C. The product was FU9 of composition 0.3 Na20, 1.5Q, A1203, 14.8 SiO2, 4 H20Example 15The reaction mixture composition was 6.8 Na20, 4.8 QC1, A1203, 40 Si02, 1440 H20Q was as in Example 1. The reaction was for 24 hours at 18O0C, the product was FU9 of composition 0.5 Na2O, 1.9Q, A1203, 29 Si02, 9H20Example 16This example illustrates the use of zeolite FU9 as a xylene isomerisation catalyst.H FU9 200g , pelleted in the absence of binder, into cylinders 3.2 mm , was charged into a semi technical scale reactor and was used to isomerise a xylene feedstock consisting of toluene 2.01 , ethylbenzene 8.97 , para xylene 8.23 , meta xylene 50.14 and orthoxylene 25.56 . The reactor pressure was 0.72 bar and the reactor temperature in the range 4200C to 44O0C. The results of the isomerisation experiment are shown inTable 5.The results illustrate that FU9 is capable of isomerising a meta xylene rich stream to produce para xylene at low xylene loss.

The catalyst performance was studied at various space velocities, and the composition of the xylene products at similar on stream times is shown in Table 6.

H FU9 lOg, 3.2 mm cylinders was used to catalyse the methylation of toluene with methanol 2 1, toluene methanol molar . The results are given in Table 7.

Ortho xylene is in fact favoured by zeolite ZSM 35 and this example illustrates a catalytic difference between the two zeolites.Example 19This example illustrates that H FU9 can be used to convert ethylbenzene to lighter and heavier products.H FU9 lOg, 3.2 mm cylinders was used to convert ethylbenzene in a laboratory sized unit WHSV in 1.1 hr l, tempr 4500C . After one hour on stream the products were sampled and analysed and showed that 12.4 of the ethylbenzene had been converted to benzene 8.0 , toluene 0.6 and heavier products 3.8 . After a half hour on stream, the conversion of ethylbenzene was 22.7 , with the products benzene 16.3 , toluene 1.4 and heavier products 4.8 , this would suggest that the zeolite would be best employed in a fluid or moving bed technology where the residence time of the catalyst is less than one hour.Example 20This example illustrates the use of H FU9 to disproportion ate toluene to benzene and xylene.H FU9 lOg, 3.2 mm cylinders was used to disproportionate toluene in a laboratory reactor. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 8. The results show thatH FU9 can be used to disproportionate toluene to benzene and xylenes. It will be noticed that the products are slightly enriched relative to the thermodynamic equilibrium in the valuable isomer of xylene namely para xylene.Example 21This example describes the conversion of light olefins to heavier products over H FU9.H FU9 lOg, 3.2 mm cylinders was used to study the conversion of propylene in a laboratory scale unit. At 250 C the propylene gave a liquid product which was thought to consist mainly of propylene dimers, the major products being cis and trans 2 methyl pent 3 ene. At higher temperatures 4500C , methyl aromatics were observed in the products.In a similar experiment, 1,4 butadiene was passed overH FU9 zeolite at 2400C. This also gave a liquid product containing over thirty components.These two experiments illustrate the use of H FU9 in converting olefins to oligomers and to aromatic containing liquids which potentially could be used as transport fuels.Example 22This example illustrates the use of FU9 in converting oxygenates, e.g. methanol, to useful hydrocarbons, especially light olefins.H FU9 O.2g, 80 100 mesh was charged into a microreactor and used for the conversion of methanol into hydrocarbons.methanol was passed over the zeolite from a syringe pump WHSV, 2.37 hr l and a small amount of diluent nitrogen 7ml min l was also passed through the reactor. The reactor temperature was 3810C.

The product, after drying, was calcined at 5000C.The experiment of example 22 was repeated except thatZn FU9 was used in place of the H FU9 and the diluent gas was hydrogen instead of nitrogen. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 9 and were gathered using a methanol feed rate WHSV of 0.72 hr l. The results show that methanol is converted to light hydrocarbons rich in ethylene and propylene the results also show that methanol produces aromatic hydrocarbons as well as aliphatic moieties.Example 24This example further illustrates the use of zeolite FU9 in converting methanol into useful hydrocarnon products rich in ethylene and propylene.The experiment of example 22 was repeated except that the space velocity of the methanol feed WHSV was ca 2.8 hr l and the reactor temperature was near to 3800C.After 10 min on line, analysis of the product showed it to consist of methane 2.1 wt ethylene 5.2 ethane 0.3 TABLE 9CONVERSION OF METHANOL OVER Zn FU9LIGHT PRODUCT ANALYSIS HYDROCARBON PRODUCTS EMI22.1 Min SEP Temp SEP CH4 SEP C2H4 SEP C2H6 SEP C3H6 SEP C3H8 SEP C4 SEP MeOH SEP C1,2 SEP C3 SEP C4 SEP C5 SEP T SEP X SEP C9 A tb SEP and tb SEP DME tb SEP 5 SEP 353 SEP 8.4 SEP 12.1 SEP 4.6 SEP 39.4 SEP 35.5 SEP nil tb SEP 8 SEP 353 SEP 15.5 SEP 31.7 SEP 16.2 SEP 33.3 SEP 0.5 SEP 1.2 SEP 1.6 tb 10 SEP 353 SEP 22.0 SEP 16.4 SEP 5.2 SEP 24.3 SEP 17.3 SEP 14.6 SEP nil tb 25 SEP 353 SEP 11.4 SEP 10.9 SEP 4.2 SEP 36.5 SEP 36.9 SEP nil tb 41 SEP 353 SEP 9.1 SEP 5.3 SEP 2.3 SEP 16.3 SEP 36.2 SEP nil tb 43 SEP 353 SEP 16.8 SEP 13.6 SEP 17.6 SEP 50.1 SEP 0.6 SEP 0.9 SEP 0.4 tb 0 is process timeLight products analysis on Porapak Porapak is a trade mark column to C4 only analysis not corrected for low response of oxygenates.Hydrocarbon products analysis on OV101 column to C15 aromatics.C1,2,C3,C4,C5 are alphatics.T TolueneX XylenesC9 A C8 aromatics propylene 42.5 propane nilC4 aliphatics 15.2 C5 aliphatics 59.2 oxygenates nil toluene 0.4 xylene 1.8 Cg aromatics 0.9 What we claim is
