## Description
Process for the Preparation of Hydroxvphenvlhydantoin This invention relates to a process for the prep tion of 5 p hydroxyphenyl hydantoin, which is a usef intermediate in the preparation of hydroxyphenylgly For example, British Patent No. 1,506,067 describes t preparation of D N carbamoyl p hydroxyphenylglycin the corresponding amino acid, D p hydroxyphenylgly by selective enzymatic hydrolysis of D,L 5 p hydroxy hydantoin. The D p hydroxyphenylglycine is useful an intermediate for the preparation of the penicillin amoxycillin. 5 E5Hydroxyphenyl hydantoin is known from Hazel and Herbst, J. Org. Chem. Vol. 19, 1944, pp. 21 30., as being prepared by heating p hydroxybenzaldehyde, potassium cyanide and ammonium carbonate in aqueous a holic solution. The disadvantage of this method for commercial process is the availability and cost of tb starting material, p hydroxybenzaldehyde. The presen invention relates to a process which employs readily lable and economical starting materials. According to the present invention there is prow a process for the preparation of 5 p hydro xyphenyl EMI1.1 hydantoin of formula I EMI2.1 which process comprises reacting phenol with glyoxylic acid and urea in the presence of an acid catalyst in an aqueous medium. Although these three reagents have been used in various combinations in the past, the prior art does not suggest that they can be used to produce compound I above. In fact, the prior art teaches away from such a process. For example, Ben Ishai et al Tetrahedron, Vol.33, 1191 1977 discloses that, whereas reaction of an N substituted urea, NH2. CO. NHCH3, with glyoxylic acid can give a hydantoin of formula it5 EMI2.2 reaction of glyoxylic acid or a derivative with urea itself in methanol gives a non cyclic compound of formula III EMI2.3 British Patent No. 1,435,268, in the name ofSmithkline Corporation, discloses inter alia the pr preparation of N carbamyl 2 p hydroxvphenyl glycine of formula IV by reacting phenol with glyoxylic acid and urea, without solvent.EMI3.1 Ben Ishai et al Tetrahedron, Vol. 33, 3261 1977 3 also describes the preparation of a substitutedN carbamyl p hydroxyphenylglycine of formula V by reaction of phenol with a substituted urea glyoxylic acid adduct of formula VI EMI3.2 Neither this reference nor the Smithkline patent suggests any formation of hydantoins. It is, therefore, surprising that the process of the present invention, using the same three reagents as the Smithkline patent but in aqueous media and in the presence of acid, produces the hydantoin of formula I . Suitable acid catalysts for this process include sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, of which we have found hydrochloric acid to be the most suitable. The reaction is preferably carried out in water but water miscible polar organic solvents, such as acetic acid, may be added to the reaction medium. The reaction should be carried out at a temperature in excess of 250C and up to 1000C. A suitable temperature range for this reaction is from 30 50 C and a particularly convenient temperature is from 350 450C. The time for which the reaction is allowed to proceed is dependent on the quantity of catalyst used and the temperature at which the reaction is performed.About 20 hours is convenient. It is possible to carry out the process of this invention in two stages, for example, by reacting urea with glyoxylic acid first and then adding phenol. It is preferable that the phenol is in excess in the reaction, a suitable ratio being approximately 2 moles of phenol to 1 mole of glyoxylic acid. The urea should also be present in a proportion from 1 to 1.5 mole per 1 mole of glyoxyle acid. Normally, the hydantoin of formula I is precipitated during the reaction and can be filtered off. After filtration, the hydantoin may be washed or reslurried with water to remove excess phenol. In the product, when the reaction is carried out using hydrochloric acid as catalyst, there are no detectable quantities of the N carbamylhydroxyphenylglycine of formula IV above. The hydantoin of formula I may be hydrolysed to produce E hydroxyphenylglycine. Qne method comprises selective enzymatic hydrolysis to produce D N carbamyl p hydroxyphenyl glycine and subsequent hydrolysis to D p hydroxyphenyl glycine, for example, as described in British PatentNo. 1,506,067. Alternatively, the hydantoin I may be hydrolysed to prepare DL p hydroxyphenylglycine, which may be resolved by known methods to yield the D amino acid. One such resolution method is disclosed in British Patent No. 1,318,216 and involves the use of O,N diacetyl p hydroxyphenylglycine. The hydrolysis of the hydantoin I may be carried out in the presence of acid or alkali. An alkaline hydrolysis is preferred. Suitable bases for the hydrolysis reaction include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxide. Preferably the hydrolysis is carried out in water. The temperature at which the hydrolysis reaction is carried out should be at about the reflux temperature of the reaction medium. p Hydroxyphenylglycine prepared in this way may be isolated directly from the reaction medium by known methods and acetylated if required. Alternatively, it. may be con xeed in situ into O,N diacetyl p hydroxyphenylglycine. Excess of base in the reaction medium is first neutralised and an acetylating agent is then added.. Suitable acetylating agents include acetic anhydride and acetyl chloride. The following examples illustrate the process of this invention.
