# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
An integrated circuit shift register comprising regions 11,13,15 and 17 of n type semiconductor material formed by diffusion in a p type epitaxy 3 formed on a substrate 5 . Overlying each region 11,13,15 and 17 is a shallow diffusion of p type material 19,21,23 and 25 , each provided with a projection 27,29,31 and 33 overlying the epitaxy material 3 between the regions 11,13,15 and 17 of n type semiconduc tor material. The regions of n type semiconductor material 11,13,15 and 17 each form common emitter and collector regions of adjacent bipolar lateral transistors in a series, the projections 27,29,31 and 33 form base contacts and the region of overlap between the shallow diffusions of p type material 19,21,23 and 25 and the regions of n type material 11,13,15 and 17 form a capacitor in the form of a reversed biased PN junction. A clocking pulse applied sequentially to the shallow diffusions of p type material causes movement through the shift register of data stored as voltages in the reverse biased PN junction. The clocking pulse sets up a potential gradient in the epitaxy 3 which restricts unwanted carrier injection into the substrate.
