# SUSPENSION SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
The invention relates to suspension systems for vehicles and is particularly concerned with such systems for vehicles having three or more axles below the load carrying area. With vehicles with two axles it is known to link the axles by a beam and to provide a single suspension means between the beam and the vehicle and whereby the weight of the system is reduced. With three or more axles it is not only necessary to link adjacent axles by beams but also necessary to interconnect the beams and hitherto this has involved the use of intricate multiple linkage systems which of them selves add to the weight and the complexity of the system. The object of the invention is to extend the principle of a linked axle system to a lorry or trailer unit provided with three or more axles which objective is met by a system comprising three or more axles on which the road wheels are rotatably mounted, and beam like members interconnecting corresponding ends of adjacent axles, with a resilient suspension means interposed between each beam and the underside of the load bearing area of the lorry or trailer unit, said beam like members supporting and being pivotally secured to a respective axle by a link engaging a resilient bush at the respective end of a beam, and at least in respect of an inner axle adjacent ends of the two opposed beam like members being connected to that axle by links that are fixed in relation to each other, which links again engage resilient bushes at the ends of the beams.
