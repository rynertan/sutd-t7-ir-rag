# Planar magnetron sputtering with modified field configuration.

## Abstract
Planar magnetron sputtering sputters a target formed of plural target members 801, 802 from their principal surface 611, 612, 613 . The plural target members are arranged on an electrode 103 . The sputtering is carried out in such a condi tion that an electric field and magnetic field are substantially parallel in their direction as the boundary regions among the plural target members.
