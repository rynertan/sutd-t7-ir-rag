# Improving the life of a catalyst used to process hydrocarbon containing feed streams.

## Abstract
In a hydrofining process, the life of a catalyst composi tion comprising a support selected from the group compris ing alumina, silica and silica alumina and a promoter comprising at least one metal selected from Group VIB, Group VIIB, and Group VIII of the periodic table is improved by mixing a decomposable compound of molybdenum with the hydrocarbon containing feed stream prior to contacting the hydrocarbon containing feed stream with the catalyst composition. The molybdenum in the decomposable com pound is in valence state of zero. A sufficient quantity of the decomposable compound of molybdenum is added to the hydrocarbon containing feed stream to result in a concentra tion of molybdenum in the range of about 1 to about 60 ppm. The introduction of the decomposable compound of molyb denum may be commenced when the catalyst is new, partially deactivated or spent with a beneficial result occur ring in each case.
