# Pile unloading and sorting device for pileable moulded articles.

## Abstract
A pile unloading device for moulded articles such as bricks, with pickers 7 11 for each time grasping a layer of articles from the pile and depositing them onto a surface of e.g. a conveyor 13 17 . Sets 7 11 of pickers side by side move simultaneously, but are operable selectively indi vidually or in groups to pick up articles from a depositing surface 13 17 selectively. The articles not thus picked up are conveyed away, may be transferred to a faster conveyor 23 to create distances between the articles and may be rotated at 24 in groups about a vertical axis. It is thus possible to grade or sort the articles according to quality, e.g. apparent from colour differences.
