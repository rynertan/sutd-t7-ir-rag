# Monoclonal antibody specific for a mammary tumor cytoplasmic antigen.

## Abstract
A monoclonal antibody is produced which is specific for an antigen found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm of human mammary tumor cells. Animals are inoculated with human mammary tumor cells or cell material, and spleen cells obtained from the animals are fused with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. The hybridomas are cultured as monoclones, and antibodies obtained from the individual clones are tested for their reactivity with cytoplasms of several human mammary tumor cell lines and mammary tumor tissues. A clone which produces an antibody that reacts with the cytoplasm of most human mammary tumor cells is selected for further culturing to produce the antibody, and the antibody is obtained from the culture growth medium or from ascitic fluid of an animal bearing a tumor of the hybridoma. The antibody is useful in diagnosing mammary tumors.
