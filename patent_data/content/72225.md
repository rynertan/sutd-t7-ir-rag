# Method of freezing fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of freezing fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like which has the steps of containing fertilized ova, sper matozoa or the like in a buffer solution at an irregular position in a tube, and cooling the same so that a buffer solution contained in an area containing no fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like becomes lower at temperature than the buffer solution containing the fertilized ova, sper matozoa or the like with desired refrigerant to freeze the second buffer solution to produce crystalline nuclei, and then cooling the nuclei so that the nuclei grow to the first buffer solution. And, an apparatus for freezing fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like which can carry out the above method. Thus, the survival rate of the fertilized ova, sper matozoa or the like can be raised, and the fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like can be readily frozen under an automatic control by simple cooling means.
