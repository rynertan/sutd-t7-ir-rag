# Method of determining calcium in a fluid sample.

## Abstract
A method of determining calcium in a fluid sample. The sample is mixed with a dye reagent of pH value at which that reagent does not produce a predetermined change when complexed with calcium ions a first colorimetric measure ment is made on the mixture of the sample and dye reagent a second reagent is added to the mixture of the sample and dye reagent to shift the pH and activate the dye reagent producing the predetermined change and then a second colorimetric measurement is made on the resulting mixture, the difference between the two colorimetric measurements being a measure or calcium in the sample.
