## Description
The present invention relates to a femoral stem in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. A femoral stem of this kind is known from US A 4 221 623. Specifically this reference discloses a method of forming an endoprosthesis comprising a longitudinally extending stem portion tapering to an end for insertion into a bone, and a head portion for carrying a ball of a ball and socket joint, said head portion being inclined to said stem portion, said method comprising the steps of The reference thus concerns a femoral stem made in a composite material. Metallic orthopedic devices, though extensively used, exhibit problems that are inherent due to the high modulus of the metals used in the devices. A majority of the total joint replacement orthopedic devices implanted to date are of the type comprised of a metallic surface bearing on an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene cup surface. For hip replacement, for instance, there is a metallic femoral component consisting of a highly polished spherical head attached to a narrow neck which then widens to a tapered shaft design to conform to the contours and to be inserted into the medullary canal. The metal of the shaft is usually a cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy or a titanium alloy with mechanical properties and load bearing ability far in excess of that of the bone itself. In a majority of cases, the shaft is attached to the bone by bone cement e.g., poly methyl methacrylate which has been packed into the cavity after oversize reaming. The implant shaft is then forced into the curing bone cement and attachment is primarily due to mechanical interlocking. Failure of hip devices have occurred in many patients. Multiple fractures in the bone cement can lead to the loosening of the implant and the eventual fatigue fracture of the shaft or stem of such a device One reason for failure of the devices is that resorption of the bone surrounding the proximal portion of the implant stem can lead to cement failure, resulting in the loosening of the stem in the bone. A loose stem cannot function properly and can cause the implant to fail even if the stem itself has not fractured. It is expected that a lower modulus stem will lead to a greater transfer of stresses to the bone in the calcar region and prevent or lessen the degree of resorption of the bone in this region. Based upon this concept, titanium alloy hips have been introduced by several orthopedic manufacturers since it has approximately half of the elastic modulus of cobalt based alloys. It has been found that reducing stem modulus increases the transfer of load from the stem to the bone. This lack of stress shielding effect will lead to a reduction in bone resorption. Bio compatible composite materials have been determined to offer the unique advantage of being light weight in construction and high in strength at low modulus values. By far, the most popular composite material for orthopedic implants is one in which reinforcing is due to carbon fibers. A hip prosthesis has been made in the past in which the stem is formed of carbon fiber reinforced carbon and a spherical head is made of aluminum oxide. Other attempts have been made to investigate the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced materials specifically for prothesis of different types. Various polymers in combination with carbon or glass fibers were considered in the studies. For instance, it has been shown that quartz and graphite fiber reinforced epoxy composite with strength in the vicinity of 1400 Mpa could be made and proven to be acceptable for implant service. Musikant, Quartz and Graphite Filament Reinforced Polymer Composites for Orthopedic Surgical Applications, In another publication, namely Litchman Still another publication mentions the use of a carbon fiber polysulfone composite for making surgical implants but does not specify how the composite is made. This publication is by M. S. Hunt, entitled, ME1689 An Introduction to the Use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composite Materials for Surgical Implants National Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Counsel for Scientific and Industrial Research, January 1981, Series No. MEI 8, Reference No. MEI 4054 Pretoria . The orthopedic device of the present invention is formed from a composite material comprised of continuous filament carbon fibers embedded within a polymer matrix. The carbon fibers in the composite material are at specific orientations relative to a specific dimension of the orthopedic device. Maximum tension and compression strength is achieved when the orientation of the fibers extend longitudinally of the orthopedic device, such as the stem of a hip prothesis. However, torsional and shear strength of the device suffers when the fibers extend parallel to the longitudinal axis. In the case of a hip prosthesis which has an upper part which projects upwardly and outwardly from the stem of the prosthesis, the strength of the upper projecting part must also be considered and, for this reason, some of the carbon fibers are made to extend longitudinally of the stem and other carbon fibers at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the stem. The angularity of the angled carbon fibers is made on a basis of the design of the prothesis itself. By changing the angularity of the carbon fibers at various levels in the composite, optimum strength in all critical load directions in light of the function of the orthopedic device can be provided. By using the materials of the present invention, one can engineer a structure to meet a particular need. Thus, modulus of elasticity can be varied within ranges to more closely approximate that of the bone in the region where the implant is to function. In addition, based on the type of loading, modulus can be varied along the longitudinal axis of the device as well as torsional strength. These fiber resin composite materials provide an advantage over metals which by necessity are homogeneous in nature and cannot provide this engineering flexibility. Thus, with metal implants, variation of tensile strength and modulus for a given metal is not possible. The modulus of bone is generally about 3 msi. The modulus of currently available titanium implants is approximately 16 msi. Stainless steel and cobalt chrome, also commonly available, have moduli of 32 msi or more. As previously stated, by reducing stem modulus and transferring the load from the stem to the bone, this leads to a reduction in bone resorption. The closer the modulus of the implant to that of bone, the less the stress shielding. with the implants of the present invention, by proper design, moduli of between 9 msi and 10 msi are easily obtained, while maintaining sufficient tensile strength to permit the use of the composite as a supporting structure. At the same time as modulus is being reduced, tensile strength of the device is to be optimized. This may be most easily accomplished by adjusting the content of the fiber volume relative to that of the bio compatible thermoplastic polymer. A minimum of about 30 polymer is required in order to form the matrix. With the device, starting with a maximum of approximately 70 fiber, 30 resin, one can reduce fiber content and increase polymer content to decrease modulus. However, there is an attendent reduction in tensile strength. Thus, while one could continue to reduce the fiber content, a point would be reached where tensile strength could be reduced to the point the device would no longer be functional. We have found that further modulus reductions can be obtained while at the same time maximizing tensile strength by varying the angle of the fibers within the composite. Thus, instead of adding polymer to reduce modulus with the attended undesirable decrease in tensile strength, we are able to achieve an implant of suitable properties by varying fiber orientation. We have found generally that the fiber content should not exceed 70 , and preferably is between 40 and 60 . The precise ratio of polymer to fiber and orientation of fibers within the various layers will be a function of design device. By laboratory testing, the strength and modulus of elasticity of a carbon fiber reinforced polysulfone composite is demonstrated to change substantially when the fiber orientation is at different angles to the load angles of the test. Table 1 illustrates this point. The mechanical properties of the composite can also be modified by varying the ratio of polymer to carbon fiber within the composite material. The uniaxial tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of carbon fiber alone is 450 ksi and 33 msi, respectively. Polysulfone, a representative engineering thermoplastic, has a tensile strength of approximately 10 ksi and a modulus of elasticity of 360 ksi. When these materials are combined into a composite, a wide variation in mechanical properties can be achieved at different fiber to polymer ratios. Table 2 presents mechanical properties measured for composites which range from 50 to 60 by weight of carbon fiber. It can be seen from the above data that, when designing a composite material structure for a particular orthopedic device design, the properties of this composite can be optimized to the requirements of the particular device design by varying fiber orientation and fiber to polymer ratio. The object of the present invention involves a composite of carbon fiber reinforced engineering thermoplastic polymer. Polysulfone has been studied as a candidate engineering thermoplastic matrix polymer and many of the mechanical properties presented above are for this carbon fiber polysulfone composite. Polysulfone has been used extensively as a medical device material and its biocompatibility and toxicity properties have been well characterized. As such, it is an excellent polymer for combination with carbon fiber as presented by this disclosure. Engineering thermoplastics include many polymers and a number of them in addition to polysulfone have been investigated as part of this invention. Engineering thermoplastics can be defined as a class of thermoplastic resins which exhibit high ultimate tensile strength, rigidity, creep resistance, and toughness, and include, but are not limited to, the following polymers polysulfone polyethersulfone polyarylsulfone polyphenylene sulfide polycarbonates aromatic polyamides aromatic polyamideimides thermoplastic polyimides, and the polyaryletherketone polyetheretherketones polyarylethernitriles aromatic polyhydroxyethers and the like. Typical mechanical properties for an engineering thermoplastic are an ultimate tensile strength of 10,000 psi, an elastic modulus of 250,000 500,000, psi, and an elongation to break of from 10 to 100 . Composites of carbon fibers and several of these polymers have been made, including polyether sulfones of three different molecular weights ICI 200 p, ICI 300 p, and ICI 720 p , polyaryl sulfone 3M Company Astrell , polyimide DuPont NR150 A and polyimide amide Amoco Torlon 4000 . Typical mechanical properties of these polymers are presented in Table 3. The mechanical properties of these composite materials are comparable to structural metal alloys that are presently used to manufacture orthopedic devices. The maximum values for composite properties are measured along the axis of the fiber orientation. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity values for a unidirectional carbon fiber polysulfone composite are presented in comparison to common orthopedic alloys in Table 4. The building material for the devices of this invention are uniplanar sheets of continuous filament carbon fiber tows encapsulated in the engineering thermoplastic polymer matrix, the fibers being arranged in parallel within the uniplanar sheet and are continuous within the sheet. The fiber tows are comprised of bundles of filaments, commercially available tows having approximately 5,000 15,000 filaments bundle. There is no preferred filament diameter. However, for reasons of availability and manufacturing suitability, it is preferable to use such materials as those provided by Hercules under the designation Hercules AS4, containing approximately 12,000 fiber filaments tow, each filament having a diameter of approximately 7 9 microns. The uniplanar sheets are formed using continuous filament fiber. To effect fiber orientation, these uniplanar sheets are first formed and then cut into coupons and stacked to form blocks. The manner in which the sheets or coupons are oriented will effect final modulus and tensile properties. By way of example, in one embodiment for making the orthopedic device of the present invention, in a series of steps in which the composite block is formed, a block is formed from a multiplicity of stacked coupons comprised of a plurality of carbon fibers and a polymer, such as polysulfone. The block is typically rectangular in shape and of a predetermined thickness, such as 0.5 inch. to 1.25 inches. The block is machined to the desired shape of the orthopedic device and, after smoothing its outer surfaces, the device is ready for use as an implant. In the case of a hip prosthesis, the stem and head of the prosthesis can be integral with each other and formed simultaneously from the composite block. In the alternative, the stem can be formed from the block and a head of metal can then be attached to one end of the stem to form the prosthesis. The composite block used to form the prosthesis has polymer in the range of 25 to 50 by weight, and preferably 30 40 , the carbon fiber content making up the remainder of the block. The primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved orthopedic device and method of making the same wherein the device is comprised of a continuous filament carbon fiber reinforced polymer. In one embodiment, it is formed by laminating a stack of carbon fiber pieces under heat and pressure to form a composite block and the block is machined to the desired shape and size of the orthopedic device, whereupon the device has optimized mechanical properties for the orthopedic device and is of medical grade quality. Other objects of this invention will become apparent as the following specification progresses, reference being had to the accompanying drawing which shows schematic views of the steps in the formation of the orthopedic device. To illustrate the first embodiment of the present invention, reference is made to Fig. 1 which shows a hip prosthesis 10 having a stem 12 provided with a lower main shaft 14 and an upper, inclined neck or extension 16. A femoral head 18 which is generally spherical in configuration is attached by a short neck 20 to extension 16. The various parts of prosthesis 10 are all integral with each other and are formed from a composite block made with carbon fibers and polysulfone in the manner hereinafter described. In carrying out the teachings of the present invention, a roll 22 Fig. 2 of carbon fiber tow 26 is mounted for rotation on any suitable support for rotation about a generally horizontal axis 24. The tow 26 is passed over a first guide 28, then into a vessel 30 containing a solution 32 of a suitable polymer, such as polysulfone in methylene chloride or other suitable solvent. Any one of the Other above mentioned polymers may be used. Polysulfone will hereinafter be referred to as the polymer. The tow is thus coated with the polysulfone and as the tow leaves the vessel 30, it is directed by guide 34 toward and about a rotating drum 38 on which the polysulfone coated tow is wrapped spirally to form side by side convolutions which engage each other. The spiral wrap of the tow on the drum is for the purpose of forming a laminate 40 of carbon fibers. After the polysulfone has dried on the drum, the resulting sheet represents the laminate 40 which can be cut into pieces of rectangular shape. Laminate 40 is comprised of adjacent, side by side, strips of carbon fibers. In this form, the laminate is cut into rectangular pieces or coupons which are shown in dashed in lines in Fig. 3. Coupons 42 are shown in which longitudinal axes of the coupons are parallel to the carbon fibers in the coupons. Coupons 44 are cut from laminate 40 and have their carbon fibers at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axes of the coupons 44. The reason for this will be set forth hereinafter. The cutting of the coupons 42 and 44 can be accomplished by a stamping process or other suitable technique. Coupons 42 and 44 are arranged in a stack 50 Fig. 4 so that they can be placed in a mold 52 Fig. 7 and, while under heat and pressure in the mold, the polysulfone in the stack will melt and flow to form a composite block 54 Fig. 8 from which the prosthesis 10 can be machined. Moreover, the carbon fiber coupons 42 will alternate with the carbon fiber coupons 44 as shown in Fig. 4. When stack 50 is formed, it will be placed in mold 52 having heating elements 58 therein. A press 60 is adapted to apply pressure in the range of 800 to 1200 psi to the stack 50 in mold 52. The temperature of the mold will be in the range of 500 to 700 F as pressure is applied by press 60 to the stack 50. Following a molding time, typically one hour or more, and after a cooling period, the block 54 will be formed in mold 52. Then, the block is taken from the mold and then machined by suitable tools to form prosthesis 10. The prosthesis is outlined in Fig. 9 in block 54 and, in this case, head 18 is formed as an integral part of stem 12. In final preparation for use, the head is typically provided with a coating to harden the surface thereof. In the alternative, only stem 12 is formed from block 54, and a metallic head is secured to the stem in any suitable manner, such as with an epoxy adhesive. The orientation of fibers in a particular implant design can be chosen to optimize mechanical properties for that design. For example, in a hip implant design in which the neck 16 of the prosthesis is at an angle of 45 to the stem 14 of the prosthesis Fig. 1 , a combination of laminates for the block could be chosen as follows 70 at 0 and 30 at 45 or 60 at 0 , 30 at 15 , and 10 at 90 fiber orientation to provide sufficient strength in the stem and neck of the design. The modulus of elasticity also changes as various fiber orientations of the laminates are used so that a modulus could be chosen for each specific design. The graphs in Figs. 10 and 11 demonstrate how mechanical properties can change as the percentage of 45 laminates used in a composite block increases, the data shown for a fiber resin ratio of 60 40. A method of achieving a final prosthesis shape is as follows A test series was conducted to evaluate the difference in response of living bone to the implantation of hip prosthesis of identical design, but with some being fabricated from a standard orthopedic metal, cast Co Cr Mo alloy, and some being fabricated from a lower modulus carbon fiber reinforced polysulfone composite. Canines were used as the test model. The composite prosthesis was fabricated by the method first described in the above test. Two dimensional plys of carbon fiber polysulfone composite sheets were stacked into a block mold with alternate plys containing fibers oriented at 15 and 15 to the axis of the block. After blocks of this type were molded, finished canine hip implants were machined from the blocks. The flexural bending strength and flexural modulus of elasticity of this 15 composite, determined by three point bending tests were 90 ksi and 9 msi, respectively. Comparative tensile strength and modulus values of the cast Co Cr Mo alloy are reported to be 80 ksi and 32 msi, respectively. At one implant per animal, several composite and Co Cr Mo devices were implanted and will be retrieved from the animals at incremental periods of up to 2 years. In addition to functional performance, at sacrifice, the implant and surrounding tissue is to be examined histologically, and periodic radiological examination x ray is performed. At 6 weeks after implantation, differences in the bone tissue adjacent to the implants were seen. Dramatic new bone growth could be seen macro and microhistologically in the calcar region and the region of the femur adjacent to the tip of the implant stem of the animals with composite implants. This bone growth was also demonstrated radiographically at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post implantation. Alternatively, at 6 weeks post implantation of the Co Cr Mo implant, regions of bone resorption were seen histologically in the calcar region and the region of the femur adjacent to the tip of the implant stem. Radiologically, a radiolucent zone could be detected in areas around to Co Cr Mo implants as early as 12 weeks post implantation, suggesting the initiation of implant microloosening.
