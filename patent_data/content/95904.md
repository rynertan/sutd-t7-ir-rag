## Description
DETERGENT LIQUORS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR USE THEREIN F E Hardy J Bell M C Addison This invention relates to laundry wash liquors and detergent compositions for use therein, capable of removing oxidisable stains from fabrics washed therein at temperatures at or below 600C. More particularly the invention relates to wash liquors containing mixtures of inorganic peroxygen bleaches of the perhydrate type and certain acetylated sugars and their derivatives serving as organic peroxy bleach precursors, which mixtures can be made to deliver improved bleaching performance under defined conditions. The use of organic peroxy bleach precursors together with ro oxygen bleaches of the perhydrate type ti.e alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, persilicates, perpyrophosphates and the like for removing oxidisable stains at low temperatures i.e. C 600C is well known in the detergent art. Furthermore the use of acetylated polyols, including acetylated mono and di saccharides as peroxy bleach precursors is also disclosed in the prior art, notably inBritish Patent No. 836 988 where fructose penta acetate, glucose penta acetate, glucose tetra acetate and sucrose octa acetate are taught for this purpose. British Patent 836 988 discloses that the release of one mole of peracetic acid would be expected from glucose tetra acetate and two moles would be expected from glucose penta acetate. No predictions are given for other disclosed polyol esters but it is assumed that they would behave similarly and release one or two moles of peracetic acid under the conditions employed in British Patent 836 988.Surprisingly it has now been found that under certain defined conditions of usage this limitation does not apply and that in consequence more efficielb u tilisation of this class of organic peroxy bleach precursor is possible. By more efficient utilisation is meant that more peroxy acid bleach can be obtained from the same weight of precursor or alternatively the same amount of peroxy acid can be obtained from a lesser amount of precursor, resulting in a corresponding improvement in cost effectiveness. This finding is of particular importance insofar as the saccharide esters are derived from materials available in bulk which are not petroleum based, and which therefore constitute a potentially high volume source of organic peroxy acid bleaching agent, which is less subject to the cost inflation associated with chemicals derived wholly from petroleum sources. According to the present invention there is provided a laundry wash liquor adapted for the removal of oxidisable stains, particularly at temperatures of less than 600C, said liquor containing 0.18 to 2.0 by weight of a detergent composition comprising an organic surfactant, an inorganic peroxygen bleach of the perhydrate type, and a peracetic acid precursor comprising an acetylated aldohexopyranose or aldohexopyranoside containing acetyl groups on at least three adjacent carbon atoms, said wash liquor having a starting pH of at least 9.5, wherein the inorganic peroxygen bleach is present in an amount of at least 8.5 millimoles dm3 and in that the molar ratio of the perhydrate to the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside is ,12 l whereby the conversion efficiency of the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside to peracetic acid is 50 . Preferably the precursor is a fully acetylated aldohexopyranose or aldohexopyranoside. Preferably also the molar ratio of perhydrate to sugar alcohol is7 15 1 and the starting pH of the wash liquor is at least 10.0. A highly preferred acetylated aldohexopyranose is penta acetyl glucose in either alpha or beta form, or mixtures thereof , and preferred aldohexopyranosides include octa acetyl lactose and octa acetyl sucrose. The present invention in its broadest aspect requires the formation of a laundry wash liquor incorporating an organic surfactant, an inorganic peroxygen bleach of the perhydrate type and an acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside containing acetyl groups on at least three adjacent carbon atoms, the liquor pH being at least 9.5.

An example of a suitable anionic nonionic surfactant mixture is disclosed in European Patent Application No.81301983.3 Publication No. 0040038 . Exemplary anionic nonionic cationic mixtures are disclosed in EuropeanPatent Application No. 78200050.2 Publication No. 0000225 .In the mixtures of Application No. 78200050.2, the surfactant system contains anionic and cat ionic surfactants in an equivalent ratio of at least 1 1, the weight ratio of anionic cationic surfactants is A 5 1 and the weight ratio of nonionic to cationic surfactants is in the range from 100 1 to 2 3. Combinations of anionic, ethoxylated nonionic, semipolar amine oxide and cationic surfactants are disclosed in European Patent Application No. 83200064.0 filed 14thJanuary, 1983. The laundry liquors of the present invention contain from 10 5000 parts per million, more preferably from 100 to 1500 parts per million of surfactant. In the detergent composition aspect of the invention, the level of surfactant in the composition lies in the range from 5 to 15 by weight, such compositions being employed at levels of from o.lE to 2.0 by weight of the liquor. The second component of the laundry liquor is an inorganic peroxygen bleach of the perhydrate type which ispresent at a level of at least 8.5 millimoles dm3 corresponding to 1300 ppm sodium perborate tetrahydrate. The wash liquor can contain up to 7000 ppm of perhydrate product expressed on the foregoing basis, but formulation and cost con .traints normally limit the maximum level to a value less than this. If the perhydrate is added as part of a detergent composition of the type commercially available in Europe, or 9 part of an additive product intended for use under sonentional European wash conditions, the level generally lie in the range from 1300 ppm to 3200 ppm, more usually in the range from 1500 ppm to 2000 ppm.However, if the perhydrate is added as part of a composition intended to be used in a concentrated washing process such as that disclosed in european Patent Application No. 82305942.3, PublicationNot 0079234, the level of perhydrate expressed as sodium perborate tetrahydrate may be in the range 3000 6000 ppm. wor the purposes of ths invention perhydrate type bleaches are defined as those having hydrogen peroxide associated with the molecule such as alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, ersilicates and perpyrophosphates. In the detergent composition of this invention the inorganic peroxygen bleach will normally be present at a level of from 15 to 35 by weight, preferably from 15 to 25 by weight of the composition. Preferred perhydrates are sodium perborate mono and tetrahydrate and sodium percarbonate. The ester type peroxy bleach precursors of the present invention can be broadly defined as acetylated aldohexopyranoses or aldohexopyranosides containing at lea three acetyl groups on adjacent carbon atoms. Preferably the aldohexopyranoses or aldopyranosides are fully acetylated. Suitable acetylated aldohexopyranoses include penta acetyl glucose, penta acetyl lactose and penta acetyl mannose. Examples of aldohexopyranosides include galactopyranoside derivatives such as octa acetyl lactose and glucopyranosides such as octa acetyl sucrose and tetra acetyl alpha C1 C12 alkyl glucosides such as alpha methyl, alpha butyl and alpha lauryl glucoside. In general, all of the available hydroxyl groups are acetylated as this is convenient from a manufacturing standpoint and facilitates the most efficient use of the molecule, but the invention does not preclude the use of less than fully acetylated molecules. As noted previously, this general class of materials is known as a source of acetyl groups for the production of peracetic acid when mixed with inorganic perhydrate salts.However, the literature appears to have considered peracetic acid formation from acetylated sugar perhydrate salt mixtures largely, if not exclusively, in terms of the reactivities of individual acetate groups. In the case of acetylated aldohexopyranoses this can give rise to misleading predictions, as the reactivity of an acetate group is less important than its selectivity i.e. its ability to perhydrolyse rather than hydrolyse. Depending on the acidity of the alcohol group from which the acetate is derived, the ratio between hydrolysis and perhydrolysis can range from 104 1 to 1 3x102. The Applicants have found that certain acetylated aldohexopyranoses can be utilised more effectively, i.e. can be induced to provide more peracetic acid per mole than hitherto considered possible, if the molecules satisfy certain structural criteria which enhance the acidity of the substituent acetyl groups. R.L. Wells, Linear Free Energy Relationships , Academic Press 1968 , pages 35 39 suggests the use of Taft substituent parameters or as a means of gauging the acidifying effects of neighbouring polar groups on substituents attached to a carbonyl group. The followingTable. lists a number of substituents and their Taft values w . Substituent Taft value,6r CH3 0.00 CH2OAc 0.89 CH2CH2OAc 0.36 CH2OMe 0.66 CH2CH2OMe 0.26 CH2OH 0.55 CH2CXH2OH 0.22EMI13.1 0.62 0.26 The Applicants have found that, surprisingly, the above effects also hold true for substituents attached to a hydroxyl group in aldohexopyranoses and pyranosides. If the assumptions are made that the effect diminishes by 40 for each intervening carbon tom and that the effect of groups more than two carbon atoms distant can be ignored, estimations can be made of the potential number of acetyl groups that could be released from different acetylated aldohexopyranoses and pyranosides.On this basis, summation of the effects of the different influencing groups on a particular acetyl, to provide a 2o for that acetyl, leads to the followinq correlation.EMI13.2 perhydrolysis favoured relative to hydrolysis.EMI13.3 perhydrolysis and hydrolysis equally favoured.EMI13.4 hydrolysis favoured. For the purposes of this correlation it is assumed that both OOH and OH concentration are not limiting with respect to the precursor concentration. An example of a preferred acetylated aldohexopyranose to which this correlation applies is penta acetyl glucose.British Patent No. 836 988 identifies a mole of this material as being capable of producing two moles of peracetic acid ana provides an illustraiv detergent composition in 9 hiCh it 5 used at an unspecified alkaline pH and a molar ratio of sodium perborate to glucose ester of 2 1. Application of the above described estimation technique to this acetylated polyol, whose structure is shown schematically below, provides a value for Cr for each acetyl group as followsEMI14.1 Acetyl Position 1 2 3 4 6 1.02 0.98 0.72 0.62 0.26 If allowance is made for the change in Cp values as each acetyl group is released from the molecule, then the estimated no. of peracetic acid molecules mole of penta acetyl glucose is 3.5. In an experiment run to check this hypothesis the no. found at pH 11.5 and perhydrate penta acetyl glucose molar ratio of 15 1, was 3.4. The conversion of acetyl groups to peracetic acid can be expressed as a conversion efficiency i.e. as a percentage of the acetyl groups present in the molecule. Thus the prior art suggests an efficiency of 2 5 40 for penta acetyl glucose whilst the conditions provided by a detergent liquor in accordance with the invention enable a conversion efficiency of 3.4 67 for this material to be achieved. 5Conversion efficiencies, both estimated and achieved, for other preferred materials are shown in the table below.

Preferred materials have estimated conversion efficiencies in excess of 50 , and more preferably in excess of 60 . Most preferred materials are penta acetyl glucose and octa acetyl lactose. Levels of incorporation of the acetylated aldohexopyranoses in the detergent liquors of the invention lie in the range 10 1000 ppm, preferably from 150 500 ppm.In the detergent composition aspect of the invention the level of acetylated aldohexopyranoses in the composition can lie in the range from 1 to 5 by weight of the product, more preferably from 2 to 4 . The invention also requires that the wash liquor have a starting pH of at least 9.5. Preferably the starting or nitial wash liquor pH is at least 10.0 and most preferably at least 10.2. As noted hereinbefore the wash liquor product voncentration can lie within the range 0.1 1.0 by weight but for the purposes of determining the starting wash liquor pH, measurement is made of a 0.5 wt solution at 200C and references to the wash liquor pH shall be construed accordingly. The starting or initial wash liquor pH is defined as the pH of the detergent liquor measured after all of the soluble components have dissolved and before any soiled fabrics have been added. Achievement of a wash liquor pH above the minimum recited value is preferably secured by control of the component levels during manufacture of the detergent composition but can be achieved by direct addition of alkaline ingredients such as alkalis or alkali metal silicates, carbonates or phosphates to the wash liquor following dissolution of the detergent composition. However, the latter practice, although feasible for practice of the invention in commercial laundering operations, is not preferred for domestic laundering. The detergent liquors of the invention and compositions for their production can contain any of the optional ingredients customarily used in fabric washing processes. As these ingredients are not essential to the practice of the invention, their usage therein is described for convenience with reference to their level in the detergent composition aspect of the invention. A principal optional component of the invention particularly in its granular form is at least one detergent organic or inorganic builder salt which can be any one of the water soluble or water insoluble salts conventionally used for this purpose. Suitable inorganic builder salts include orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, tripolyphosphates and the higher polymeric glassy phosphates, silicates, carbonates, and the water insoluble crystalline aluminosilicates such as hydrated Zeolite A, X or P.Organic builder salts include the aminocarboxylates such as the salts of nitrilotriacetic acid NTA , ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid EDTA and diethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid DETPA and the methylene phosphonate analogues of these materials NTMP, EDTMP andDETPMP, as well as the salts of polycarboxylic acids such as lactic acid, glycollic acid and ether derivatives thereof as disclosed in Belgian Patents 821,368, 821,369 and 821,370 succinic acid, malonic acid, ethylenedioxy diacetic acid, maleic acid, diglycollic acid, tartaric acid, tartronic acid and fumaric acid citric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, lactoxysuccinic acid, and 2 oxy 1,1,3 propane tri carboxylic acid oxydisuccinic acid, 1,1,2,2 ethane tetracarboxylic acid, 1,1,3,3 propane tetracarboxylic acid and 1,1,2,3 propane tetracarboxylic acid cyclo pentane cis, cis, cis tetracarboxylic acid cyclopentadienide pentacarboxylic acid, 2,3,4,5 tetrahydrofuran cis, cis, cis tetracarboxylic acid, 2,5 tetrahydrofuran cis dicarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexane hexacarboxylic acid, mellitic acid, pyromellitic acid and the phthalic acid derivatives disclosed in British Patent 1,425,343. The builder salts preferably comprise from 5 to 70 by weight of the composition, preferably from 102 to 50 by weight for granular detergents, and may comprise mixtures of any of the above mentioned. The compositions of the present invention can be supplemented by all manner of detergent components. Soil suspending agents at 0.1 to 10 by weight e.g. methyl cellulose and its derivatives such as water soluble salts of carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyhydroxymethyl cellulose and nolyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of 400 to 10,00e are common components of the present invention. Anti caking agents, such as sodium sulphosuccinate or sodium ben oate, dyes, pigments, optical bleaches such as tri and tetra sulphonated zinc phthalo cyanine, and perfumes can be included in varying amounts as desired. Enzymes in minor amounts are conventional ingredients of the compositions, those suitable for use including the materials discussed in U.S. patents 3,519,570 and 3,533,139 to McCarty and McCarty et al.

An alkali metal, or alkaline earth metal, silicate can also be present. The alkali metal silicate preferably is used in an amount from 0.58 to 10 preferably from 3i to 8 .Suitable silicate solids have a molar ratio of Si02 alkali metal20 in the range from 0.5 to 4.0, but much more preferably from 1.0 to 1.8, especially about 1.6.

U.S. Patent 3,933,672 issued January 20 1976, toBartollota et al. discloses silicone suds controlling agents suitable herein. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as siloxane having the formula EMI19.1 wherein x is from 20 to 2,000 and R and R are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, methyl, propyl, butyl and phenol. The polydimethylsiloxanes R and R are methyl having a molecular weight within the range of from 200 to 2,000,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents.Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl or aryl hydrocarbyl groups exhibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of the like ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methyl , ethyl , phenyl , methylpolysiloxanes and the like. Additional useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surface of the solid silica. A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanated silica having a particle size in the range from 10 millimicrons to 20 millimicrons and a specific surface area above 50 m2 g.intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from 500 to 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of from 1 1 to 1 10.The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or water dispersible, substantially non surface active detergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds suppressors are the self emulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described inGerman Patent Application DTOS 2,646,126 published April 28, 1977. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commercially available from Dow Corning, which is a siloxane glycol copolymer. Where not included as a component of the builder system, a highly preferred ingredient of the detergent liquors and of compositions for their production, is a polyphosphonic acid or salt thereof in an amount from 0.01 to 4 , especially from 0.1 to 1.0 by weight. At this level of incorporation, which is below the range of levels normally employed for deterge builders, the polyphosphonic acid or salt thereof is folnd e provide bleachable stain detergency benefits. Especially preferred polyphosphdnates have the formula EMI20.1 wherein each R is CH2PO3H2 or a water soluble salt thereof and n is from 0 to 2. Examples of compounds within this class are aminotri methylenephosphonic acid , ethylene diamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid and diethylene triamine penta methylene phosphonic acid . Of these, ethylenediamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid is particularly preferred. The detergent composition preferably contains a copolymeric carboxylic acid or salt thereof in an amount of from 0.18 to 5 by weight of the composition as a soil antiredeposition agent. The copolymeric polycarboxylic acid, which comprises at least two carboxyl radicals separated from each other by not more than two carbon atoms and which has an average molecular weight in the range from 500 to 2,000,000 more preferably from 12,000 to 1,500,000 comprises a polycarboxylic acid units having the general formula EMI20.2 wherein X, Y, and Z are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, aryl, alkaryl, carboxyl, hydroxy and carbpxymethyl at least one of X, Y, and Z being selected from the group consisting of carboxyl and carboxymethyl, provided that X and Y can be carboxymethyl only when Z is selected from carboxyl and carboxymethyl and wherein only one of X, Y, and Z can be methyl, aryl, hydroxyl and alkaryl, and b monomer units selected fromEMI21.1 wherein R1 is a C1 to C12 alkyl group or a C1 to C12 acyl group, R1 optionally being hydroxy substituted,EMI21.2 wherein R2 is H or CH3 and R3 is H, or a C1 to C10 alkyl group, R2, R3 optionally being hydroxy substituted,EMI21.3 wherein each of R4 to R7 is H or an alkyl groups such thatR4 to R7 together have from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R4 R7 each optionally being hydroxy substituted, andEMI21.4 in which R8 is benzyl or pyrrolidone. Highly preferred examples of such carboxylates are 1 1 styrene maleic acid copolymer, di isobutylene maleic acid copolymers, methyl vinyl ether maleic acid copolymers and maleic acid acrylic acid copolymers having a molar ratio between 1 1 and 1 4. Other suitable polycarboxylates are poly alpha hydroxy acrylates and lactones thereof as described in Belgian Patent 817,678 and B.P. 1,425,307. Another suitable component of detergent compositions i accordance with the invention is a water soluble magnesium salt which is added at levels in the range from 0.015 to 0.2 , preferably from 0.03 to 0.15 and more preferably from 0.05 to 0.12 by weight of the compositions based on weight of magnesium . Suitable magnesium salts include magnesium sulphate, magnesium sulphate heptahydrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, magnesium fluoride and magnesium acetate. In the broadest aspect of the invention, the various components can be added independently and directly to the water to form the wash liquor, the only requirement being that the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside should not be added before the inorganic peroxy bleach. Simultaneous addition of all of the ingredients is a convenient method of operation, and a preferred mode comprises the use of a preformed detergent composition to form the detergent liquor. In this preferred mode the surfactant typically together with builder and filler salts is formed into an aqueous slurry and converted into a granule, preferably by spray drying. For a typical spray drying process, the aqueous slurry is mixed ata temperature in the range 70 900C and the water content of the slurry adjusted to a range of 25 to 45 , preferably 30 388 by weight. Spray drying is undertaken with drying gas inlet temperature of from 250 350 C, preferably 275 330 C, provzdincg a final moisture content is in the range of from 89 to 14 ry weight.Nonionic surfactant, where present, can then be sprayed in fluid form onto the spray dried detergent grar i The inorganic peroxy bleach and the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside are then dry mixed indepondently with the spray dried granules to form the detergent composition. A preferred form of the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside for incorporation into a detergent composition is as an extrudate formed by the process described in European Patent Application Publication No.0062523 filed October 23, 1981. In this process the acetylated aldohexbopyranose or pyranoside is first formed into a particulate having a particle size distribution such that at least 50 , preferably at least 80 passes a 250 micron screen. In preferred embodiments of the invention at least 50 and most preferably at least 80 of the acetylated compounds pass through a 100 micron. screen. This particulate material is then mixed with an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant melting in the range from 200C to 600C to give a homogeneous friable mass comprising from 75 to 95 , preferably from 84 to 90 of solid and from 5 to 25 , preferably from 10 to 16 of ethoxylated alcohol.This is then mechanically extruded through an extruder having a radial discharge through an apertured screen to form elongate particles having an average lateral dimension in the range from 0.5 mm to 2 mm and an average longitudinal dimension of from 1 mm to 6 mm. Suitable non ionic surfactants are primary or secondary Cg Cl8 alcohols having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 3 to 30, more preferably 5 to 14, an example being tallow alcohol condensed with an average of 11 ethylene oxide groups per mole of alcohol. In such executions, the incorporation into the extrusion mixture of a low level of an acidic material, prevents or minimises the discolouration of the extrudates when they are subsequently incorporated into, and stored in contact with, alkaline detergent compositions. This discolouration arises as a result of alkali attack on aldehyde sugars which leads to the formation of complex coloured compounds. Certain of the preferred acetylated aldohexopyranosides such as alpha methyl tetraacetyl glucose do not suffer this discolouration as they lack the hemiacetyl linkages which are prone to alkaline attack. Surprisingly, however, octaacetyl lactose which does contain such a linkage does not display discolouration when incorporated into an extrudate with a nonionic as described above and subjected to storage.Accordingly, the tetra acetyl Cl Cl2 alkyl glucosides and octa acetyl lactose are the preferred ester type peroxy bleach precursors for incorporation into particulate alkaline detergent compositions. The detergent composition aspect of the invention can case a variety of particulate forms other than spray dried granules such as agglomerates made in rotary drums, pans or fluidised beds, noodles or ribbons made by extrusion techniques, as well as compressed particulate forms such as tablets or pellets. In all of these forms the acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside can be processed with the other components provided that, as discussed above, it is not formed into intimate mixtures with those components which are alkaline in nature, or processed under hot aqueous alkaline conditions, which promote hydrolysis of the acyl groups and thus reduce the potential for peroxy acid production. Typical detergent compositions contain 5 158 of the surfactant system, 15 258 of an inorganic perhydrate such as sodium perborate or percarbonate, 1 5 of acetylated aldohexopyranose or pyranoside and 55 69 of organic or inorganic salts, miscellaneous additives and water. A preferred surfactant system is a water soluble anionic cationic nonionic mixture in which the anionic is present in an amount greater than the stoichiometric equivalent of the cationic surfactant and the ratio of anionic nonionic surfactants is 1 1 by weight. The invention also embraces the use of additive produc.2 together with conventional laundry detergents to form the detergent liquors. The additive products may be in either liquid or solid form, and if solid may be particulate or non particulate in nature. A particularly preferred non particulate additive product it disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1,586,76 and European Ap ca 78200051.7 Publication No 00226 Briefly, these disclosures relate to additive products comprising organic peroxy acid bleach precursor in water releasable combination with a non particulate flexible substrate, preferably in sheet form, in which the precursor to substrate ratio lies in the range from 1 10 to 30 1, more preferably from 1 2 to 8 1. European Application No. 78200051.7 discloses the combination of this precursor substrate system with a nonionic cationic surfactant mixture in which the ratio of nonionic to cationic lies in the range from 20 1 to 1 2, preferably from 5 1 to 3 2. The additive products of BP 1,586,769 and EuropeanApplication No. 0000226 are neutral to acidic in character so that the discolouration problems associated with the incorporation of the precursors of the invention into particulate detergent compositions do not arise. Suitable particulate additive products are disclosed inEuropean Patent Application No. 79200303.0 Publication No.0006655 and the previously mentioned European PatentApplication Publication No. 0062523, both of which relate to the use of normally solid, water soluble or water dispersible organic materials as a component of the additive product.Preferred materials are solid at temperatures below 250C and more preferably do not soften appreciably below 300C, such as ethoxylated alcohols having an alkyl chain length greater than 16 carbon atoms and containing at least eleven moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. The invention is illustrated in the following non limitative examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example 1 A laundry liquor was made up by adding the following ingredients simultaneously to the drum of a Miele Automatic washing machine containing 12 litres water of 100 Calcium Magnesium ratio 5 1 and temperature 180C. 7.14 g Sodium C118 alkyl linear alkyl benzene sulphonate 33.5 g Sodium perborate tetrahydrate 5.7 g Penta acetyl glucose PAG 0.5 g Sodium ethylene diamine tetramehylene phosphonate Molar ratio of H202 sodium perborate to PAG 15 1 The pH was adjusted to 9.5 with 12 g citric acid and the machine was started using a 400C low agitation cycle. 25 ml samples of wash liquor were extracted at 2 minute intervals and analysed for peracetic acid using the following technique. The 25 ml samples of wash liquor were added to a solution containing 6 mls glacial acetic acid and 10 mls KI solution 10 . The solution was maintained at 0 C by the copious addition of crushed ice. The iodine produced through peracetic acid oxidation of I was then titrated with standard sodium thiosulphate 0.01M solution, until the end point was reached. After 12 minutes the maximum level of peracetic acid release was recorded corresponding to 2.5 moles of peracetic acid per mole of PAG conversion efficiency 50 . The experiment was repeated using the H202 PAG molar ratios and pH levels shown below.H202 PAG ratio pH Moles peracetic Conversion mole PAG Efficien 15 1 9.0 2.2 44 15 1 10.32 2.8 56k 15 1 11. k 3.4 68 Cl pH 9 adjustment required. 20g citric acid addition to wash liquor. pH pH 10.3 no adjustment required. pH pH 11.5 adjustment required. 10g sodium hydroxide addition to wash liquor. It can be seen that, in order to obtain a release of at least 2.5 moles of peracetic acid per mole of penta acetyl glucose, a starting pH of at least 9.5 is necessary and that, with increasing pH, the perhydrolysis of the acetyl group is increasingly favoured relative to hydrolysis.Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using 14.28 g Sodium C118 alkyl linear alkyl benzene sulphonate 67.0 g Sodium perborate tetrahydrate 5.7 g Penta acetyl glucose PAG 0.5 g Sodium ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate to give a molar ratio of H202 to PAG of 30 1 and the pH was adjusted to 11.5 with 8.5 g sodium hydroxide. 25 ml samples of wash liquor were extracted at 2 minute intervals and analysed for peracetic acid and after 8 minutes the maximum level of peracetic acid release corresponded to 3.6 moles of peracetic acid per mole of PAG conversion efficiency 72 . The experiment was repeated usingH202 PAG molar ratios and pH levels shown below.H202 PAG ratio Initial Moles peracetic Conversion pH mole PAG Efficiency Actual 30 1 9.5 3.0 60 30 1 10. D 3.3 66 Q pH 9.5 adjustment required. 22g citric acid addition to wash liquor. Q2 pH 10.3 no adjustment required. This example illustrates the benefit of increased perhydrate polyol acetate ratio on the yield of peracetic acid per mole of penta acetyl glucose.Example 3 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using 135 g of commercially available granular detergent containing 8.58 Sodium C12 alkyl benzene sulphonate 3.2 Ethoxylated alcohol surfactant 26 Sodium perborate 41 Inorganic builder salts 21.3 Miscellaneous water together with 5.7 g penta acetyl glucose incorporated in a formulation comprising 5.7 g PAG 5.0 g PEG 6000 5.0 g C1415 alcohol ethoxylate E7 2.0 g C14 alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide 0.5 g Ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid 0.3 g Maleic anhydride methyl vinyl ether copolymer MWt 250,000 acid form impregnated on a 33 cm x 22.5 cm nonwoven rayon sheet. The molar ratio of H202 to PAG was 15 1. The pH was 4 10 and the machine was started using a 400C low agitation cycle. 25 ml samples of wash liquor were extracted at 2 minute intervals and analysed for peracetic acid. After 14 minutes the maximum level of peracetic acid release was recorded corresponding to 2.8 moles of peracetic acid per mole of PAG conversion efficiency 56 .Example 4 A detergent formulation was spray dried to provide the following composition in parts by weight. Sodium Cll 8 alkyl benzene sulphonate 5.6Sodium tallow alkyl sulphate 2.4Sodium tripolyphosphate 22.0Sodium silicate SiO2 Na2O ratio 8.00 1.6 1Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 0.84Maleic anhydride methyl vinyl ether copolymer MWt 250,000 1.00Sodium EDTA 0.21Sodium EDTMP 0.30 C18 C22 fatty acid 0.50Tallow alcohol E11 0.40Anionic fluorescer 0.25Tetra sulphonated zinc phthalocyanine 0.0045Sodium sulphate 23.8Water 7.5Base powder total 72.8 parts To this base powder was added separately 21.5 parts of sodium perborate tetrahydrate, 2.6 parts of a proteolytic enzyme prill containing 0.60 parts of Alcalase RTM and 2.0 parts sodium tripolyphosphate, 0.4 parts of a suds suppressing prill comprising a mixture of mineral oil, wax and silica, 2.6 parts of a prill comprising 2.0 parts of penta acetyl glucose and 0.6 parts of TAE11 and 0.1 parts of perfume spray on. The PAG TAE11 prill was made by the process of British Patent Application No. 8111080 and comprised cylindrical particles of length 2 3 times their diameter having a particle size 0.85 mm and less than 1.6 mm. The molar ratio of perhydrate to PAG in the composition was thus 27.4 1. On dissolution to form a 0.5 solution at 250C the pH was 10.2 and after 8 minutes at 600C a release of 3.4 moles of peracetic acid per mole of PAG was obtained, an actual conversion efficiency of 64 . Storage of the detergent product containing the PAG TAEll prill under ambient conditions of temperature 150C and humidity 20 resulted in the prill developing brown surface discolouration after approximately 24 hours although this did not affect its dissolution or perhydrolyss.sW Addition of lauric acid or citric acid to the extrusion mixture in an amount corresponding to 10 by weight of the mix led to a delay in the onset of this discolouration and reduction in its severity. Replacement of the penta acetyl glucose by octa acetyl lactose or tetra acetyl alpha methyl glucoside provides satisfactory dissolution and perhydrolysis with no discolouration on storage.
