# Vulcanization method.

## Abstract
Vulcanization of rubber with sulphur using a polyether and at least one conventional accelerator in a concentration below the usual range, i.e. below a value of 1,3 by weight, calculated on the rubber. Particularly suitable are block polyethers from ethylene oxide and a 1,2 alkylene oxide having 12 to 20 carbon atoms. Further, it is of advantage to have the polyether and the usual accelerator together with other vulcanizing agents added to the rubber in accordance with the master batch procedure. These steps lead to a considerable reduction in the endan germent of health that may be due to the usual accelerators, but have no detrimental effect on vulcanization.

## Description
Vulcanization methodThe invention relates to a method of vulcanizing rubber with sulphur, use being made of a polyether and a conventional accelerator.The use of polyether together with conventional accelerators is wellknown in the art of cross linking the macromolecules of rubber with sulphur. In that process the two substances have different functions.According to the general literature in the art see Ullmann s Encyclo pädie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, 1980, keyword polyalkylene glycols polyethers are used in the rubber industry as dispersing agent, as mould release agent for moulded articles of rubber latex and solid latex, as lubricant both in the plastics and in the rubber processing industry, as emulsifier in the preparation of vinyl acryl copolymerisates.Further uses of polyethersin the processing of rubber are described inUllmann s Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, 1977, keyword Kauthschukchemicalien und Zuschlagstoffe according to which they are used as antistats or as extraordinarily effective plasticizers to impart high elasticity and low temperature flexibility to rubber articles, particularly of nitrile and chloroprene rubbers. Moreover, polyglycol ethers are used as emulsifiers in the processing of latex, because they do not affect the charge of the latex particles.Finally, the company magazine Pluriol EMarken of the firm of BASF, Dec. 1979, describes the use in the rubber industry of polyethylene glycol as activating dispersing agent for concentrated fillers. They have a favourable effect on the mechanical properties of rubber blends, such as stress values, tensile strength, elongation at rupture, shock elasticity, tear propagation resistance and hardness. This publication also describes the use of polyethylene glycol as polar additive to rubber blends in ultra high frequence vulcanization. As little as 10 phr is supposed to be sufficient for the transformation of field energy into vulcanization heat.The principle is particularly recommended for bright coloured natural rubber blends and for sPDM , butyl and SBR rubbe r blends.Sulphur alone reacts with rubber only very slowly, and only sufficiently at a high dose rate, and elevated temperature and when using a long vulcanization period, and moreover results in unsatisfactory cross linking efficiency and in unsatisfactory strength and aging properties of the vulcanizates. For these reasons accelerators are added. Under economical conditions these vulcanization accelerators lead to good vulcanizates. Well known vulcanization accelerators are, for example, 2 mercap tobenzothiazole, dibenzothiazyl disulphide, zinc salt of 2 mercaptobenzothiazole, benzothiazyl 2 cyclohexyl sulphenamide, benzothiazyl 2 tert. butylsulphenamide, benzothiazyl 2 sulphene morpholide, benzothiazyl dicyclohexylsulphenamide, diphenyl guanidine, di orthotolyl guanidine, ortho tolyl biguanide, tetramethyl thiuram disulphide, tetramethyl thiuram monosulphide, tetraethyl thiuram disulphide, dipentamethylene thiuram tetrasulphide, dipentamethylene thiuram hexasulphide, dihexamethylene thiuram tetrasulphide, dihexamethylene thiuram hexasulphide, zinc N dimethyl dithiocarbamate, zinc N diethyl dithiocarbamate, zinc Nd ibutyl dithiocarbamate, zinc N ethylphenyl dithiocarbamate, zinc Npentamethylene dithiocarbamate, ethylene thiourea, diethyl thiourea, diphenyl thiourea.The accelerators are generally used in a concentration of 1,5 to 10 per cent by weight, based on the rubber. As a result, the cross linking reaction of the rubber is reduced to a few minutes or even seconds at a relatively low temperature. Below 1,5 per cent by weight the vulcanization times for rubber articles become uneconomically long about 15 40 minutes .The accelerator concentration to be used, however, also depends on the nature and the amount of filler added. For the filler partly absorbs the vulcanization accelerator and thereby reduces its activity. To take full advantage of the accelerator, however, so called accelerator activators are added, such as diethylene glycol or triethanolamine. These substances serve to inhibit the detrimental effect on the vulcanization acceleratorso in themselves, however, they have no accelerating effect on the vulcanization process.In principle, the above mentioned accelerator activators and the vulcanization accelerators may be combined in any way desired. As a result, a great many different accelerator systems may be obtained one or several accelerators and their activators . They are also needed to meet the various demands made in actual practice on the vulcanization process and the vulcanizates.When vulcanization methods or vulcanizates are to satisfy new requirements, a skilled man will first of all try to make a suitable choice of known systems. This will be difficult, if not impossible, however, if most of the well known vulcanization accelerators do not meet these requirements, e.g. if the use of accelerators is to be refrained from because of their being detrimental to health in that they either contain harmful nitroso compounds as impurity or nitroso compounds may be formed from them during vulcanization. To avoid any risks it would be of advantage to refrain from the use of all amine co taining accelerators, or at least to considerably reduce their concentration and to avoid health hazards during processing.For, the chemicals used in the vulcanization process are generally used in the form of a powder. Formation of dust is normally unavoidable and may not only constitute a nuisance but also may affect the health of plant personnel.To exclude this risk of a dusty environment widely different solutions have been tried out. Powder preparation in paste turned out to be disadvantageous in further processing. Nor did coated powders provide any solution to the dust problem. The most favourable commercial form up to now has been that of granulated blends, the so called master batches.They are pre mixed granulates which contain only few constituents of the total mixture.For example one or several rubber chemicals may be embedded in a polymer which is compatible with the rubber mass. DL 61 864, US 3 179 637 and FR 1 136 571, for instance, describe the use of, respectively, polyvinyl ether, polyethylene and polyisobutylene as binder for one or more rubber chemicals. These polymers, however, are not compatible with all types of rubber. DT 2 123 214 describes granulates of blends of rubber chemicals and polymers based on the elastomers ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers or saturated ethylene propylene copolymers they all especial b dUrtdisplay unsatifactory storage stability. These granulates particular ly readily tend to become deformed or even totally unsuitable under the mechanical loads in the case of normal storage conditions. The present invention has for its object to provide a novel vulcaniza tion method in which hazards to health as a result of the use of well known vulcanization accelerators are reduced to the minimum possible extend without detrimental effect on vulcanization. To that end the following alternatives may be considered a preparing a novel accelerator, or b preparing an accelerator system having a lowest possible concentra tion of well known accelerators, or c preparing an accelerator in the form of a storage stable granulated pre mixture. The solution according to the invention appears from the claims. In principle it consists in that as accelerator system a polyether and a commonly applied accelerator are used. In that case the concentration of the usual vulcanization accelerator may be below 1,3 per cent by weight, based on the rubber, without this having any detrimental effect on vulcanization. The polyethers used according to the invention may be prepared by methods as described before for analogousproducts, e.g. by Houben Weyl, Metho den der organischen Chemie , Vol. 14, 24, 4third., 1963, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, pp. 436 450 Journal für praktische Chemie, 1965, pp. 300 303 J.A. Oil Chemist Soc., Vol. 38 1961 , pp. 410 418. Preference is given to homopolyethers and blockpolyethers, particularly blockpolyethers of the general formula I wherein on average a 5 to 115, more particularly 8 to 29, b O to 15, more particularly 0, c 1 to 12, R1 H and R2 an alkyl radical having 6 to 32, more particularly 10 to 16 carbon atoms.As examples of suitable monomeric, aliphatic, unsubstituted 1,2 alkylene oxides may be mentioned 1,2 epoxy hexane, 1, 2 epoxy heptane, 1,2 epoxy octane, 1,2 epoxy nonane, 1,2 epoxy decane, 1,2 epoxy undecane, l,2 epoxy dodecane, 1,2 epoxy tridecane, 1,2 epoxy tetradecane, 1,2 epoxy penta decane, 1,2 epoxy hexadecane, 1,2 epoxy heptadecane, 1,2 epoxy octadecane, 1,2 epoxy nonodecane, 1,2 epoxy eicosone, 1,2 epoxy uneicosone, 1,2 epoxy docosane, 1,2 epoxy tricosane, 1,2 epoxy tetracosane, 1,2 epoxy pentacosane, 1,2 epoxy hexacosane, 1,2 epoxy heptacosane, 1,2 epoxy octacosane, 1,2 epoxy nonacosane, 1,2 epoxy triacontane, 1,2 epoxy untriacontane and 1,2 epoxy dotriacontane.Preferred thereof are 1,2 epoxy decane, 1,2 epoxy undecane, 1,2 epoxy dodecane, 1,2 epoxy tridecane and 1,2 epoxy tetradecane because of their high reactivity and the fact that they do not present great handling problems.Such polyalkylene glycols are disclosed in US 4 312 768. It describes polyethers having a molecular weight of about 1000 to 75 000, prepared by bringing ethylene oxide or ethylene oxide and at least an alkylene oxide having 3 to 4 carbon atoms into reaction with at least one compound containing at least two active hydrogen atoms, followed by conversion with at least one olefine oxide having a carbon chain length of about 12 to 18 aliphatic carbon atoms and wherein said olefine oxide is present in an amount of 1 to about 20 by weight, based on the total weight of said thickener.Because of its being capable of unexpectedly causing the viscosity of water to increase, this polyether polyol thickener is used in the preparation of a concentrate for hydraulic fluid of for metalworking fluids in order to impart to water the properties of a lubricating fluid, e.g. resistance to pressure and corrosion inhibition. The concentrates claimed also may be used together with water as a flame retardant fluid which also acts as an excellent lubricant. From an ecological point of view they are superior to the wellknown mineral oil or glycol water mixtures. No mention is made of their use in the rubber industry. US 4 312 775, which corresponds to a great extent to the European Application 0061822, also describes these copolyethers as thickening agnet.They have a molecular weight of about 1000 to 75 000 and are prepared by reacting 1 ethylene oxide or 2 ethylene oxide and at least one alkylene oxide having 3 to 4 carbon atoms with at least one active hydrogen containing initiator and subsequently with at least one ccolefine having a carbon chain length of about 12 to about 18 aliphatic carbon atoms and wherein said a olef in oxide is present in an amount of about 1 to 20 per cent by weight, based on the total weight of said polyether.In the discussion of the prior art the following uses are mentioned for other polyethers as surfactant having favourable foaming properties, as detergent and as intermediate compound for the preparation of polyurethane. There is no mention of use in a vulcanization process.Of the various types of rubber it is particularly natural rubber NR , styrolbutadiene rubber SBR , polychloroprene CR , ethylene propylene rubber EPDM and polyisoprene IR that are of special importance to the present invention. They may be processed as solid rubber and, especially, as latex.The rubber may be vulcanized either while free of fillers or in the presence thereof. The method according to the invention is particularly suitable for use in the presence of fillers such as carbon black and silicic acid.A preferred vulcanizing agent is elemental sulphur. But also sulphur donors such as thiurams may be used.Of the well known vulcanization accelerators mentioned with reference to the state of the art the following are of particular importance to the present invention dithiocarbamates, thiurams, guanidines, sulphenamides and thiazols, more particularly dibenzothiazyldisulphide MBTS , benzothiazyl 2 cyclohexyl sulphenamide CBS , di orthotolyl guanidine DOTG and zinc N dibenzyl dithiocarbamate ZBEC .Whether and in what proportions these well known vulcanization accelera tore will be needed in addition to the polyethers will be very much dependent on the type of rubber and the filler.Vulcanization may further be considerably accelerated if to the accelerator system of a polyether and a well known vulcanization accelerator there is added a silane. As a result, not only the vulcanization time is drastically reduced, but the cross linking density is very much increased. For mixtures filled with silicic acid the following accelerator system has been found very satisfactory CBS DOTG, mercaptosilane and a polyether of the general formula I wherein Z O r a 5 to 115, b X O, c 1 and d 2. R1 H, H, R an alkyl radical having 10 carbon atoms, and 2 X H. The present invention not only consists in the fortunate choice of the nature and the concentration of the starting materials for the vulcanization process, but also in carrying out the process as follows the rubber chemicals are not added to the rubber separately but collectively in the form of a granulate this is followed by vulcanization under normal conditions. This so called master batch consists of 1 to 8 by weight of the polyether, 3 to 10 by weight of polynorborons or 3 to 25 by weight of saturated ethylene propylene copolymerisate or an elastomer of unsaturated ethylene propylene tert. monomers polymers, particularly with cyclopentadiene as third monomer and 82 to 95 by weight of other usual rubber chemicals, particularly vulcanization accelerators, anti agers, sulphur and or zinc oxide, the precentages by weight being based on the total vulcanization mixture.Of advantage are the following master batch recipes substances Parts by weightEMI8.1 tb 1.

This is partly due to the olefinically unsaturated groups contained in EPDM. Particularly surprising is that before the actual vulcanization process there does not take place any pre crosslinking of the polymer chain of the EPDM, which pre crosslinking has a detrimental effect on the processing properties. On the other hand, there is the advantage that later on in the vulcanization process the polymer is also cross linked and not only embedded as thermoplastic additive in the vulcanizate, as in the case of, e.g., DT 21 23 214, where use is made of a saturated ehtylene propylene copolymerisate.Further, the granulates according to the invention do not display any remaining stickiness.A further advantage to the granulate mixtures according to the invention is that the respective chemicals can be excellently worked up in the rubber mass. Their use not only results in a saving on time but also on energy because of the lower viscosity, and particularly on the required amount of rubber chemicals. As compared with commercial products the time needed for working up the granulates of the invention is at least up to 50 and that of the accelerator matter at least 58 shorter, based on the weight of the granulate. The available commercial products may contain, e.g., 80 accelerator, for the same effect the ganulates of the present invention only need 75 accelerator.The present invention offers many advantages The use of polyethers in order to influence the vulcanization reaction is not only less dangerous to health it also offers interesting advantages in the field of the art. The polyethers along with, for instance, silicic acid, constitute excellent cross linking accelerators, particularly together with mercaptosilane, for styrolbutadiene rubber SBR .In the presence of relatively small proportions of well known vulcanization accelerators they can be used for cross linking both unfilled and carbon black filled rubber, particularly natural rubber. On the ground of these advantages the vulcanization method according to the invention is particularly suitable for the manufacture of articles such as balloons, baby dummies, preservatives and safety gloves.The invention will be illustrated in the following examples. In them also a description is given of preferred embodiment of the inventions.1. preparation of the copolyether used according to the invention a Into a 2 1 three necked flask there are charged 0,44 moles of polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 2000 along with 0,02 moles of KOR 45 aqueous and melted under nitro gen, followed by evacuation at about 6,65 kPa and heating to about 1000C, at which temperature the mixture is kept under a vacuum for 30 minutes.

The resulting mixture is kept at 800C for 30 minutes under a stream of nitrogen. Subsequently, a water jet vacuum is applied 12 to 14 Torr with the mixture being heated to 1400C, the vacuum being maintained for 30 minutes.

The mixing equipment used comprised an internal mixer without float ing weight GK IV and a laboratory roll or an internal mixer with floating weight and a laboratory roll. The cross linking process was followed in so called rheometers. The rheometers comprise heated metal segments in the middle of which there is an oscillating disk moving through an angle of 1 3 , prefer ably at a rate of 100 oscillations per minute. The power input torque in 11,5 x m of the drive motor as a function of time is measured. The temperature was 1500C. A Carbon black filled natural rubber NR was vulcanized using 2 by weight of the polyether in accordance with Example Ib in the presence of the well known vulcanization catalyst dibenzothiazyl disulphide MBTS in concentrations of 0,6, 0,4, 0,2 and 0,0 by weight see Fig. 1, curves a, b, c and d . Moreover, MBTS was also used alone, namely in a concentration of 0,28 by weight see curve e .The rheometer curves in Fig. 1 show that the polyether alone also considerably accelerates the vulcanization process curve d that the polyether together with the well known catalyst MBTS leads to a normal vulcanization process see curve a , also when used in a concentration of less than 1,3 by weight that also when the well known catalyst is added in an amount of less than 0,38 by weight a suitable vulcanization is achieved curve c and that with the combination polyether MBTS the increase in vis cosity increase in cross linking density is greater than the sum of the individual effects compare curves e and d with c . The usefulness of the vulcanizates obtained appears from the measured values given in Table 4.

Abrasion indicated in a standard procedure as loss in volume in 3 mm of a sample passed under pressure and for some test distance over a standard abrasive. Compression set is determined by deformation 25 of a cylindrical test specimen, loading it for some time at a particular temperature, after which it is relaxed and loss of original thickness is expressed in compression set. Scorch is the time in minutes in which under the conditions during the Mooney viscosity measurement the onset of vulcanization solidi fication of the heated starting mixture leads to a viscosity rise of 5 Mooney units above the minimum value. t 90 90 vulcanization n time in min up to the 908 vulcanization which is considered adequate ensurance of the industrial manufacture of good quality products. t 100 100 vulcanization. This analogous designation of time in min. is of importance only for the determination of the afore mentioned times. Moreover, it is a measure of the resistance of a mixture to reversion reversion reduction of cross linking spots as a result of the continued effect of heat .B Unfilled rubber was reacted with 2,5 by weight of the polyether of Example lb see Fig. 2, curve 7 or with 0,1 by weight of the well known vulcanization accelerator Zn dibenzyl dithiocarbamate ZBEC see curve 8 or with the two substances together see curve 9 . Further data on the composition of the vulcanization mixture are given in Table 5. Figure 2 clearly shows the synergistic action between small amounts of the well known accelerator ZBEC and the polyether used compare the curves 7 and 8 with the curve 9 .
