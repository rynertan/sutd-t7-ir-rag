# Method of detecting the onset of melting in a resistance spot weld.

## Abstract
During a weld period in the formation of a resistance spot weld the weld parameters are monitored, and data represent ing the weld resistance curve and the power curve are acquired and stored for analysis by a suitably programmed computer. The derivative of R, namely R, is calculated and stored, and this derivative is divided by power P to obtain R P. The resistance curve is searched to obtain the maximum value R
