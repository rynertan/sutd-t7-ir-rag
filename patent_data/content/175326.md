# DIAGNOSTIC TEST SPECIMEN PREPARATION VIAL

## Abstract
A specimen preparation vial for collecting and prepar ing a specimen of fecal matter or other clinical specimen for a diagnostic test includesa sample dilution container 20 and a specimen collection dispenser top 50 . The sample dilution container 20 is shaped to contain a liquid in an in terior volume. The container 20 has an opening 34 di mensioned to receive the specimen and a sidewall which is yieldable upon manual squeezing. The specimen collec tion dispenser top 50 includes a cap housing 110 which is connectable to the specimen dilution container 20 for clos ing the opening 34 of the container 20 . A specimen col lection tool 130 is connected to the cap housing 110 and projects from the cap housing 110 so that the tool 130 ex tends into the interior volume of the specimen dilution con tainer 20 when the cap housing 110 closes the opening 34 of the container 20 . The specimen collection dispens er top 50 also includes a dispenser tip connected to the cap housing 110 . The dispenser tip 112 has a channel passing through it which communicates with the interior volume of the sample dilution container 20 when the cap housing 110 closes the opening 34 of the container 20 . An end of the channel defines a filtrate discharge orifice. A dispenser tip closure is provided for closing the filtrate dis charge orifice of the channel passing through the dispenser tip 112 . A microfiltration filter is located in the cap housing 110 in a liquid path extending from the interior volume of the sample dilution container 20 to the filtrate discharge orifice of the dispenser tip 112 so that the liquid flowing from the interior volume of the container to the filtrate discharge orifice passes through the microfiltration filter. The micro filtration filter has pores passing through it of dimensions effective to permit virus particle to pass through the pores and to block the passage of particles significantly larger than virus particles.
