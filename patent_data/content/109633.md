# Methods and apparatus for performing two and three dimensional chemical shift imaging.

## Abstract
Selective excitation is used to excite to resonance nuclear spins located in a predetermined region of an NMR sample. Variable amplitude gradients are then used to phase encode spatial information into the NMR signal produced by the excited nuclear spins. Fourier transformation of the NMR signal, observed in the absence of magnetic field gradients, yields information of the spatial distribution of chemical shifts in the predetermined region of the NMR sample. In NMR chemical shift imaging methods using multiple angle projection reconstruction techniques, projections are built up along a gradient point by point by use of selective RF pulses having variable frequency content. Non selective 180 RF pulses are used with the imaging methods to produce NMR spin echo signals.
