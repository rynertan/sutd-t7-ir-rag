# An adjustment mechanism.

## Abstract
A vehicle seat having a seat base frame 10 mounted on cross rails 12 is provided with a height adjustment mechanism comprising a pair of generally U shaped leaf springs 14 which constitute the sole support for the seat on the crossrails 12 . The leaf springs each have a pair of oppositely inclined upstanding tongues 18 connected to the seat base frame through pin and slot connections 32, 34 and, adjacent their upper ends, each pair of tongues 18 is connected by a rod 37 which serves both to stiffen the tongues 18 and also to effect adjustment of their inclination so as to vary the height of the seat base 10 above the rails 12 .
