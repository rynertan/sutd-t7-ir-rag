## Description
A Plug Valve The present invention refers to the valves having a rotatable spherical plug made of a suitable plastic material, such as polyvinyl chloride, which by a radially directed movement can be installed between, and can be removed from two co axial, opposed ends of a pipe forming part of any plant whatsoever. These valves comprise a valve body, in which the spherical plug is fitted between two co axial packing holding rings tightly assembled in the valve body, and carrying each not only the inner annular packing which cooperates with the spherical plug, but also an outer annular packing which is housed within a groove provided in the outside face of the respective packing holding ring, against the said outer packing there being compressed the inner end of a connector sleeve arranged co axially to the respective packing holding ring, and connected to the valve body by means of a ring nut in overlapping relation with an eternal step of the connector sleeve, and which is screwed on a threaded external portion of the valve body. The invention aims to provide a valve of the aforementioned type, which while still maintaining unchanged all its present advantages, as afforded by its construction and operation, can be easily and quickly converted at will into a valve in which the pressure against the spherical plug by the annular inner packings is self adjustable self adaustable model , as well as into a valve in which the pressure against the spherical plug by the annular inner packings is adjustable within certain limits, either initially or afterwards adjustable model . To this end, according to the invention, the tight seal between the valve body and at least one of the packing holding rings axially slidably fitted in the valve body, is guaranteed by means of an annular packing arranged around the packingholding ring and housed within a matching enlargement in the respective end of the valve body. Thus, when using a connector sleeve of the so called self adjusting type, the inner end of which, that is to say, its end facing the valve, has an outside diameter which is greater than the diameter of the enlargement in the respective end of the valve body, this connector sleeve once it has been mounted onto, and has been clamped by means of the ring nut against the outside end surface of the packing holding ring, abuts against the edge portion of the valve body, and is then confined in a fixed axial position.In such a position, the pressure against the spherical plug by the annular inner packing in the packingholding ring will be determined only by the resiliency of said inner packing and by the resiliency of the outer packing compressed between the packing holding ring and the connector sleeve, so that the said pressure is self adjustable, that is to say, it adjusts itself within the limits of the said resiliencies.When using instead a connector sleeve of the so called adjustable type, the inner end of which, that is its end facing the valve, has an outside diameter which is smaller than the diameter of the enlargement in the respective end of the valve body, this connector sleeve can be slidably fitted into the said enlargement in the valve body and can be axially driven to a smaller or higher extent thereinto, by accordingly more or less screwing the ring nut on the valve body, whereby the annular packing housed in the said enlargement will be resiliently compressed to a lesser or greater extent. Thus, by means of the adjustable connector sleeve and of the respective ring nut, it is possible to adjust at will the pressure against the spherical plug exerted by the annular inner packing housed in the packing holding ring. Both the ends of the valve may be constructed in the above described manner, that is to say, both the packingholding rings in the valve may be made axially slidable, and the right seal between each one of these rings and the valve body can be achieved by means of an annular packing arranged around the packing holding ring and housed within an enlargement in the matching end of the valve body. In this case, the either self adjusting or adjustable connector sleeves will be selected at will from a corresponding warehouse stock. However, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, only one of the packing holding rings is axially slidably fitted in the valve body, and the tight seal between the said ring and the valve body is guaranteed by an annular packing arranged around the packing holding ring and housed within an enlargement in the valve body, while the other packing holding ring is made integral, and preferably of one piece with the valve body the two connector sleeves associated with the valve are interchangeable, and one of them is made in form of a self adjusting connector, that is, with its inner end having an outside diameter which is greater than the diameter of the enlargement in the valve body, while the other one is made in form of an adjustable connector, that is, with its inner end having an outside diameter which is smaller than the diameter of said enlargement.According to whether it is wanted the self adjusting or the adjustable model of the valve, either the self adjusting or the adjustable connector sleeve will be mounted at the side of the axially slidable packing holding ring, while the other connector sleeve will be mounted at the opposite side of the valve, where it has no effect on the pressure against the spherical plug by the respective annular inner packing, since the corresponding packing holding ring is integral with the valve body, and therefore there is no annular packing between this ring and the valve body, nor a corresponding enlargement in the valve body for housing the said packing ring. These and other characteristic features of the invention and the advantages arising therefrom will become apparent in a more detailed manner in the following specification of a valve according to the invention shown in the annexed drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a valve according to the invention, in axial section and in the self adjusting condition. Figure 2 shows the lower part of the valve according to Figure 1, in axial section and in the adjustable condition. Figures 3 and 4 show in section and in an enlarged scale a detail of the tight seal between a packing holding ring and the valve body, respectively in the self adjusting and adjustable conditions of said valve. Figures 5 and 6 show in section and in an enlarged scale a detail of the tight seal between a packing holding ring and the valve body, respectively in the self adjusting and adjustable conditions of said valve, according to a modified embodiment of the invention. Referring to the Figures, reference numeral 1 denotes the body of a valve which by a radially directed movement can be installed between, and can be removed from two co axial, spaced apart ends not shown of a pipe forming part of any plant whatsoever . 3y the reference numeral 2 it is designated the spherical plug of the valve, which is provided with a through bore 3 having its axis on the spherical plug diameter, and which is rotatably fitted in the valve body, between two packing holding co axial rings 4, 5. The axis around which the spherical plug is rotated is perpendicular to the axis of its through bore 3, and it ie the very same axis of its control stem 6, rotatably mounted in a corresponding transversal tubular extension 7 of the valve body 1.At its inward end the control stem 6 is formed with an abutment annular flange 8 which by its flat surface bears against a matching internal surface of the valve body 1, facing the flange 8. The inner end face of the control stem 6 terminates with a projecting median portion 9 about which the spherical plug 2 is fitted by means of a groove 10 cut in the outer surface thereof, whereby the control stem 6 and the spherical plug 2 are coupled in rotation. The control stem 6 has a non circular outer end 11 on which there is engaged the handle 12 for controlling the valve.The tight seal between the control stem 6 and the tubular extension 7 of the valve body 1 is guaranteed by two superposed annular packings 13, 14, each housed within a respective, suitable annular groove 15, 16 in the control stem 6. The radial depth of each one of the grooves 15, 16 decreases along stem 6 from the interior to the exterior of the valve. Both packing holding rings 4 and 5 have each an annular packing 17 fitted on its inner side and cooperating with the spherical plug 2. In the outer face of each ring 4 and 5 there is formed a co axial annular groove 18, in which an annular packing 19 is housed. The packing holding ring 5 is integral, and is made of one piece with the valve body 1, while the other packing holding ring 4 is axially slidably fitted in the valve body 1. The tight seal between this slidable ring 4 and the valve body 1 is guaranteed by means of an snnular packing 20 embracing the outward end of the packing holding ring 4 and housed within an enlargement 21 formed in the mating end of the valve body 1. The enlargement 21 is constructed cylindrical in at least its outward inlet portion, and may have a conically tapering inward portion, as shown particularly in Figures 3 and 4. The above disclosed valve is provided with two connector sleeves MA and MR, each of which may be a male or female, smooth or threaded, and may be made in the same or in a different manner as for what concerns their connection with the respective pipe end. By their internal edge surface facing the valve, these two connector sleeves are sealed against the outer annular packing 19 held in rings 4, 5, and are axially bound to, and tightened against the respective packing holding ring 4, 5, each by means of a ring nut 23 screwed onto a corresponding threaded external portion 24 of the valve body 1, and being in overlapping relation with an external annular step 22 of the respective connector sleeveMA, ZR. The tight seal between the connector sleeve MA, R and the respective packing holding ring 4, 5 is guaranteed by the annular packings 19 at both ends of the valve body, which initially project a little out of the outside surface of the packing holding rings 4, 5, but are resiliently compressed by the corresponding connector sleeve MA, MR to a slight degree, and at the most until the connector sleeve comes to be. contacting the outside surface of the respective packingholding ring 4 or 5. By screwing out the two ring nuts 23 and by axially shifting same so as to move them onto the corresponding connector sleeve MA, MR and onto the connected pipes, it is possible to radially remove the valve body 1 from the pipes which are joined thereto. Just in a similar manner, also the valve body 1 can be radially installed, or mounted again, between the two pipes to which it is then joined as described by means of the ring nuts. Moreover, it is possible to separate from the valve the pipe joined to the connector sleeve at the side of the packing holding ring 5, which is integral of the valve body 1, and to leave the valve joined to the other pipe at the side of the axially slidable packingholding ring 4, which pipe may be also under load, since it might be closed by means of said valve. The two connector sleeves MA and MR may be mounted at will either on the one or the other end of the valve body 1, and their position is interchangeable. They however differ from each other in the outside diameter of their inner end 22, facing the valve. The connector sleeve MA, so called selfadjusting, has an inner end 22 of a greater outside diameter, and in any case of such a diameter, that when the said selfadjusting connector sleeve MA is mounted onto the valve bodyI side corresponding with the slidable packing holding ring 4, the said connector sleeve MA extends radially over and beyond the enlargement 21 and the respective packing 20, as far as the side edge portion of the surface of the mating end of the valve body 1.Therefore, when this self adjusting connector sleeve MA has been tightened by means of the ring nut 23, the said connector bears against the said side edge portion of the mating end of the valve body 1, thus compressing the annular packing 20 into the enlargement 21, as shown inFigures 1 and 3. In these conditions, the spherical plug 2, both packings 17 and the axially slidable packing holding ring 4 are clamped between the packing holding ring 5 and the self adjusting connector sleeve MA, which are both rigidly connected to the valve body 1. The pressure of both packings 17 against the plug 2 is then practically determined only by the resiliency of said packings 17 and to a small extent also by the resiliency of the outer packing 19, so that this pressure is self adjusting, and there is no need of effecting any adjustment of same from the outside. In these conditions, shown in Figures 1 and 3, the valve according to the invention is a so called self adjusting valve. The other connector sleeve MR, so called adjustable, has its inner end 22, facing the valve, of a smaller diameter, which in any case is smaller than the diameter of the enlargement 21 in the valve body 1, so that when the said adjustable connector sleeve MR is mounted onto the valve body 1 side corresponding with the slidable packing holding ring 4, the said connector does not extend radially beyond the said enlargement 21, and can slide into said enlargement 21, as it clearly appears in Figures 2 and 4.Therefore, it is possible to adjust the connector sleeve MR according to different axial positions, by more or less screwing on the ring nut 23 and by causing the connector sleeve to slide to a lesser or greater extent into the enlargement 21 in the valve body, whereby the annular packing will be accordingly compressed. In these conditions, the spherical plug 2, both packings 17 and the slidable packing holding ring 4 are clamped between a fixed member, which is the packing holding ring 5 integral with the valve body 1, and an axially shiftable member, which is the adjustable connector sleeve MR, so that the pressure of packings 17 is adjustable as desired by means of said connector sleeve MR and the respective ring nut 23. In the conditions shown in Figures 2 and 4, the valve according to the invention is a so called adjustable valve. The mounting of the self adjusting connector sleeve MA and of the adjustable connector sleeve MR onto the valve body 1 at the side of the packing holding ring 5 integral with the valve body 1 is not a problem, since in any case both of these connectors have their inner end of a diameter which is such as to permit the application of the ring nut 23. Both the self adjusting and adjustable connector sleevesMA and MR, respectively, will be suitably marked so as to be easily distinguishable the one from the other. In a modified embodiment of the valve according to the invention, both the valve ends are made as described and shown in connection with the valve end to the left hand side in Fugures 1 and 2, that is to say, at both sides of the spherical plug 2 there are provided axially slidable packing holding rings 4, each surrounded by an annular packing 20 housed within an enlargement 21 in the corresponding end of the valve body 1. The above described valves according to the invention are preferably made of a suitable plastic material, such as polyvinyl chloride. With particular reference to Figures 5 and 6, a modification is illustrated, according to which the tight seal between the packing holding ring 4 and the valve body 1 is obtained by adopting the same principle as illustrated in connection with the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, but with a different arrangement of the packing element which precisely provides for the tight seal between the ring 4 and the body 1.The packing element, which consists of an annular packing 120, is housed in an annular groove 104 obtained at the inner end of the packing holding ring 4 i.e. the end directed towards the spherical plug 2 . The enlargement of the valve body 1, cooperating with the said annular packing 120, is indicated by reference numeral 121. The other reference numerals are the same as those employed in the embodiments of Figures 1 and 2, since they indicate identical parts. Figure 5 represents a valve in the self adjusting condition, with the connector sleeve MA abutting against the edge of the valve body 1, while Figure 6 represents a valve in the adjustable condition, with the connector sleeve MR having the possibility of sliding into the enlargement 121. Many other modifications, particularly in the arrangement of the annular packings provided on the packing holding rings, are possible, without departing from the basic principle of the invention, as above described and as claimed hereafter.
