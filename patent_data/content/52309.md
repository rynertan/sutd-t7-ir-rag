# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor element.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a plurality of semiconductor elements from a semiconductor wafer in which a plurality of active elements are formed and is intended to provide particularly a semiconductor element manufacturing method which saves the semiconductor wafer from cracks or damage during the manufacture of a semiconductor element and enables a solder layer to be deposited on the element regions without irregularities in thickness. The method starts with the step of forming a first metal layer 12 acting as an ohmic electrode by wet plating on each side of the element regions of a semiconductor wafer 11 in which a plurality of active elements are formed or on the whole surface of each side of the wafer 11 .Then a second metal layer 14 which has an anticorrosive property and acts as a brazing material when the semiconductor element is mounted between a pair of electrodes, is formed on each of the element areas in the first metal layers 12 . Finally, those portions of the semiconductor wafer which are interposed between the active elements are chemically etched off with the second metal layers 14 used as masks to separate the semiconductor elements 15 from each other, thereby producing a plurality of semiconductor elements 15 , each of which has its surfaces coated with the first and second metal layers.
