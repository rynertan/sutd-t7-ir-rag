# A CHARGE AIR COOLER

## Abstract
A charge air cooler 10 is provided for mounting within the intake manifold 12 of an internal combustion engine. The charge air cooler 10 comprises a heat exchanger core formed by a plurality of lightweight heat transfer elements 34,36,38 defining a first flow path 42 for charge air prior to induction of the charge air into the engine, and a second flow path 44 for a coolant in heat transfer relation with the charge air. The heat exchanger core 10 supports at least one transversely extending rigid mounting sleeve 66 166 for receiving a mounting bolt 14 114,115 passed through a bolt receiving hole 74,76 in the intake manifold 12 to secure the charge air cooler 10 within the intake manifold 12 .
