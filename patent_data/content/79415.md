## Description
Discharging assembly for concrete auto mixer with side rotating shift winnowing device. The Invention refers to a discharge winnowing device for concrete automixers, to be brought from the transport position to the setting one as a prosecution of the discharging channel of the fixed part on the means by operating by manual traction only with sde rotating travel 1ç solidarily operating condition between the parts can be obt aineÅa by means of a quick engaging part. When the contrivance is disactivated, the divece can be brought again in transport position, which permits the shape return, by acting in the inversed sense by bearing it, up to the travel limit, to lay on a support helc by the relevant splash board.For discharging the auto mixers, at present, an additional duct lenght is foreseen articulated with a discharging channel fitted on a plane, to be brought by hand in lowering position. The mobility of this part is required to bring the product on the discharging point on the floor, into formwork shuttering or anything else, and in a non employ phase the return in shape for transport.The employ of the mobile part requires a manual alternate movement on a vertical plane when lowering to get settling and when rising to return to shape, it turns out to be particularly wearing and dangerous. For a sudden overturning or any movement whatever which should unbalance the catch settling, this part falls like a scissor motion on the operator. The invention enables to solve the problems by means of the connection of the initial articulQ ted part to the plane frame of the winnowing device on rotating knuckle with tide oo Ping, TO permiT the movement in only one sl dewise trip. This avoids the effort for supporting the part and, consequently, the dangerousness of the motion.From the transport position, where the end part of the winnowing contrivance lies on the support held by the relevant splash board, the winnowing part is brought by rotation with side trip into employ position, and the duct assembly is made solidarily opera . nag by means of a quick engaging device. For transport the bou nd is disactivated and the device is brought again on the splash board support by a side trip in the inverted sense. h not limiting execution version is illustrated by the drawings of Tables 1 and 2, where Fig. 1 is the side view of the duct as assembly in employ position and showing its supporting contrivance enabling its rotation as well as the inclination variability.Fig. 2 is the side view of the only duct of the winnowing device.Fig. 3 is the schematic view in correspondence of the two conduit components. Fig. 4 is the view of the duct assembly in employ condition. Fig. 5 is the view of the same assembly with unbound components and showing the discharging opening for the pro duct. Fig. 6 is the view of the conduit component assembly. The esecution form foresees the initial duct with converse 1 into which hopper 2 discharges the product this part is stabilized on the frame with the concrete mixer. Duct 1 is supported with rotating knuckle which allows the variability of the discharging point on an arc beyond 1800, on two arms lying on a vertical plane ne each arm is articulated on one of the ends of the vertical.pin 3 in coaxial seat on the vertex of bracket 4 with isosceles Eies and integral with the frame. Pivot.3 bears on its top crown 5 integral with a corresponding part 6 to operate altogether as a rotation plane of arm 7 supporting duct 1 on knuckle 8.Below, pin 3 is articulated in 9 to arm 10 that can be extended to lifting jack 10 supporting, on the other point, duct 1 in knuckle 11.By adjusting the duct assembly inclination, the height of the discharging opening can be changed according to the different requirements, such as discharging on the floor, into formwork shut terings or else. The winnowing device 12 is supported on a side rotating knuckle 13 on the discharging opening 14 of duct 1, an above channel 15 is foreseen which, in employ condition is set as a longitudinal prosecution for the duct. From the transport position, in which the lower end of 12 lies on arched support 16 held by splash board 17 which retains it, it is possible to bring opening 20 of the device on opening 14 by traction only on handles 18 e 19 in side trip and to compose thus the canalization. To make the conduit components integral, hook with quick engage ment is applied. Duct 15 brings the production or winnowing net 21 which keeps back the exceedingly large grains, permitting the pro duct discharge into the lower duct 22 from which it falls through opening 23. The winnowing device is equipped with net 21 supported on the four frame top points by elastic shock absorbers 24 that transmit the vibration effect of the vibrating assembly 25.This permits to increase the discharging speed. The material kept back, scrap of the discharge product, is discharged by opening door 27 on hinge 26 fitted on the top, by acting on tension rod 28.The devices are singularly variable and, if necessary, alternatively fitted on the two components.
