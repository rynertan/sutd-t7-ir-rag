# Method of covering tennis balls and tennis balls made by this method.

## Abstract
A method of adhering a textile fabric tennis ball cover 12,13 to a tennis ball core 22 comprises providing yarns 16 made from a hot melt adhesive in the cover fabric, fitting the cover around the core, causing the hot melt adhesive yarns 16 to melt and come into close contact with the core and the cover, and allowing the molten adhesive to re solidify so that it adheres to the cover and the core of the tennis ball with a high degree of tenacity. This method requires few steps, and is in consequence much quicker, than the conven tional method using a two part solvent based latex adhesive between the cover and the core.
