## Description
The present invention relates to hydroxymorpholine derivatives which have anti hyperglycaemic and or anti obesity activity, to processes for their production and to their use in medicine. European Published Patent Application No. 0140359 describes compounds of formula A wherein R The applicants have now discovered a class of novel hydroxy morpholine derivatives which have anti hyperglycaemic and or anti obesity activities. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicylic acid. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include metal salts, such as for example aluminium, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium and ammonium or substituted ammonium salts, for example those with lower alkylamines such as triethylamine, hydroxy lower alkylamines such as 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2 hydroxyethyl amine or tri 2 hydroxyethyl amine, cycloalkylamines such as bicyclohexylamine, or with procaine, dibenzylpiperidine, N benzyl β phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine, N, N bisdehydroabietylamine, glucamine, N methylglucamine or bases of the pyridine type such as pyridine, collidine or quinoline. Compounds of formula I always have two asymmetric carbon atoms, marked with asterisks in the formula. In addition when R³ is methyl, the carbon atom marked will also be asymmetric, giving rise to eight stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of enantiomers. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. Examples of compounds of formula I include The present invention also provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I or a salt, thereof, which process comprises cyclising a compound of formula II The reaction may suitably be carried out in an organic solvent, preferably butanone, at elevated temperature, preferably under reflux in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. The compounds of formula II and salts thereof are novel and as such form part of the present invention. Compounds of formula II can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula III The reaction between a compound of formula III and a compound of formula IV is suitably carried out under similar conditions to those described above for the cyclisation of the compound of formula II. Preferably the compound of formula II is not isolated but is converted to the compound of formula I in situ. Further according to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I or a salt thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V The reaction may be carried out in any suitable organic solvent, such as a C₁ ₄ alkanol or dimethyl sulphoxide, preferably at an elevated temperature. Salts of compounds of formula I may be produced by treating a compound of formula I with an appropriate acid, and may be recovered by conventional methods. Compounds of formulae III, IV, V and VI are either known compounds or can be prepared from known compounds by known processes or processes analogous to known processes. Compounds of formula I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics in Stereochemistry , Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971, Allinger, N.L. and Eliel, W.L. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using an optically pure starting material of known configuration. A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use. Usually the compositions of the present invention will be adapted for oral administration although compositions for administration by other routes, such as by injection are also envisaged. Particularly suitable compositions for oral administration are unit dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Other fixed unit dosage forms, such as powders presented in sachets, may also be used. In accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice the carrier may comprise a diluent, filler, disintegrant, wetting agent, lubricant, colourant, flavourant or the like. Typical carriers may, therefore, comprise such agents as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycollate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, sucrose and the like. Most suitably the composition will be provided in unit dose form. Such unit doses will normally comprise 0.1 to 1000 mg of the drug, more usually 0.1 to 500 mg and favourably 0.1 to 250 mg. The present invention further provides a method for treating hyperglycaemia in human or non human animals which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a hyperglycaemic human or non human animal. The present invention further provides a method for treating obesity in human or non human animals, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to an obese human or non human animals. Yet further according to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in therapy. In particular there is provided a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment of obesity or hyperglycaemia. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese humans the drug may be taken in doses, such as those described above, one to six times a day in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will generally be about 0.1 to 6000 mg, and more usually about 1 to 1500 mg. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese animals, especially dogs, the drug may be administered by mouth, usually once or twice a day and at about 0.025 mg kg to 25 mg kg, for example 0.1 mg kg to 20 mg kg. No toxicological effects would be expected at the above mentioned dosage levels. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples.

Female CFLP mice, weighing approximately 25 g, were fasted for 24 hours prior to the study. The compounds under study were administered orally as an aqueous solution to each of 6 mice. 30 minutes later a blood sample 10 µl was obtained from the tail for the analysis of blood glucose. Immediately after taking this blood sample, glucose lg Kg body weight was administered subcutaneously to each mouse. 6 mice were given water as a control. Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes. Compounds that produced a significant P 0.05 reduction of blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, were considered active. The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the administration of the glucose was calculated for each compound and compared with the value for control animals. The effect of the compounds on the energy expenditure of mice was demonstrated by means of the following procedure Female CFLP mice, each weighing approximately 24 g were given food and water
