# A hydraulic control system for an automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A manual valve 2 comprises a spool 2f having two lands 2f , 2f slidably disposed in a bore of a housing 2h for movement to a P range, a R range, a N range, a D range, a II range and a I range. The manual valve is formed with an inlet port 2g and five outlet ports 2a, 2e, 2b, 2c, 2d . The first and second outlet ports 2a, 2e are allowed to communicate with the inlet port 2g to receive a line pressure when the spool is set to R range. The second outlet port 2e is allowed to communicate with said inlet port when the spool is set to N range. The second and third outlet ports 2e, 2b are allowed to communicate with said inlet port when the spool is set to D range. The third and fourth outlet ports 2b, 2c are allowed to communicate with the inlet port when the spool is set to II range. The third, fourth and fifth outlet ports 2b, 2c, 2d are allowed to communicate with the inlet port when the spool is set to I range. The first inlet port 2a , second inlet port 2e , inlet port 2g , third outlet port 2b , fourth outlet port 2c and fifth outlet port 2d are arranged in this order along the axial direction of the spool.
