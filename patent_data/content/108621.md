# Process for producing non apertured spunlaced fabric.

## Abstract
Improved liquid barrier properties are provided to spun laced fabrics of woodpulp and synthetic organic fibers by employing closely spaced jets in a hydraulic entanglement treatment of the fibers. Additional improvement in barrier properties is provided by a finishing step which employs multiple passes under low pressure, closely spaced jets.
