# High impact melt flowable dual continuum melt mixed polymer blends of polypropylene, polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubber.

## Abstract
Melt mixed, melt flowable blends of polypropylene, at least about 30 polyethylene and from about4 to about 11 ethylene propylene copolymer rubber, and method for mak ing same, are disclosed. Such blends possess higher low temperature Izod and Gardner impact strength than conven tional impact polypropylene blends, while having a compar able or higher flexural modulus.
