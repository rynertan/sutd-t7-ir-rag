# Digital bit rate synchronizer for digital echo cancellers and similar signal processing devices.

## Abstract
In a digital echo canceller using an impulse response filter, an interpolating and synchronizing circuit is used to couple the received digital signals from the four wire circuit to the input of the filter. The interpolation and synchroniza tion circuit generates signals having values between the values of received digital samples, and these interpolated valves are then sampled at the send signal rate and supplied to the impulse response filter.
