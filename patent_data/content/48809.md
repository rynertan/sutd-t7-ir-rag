# Seat belt retractor structure.

## Abstract
In the retractor the housing has differential structural integrity. The retractor frame 12 has a rigid structure and contains the retraction and locking elements. A mounting flange 50 is connected to the frame 12 and is permitted to distort in a controlled fashion as a result of crash forces acting on the retractor, whereby the frame 12 remains substantially undistorted.
