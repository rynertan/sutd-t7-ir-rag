# HIGH REPETITION RATE, UNIFORM VOLUME TRANSVERSE ELECTRIC DISCHARGER LASER WITH PULSE TRIGGERED MULTI ARC CHANNEL SWITCHING, AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING SOLAR VOLTAIC CELLS USING A PULSED LASER BEAM

## Abstract
A high power excimer laser 10 embits a pulsed output at a high repetition rate in the ultraviolet wavelength region and a uniform power output across the laser beam 130 . By sub jecting doped silicon wafers 122 to the pulsed laser output, epitaxial regrowth of silicon crystals can be induced to repair damage to the silicon crystral structure which normally occurs during implantation of the dopant materials.
