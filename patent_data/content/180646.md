## Description
This invention relates to a composition applicable as a catalyst used to be exposed to combustion exhaust gas for rendering noxious gaseous components therein harmless by a redox reduction oxidation reaction, and also applicable as a sensor for detecting the stoichiometric air fuel ratio by measuring a large change in electric resistance. Noxious substances such as CO, HC hydrocarbons and NO As to the sensors for detecting the stoichiometic ratio of combustion, there is known the type in which platinum electrodes are set on both sides of the partition wall of stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte, one of said electrodes being exposed to an atmosphere where the partial pressure of oxygen is constant, such as air, while the other electrode being exposed to exhaust gas, thus forming an oxygen concentration cell, and a sudden change of its electromotive force is utilized for detecting the stoichiometric ratio, and the type in which a sudden change in electric resistance of a metal oxide such as SnO₂, TiO₂, MgCr₂O₄, etc., is utilized. At an air fuel ratio close to the stoichiometric ratio, the fuel is not perfectly burned and both reductive gases such as CO and HC and oxidative gases such as O₂ and NO Recently, attempts have been made to use perovskite type metal oxides for exhaust gas cleaning catalysts or gas sensors, and the present inventors have also filed a patent application featuring the use of a material Sr constituted by a transition metal M Co, Fe, Mn, Cr or V in the B site of said compound oxide ABO₃ and oxygen. When the temperature rises or the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere lowers to cause release of oxygen, said conductive pairs disappear to increase electric resistance. To make the average valence number rate of transition metal 3.5 is to maximize the number of said conductive pairs. The complex oxides of this type allow a greater reversible enlargement of oxygen loss than allowable for other oxides, although only to a point where δ is 0.5, but if the number of said conductive pairs is maximized, it becomes possible to enlarge the scope of change of resistance by release of oxygen, and this leads to a corresponding increase of sensitivity in use of said material for a sensor. To define the complex oxide composition to Sr The prior art disclosures closest to the present invention are Lucas U.S. Patent No. 4,454,494 and Hitachi, Ltd. U.S. Patent No. 3,951,603 , but these patents are different from the present invention in the following points in Lucas patent, La is not the essential component, and also the second substance SrMéO₃ Mé Ti, Zr, Hf is absent, while Hitachi patent has no SrMéO₃. The present invention provides a composition characterized by the addition of SrMéO₃ Mé at least one of Ti, Zr and Hf to the material of the formula Sr The present invention provides a sensor for detecting the air fuel ratio different from the stoichiometric composition of combustion by combining a sensor using said manifold functioning composition and an oxygen pump. Figs. 1 to 3 show the catalytic effect for cleaning gas when a mixed gas consisting of 40 ppm of NO₂, 150 ppm of CO and the remaining portion of nitrogen was passed through a sintered specimen of catalyst composition comprising Sr Figs. 13 15 show the exhaust gas cleaning effect in the case when Pd or Pt was further added to the specimens comprising Sr The present invention is described below with reference to the embodiments thereof. SrTiO₃ was mixed in the ratios of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 by mole in Sr These rates of change were as shown in Figs. 1 3. The CO removal rate became the highest when the amount of SrTiO₃ added was 20 60 by mole, and in this region an increase of activity by the addition of SrTiO₃ was seen. Also, there were seen a peak of NO formation rate at low temperature and a peak of N₂ formation rate at high temperature at SrTiO₃ content of 60 mol . Viewing generally, a remarkable improvement of catalytic cleaning performance was seen by the addition of 60 mol of SrTiO₃. In order to see the influence of dispersion of SrTiO₃, there were prepared two samples in one of which SrTiO₃ was merely mixed and in the other sample the mixture was further fired at 1,300 C for 3 hours, both samples containing 60 mol of SrTiO₃ which content gave high catalytic performance in Example 1. These samples were subjected to a comparative test for catalytic performance in the same way as in Example 1, and the results were shown in terms of CO removal rate, NO formation rate and N₂ formation rate in Figs. 4 6. The fired mixture showed a higher catalytic cleaning effect than the simple mixture in each case, but the difference was slight. It was noted that the addition of SrTiO₃ accounts for a substantial portion of the effect. In order to see the effect of the addition of SrTiO₃ on catalyst life, SrTiO₃ was added in a ratio of 60 mol to Sr The measured values were as shown in Table 1, and it is to consider that the addition of SrTiO₃ is conducive to the enhancement of catalytic performance and the prolongation of catalyst life, regardless of the type of substituting element at the B site. To Sr It is seen from Fig. 8 that in the sensor elements to which no SrTiO₃ was added, the change of resistance in the air according to temperature resembles the metallic pattern of change, but when SrTiO₃ is added, a semiconductor type change occurs in the low temperature region, and at around 60 70 mol comes out a zone where no change of resistance occurs in the temperature range capable of maintaining gas sensitivity. This phenomenon can be utilized for a temperature sensor to be used for the detection of firing and going out of fire or the detection of a fire, and when it is utilized for a sensor for detecting the stoichiometric composition of combustion, there is provided the advantage of not to necessitate the temperature compensation required in the sensors using TiO₂ or SnO₂. It is noted from Figs. 9 and 10 that in use of the product as a sensor for detecting the stoichiometric composition, the addition of SrTiO₃ in said amount range gives the highest effect for the increase of sensitivity and response. To Sr Fig. 11 shows the measured values of electric resistance. As evident from the graph, if a second material such as SrTiO₃, SrZrO₃, etc., is added in a proper amount 45 70 by mole , there can be obtained a product which shows high electric resistance in the low temperature region and shows no change of electric resistance in the air in the high temperature region where the detection of stoichiometric composition is possible. However, the proper amount differs slightly from one material to the other . The critical temperature differs depending on the type of the material added it is around 400 C in the case of SrTiO₃, around 200 C in the case of SrZrO₃ and around 250 C in the case of SrHfO₃. Mixing of a second material also makes it possible to select an intermediate critical temperature. Thus, by the addition of a second material, it is possible to change the critical temperature in the low temperature region according to the type of the second material but the sensor characteristics are unchanged to any significant degree, and in each case a high sensitivity and high response are provided in comparison with the products to which no second material was added. In order to see the effect of the addition of SrTiO₃ on sensor life, there were prepared sensors in which SrTiO₃ was added in an amount of 60 by mole to Sr It is seen that the addition of SrTiO₃ noticeably prolongs the sensor life regardless of the kind of Sr In order to see the effect produced on catalytic performance and sensor sensitivity by the addition of Pd or Pt in addition to the grain boundary forming agent SrMéO₃ Mé Ti, Zr or Hf shown in Examples 1 6, mixtures were prepared by adding Pd in amounts of 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 by weight and Pt in an amount of 0.6 by weight to the mixture made by adding SrTiO₃ powder in a ratio of 65 by mole to Sr It is seen that the addition of Pd or Pt improves the cleaning performance in the low temperature region. It is also noted that the combined use of Pt with the mixture of Sr Also, sensor samples were made by using said mixtures in the same way as in Example 4 except that the firing temperature was changed to 1,200 C, and the determination of their sensitivity was conducted. The determined values of sensitivity were as shown in Fig. 16, from which it is seen that the gas sensitivity is improved as is the catalytic performance especially in the low temperature region by the addition of Pd or Pt. The improvement of catalytic performance and sensor characteristics in the low temperature region may be accounted for by the fact that the migration of oxygen ions in the base is regulated by the transfer of charges in the base surface at low temperatures and decelerated, but the transfer of charges is promoted by the addition of Pd or Pt to accelerate the ionic migration. The sensor of the stoichiometric composition of combustion of Example 7, adapted as a detector, was combined with a zirconia oxygen pump to make a sensor for detecting the air fuel ratio other than the stoichiometric composition shown in Fig. 17. In the drawings of Fig. 17, numeral 1 denotes a zirconia electrolyte plate stabilized by adding 8 by mole of Y₂O₃, 2 the electrodes formed by baking the oxygen pump forming Pt paste at 900 C for 30 minutes on said electrolyte plate 1, 3 a SrTiO₃ layer screen printed on one said electrodes, and 4 a sensor for detecting the stoichiometric composition, which was screen printed on said SrTiO₃ layer. In this example, SrTiO₃ was added in amounts of 30, 60 and 80 by mole to Sr The results were as shown in Fig. 18, from which it is seen that the electric resistance of the detector is changed sharply when a pump current corresponding to excess oxygen is flown regardless of the content of SrTiO₃. This means that if the current of the oxygen pump is set to a proper value, it is possible to detect the air fuel ratio other than the stoichiometric composition from the sudden change of electric resistance. In this case, since the detector merely undergoes a sudden change of resistance at a point where its surrounding gas reached the stoichiometric composition, the detector sensitivity is naturally high at the SrTiO₃ content of around 60 mol . Although no data were shown about its life, it is considered that its life is also long in this area of composition. It was also found that the sensors using a ceramic substrate mainly composed of strontium titanate, as compared with those using an alumina type or silica type ceramic substrate, are limited less than 5 in change of electric resistance even in the tests of 5,000 cycles and were improved in life. The compositions in said examples may be a mixture or a fired product of Sr As described above, in accordance with this invention, by adding SrMéO₃ Mé Ti, Sr or Hf to Sr
