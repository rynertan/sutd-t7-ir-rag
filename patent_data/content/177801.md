# Radiation image read out method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a radiation image read out method and apparatus wherein preliminary read out is conducted prior to final read out for adjusting final read out conditions and or im age processing conditions for a radiation image stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet, the light detection range of a light detector for detecting light emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet upon exposure to stimulating rays in the preliminary read out is changed in accordance with radia tion image recording conditions, so that the emitted light is detected over the whole light emission intensity range fixed by the image recording conditions.
