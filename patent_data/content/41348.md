## Description
DESCRIPTIONA METHOD OF ASSESSING THE COLOUR IN DIAMONDS AND OTHER GEMS AND A SET OF DIAMONDS OR OTHER GEMS GRADED BY THE METHOD This invention relates to the assessment of colour in diamonds and other cut gems. A perfect diamond crystal would be expected to be completely colourless and would, therefore, transmit equally well all radiation with wavelengths from 380 nanometres nm to 750 nm i.e. the wavelengths constituting white light. The majority of diamonds, however, display some colour due to the presence of defects. These defects cause the diamond to absorb selectively at one or more regions within the visible wavelength range thus causing an imbalance in the mixture of wavelengths which make up the white light incident upon it and producing a sensation of colour. A defect which imparts colour to the host crystal in this manner is called a colour centre . Traditionally, the colour of a cut and polished diamond, especially one in the range from colourless to yellow, known as a Cape series diamond, has been estimated visually by comparing the stone in question with a pre selected set of stones of increasing depth of yellowness. Various systems of standard colour samples have evolved in different parts of the world, for example1 the GIA Gemological Institute of America and AGS American Gemological Society systems in theUSA as well as the CIBJO Confederation Internationale de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie, Orfevrerie des DiamantsPerles et Pierres and the German RAL standard. The visible method of colour grading is clearly open to criticism since it is a subjective test which is likely to vary from person to person depending on such factors as genetic characteristics, experience in colour assessment, age and sex.Furthermore, the ability of any individual to grade consistently from day to day is influenced by physical factors such as the nature of the ambient illumination, and by physiological factors such as the state of the dark, light and colour adaption of the eye and state of health. In consequence, therefore, inconsistencies inevitably arise. These factors are well recognised and various techniques have been devised to obtain a truly objective and reproducible colour measurement.For the most part, these measurements have been made making use of direct colorimetry. However, these prior art techniques have not been wholly satisfactory and although they are objective it has frequently been found that the results obtained conflict with those obtained by skilled graders. Clearly, therefore, a technique which may be objective is unsatisfactory if it is not acceptable to graders. The present invention relates to a method whereby it is possible to obtain a truly objective set of measurements which do not conflict with assessments made by skilled graders. According to the present invention there is provided a method of assessing the colour of a diamond or other gem which comprises determining the proportion of diffuse light incident upon the gem which is transmitted by the gem. The present invention resides in the realisation that methods which involve the use of a substantially linear beam of light with which to probe the gem cannot give wholly reliable results. Thus any method or instrument using a directed light beam must always be suspect. In contrast, by using completely diffuse light it is possible to obtain a truly objective and reliable means of assessing colour. In order to come to this conclusion it is necessary to consider the path of light entering the table of a brilliant cut diamond. It is well known that if light impinges upon an interface between materials of different refractive indices from the side of the material of greater RI there is a critical angle from the perpendicular 9c above which all light is reflected. Below this value some of the light is reflected and some is refracted. If Gi is the angle of indicence then it can be shown that the reflected intensity varies from 100 when 9i is 24.50 0c or more but less than 20 when ei is 200 or less. Accordingly, for the angular range 20 to 24.5 there is a very rapid change in the reflected intensity.Likewise, the energy transmitted corresponding to refraction also varies very rapidly over this small range of angles of incidence. If one considers a roughly parallel beam of light perpendicular to the table of a brilliant cut diamond this beam will, in general, be totally internally reflected by one pavilion facet because the ray will impinge upon the facet at an angle of incidence greater than 24.50.. The ray then proceeds to the opposite pavilion facet where again it is found that the angle of incidence is such that total internal reflection takes place. After this, the ray proceeds back towards the front of the stone where1 depending on the extent of the table, it impinges either on the table or on one of the crown facets.It is found1 that the ray will generally impinge upon the table or the crown facet at an angle below the critical angle Oc. The exact angle for a particular ray depends firstly upon the original angle of incidence of the ray when falling upon the stone from outside but, more particularly, very sensitively upon the precise cut of the stone, the most important parameters in this respect being pavilion depth and table diameter. In these circumstances, it will be appreciated, therefore, that at this interface some of the light will be reflected and some will be transmitted.Thus when one integrates this effect for all the rays present in the light beam falling upon the stone it can be appreciated that the amount of light escaping from the stone at this stage depends sensitively upon the cut. The light which is not refracted at this stage is re reflected back into the body of the stone where it undergoes a further series of reflections at various facets, with possible refraction at each internal reflection depending on the angle of incidence at each facet. Since the colour of a stone depends upon the absorption of particular wavelengths from the beam of light passing through it and the amount of absorption depends in turn not only on the concentration of colour centres in the diamond but also on the path length of the beam within the stone it can be seen that the apparent colour of a particular stone when determined instrumentally depends sensitively upon the cut. Thus it is quite conceivable that an instrument evaluation may contradict the order in which the eye places a series of stones. Clearly, the apparent colour measured in this way will depend upon the degree of collimation of the incident light beam, its cross section or shape and area as well as on the size and cut of the stone. Any method or instrument which attempts to measure colour by probing the stone with a more or less directed parallel or slightly convergent incident beam and then measuring the transmitted light will be subject to greater or lesser degrees of uncertainty. In order to overcome this difficulty, according to the present invention, a perfectly diffuse source of light is used. In this way, light strikes the surface of the stone at all different angles as, indeed, is the case when a grader examines a stone with his own eye, so that the cut of the stone does not affect the results. It will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to all methods and instruments which assess the colour of diamonds and other gems colorimetrically.In particular, therefore, it is applicable to the GIA,Dutchburn, Eickhorst and Horchler systems which involve either assessing the degree of transmitted light at a particular wavelength believed to be responsible for colour, for example 415 nm caused by the so called N3 centre, or at, for example, three widely spaced points in the spectrum using, for instance, red, green and blue filters. The present invention is, however, particularly applicable to the method described in British Patent SpecificationNo 2 036 360 where a light of a given single wavelength is projected at the gem, the proportion of incident light transmitted by the gem is determined and this determination is repeated for different wavelengths of light over the visible wavelength range so as to obtain a transmission spectrum and the chromaticity co ordinates are calculated therefrom.In this method considerable care has to be taken to align the gem so as to make the axis of the beam of light co linear with an axis of symmetry of the gem which is normal to the table of the gem. It will be appreciated, though, that this very accurate arranging of the gem is unnecessary in the process of the present invention. The present invention also provides a device which is suitable for illuminating the gem with diffuse light such that the light transmitted can be measured accurately. This device comprises1 in effect, an integrating sphere. This typically takes the form of a hollow box having two holes on opposite sides. The box is coated with a perfectly diffuse reflector at all wavelengths. This is well approximated in practice by coating the inside of the sphere with specially prepared barium sulphate or magnesium oxide paint.One of the holes of the sphere is to allow a beam of light to enter it and the other is to receive the specimen. In the box, between the two apertures, is placed a baffle which is similarly coated with a diffuse reflector. As a result, the light entering the box impinges upon this baffle which has the effect of diffusing the light completely. The gem is secured in the other hole of the box in a completely light proof manner so that all light leaving the box does so as a result of transmission through the gem. Typically, the gem can be mounted in a holder, for example a ring, having a tapered opening1 typically a frusto conical opening. The diamond is inserted table first into the larger diameter opening and it can be secured in position with the aid of, for example, barium sulphate powder. It will generally be most convenient to arrange the holder in a light proof manner in the hole in the sphere with the table of the gem facing into the sphere. It will, however, be appreciated that it is not necessary for the table of the gem to be aligned precisely normal to the axis of the two holes. A typical arrangement of holder is illustrated in the Figure of the accompanying drawing. In theFigure which is not to scale a wall, 1, of the sphere possesses a hole, 2. A diamond, 3, is mounted in a ring, 4. The ring 4 is held in light proof manner in the hole 2 with the aid of a threaded collar, 5, which threadedly engages threads 6 in the wall, 1. The ring 4 is equipped with an upstanding annulus 7. The ring 4 together with its annulus 7 is coated with barium sulphate to diffuse the light. The annulus is provided to eliminate the possibility of light, which has been transmitted by the stone, impinging upon a surface, for example of the collar 5, which might introduce a stray colour in the measurement. The diamond, 3, can be secured in the ring 4 by being pressed into the barium sulphate powder. If the method of the present invention is to be used following the procedure described in BritishSpecification No 2036360 then the integrating sphere with the gem mounted in it is secured to the principal integrating sphere, provided with a photodetector, which is described in the said application, with the gem at the entrance port of the sphere. The light source is conveniently from a spectrophotometer, the principal component of which is a monochromator, usually a defraction grating, which provides a beam of light of a single wavelength. This wavelength may be continuously varied over a predetermined range, generally from about 740 nm down to about 380 nm. At each wavelength the light which is transmitted by the gem passes into the principal integrating sphere and the photodetector or photocell measures the percentage transmitted as a function of wavelength thus providing a transmission spectrum. The subsequent measurements and calculations can then be carried out precisely as described in British Specification No 2036360 to which reference should be made for further details. It will, however, be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to a method involving the calculation of chromaticity co ordinates and that any prior art method involving the use of a beam of light to measure colour can be adapted, according to the present invention, using a diffuse light source rather than a directed light source. Chromaticity co ordinates have been calculated using the method of the present invention and a set of stones of different grades obtained.Good correspondence has been obtained between the set composed in this way and standard sets composed by experienced graders using the naked eye.
