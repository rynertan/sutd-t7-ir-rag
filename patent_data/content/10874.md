# Process for separating optical isomers of substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acids amine salts of substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acids a substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acid.

## Abstract
A process for separating the individual optically active isomers of cis or trans cyclopropane carboxylic acids which comprises the step of treating an aqueous solution of a soluble salt of the recemate or diastereoisomeric mix ture with just sufficient of a suitable optically active amine to cause precipitation of one isomer or diastereoisomer of the cyclopropane carboxylic acid as the amine salt, whilst substantially all of the other isomer or isomers if more than two are present in the mixture remains in solution as the soluble salt. The process can be used to sepa rate cis 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoroprop 1 en lyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid from a cis mix ture.
