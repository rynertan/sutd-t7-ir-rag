# A process for producing reinforced polyurethane tires.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing a reinforced tire utilizing polyurea or polyurethane formula tions having low hysteresis. The polymer having low hys teresis is formed by reacting a prepolymer of an aromatic isocyanate and a high molecular weight difunctional polyol with a chain extender mix comprising an aromatic diamine and difunctional polyol. In these compositions the aromatic diisocyanate and aromatic diamine are selected so that there is substantial symmetry between the molecules. The rein forcement used is preferably an aromatic polyamide.
