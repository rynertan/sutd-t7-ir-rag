# Stalling cage provided with a mobile fodder trough.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a stalling cage 5 provided with a mobile fodder trough 3 which can be extracted from or disposed in the cage, so regulating the timing of the meals.

## Claims
Claims r 1. A stalling cage comprising a container and a grid which can be removably fixed to the container, the grid being provided with a drinking vessel and a fodder trough, wherein the fodder trough comprises a mobile part containing The fodder and a fixed part acting as the seat for the mobile part. 2. A cage as claimed in claim 1, wherein that portion of the mobile part which projects from the bottom of the fixed part is oorsfituted partly or entirely by a profiled grid. 3. s cage as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the fixed part of the fodder trough is provided with a door which closes when the mobile part of the fodder trough is extracted and opens when the mobile part is inserted into the fixed part. 4. A cage as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein the door is of an anti friction plastics material. 5. A cage as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein the base of the mobile part of the fodder trough is lower than the base of the drinking vessel0 6. s cage as described and illustrated in the accompanying figures.

## Description
Stalling cage provided with a mobile fodder trough.This invention relates to a stalling cage provided with a mobile fodder trough containing fodder which can be made accessible or inaccessible to the stalled animal.Where reference is made hereinafter to the mobile fodder through this signifies either the fodder trough alone or the drinking vessel alone or the two together0Research on animal feeding has been developed only recently, and beoau se of this problem of designing and constructing stalling cages able to supply fodder and possibly beverages to the stalled animals in a simple manner without disturbing the animals has not as yet been solved.A further problem has been to prevent the animal escaping during the refilling of the fodder trough.The first problem has been solved by a new cage comprising a fodder trough constituted by a fixed part and a mobile part the former consti tuting the seat for the mobile part which contains the fodder1 and the latter being able to be driven with a suitable vertical motion, for example downwards for inserting and upwards for extracting the noble part of the fodder trough.The second problem has been solved by disposing a door in the fixed part of the fodder trough, which opens on inserting the mobile part into the fixed part and closes on removing the mobile part. I preferred ambodiment of the invention is represented by way of non li sited example in the following figures in which s Figure 1 is a front view of the mobile part of the fodder trough Figure 2 is a side view of Figure 1. flgare 3 is a front view of the fixed part of the fodder trough and of the water bottle resting on the grid. fpigure 4 is a side view of figure 3 with the mobile part of the fodder trough shown in dashed and dotted lines. Figare 5 is a view of Figure 3 from above, showing the door closed. FiRure 6 is a side view of the containervor which the grid of Figure. 3, 4 and 5 can be fitted. Figure 7 is a front view of the container of Figure 6.The mobile fodder through 3 is contituted by a hollow parallelepiped which is tapered lowerly and is closed by a grid 17, and is provided iip perly with a plate 1 comprising two fixing holes 2.The food which fills the fodder trough of Figure 1 projects from the grid and can be easily reached by the animal0 The bottle month is at a greater distance from the floor than the bottom of the mobile part of the fodder trough, as can be seen in Figure 3.The fodder trough 3 can be inserted into the box 71 in which case it lies as shown by dashed and dotted, lines in Figure 4 In particular Figure 4 shows that a door 8 is hinged to the fixed part of the fodder trough and is kept closed, i.e. in a horizontal position1 by a spill spring 9. The door 8, which when closed ensures that the animals cannot escape from the cage, can be opened into a vertical position by the mobile fodder trough when this is inserted into the fixed part. The fodder trough 3 7 and the drinking vessel 4 are supported by the grid 12, which is supported by the flanges 13 of the container 5 to which it can be fixed in a mobile manner to the projections 14 provided on the container 5 by the hooks 10 and 11. The containers are also provided with four projections 16 for stacking the empty containers. Is stated initially the fodder trough comprises a mobile part which can be inserted into or extracted form the cage. The timing of the animal s meals can be regulated automatically in a programmed manner by us known apparatus, not described herein.Preferably the door 8 is constructed at least partly of an anti friotion material in order to prevent noise which can damage the animal.
