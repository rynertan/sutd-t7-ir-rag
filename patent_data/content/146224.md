# Toothed belt drive.

## Abstract
A toothed belt drive system wherein either or both of the belt teeth 13 and pulley grooves 14 include, in cross sec tion, elliptical arcuate portions coordinated with circularly arcuate portions in providing resistance to cracking, mini mizing of tapping noise by engagement of the belt groove roots with the pulley teeth, smooth withdrawal of the belt from the pulley, and abrasion of the belt groove root por tions. The tooth and pulley groove configurations may in clude rectilinear portions 15 . Preferred angular relation ship between the elliptical arc axes and dimensions of the different portions of the belt teeth and pulley groove con figurations embodying the invention are disclosed.
