# Amplifier with signal dependent voltage supply source.

## Abstract
In a combination of an amplifier 2, 5, 6 and a signal dependent voltage supply source 16 23 coupled thereto a portion of the signal from the signal source 1 is applied by an amplifier 9 to a comparator 16 , the output signal of which controls a limiter 20 21 . A portion of the output signal thereof is applied as a feedback signal to a second input of the comparator 16 by means of a low pass filter 22 and a feedback network 23 in series. The feedback loop thus formed is such that it oscillates at a comparatively high frequency. Then a signal dependent modulation of the pulse width and or the pulse density occurs at the limiter output. A supply voltage for the amplifier is derived from the output of the filter 22 . Owing to the high feedback factor of the feedback loop at the signal frequencies the supply voltage can adequately follow the output signal of the amplifier, independently of component tolerances and any load variations.
