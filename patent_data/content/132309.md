# NOVEL REGULATABLE EUKARYOTIC PROMOTER ELEMENT

## Abstract
Novel DNA sequences useful as portable divergent promoters for inducible simultaneous transcription. Specif ically, galactose induced promoters for GAL 1 10 genes are provided on a single fragment for use with foreign genes, where simultaneous transcription can be induced with ga lactose. Constructs are prepared providing self replication in a eukaryotic host.
