# Secondary battery.

## Abstract
A secondary battery having at least one electrode made from a polymer having conjugated double bonds in a main chain such as polyacetylene can be improved remarkably in charge discharge cycle life by making the electrode surface area of the negative electrode larger than that of the positive electrode.
