# METHOD FOR TREATING A RADIOACTIVE WASTE LIQUID

## Abstract
In a method of removing colloidal substances and suspended solid from waste liquid, oxine impregnated acti vated charcoal is employed as an adsorbent in lieu of powdery ion exchange resin. The oxine impregnated acti vated charcoal is easily precoated onto filter elements and peeled off after saturated adsorbing capability. The spent adsorbent is dried and incinerated at about 700 C. The volume of radioactive solid waste can be reduced less than 5 of the original volume of the spent adsorbent by the incineration.
