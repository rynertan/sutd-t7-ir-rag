# A METHOD OF PREVENTING THE OCCURRENCE OF CORROSION OF AMALGAM FILLING MATERIAL FOR DENTAL PURPOSES, AND AMALGAM FILLING MATERIAL THEREFOR

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of preventing the occurrence of corrosion of amalgam filling material for dental purposes, wherein a protective layer preventing continuous precipitation of metal from the amalgam filling and consisting of metal phosphates not easily dissolved in saliva, is caused to be formed along the exposed surfaces of the amalgam filling by initially incorporating phosphate ion donators in the amalgam filling material in the existing surroundings. The invention also relates to a dental amalgam for preventing the occurrence of corrosion, for performing the method, wherein the dental amalgam contains phosphate ion donators in a quantity of up to 0,5 phosphor calculated on the weight of the amalgam filling material.
