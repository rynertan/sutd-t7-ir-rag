# Winding apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for winding cable on to a spool comprises a movable table 11 on which at least three spools may be located. The table is mounted substantially horizontally such that the spools may be located thereon with their longitudin al axes substantially vertically upright. The table is movable between three positions a loading position 12 where an empty spool is loaded on to the table a winding position 13 where a spool is rotated and cable 2 is wound on to the spool and an unloading position 14 where a wound spool is removed from the table. There is also provided first lifting means 15 for loading a spool on to the table, second lifting means 16 for removing a spool from the table, means 30 for loading the cable on to a spool, means 38 for cutting the cable, and a programmable controller adapted to control the sequence of operations.
