## Description
A MEMBRANE TREATING AGENT FOR REJUVENATING AND IMPROVING A SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANEThis invention relates to a membrane treating agent for rejuvenating or regenerating and improving semipermeable membrane performance, especially for reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration membranes, to a membrane treated by the membrane treating agent and also to a treatment process using the membrane treating agent.In recent years, much. research and development has taken place in an effort to obtain an excellent semipermeable membrane which is useful for producing fresh or potable water from such sources as sea water or brackish water, for the treatment of polluted water, for the concentration of orange juice or milk and for the recovery of useful materials from such sources as metal plating sewage or electrodeposition painting sewage. This is desirable because such procedures are in need of no phase transition, no temperature change and use less energy than other purification methods.In general, the membrane performance of a reverse osmosis membrane is expressed in terms of both solvent permeability and solute rejection. Solvent permeability is the quantity of permeated solvent per unit period and unit area, generally in terms of m3 m2 day. Solute rejection is calculated as follows Solute Rejection EMI1.1 wherein CO is the concentration of solute in the feed solution and C is the concentration of solute in the permeated. solution. At the present time, semipermeable membranes produced for reverse osmosis are composed of either asymmetric membranes or composite membranes.Asymmetric membranes have been produced from various polymeric materials such as cellulose derivatives, polyamides, polyimides, polybenzimidazo es, polyarylene oxides, polysulfoneamides and other polymeric materials, in which the semipermeability of the membrane resluts from the function of a thin dense skin layer located at one surface of the membrane, with the remaining major part of the membrane providing a more porous supporting layer formed by the same polymer.On the other hand, the composite membranes such as those called PA 300 and NS 200 , etc. have been developed recently, wherein the semipermeability results from the function of an ultrathin solute barrier layer of one material which is formed separately and is supported on an underlying porous substrate that may be made from a different polymer from the ultrathin film.The performance of the membrane is determined by the thickness of the thin dense skin layer or the ultrathin solute barrier layer. Accordingly, a thinner layer leads the membrane to higher performance, especially in respect of solvent permeability.It is accordingly difficult to obtain a high performance semipermeable membrane having good solute rejection, because the thin dense skin layer or the ultrathin solute barrier layer possesses poor resistance to deformation and abrasion at the time of membrane fabrication and of membrane element fabrication. In addition, when a semipermeable membrane made of cellulose acetate has been used for substantial periods of time, the decrease of rejection performance of the membrane may have been caused by hydrolysis of tlle membrane.Moreover, when semipermeable membranes or melnbralle elements are free of faults, defects in tlie thin dense skin layer or the ultrathin solute barrier layer may be caused by minor mechanical shocks or deformation during long term operation of reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration. Therefore, it is important to be able to treat the membrane with a supplemental material in order to improve or to rejuvenate the solute rejection performance of the membrane. Various materials have been hitherto proposed for improving the rejection performance of semipermeable membranes. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,877,978 discloses such treatment using a supplemental polymeric material containing a substantial amount of acetyl groups comprising a copolymer of vinyl acetate and acids such as maleic acid, crotonic acid and lower alkyl esters of acrylic acid G.L. Dalton et al have recently reviewed the supplemental polymer coatings in revise osmosis improvement and regeneration in 1 DESALINATION 1 24, 235 1978 . But these materials could only be applied for rejuvenating a membrane which has degenerated over long term operation, or which has a mechanical defect.It is an object of the present invention to provide a membrane treating agent which is useful not only for rejuvenation of a degenerated semipermeable membrane but also for improvement of the semipermeable membrane without proportional decrease in the flow rate of water therethrough.Another object of the present invention is to provide a membrane treating agent which can be applied without troublesome procedures in use.In accordance with the present invention, the yield rate of the membrane and of the element can be heightened by apply ing the membrane treatment for overcoming the defects. The useful life of the membrane can be lengthened by means of the rejuvenation treatment. A high performance, particular ly rejection performance of the membrane, can be attained with a membrane treating agent of this invention to the previously unattained level of normal membrane fabrication methods.In the description which follows specific characterizations will be used and reference will be had to drawings and to specific examples all in the interest of clarity of explanation. These terms and references are not intended to define or to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined in the appended claims. IN THE DRAWINGSThe Figure is a diagram showing change of the membrane performance of a semipermeable membrane treated with a membrane treating agent of the present invention. In the drawing, 1 represents initial membrane performance 2 represents degenerated membrane performance 3 represents rejuvenated membrane performance, and 4 represents improved membrane performance.Referring now to the modified vinyl polymers which are effective for rejuvenating and improving a rejection performance of semipermeable membranes in accordance with the present invention, each has an acetoxy group and at least one group comprising either or both of the Formulas I and II EMI4.1 II o R CooH n wherein R is a radical selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, aromatic and heterbcyclic radicals having 1 to 9 carbon atoms, and n is an integer from 1 to 3. Examples of groups represented by the Formula I are the following groups represented by the Formulas A to G , the preferable ones being A and B EMI5.1 Examples of the groups represented by Formuls II are the following H O CH2COOH I O CH2CH2COOH The modified vinyl polymers can be derived from homopolymers or copolymers of vinyl acetate. Ethylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, N vinyl pyrrolidone etc. can be employed as a comonomer with vinyl acetate.In the concrete, the modified vinyl polymers of the present invention are polymers having repeating units represented by the Formula III as the polymer main chain EMI6.1 wherein a, b and c are molar fractions which satisfy the following equations 0.9 a , 0.2 a b c t 0.8 b b , 0.1 0.4 c 0 and wherein X is at least one radical selected from the group represented by the Formulas I and II and Y is at least one radical selected from the group consisting of OH, 5, Cl, Br, I, C6H5, andEMI6.2 Such groups represented by the Formulas I and 11 alter the vinyl polymer into a water soluble vinyl polymer having excellent affinity and adsorption ability for semipermeable membranes, particularly for membranes made of cellulose acetate.By adding a semipermeable membrane with an effective amount of a modified vinyl polymer containing an acetoxy group and a group represented by the Formulas I and 11 , the rejection performance of the membrane can be remarkably potentiated, even if the modified vinyl polymer is not insolubi lived. The modification is well achieved by reacting polyvinyl acetate, its copolymers and their partially or fully saponified polymers, with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of dibasic acids, tribasic acids, tetrabasic acids, acid anhydrides thereof and or acid chlorides thereof 0 The more preferred modified vinyl polymers used in the present invention are modified polymers having the group represented by the Formula A or B and are obtained by reac ting a partially saponified vinyl acetate with maleic anhydride or succinic anhydride.The molar fractions a, b and c in the modified vinyl polymer represented by the Formula III should satisfy the aforementioned equations, and should preferably satisfy the following equation 0.8 a 004 0.4 b 0.1 Q.2 c O Wlet the molar fractions aw b and c do not satisfy the above equations, it is not possible to obtain a modified vinyl polymer having good water solubility and excellent capacity for rejuvenating or improving the rejection performance of the membrane.Such modified vinyl polymers can be easily prepared by methods well known in prior art, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent Noe 1,672,195 and JapanesePatent Publication No. 16,150 1965. OzB of the representative methods for preparing the modified vinyl polymers is as follows 1 hydroJysing or saponifying a polyvinyl acetate with aqueous alkali or acid solutions, 2 reacting a partially saponified polyvinyl acetate with various carboxylic acids, for example, a dibasic acid such as succinic acid, maleic acid, phthalic acid, tribasic acids such as propane tricarboxylic acid, trimellitic acid, te tra basic acids such as butane tetracarboxylic acid and pyrromel litic acid, and their acid anhydrides and their acid halides as well Tulle modified vinyl polymers of the present invention may also be obtained by reacting a partially saponified polyvinyl acetate with acrylonitrile or cyan ions and formaldehyde, and then hydrolising the resulting cyan ometiiylated or cyanoethylated polyvinyl acetate. The water solubility of the modified vinyl polymers obtained by reacting tije partially saponified polyvinyl acetate with the carboxylic acids depends on the reaction ratio of the carboxylic acids to the partially saponified vinyl polymers.When tlie reaction ratio of the carboxylic acids to the part icily sapoiiified vinyl acetate is lower, the solubility of tlie modified polymers becomes poor. However, these modified vinyl polymers can be converted to water soluble polymers by controlSing the pH in an aqueous solution by adding alkali hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide, organic amines, etc. By ciiangiiig tlie water solubility pH of the modified vinyl polymers before and after treating the semipermeable membrane, rejection performance and performance durability of the semipermeable membrane can be controlled.But the modified vinyl polymers of the present invention have such good affinity and absorption ability relative to the semipermeable membrane, that the membrane treating effect does not disappear even after long term operation.The content of acetoxy groups contained in the modified vinyl polymers is preferably within the range of about 20 to 90 molar more preferably about 40 to 80 mols relative to the repeating units of the modified vinyl polymer chain. The insolubilization or fixation of the modified vinyl polymers may be achieved by treating various reagents which have reactivity to tlie groups represented by the Formula I . Examples of such rea6reit include multivalent organic amines, etc. Tii membrane treating agent of tile present invention may be awl vied to semipermeable membranes having various shapes such ab films, tubes, or hollow fibers, or Loeb type asymmetric or composite membranes which comprise various organic polymers such as cellulose esters, ployamides, polybenzimidazoles, etc. The membrane treating agents of the present invention give an excellent effect to the semipermeable membrane comprising cellulose esters, partic ularly cellulose acetate.The membrane treating agents of the present invention are employed as either aqueous solutions, organic solvent solutions or dispersions, etc. containing an effective amount of the modified vinyl polymer, However, the membrane treating agents are usually used as aqueous solutions containing about 0.0001 to 1.0 by weight, preferably about 0.0003 to 0.01 by weight of the modified vinyl polymer. The pH of such aqueous solution is preferably about 3 to 9, more preferably about 4 to 8. The addition of surfactant to the aqueous solution may give good effects in somecases. Membrane treating can be achieved by well known methods, for example dipping the membrane into the acqueous solution containing the membrane treating agent, spraying the aqueous solution on the membrane or, more easily, the membrane treating agent may be added to the feed solution during the operation of the reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration procedure.The following examples are illustrative of the invention EXAMPLE 1A modified vinyl polymer was prepared by reacting partially saponified polyvinyl acetate with maleic anllydride as follows 10 grd ms of partially saponified polyvinyl acetate average molecular weight MW 1700, degree of saponification 40 was dissolved in 100 milliliters of dimethylsulfoxide, after which 20 grams of maleic anhydride were added and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. A white polymeric matti i. iI was obtained by mixing the aforementioned solution with 500 milliliters of water.The material was filtered, washed with 1 O milliliters of water and then dried for 24 liUlil b iii a vacuum.This polylller was dissolved in a dilute ammonia water and was stored as a 10 solution having a pH of 7, at a room tempe. ature. The infrared spectra of this polymer showed strong absorption at 1730 cm 1 ester linkage VC O and 1240 cm 1 esteric VC O , and a newsabsorption at 1575cm 1 ionic carboxylate . EXAMPLE 2A cellulose acetate asymmetric reverse osmosis membrane was evaluated under tlie following conditions Feed 3.5 sodium chloride Temperature 25 0C Operating 2 pressure 56 Kg cn Flow Rate lm sec. Initially, tile asymmetric membrane exhibited a salt rejection of 98.7 and a water flux of 0.30m3 m2 day. The modified vinyl polymer obtained in Example 1 was added to a feed solution 3.5 sodium chloride so that the polymer was supplied to tlie membrane at about 100 ppm while the evaluation was continued. After an hour, salt rejection improved to 99.35 and water flux was reduce to 0.25m3 m2 dey.After this tlie feed solution was changed to fresh 3.5 sodiijiii chloride performance improved by the treatment was maintained even after 24 hours test.This effect is illustrated in the drawing. The number 1 designates ills tidal membrane performance, and 4 in the drawing is improved membrane performance after treatment by this eawpi. EXAMPLE 3A modified vinyl polymer was prepared by using succinic anhydride instead of maleic anhydride. The other conditions were the same as Example 1The cellulose acetate asymmetric reverse osmosis membrane before treatment exhibited a salt rejection of 97.27 and a water flux of .36m3 m2 day under the same conditions as Example 2.Membrane treatment was accomplished by adding the modified vinyl polymer to the feed solution at 10 ppm, while the evaluation was continued. After 24 hours the salt rejection 32 improved to 99037 and the water flux was reduced to O.33m m day. This performance did not change after 24 hours operation on a fresh sodium chloride solution. EXAMPLE 4A cellulose acetate asymmetric membrane was immersed in an aqueous solution containing 0.15 of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate for 20 hours at 30 C, in which the pH was 11. By this immersion the membrane performance was reduced by hydrolysis, the salt rejection decreased to 95.0 from 98.0 and the water flux increased to O.70ín3 m day froin 0.60m3 m2 day under the following conditions Feed s 0.25 sodium chloride Temperature 250C Operating 30 pressure 30 ppw of tlie modified vinyl polymer obtained in Example 1 were added to the solution and the evaluation was continued for all bour.Then membrane performance was rejuvenated, and found to eiIibjt a salt rejection of 97.7 and a water flux of 0.60m3 m2 day, wllich was maintained after 24 hours operation using a fresh feed solution.
