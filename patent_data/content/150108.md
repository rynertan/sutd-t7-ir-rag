# Coating process.

## Abstract
Silica may be deposited on metal surfaces eg on heat exchanger surfaces to reduce undesirable deposits by the following aqueous process. Finely divided moist silicic acid of defined particle size is mixed with hot eg at least 98.5 C pure water for not more than 1 hour. The mixture is subjected to depolymerisation by heating at specified pH so as to depolymerise substantially all the silica. The resulting aqueous silica is then passed over the surface to be coated at temperature above 80 C so as to deposit a hard bound silica coating.
