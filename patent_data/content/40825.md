# Phosphated asbestos fibers and the process for preparing same.

## Abstract
There is disclosed chemically modifed chrysotile asbestos fibers, more particularly phosphated asbestos fib ers containing from 0.5 to 5 by weight of phosphate groups and heat treated phosphated asbestos fibers, both of which have an in frared spectrum which exhibits sub stantially no absorption within the range of 954 1080 cm ยน. The novel phosphated asbestos fibers are characterized by reduced haemolytic and cytotoxic activities. The phos phated asbestos fibers are prepared by contacting chry sotile asbestos fibers under dry conditions and agitation with vapors of a phosphorous compound selected from the group consisting of phosphorous oxychloride and phos phorous pentachloride in an atmosphere inert to the phos phorous compound.
