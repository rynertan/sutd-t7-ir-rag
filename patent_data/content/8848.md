# Apparatus for recording optical data onto a movable light sensitive material, including an acousto optic modulator.

## Abstract
An optical data recording system in which a writing beam 41 , such as that generated by a laser 20 , is incident on an acousto optic device 30 such as a Bragg cell and may be diffracted deflected at an angle determined by the frequency of a source applied to the device. By selecting the system mangification between the device and a recording medium 14 such that the magnification is substantially equal to the ratio of the scanning velocity of the writing beam, or the velocity of the recording medium if the writing beam itself does not scan, to the velocity of the sound wave in the acousto optic device, the image of the acoustic pulse follows the surface of the recording medium and permits imaging of the video signal to the recording medium without blurring.
