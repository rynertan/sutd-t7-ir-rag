# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine 10 comprises a cylin der block 12 having a plurality of main bearing bulkheads 20 , and a skirt section 16 . Each bearing bulkhead 20 is formed with throughholes 34 , each of which has an upper end opening to the skirt section 16 and a lower end open ing to the bottom surface of the bearing bulkhead 20 . The bearing bulkhead 20 is formed at its bottom surface with a depression 24 . Each of a plurality of bearing caps is installed to the bearing bulkhead 20 in a manner to fit in the bearing bulkhead depression 20 . Additionally, bolts 30 are disposed respectively in the bearing bulkhead through holes 34 , each bolt having an upper end section located on the skirt section and a lower end section located in the hole 40 formed in the bearing cap, thereby cutting off the excess beef of the bearing cap 26 to sharply reduce the weight of the being cap 26 .
