# Recirculating document feeder.

## Abstract
A document to be copied is inserted into a recirculating document feeder of a moving document copier at an entry station 21 and is edge aligned against a reference surface 55 . The feeder has a loop shaped document path to recircu late a document once for each requested copy after the first. A turn around guide 38 is pivoted into or out of the document path to direct the document into or out of the recirculating path. The reference surface 55 is interrupted in the vicinity of the guide. The guide is so disposed as to skew the leading edge of the document so that it is displaced slightly from the reference surface 55 to avoid document jams. The document is subsequently re aligned against the reference surface 55 for rescanning to make another copy. A copy request counter operates to pivot the guide to the document intercept position so long as more copies are needed. When all requested copies have been imaged, the document is allowed to proceed to an exit tray 40 .
