# Power capacitor structure and method of assembly.

## Abstract
A power capacitor and method of making by stacking capacitor sections together in an enclosure in which each section includes rolled electrode foils and dielectric layers of which at least one of the electrodes has a rolled edge resulting in a greater thickness in that portion of the section. The winding tension is deliberately made loose and the initially resulting section is insufficiently tight to retain conductive tabs reliably in contact with the foil electrodes. The stacked sections have, however, between them in the body portion intermediate the rolled edges, one or more sheets of material that compress the body portion and insure reliable pressure contact thereat while not interfering with the impregnation of the fluid throughout the section.
