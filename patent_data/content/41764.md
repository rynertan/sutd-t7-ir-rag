# Method and apparatus for detecting fluorescence under ambient light conditions.

## Abstract
Fluorescent materials such as certain metal ores are detected under ambient light conditions by observing the material through a gated aperture which is opened at pre determined intervals for periods of predetermined duration while simultaneously exposing the material to periodic pulses of fluorescent stimulating light. The frequency of the light pulse is synchronized with the frequency of the opening of the gated aperture so that the aperture is open for at least a portion of the period during which fluorescence is produced by the stimulating light pulse. Electro optic goggles are a preferred type of gated aperture.
