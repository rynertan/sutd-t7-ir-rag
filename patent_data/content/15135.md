# Process for making heat insulating firebricks.

## Abstract
A process for making heat insulating firebricks from a material containing a refractory aggregate, an inorganic binder and granular foamed polystyrene as a pore making agent in which an addition of a small amount of aluminia cement having an alumina content of from 8 to 75 by weight and a small amount of water soluble styrene maleic resin is made. This addition hardens the mixture to provide an initial green strength allowing the bricks to be demoulded quickly. Preferably the amount of the alumina cement is from 1 to 3 parts by weight of the aggregate and binder and the amount of the water soluble styrene maleic resin is from 0.1 to 0.3 parts by weight of the aggregate and binder.
