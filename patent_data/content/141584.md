# Durable controlled release microcapsules.

## Abstract
Impact resistant microcapsules for the sustained and controlled release of biologically active ingredients through a surrounding permeable polymeric wall are disclosed wherein the ratio by weight of active ingredient to polymer is from about 4 1 to about 1 4, the polymeric walls having high tensile yield and tensile impact strengths and low nitrogen permeabilities.
