# Process and apparatus for removing suspended solids from a liquid.

## Abstract
A novel process for removing suspended solids from a liquid without loss of heel portion comprising circulating a suspension of a precoat filter aid through a closed chamber provided with at least one vertical tubular, liquid pervious filter aid retainer supported on a tube sheet with the lower pervious section level with said tube sheet until a filter cake is formed on said retainer, pumping a liquid with suspended solids through the chamber whereby clear liquid passes through said filter cake into said retainer where clear liquid is recovered and suspended solids are deposited on filter cake, continuing pumping liquid with suspended solids until a maximum differential pressure is reached, reduce the pumping rate of liquid while simultaneously increasing air pressure to a maximum of 15 psig in the chamber, draining liquid from the chamber through the filter cake and retainer while maintaining air pressure of 2 to 15 psig to recover the heel portion, abruptly back washing liquid through the re tainer and filter cake whereby the filter cake is destroyed and draining the mixture of filter cake and back wash liquid from the chamber and a novel apparatus for performing the said process.
