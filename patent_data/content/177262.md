# Baking utensils.

## Abstract
A baking utensil which is designed for use in commercial baking operations has a rigid frame 12 for supporting baking pans 14 . The frame has side walls 16 , end walls 18 and spacing struts 24 forming compartments for the reception of individual pans 14 . The pans themselves have nonstick baking surfaces and each has a circumscribing wire 36 forming the basis for a bead round the edge of the pan which can thus sit snugly in its compartment in a manner which permits ready detachment and replacement. Typically, the pans baking surfaces are coated with PTFE lpolytetra fluoroethylene .
