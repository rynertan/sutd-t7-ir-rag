## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Substituted hexahydro arylquinolizines, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with novel substituted hexahydro arylquinolizines or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are selective a2 adrenoceptor antagonists and are of value in conditions where selective antagonism of the a2 adrenoceptor is desirable for example as antidepressant, antihypertensive, ocular antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antiobesity agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors, and modifiers of gastrointestinal motility. It also relates to processes for preparing the novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds and to a method of antagonizing a2 adrenoceptors. The concept that the complex clinical state of depression is linked to a functional deficiency of monoamines in the central nervous system is now widely accepted. Numerous biochemical and clinical observations support the proposal that many forms of depressive illness are associated with reductions in adrenergic activity at functionally important sites in the brain. Thus, classical antidepressive drugs, such as amitriptyline and imipramine, are believed to act by blocking the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and or serotonin, thereby enhancing the availability of the monoamines as neurotransmitters. In addition to al adrenergic receptors which mediate postsynaptic responses to the neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, other adrenergic receptors are present at or near sympathetic terminals. These latter receptors, a2 adrenergic receptors, form part of a negative feedback system which modulates noradrenergic neurotransmission by controlling the impulse induced release of norepinephrine from presynaptic terminals.Activation of a2 adrenergic receptors results in a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine normally released from the nerve terminals by nerve impulses while antagonism of a2 adrenergic receptors increases norepinephrine release. Therefore, molecules that block a2 adrenergic receptors afford an alternate approach to enhancement of noradrenergic function and the treatment of depression associated with an absolute or relative deficiency of adrenergic function. a2 Adrenergic receptor antagonism is also associated with antidiabetic, antihypertensive, ocular antihypertensive, antiobesity, platelet aggregation inhibition activity, and modification of gastrointestinal motility. Compounds structurally related to the novel compounds of this invention are disclosed in BritishPatents 1,435,573 and 2,106,909 of John Wyeth andBrother, Ltd.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with a compound of structural formula I EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof, whereinAr represents an aromatic heterocvcle such as EMI3.2 pyridino benzofuro thiazolo benzoEMI3.3 imidazo pyrazolo benzothieno thieno furo RÚ and R2 are independently, 1 hydrogen, 2 halo, such as chloro, bromo, or fluoro, 3 hydroxy, 4 C1 3 alkoxy, or 5 C1 6alkyl, either straight or branched chain B represents a spiroheterocycle of 4 7 members with up to 2 heteroatoms one of which is bonded to the spiro carbon and if Ar is benzo that heteroatom is nitrogen wherein the members are independently CH2 ,EMI4.1 0 , NR3 or SO2 such as, l spiro 4 imidazolidin 2one, 2 spiro 4 imidazolidin 2 thione, 3 spiro 3 1,2,5 thiadiazol idin l, l dioxide , 4 spiro 5pyrazolidin 3 one, 5 spiro 5 pyrrolidin 2 one, 6 spiro 5 tetrahydrofuran 2 one, 7 spiro 5oxazolidin 2 one, 8 spiro 4 oxazolidin 2 one, 9 spiro 3 isoxazolidin 5 one, 10 spiro 4 imidazolidin 2,5 dionem, 11 spiro 4 azetiditin 2 one, 12 spiro 4 5,6 dihydro 1H pyrimidin 2 3H9 one , 13 spiro 4 1,3 diazin 2,6 dione , 14 spiro 4 3,4,5,6 tetrahydro 1,3 oxazin 2 one , 15 spiro 5 2,4,5,6 tetrahydro l,4 oxazin 3 one , 16 spiro 5piperazin 2,3 dione, 17 spiro 5 piperazin 3 one, or 18 spiro 5 1,4 diazepin 7 one .R3 is 1 hydrogen, 2 EMI4.2 wherein R is hydrogen or C1 3 alkyl, 3 C1 6 alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a hydroxy, b carboxy, c C1 3alkoxycarbonyl, d halo such as fluoro, chloro or bromo, e C1 3alkoxy, f CoNR6R7 wherein R and R7 are the same or different and are hydrogen or C1 5alkyl or joined together either directly to form a 5 7 membered ring such as pyrrolidino, or piperidino, or through a heteroatom selected from N, 0, and S, form a 6 membered heterocycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as morpholino, piperazino, N C1 3 alkylpiperazino, g NR6R7,EMI5.1 i SO2NR6R7 or j SO2 C1 3alkyl R5 is 1 hydrogen, 2 C1 6 alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a oR8, wherein R8 is i H, or ii C1 6alkyl, b N R8 COR8, or c CO2R8, 3 CO2R8, or 4 CONR6R7. The spiro partial structures represented asB in Compound I, have the following structures EMI6.1 The pharmaceutically acceptable salts coming within the purview of this invention include the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.Acids useful for preparing these acid addition salts include, inter alia, inorganic acids, such as the hydrohalic acids e.g., hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid , sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as maleic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, acetic, benzoic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, salicylic, succinic, theophylline, 8 chlorotheophylline, p aminobenzoic, p acetamidobenzoic, methanesulfonic, or ethanedisulfonic acid. In a preferred embodiment of this invention,Ar is RlR2 benzolb furo R1,R2 benzo b thieno , thieno , furo or benzo and B is a spiro 4imidazolidin 2 one or spiro 4 5,6 dihydro lH pyrimidin 2 3H one . It is further preferred thatR1 and R2 be hydrogen or halo and R3 be C16alkyl, especially methyl. It is also preferred that R5 be hydrogen or C16 alkyl. It is most preferred that R1 and R2 be hydrogen, R3 be methyl, and R5 be hydrogen. The novel compounds of this invention are described herein as having the configuration in which the heteroatom in ring B attached to carbon 2 and the hydrogen at 12b are trans ,EMI7.1 and it is the more preferred isomer for a2 adrenoceptor blockade activity. However, the isomers in which the heteroatom in ring B attached to carbon 2 and the hydrogen at 12b are cis are also active a2 adrenoceptor blockers and are considered to be within the scope of this invention. Each of these configurational isomers are racemates capable of being resolved into dextrorotatory and levorotatory enantiomers. This invention includes these pure enantiomers as well as all mixtures thereof, especially the racemates. Another embodiment of this invention are the novel processes used to prepared the novel compounds. For those compounds wherein the spiroheterocycle, B, includes a carbonyl or thiocarbonyl flanked on both sides by a heteroatom independently selected from oxygen and nitrogen, i.e.wherein B is an imidazolidin 2 one, or thione, oxazolidin 2 one or thione, or dihydro pyrimidin 2one or thione, or 2,6 dione a preferred process is to treat the 2,2 disubstituted quinolizine with carbonyldiimidazole or thiocarbonyldiimidazole as represented by the following EMI8.1 The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, methylene dichloride, or the like or mixtures thereof at about 10 to 500C. The temperature is not critical and the reaction is most readily conducted at room temperature. Reaction times of about 1 to about 10 hours are sufficient to complete the reaction, but longer times are not deleterious. As an alternative to the carbonyl diimidazole and thiocarbonyldiimidazole there may be employed phosgene or thiophosgene respectively. Similarly for those novel compounds wherein the spiroheterocycle includes a sulfonyl flanked on both sides by an oxygen or nitrogen such as a thiadiazolidin l,l dioxide, a 2,2 disubstituted quinolizine is treated with sulfuryl chloride as represented by the following EMI9.1 This reaction is best conducted in an inert atmosphere and solvent such as chloroform, methylene dichloride, benzene, toluene or the like at about 10 to 100C, and preferably about OOC for about 1 to 8 hours followed by spontaneous warming to room temperature or about 200C. Another ring forming reaction useful for preparing the novel compounds of this invention comprises treating a quinolizin 2 one with a mixture of an organometallic such as n butyl lithium and allyl bis dimethylamino phosphonate in an ethereal solvent such as THF, diethyl ether or 1,2 dimethoxyethane at about 50 to 200C followed by spontaneous warming to room temperature over about 2 to 5 hours. The reaction is depicted as follows EMI10.1 Spiro imidazolidin diones are prepared from 2 amino 2 alkoxycarbonylguinolizines by treatment with alkyl isocyanates depicted as follows EMI10.2 The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxane, chloroform, or the like preferably at about room temperature, although temperature is not critical, for about 12 to 24 hours. Spiro pyrazolidin ones are prepared by treating a 2 alkoxycarbonylmethylenylquinolizine with hydrazine in an inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene or the like at about 65 1000C for about 0.5 to 3 hours. The reaction is as shown below EMI11.1 Similarly, using methylhydrazine in refluxing THF for about 18 to 48 hours there is produced the corresponding 2 methylpyrazolidin 3 one. The same ester starting material with ethylenediamine in a lower alkanol such as methanol at about room temperature for about 20 60 hours provides a spiro 5 1,4 diazepin 7 one . The same ester starting material is useful in the synthesis of spiro isoxazolidin 5 ones by treatment with N alkyl hydroxylamine and an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium or sodium carbonate in an inert organic solvent such as THF, diethyl ether, or the like at about reflux temperature 30 500C for about 12 to 48 hours. Treatment of a 2 amino 2 aminomethylquinolizine with diethyloxalate results in the formation of a spiro piperazine 2,3 dione. The reaction is conducted in the same manner as that described for synthesis of the imidazolidinones. Treatment of a 2 chloroacetoxymethyl2 chloroacetylamino quinolizine with a mixture of finely divided potassium hydroxide and neutral alumina suspended in an inert organic solvent such as benzene or toluene at about ambient temperatures for about 1 to 4 hours provides a spiro 1,4 oxazin 3 one, as shown below EMI12.1 In a similar reaction a 2 trifluoroacetylaminomethyl 2 chloroacetylaminoquinolizine is treated with potassium hydroxide pellets in a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol at ambient temperature for about 1 to 4 hours to yield a spiro piperazin3 one. Another spirocycle of this invention is the 4 membered azetidinone and it is readily prepared by treating a spiro isoxazolidin 5 one with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst at a slightly elevated pressure of about 20 to 80 psig. at or near room temperature in a lower alkanol solvent for about 12 to 24 hours, or until the requisite amount of hydrogen is absorbed. The resulting amino acid is cyclized by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC . The ring size reduction is depicted as follows EMI13.1 Any of the spiro heterocycles with a secondary amino group as a member of the ring may be alkylated, or benzylated, or acylated by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In the novel method of this invention of selectively antagonizing a2 adrenergic receptors in a patient, a novel compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg per kg of body weight per day in a single dose or in 2 to 4 divided doses. The novel compounds of this invention can be administered as the sole active ingredient or in combination with other antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine or other norepinephrine or serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. These doses are useful for treating depression, diabetes, hypertension, ocular hypertension, abnormal platelet aggregation, obesity and abnormal gastrointestinal motility. The compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of the present invention, in the described dosages, are administered orally, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, transdermally or intravenously. They are preferably administered orally, for example in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gum, or the like prepared by art recognized procedures. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
