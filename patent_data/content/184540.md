# Process for removing electrolyte vapor from fuel cell exhaust gas.

## Abstract
Electrolyte vapor entrained in the hot exhaust gas stream from a fuel cell 12, 24 is removed by passing the gas stream through a saturator 18 , over high surface area material, in direct contact with water circulating in a loop 22 which also passes through the saturator 18 . The hot gas stream evaporates a small portion of the water, resulting in cooling of the gas stream and condensing of electrolyte therein as it cools, The electrolyte dissolves into the recircu lating water. The water is exchanged at predetermined invervals or when the concentration of electrolyte reaches a predetermined level. At least 99 of the electrolyte can be removed from the gas stream in this manner.
