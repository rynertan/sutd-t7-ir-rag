# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING SURFACTANTS FROM LIQUID USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CONCENTRATED FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSIONS

## Abstract
A process for separating the ammonium salt of a selected fluoroalkanoic acid and a selected hydrocarbyl oxyethoxylatedpolyether from aqueous dross liquor which comprises A. extracting the ammonium salt in the form of its corresponding acid and the ethoxylated compound from an acidified aqueous dross liquor by agitating with a selected organic liquid and separating the organic liquid layer, B.1 contacting said organic liquid layer with activated alumina, 2 washing and drying the alumina and contacting it with ammonium hydroxide, C. boiling the organic liquid obtained in step B1 until the ethoxylated compound remains.
