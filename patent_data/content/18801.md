# Rotary electrical machines.

## Abstract
In a rotary electrical machine 10 , the stator 24 is generally flat, and is built up from copper conductors, bonded together to be self supporting, without any iron. The flux through the stator passes from pole bodies 16 , through the stator, to pole bodies 18 , the pole bodies 16, 18 both forming part of the rotor of the machine.
