# Method of preparing a hydrogen absorbing alloy.

## Abstract
Alloys consisting from 64 to 77 at of manganese, re mainder zirconium, are not suitable without further measures as a material for storing hydrogen at technically desired pres sures. This property can be advantageously influenced by a heat treatment until a homogeneous C14 type of Laves phase has been obtained.
