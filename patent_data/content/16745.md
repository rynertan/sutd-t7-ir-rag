# Process for preparing crumb products.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacturing of crumb products comprising preparation of a first raw material flow F1 containing components or part flows f1 f4, whereof f2 and f4 are optional but preferably present, of which f1 contains liquid milk or milk products such as com pletely or partly defatted fresh milk, defatted or whole condensed milk, whey, completely or partly desalted whey, butter milk, casein or caseinate, whey protein concentrate or combinations thereof, at a dry solids content of 20 70 by weight, especially 30 45 by weight, suitably at a tempera ture of about 50 C f2 contains sugar raw materials in the form of tetroses, pentoses, hexoses such as glucose, fructose, galactose, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, dextromaltose, partially hydrolyzed starch, syrup products, xylitol or different combinations thereof, suitably in an aqueous solution f3 contains dry protein raw materials such as vegetable protein, dry milk solids, whey powder, butter milk powder, which suitably are admixed with water and treated in a colloid mill, at the same dry solids contents as stated for f1 f4 contains one or more amino acids, preferably in combination with one or more reducing sugars. suitably in an aqueous solution and a second flow F2 consisting of part flows f5 and optionally f6, of which f5 contains fatty components in the form of cream, suitably with a fat content of 12 35 ,by weight, butter, butter oil, vegetable and or animal fat products or fat containing products or mixtures thereof f6 consists of an emulsifier for the fat phase, which promotes the formation of emulsions of the type oil in water, e.g. glyceryl monostearate and that the flow F1 at a dry solids content of 20 70 by weight and a pH in the range 4 8, preferably 6.5 7.5, is heat treated at a temperature of 100 130 C during a period of time of about 7 2 minutes for performing a Maillard reaction, and subsequently is cooled to a temperature of suitably 80 95 C whereupon the flows F1 at the said temperature and F2 suitably at a temperature of 65 75 C are metered into an emulsifying vessel to the formation of an emulsion of F2 in F1, which emulsion after an optional adjustment of the water content is submitted to a homogenizing treatment in a homogenizer, whereupon the crumb emulsion formed is either used directly or dried to the formation of a powder which optionally can be submitted to a further heat treatment such as in a fluidized bed for a completing Maillard reaction, further drying to a water content of suitable 1.5 6 by weight, especially 2 3.5 by weight, and sieving for obtaining a desired fraction.
