# LOCKING MECHANISM FOR PILOT OPERATED VALVE

## Abstract
A locking mechanism for a valve of the type having a slide or spool 12 longitudinally shiftable to two operative positions by a valve shift control such as a pilot operator 32 71 is provided. The locking mechanism includes a lock pin 72 having a tapered end 74 which may be biased to a projecting position or released by a lock control assembly 72A, 72B and 72C . When released by the lock control, the pin may be forced to the retracted, or non locking, position thereof by the contact of the slide with the tapered end of the lock pin under the urging of the valve shift control minimiz ing or eliminating the need for separate lock pin retraction mechanisms.
