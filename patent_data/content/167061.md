# VECTOR PROCESSING COMPUTER

## Abstract
A vector processing computer 20 includes a memory control unit 22 , main memory 99 , a central processor 156 , a service processing unit 42 and a plurality of input output processors 54, 68 . The central processor 156 includes a physical cache unit 100 , an address translation unit 118 , an instruction processing unit 126 , an address scalar unit 142 , a vector control unit 144 , an odd pipe vector processing unit 148 and an even pipe vector processing unit 150 . The computer 20 is configured to operate in a pipelined fashion wherein each of the functional units is essentially independent and is designed to carry out its operational function in the fastest possible manner. Vector elements are transmitted from memory, either main memory 99 , a physical cache unit 100 or a logical cache 326 through a source bus 114 where the elements are alternately loaded into the vector processing units 148, 150 . The vector control unit 144 decodes the vector instructions and generates the required control commands for operating the registers and logical units within the vector processing units 148, 150 . Thus, the vector processing units 148, 150 essentially work in parallel to double the processing rate. The resulting vectors are transmitted through a destination bus 114 to either the physical cache unit 100 , the main memory 99 , the logical cache 326 or to an input output processor 54 . In a further aspect of the computer 20 there is produced an entry microword from a store 350 for the immediate execution of the first microinstruction within a sequence of microinstructions. The remaining microinstruc tions are produced from a conventional store 376 . This reduces the delay in the retrieval and execution of the first microinstruction. In a still further aspect of the computer 20 there is included the logical data cache 326 which stores data at logical addresses such that the central processor 156 can store and retrieve data without the necessity of first making a translation from logical to physical address.
