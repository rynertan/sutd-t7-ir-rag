# BASE CLOTH FOR REINFORCEMENT

## Abstract
The present invention provides a base cloth for rein forcement produced by winding a weldable yarn on either one of a warp or weft or the both at a definite interval, arranging the warp and weft in the respective directions and then thermally welding the both yarns. According to this method, the fraying of warp or weft, particularly easy fluffing of carbon fibers, etc. can be prevented by winding the weldable yarn. And, it is sufficient for the weldable yarn to be present at the intersections between the warp and weft. Consequently, as compared with a case wherein the whole weft is impregnated with adhesives, penetration of the matrix resin can sufficiently be attained and thus, strength in the weft direction can be improved.
