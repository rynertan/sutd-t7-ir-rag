## Description
COMPOSITE PRODUCTS FROM LIGNOCELLULOSIC MATERIALS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process of converting lignocellulosic materials into composite products. This invention particularly relates to a process of converting lignocellulosic materials into composite products such as panel products, reconstituted lumber and moulded articles, without the use of any adhesive binders which are an essential part of the conventional dry process of manufacturing composite products, such as wood based particle board, waferboard and medium density fibreboard, etc. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn my United States patent application serial no. 480,570 there is disclosed a process for making composite products from sugarcontaining lignocellulosic materials, specifically of annual plants of non woody nature, such as sugarcane bagasse, stalks of corn, sorghum, sunflower, and flax, etc., without the addition of adhesive binders. The free sugars within the lignocellulosic materials, which are water soluble, are chemically transformed, in situ, by the application of heat and pressure into an insoluble and infusible polymeric substance, acting as both a bonding and bulking agent, to strengthen the reconstituted composite products with strong mechanical strength and superb dimensional stability.It is believed that the free sugars, carbohydrates or saccharides, and water soluble materials are chemically transformed into furfural and other derivatives, and further thermoset under heat and pressure to form a bond during the hot moulding operation. Thus produced, the bond binds, bulks and strengthens the lignocellulosic materials into reconstituted composite products with good mechanical strength and superb dimensional stability.However, this patented process is limited to lignocellulosic materials containing free sugars only and is not applicable to lignocellulosic materials containing no free sugars, such as wood, cereal straws, rice husks, reeds, etc. The conventional process for making composite panel products from these lignocellulosic materials relies exclusively on synthetic resin binders for bonding. Since synthetic resins, such as phenol . and urea formaldehyde, are expensive, they normally constitute a large portion of production cost for the conventional panel products, such as particleboard, waferboard and medium density fibreboard. This is especially true in the case of agricultural residues.Because of their physical nature, a relatively high content of resin binders is required for manufacturing, thus resulting in an expensive panel product. This is one of the major reasons why agricultural residues are not widely utilized today in the manufacturing of panel products, in spite of the abundance and availability of the raw materials. Th recent years a number of lanufacturing processes have been developed to utilize agricultural residues as raw material for the production of panel products, for example rice husks, one of the most abundant yet the least utilized agricultural residues around the world. However,none of those processes so far developed has found commercial acceptance. Thus E. C. Lathrop et al.in Hardboard frii agricultural residues , Modern Plastics, 126 April 1951 reported the use of a combination of powdered thermosetting phenolic resin, pine gum and ground rice husks to make composite panel products. He found that boards by using as much as 15 percent phenolic resin were too brittle to be nailed. Moreover, the boards had a density of 1.12 69.9 Ibis. per cubic foot . This combination of 15 percent powdered resin and high density makes the product too expensive to compete with currently available products, and the brittleness of the board places a severe limitation to its use. The use of a specially fointlated phenolic resin for bonding rice husks has been reported by R. C. v3sisshth in the U. S. Patent No. 3,850,677 datedNow. 26, 1974. Rice husks boards can be made with 8 to 10 percent of a water irrmisciable, caustic free, thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin and pretreated rice husks. In his process, the pretreatment is essential because it breaks up rice husk pods into individual leaves, removes loosely bonded surface materials, and screens out fine particles. It is claimed that the inclusion of fine materials generated from the pretreatment would not only increase the resin consumption, but also introduce some undesirable effects on board property. More recently, there was a publication New opportunities in manufacturing conventional particleboard using isocyanate binders reported by G. W.Ball Proceedings Washington State University Particleboard Symposium. No.15, P 266 285, 1981 . Rice husks board was made with pretreated rice husks, using 9 percent of very expensive polymeric isocyanate resins as a bonding agent. Since isocyanate resins are more expensive than the conventional phenolic resin, the production cost of rice husks boards must be very high.This makes rice husks board too expensive to compete with the conventional wood besed panel products. Presently, the conventional manufacturing of panel products from lignocellulosic materials relies exclusively upon synthetic resin for bonding.Synthetic resin binders are expensive because they are derived from petrochemicals. In general resin cost constitutes a major portion of production cost for panel products. Resin cost has been reported as high as 60 percent of production cost for panel products from agricultural residues . Therefore, in view of resin cost and raw material selection,a process that eliminates synthetic resin for manufacturing of composite products and uses any lignocellulosic materials would be very attractive. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a novel process Wh39ty reconstituted composite products, such as panel boards, composite lumber, moulded articles and the like, can be produced from lignocellulosic materials without the use of synthetic resin binders. This new process is applinshle to all lignocellulosic materials, regardless of origin, species, source, form, and shape.Such lignocellulosic materials can be any vegetations, particularly the residues from forestry and agricultural crops, in the forra of trunk, bark, stalk, root, foliage, shell, pod, straw, husk, nut, etc. they nay be used singularly or in combination with other lignocellulosic materials to form reconsitituted composite products without using the synthetic resin binders, such as urea and phenol formaldehyde resin commonly being employed in the conventional manufacturing of wood based panel products. I have dis ered that free sugars can be generated from hemicellulose in any lignocellulosic materials and utilized as a bonding agent for reconstituted composite products, thus eliminating the use of synthetic resin bindersIt is well kmown that lignocellulosic materials comprise three main components cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Chemically, cellulose,which is the main structural component of all plant cell walls and which constitutes about 40 to 60 percent of lignocellulosic materials, is a linear polysaccharide built up from anhydro glucose units having the general formula C6 H10 O5 n.Cellulose is crystalline in nature. Hemicellulose is the narrre given to non cellulosic low molecular weight polysaccarides, associated in plant tissues with cellulose in the lignocel lulosic materials. 11 ticellulose ,which constitutes about 20 to 35 percent of the lignocellulosic materials,may be repeated by the general formula C5 H8 O4 nl C6 H10 O5 n2, representing 5 and 6 carbon sugars, such as pentosan and hexosan. The third main component is lignin which occurs in 20 to 30 percent of the lignocellulosic materials. The precursors of lignin and its formation in lignocellulosic materials are still not completely elucidated, although re cently ,considerable progress has been trade. Today lignin is generally accepted to be a polymeric material made up of phenylpropane units. Since hemicellulose is in situ largely amorphous in character, it has great accessibility to water. Thus, hemicellulose is decomposed about 100 tines faster than cellulose, and hence hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed selec tively without the degradation of cellulose. The general hydrolysis reaction is C5 H8 nl C6 10 O5 n2 n1 n2 H20 n1 C5 H10 05 n C6 H12 O yielding 5 and 6 carbon sugars.These free sugars are reactive and can be decomposed under heat into furfural and other decomposition products, w hich can be further transformed into a polymeric substance to provide a bonding and bulking effect on lignocellulosic materials by the application of heat and pressure in a moulding operation, resulting in reconstituted composite products with good mechanical strength and excellent dimensional stability. PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION This invention process comprises two major parts of operation. The first part is to decompose and hydrolyze the hemicellulose portion of the lignocellulosic materials and convert it into free sugars, carbohydrates, or monosaccharide ,such as xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, etc. The second part of the process is to chemically transform and thermoset the free sugars, in situ, into a polymerized substance, compounding the lignocellulosic materials into a reconstituted composite products. It has been found that since hemicellulose can be selectively decomposed and hydrolyzed at a much faster rate than cellulose, it is possible to convert only the hemicellulose into free sugars for bonding without destroying the cellulose. To achieve this, a high pressure steam treating method or so called auto hydrolysis has been discovered to be very satisfactory for the invention.During high pressure steaming of lignocellulosic materials, hemicellulose would first undergo decomposition reaction. First, acetic acid is formed by cleavage of acetyl side chains, and the weak acidic environment thus created is sufficient to promote hydrolysis of hemicellulose. The depolymerization reaction is believed to be a sequential reaction. During the initial phase of the reaction process, random attack by acid in hemicellulose chains produces oligomers of varying degrees of polymerization. The oligomers are further hydrolyzed to monomers which are further degraded to furfural and other decomposition products Simultaneously, the lignin portion of lignocellulosic materials is also decomposed and hydrolyzed to low weight lignin and lignin products. Only the cellulose remains relatively unchanged.The steam treated lignocellulosic materials normally have about 10 to 30 percent of water solubles which contain sugars, sugar polymers, dehydrated carbohydrates, furfural products, lignin and lignin products. The free sugars, furfural, and other decomposition products are essential parts of the present invention. When chemically transformed under heat and pressure, they thenmset and crosslink into a polyieric substance acting as both a bonding and bulking agent for the reconstituted composite products from the steam treated lignocellulosic materials. The conventional process for making panel products from lignocellulosic materials requires an amount of 8 to 12 percent by weight of synthetic resin binder. Since hemicellulose normally constitutes about 20 to 35 percent of lignocellulosic materials, there is enough basic matter to generate free sugars for bonding. The amount of free sugars which can be generated from the lignocellulosic materials is mainly dependant upon the nature of the raw materials and the degree of steaming treatment. Normally, agricultural residues and hardwood contain more hemicellulose than coniferous softwood. In order to optimize the conversion of hemicellulose into free sugars, a proper control of the high pressure steaming treatment is an important part of the present invention. Oversteaming would not only cause carbonization of the treated material but also lose some of the free sugars and the furfural products in particular. Experimental work on rice husks which contain about 20.4 percent hemicellulose as determined by pentosan analysis indicated that by the nation of steam temperature, or steam pressure, and steaming time, 70 to 80 percent of the hemicellulose can be converted into pentose sugars and furfural products. The accompaning drawing demonstrates the time steam temperature required to obtain the maximum of free sugars and furfural products.The inverse relation ship between tirre and steam temperature is clearly shown The higher the temperature used, the shorter the time required, and vice versa. To a lesser extent, moisture content, shape and size of the lignocellulosic materials also have some effect on maximization of the free sugars. At the end of the steaming treatment, the lignocellulosic material can be collected either by a sudden release or by a gradual release of steam pressure from the pressure vessel. The sudden release of high pressure steam would explode and shred the treated material into a fibrous lump with high moisture content. The slow and gradual release of steam pressure enables the treated material to retain, more or less, its original shape and size.In contrast to the batch system of treating the lignocellulosic material, it is also practical to use a continuous process to steam treat the raw material.This process can be easily adopted to a continuous digester or vessel in which the lignocellulosic material is constantly under the steam pressure, and is fed and extruded continuously from the digester. The material thus treated by the high temperature steam is light to dark brown in colour and has a moisture content from about 40 to more than 100 percent, depending on the initial moisture content of the lignocellulosic material and the severity of hydrolysis. The water in the treated material is also light to dark brown in colour and contains mostly sugars, lignin and a small amount of furfural products. The treated lignocellulosic materials should be dried inmediately to a low moisture content of less than 18 percent. Otherwise, the sugars in the treated lignocellulosic material would start fermention particularly in a humid and warm environment. If fermentation takes place, all free sugars would be transformed to alco lol and acetic acid. Once this happens, the treated lignocellulosic material would not be acceptable for making composite products because there are no free sugars remaining to provide the bonding effect. Here the first part of the present invention ends A dried lignocellulosic material containing a high proportion of free sugars is ready for the manu facturing of reconstituted composite products. me second part of the present invention begins. In the for of individual fibres, particles, strands, flakes1 or in a fori of lumps, chunks, bundles and aggregates, the dried lignocellulosic materials are formed singularly or in combination with other lignocellulosic materials into a desired mat, and then moulded under heat and pressure for a sufficient time to consolidate the mat into a rigid article.The moulding temperature can be in the range of 160 to 250 C, preferably in the range of 200 to 220 C. The e press time is dependent on press temperature and oat dinension, while the pressure is mainly the function of density of the moulded article desired. During the hot moulding operation, the sugars, furfural products and other decomposition products will polymerize and bond in situ the lignocellulosic material to produce a rigid article. In addition, the sugars, which penrx3ate within the cell wall tissue of the lignocellulosic material, will also be transformed and therooset to a polymeric substance, acting as a bulking agent throughout the entire moulded article. Thus, the moulded articles possess excellent mechanical strength and superb dimensional stability with a thermoset adhesive bond which is resistant to boiling water and acid hydrolysis.Furthermore, the composite products thus manufactured are free from the toxic formaldehyde emission because conventional synthetic resin binders are not used. Another important feature of this invention is the discovery of destruction of epidjeeris in agricultural residues such as rice husks, sugar cane bagasse, cereal straws, etc. by the steaming treatment, particularly when corn bined with a sudden release of steam pressure at the end of the steaming treatment. Because of the waxy material of the epidermis which is impervious to water and hence the adhesive bond, the elimination of epidermis would enhance the interface bonding between individual elements. Yet another unique feature of my invention is the discovery of the extra benefits from the destruction and conversion of hemicellulose. As stated, in natural condition, hemicellulose is largely amorphous in character and has great accessibility to water, making lignocellulosic materials highly hygroscopic, and resulting in dimensional changes. Since the treated lignocellulosic materials are almost completely free from hemicellulose, in accordance with my invention the reconstituted composite products would be far less hygroscopic, and hence have better dimensional stability. Embodiment of the invention will be described and illustrated in detail in the following examples Example 1. Rice Husk Boards This example shows the effect of steaming time and steam temperature on rice husk board. Seven batches of rice husks were treated to various steaming conditions. Dry rice husks with 8 moisture content were first packed in the pressure vessel and the vessel was rapidly filled with high pressure steam to heat up the rice husks to a desired temperature for a predetermined time. At the end of steaming, the steam pressure was suddenly released and the rice husks were extracted from the vessel in a hot, moist and fibrous condition.The moisture content of the steamed rice husks varied from about 40 to 60 . A total of 7 batches was treated with different temperatures from 190 to 260 C and times from 15 seconds to 10 minutes .
