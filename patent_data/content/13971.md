# Means for sensing and color multiplexing optical data over a compact fiber optical transmission system.

## Abstract
Optical sensor apparatus and associated means by which to color muitiplex optically encoded information signals over a compact fiber optic transmission system. The sensor apparatus includes a movable coded masking means. The masking means is fabricated with a plurality of parallel rows, each of which rows comprising a binary weighted pattern of alternately spaced transparent and opaque areas. Incident white light is spectrally dispersed, so that each of the rows of the masking means receives a respective color. As the masking means is moved in res ponse to an input physical parameter that is to be sensed, the corresponding binary coded output color signals that are transmitted through the transparent areas of the mas king means are recombined and multiplexed over either a single optical fiber or a bundle of incoherent optical fibers. After demultiplexing or spectral dispersion of the multi plexed output signal, a photo detector means is utilized to receive the individual demultiplexed binary coded output color signals and to provide a numerical equivalent of the position of the masking means and, accordingly, the physi cal parameter represented thereby.
