# Laminar electrical heaters.

## Abstract
Laminar heaters comprise a laminar heating element 5 sandwiched between two laminar electrodes 1, 3 having sub stantial electrical resistance along the thickness thereof. The heater has a heating area of irregular shape, and at least one of the electrodes extends over a connection area in which heat is not generated but which provides a shorter and or more uniform current path to the heatgenerating parts of the heater.
