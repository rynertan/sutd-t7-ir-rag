# Method and apparatus for controlling alignment and brightness of an electron beam.

## Abstract
An electron beam 12 is aligned with the center of an aperture 14 in a plate 16 in the path of the beam by cycli cally scanning 34, 38, 30 the beam across the aperture thro ugh equal distances on opposite sides of an initial beam location, measuring 48 62 the beam current that flows thro ugh the aperture when the beam is on opposite sides of the initial location, which opposite sides correspond to adjacent half cycles of the scan, determining the difference in beam currents flowing in adjacent half cycles, and deflecting 34, 38, 30 the beam in a direction toward the center of the aperture until there is reached a condition wherein the different in currents is zero, which condition indicates that the beam is aligned with the center of the aperture. The currents may be measured by converting them 48, 50 to signals having a frequency proportional to the current, counting 54 62 the signal cycles during each half cycle, and then subtracting 3 the count for one half cycle from that of an adjacent half cycle. The amplitude of the scan is large enough such that the beam strikes the opposite edges of the aperture at the extreme limits of each scan. The scan frequency is preferably that of the power line frequency to eliminate noise problems. The total current flowing through the aperture during a complete scan cycle is also sensed 73 and used to regulate the brightness of the electron beam.
