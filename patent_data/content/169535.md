# Analog to digital converter.

## Abstract
An improved analog to digital converter suitable for fabrication on an integrated circuit and operable at high speed is disclosed. The converter is of the type that a voltage generated by a built in D A converter is successively subtracted from an input analog signal and the digital code of the built in D A converter is derived as the digital output when the coinci dence between the voltage generated by the D A converter and the input analog signal is detected by a comparator. The output of the comparator is fed back to be superposed on the subtracted result as well as being used to control the D A converter.
