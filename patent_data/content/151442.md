## Description
Operating device for developers of photographic materialThe invention concerns the developers of photographic materials like conventional films and disc film and particularly refers to the operating device for rota tion of the supports of the said material into the tanks of these developers, which contain the different chemical baths, and into the last drying chamber. As already known, developers are provided which substantially comprise a plurality of tanks into which the specific supports for the photographic materials are successively disposed and transferred, which sup ports are generally constituted by drums on v hich the conventional films are wound as well as by mandrels on which the disc films are arranged.Every tank is normally provided with a hydraulic circuit having a pump, for keeping in circulation the liquid chemical reagents.In addition, every tank is also provided with a powered system to rotate the drums or the film holder mandrels around the relative supports. so as to ensure an uniform development of the films.This solution is not very retional and cheaper, since every tank requires mechanical devices generally constituted by gear trains with geared motor which complicate the developer construction and maintenance and also involve an excessive energy consumption,It would be desirable, and forms the scope of the invention, to simplify such developers and to utilize advantageously the devices which must be necessarily applied on the same developers,This scope is obtained in a developer for the development of photographic material, which comprises a plu rality cf tanks containing the liquid chemical reagents and which are provided with a circuit having a pump for the reagent circulation, the rotating supports for the photographic material being insertable and transferable within the said tanks.According to the invention, the developer is characterized in that the supports for the photographic material are associated with a rotor, which is able to be rotated by means of a flowing jet coming fror a nozzle placed in front of the said rotor and installed at the end portion of the return pipe of the reagent circulation circuit, which pipe is connected to the tank.Besides, in order to permit the rctational speed of the supports of the photographic material to be varied the circuit for the reagent circulation in every tank comprises an adjustment valve, which is disposed downstreat of the circulation pump and upstream of the net for ope rating the said rotor.These and other features of the invention will result apparent from the following description, by wag of an exemplifying and not limiting scope, with reference to the enclosed drawing in which Fig. 1 shows a schematic perspective view of a part of a developer provided with the device according to the present invention Fig. 2 shows a schematic perspective view of a further part of the developer of Fig. 1.Two tanks 5,6 of a developer are schematically represented in Fig. 1, each of them being provide with a hydraulic circuit which comprises a pump 7 heving a suction ripe 8 and a deliver pipe 9. The liquid chemical reagents for the developrent of the photographic films are circulated within the tanks 5,5 and the maximum reagent level within the tanks is controlled by means of an overflow pipe 10.In the inside of the tanks 5,6 the supports for the films are arranged. which are generally constituted by longitudinal rods 11 having end portions which are inserted into suitable seats which are provided on the edges of the tanks, so as to be easily insertable the rein and extractable therefrom.Adequate plates 12 which may be slided for their regu lation are inserted on the rods 11, on which plates a drum 13 for the conventional films or a mandrel 14 for the disc films are respectively engaged.According to the main feature of the invention, the drum 13 and the mandrel 14 are carrying a relative ro tor 15, which is keyed at one end portion of the rele vant shaft.When the developer is loaded and the pump 7 is opera ting, the rotor 15 is submitted to the jet of the che mi cal reagents under circulation, which jet is ccmine out from a nozzle 15 constituting the end portion of the return pipe c, which conveys the reagents back to the tank.Therefore, the ic energy of the delivery jet of the reagent is utilized to rotate the rotor 15 end, consequently, the drum 13 or the mandrel 1X. This solution permits the pump 7 to be rationally used and eliminates the need for a special operating deuce for the rotation of the supports for the films.According to an additional feature of the invention, a regulation valve 17 is inserted in the pipe 9 which delivers the reagents towards the tank, wherein this valve permits the dynamic characteristics of the jet 1 to be varied depending on the different rotational speeds which are required by the drum 13 or the mandrel 14.The valve 17 may be manually or automatically operated, in the last case by means of optical or electronic devices of any known kind.Furthermore, the tanks 5,6 contain some thermostati cally contrclled heating elements for the reagents and are provided with adequate protection covers.These cc mpcnents of the conventions type aren t repre sented in fig. 1.Finally, fig. 2 schematically represents a drying tank 20, in a partially cutaway view, which tank constitutes the last element cf the developer.The tank 20 is provided with a system which is similar to that one described for the tanks 5,6 of the chemical baths.Also in this case the film support in the drawing the mandrel 14 for tbe disc films has a rotor 15 which is operated by the jet 21 of the drying air, generated by a fan 22 The rotor 15 is included in an envelope 23 corrected to a duct 2t, which extends for the whole width of the tank 22 and is provided with slits 25 for the uniform air distribution o te films to be dried. An electric heat element 26 for heating the air is inserted into the duct 24. Therefore, also the drying tank 20 utilizes the principle on which the invention is based,namely that one to take advantage of the elements which are necessarily provided on the developer pump 7 for the circula tio of the chemical reagents, fan 22 for the circula ticn of the drying air for keeping the film supports in rctaticn, so eliminating additional control devices for the latter.
