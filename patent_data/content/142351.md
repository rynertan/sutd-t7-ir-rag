## Description
This invention relates to a method of preparing reforming catalysts of enhanced dispersion consisting of one or more Group VIII noble metals supported on zeolites, preferably a catalyst consisting of platinum on potassium containing zeolite L. The catalyst herein exhibits improved activity and activity maintenance for light naphtha aromatization over catalysts of lesser dispersion. Several materials have been employed as hydrocarbon conversion catalysts in such processes as reforming, catalytic dewaxing, alkylation, oxidation and hydrocracking. Examples of catalysts useful for this purpose include those materials comprising catalytically active metal such as a Group VIII noble metal and optionally rhenium supported on or impregnated into a carrier. Among the hydrocarbon conversion processes, catalytic reforming in the presence of hydrogen is one of the most important. Catalytic reforming is a refinery process designed to increase the octane number of naphtha. Typically in this process, the naphtha is passed over a suitable catalyst under reforming conditions, for example elevated temperatures and pressures well known in the industry in the presence of hydrogen gas and a H₂ hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 2 to 20. This process involves several different types of reactions, including isomerization, dehydrocyclization of paraffins to produce naphthenes and aromatics, dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes and other naphthenes and alkanes, isomerization dehydrogenation of cyclopentanes, isomerization of normal paraffins to isoparaffins, and hydrocracking. Paraffin isomerization occurs relatively easily, but contributes only a limited improvement in octane number. The reforming reactions most important for the production of high octane components ore those which produce aromatics. The ideal reaction scheme minimizes the hydrocracking of long chain paraffins to gaseous hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane to improve the yield and selectivity to more valuable products of the other reforming reactions, particularly dehydrocyclization. Examples of known catalysts useful for reforming include platinum and optionally rhenium or iridium on an alumina support, platinum on type X and Y zeolites, provided the reactants and products are sufficiently small to flow through the pores of the zeolites, and platinum on cation exchanged type L zeolites. While zeolite L catalysts, usually in their hydrogen form, have been employed as catalytic dewaxing catalysts and in other applications, they are particularly useful in reforming because they decrease the amount of hydrocracking which occurs during reforming. For example, US A 4,104,230 discloses that the use of zeolite L as a support increases the selectivity of the reaction for producing aromatic products. This improvement, however, has been made at the expense of catalyst life. EP A 96479 entitled Improved Zeolite L teaches that a highly crystalline zeolite L material having a cylindrical morphology leads to an improved catalyst life for dehydrocyclization reactions over a conventionally prepared zeolite L disclosed in US A 3,216,789. Finally, BE A 895,778 and 895,779 disclose use of a barium exchanged zeolite L catalyst for high yields in reforming, dehydrocyclization, dealkylation and dehydroisomerization. It is well known that coke deposits may be removed from deactivated catalysts by heating them in the presence of dilute oxygen at a flame front temperature of 430 to 540 GB A 1436622 describes a process for regenerating a reforming catalyst including oxychlorination and subsequent treatment with oxygen. Although type L zeolite is mentioned as suitable, the particular description is limited to mordenite. The maximum chlorine content of the gas stream used in oxychlorination is 500 ppm. by volume and emphasis is placed on the necessity for dry conditions. No mention is made of the utility of the process in the preparation of fresh catalyst. DE A 1273494 describes a process for the preparation or regeneration of a hydrocracking catalyst. The process utilises an oxychlorination step following calcination but no mention is made of a subsequent treatment with oxygen. Dry conditions are preferred. The present invention provides a process for preparing a zeolite oil refining catalyst containing at least one Group VIII noble metal in which the activity of the freshly prepared catalyst, after an initial calcining step is augmented by subjection to oxychlorination and subsequent reduction in a hydrogen containing gas stream, characterised in that The catalyst is preferably treated subsequently by heating it to a temperature of from 400 to 530 The preferred catalysts prepared by the process herein consist of a type L zeolite having exchangeable cations of which at least 75 percent are selected from Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca and 8a cations which contain at least one Group VIII noble metal and are characterized in that the particles of the noble metal, prior to reduction, are well dispersed over the surface of the catalyst and more than about 90 of the noble metal prior to reduction, is dispersed in the form of particles having a diameter of less than about 7 Å. More preferably the catalyst will be such that more than 98 of the noble metal, prior to or after reduction, but preferably after reduction, is dispersed in the form of particles having a diameter less than about 7 Å and less than 2 is dispersed in the form of particles measured to have a diameter of 7 Å or greater. The method herein results in catalysts which have effective catalyst activity and activity maintenance for a sustained period of reforming. Figure 1 represents a plot of the selectivity for benzene as measured by the selectivity parameter weight ratio of benzene product to the sum of benzene plus C₂ to C₅ products achieved, as a function of the terminal cracking index TCI defined hereinbelow, for platinum on type L zeolites and for platinum on silica after a time on oil of either about 3 or about 22 hours.

Type L zeolites are defined herein as synthetic zeolites which crystallize in the hexagonal system with a characteristic x ray diffraction pattern obtained from CuK radiation with the major d A peak values set out in Table A Thus, they share a common zeolitic structure. For purposes of this invention, type L zeolites have a general formula as follows The type L zeolites are conventionally prepared such that M in the above formula is potassium. See, e.g., US A 3,216,789 and 3,867,512. The potassium can be ion exchanged, as is well known, by treating the zeolite in an aqueous solution containing other cations. It is difficult, however, to exchange more than 75 of the original potassium cations, because some cations occupy sites in the zeolite structure which are nearly inaccessible. At least 75 of the exchangeable cations are selected from lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, calcium and barium. More preferably, the cation is sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium, most preferably still, potassium, rubidium or cesium, most preferably potassium. Optionally, the exchangeable cations may consist of mixtures of the above named Group IA cations or mixtures of a Group IA cation and barium or calcium cations. These mixtures of cations may be achieved, for example by treating the zeolite L with an aqueous solution containing a rubidium and or cesium salt and then washing to remove excess ions. This ion exchange treatment can be repeated to effect further ion exchange, although to a lesser degree. The Group VIII noble metals which are necessary for catalytic activity are those metals from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements which are selected from osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, palladium and platinum. Preferably, the metals which are employed herein are platinum, rhodium or iridium, and most preferably platinum. The metals may be present in any combination desired. Rhenium, a Group VIIB metal, may also be present so long as at least one Group VIII noble metal is present. The amount of Group VIII noble metal present in the catalyst will be an effective amount and will depend, for example, on required catalyst activity, ease of uniform dispersion, and the crystal size of the type L zeolite. Crystal size limits the effective catalyst loading since highly loaded crystals of zeolite which have a large dimension parallel to the channels could easily lead to pore plugging during operation as the noble metal agglomerates inside the channels. Generally, however, the level of metal present will range from about 0.1 to 6 , preferably 0.1 to 3.5 and more preferably 0.1 to 2.5 by weight of the catalyst. Furthermore, the amount of metal present is generally from about 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of the catalyst if the average zeolite crystallite size parallel to the channels is greater than about 0.2 micron, and from about 1.0 to 6 by weight if the average zeolite crystallite size parallel to the channels is no greater than about 0.2 micron. The Group VIII noble metals may be introduced into the zeolite by, for example, ion exchange, impregnation, carbonyl decomposition, adsorption from the gaseous phase, introduction during zeolite synthesis, and adsorption of metal vapor. The preferred technique is ion exchange. In some cases, e.g., when the metal s have been introduced by an ion exchange process, it is preferred to remove the residual acidity of the zeolite by treating the catalyst, which has previously been reduced by hydrogen, with an aqueous solution of an alkaline base such as potassium carbonate. This treatment will neutralized any hydrogen ions formed during the reduction of Group VIII noble metal ions by hydrogen. The preferred reforming catalyst of enhanced dispersion produced by the process of this invention is a unique composition characterized by several properties which lead to improved selectivity and activity maintenance over what is exhibited by other reforming catalysts outside the class defined herein under the same catalytic conditions. The greater the degree of dispersion of the metal within the channels, i.e., onto the internal surface area of the zeolite, the better will be the activity maintenance of the catalyst. The activity of a catalyst is a measure of its ability to convert feed to products. While a catalyst may have a high activity, the products formed may not be necessarily the desired products. The term selectivity is a measure of the ability of the catalyst to convert feed to desired products. Activity maintenance concerns the ability of the catalyst to maintain a portion of its activity over time at conversion conditions, other variables remaining constant. The decline in catalyst activity at conversion conditions is believed to be due primarily to crystal growth or agglomeration of the noble metal particles and secondarily to the formation of coke on the external and internal surfaces of the catalyst. At the same noble metal loading, catalysts containing particles or crystals of noble metals of a size greater than that disclosed above are less active and less selective than catalysts containing the smaller particles. Coke formation, probably due to complex condensation and dehydrogenation reactions, results in the shielding of the noble metal from the reaction mixture, thereby limiting the catalytic sites available for promoting reactions. As catalytic activity declines by virtue of agglomeration and coke formation, the yield of desirable products will decline, and depending upon the economics of the operation a process employing the catalyst will have to be interrupted and catalyst activity restored to its initial value. Generally, catalytic activity can be maintained by increasing temperature, but there are limits beyond which the temperature cannot be increased, for example, temperatures which will change the nature of the zeolite or lead to undesirable side reactions. Catalyst activity will decline over time as severity increases. Factors which affect severity include the hydrogen to oil mole ratio, hydrogen partial pressure, total pressure, temperature, increasing feed rate per volume of catalyst space velocity , and type of hydrocarbon in the feed. In the measurement of activity maintenance all variables are fixed and only the catalyst differs. Thus, an activity of one catalyst over a period of time can be directly compared to the activity of another catalyst over the same time period where feed, hydrogen to oil ratios, pressures, etc., are constant. Catalyst may be evaluated for their activity maintenance by two tests. In the Standard Activity Test SAT which is conventionally employed, the catalyst is sieved, mixed with sieved siliica and charged into a reactor. The catalyst is then subjected to conditions of 510 A second test of activity maintenance known as the Expedited Catalyst Aging Test ECAT has been developed where a total of 0.20 g of catalyst consisting of 20 40 mesh particles is mixed with 0.80 g of SiO₂ of 20 40 mesh. The resulting catalyst charge is introduced into a stainless steel downflow reactor of about 1 cm inner diameter equipped with a thermocouple. Before introduction of feed the catalyst is reduced in situ under flowing H₂ gas at temperatures no greater than 525 The improvement in activity maintenance is manifested by the preferred catalysts produced by this invention in that they all provide a benzene yield in excess of 7 weight percent after 24 hours on oil in the ECAT test as described above using a feed comprising 20 by volume methylcyclopentane and 80 by volume n hexane. These preferred catalysts, at least prior to reduction thereof, consist of noble metal particles well dispersed over the surface of the catalyst. By the expression well dispersed over the catalyst surface is meant that the diameter of substantially all the particles in which the noble metal is dispersed is less than 7 Å, as described hereinbelow. By substantially all is meant that at least 90 , and preferably greater than 98 , of the noble metal is dispersed in the form of smaller than 7 Å particles. Initial dispersion of the catalyst is found to correlate directly with its activity maintenance when it is subjected to reforming conditions. The surface of the catalyst over which the particles are dispersed necessarily includes the internal surface of the catalyst, i.e., the channels of the zeolite, but may also include dispersion over the external surface, which is considerably smaller. The dispersion will be present on those surfaces of the catalyst which are accessible to noble metal loading and dispersion techniques. The most preferred catalyst will contain highly dispersed noble metal atoms, all or substantially all of which are located inside the pores of the catalyst rather than on the exterior surface thereof. Thus, at least 75 and preferably, at least 90 , of the noble metal will exist inside the channels of the preferred catalyst herein. Further, the noble metal inside the channels must be well dispersed. The property that the particles be well dispersed over the surface of the catalyst implies that there is no preferential disposition of noble metal particles on the external surface. In other words, it signifies that the noble metal is substantially uniformly distributed throughout the internal and external surfaces of the catalyst. Additionally, the preferred catalyst produced by the process herein is characterized in that more than about 90 of the noble metal prior to reduction thereof is dispersed in the form of particles having a diameter less than about 7 Å. Thus, if, for example, more than 10 of the noble metal is dispersed in the form of particles measured to have diameters of 12 15 Å, or if more than 10 of the noble metal is dispersed in the form of particles measured to have diameters of greater than 15 Å, the catalyst exhibits reduced activity and activity maintenance. As measured by conventional bright field imaging in a transmission electron microscope with 4 Å point to point resolution, the particle size in the most preferred catalyst produced herein is found to be such that no greater than 2 of the noble metal is dispersed in the form of particles measured to be about 7 Å or greater in diameter. The noble metal atoms may be clustered in any type of configuration, including that in which the atoms are connected to form a raft shape where they exist as a monatomic layer. The size of the particles as described above may be measured using high resolution electron microscopy. In this procedure, described in P.C. Flynn et al., When different samples are compared under the electron microscope, there is a 50 uncertainty in the relative thickness of the specimen. Consequently, the estimated percent amount of visible particulates 7 Å and greater if rafts, 5 Å and greater if spheroids is subject to this same 50 uncertainty. For example, a catalyst reported as comprising 10 noble metal particles measuring 7 A diameter or greater, and 90 below 7 Å in diameter could actually consist of between 5 and 15 of visible particles measuring 7 Å and greater in diameter and between 95 and 85 of highly dispersed clusters below 7 Å in diameter. As an additional characteristic, if the catalyst is Loaded with the noble metal by, for example, an ion exchange technique, it is desirable that the type L zeolite chosen as a support have, prior to being loaded with the noble metal, a pH between 9.3 and 11.5 as determined by the following method A 2.5 g sample of zeolite is equilibrated at ambient temperature with 70 cc of distilled water and the pH of the slurry is determined. The pH should be higher than about 9.3, preferably 10 to 11. If the pH of the zeolite is not within the above range, we believe that traditional impregnation or ion exchange methods will not yield a catalyst which has highly dispersed noble metal particles within a preferred size range. While not limited to any one theory, the belief is that the pH of the zeolite characterizes a surface state of the zeolite and controls the affinity of the zeolite for the noble metal during ion exchange or impregnation. Another feature of the preferred catalyst produced herein which identifies those catalysts having the improved activity maintenance as defined herein is its Terminal Cracking Index TCI . This index is defined as the molar ratio of pentanes to butanes produced when the catalyst is evaluated by ECAT procedures described above using 100 n hexane feed. The index measures the degree to which terminal cracking is promoted as opposed to internal cracking for a given catalyst. The higher this index the more selective the catalyst herein toward aromatization products because increased terminal cracking relative to internal carbon cracking of the hydrocarbon chain as measured by reforming n hexane indicates that terminal adsorption of the substrate onto the noble metal occurs preferentially, as opposed to internal adsorption, thus favoring, for example, 1 6 closures for aromatization of hexane. This index shows not only that to perform well the preferred catalyst herein must not be acidic, but also that the noble metal is not to any significant extent on the exterior surface of the catalyst, but rather is inside the channels of the catalyst and adsorbs the terminal carbon atom of straight chain paraffins. For purposes herein, the terminal cracking index of the preferred type L zeolite catalysts produced by the process herein is greater than about 1.5, preferably greater than about 1.7. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the selectivity parameter defined as the weight ratio of benzene product to the sum of total benzene plus C₂ C₅ produced and the Terminal Cracking Index TCI for zeolite L loaded with 0.6 Pt. The relationship shows a clear correlation, indicating that the terminal cracking index does accurately identify the selective reforming catalysts when a type L zeolite is employed as the catalyst base. Fig. 1 also illustrates that a conventional active 0.6 Pt on silica catalyst has a much lower terminal cracking index which does not exceed 1.0. Such a value is typical of random cracking of a hexane molecule. The TCI of a given catalyst varies with the type of feed and the severity of the conversion. Generally, as the result of secondary cracking reactions, the TCI for catalysts which have a TCI above one under ECAT conditions described above will decrease as the conversion is increased, as indicated in the following Table I. These results show that ECAT is a better test for determining the TCI of a catalyst than the SAT test because the TCI is not meaningful at the high conversion levels encountered under SAT test conditions. The TCI also varies with the type of catalyst employed, as indicated in Table II. These results show that the catalyst of this invention which has a high TCI also has a high benzene yield. Experiments have shown, however, that the correlation between TCI and benzene yield cannot be made when the reforming catalyst is much less catalytically active than the catalysts listed in Table II above such as, e.g., platinum supported on KOH treated K treated silica alumina. We believe that catalysts based on type L zeolites which have the preferred noble metal particle size and dispersion as described above will necessarily have the terminal cracking index. The preferred catalysts of this invention also exhibit substantial monofunctionality. Many known reforming catalysts exhibit bifunctionality in that not only do the noble metal atoms participate in the catalytic reaction, but also the acidic sites of the catalyst support. For example, a conventional catalyst consisting of Pt Re metals on alumina aromatizes hexane through both the metal sites and the acid sites of the alumina support. In contrast, the catalyst herein behaves essentially monofunctionally in that the catalytic reactions predominantly occur on the noble metal sites of the catalyst, with only a small amount of catalysis occurring on the acidic sites initially produced when the catalyst is first reduced. In the more specific embodiment of the invention described below the gaseous streams used in each step have a remaining percentage which is not water, hydrogen, oxygen or a source of chlorine of an inert gas such as helium, argon or nitrogen which will not interfere with the process. Preferably water is present in the gaseous stream of each step. In this more preferred and detailed embodiment, in the first step the freshly prepared catalyst is contacted with a gaseous stream containing from 0 to 10 by volume water, preferably 0.5 to 5 by volume, more preferably 1 3 , based on the total stream volume, and oxygen usually in the form of an oxygencontaining gas such as air , hydrogen or an inert gas, at a temperature of 380 to 540 The second step of this specific method can proceed in one of four manners In the third step of this specific method oxygen post treat step , the catalyst is contacted with an oxygen containing gaseous stream where the amount of oxygen in the stream is generally 0.1 to 25 by volume, preferably 0.2 to 15 , more preferably 0.5 to 12 at a temperature of 400 to 540 In a fourth and final step hydrogen reduction step the catalyst is heated in the presence of a hydrogen containing gaseous stream where the amount of hydrogen in the stream is generally 1 to 25 by volume, preferably 2 to 20 in the presence of from 0 to 10 by volume water at a temperature of from about 400 to 530 In all steps, reactor pressure is generally from 0.1 to 2 MPa. Preferably the gas flow rates for each step in the above process range from about 1 to 300 ml g of catalyst per minute. If no oxychlorination step is employed, preferably the gas flow rate of the oxygen post treat step is below 20 ml g catalyst min. and preferably below 10 ml g catalyst min. Optionally, the second step can consist of a chlorination step followed by an oxychlorination step as described hereinabove. The catalysts of enhanced dispersion produced by the process of this invention may be employed as reforming catalysts using reforming conditions which are well known in the art. To minimize any hydrocracking reactions which tend to prevail at the beginning of the reaction, it may be desirable to introduce a small amount less than 0.1 by weight of sulfur to the catalyst. The following discussion is particularly directed to the preferred catalysts produced by the process herein which have the special properties defined above. Without being limited to any one theory, it is believed that the selectivity and activity of the catalyst are greatly influenced by the manner in which the reactant molecules ace adsorbed at the active site of the catalyst. This theory is hereinafter called molecular die catalysis. If the hexane is adsorbed terminally through the C₁ atom , subsequent reaction preferably leads to aromatization. Another reaction occurring to a lesser extent is terminal cracking of adsorbed hexane. If initial adsorption is through a nonterminal carbon atom, no such aromatization can occur because end carbon activation is required for 1 6 ring closure. While terminal cracking also leads to methane production, the aromatization reaction occurs to a greater extent. The adsorption pattern may be influenced by the three dimensional structure of the pores of the catalyst, which may columnate the reactant molecules. Furthermore, the interior structures of and spacial factors within the catalyst may affect favorably post adsorption reactions as by, e.g., stabilizing or destabilizing the transition states so as to favor cyclization of adsorbed molecular species. The channel structure of the zeolites gives rise to these molecular die effects, i.e, the zeolite one dimensional channel structure orients the hexane molecules parallel to the axis of the channels. This orientation facilitates terminal adsorption onto the noble metal particles, leading to the observed increased activity and selectivity for aromatization. The catalysts of enhanced dispersion produced by the process herein need not be used only in conventional reforming of naphthas derived from petroleum or other sources of hydrocarbons and boiling in the range of about 71 to 216 Additional reactions where the reforming catalyst produced by the process herein, especially the preferred class of catalysts produced herein, may be employed advantageously include benzene production from streams such as light naphtha, i.,e., a naphtha boiling between about 30 and 100 The reforming processes described above are carried out under general reforming conditions in the presence of hydrogen at a moderate pressure to favor the aromatization reaction thermodynamically. For traditional reforming of paraffins to aromatics, the temperature depends on the particular paraffin, but for acceptable rate and selectivity preferably ranges from about 400 to 550 The dehydrocyclization reaction is generally carried out by injecting a feedstock charge in the presence of hydrogen gas into a reactor containing the catalyst. The examples which follow illustrate the efficacy of the invention. In all examples, parts and percentages are given by weight for solids and liquids and by volume for gas compositions, and temperatures in degrees Centigrade unless otherwise noted. A zeolite L having a composition expressed in moles of pure oxide of 0.99 K₂0 Al₂O₃ 6.3 SiO₂ xH₂0 and having a cylindrical shape and an average particle size of dHdd 2 to 2.5 micron was prepared by the technique described in Example 1 of EP Patent Application 96479, entitled Improved Zeolite L . Thus, an alkaline synthesis gel was prepared by dissolving 23.40 g of aluminum hydroxide by boiling in an aqueous solution of 51.23 g of potassium hydroxide pellets 86 pure KOH in 100.2 g of water to form Solution A. After dissolution, any water loss was corrected. A separate solution, Solution B, was prepared by diluting 225 g of colloidal silica Ludox HS 40 with 195.0 g of water. Solutions A and B were mixed for two minutes to form a gel, and just before the gel became fully stiff, 224 g thereof was transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave, preheated to 150 The separated zeolite was slurried in water and Pt NH₃ ₄Cl₂ solution was added over about two hour period. Following the addition of the Pt source stirring was continued overnight. The mixture was then filtered and the loaded potassium exchanged zeolite L, containing 0.6 Pt by weight, was dried, tableted, crushed, screened to 0.84 0.42 mm 20 40 mesh and calcined. A total of 4.7 g of this freshly prepared catalyst A was contacted with a series of gas compositions as described below flowing at a rate of 200 ml minute for the given period of time. The remaining percentage of the gas compositions consisted of He gas. The resulting catalyst B of enhanced dispersion and untreated catalyst A were evaluated for production of benzene using the ECAT procedure described above using a feed of 20 methylcyclopentane and 80 n hexane. Catalyst A was calcined at 350 Electron micrographs of Catalyst A after calcination at 350 This example also shows that the dispersed catalyst shows higher activity and activity maintenance than the freshly prepared catalyst. A total of 4.2 g of catalyst A was contacted as described in Example 1 with the following feed compositions The resulting catalyst C of enhanced dispersion had the following ECAT results as compared to catalyst A of Example 1 using a feed of 100 n hexane A total of 7.0 g of catalyst A was contacted as described in Example 1 with the following feed compositions no water The resulting catalyst D of enhanced dispersion had the following ECAT results, as compared to the performance of catalyst A of Example 1, using a feed of 20 methylcyclopentane and 80 n hexane The results show that both Cl₂ and HCl may be employed and that wet treatments produce a more durable catalyst. Another catalyst was prepared by contacting a total of 4.6 g of catalyst A as described in Example 1 with the following gas compositions, where all gas streams except the dry O₂ post treat flowed at 200 ml min. and the O₂ post treat feed flowed at 50 ml min. The resulting catalyst E of enhanced dispersion had good ECAT results using a 100 n hexane feed, as compared to the results of catalyst A of Example 1, but not as good as calalyst C. A total of 16 g of the freshly prepared catalyst A of Example 1 was contacted as in Example 1 with a series of the following gas compositions flowing at a rate of 200 ml min. for the given period of time. The remaining percentage of the gas compositions is He gas. The resulting catalyst F of enhanced dispersion was compared with catalyst A for production of benzene using the ECAT procedure described above and a feed of 20 methylcyclopentane and 80 n hexane. The results are indicated below All of the above examples show that the multi step method described herein improves catalyst activity and activity maintenance. Further, Example 1 shows that the multi step method also improves the dispersion of the platinum. However the results using wet O₂ treatments are superior for both types of feed. A fresh catalyst G consisting of 0.6 Pt on zeolite L was prepared as described in steps a and b of Example 1 except that heating to crystallize was carried out by rapid heating to 100 Listed below are the results using the ECAT procedure described in Example 5 on the resulting catalyst H of enhanced dispersion as compared with the non dispersed catalyst G. The results show that the enhanced dispersion procedure herein improves the activity and activity maintenance of the low activity catalyst G, although not necessarily to the level of a fresh catalyst such as catalyst A of Example 1, which has good activity before enhanced dispersion. Figure 5, depicting the electron micrograph of catalyst H, shows that the Pt was far more dispersed than in the fresh catalyst G prior to the multi step treatment. Thus, Figure 5 showed that, in catalyst H, 85 of the Pt was dispersed in the form of particles having a diameter less than about 7 Å and 15 measured to be 7 Å or greater. In contrast, Figure 4, showing the electron micrograph of catalyst G, indicated that 70 of the Pt was dispersed in the form of agglomerates having diameter measured to be 100 Å or larger, 5 measured to be 10 Å and only 25 had a diameter less than about 7 Å. In summary, the present invention is seen to provide a method for preparing reforming catalysts of enhanced dispersion, preferably potassium exchanged zeolite L containing platinum, which exhibit improved catalyst activity and activity maintenance.
