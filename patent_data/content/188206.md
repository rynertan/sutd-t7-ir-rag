# System for generating a substantially uniform plasma.

## Abstract
A system for generating a substantially uniform plasma for processing a substrate 32 having two major surfaces, each with electrically conductive portions. Two electrodes 28,30 are oppositely disposed with respect to one another on either side of the substrate. A first r.f. power source 34 is electrically connected to the first electrode 28 and a second r.f. power source 36 is electrically connected to the second electrode 30 . The first and second r.f. power sources are out of phase with respect to one another, resulting in the generation of a substantially uniform plasma field.
