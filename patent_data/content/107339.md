# Method for yarn piecing in fasciated yarn spinning unit.

## Abstract
A novel method for yarn piecing in a fasciated yarn spinning unit, in which a broken end of a yarn and the fiber bundle to be pieced together are nipped and intermingled with each other between a soft nipping area 2 between middle top and bottom aprons and thereafter are false twisted by a vortex in an air nozzle 3 . Motions of the asso ciated parts are controlled so as to be able to achieve a suit able overlapping length of the yarn and the fiber bundle in the nipping area of the aprons 7,7 .
