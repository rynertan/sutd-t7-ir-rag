# CHITOSAN DERIVATIVES IN THE FORM OF COORDINATED COMPLEXES WITH FERROUS IONS

## Abstract
Chitosan derivatives in the form of coordinated com plexes with ferrous ions in which coordinated bonds are established between the ferrous ion and the amino group and hydroxyl group present respectively in position 2 and position 3 of the chitosan glucosamine ring. Said chitosan derivatives are soluble in an aqueous medium and are able to release iron into the gastrointestinal tract in a controlled manner.
