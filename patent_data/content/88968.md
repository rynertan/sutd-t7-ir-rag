# A method for further forming a metal closure and a metal container end.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates the strength of ends 10 used on metal beverage containers. Such ends generally comprise a central panel portion of a substantially planar character, a surrounding U shaped sidewall having inner and outer legs, a curved intermediate portion integrally joining the inner leg to the U shaped sidewall, and the peripheral curl extending from the outer leg for double seaming the end onto a can body. The intermediate portion and adjacent central panel portion are firmly supported by a die 27 while a clamping force is placed on an annular band of the upper surface 45 of the end at the intermediate portion. The clamping force is increased until metal flows inwardly and outwardly from the contact point 34 resulting in a free compression doming of the center panel and an outward deflection of the inner leg. An end of increased buckle resistance is thereby produced which end is approximately within standard dimensions such that customers can use the end of the existing seaming equipment without alteration. An optional feature is pro vided to minimize the compression doming by clamping a peripheral band of the end with a hold down pad 44 while the metal flowing is accomplished. This reduces the dome depth and results in a strengthened end having a dome depth very close to standard specifications.
