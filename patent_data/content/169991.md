# An optical signal recorder employing a transducer having an adjustable dichroic mirror.

## Abstract
A transducer or optical head arrangement for an optical disk recorder includes an adjustably mounted dichroic beam combiner. The adjustments are in two degrees of freedom about a pivot point 48 located near a light beam entry point. The write light source 21 has its emitted beam reflected to the optical disk 10 through a minimum of optical elements. The readback or sensing elements 23 are optically coupled to the optical disk via a light path 30 extending through the beam combiner entering at about the pivot point. The sensing elements include a second light source 24 , an optical detector 65 and a beam splitter 62 . The two light sources are shown as semiconductive laser emitting diffe rent frequency light beams. A four screw, adjustably mounted aperture plate 46 retains a partial spherical dichroic beam combiner 41 in a cavity of an optical support 40 .
