# A chamber block with a removable supernatant collection vial.

## Abstract
A chamber block 12 removably insertable into a centrifuge rotor of the type used for the preparation of cell dispersions on slides 65 is characterized by an opening 150 formed in the chamber block 12 and sized to removably receive a supernatant collection vial 152 therein. A deflection baffle is disposed within the chamber block 12 so that supernatant withdrawn through a suction conduit 156 from the vicinity of the slide 65 is deflected into the collection vial 152 . When the vial 152 is received within the opening 150 , a portion of the vial 152 protrudes beyond the block 12 , to facilitate manipulation by an operator.
