# PAPERMAKING MACHINE

## Abstract
There is described a papermaking machine of the type wherein a web of lignocellulosic fibers is formed, and wherein the formed web is transferred to a dewatering and imprinting felt, said felt and web then passing through a nip formed by a pressure roll and a drying cylinder so as to deposit the web on the drying cylinder, said web having a dryness level between 7 percent and 35 percent as it enters said nip, characterized by the felt having imprinting yarn strands forming knuckles adja cent to the web contacting surface of the felt, the imprinting yarn strands having a spacing of about 6 to about 25 per 0.0254 meters but not significantly exceeding the average fiber length, the felt having a web facing greater than about 153 grams per square meter, and the felt having a ratio of face web in per square meter to the diameter in meters of the imprinting yarn strands adjacent to the web contacting side of the felt of from about 60,000 to about 600,000 wereby the web is differentially pressed onto the dryer surface. The ma chine of this invention is especially useful in manufacturing sanitary paper tissue and towel products.
