# Preparation of vanadium phosphorus catalysts using a mixed phosphorus source and use thereof in oxidation of C4 hydro carbons to maleic anhydride.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of oxidation catalysts containing mixed oxides of vanadium and phosphorus comprises a introducing a pentavalent vanadium containing compound into a liquid medium capable of reducing the valence state of said vanadium b effecting reduction of at least a portion of said vanadium to a valence state of approximately 4 c adding a mixed phosphorus component compris ing orthophosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid to said medium prior to or subsequent to effecting said reduc tion to form a catalyst precursor d recovering the catalyst precursor e drying the catalyst precursor f calcining the catalyst precursor Improved results are obtained by the use as the mixed phosphorus of component one containing ortho phosphoric and pyrophosphoric acid. The catalyst are useful in the oxidation of Câ‚„ hydro carbons to maleic anhydride.
