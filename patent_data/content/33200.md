## Abstract
Process for the production of vesicular recording materi als. The photographic characteristics such as speed and con trast of vesicular recording materials are improved by treating the light sensitive vesicular recording layer with an aqueous medium at 5 to 30 C for at least 45 minutes. The treatment may be effected by spraying with cold water and winding the wet material into a roll. Water marking in the wound roll can be avoided by coating the recording layer prior to water treatment with an antimarking composition such as a solution of nitrocellulose.
