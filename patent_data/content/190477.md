# Body mounted pump housing and pump assembly employing the same.

## Abstract
A self contained body mounted pump assembly for continuously administering a therapeutic agent parenterally. The pump may have a transparent top 3 through which the contents can be seen and outwardly flaring sides to provide for comfort, stability and other useful features. A discharge passageway 20 is provided in the side wall externally from a point proximate the internal top surface 26 to a point proximate the body contacting surface 22 . The pump assembly is driven by a fluid imbibing, preferably osmotic pump 11 and contains its own source of actuating fluid 15 . Means for superimposing a pulse dose 60 on the tonic flow are also described.
