## Description
PLASTIC WHEELED CART CHASSISBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the field of wheeled carts such as to those used as grocery shopping carts in supermarkets and the like, and more particularly, is directed to a novel plastic wheeled cart chassis for use with a bottom supported basket. Ideally, carts of this type, and particularly those used in supermarkets and grocery stores, should have the following characteristics. First, they should be able to withstand a great deal of abuse, particularly to the basket portion. Carts are continuously impacted with one another and with stationary objects. Second, the carts should be easy to push and to maneuver. The condition of the cart wheels has a great effect on this characteristic, but so does the weight of the cart. Third, the carts should be of such design and such surface finish as not to have a propensity to collect dirt and contaminants.Fourth, the carts should be able to withstand cleaning by strong detergents or steam. Fifth, the carts usually must have sides of openwork construction, because customers wish to be able to observe the contents of the carts from any angle. Sixth, the carts should be attractive and should maintain their attractiveness over a long period of time. For the most part, the carts present in the prior art comprise a tubular metal frame or chassis to which is attached a basket of open wire work construction. The wires are in various crossing patterns, and they are usually welded together at the crossing points. Heavier wire reinforcement is used where necessary. Conventionally, the cart frame and the basket are integral with one another. That is, the basket wires and the frame components are welded together at appropriate points, or.thwires are interlocked with the frame components. To promote eleanliness and attractiveness, the entire cart is chrome plated. Sometimes plastic or rubber bumpers are installed at strategic points, such as opera. The prior art carts do not satisfy all of the requirements set forth above. Many of the deficiencies associated with such carts have to do with the basket portion. The wires in the basket are welded at the crossing points, and the basket is then chrome plated, the latter to provide a imootil, clesnable, attractive surface. The welding process for such an item is Intricate, as is the plating process. It is therefore not uncommon to have welds and plating of marginal quality so that, upon bard impact, or upon a series of impacts over a period of time, wire welds and the plating are broken.The plating is also subject to being removed by wear and by scraping against other objects This allows the base metal to rust. Also, if the basket is used in an environment where corrosion of metals is a problem, such as In grocery stores, the base metal exposed at the broken welds will corrode. The carat, and particularly the basket, then becomes unsightly and unattractive. At those same exposed points, food particles can become entrap in small cracks and crevices, even if the baskets are periodically cleaned, resulting in an unsanitary condition.In addition, articles placed in the basket can become pinched or snared by the unsecured wires and plating, causing inconvenience for the customer and inflicting damage to the goods. Impacts also frequently cause the basket to be de for med inwardly, giving rise to all of the above prob less, Repair of cart baskets is a problem in itself, because it is dif ficult to bend the wires back into shape, and it is difficult and expensive to reweld and replate them. The cart frame and the basket are often integral with one another in prior art carts, and therefore they cannot easily be taken apart to allow repair or replacement of components. To replace the basket, welds must be broken, then replaced.Or complicated bending and interlocking of wires is pieces sary during disassembly and assembly. Usually, the cart is simply not repaired. When it becomes too unsightly or too unsanitary to be used, it is discarded. The loss of the entire cart for the sake of the basket is certainly uneconomical. The above described deficiencies associated with baskets of wire work construction were addressed in Applicant s U.S. Patent No.3,999,774 and 4,273,346. These patents disclose a plastic basket for use on a metal frame and have resulted in carts that are far superior to those previously known in the art. While such carts represent a significant advancement in the art, they are not the ideal cart because of the use of a metal frame or chassis. A metal frame suffers from many of the same problems and concerns described above with respect to baskets of wire construction.Thus, they are susceptible to broken welds and plating, have a propensity to collect dirt and contaminants and cannot be easily separated from the basket to make repairs or perform routine maintenance such as cleaning. Thus, as with baskets of wire construction, metal frames or chassis deteriorate rather quickly and must be discarded. Carts having metal frames are also quite heavy, making them difficult to push and to maneuver, especially if they have some malfunction of the wheels.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the overall object of the present invention to provide a new plastic chassis for use with a basket which overcomes the disadvantages of prior art frames and chassis. A specific object of the present invention is to provide a new plastic chassis which is not easily damaged by impact. Another specific object of the present invention is to provide a new plastic chassis which is easy to clean. Another specific object of the present invention is to provide a new plastic ci sis which ean be quickly and releasably mounted to a basket. A further specific object of the present invention is to provide a new ic chassis which is lighter In weight than chassis known in the prior art. A still further specific object of the present invention is to proTide 8 new tic chassis which does not prevent basket nesting when a basket is mounted on the chaa. Another specific object of the present invention is to provide a new plastic chassis which is less noisy than chassis known in the Prior art Another specific object of the present invention is to provide a new plastic chassis which is more attractive than prior art chassis, and which maintains this attractiveness over a long period of time. Another specific object of the present invention is to provide a new phatic chassis which can be quickly and releasably coupled to a basket. The chassis in accordance rith the present invention is made of plastic, such as polyethylene, which is strong, light weight, has a smooth finish, and can deform somewhat to absorb impact and then return to its ortgiwial shape. The chassis is molded as an integrally unit. Thus there are no seams to break, or cracks and crevices to collect dirt. The plastic does not rust or corrode under the influence of food acids and the like. The use of a plastic chassis has been found to substantially reduce the weight of an average cart. Rigidity is provided to the chassis by the use of suitable integral strengthening ribs, beams and strut The arrangement of the ribs, beams and struts enable the chassis of the present invention to carry a very large load without buckling under stress One of the key features of this invention is the fact that the chassis can be replaced, if necessary, and further, that it can be replaced quite easily. The top portion of the chassis includes coupling means for quickly and releasably coupling the chassis to a basket having corresponding coupling means. The coupling means includes male locking elements which cooperate with corresponding female locking elements on the basket. Therefore, the basket may be quickly coupled to the chassis.Thus, damage to the basket does not require that the chassis be discarded and damage to the chassis does not require that the basket be discarded. A damaged basket may be quickly removed and a new basket installed on the cart chassis and a damaged chassis may likewise be removed and a new one installed. Another advantage is that the plastic chassis can be made in a variety of bright colors. This makes the cart more attractive. It also makes the cart more visible, which reduces accidents both inside the store and outside on the parking lot. The noise produced by movement of carts which have the chassis of the invention or, by impacting it with other carts or other objects, is considerably less than with carts having chassis known in the prior art.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of the plastic chassis in accordance with the present chassis.
