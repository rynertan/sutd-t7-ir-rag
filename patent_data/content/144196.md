# Blow molded bottle shaped container of biaxially oriented thermoplastic synthetic resin with wide port.

## Abstract
A blow molded bottle shaped container of biaxially oriented thermoplastic synthetic resin which comprises a cylindrical neck portion of a thick short cylindrical shape formed between a neck edge portion formed in a curved surface improved for openability of a cap on the outer lower peripheral surface thereof and in a curved surface improved for the sealability to the packing of the cap on the upper surface thereof and a thin bottomed cylindrical body formed by biaxial orientation blow molding, said neck edge portion being formed in the state of obliquely outwardly upwardly from said cylindrical neck portion, said body integrated in the state of abruptly bending and swelling outwardly from the lower central port of said cylindrical neck portion. Thus, the bottle shaped container can prevent the dimensions of the surface of the neck edge portion by the pressure and heat acted on the container body from varying by disposing the cylindrical neck portion for preventing the transmission of a stress and deforming force from the body to the neck edge portion between the blow molded body of biaxially oriented resin and the neck edge portion to be associated with a cap.
