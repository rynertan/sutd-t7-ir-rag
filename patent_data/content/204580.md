# Modular structures for prefabricated buildings.

## Abstract
Prefabricated modules, such as exterior wall panels 2, 4, 5 are arranged on a base with adjustable means for supporting the modules. The modules have transverse bores 25, 26 perpendicular to the general plane of the module and crossing other bores 69 lying in the general plane of the module, opening at a corresponding edge, and extending inwardly beyond the transverse bores 25, 26 . On coupling of the modules, the said other bores 69 of one module coaxially oppose the said other bores 69 of the adjacent edge of an adjacent module. The opposed bores 69 house a fastening bold 45 at least one end of which has a frusto conical sector 46a, 46 a which leads to an enlarged head 46, 46a and which is acted on by at least one setscrew 48 , having a frusto conical front, in a corresponding transverse bore 25, 26 , in order to urge the adjacent modules towards each other.
