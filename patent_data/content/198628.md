## Abstract
A method and device 10 for separating blood into fluid and cellular fractions for diagnostic tests. The whole blood 34 is introduced to a carrier 36 containing a layer of car bohydrate and reagent material which results in the rapid separation of the fluid 38A from the cellular fractions 38 . In a preferred embodiment, the device is fabricated in a sandwich design containing the layers of carbohydrate and reagent ma terial between two layers of plastic.
