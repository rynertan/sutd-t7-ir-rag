## Description
Thermal overload relays have been known heretofore. For example, patent FR A 2342550 shows a thermal overload relay intended to be connected in a three phase power supply to a three phase motor which includes means responsive to the currents in the individual phases and a contact breaking switch arranged to be actuated by the current responsive means in the event of the current on all three phases exceeding a threshold and also in the event of a differential, above a second threshold, and with the magnitude of the second, or differential threshold increasing with the mean value of the currents of all phases. Thermal overload relays generally constitute a thermal responsive element for each phase of the protected device represented by individual poles of the relay, the thermal responsive elements driving a switch actuating mechanism to open a circuit to the protected device. Current responsive heater elements are associated with each thermal responsive means. The heater elements are made to be readily replaceable to change operative current ranges of the relay or to replace damaged heater elements. The heater elements are commonly coils of heater resistance wire which are disposed axially around or within a cylindrical thermal responsive member and have terminals which connect to terminal plates provided on the relay. Patent GB A 696299 shows a thermal overload relay as described above. The individual replaceable heaters are modular units each comprising an insulating housing part that is complementally received by the relay housing, a heater element such as a wire coil or a substantially cylindrical heater strip and a pair of terminals connecting the heater element to terminal plates on the relay. Patent GB A 674085 provides variations in the modular heater units usable in the relay of patent GB A 696299, the heater elements comprising wound wire coils or cylindrically shaped strips. Present design requirements for thermal overload relays, and for electromagnetic contactors with which they are associated, is to reduce the particular dimensions which define surface area on a panel to which they are mounted in use, such as width and height. The circular shape of the coil or cylinder type heater element is disposed in planes constituting both these dimensions. However, practical limits exist as to how small the diameter of such heater elements and their associated thermal responsive elements may be made, such limits hindering reducing the dimensions of the relay. An object of the invention is to provide an improved reduced size thermal overload relay. A more specific object of the invention is to provide a thermal overload relay with improved modular or cassette type, replaceable heaters for the respective phases of the power supply. Another specific object of the invention is to provide a reduced size plural phase thermal overload relay that can accommodate any one of a plurality of selected sets of thin cassette type heaters having flat resistance material elements of different ratings. These and other objects of the invention are obtained by providing a reduced size thermal overload relay for a control system having a plural phase A.C. source supplying a load comprising an insulating open top housing having a plurality of compartments at its lower portion and a lateral space therebelow, a plurality of thermal responsive means for the respective phases of said system, a plurality of conductive brackets mounted in said housing supporting said thermal responsive means so as to extend through said compartments into said space, a plurality of cassette heaters having heater elements mounted to insulating means disposed in said compartments from said open top of said housing and terminals for electrically connecting said heater elements to the respective phases of said system to be heated by the currents therein, connecting and positioning means for electrically connecting said heater elements to the respective brackets and therethrough to said terminal leads and concurrently positioning said exposed sides of said heater elements relative to the respective thermal responsive means to heat the latter according to the currents in the respective phases of said system, a switch mounted at one side of said housing and having terminals connectable to a control device for protection of said system, and actuator means in said space below said compartments responsive to said thermal responsive means under overload conditions for operating said switch, characterized by said brackets having terminal leads respectively connected thereto for connection to an external device, said cassette heaters insulating means comprising narrow insulating enclosures and said heater elements comprising flat elements mounted in said insulating enclosures leaving one side of said heater elements exposed and connecting and positioning means for electrically connecting said heater elements to the respective brackets and therethrough to said terminal leads and concurrently positioning said exposed side of said heater elements relative to the respective thermal responsive means to heat the latter according to the current in the respective phases of said system.

Fig. 20 is a right side elevational view of the switch of Figs. 1 and 2 showing its mounting means and the compensating bimetal member. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a reduced size thermal overload relay constructed in accordance with the invention. The size of this relay is less than five centimeters wide, less than five centimeters deep in its major body portion not counting its lower extensions whereby it is secured to a mounting panel which add approximately two centimeters to its depth, and approximately nine centimeters high. As shown in Figs. 1 4 this thermal overload relay is provided with a molded plastic insulating housing 2 having a switch 4 secured to the housing at its right hand side, and three cassette heaters 6, 8 and 10 at its upper portion mounted between switch 4 and left wall 2a of the housing. A release button 12a of a snap in hold down device 12 extends out through a hole 3c in the front wall of the housing below heaters 6, 8 and 10 which may be depressed to release the cassette heaters for removal as hereinafter more fully described. A reset button 14 extends up through a hole in the top of switch 4 for resetting the switch closed after it has been tripped open. Housing 2 has a pair of ventilating slots or openings 2b in its front wall for releasing heat from the interior of the housing. Housing 2 has a mounting lug 2c at the central lower portion of its rear wall as shown in Fig. 3 for securing the relay to a device such as a contactor to which it may be attached and connected. Housing 2 also has an extension or projection 2d at its lower left front corner with a vertical hole 2e therethrough for receiving a screw or the like for attaching the relay to a mounting panel or base or the like. Relay housing 2 and switch 4 are provided with means for rigidly securing the same to one another at two places shown in Figs. 2, 4 and 12. For this purpose, relay housing 2 is provided with a hole 2f shown in Fig. 4 at its lower right front portion for receiving an integrally molded cylindrical projection 4a shown in Figs. 12 and 20. Also, the upper right portion of the rear wall 2g of relay housing 2 is provided with a laterally outwardly flared slot 2h extending a short distance down from the upper edge of wall 2g shown in Figs. 4 and 8 for receiving a dovetail lug 4b shown in Figs. 12 and 20. To assemble the switch 4 onto the relay housing, projection 4a is first inserted into hole 2f and lug 4b is aligned with slot 2h and the switch is the pressed down until it bottoms with lug 4e sliding behind wall 2r. As a result, projection 4a extends through hole 2f and into cavity 2j in the bottom of the relay housing. The lower end of projection 4a may then be staked by applying heat and pressure or the like as shown in broken lines in Fig. 2 to permanently and rigidly secure the switch to the relay housing. It will be apparent in Fig. 12 that dovetail lug 4b is molded partly integrally with base 4c of the switch and is molded partly integrally with cover 4d of the switch so that this divided lug not only retains the switch on the relay housing but also helps to clamp the cover 4d of the switch to the switch base 4c in addition to other securing means such as rivets 4f and 4g, Fig. 20, used therefor. Fig. 8 which is a top view of the relay housing more clearly shows hole 2f and flared slot 2h which are used for securing the switch to the relay housing. For the three phase overload relay shown in Fig. 1, three like thermal responsive means or bimetal supporting terminal brackets or lead subassemblies 16, 18 and 20 shown in Figs. 2 and 5 are press in or snap in mounted within the relay housing. For this purpose, the relay housing is provided with three compartments 2k, 2l and 2m as shown in the top view in Fig. 8 which are defined by left wall 2a, which extends all the way up as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and interior walls 2n, 2o and 2p which extend part way up within the relay housing as shown in Figs. 2 and 4. Rightmost inner wall 2p has a rectangular hole 2q in it as shown in Fig. 4 to provide space for the switch operating mechanism such as the differential bars 30 and 32 as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Switch housing 2 also has a short right wall 2r shown in Figs. 8 10 extending a short distance upwardly and a short distance forwardly from rear wall 2g for enclosing the compartment 22 into which compensating bimetal member 24 of switch 4 is suspended and into which operating member 26 of switch 4 extends for actuation by crank 28 that is operated by the differential bars including driver bar 30 and follower bar 32 as shown in Figs. 8 11. This partial wall 2r has a recess 2s at its upper forward inner surface to provide clearance for switch actuating member 26 as shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Switch 4 has a short downwardly extending lug 4e integrally molded on its base 4c as shown in Figs. 12 and 20 which slides inwardly of wall 2r as the switch is assembled onto the thermal relay housing to assist in maintaining the switch in its position along with the staked projection 4a and the dovetail lug 4b hereinbefore described. Referring again to Fig. 8, it will be apparent that housing 2 of the relay is provided with means for receiving and rigidly retaining bimetal supporting and connector lead supporting brackets 16, 18 and 20. These brackets 16, 18 and 20 are alike and one of them, bracket 16 shown in Figs. 6 and 7, will be described. As shown in Fig. 6, this bracket 16 has a generally H shaped configuration with its two upper arms 16a and 16b being longer than its two lower legs 16c and 16d and the upper ends of its upper arms being joined by an integral attachment platform 16e. A central tongue 16f extends upwardly from its lateral connecting portions 16x into the space between upper arms 16a and 16b and is offset to one side, left side in Fig. 2, in parallel relation to arms 16a and 16b as shown in the rear view in Fig. 7. The upper end portions of arms 16a and 16b between tongue 16f and platform 16e are connected by a narrow lateral strip 16g to which is secured as by welding a connector lead 16h that extends horizontally rearwardly through a slot in the rear wall of the housing of the overload relay as shown in Fig. 3 for connection to a contactor or the like. A bimetal strip 16j is rigidly secured as by projection welding or the like at its upper end to the upper parallel portion of tongue 16f so that it extends downwardly parallel to the lower portion of bracket 16 as shown in Fig. 7. The lower end portion of bimetal strip 16j has a reduced width portion 16k as shown in Fig. 6 so that it extends down freely through the openings between differential bars 30 and 32 as shown in Fig. 10 for reasons hereinafter described. Two pairs of spaced offset bumps 16m and 16n are formed next to the opposite edges of the lower portion of bracket 16 so as to fit with interference snugly into a pair of grooves or channels hereinafter described in the relay housing when the bracket is pressed down thereinto. A rectangular hold 16o is provided in the central lateral portion 16x of bracket 16 for snap in and locking engagement with an integrally formed resilient tooth 2t, Fig. 8, on wall 2n in the relay housing when the bracket is pressed into place. Attachment platform 16e at the upper end of bracket 16 is provided with a threaded hole 16p for receiving a screw 16q, Fig. 2, to attach and electrically connect the connector clip of the cassette heater hereinafter described. As shown in Fig. 7, attachment platform 16e is bent downwardly at a predetermined small angle such as 9.5 degrees or the like toward the heater to automatically set the spacing between the heater and the bimetal strip when the screw is tightened hereinafter more fully described. As shown in Fig. 8, internal wall 2n has integrally molded on the left side thereof, the forward side as seen in Fig. 8, a pair of vertical ridges forming a pair of spaced vertical grooves or channels 2u and 2v facing forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, on opposite sides of integral snap in tooth 2t for receiving the opposite edge portions of bracket 16 whereby formed rounded bumps 16m and 16n provide an interference fit with the opposite sides of these grooves to rigidly secure the bimetal supporting bracket in the housing. As bracket 16 is pressed down into grooves 2u and 2v, resilient plastic tooth 2t will flex and then snap into hole 16o in bracket 16 to permanently lock the bracket in the housing. Similar bracket securing grooves or channels and locking teeth are provided on internal walls 2o and 2p as shown in Fig. 8 for mounting brackets 18 and 20. The vertical ridge defining channel 2v as shown in Fig. 8 has an integral portion of lower height as shown in Fig. 3 extending all the way across compartment 2k to provide a wall 2w the upper surface of which forms a stop for the associated cassette heater 6 when it is assembled into its place on the overload relay. A similar wall 2x is provided in compartment 2m for cassette heater 10. However, in the central compartment 21 the stop wall 2y for the associated cassette heater 8 is formed integrally with and parallel wall 2o to provide a passageway therealong having access to slots 2b in the front wall of the relay shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and slot 2z in the rear wall of the relay housing for ventilation purposes. The upper surface of this wall 2y provides a stop for cassette heater 8 when it is snap in mounted in place as hereinafter described. As shown in Figs. 3, 5 and 13, the relay housing is provided with a snap in hold down member 12 having the integrally molded release button 12a previously referred to in connection with Figs. 1 3. As shown in the isometric view of Fig. 13, this hold down device has a generally inverted U shaped configuration with a pair of legs 12b and 12c and a lateral member 12d connecting the upper ends of the legs. Release button 12a having a generally cylindrical forward end portion extends forwardly from the center of connecting member 12d. Connecting member 12d is generally cylindrical in shape with double width notches 12e and 12f on opposite sides of button 12a and single width notches 12g and 12h at the ends thereof for receiving the pairs of snap in hooks such as 6a and 7a in Fig. 18 of cassette heaters 6, 8 and 10. For this purpose, it will be apparent that the pair of hooks of cassette heater 8 straddle the base of pushbutton 12a and the pairs of hooks of cassette heaters 6 and 10 straddle the thicker portions 12j and 12k at the opposite ends of connecting member 12d, the hooks of cassette heater 6 entering notches 12e and 12g and the hooks of cassette heater 10 entering notches 12f and 12h. These hooks of one cassette heater 6 are shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 18. Since cassette heaters 6, 8 and 10 are alike, the details of only one cassette heater 6 are shown in Figs. 14 and 15 for illustrative purposes. As shown in Fig. 14, housing 6a of cassette heater 6 has a hook 6b integrally molded therewith and cover 7a shown in Fig. 15 has a hook 7b integrally molded therewith, these hooks 6b and 7b being suitably spaced from one another when the cover is assembled on the housing as shown in Fig. 18 to enter the notches of snap in hold down device 12 as hereinbefore described. The snap in hold down device 12 of Fig. 13 is provided with means for mounting the same within relay housing 2 as shown in Fig. 3. For this purpose, the legs 12b and 12c of hold down device 12 are provided with forwardly extending bifurcated snap in securing and locking means or lugs 12m and 12n as shown in Fig. 13 which are inserted into holes 3a and 3b in the front wall of housing 2 as shown in Fig. 2 to lock the hold down device within the relay housing. Each leg 12b and 12c of the hold down device is provided with a pair of lateral rounded ridges 12o and 12p, one of these ridges being at the lower end of the leg and the other ridge being at the knee of the leg, below and above snap in locking device 12n, so as to abut the inner surface of the front wall of the relay housing while snap in locking device 12n holds the leg snugly against the inner wall of the housing. Also, the legs of hold down device 12 are molded so that they are resilient and the upper portion of the hold down device above the knees of the legs extends at a small angle inwardly of the relay housing thereby to provide clearance between the upper portion of the hold down device and the inner wall of the housing for entry of the pairs of hooks of the several cassette heaters. As shown in Fig. 14, the base of housing 6a of the cassette heater 6 has suitable cavities and grooves for accommodating a planar heater element 6c at the upper portion of which is secured as by riveting a connector clip 6d and at the lower left hand portion of which is secured as by riveting a connector 6e. Connector clip 6d is provided with an upper portion 6f that has a screw receiving slot 6g as shown in Fig. 14 and is bent to a predetermined angle such as substantially 80.5 degrees or the like so that it has the same angle with the horizontal as connector platform 16e of the bimetal supporting bracket 16 as shown in Fig. 7 for automatically spacing the heater correctly with respect to the bimetal when the heater is connected to bracket 16. For this purpose, the heater is first pressed down into the relay housing so that its hooks 6b and 7b cam past and snap onto the grip hold down device 12. In this position slotted connector clip 6d overlies tapped hole 16p in connector platform 16e of bracket 16. Then a screw 16q shown in Fig. 2 is dropped into the upper hole 6h shown in Fig. 1 of the heater and turned into the tapped hole in platform 16e. Due to the angle on slotted connector clip 6d which overlies connector platform 16e of the bracket, turning screw 16q tight will tend to draw the connector clip 6d and the heater along with it to a predetermined spacing with the bimetal. As a result of this angle on the connector clips of all three heaters and the like angle on the connector platforms of brackets 16, 18 and 20, all three heaters will tend to be spaced equally and correctly with respect to the respective bimetal elements without requiring any additional adjustments after the heaters have been inserted in place and connected in the circuit with the three screws such as screw 16q shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Figs. 14 and 15, upper hole 6h which receives the connector screw 16q is formed partly in the housing or base 6a and the cover 7a of the heater. The housing 6a and the cover 7a of the heater are also molded so as to provide a hole 6j at the forward midportion thereof as more clearly shown in Fig. 18, when the cover is assembled on the housing and connected thereto by rivets through a pair of aligned holes 6k and 6l, through which a stripped end of a connector wire may be inserted for connection to terminal 6e. For this purpose, terminal 6e is provided with a conventional connector screw 6m having a clamping plate 6n thereon as shown in Fig. 14. To provide access to screw 6m, the housing and cover are molded so as to provide a hole 6x thereabove for entry of a thin screwdriver or the like for turning the screw. Holes 6h and 6x are small enough to prevent entry of the user s finger for safety. As shown in Fig. 16, heater 6c is a thick film heater. This heater comprises a steel plate 6o coated with electrically insulating porcelainized enamel or the like having good heat conductivity to provide a substrate. A thick film heater 6p is then formed on the substrate by applying a thick film resistor paste by screen printing or the like which is then allowed to dry and is fired to form the resistor coating. Thereafter, thick film conductor paste is applied to form contact 6q at the upper end portion of resistor 6p and to form contact 6r at the lower left hand portions of resistor 6p. As shown by the broken line in Fig. 16, conductor paste contacts 6q and 6r partially overlie thick film resistor 6p to make electrical connection therewith. After conductor paste contacts 6q and 6r have been suitably dried and fired, terminal clip 6d and screw terminal 6e are riveted thereover to enable connection of the thick film resistor in the electrical circuit. As will be apparent, use of a thick film resistor on a flat substrate enables making a very small and narrow overall heater package. Also, after the thick film heater has been formed on the substrate, it can be trimmed very accurately along broken line 6s by use of a laser or abrasive trimming such as sand blasting to set its resistance value precisely. This type of heater is designed to withstand a wide range of currents and higher wattage such as 4 watts compared to prior 1 4 watt types. This is an advantage because the currents to which it is subjected are unknown. Moreover, this type of flat heater element using a thick film resistor has an expansion characteristic matched to the substrate for durability. This type of flat, planar heater is much more economical, about 1 8 to 1 10 the cost of a wound wire heater and is more precise and more stable and can be constructed into a smaller flat package thereby enabling the construction of a thermal overload relay having smaller overall dimensions and lighter weight. Thick film heaters are preferably used for currents of 0.1 to 7 amps. An alternative resistance element 40 is shown in Fig. 19. As shown therein, this resistor 40 is stamped from flat resistance material such as copper nickel alloy or the like and is provided with a pair of holes 40a and 40b for riveting a connector clip such as connector clip 6d shown in Fig. 17 to its upper portion and for riveting a connector such as connector 6e shown in Fig. 14 to its lower left hand portion like those used with the thick film heater, or they could be welded. This resistor element 40 is dimensioned to provide the desired total resistance between its two terminals and is preferably used for currents of 7 to 64 amps. The differential operating mechanism shown in Figs. 9 11 will now be described. As shown in Fig. 11, driver bar 30 has the configuration of a generally horizontal slide member 30a with an integral upstanding projection 30b at its left end. Slide portion 30a has a pair of rectangular holes 30c and 30d therethrough with an integral lug 30e at the left side of hole 30c shown in Fig. 10, an integral lug 30f at the left side of hole 30d and an integral lug 30g at the right hand end of driver bar 30 against which the three lower end portions 16k, 18k and 20k of the bimetal strips bear for sliding driver bar 30 in the left hand direction when one or more of the bimetals deflects under thermal conditions. The upper end of upstanding projection 30b of driver bar 30 has a hole for journaling lower pivot pin 28a of crank 28. Follower bar 32 shown in Fig. 11 also has a generally flat horizontal slider portion 32a that also has two holes 32b and 32c therethrough and a slot 32d at its left end. Lugs 32e and 32f are integrally molded on the right hand sides of holes 32b and 32c as shown in Fig. 11 and a similar lug 32g shown in Fig. 10 is provided on the right hand side of slot 32d against which the lower end portions 16k, 18k and 20k of the respective bimetal strips bear to move follower bar 32 in the right hand direction under cooling conditions or for restraining leftward sliding movement of follower bar 32 by one or more of the bimetal elements when one or more of the other bimetal elements deflects in the left hand direction for differential action. The left hand end portion of follower bar 32 has an upstanding projection 32h with a hole 32i therethrough for receiving and journaling upper pivot pin 28b of crank 28. Plastic molded crank 28 also has an upstanding actuator projection 28c covered by a sleeve of resilient plastic material 28d or the like for applying a force on switch actuator 26 as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. A snap in cover 42 shown in Figs. 3, 9 and 10 closes a hole in the bottom of relay housing 2 through which the driver and follower bars and crank are inserted and provides a surface on which driver bar 30 slides, groove 42a in the upper surface thereof providing clearance for the lower tips of the bimetal strips. The operation of driver bar 30, crank 28 and follower bar 32 will now be described. First, let it be assumed that all three bimetals respond to an increasing temperature, either increasing ambient temperature or increasing temperature due to current flowing through the associated heater elements or both. This will cause the lower ends of the bimetal elements to deflect toward the switch side of the thermal overload relay. This direction of deflection is in the left hand direction as viewed in Figs. 7, 9 and 10 where the relay is being viewed from the back side and in the right hand direction when viewed from the front as in Fig. 2. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, lower legs 16c and 16d of bracket 16 are wide enough apart to provide clearance therebetween for bimetal element 16j if this bimetal element deflects that far under severe overload conditions. Such deflection of the bimetal elements will slide driver bar 30 in the left hand direction in Fig. 10. As a result, driver bar 30 will rotate crank 28 in a clockwise direction just enough so that actuator projection 28c, 28d thereof will abut switch actuator 26 but will not actually depress it because follower bar 32 is free to move also in the left hand direction. Whenever the ambient temperature increases, compensating bimetal member 24 shown in Fig. 10 correspondingly deflects in the left hand direction an equal amount as the deflection of bimetal members 16j, 18j and 20j due only to ambient temperature increase. However, the latter three bimetal members deflect further in the left hand direction due to overload current flowing through the associated heaters so that eventually forward projection 32j of follower bar 32 abuts compensating bimetal member 24 which stops the leftward movement of this follower bar. Further movement of driver bar 30 then causes clockwise rotation of crank 28 in Fig. 10 so that operating projection 28c, 28d thereof depresses switch actuator 26 to trip the switch open. Thereafter, the three bimetal members will cool and deflect back in the right hand direction as seen in Fig. 10 carrying follower bar 32 therewith. Since driver bar 30 is coupled through crank 28 to the follower bar, driver bar 30 will also slide back in the right hand direction. Switch 4 may be reset by depressing reset button 14 to reclose the contacts. The left to right position of compensating bimetal member 24 may be adjusted at factory adjustment screw 4h and customer trip current selector 4i, Figs. 1 and 20, to set the current level at which the overload rely will trip. Switch 4 may be similar to that shown in the aforementioned patent 4,096,465, or F. N. Woodger patent 3,800,260, dated March 26, 1974. Let it now be assumed that there is a differential in the currents flowing in the several phases of the system. For example, this could cause one of the bimetal members to deflect more than another one. As a result, the deflecting bimetal member will move driver bar 30 in the left hand direction while the other bimetal member that does not deflect as much will restrain follower bar 32 from moving an equal distance. This differential in the movements of driver bar 30 and follower bar 32 will cause crank 28 to rotate in the clockwise direction in Fig. 10 to trip the switch. The current differential in two of the phases at which the switch will trip is determined by the dimensions of the driver and follower bars and the points of coupling of crank 28 thereto. Conductors 16h, 18h, and 20h at the rear of the overload relay are given a length such that when lug 20c at the rear of the overload relay is coupled to a contactor or the like, these conductors will automatically extend into the terminals of the contactor whereupon the terminal screws can be tightened to electrically connect the overload relay to the contactor. Stripped end conductors from the electrical supply may then be inserted into the front holes such as 6j, Fig. 18, to connect the three heaters to the electrical supply, the contactor being connected through a load to the other side of the supply. Thus, when there is an overload condition on the line, switch 4 will trip and de energize the contactor to open the circuit to the load and protect the same. Referring again to Fig. 7, it will be apparent that the 9.5 degree slope at the top of bracket 16 provides an advantage in packaging in that the heaters can then be installed and removed in any sequence but it also affords an advantage in bimetal alignment with respect to the associated heater when an electrical screw connection is made between the thin terminal clip 6f at the top of the heater and the bracket platform 16e as a result of which the angle will tend to snug the heater over next to the bimetal and will set the dimension between the bimetal and the heater surface so that the dimensions of all three heater bimetal combinations will be the same. This automatic adjustment of the spacing between the bimetal and the heater comes about because, due to the slope of the platform and the terminal clip, as the screw is tightened there will be a component of force tending to move the heater in the direction of the bimetal against a stop when the vertical portion of the connector clip or its rivet abuts the bracket. On the other hand, if the angle were set at 90 degrees, there would be no similar force tending to align the heater with the bimetal or to set the spacing and the spacings in the several phases could differ. Also, bracket 16 shown in Fig. 6 and brackets 18 and 20 which are similar to it are designed to provide several advantages. For this purpose, it will be apparent that the current enters platform 16e where it enters from the associated heater and then the current splits in two and flows down the two outside arms 16a and 16b above lateral strip 16g and then through lateral strip 16g into lead 16h. During short circuit conditions, the current here is split so as to lessen the magnetic effects. It will be apparent that the hop spot in the entire structure is the center of the heater. If platform 16e were connected directly to the contactor, there would be a high heat loss out that back terminal and the overload relay would actually be heating the contactor with the overload current. By forcing the current to flow through this terminal 16e and to cycle partly through the bracket again before it is passed to the contactor, it is possible to use a part of this bracket as a heat sink, thus reducing the effect of heating a contactor. The arms 16a and 16b below the lateral strip 16g where lead 16h is welded are provided for flexibility. If wire 16h is moved to one side or the other or is pulled on, this structure will prevent the bimetal from moving thereby providing a mechanical flexing joint. Also, when the screw is tightened on platform 16e, this structure prevents disturbing of the bimetal position because the two outside edges of the legs of the bracket 16 are rigidly supported in the housing so that even though arms 16a and 16b should flex, the bimetal will remain in its position. This provides a mechanical advantage. The space between the heater and the bimetal is about 0.62mm. In fig. 20, rivets 4f and 4g hold the cover to the base or housing of the switch. Screw 4h and selector 4i, Figs. 1 and 20, are used to set the current level at which the switch will trip by setting the position of compensating bimetal 24. And mechanism 4j at the top of the switch is used to select the mode of operation for reset lever 14. While the apparatus hereinbefore described is effectively adapted to fulfill the objects stated, it is to be understood that the invention is not intended to be confined to the particular preferred embodiment of reduced sized thermal overload relay disclosed, inasmuch as it is susceptible of various modifications without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
