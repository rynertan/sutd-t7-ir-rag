# Method and apparatus for determining and imaging fats in biological samples.

## Abstract
A method of determining or imaging fats in a non ¹³C en riched biological sample, particularly human tissue comprising subjecting the sample to a magnetic field, irradiating the sam ple with radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, obtaining from the sample an electrical signal indicative of the radiofre quency absorption of the sample in the magnetic field at a fre quency corresponding to the ¹³C NMR resonance frequency for CH₂ The method is useful in the diagnosis of certain fat relat ed diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. Apparatus for carrying out the method may comprise a support for the patient.
