# Josephson logic integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A Josephson logic integrated circuit packaged on a single substrate, wherein a portion 301a, 301b for delivering an output out of the integrated circuit is constructed of an A.C. driven Josephson logic circuit, and a portion 200a, 300b, 300c for driving the interanal part of the integrated circuit is constructed of a D.C. driven Josephson logic circuit.
