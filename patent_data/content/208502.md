# Light sensitive silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a light sensitive silver halide color photo graphic material in which a DIR compound capable of releas ing a diffusible development inhibitor or precursor thereof by the reaction with an oxidized form of a color developing agent is employed in combination with a non diffusible dye and which sastisfies Condition A and B recited in the specification. By using the color light sensitive material according to the present invention, the sharpness, particularly the edge ef fect including the fringe effect and the border effect of a photographic image has been greatly improved.
