# Turbo machine blading.

## Abstract
Turbo machine blading in which each blade 16 of a blade wheel 12 has a platform section 18 at its inner end and a shroud segment 38 at its outer end, opposite ends of the shroud segment 38 being formed with S shaped machined end surfaces 44, 46 each including a plane circumferentially extending abutment surface 48, 50 . Oppositely facing abutment surfaces 48, 50 of adjacent blades 16 engage one another in a transverse radial plane P P and provide frictional damping of circumferential blade vibrations as well as restraining the centrifugal untwisting of the spanwise twisted blades 16 by counterbalancing the untwisting torques T . The remaining portions of the opposed end surfaces 44, 46 of adjacent blades are separated by clearance space. The inward projection of the end surfaces 44, 46 of each blade do not intersect the platform section 18 of the blade so that these end surfaces can be machined simultaneously by a pair of spaced tools moved along a line of action which takes them past the platform section 18 without touching it, thus avoiding tool reversal. Each blade is provided with three conical locating protrusions 52, 54, 56 for locating the blade in a fixture for machining.
