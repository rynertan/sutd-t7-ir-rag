# Optical to optical image transducer capable of accepting x radiation.

## Abstract
A device 30 and method for converting an X ray image into a corresponding output image with light fron a different source and a phosphorescent layer 34 in conjunction with a liquid crystal light valve 12, 16, 18, 18, 24, 32 . The light valve includes a photosensor layer 32 comprised of a deposited semiconductor material having distinct light and dark photoconductivities, the light photoconductivity being substantially greater than the dark photoconductivity. When impinged upon by an particular pattern of X rays, the phosphorescent layer 32 phosphoresces in a corressponding pattern, which phosphorescence in turn causes the semiconductor layer 32 to be switched to its light photoconductivity in a pattern also corresponding to that of the input X ray image. The pattern of switched semiconductor in the photosensor layer allows a biasing voltage to be switched over to the liquid crystal layer of the light valve in a corresponding pattern. This voltage pushes the liquid crystal over its electro optic threshold thereby inducing an output image corresponding to the original input image.
