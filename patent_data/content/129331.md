# STRAIN GAUGED TRANSDUCERS

## Abstract
A strain transducer is adapted to measure strain at a chosen depth below the surface of a workpiece, such as at the neutral axis of a draft bar. The transducer has a hollow cylin drical plug 6 projecting from a co axial shoulder 7 of slightly larger diameter, the distal end of the plug being force fitted with a disc like diaphragm 9 on which strain gauges 10 are mounted. These are on the inside face, and connec tions 11 extend up inside the plug to encapsulated electronic circuitry at the proximal end. The workpiece is bored 3 to an extent greater than the chosen depth and then counterbored 4 to match the plug and shoulder, and the transducer is inserted with an interference fit.
