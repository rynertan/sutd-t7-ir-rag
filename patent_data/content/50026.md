# SHOE UPPER CONFORMING MACHINE

## Abstract
Shoe upper conforming machine for use in side lasting shoe uppers using lasting rollers which operate progressive ly along opposite side portions of the shoe has a facility for varying the speed of relative movement between the shoe support and the side lasting instrumentalities. To this end two preset speeds slow and fast are available and either the operator can select which speed, using a manually operable switch, or, by selecting an automatic cycle, the speed can be automatically switched during the machine cycle. In particular, it has been found desirable that, with certain styles of shoe the speed of traverse is reduced in the joint region of the shoe bottom. Where adhesive applying nozzles are also provided, if desired the rate of flow of adhesive can be similarly controlled viz. by selecting from two pre settings .
