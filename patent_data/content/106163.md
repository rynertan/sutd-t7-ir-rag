# 8 Phase phase shift keying demodulator.

## Abstract
A demodulator features a circuit wherein a signal to effect carrier recovery and elimination of intersymbol inter ference etc. is produced by digitizing and processing demod ulated signals in a manner that in the case of phase deviations due to noise or the like, the deviations fall within zones having predetermined digital identifications enabling the generation of appropriate digital correction signals via which the above mentioned signal production is controlled.
