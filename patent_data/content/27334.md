# METHOD OF FABRICATING HEAT MIRROR FOR INCANDESCENT LAMP ENVELOPE AND RESULTING PRODUCT

## Abstract
Energy conserving incandescent lamp wherein the envelope has provided on the interior surface thereof a very efficient and economically applied heat mirror which is highly transmissive for visible radiations and highly reflective for infrared radiations, thereby to enhance the conversion of elec tric energy to visible energy. The heat mirror coating com prises a two layer Ag TiO₂ or a three layer TiO₂ Ag TiO₂ coating of predetermined thickness. The three layer coating is formed by first applying to the envelope interior surface a thin layer of clear aliphatic alcohol solution having contained therein partially hydrolyzed metallic alkoxide which substan tially comprises titanium alkoxide, and which solution con tains at most only a limited amount of selected mineral acid. The applied clear solution layer is heat treated to convert same to a thin continuous layer substantially comprising titania. A thin silver layer is applied over the first applied titania coating, preferably by vacuum metallizing, and a sec ond thin layer of solution containing the partially hydrolyzed metallic alkoxide which substantially comprises titanium alkoxide is applied over the silver layer. Thereafter the applied second layer is heat treated to convert same to titania, with the heat treating temperatures and atmospheres controlled so as not to affect the applied silver layer. The two layer coating is applied by omitting the first TiO₂ coating step.
