# Curable physical mixtures and composites therefrom.

## Abstract
Described herein is a curable physical mixture compris ing a an active hydrogen containing compound selected from a polyol, a polyamine, an amino alcohol, or mixtures thereof, b an unsaturated carboxylic anhydride, and c an ethylenically unsaturated monomer. These mixtures are cured to give a thermoset crosslinked composition.
