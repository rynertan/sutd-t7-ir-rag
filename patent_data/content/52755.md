# Text processing system generating multiple virtual displays on a single display screen.

## Abstract
System for generating multiple virtual displays on a single display screen by a display access method DAM program 80 running interrupt identified service programs. Each of the service programs 72, 82, 98 and 118 is provided with stack memory elements 74, 84, 100 and 120 for retaining data to run the program. Each of the service programs 72, 82, 98 and 118 is run by the DAM program 80 in accordance with priority interrupts with a higher priority interrupt having immediate access to the DAM program 80 . A service program having a low priority interrupt that is being run will be stopped by the ocurrence of a higher priority interrupt with the data and address information of the interrupted program retained in the stack in memory elements 74, 84, 100 and 120 . The service program of the higher priority interrupt is then run and when ended the DAM program 80 retrieves the data for the lower priority program to return to the point of interruption.
