# Electrostatographic development process.

## Abstract
A process for causing the development of electrostatic latent images on an imaging member comprises providing a development zone situated between a tensioned flexible imaging member 1 and a transporting member 4 , adding conductive developer particles to the development zone comprised of toner particles 2 and conductive magnetic carrier particles 3 , causing the imaging member to move at a speed of from 50 to 800 mm sec, causing the transporting member to move at a speed of from 60 mm s to 1.6 m sec, said flexible member and said transporting member moving at different speeds, maintaining a distance between the imaging member and the transporting member of from 0.05 millimeters to 1.5 millimeters, introducing a high electric field in the developrnent zone, wherein the developer particles contained in the development zone are agitated, thereby providing contact between the conductive carrier particles, causing charge to rapidly flow in the direction of the deflected imaging member, said process being accom plished in the presence of a low magnetic field of less than 0.015T.
