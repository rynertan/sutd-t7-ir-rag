# A static memory circuit.

## Abstract
A static memory circuit comprising memory cells arranged in a matrix of word lines and bit lines, a reset circuit for resetting each pair of bit lines to habe an equivalent potential in responce to a charge of a row address signal, the reset circuit having a constitution to generate a reset signal at a first time a certain time period after a first change of the row address signal and to terminate the reset signal at a second time before a second change, followed by the first change, of the row address signal, whereby data destruciton during reading is prevented.
