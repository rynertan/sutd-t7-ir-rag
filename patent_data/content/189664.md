# LINE EXPOSURE ARRAY

## Abstract
A line exposure array of light emitting diodes 26a, 26b arranged in spaced apart relationship with respect to each other in a line A A is described. The array is geometrically configured to provide a substantially uniform exposure of a photosensitive material without underexposed stripes appearing on those areas of the photosensitive material immediately adjacent the spaces between the light emitting diodes.
