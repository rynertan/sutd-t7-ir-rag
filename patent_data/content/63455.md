# Method for the fabrication of encapsulated chemoresponsive microelectronic device arrays.

## Abstract
The invention provides a chemical responsive field effect transducer operating in depletion mode, or enhance ment depletion mode, comprising a semiconductor mate rial having a pair of adjacent diffusion regions 1, 2 of a certain doping polarity located at the surface and separated by a channel 3 of the same doping polarity, said channel being created by diffusion, ion implantation, epitaxial growth, or creation of a surface inversion layer by controlled processing techniques or other means. The diffusion regions and channel region are supported by an insulating substrate 4 or semiconductor substrate of opposite polarity. Electrical insulator 6 and or ion barrier material 7 overlies the aforementioned channel region. An electroactive material 10 overlies said insulator and or ion barrier, such that the electroactive material will interact with substances to which it is exposed and control the charge carrier density in the aforementioned channel. Such devices form the basis of a variety of assemblies, including flow injection analysis sensors, and flow through cuvettes suitable for the continuous or intermittent on line monitoring of blood, ex vivo, in the clinical environment.
