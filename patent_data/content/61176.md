# Multicolor jet printing.

## Abstract
A method is provided for jet printing in a plurality of colors on a substrate which is coated with one component of a dye. The jet printing nozzles 21, 22, 23 direct droplets of liquid to the substrate 10 containing the complementary dye components which produce a finished dye at the points of impact of the liquid onto the substrates. Different jet printing nozzles utilize different complementary dye compo nents on the same substrate, producing different dyes and thereby different colors.
