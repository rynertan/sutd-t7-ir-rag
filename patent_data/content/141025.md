# Storage stable one component urethane compounds and method for making and using same.

## Abstract
A storage stable one component air curable urethane coating composition having improved color and abrasion resistance comprising at least twenty percent by weight or resin solids of a compound comprising at least one oxazolidine ring chemically combined from the nitrogen atom of the ring through an alkylene urethane linking group to an isophorone diisocyanate prepolymer radical. The invention also comprises the method for preparing the compound and composition and a method for coating a surface by applying the composition of the invention to the surface and exposing the applied composition to air having a relative humidity of at least 10 and includes an article coated with the cured composition.
