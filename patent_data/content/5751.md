# Hyaluronidase and its production.

## Abstract
Hyaluronidase BMP 8231 having the characteristics of a Type of Action Endo Î² hexosaminidase, b Substrate Specificity Degradable Hyaluronic acid, Not degradable Chondroitin sulfate A, Chondroitin sulfate C and Chondroitin, c Optimum pH Around pH4.0, d Stable pH range pH4.0 pH11.3, e Optimum temperature Around 60 C and f Stable temperature range Below 60 C. The invention also relates to a process for preparing hyaluronidase BMP 8231 by culturing a hyaluronidase BMP 8231 producing strain belonging to the genus Streptomyces, particularly Streptomyces koganeiensis ATCC 31394. Hyaluronidase BMP 8231 is a new enzyme having improved properties in comparison with known hyaluronidase enzyms.
