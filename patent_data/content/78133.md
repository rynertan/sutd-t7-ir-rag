# Belt conveyor having article sorting and orienting features.

## Abstract
Belt conveyor 2 comprises first 22 and second 24 endless belts in side by side relationship which move in opposite directions. Articles 4 are loaded onto the first belt 22 at its first end 26 . The articles 4 may be in either of two stable attitudes. A sorting guide 60 pushes articles 4 in the second stable attitude onto the second belt 24 . The articles pushed are then transferred laterally to the first end 26 of the first belt and the attitudes of the articles transferred are changed so that they are then in the first stable attitude. Articles which pass the sorting guide 60 are guided to the second end 28 of the first belt 22 , transferred to the second end 48 of the second belt 24 , and then transported to a discharge station 138 at the first end 46 of the second belt 24 . These articles 4 are reoriented during travel on the second belt 24 so that they are all in the first stable attitude and in a preferred specific orientation.
