## Abstract
Enhanced antiulcer activity is obtained in warm blooded animals by the concomitant administration of the histamine Hâ‚‚ receptor antagonist, etintidine, and the pepsin complex ing agent, pepstatin. Concomitant administration of the two entities reduces the amount of etintidine necessary for effective treatment, thereby decreasing its side effect lia bility.
