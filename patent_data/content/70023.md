# Process for producing water insoluble polymers of uniform shape.

## Abstract
A process for producing a water insoluble polymer of uniform shape having high strength and a desired geometric form is disclosed. This process comprises the steps of dissolving or partially suspending in water a a water soluble salt of alginic acid, b a hydrophilic, crosslinkable vinyl monomer having two or more radical polymerizable vinyl groups per molecule, and c optionally a hydrophilic, radical polymerizable vinyl monomer bringing the resulting aqueous solution or suspension into contact with an aqueous solution capable of causing gelation of the water soluble salt of alginic acid and thereby forming an water insoluble gel of uniform shape and subjecting the gel to radical polymerization to produce a water insoluble polymer.
