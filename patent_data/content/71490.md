# Improvements relating to continuous extrusion apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for continuous extrusion of metals in which feed is introduced into a circumferential groove 26 in a rotating wheel 2 to contact arcuate tooling 22 and an abutment 24. The abutment 4 is spaced from the walls of the groove 26 so that in operation a lining of the feed material is produced. Indentations 52 assist in holding the lining in place. The extrusion is generally in a radial direction through an aperture 58. The extrusion orifices not shown may be of part annular cross section of different area. The extrusion aperture may extend from outside the groove 26 to permit of increased orifice area.
