# SYNTHETIC VACCINES

## Abstract
A method is provided for the priming of physiological systems against infection by viruses which comprises admi nistering to said system, prior to viral infection, an amino acid sequence selected from a hydrophilic region of the surface of the said virus. While the administration of said amino acid sequence may not cause the formation of neutralizing antibodies against said virus such neutralizing antibodies are formed upon the introduction of said virus into said system.
