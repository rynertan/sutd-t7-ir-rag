## Description
This invention relates to cabinet structures and, more particularly, to a vanity cabinet incorporating a folding mirror panel which, in the preferred embodiment, may be associated with lights for illumination. Various types of vanity cabinet structures have been used over the years. Many have included folding tops or covers which may be raised to reveal a mirror positioned for viewing when a person is positioned in front of the cabinet. Prior known vanity cabinet structures have, however, suffered from numerous deficiencies making them undesirable from various standpoints. For instance, toilet cabinets are shown in US A 1 062 962 and US A 1 443 858 in which pivotable top covers are raised to expose mirrors for viewing. In US A 1 062 962, a pivoted mirror is hinged to the rear of a slide out drawer. The drawer must be pulled out to its full extent before the mirror is properly positioned for viewing. In US A 1 443 858, on the other hand, a mirror is combined with a storage cabinet such that, when a tilted receptacle is swung outwardly toward the front of the cabinet, a pair of pivoted links are moved upwardly and outwardly to both raise a top cover and swing a hinged mirror outwardly to a viewing position at the top of the cabinet. In both of these constructions, however, use of the mirror for viewing is severely limited, especially for close up viewing, since the sliding drawers or pivoted storage areas prevent close approach to the viewing surface. Moreover, it would be virtually impossible to remain seated in front of one of these structures when the drawer or pivoted storage cabinet is operated. Other vanity cabinets as shown in US A 1 497 379 and US A 1 667 564 have been proposed for use as either freestanding or separate storage structures. In US A 1 497 379, for instance, a manually pivotable cover on a freestanding combination table may be raised to a rearwardly slanted position after which a separate hinged mirror panel may be pivoted upwardly to rest against the cover panel and hold the cover in its raised position. In US A 1 667 564, a cover is provided on a box structure which includes a slide out drawer. The cover may be opened for use as a storage structure and includes a hinged panel having a mirror thereon. The mirror may be manually pivoted to a generally upright position to support the box like cover. Once again, use of the structure described in US A 1 667 564 from close in front is difficult when the drawer structure is slid outwardly. Also, the mirror itself must be repositioned each time the box like cover is raised in order to provide a proper viewing angle for the mirror. In the structure shown in US A 1 497 379, the mirror panel may be supported in only two positions and is located near the rear of the cabinet making close up viewing difficult because of the protrusion of the front of the cabinet. Moreover, with both of these structures, use of the cabinet is cumbersome because multiple operations to properly position the mirror are required. In addition, neither mirror is automatically positioned as desired. Other variations of vanity cabinets are shown in US A 2 758 900 and US A 2 863 709. The cabinet shown in the first of these is a complex structure using pressurized cylinders and a heavy bracket assembly to pivot a cover having a mirror mounted on its underside to a raised position. Not only is the structure expensive, but is quite complex and requires the cylinders for efficient operation. In US A 2 863 709, a simple hinged cover with a mirror panel thereon is combined with a bathroom table and hamper structure. The cover may be supported in only one raised position, again at the back of the cabinet making close up viewing difficult. Also, with both of these structures, the mirror panel is not adjustable to different positions making use by persons of different heights quite difficult. Flexibility of use of all of the above structures is limited as well because none of these prior structures are designed for ease of insertion as prebuilt units in modern, prebuilt cabinets wherein on site assembly is made by securing together the prebuilt units followed by covering with a continuous, one piece countertop. Moreover, the prior known cabinets were also not adapted for easy insertion in custom, site built cabinetry. US 3381120 discloses a travel case with a mirror assemblage stored in one position within its lid. The mirror assemblage is pivotally secured to the front of the lid and is held in place by a latch. When this latch is released, it is possible to pivot the mirror assemblage out of the lid and to extend two legs from the mirror assemblage for supporting the lid and assemblage on the case. Several steps are required to bring the mirror into a suitable viewing position. US 3381120 discloses those features set out in the precharacterising portions of the independent claims. The present invention is designed to overcome the problems with prior known vanity cabinets such as those noted above. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a vanity cabinet comprising a bottom panel an upstanding rear panel supported on the bottom panel a cover panel cover mounting means for pivotally mounting the cover panel to the rear panel for movement between raised and lowered positions in overlying relationship to the bottom panel a front support for the cover panel at the front of the bottom panel a mirror and mirror mounting means for pivotally supporting the mirror on the undersurface of the cover panel at a first position adjacent the front of the cover panel characterised by support means extending from the mirror mounting means at a second position spaced from the first position for supporting the mirror mounting means and mirror above the bottom panel when the cover panel is lowered and in an upright position when the cover panel is raised and bearing means on the support means for engaging and movably supporting the mirror mounting means on and along the bottom panel, the bearing means engaging the front support when the cover panel is raised to support the cover panel and mirror mounting means in the upright position when the cover panel is raised whereby when the cover panel is pivoted upwardly, the mirror mounting means and support means will automatically pivot downwardly and outwardly away from the cover panel on the bearing means along the bottom panel to position the mirror for viewing. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a panel assembly for a vanity cabinet comprising a vanity panel adapted to be pivotally secured at a first position to the undersurface of a pivotable cover and over an underlying panel a mirror support panel hinge means for pivotally securing the mirror support panel to said vanity panel a mirror secured to said mirror support panel characterised by adjustment means for selectively positioning said mirror support panel at a predetermined angular position with respect to said vanity panel and support means extending from the vanity panel at a second position spaced from the first position for supporting the vanity panel and mirror above the underlying panel when the cover is lowered and in an upright position when the cover is raised the support means allowing automatic movement of the vanity panel from the lowered to the upright position for viewing of the mirror. Various additional features are set out in the subsidiary claims and may be combined in various ways with, or substituted for features of, the invention according to its aspects set out above. However, certain preferred but not necessarily essential features of the invention will now be discussed in general terms. This invention includes a vanity cabinet providing for automatic unfolding and positioning of a mirror when a pivoted cover is raised. The mirror may be designed for retention in a preselected, generally constant viewing position which remains essentially unchanged regardless of whether the cover is raised or lowered. Adjustment of the mirror for repeated viewing use by the same person may be, therefore, generally unnecessary. However, the invention does allow mirror adjustment to accommodate different sized persons and or different chair heights. The present invention may also provide thorough, high quality lighting via light panels adjacent the mirror. The lights may be controlled by a switch structure connected to an electrical source by wiring which is hidden from view from the front of the cabinet. Provision for storage of toilet and other articles adjacent the folding mirror may be included, while the entire vanity cabinet may be designed for ease in operation and incorporating in existing or new prebuilt or site built, built in cabinets as well as being adaptable for use as a freestanding unit. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vanity cabinet includes a bottom panel, an upstanding rear panel on the bottom panel and a cover panel having undersurface, front and rear portions. The cover panel is pivotally mounted to the rear panel for movement between a raised and lowered position in overlying relationship to the bottom panel. Further, a mirror is mounted on a vanity panel. A first positioning structure is included for automatically pivoting the vanity panel and mirror with respect to the cover panel from a folded, substantially horizontal, lowered position to an upright position in which the mirror may be used for viewing when the cover panel is lifted. Also included is a second positioning structure for selectively positioning the mirror at a predetermined angular position with respect to the vanity panel. The angular position of the mirror remains generally constant unless purposely reset regardless of whether the cover is raised or lowered. In another form of the invention, the mirror is pivotally mounted on the undersurface of the cover panel adjacent the front of the cover panel. Bearing assemblies are provided on the mirror mounting structure for movably supporting the mirror mounting structure on and along the bottom panel. Thus, when the cover panel is pivoted upwardly, the mirror mounting structure will automatically pivot downwardly and outwardly away from the cover panel on the bearing assemblies to position the mirror for viewing. Preferably the panel assembly for a vanity cabinet is provided including a generally planar vanity panel adapted to be pivotally secured to the underside of a pivotable cover, a mirror support panel, a hinge for pivotally securing the mirror support panel to the vanity panel, and a mirror secured to the mirror support panel. Adjustable structure is provided for selectively positioning the mirror support panel at a predetermined angular position with respect to the vanity panel. In addition, a movable support is provided on the vanity panel for movably supporting the vanity panel over and along an underlying panel to allow automatic movement of the vanity panel to an upright position for viewing of the mirror when the vanity panel is pivotally secured beneath a pivotable cover. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an adjustable bracket is secured between the mirror panel and vanity panel provide for selective positioning of the mirror regardless of the raised or lower position of the cover panel. Lighting panels may also be provided extending generally vertically alongside the mirror panel in other embodiments of the invention. Further, storage areas may be provided adjacent the folding mirror structure within the cabinet. Also, a front panel which supports the cover panel when in lowered position may be provided with a decorative front to match adjoining cabinetry decor. As will be understood, the present invention provides significant advantages over prior known vanity cabinets. First, the invention provides automatically correct positioning of the mirror upon opening. The angular viewing position of the mirror may be preset and remains essentially unchanged even when the cabinet is closed. This avoids any need for readjustment each time the cabinet is opened should the same person desire to use it. However, persons of different size will find the cabinet easily and quickly adjustable to their particular viewing position. A person can sit close to the front of the cabinet immediately adjacent the mirror panel which is supported immediately adjacent the front of the cabinet in viewing position. In addition, the mechanism for unfolding the mirror when the cover is raised is safe, sure, reliable and uncomplicated thereby assuring ease of operation by anyone. Moreover, the invention may provide thorough lighting regardless of the position of the cabinet within a room or the strength of the surrounding ambient lighting in a room. Also, while preferable providing space for additional storage within the cabinet, the invention fits unobtrusively within premanufactured or site built cabinets or countertops, or may be separately supported as a table or desk to provide an aesthetically pleasing addition to any room. When the separate panel assembly of the present invention is provided, various other countertops and cabinets can be converted to vanity cabinets by attaching the panel assembly beneath a pivotable cover and over an underlying panel such that operation will occur as described herein. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways but two vanity cabinets embodying the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, Figures 1 to 7 illustrate a first vanity cabinet 10 designed for use either in a continuous countertop structure or as a freestanding unit supported on separate side panels or the like. Figures 1 to 7 show the cabinet broken out of a built in cabinet with continuous countertop applied. The vanity cabinet includes two major portions including a cabinet assembly 12 and a mirror panel assembly 40. The cabinet 12 has a rectangular, generally planar, pivotable cover panel 14 beneath which the mirror panel assembly 40 is pivotally secured for automatic unfolding. The mirror panel assembly 40 swings outwardly into position adjacent to the front of the cabinet 12 to allow viewing in the mirror when the cover panel 14 is raised as shown in Figures 2 to 4. As is best seen in Figures 1, 2 and 4 to 6, the cabinet assembly 12 includes a rectangular bottom panel 16, a vertical or upstanding, rectangular rear panel 18, a vertical or upstanding, rectangular front panel 20 which may include decorative panel portions 22 thereon, and a top panel 23 Figures 1 and 2 . Front and rear panels 18, 20 are generally longer than they are high such that the overall cabinet is longer and wider than its height. The top panel 23 is formed by a rear strip member 25 and countertop side pieces 24 which abut the side edges of strip member 25 as applied in the field upon installation. A continuous laminated plastic sheet or other covering is then applied over member 25 and pieces 24 to hide the joints between these pieces. The top panel includes a rectangular opening 27 therein for receipt of the cover panel 14. Each of panels 14 to 25 is generally planar and may be formed from wood or particle board covered with a plastic laminate sheeting, a synthetic countertop material, a wood veneer, or other finishes as desired. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, however, the preferred construction 10 incorporates particle or chip board or wood covered with a plastic laminate sheeting or veneer. The rear panel 18 is recessed into the top surface of the bottom panel 16 Figure 5 . The side pieces 24 and rear strip 25 of the top panel 23 are secured to the upper, parallel edges of the front and rear panels 18, 20. The front panel 20 has a somewhat greater height than the rear panel in order to extend below the bottom panel 16. The lower extension of the front panel 20 serves to substantially hide from view wooden or other securing strips 26, 28 from the front. Strips 26, 28 are secured to the bottom surface of the bottom panel 16 at the sides and rear and allow insertion of screws or other fasteners therethrough to attach the cabinet 10 between adjacent lavatory, desk or built in cabinets or separate side panels. As shown in Figure 6, a preferred method for securing the cabinet assembly 10 is through the use of screws extending through the strips 26 and into vertically extending side panels 29 already existing in the cabinet structure. As will also be seen from Figures 1, 4 and 5, the upper edge of rear panel 18 is slightly higher than that of front panel 20. This allows a separate strip member 30 to be secured beneath the front of cover 14 such that a plastic laminate, veneer or the like may be applied to a double thickness of cover 14 along its front edge for aesthetic purposes to match the thickness of an adjoining countertop edge. The strip 30 also serves as a convenient handhold for lifting the cover 14 as will be explained below. A handle not shown , such as the one which matches the other handles on the cabinet structure in which the vanity cabinet is installed, may be secured to the front edge of the cover 14 to aid in lifting and lowering the cover. Typically, when the invention is provided as a complete vanity cabinet, the cover 14 is provided longer than its final length as shown at 31 in Figures 4, 5 and 8. The extending portion is cut off in the field for alignment with the adjacent countertop and secured under the front edge of the cover as strip 30 after which a plastic laminate or other veneer may be applied to the front surface. Securing of the various panels in the assembly may be made by screws, nails, adhesives and the like as is conventionally known in the cabinet industry. The cover 14 is attached to the cabinet 10 for pivotal movement between a lowered position, in which it is parallel to the bottom panel 16 Figure 1 , and a raised position in which it extends out of the opening 26 at an acute angle to the top 24 Figure 2 . A preferred method for pivotally securing the cover 14 to the cabinet is shown in Figures 1 to 7 and includes a pair of upstanding wooden or other blocks 32 secured by screws, adhesive or the like to the inside surface of the rear panel 18 adjacent the outer portions of the opening 27. The blocks 32 also help support the rear of the top panel 24. On the inside surfaces of the blocks 32 are secured a pair of furniture hinges 34 which extend into the interior of the cabinet and are attached to the undersurface of the cover 14 at positions spaced from the rear edge of the cover 14 as shown in Figures 4 and 5. Thus, when the front edge of the cover 14 is lifted, the rear edge of the cover will pivot downwardly away from the rear strip 25 of the top panel 23 on the hinges 34 as is best seen in Figure 4. A wiring aperture 36 extends through the thickness of the bottom panel 16 in order to allow wiring access to the interior of the cabinet as will be explained more fully below. As mentioned, the mirror panel assembly 40 is designed for attachment to the undersurface of the cover 14 such that the assembly operates within the interior of the cabinet 12 to provide a mirror in viewing position when the cover 14 is raised as shown in Figure 2. The mirror panel assembly 40 includes a generally planar, rectangular vanity panel or back member 42 having secured at its upper end a pair of spaced, loose pin hinges 44. The hinges 44 are attached to the front edge of a wood or other strip member 46 extending across the undersurface of the cover 14 at a position spaced slightly rearwardly from the front strip member 30 as shown in Figures 4 and 5. At the lower or opposite end of the vanity panel 42 from hinges 44 is secured a generally rectangular, planar, end panel or flange 48 extending at a right angle to the vanity panel 42. The panel 48 extends downwardly toward the bottom panel 16 and includes an end edge adjacent which roller assemblies 50 are mounted at spaced positions at either side edge of the panel 48. Together the panels 42 and 48 form a generally L shaped structure. Preferably, as shown in Figures 3 to 8 and 9, the roller assemblies or brackets 50 each include a stamped, sheet metal body 102 having side flanges 104, which are bent at right angles to body 102, and roller mounting ears or flanges 106 each having a roller mounting aperture 107 therethrough. An end flange 108 between ears 106 is bent at right angles to the plane of body 102 and flanges 104. A wheel assembly 110 having a plastic tyre 112 rotatably mounted on a metallic stud 114 Figures 5 and 7 with balls or other rolling members therebetween is pressed and swaged through one of the apertures 107 such that the tyre projects below and beyond ear 106 to support the panel assembly 40 as shown. The formed bracket 50 is fitted over one side edge of panel 48 and secured with screws or other fasteners 116 Figure 5 . Depending on which ear 106 the wheel assembly 110 is secured to, the bracket assembly 50 may be used on either the right or left side edge of the panel 48. Alternatively, it is possible to substitute tracks not shown mounted along the bottom panel 16 parallel to the side edges of the cover 14 and slides mounted at spaced positions on the end of panel 48 for sliding movement in those tracks to allow the panel assembly to slide forwardly as cover 14 is lifted. Of course, other bearing assemblies or roller assemblies sufficient to support the weight of the panel assembly 40, having the required spacing and dimensions, and allowing the panel assembly to move forwardly as the cover panel 14 is lifted may also be used. On the undersurface of the panel 48 in line with the vanity panel 42 are also secured a pair of wooden or rubber support blocks 52 Figures 4, 5 and 7 each of which has a height substantially the same as the height of the roller assemblies 50 when secured to the end panel 48. The support blocks 52 engage the bottom panel 16 when the vanity panel 42 is in its raised position as shown in Figure 4 such that the entire panel assembly 40 is generally supported in a vertical position with the rollers 50 engaging the inside surface of the front panel 20 as shown. Pivotally secured to the front surface of the panel 42 immediately adjacent its top edge is a mirror support panel 54 having a generally planar mirror 56 silvered on its front or rear surface and mounted on its outwardly facing surface by means of clear acrylic mirror brackets 58 or the like. The mirror 56 may be planar or curved for magnification. The top edge of the mirror support panel 54 is secured by means of a pair of spaced, loose pin hinges 60 to the upper front surface of the vanity panel 42. The hinges 60 allow the panel 54 to be pivoted from a position generally parallel to and abutting the vanity panel 42 to a position at which the panel 54 extends at an acute angle to the panel 42 with its lower edge the greatest distance from the panel 42 as shown in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6. As in the cabinet 12, the panels 42, 48 and 54 may be formed from wood, particle or chip board, moulded plastic or the like and finished or covered as desired with veneers, plastic laminate sheets, or the like. In order to allow the panel 54 to be selectively positioned at different angular positions with respect to the vanity panel 42 and held in those positions, an adjustable bracket assembly 62 is provided. The bracket assembly 62 includes a curved, slotted bracket 64 pivotally mounted at 63 to the front surface of the vanity panel 42 as shown in Figure 4. A thumbscrew or other threaded element 66 coupled with a leaf spring not shown to provide friction pressure is received over a threaded stud extending laterally from one side edge of the mirror support panel 54 through the central slot in the bracket 64. As the mirror support panel 54 is pivoted outwardly away from the vanity panel 42 on hinges 60, the stud slides along the slot in the bracket 64 while the slotted bracket pivots due to movement of the stud within the bracket. When the desired position is reached, the thumbscrew 66 may be tightened sufficiently to hold the mirror support panel 54 and mirror 56 in the desired angular position with respect to the vanity panel 42 yet allow adjustment against the leaf spring pressure without loosening the thumbscrew 66 unless that thumbscrew is overtightened. This selected position remains constant regardless of whether the cover 14 is raised or lowered as shown in Figures 2 to 6 except when the panel 54 is pivoted outwardly to its greatest extent. When in its maximum outward position, the panel 54 and mirror 56 would engage the bottom panel 16 when the cover 14 is closed and the panel 42 is pivoted rearwardly. Thus, for tall persons who need the mirror pivoted out to its maximum position, the panel 54 need only be pivoted in a slight distance before the cover 14 is closed which keeps the panel 54 and mirror 56 in generally the same angular position but allows closure as shown in Figure 5. Alternatively, the height or depth of the panels 18, 20 and 48 may be increased to provide additional space to receive the panel 54 and mirror 56 even when pivoted outwardly to their maximum extent. Of course, other adjustable mechanisms such as ratcheted brackets, spacing members or the like may be used to position the mirror support panel 54 with respect to the vanity panel 42 as desired. When raised, the cover 14 allows the vanity panel 42 to swing and pivot outwardly on the hinges 44 and rollers 50 along the top surface of the bottom panel 16 until the vanity panel 42 is generally vertically positioned and the mirror support panel 54 and mirror 56 are angularly positioned for viewing as shown in Figure 4. If the cabinet 10 is located in a room with sufficient ambient lighting, no illumination for use of or viewing with the mirror 56 is needed. However, in other environments where ambient lighting is insufficient or greater illumination is desired, appropriate lighting panel assemblies 70 may be included in the vanity cabinet. As shown in Figures 2 to 6, the panel assembly 40 may include a pair of elongated lighting panels 70, one positioned generally parallel to and adjacent either side edge of the mirror support panel 54 on the front surface of the vanity panel 42. Each lighting panel 70 includes a pair of incandescent light bulb receptacles or lampholders 72 preferably receiving 40 watt incandescent light bulbs or lamps 74. Bulb receptacles 72 are positioned adjacent the upper and lower ends of the light panels 70 such that one bulb 74 will be located on either side of the mirror adjacent the upper end of the mirror with a pair of bulbs adjacent the lower end as well. Each bulb 74 has a length sufficient to provide illumination adjacent the mirror even when the mirror is angled away from the vanity panel 42 as shown in Figures 2, 4 and 5. Thus, the bulbs 74 will extend past the surface of the mirror 56 adjacent the upper end of the mirror and will be substantially level with the surface of the mirror at the lower end of the mirror even when the mirror support 54 is moved substantially away from the vanity panel 42 with bracket assembly 62. Of course, other light assemblies could be used incorporating fluorescent or other light sources as desired. The light panels 70 are typically secured to the vanity panel 42 with screws 76 Figures 3 and 4 or the like. In order to operate the light panel 70, a conventional metal or other switch box 80 incorporating a normally closed momentary contact switch assembly not shown operated by a plunger member 82 Figures 4 and 7 is secured to the rear surface of the vanity panel 42. Pivoting of the vanity panel 42 away from the cover 14 when it is raised releases the plunger 82 to close the switch and turn on the lights. Conversely, when the cover is closed, the switch is opened to deactivate the lights. Alternatively, a manual switch not shown could be substituted on the front of the panel 42. The switch box 80 is typically aligned with the left hand light panel 70 but includes a rigid electrical conduit 84 extending across the rear surface of the vanity panel 42 to a position in registry with the right hand light panel 70 for housing electrical wiring leading to the right hand assembly. Appropriate apertures not shown through the vanity panel 42 are provided to lead wiring from the switch box 80 and conduit 84 to the light assemnblies 70. As shown in Figures 4, 5 and 7, an electrical cable 85 extends out of the bottom of the switch box 80 and through a retaining clip 86 fastened to the undersurface of the cover 14 adjacent its rear edge to support the cable above the bottom panel 16. From the support clip 86, the electrical cable 85 extends downwardly through the aperture 36 in the bottom panel 16 and out of the cabinet 12 for connection to a building or other electrical system providing conventional, alternating electric current. The cabinet has a continuous earth or ground and is designed to be plugged into an earth or ground fault protected receptacle through the cable 85. The cable 85 is sufficiently long between the clip 86 and the switch box 80 to allow the vanity panel 42 to pivot to its full upright position as shown in Figure 4. Conversely, when the cover 14 is closed and the vanity panel 42 returns to its folded position, the cable 85 automatically bends and folds within the space between the rear of the vanity panel 42 and the undersurface of the cover 14 as shown in Figure 5. Another embodiment 90 of the vanity cabinet is shown in Figure 8 wherein like numbers indicate like parts to those in embodiment 10. Embodiment 90 is substantially similar to vanity cabinet 10 except that it is shown prior to incorporation in any built in cabinet, includes at the top only the strip member 25 at the rear of the cover 14 and includes the extension 31 on cover 14 prior to cutting for alignment with the adjacent cabinetry. Also, a temporary support panel 94 is screwed to the front edge of the bottom panel 16 to support the top panel 14 parallel to the bottom panel 16 during shipment and installation of the vanity cabinet 90 between factory built cabinets, custom site built cabinets, side panels, desk units or the like. Embodiment 90 of the cabinet enables custom fitting of the invention within a countertop or cabinet. The installer need merely provide his own top panel side pieces 24 which will mate with and extend parallel to the cover panel adjacent either side and abut the strip member 25. Then a decorative, front panel is substituted in place of the panel 94 and the cover 14 is cut to match adjacent cabinets, followed by covering the side pieces 24 and the strip member 25 with appropriate sheeting or veneer if desired. Alternatively, the mirror panel assembly 40 may be separately provided such that the installer can build his own cabinet structure for receipt of the panel assembly. In such case, the panel assembly 40, complete with switch box 80 and wiring 85, is ready for receipt of a pair of loose pin hinges 44 and may be secured via such hinges to the underside of a cover panel or other pivotable cover provided by the installer. The electrical cable 85 need only be clipped to the undersurface of the cover and lead downwardly through an opening in the bottom panel in the cabinet and connected to the existing electrical system of the building in which the cabinet is mounted to ready the invention for operation. In any embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that operation begins with the vanity panel in its substantially horizontal, folded position as shown in Figure 5. In that folded position, the roller assemblies 50 extend downwardly past the end edge of the end flange 48 and engage the top surface of the bottom panel 16. Such position provides an interior space in which the light assemblies 70, bulbs 74, angularly positioned mirror support panel 54, and mirror 56 are easily received even when the cover 14 of the vanity cabinet 10 or 90 is closed. When movement to the operating position is desired, the front edge of the cover 14 is raixed to the position shown in Figures 2 to 4. The pivotal movement of the cover 14 upwardly raises the front edge of the vanity panel 42 by means of the loose pin hinges 44 while the force of gravity continuously urges the opposite, lower end of the vanity panel 42 toward the front of the cabinet. Such movement is allowed by rollers 50 until the rollers engage the inside surface of the front panel 20 and the support blocks 52 engage the top surface of the bottom panel 16. In that position, the vanity panel 42 is substantially vertical and supported against the inside surface of the front panel 20 in secure position to allow viewing of the mirror which itself is separately positioned by means of the bracket assembly 62 about hinges 60. The weight of the cover 14 pressing downwardly on the top edge of the vanity panel 42 retains the blocks 52 in contact with the bottom panel and roller assemblies 50 in engagement with the corner between the front panel 20 and the bottom panel 16. Simultaneously, when the vanity panel 42 pivots away from the cover 14, the plunger 82 on the switch housing 80 is released to automatically activate the light panels 70 and bulbs 74 to provide illumination for viewing in the mirror. Should the angular position of the mirror support panel 54 be incorrect for the operator, the thumbscrew 66 need merely be loosened and the angular position of the mirror support panel changed followed by retightening of the thumbscrew. If the thumbscrew is not overtightened, the mirror position can be changed against the friction pressure of the leaf spring in the adjustment bracket. When closing of the cover and folding of the vanity panel is desired, the mirror support panel 54 will remain in its present position while the vanity panel 42 is urged backwardly and the cover panel 14 is lowered until the undersurface of the strip member 30 engages the top edge of the front panel 20. Alternatively, the panel 54 can be pivoted back against the panel 42 before closing, if desired. It will also be understood that appropriate storage areas 95 are provided adjacent either edge of panel assembly 40 inside the cabinet 10 or 90 as shown in Figure 6. The storage areas 95 may be used to house toilet articles, spare light bulbs 74 or the like and are accessible when the cover 14 is raised by reaching under the top panel 24 on either side. To assist in closing the cover 14, or to prevent the cover from unexpectedly falling, each of the embodiments 10 and 90 of the cabinet may include a gas and spring loaded damping strut or cylinder 120 Figure 4 which slows the rate of closing of the cover 14. The cylinder 120 is designed for mounting between the rear panel 32 and the undersurface of the cover 14 adjacent one side edge of the cover and slows the closure over the entire path of travel of cover 14. The cylinder 120 thus serves to dampen and decelerate the closure of the cover 14. A suitable cylinder 120 may be obtained from Suspa of Altdorf, West Germany under model designation Type 16 .
