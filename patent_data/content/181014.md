# Process for the preparation of polyketones.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of polyketones by polymerization of a mixture of CO and an alkenically unsaturated hydrocarbon in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst containing ligands, wherein hydrocarbon groups occur which are bound to an element from Group V a, characterized in that the catalyst used is a complex com pound obtained by reaction of a palladium, cobalt or nickel compound, an anion of a carboxylic acid with a pKa lower than 2, and a bidentate liqand of the general formula R¹R² M R M R³R⁴, wherein M represents phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are similar or dissimilar hydrocarbon groups, R is divalent organic bridg ing group not causing steric hindrance.
