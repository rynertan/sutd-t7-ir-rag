## Description
MOUNTING A STRUCTURE SUCH AS AHYDRAULIC CYLINDER ON A SUPPORTThe present invention relates to the mounting of a structure such as a hydraulic cylinder housing on a support such as a support plate.The invention relates more specifically to apparatus such as hydraulic actuator apparatus capable of operating a mechanism at a remote location by way of, for example, a master cylinder connected to a slave cylinder installed at the remote location, a flexible conduit interconnecting the master cylinder and the slave cylinder. It is known to provide such hydraulic actuator apparatus for actuating, for instance, the release mecnanism of a friction clutch. In British patent Specification No.1,539,879, and in corresponding United States Letters Patents No. 4,407,125 and United States Letters Patent No. 4,454,632, for example, there are disclosed pre assembled friction clutch hydraulic control apparatus, which are prefilled with hydraulic fluid prior to shipment to a motor vehicle manufacturer for installation on a motor vehicle.For the purpose of installing such apparatus on a motor vehicle, both the master cylinder and the slave cylinder are provided with a mounting flange integrally cast or molded with the cylinder housing and disposed peripherally to the cylinder housing at some intermediary location between the ends of the housing.The mounting flange has mounting holes, or is provided with ears or lugs having mounting holes, for installation of the cylinder on a support plate or panel, or on a support bracket.The master cylinder is generally installed by being mounted in an opening in a bulkhead, such as the vehicle floorboard, with an end of the cylinder housing projecting on one side of the bulkhead and the other end of the housing projecting on the other side of the bulkhead. The bulkhead is provided with a plurality of mounting holes disposed around the periphery of the opening. The mounting holes in the flange of the cylinder housing, or in the mounting lugs, must be aligned with the mounting holes in the bulkhead or floorboard, and the cylinder housing securely attached in position by means of appropriate bolts, or other fasteners passed through the aligned mounting holes.Similarly, the slave cylinder is generally supported through an opening in the clutch housing itself, or on a lug or bracket attached to the clutch housing or integrally cast with the clutch housing. The slave cylinder housing is attached in position by way of bolts passed through aligned mounting holes in the clutch housing or bracket and in the cylinder housing mounting flange or lugs.Other mounting arrangement for master and slave cylinders have been developed in the past for simplyfying the installation of such hydraulic apparatus on the assembly line of a motor vehicle manufacturer, as disclosed for example in the aforesaidBritish patent specification, in the form of a snap ring retainer for the slave cylinder and of a push and rotate fastening arrangement for the master cylinder. The master cylinder is mounted through a square opening in the bulkhead. The housing of the master cylinder is provided with a substantially square flange spaced apart form a circular flange. The square flange is of a size permitting passage thereof through the square opening in the bulkhead.A resilient gasket is installed between the two flanges and is compressed when the square flange is pushed through the square opening in the bulkhead and the housing rotated approximately 450 around its longitudinal axis, thus causing the tips of the square flange to engage the rear surface of the bulkhead proximate the square opening and hold the cylinder housing in position, in view of the diagonal of the square flange having a length greater than the distance between opposite sides of the square opening. However, in such an arrangement, only frictional forces resulting from the compression of the resilient gasket, and causing engagement of the square flange tip surface with the corresponding surface of the bulkhead, prevent rotation of the master cylinder housing relative to the square opening, as no other positive lock is provided.An object of the present invention is to provide an improved mounting of a hydraulic cylinder in a mounting aperture in a support such as bulkhead or support plate which simplifies installation.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a hydraulic cylinder housing and support combination comprising a radial projection on one of the housing and support and an opening in the other of the housing and support which receives the radial projection whereby subsequent relative rotation between the housing and support positions the radial projection adjacent a retaining surface on the other of the housing and support to inhibit axial separation of the housing and support,the other of the housing and support member defining an abutment which limits said relative rotation so as to align the projection with a retaining surface defined by a recess in said other of the housing and support member, means being provided for urging said projection into the recess or retaining the projection in the recess.The said means may be placed in position after location of the projection in the recess.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a mounting structure for coupling a member or housing hereinafter called a housing a support comprising a radial projection on one of said housing and support, an opening in the other of said housing and support defining a slot which permits free passage of said projection into said opening, a recess defined in said other of the housing and support adjacent the opening and which defines an abutment, said projection being rotatable within said opening through a distance limited by said abutment after passage of the projection through said slot so as to align the projection with the recess for location therein and means for urging said lug into the recess which is locatable subsequent to locating the projection in the recess.Preferably the means for urging the projection into the recess is a resilient clip. The clip may be U shaped having a pair of bowed legs which have a configuration which causes a resilient bias to be applied between a portion of the housing and said support for urging the projection into the recess. The legs may pass one each side of a flat surface on aid one of the housing and support. The extremities of the legs may have protrusions thereon which inhibit accidental removal of the clip. Preferably the opening includes a portion extending between faces of the other of said housing and support ,a cut out section extending from one said face to said other face and said recess extending from said other face for a predetermined depth into said portion of the opening, said recess being arranged to receive said projection between said abutment and a further abutment. Preferably the first said abutment extends to said other face and the further abutment extends part of the way to said other face, whereby relative rotation between said housing and support in one direction after introduction of said projection through said opening is prevented by said first abutment extending all the way to said other face and relative rotation in an opposite direction is enabled by passage of said projection over said further abutment extending part of the way to said other face.The opening may be cylindrical. Preferably the portion of the opening is cylindrical and the cut out section is also cylindrical and conforms to the perimeter of said projection.At least a pair of projections may be provided and at least a pair of spaced apart recesses may be defined adjacent said opening for co operation with said projections. The projections and recesses may be symmetrically disposed, e.g. in a circunferential sense.Preferably, the housing includes a face and the means for urging the projection into the recess is insertable between said face and said support. The said face may be defined by a circular flange.The housing may be a housing of hydraulic slave cylinder of a motor vehicle hydraulic apparatus, e.g. a clutch release apparatus.Preferably an operating member, e.g. an output rod, of said cylinder projects beyond a side of the support opposite to the side from which the projection is inserted into the opening.Mounting in accordance with the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 represents, in conjunction with a hydraulic apparatus in the form of a friction clutch hydraulic release mechanism, an example of a slave cylinder mounted on a support in accordance with the present invention.Fig. 2 is a partial view, showing the slave cylinder introduced through a mounting opening in a support plate Fig. 3 and 4 are respectively elevation and side view of an example of a retaining clip of the invention Fig. 5 is an exploded perspective view of a hydraulic cylinder and corresponding mounting plate with a mounting opening according to the present invention.Fig. 6 is a front elevation view of the mounting plate Fig. 7 is a front elevation view of the mounting plate showing the cylinder being introduced through the opening in the mounting plate andFig. 8 is a view of the mounting plate with the cylinder installed through the opening in the mounting plate, as seen fromline 8 8 of Fig. 2.Referring to the drawings and more particularly to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a hydraulic apparatus 10 in the exemplary form of a master cylinder 11 mounted through the bulkhead 12 of a motor vehicle. The master cylinder 11 has an input piston rod 14 mechanically and pivotally conected to a clutch release pedal arm 16 for actuation by the motor vehicle drive. The master cylinder 11 is connected to a slave cylinder 18 by an appropriate conduit, preferably in the form of a flexible hose 20. The slave cylinder 18 is mounted in an appropriate position proximate to, on, or through the motor vehicle clutch housing 21 in such manner that its output rod 22 operates the clutch release mechanism, such as a clutch release lever 24.In the example of structure illustrated, the output rod 22 of the slave cylinder 18, is restrained during shipment of the hydraulic apparatus 10 to a motor vehicle manufacturer, and during installation of the apparatus of the motor vehicle assemble line, by a break away retaining strap 26 of the type, for example, disclosed in LettersPatent No. 4,454,632, assigned to the Applicant in the present application.Prior to shipment to the motor vehicle manufacture, the clutch release hydraulic apparatus 10 is assembled as a complete unit, including the flexible hose 20 interconnecting the master cylinder 11 and the slave cylinder 18 and the slave cylinder output rod retaining strap 26. The apparatus 10 is installed on the motor vehicle on the assembly line as a ready to function unit. Prior to shipment, the hydraulic apparatus 10 is prefilled with hydraulic fluid, including filling a reservoir of hydraulic fluid which, in some structures, is a separate remotely located reservoir connected to the master cylinder 11 by a flexible hose but which, in the example of structure illustrated, is a hydraulic fluid reservoir 28 formed integrally with the housing of the master cylinder 11.Both the housing of the slave cylinder 18 and the housing of the master cylinder 11 may be cast of metal or, preferably, they are molded of plastic.The master cylinder 11 is installed through the motor vehicle bulkhead or floorboard 12, with its end portion from which project the input rod 14 disposed within the driver s compartment.The structure for attaching the master cylinder 11 through the motor vehicle bulkhead or floorboard 12 may consist of a conventional mounting flange provided on the housing of the master cylinder 11, aligned mounting holes in the mounting flange and the bulkhead or floorboard, and a nut and bolt fastening arrangement, the bolts being passed through the aligned holes. The slave cylinder 18 is mounted, in the example of structure illustrated, through an opening 30 in the clutch bell housing 21, a portion of the clutch bell housing 21 defining a mounting plate 32 provided with mounting aperture 30.The housing 33 of the slave cylinder 18 is provided proximate its end protected by an elastomeric boot 34 through which project the output rod 22, with an integral circular flange 36 having a flat annular face 38 of a diameter larger than the widest dimension of the opening 30 in the mounting plate 32. A plurality of ears or lugs 40 are outwardly and radially disposed, cast integral with the housing of the slave cylinder 18. There are three lugs 40, in the example of structure illustrated, each having a circular tip 42 and a flat partially located a predetermined distance D from the flange annular surface 38. The housing 33 of the slave cylinder 18 has a generally cylindrical portion 46, and a part of diametrically opposed planar recessed portions 48, Figs. 2 and 5.The mounting plate aperture 30, as best shown at Figs. 5 6 has three cylindrical segments or slots 50 of a radius and width accomodating the cylinder housing lugs 40 and three projecting cylindrical stepped segments 52 accepting the cylindrical body portion 46 of the slave cylinder housing 33. The mounting opening 30 further comprises three notches or recesses 54 extending over an arc of a circle and having a width accomodating the width of the cylinder housing lugs 40. Each notch or recess 54 has a partially annular bottom surface 46 substantially parallel to the mutually parallel front and rear surfaces 57 and 59 of the mounting plate 32, i.e. in a plane substantially perpendicular to the axis of the opening 30.An abutment sidewall 58 extends from each surface 56 to the front surface 57 of the mounting plate 32 and an abutment sidewall 60 extends from each surface 56 to part of the way toward the front surface 57 of the mounting plate 32. The junctions between the cylindrical slots 50 and the cylindrical stepped segment 52 form respectively an abutment wall 62 that extends all the way from one surface 57 of the mounting plate 32 to other surface 59, and an abutment wall 64 that extends from the rear surface 59 of the mounting plate 32 to a ledge 66 at the end of the abutment wall 64 proximate the front surface 57 of the mounting plate 32, the length of the abutment wall 64 being substantially equal to, or slightly less than, the distance D between the lugs rear surface 44 and the flange annular face 38. The housing 33 of the slave cylinder 18 is mounted through the opening 30 simply by being pushed through the opening with the lugs 40 passing through the cylindrical segment or slots 50 of the opening, Fig. 7, until the annular surface 38 of the flange 36 engages the rear surface of the mounting plate 32, followed by clockwise rotation of the cylinder 18, Figs. 7 and 8 until the side of each lug 40 abuts against the abutment sidewall 58 of the notches or recesses 54.Because the length of the abutment wall 64, i.e. the distance separating the ledges 66 of the abutment wall 64 from the rear surface 59 of the mounting plate 32 is equal to or less than the distance D separating the partially annular rear face 44 of the lugs 40 from the annular face 38 of the housing flange 36, clockwise rotation of the cylinder 18, with the annular face 38 of the flange 36 applied against the rear surface 39 of the mounting plate 32, is allowed in view of the face 44 of the lugs 40 clearing the ledges 66 of the abutment walls 64. Rotation of the cylinder 18 in an opposite direction is prevented by the other side of the lugs 40 engaging the abutment walls 62.Once the cylinder 18 has been rotated to the position illustrated at Fig. 8, with one side of the cylinder housing lugs 40 abutting against the sidewall 58 of the notches or recesses 54, a retainer spring clip 68, Figs. 2 5, is manually pushed between the rear surface 59 of the mounting plate 32 and the annular face 38 of the cylinder housing flange 36. As best shown at Fig. 3, the spring clip 68, which is made of spring steel or resilient plastic, is substantially U shaped and is provided with a pair of integral substantially parallel bowed legs 70. The distance separating the inner edges 72 of the clip legs 70 is less than the diameter of the cylinder housing cylindrical portion 46 fitting within the mounting opening 30, such that each inner edge 72 of the legs 70 engages a recessed flat surface 48.The bowed legs 70 are provided at their free end with an inwardly projecting portion 74, the projecting portions 74 being separated by a distance which is slightly less than the distance separating the two opposite recessed flat surfaces 48, with the result that when the clip 68 is engaged, as illustrated at Fig. 2, the legs 70 are caused to spread apart, elastically, slightly while they pass over the recessed flat surfaces 48, and elastically return to their original position, such as to hold the clip 68 in position, with the inwardly projecting portions 74 interfering against accidental removal of the clip 68.The bow of the legs 70 causes the lugs 42 to be rear face 44 in engagement with the bottom surface 56 of the notches or recesses 54 in the mounting opening 30, thus locking the cylinder housing 33 securely fastened through the mounting opening 30 in the support plate 32, as the only force applied upon the housing 33 of the cylinder 18 during operation of the slave cylinder 18 is the reaction force resulting from extension of the output member 22 for operating a clutch release mechanism such as the lever arm 24, Fig. 1. The reaction force is directed longitudinally in the direction that tends to engage the cylinder housing mounting lugs 40 more firmly against the bottom surface 56 of the notches or recesses 54.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the clip 68, which is easily insertably manually between the annular face 38 of the cylinder flange 36 and the rear surface 59 of the mounting or support plate 32, and which provides a spring bias holding the lugs 40 constantly in engagement with the bottom surface 56 of the mounting recesses or notches 54, thus resulting in a substantially rattle proof mounting of the cylinder 18, may be replaced by an appropriate spacer, incompressible or preferably compressible. A resilient gasket may also be used, permanently installed on the annular face 38 of the flange 36, which in turn requires that sufficient force be exerted longitudinally on the cylinder housing 33 to compress the gasket to allow the lugs 40 to pass over the projecting ledges 66, on the lower side of the recesses or notches 54.Compression of such a resilient gasket is aided by cutting the end of the abutment walls 64, proximate the ledges 66, at an angle, such as to form a ramp engageable with the side of the lugs 40 to aid in compressing the resilient gasket during rotation of the cylinder housing 33. Also, it will be appreciated that the spring clip 68 may be installed prior to installing the cylinder through the opening in the mounting plate, which in turn requires that the bowed legs .70 of the clip be elastically flattened by moving the cylinder housing 33 longitudinally while rotating it to lock it in position in the mounting opening 30. Having thus described the present invention by way of an example of structure, given for illustrative purpose only, which is well designed for accomplishing the objects of the invention, modifications whereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art, what is claimed as new is a follows The term hydraulic cylinder used herein includes hydraulic actuators other than slave cylinders.
