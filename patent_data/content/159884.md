# Heat shock promoter and gene.

## Abstract
A bacterial strain, for example Escherichia coli, contains and replicates a recombinant DNA plasmid comprising a vec tor, a fragment of plant DNA controlling expression of a heat shock gene from an Agrobacterium strain inserted into a T DNA fragment of a Ti plasmid and a foreign gene or a soybean gene under control of said fragment of plant DNA. A suitable vector is pBR322, and examples of suitable foreign genes in clude a Z gene coating for Î² galactosidase or a crystalline endotoxin gene. Also disclosed are methods for recognising plant cells transformed by T DNA of Agrobacterium species by express ing a transformation recognition gene under control of a soy bean heat shock gene promoter.
