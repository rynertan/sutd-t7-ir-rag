# Production of vesiculated polymer beads.

## Abstract
An improved process for the manufacture of vesiculated beads has been developed which can be used for the production of semi gloss or satin finished paints. The process involves mixing an oil phase containing cross linkable polyester resin in solution with a monomer co polymerisable with the resin and an aqueous phase containing an emulsifying agent under conditions such that globules of the oil phase are formed having a diameter of less than 1.5 microns. The emulsion containing the globules also contains a base and the amount of the emulsifying agent is from 3 to 16 grams per 100 ml of the oil phase and the volume fraction has a value of 0.2 to 0.4 and X as defined is from 4 to 8. Preferably the beads are pigmented with titanium dioxide pigment.
