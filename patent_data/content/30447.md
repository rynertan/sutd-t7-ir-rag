# High pressure process for recovery of sulphur from gases.

## Abstract
A process is provided for producing elemental sulphur from a hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide containing gas stream by a Claus type of catalytic reaction. The process is based on the discovery that the conventional Claus catalyst, in the presence of liquid sulphur and at pressures considerably greater than one atmosphere, is significantly active toward the Claus catalytic reaction. Thus, in accordance with the inven tion, increasing the pressure of the reaction in the presence of liquid sulphur increases both the catalytic activity and the ele mental sulphur conversion. The process involves introducing a compressed hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide contain ing gas stream into a catalytic reactor and reacting the gases in a Claus catalyst bed in the reactor to produce elemental sul phur under conditions of temperature and pressure such that water in the reactor exists only as water vapour and sulphur va pour is condensed in the catalyst bed, being removed there from as a liquid. The pressure within the reactor is preferably between 5 and 50 atmospheres absolute.
