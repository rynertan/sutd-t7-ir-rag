# Production of hydrofined hydrocarbon resins.

## Abstract
An improved method for making hydrogenated petroleum resins by subjecting the resin to hydrogenation in the presence of a sulfided nickel 2 to 10 wt. tungsten 10 to 25 wt catalyst supported on a gamma alumina having fresh catalyst surface area ranging from 120 to 300 mÂ² g under a hydrogen pressure of 150 to 200 atmospheres and at a temperature in the range 250 C to 330 C and the resins so produced.
