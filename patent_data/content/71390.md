# A multiple image slide projector.

## Abstract
The slide projector 10 includes side by side image projection systems 21 and 23 and a circular slide tray 15 , with slides passing in operation directly between the slide tray 15 and either of two slide gates 33 and 34 , the slide gates 33 and 34 moving between a first position in which slides are acquired and released, and a second position in which slides are projected onto a screen. A slide lifter 37 , a slide tray lock, slide clamps on each slide gate 33, 34 , and the slide gates 33 and 34 are operated in a particular sequence relative to the movement of the slide tray 15 to ensure proper handling of the slides in the projector 10 . The slide tray 15 fits on a central hub 39 which in turn is independently driven. Sensors are provided to continuously detect the position of the lifter 37 , the slide gates 33 and 34 and the slide tray 15 . A front end assembly 17 which incorporates lenses 11 and 13 which move laterally and vertically, with the longitudinal axes of the lenses 11 and 13 remaining parallel at all times, provides precise image alignment, including image overlap and separation.
