# IMMUNOASSAYS UTILIZING COVALENT CONJUGATES OF POLYMERIZED ENZYME AND ANTIBODY

## Abstract
An enzyme is cross linked to form a polymerized enzyme which is covalently coupled to an antibody or antibody frag ment. The use of the antibody polymeric enzyme conjugate in immunoassays provides enhanced signal generation and, therefore, short assay time and high sensitivity.
