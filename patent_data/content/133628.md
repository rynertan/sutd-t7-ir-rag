# Liquid developer for development of electrostatic images.

## Abstract
A liquid electrophoretic developer composition suitable for rendering visible electrostatically charged areas, which composition contains in an electrically insulating non polar carrier liquid having a volume resistivity of at least 10‚Åπ ohm.cm and a dielectric constant less than 3, dispersed colouring matter acting as toner particles and at least one polymer comprising cationic groups neutralized with counter anions, the said cationic groups being positively charged groups of metal ion containing coordination compounds.
