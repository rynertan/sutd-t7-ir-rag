# Pulling over and toe lasting machine.

## Abstract
In a pulling over and lasting machine in addition to a toe pincer 18 there are provided two sets of side pincers 20 , each set being mounted on a support 26 pivotal about an axis 24 extending heightwise of the shoe bottom and passing through or adjacent the toe pincer 18 . Each pincer 20 is adjustably mounted on its support 26 but in addition each set is movable bodily, through its support, about its axis 24 . In one embodiment the supports 26 are movable only in op posite directions, i.e. towards and away from one another, thus to accommodate to shoes of different widths. In a second embodiment, on the other hand, in addition these supports 26 are also movable in the same direction, thus to cause the pincers 20 to be accommodated to left and right shoes. For clamping the shoe at its heel end, a heel rest 12 is provided the transverse position of which is dictated solely by the heel end of the shoe without applying to the shoe any significant forces tending to re orient it, this being achieved by allowing free movement with low friction transversely of the longitudinal centreline L .
