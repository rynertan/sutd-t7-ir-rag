# Mass wave soldering system II.

## Abstract
Contact of a soldered board by a soldering oil supplied from within a solder wave takes place immediately following deposition of molten solder onto the board. The oil causes relocation of solder on and or removal of excess solder from the underside of the board, and any interconnections, component leads and or component bodies carried thereon before the solder solidifies as shorts, icicles or bridges.
