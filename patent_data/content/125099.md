# Securing device.

## Abstract
A cable securing device comprises a strap 2 which can pass around elongate members 1 to be secured and tension ing means for tensioning the strap. The tensioning means comprises a plate having upstanding walls 5, 6 at each end between which the strap can pass and a rod 9 having a longitudinally extending slit and an eye 11 , the rod being rotatably securable in aligned apertures in a pair of upstand ing walls of the plate with the eye on the outside of one of the walls and a key for rotating the rod to and locking it in a required tensioning position has a base 13 and two arms 14, 15 extending from the base in substantially the same direc tion the base extends through the eye of the rod and the base and or the arms are resilient to allow relative movement of the ends of the arms. At least one wall upstanding from the plate has slots 18, 19 located and so dimensioned that once the strap is tensioned to the required degree the key can be trned in the eye to bring the arms of the key into releasable snap engagement in the slots.

## Description
SECURING DEVICE This invention relates to a device for securing at least one cable, pipe or other elongate member to a support and or for securing together two or more cables, pipes or other elongate members, for convenience, hereinafter being referred to by the expression cable securing device . Cable securing devices are known in which a strap is wrapped around elongate members to secure them together, one end of the strap being fixed to a tensioning device comprising a rotatable split rod, and the free end of the strap being held in the slit in the rod. When the rod is rotated the strap is tensioned around the elongate member and possibly support members to secure them together. It is of course important that the split rod is thereafter prevented from unintenional rotation leading to loss of strap tension or to excessive tension and various locking arrangements have been proposed.The cable securing device of British Application No 2081802A is among the few that have been commercially exploited on a significant scale as far as the Applicants are aware, the devices of for example US Patent No 1490618,British Patents Nos 1225298 and 1500628 and BritishApplication No 2085066A have not been found to satisfy market needs. The present invention provides a cable securing device that, in contrast to those previously available, meets all of the following requirements i it is easily assembled ii it can be locked in a multiplicity of positions every half turn of the split rod iii it can be tensioned and locked quickly and easily by hand, without any tools iv failure to lock is immediately apparent v once locked resists unlocking on accidental impact vi once locked can be released for modification or adjustment, but only by the use of a suitable tool so reducing risk of interference by unauthorised persons According to the present invention, a cable securing device comprises a strap which can pass around elongate members to be secured and tensioning means for tensioning the strap, the tensioning means comprising a plate having upstanding walls at each end between which the strap can pass a rod having a longitudinally extending slit and an eye, the rod being rotatably securable in aligned apertures in a pair of upstanding walls of the plate with the eye on the outside of one of the walls and operating means for rotating the rod to and locking it in a required tensioning position, characterised in that the said operating means comprises a key having a base and two arms extending from the base in substantially the same direction, the base extending through the eye of the rod and the base and or the arms being resilient to allow relative movement of the ends of the arms, and at least one wall upstanding from the plate having slots located and so dimensioned that once the strap is tensioned to the required degree the key can be turned in the eye to bring the arms of the key into releasable snap engagement in the slots. Preferably the base and arms of the key are constituted by a U shape bend from a length of rod.Preferably also the free end of at least one of the arms is extended and the extension so bent as to make the key captive in the eye, so avoiding the need for any separate means to prevent loss of the key. In a first preferred arrangement, the base, the arms and the extension or extensions form a substantially closed loop of rectangular or other shape, in a second preferred arrangement each of the arms is extended in an individual loop. Preferably the slots for engaging the arms of the key are formed in the wall of the said pair that is remote from the eye, but they could be formed alternatively in the wall adjacent the eye or in an additional upstanding wall provided for the purpose or aligned slots might be found in more than one wall. W s cable securing device can either be used on its own for securing together two or more cables, or in conjunction with a base member and bar arrangement as described and claimed in our British Patent No 2082242B for securing one or more cables to a support, or can be used in conjunction with a bar defined by, for example, a rung of a cable ladder, or the central portion of a U bolt, for securing a cable or cables to the bar The invention is further illustrated, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a first form of cable securing device in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is an exploded view of the tensioning means used in the cable securing device of Figure 1 Figures 3 to 6 are views, similar to Figure 2, showing four modified forms of tensioning means. The cable securing device shown in Figures 1 and 2 is shown securing a bundle of insulated cables and or pipes I together. It comprises a stainless steel strap 2 one end of which a tensioning device 3 is mounted by welding, by folding the strap around the plate or in any other suitable way. The tensioning device comprises a stainless steel plate 4 Figure 2 having two upstanding walls 5, 6 spaced to accommodate the strap 2 Figure 1 between them. The walls have respective apertures 7 8 which are aligned to receive a stainless steel split pin 9. A gripper washer 10 can be used, if desired to hold the split pin in place. Inserted through the eye 11 of the split pin 9 is a key 12 which is bent from stainless steel rod. This comprises a base 13 extending through the eye, two arms 14, 15 which extend parallel to each other in the same direction away from the base and have extensions 16, 17 which are bent inwards to form a substantially closed loop and so make the key captive in the eye 11. The cable securing device is installed by passing the free end of the strap 2 around the cables etc. 1, preferably twice in which case a middle portion of the strap passes between the plate 4 and the split pin 9 and then tucked into the slit of the split pin. Excess length of strap can be trimmed off if necessary. The strap is now tensioned by turning the key 12 to rotate the split pin 9 in either direction. When the required tension is achieved, rotation is stopped with the base 13 of the key roughly parallel to the plate 4 and the key is then rotated about its base through about half a turn until the arms 14, 15 snap into slots 18, 19 tor vice versa, depending on which way up the pin is provided in the wall 6 to receive them. Once locked in this way, the key is unlikely to be released accidentally, even by impacts causing minor damage to the corners of the wall 6 and the stiffness of the key 12 is such that it cannot be released by finger pressure so resisting casual vandalism but it can be released by levering with a large screwdriver or other suitable tool The modified device shown in Figure 3 differs only in that the extensions 16, 17 further include loops 20, 21 which can be urged together with pliers as an alternative means of release they may also be engaged by a rod to assist tightening, though this is not normally necessary. The modified device of Figure 4 is similar to that of Figures 1 and 2 except that the extensions 22, 23 are simple loops having the primary function of making the key 12 captive in the eye 11. The device of Figure 5 has the slots 24, 25 opening inwardly rather than outwardly so that the arms 14, 15 need to be urged towards one another to release the key, and loops 26, 27 are provided to assist this as well as making the key captive. The device of figure 6 differs from that of figure 5 only in having slots 24, 25, 28, 29 in both of the walls 5, 6.
