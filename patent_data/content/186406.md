# PAPERMAKERS FABRIC HAVING A TIGHT BOTTOM WEFT GEOMETRY

## Abstract
A two face, double layer forming fabric having a tight bottom weft geometry. The fabric, in general, comprises first and second pluralities of cross machine direction yarns and a plurality of machine direction yarns interwoven in accord ance with a desired weave pattern to define a top layer and a bottom layer. The top layer, which receives paper stock, is defined by the first plurality of cross machine direction yarns. The bottom layer, which contacts machine rolls, is defined by the second plurality of cross machine direction yarns. The second plurality of yarns are heat shrinkable. In one embodiment of the fabric, all machine direction yarns are woven in an 8 shaft weave to provide a 1 3 twill on the top layer and a 1 7 twill on the bottom layer. The cross machine direction floats formed by this weave pattern are flattened during heat treatment of the fabric because of shrinkage of the bottom layer cross machine direction yarns.
