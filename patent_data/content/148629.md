# AN APPARATUS FOR THE LIQUID TREATMENT OF SOLIDS

## Abstract
An apparatus for treating solids with a liquid at elevated or ambient temperatures comprises an assembly of vertical Pot 1 sealed by Lid 3 in which Pot 1 contains the liquid and hori zontal low level stirring means 6 inducing a liquid vortex and contains disposed above stirring means 6 a horizontal peri pheral appertured layer 9 offering minimum inferference with the vortex and contains vertical open cylinder 11 bottomed by central appertured layer 10 , co planar with layer 9 , being liquid permeable but supporting solids impermeably. The vor tex rises through layer 9 up internal vertical wall of Pot 1 and into diagonally opposite inlets 18 of horizontal tube 16 suspended internally from lid 3 above cylinder 11 . Liquid downpours through exit 19 of tube 16 through solids in cy linder 11 and through layer 10 to re enter the vortex. Layers 9 and 10 , are predisposed above the unstirred level of the thermostatted liquid, hence at the cease of stirring, the total iquid fall back leaves the solids isolated from the liquid at the thermostatted temperature of the assembly.
