# Turntable assemblies.

## Abstract
A turntable suitable for a VDU comprises a base 10,28 and a housing 16,18 rotatable relative to the base, the housing being adapted to support a VDU and having a central boss member 26 , the central boss member being adapted to project through a hole 32 formed in the base 10,28 and a low friction washer 30 member located between the base and the housing to support the weight thereof.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A turntable assembly comprising a base member and a plate member rotatable relative to the base member, the plate member being adapted to support a load and having a central boss member, the central boss member being adapted to project through a hole formed in the base member and a low friction washer member located between the base member and the plate member to support the weight thereof. 2. A turntable assembly as claimed in claim 1 in which the low friction washer member is resilient and urges the plate member and the base member apart. 3. A turntable assembly as claimed in claim 2 in which the plate member is retained on the base member by an annular portion of the base member which overlaps the outer portion of the plate member. 4. A turntable assembly as claimed in claim 3 in which bearing means are located between the outer portion of the plate member and the overlapping portion of the base member. 5. A turntable assembly as claimed in claim 4 in which the bearing means comprises two substantially semicircular bearing plates.

## Description
TURNTABLE ASSEMBLIES This invention relates to turntable assemblies and more particularly but not exclusively to a turntable assembly for a visual display unit VDU so that the VDU can be swivelled on a fixed base. It is an object of the invention therefore to provide a turntable assembly which will support a reasonable weight and have relatively low friction when it is rotated. According to a feature of the present invention a turntable comprises a base, a housing rotatable relative to the base, the housing being adapted to support a load and having a central boss member, the central boss member being adapted to project through a hole formed in the base and a low friction washer member located between the base and the housing to support the weight thereof. Preferably the low friction washer member comprises a waveform washer. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only from which further features of the invention will become apparent, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a turntable constructed in accordance with the invention and Figure 2 is a plan view of the turntable. In Figure 1 is shown a base 10 which has a circular hole 12 formed therein for the reception of an annular flange 14 formed on a housing 16. Secured to the lower part of the flange 14 by screws 20 is a circular rotatable plate 18. The diameter of the plate 18 is greater than the diameter of the hole 12 and between the plate 18 and the overlapping annular portion of the base 10 are located two substantially semicircular bearing plates 22 and 24. The bearing plates are secured in a circular groove formed in the lower portion of the base 10. In the centre of the plate 18 is secured a boss 26 and this projects through a hole formed through a clamp plate 28 to centralise the housing. The clamp plate is bolted underneath the base 10, and between the clamp plate 28 and the plate 18 is arranged a low friction waveform washer 30. The plate 18 is supported by the waveform washer 30 which also applies tension to urge the plate 18 upwards when viewed in Figure 1 so that the plate 18 contacts the bearing plates 22 and 24. A boss 32 is brazed in the hole through the clamp plate 28 and serves as a bearing for the boss 26.An arcuate slot 34 is formed in the clamp plate 28, and this is engaged by a pin 36 to restrict the angular movement of the housing 16. In this example 120 degrees of movement is permitted. The housing is intended to support a visual display unit, and a power supply cable 38 for the unit is fed through a hole 40 through the boss 26.
