## Description
Hand Cleansing Compositions This invention relates to hand cleansing compositions which are particularly suitable for cleansing heavily oiled hands, eg, those of engineers, and relates also to a method oi cleansing the hands using such compositions. Known hand cleansing compositions usually contain amine and or potash soaps, and these are sometimes mixed with other anionic or non ionic detergant substances. In addition, the lost effective contain aliphatic hydrocarbons, and lay contain emollients, for example glycerine and lanolin derivatives, to reduce any harmful effects which the solvents might have. The mechanism by ihich such coipositions operate to effect hand cleansing is as follows a on rubbing the composition into the hands, the oil dirt is dissolved in the hydrocarbon portion, b on applying water to the hands thereafter, the dissolved mixture is wholly or partially emulsified by the soap in the composition, and c this emulsion is then washed away. However, the ulsion formed by step b is only stable under moderately accurately controlled conditions eg, within a given range of dilutions , and it is found that, in practice, when such accurately controlled conditions do not disin, the emulsion breaks during the cleansing operation with resultant re deposition on the hmd of the hydrocarbon, and often some of the oil dirt, during the performance of step c .This is especially so when the lighter hydrocarbons usually empolyed in conventional hand cleansing compositions are present. This deposition can only be removed by a further subsequent wash with, for example, conventional toilet soap as a second operation. I have found a hand cleansing cotposition which removes dirt froa the hands by a mechanism different from that described above, which mechanism no longer requires the presence of a hydrocarbon to dissolve the dirt and which coiposition need not, therefore, contain any hydrocarbon. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a hand cleansing coiposition suitable particularly for cleansing hands soiled with oil and or grease, for example, engineers hands, which composition contains, as active ingredient, the condensate of at least one alcohol, phenol, or acid with allylene oxide there being 9 moles or alkylene oxide moiety per mole of the or each alcohol,phenol, or acid moiety, and a topically acceptable diluent or additive. The alkylene oxide is preferably ethlene oxide or propylene oxide. The mechanism Of operation of such a composition is different from that of the conventional compositions mentioned above. It is believed that the composition of the invention is effective because the 9 alkoxylated compound is deposited plated out on the skin in preference to the dirt or oil to be removed. According to another aspect oi the present invention there is provided a method of cleansing hands which consists of applying thereto a handcleansing coiposition containing, as active ingredient, the condensate of at least one alcohol,phenol, or acid with alkylene oxide, there, being 9 moles of alkylene oxide moiety per acle of alcohol or aid ioiety, and a topically acceptable diluent or additive. The method extends to cleansing other parts of the human body or even animals. A preferred coiposition contains a said condesate which has an arithmetical hydrophile lipophile balance HLB , ie, proportion of weigth percentage of hydrophilic lipophilic moieties, within a range of from 12.2 12.5, a condensate having an HLB value within this range being particularly suitable for cleansing the heavy oils and greases to be found on the hands of industrial engineers. The composition may although much less preferably contain one or nor. other detergents or soaps but only if these are not soluble in water if the conposition co tains an appreciable amount of a detergent or soap which is other than the 9 mole alkoxylate and which is soluble to any appreciable extent in water then the composition will not have the desired hand cleansing properties. When the composition contains a iixture of surface active agents, the components should be present in suitable proportions such that the said mixture has the desired HLB. The or each alcohol or acid moi ty of the condensate preferably has a long and more preferably linear hydrocarbon chain ie, a chain having icre than 8 carbon atoms therein, end it is found that, provided that such an alcohol or acid is condensed with 9 moles of alkylene oxide, then a compound having hand cleansing properties is obtained, this being irrespective of the number of carbon atoms in the chain. The condensate may be biologically hard eg an alkozylated nonyl phenol hydrophobe or soft eg an alkoxylated synthetic linear alcohol . 9 Mole ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty alcohols are especially preferred as the active ingredients in compositions of the present invention. The condensate may contain a mixture of different alcohol,phenol er acid moieties and many of the commercially available phenols or fatty alcohols or acids which are in fact mixtures can be used to provide the phenol, alcohol or acid part. Thus, condensates having particularly useful hand cleansing properties are Synperonic A9, a product of ICI consisting of 9 mole ethoxylated mixture of C13 15 ie, Ziegler alcohols a commercially available 9 mole ethoxylate of a C12 alcohol which is a product of Tensia end CD 919, a commercial 9 mole ethoxylated alcohol of Lankro Chemicals. A particularly preferred heavy duty coiposition contains a mixture of the 9 mole alkoxylate with a water soluble 2 mole alkoxylate, for example, Synperonic A2, the 2 mole ethoxylated equivalent of Sygeronic A9. Such compositions are particularly useful for removing printer s ink from the hands. It is thought that this ability to remove printer s ink is possibly as a result of the Speronic A2 throwing the other components of the composition out of solution. Although the 9 mole alkoxylated alcohd, phenol, or acid compounds can be used effectively as hand cleansers without being diluted or admixed with other ingredients in a composition, such a compound could be harmful to the skin in such concentrated for. Accordingly in practice, an emollient, for example, glycerine or an ethoxylated lanolin eg, a commercial product manufactured by Croda Limited is added. If glycerine is used, then there should be more than 0.4 present for it to have sufficient effect and less than 2 to avoid the deposition of a sticky deposit of glycerine on the hands in use. For example, an aqueous solution containing from 5 25 W V of Synper onic A9 and from 0.5 1 of glycerine or alternatively from 0.5 2 of an ethoxylated lanolin gives a non eaeharotie composition with particularly excellent hand cleansing effects. Alternatively or additionally, depending upon the required thickness of the cowposition, one of many commercially available thickening agents or gels can be added, for example, so ci coco amide the amide derived from coconut oil , a hydroxyethyl cellulose or sodium carboxy methyl cellulose. As more thickener is included in the mixture, the amount of lanolin and or glycerine may be progressively reduced. The composition may be formiated at will on the basis of cost, convenience and compatibility. Other ingredients which may be included in the composition are, for etiple, foaming agents eg, laurel ether sulphates scents, colours, and preservatives against bacterial degradation. Indeed the presence of a preservative in the composition is essential unless it contains an alternative ingredient which renders the hand cleansing composition positively antiseptic or germicidal. The constituents of the composition must, of course, be compatible with one another.One would not use, for example, a thickening agent which rendered the preservative ineffective. Thus, compositions embodying the invention may contain several ingredients. However a preferred composition contains at least 5 W V of the 9 mole alkoxylate. Compositions embodying the invention which have particularly excellent hand cleansing properties are given below.Formulation A W V Synperonic A9 ICl 1 10.0 Glycerine BP 1.0 Cocoamide Witco 2 8.0 neutralised with 80 Lactic Acid Benzoic Acid preservative 0.2 Water, ad 100.0 1 a 9 mole ethoxylated C13 15 commercial linear alcohol 2 the aide derived fro coconut oilThis produces an acceptable viscid liquid with adequate cosmetic effects.

Compositions embodying the present invention can be extremely affective hand cleansers which can be used with safety, prepared at much lower costs and used much more economically than many conventional hand cleansers and can be provided with desired cosmetic effects merely by ad3usting at will the viscosity and emolliency. In addition the amount of active ingredient required to be presnt in a composition embodying the present invention may be such less than that present in many conventional hand cleansing compositions to achieve good results, or put another way, the anount of compositions emhodying the invention required to be placed on the hands to achieve the desired result is up to four times less than that of some conventional handcleansing compositions containing the same concentration of active ingredient. Thus, the smaller capacity dispensers fr dispensing hand lotions which dispense up to about 2 ml of composition , rather than the larger dispensers for dispensing conventional hand cleansers which will dispense between 4 to 28 ml , can be effectively employed. s formulation ..bodying the invention containing 10 or less of condensate can be as effective in cleansing hands soiled with oil and or grey as a conventional hydrocarbon composition containing, eg, 30 of kerosene. Inde an amount of a formulation embodying the invention containing a 9 mole ethoxylated condensate that one halt of a formulation containing 10 kerosene can achieve comparable cleaning results.
