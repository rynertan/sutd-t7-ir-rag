## Description
SK I 3002 WITH BEMOVBBLE INNER SHOES This invention relates to a ski boot with removable inner shoe, As is known, ski boots currently comprise a shell formed from a mainly rigid plastic material and a soft shoe inserted therein which may be pulled out of the shell for conveniently drying it and any other needs. With prior ski boots, it is not infrequent for the withdrawal movement of the foot from the inner shoe, after use, to result in the inner shoe being incidentally dragged out of the boot, particularly with rear entry ski boots. It is an object of this invention to obviate such prior disadvantages by providing a device, which while allowing, where necessary, withdrawal of the inner shoe from the boot, can prevent unintentional removal of the inner shoe from the shell of a ski boot. A further object of the invention is to provide such a device, which can retain the ability for relative movements between the boot shell and inner shoe, as required when a skier is to lean forward. Another object of this invention is to provide a device as indicated, which poses no special handling problems, and can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a ski boot with removable inner shoe, characterized by a device for securing the inner shoe inside the ski boot, comprising a first coupling member 2,3,4 associated with a shell 1 of a ski boot, and a second coupling member 11,13 correspondingly arranged on an inner shoe 10 , said cou pling members 2 4,11 , 13 being removably connectable to each other0 Further features and advantages will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description of a device for securing an inner shoe inside a ski boot, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 shows diagrammatically a ski boot shell and an inner shoe prior to their mutual coupling together Figure 2 shows the inner shoe as coupled to the ski boot and Figure 3 is an enlarged scale detail view showing the securing device in the act of coupling the inner shoe and boot together. Making reference to the drawing views, the device for securing an inner shoe inside a ski boot, according to the invention, comprises a first coupling member in the form of an insertion element associated with a shell 1 of a ski boot, the ski boot being preferably of a type having a front leg portion and a rear leg portion, not shown in the drawing, which are hingedly connected in la to the shell 1 and mutually coupleable together. The cited insertion element includes a lug or tongue 2 of elongate configuration which extends from the shell 1 upwards preferably at the rear of said shell 1 and is preferably made integral with the shell 1. The lug 2 iR provided, at the top end thereof, with an inclined lead in surface 3 which merges with a nose or tab 4 made integral therewith and extending downwardly and being spaced apart from base portion 2a of the lug 2. Correspondingly provided on the inner shoe 10 is a second coupling member in the form of an enclosure including a loop or bridge formation 11 extending across and made integral with the rear portion of the inner shoe 10, and specifically at a rear flap 12 thereof, to define in cooperation with said flap a throughgoing slot 13. Through said slot 13 there may be inserted, as shown in Figure 2, said lug 2, the operation being made easier by the provision of the inclined lead ih surface 3 and the inherent elasticity of the material of at least some portions thereof. The insertion is performed so as to introduce the whole nose 4 fully through the slot 13, untill the free bottom end of the nose has passed the bridge 11. To complete the coupling after the insertion as above described, the flap 12 and the loop 11 are moved slightly upwards with respect to the shell thereby the loop 11 is received in the space delimited between the nose or tab 4 and lug 2, with allowance for a limited relative sliding movement as required when the skier leans forward, since small displacement movements of the inner shoe are allowed along the longitudinal axis. As an alternative, the loop 11 may be made of a material having a suitable elasticity degree ao that the relative movement between the inner shoe and the shell is obtained by elastic yielding of the loop. Thus, it may be appreciated that with the arrangement just described, on drawing one s foot out of the inner shoe 10, the shoe 10 cannot be dragged unintentionally out of the shell because of the bridge 11 engaging at the upper portion of the space defined by the tab 4 and lug 2, thus maintaining the coupled condition. Of course, where one wishes to withdraw the inner shoe from the boot shell, it will be sufficient to push downwards on the inner shoe so as to enable the bridge to clear the tab 4 during its successive upward movement, thereby the inner shoe mag be released for withdrawal as normal. It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular that a securing device has been provided which may be constructed in a most simple manner, by directly providing an engagement element on the shell and facing housing on the inner shoe, thus achieving a stable coupling of the two while allowing for the necessary relative movements between the inner shoe and boot shell. In practicing the invention, the materials used, if compatible with the intended application, and the dimensions and contingent shapes may be any selected ones to meet individual requirements.
