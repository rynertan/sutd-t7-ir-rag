# METHOD FOR PRODUCING ORIENTED ISLANDS OF SINGLE CRYSTAL FILMS

## Abstract
The invention is a method for producing a thin film semi conductor material on an amorphous substrate 10 having a predetermined crystallographic orientation. The method includes forming a plurality of crystalline material islands 14 on the surface 18 of an amorphous substrate 10 , forming a wall 20 around each island 14 of crystalline material with a material 16 having a higher melting temperature, then laser melting the crystalline material to promote the predetermined crystallographic orientation upon cooling. The walls 20 confine the thin layer of crystalline material 16 during laser melting, thereby pre serving the straight edges and square corners necessary to promote the formation of the preferred crystallographic orientation upon cooling such as the 100 orientation of silicon.
