# Continuous flow method.

## Abstract
A continuous flow method and apparatus in which a fluid stream comprising segments of liquids R₁ S R₂ B separated by intervening segments of immiscible fluid A₁ A ₂ A ₂ eg gas, is flowed through a conduit 100 . The conduit has three sequential sections 102, 104, 106 . As the stream passes from the first 102 into the second 104 section, some of the liquid segments R₁ S R₂ are caused to combine whereas others R₁ S R₂ B are maintained separate. In the third section 106 , the combined segments R₁ S R₂ are thoroughly mixed. The technique allows the mixing of selected liquid segments within the fluid stream, whilst maintaining separation of other segments, so permitting two stage reactions to be performed without inter sample carryover.
