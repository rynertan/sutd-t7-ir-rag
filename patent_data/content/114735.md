# VARIABLE ASPECT DISPLAY

## Abstract
The light incident upon a lenticular parallax panorama gram variable aspect display device 10 is imaged upon the object field 20 and then distributed in part across portions of the object field 20 outside the images. Adjustment is made for the rate at which the display changes as a function both of the rate of movement of the viewer past the display device 10 , and of the instantaneous absolute angular position of the viewer with resepect thereto. Adjustments can also be made for paralax, lens circular aberration at off center viewing angles, differential thermal expansions within the device 10 , and display changes due to changes in ambient conditions. Each lens element 18 is preferably provided with its own exclusive object field 22 .
