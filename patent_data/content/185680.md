## Description
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the entrapment of compounds in liposomes composed of salt forms of organic acid derivatives of sterols that are capable of forming bilayers. Sterols such as cholesterol or other lipids, to which a hydrophilic moiety such as a salt form of an organic acid is attached, can be used to prepare suspensions of multilamellar or small unilamellar vesicles. The sterol liposomes of the present invention may be prepared with or without the use of organic solvents. These vesicles may entrap water soluble compounds, partially water soluble compounds, and water insoluble compounds. The sterol vesicles described herein are particularly useful for the entrapment of biologically active compounds or pharmaceutical compounds which can be administered Liposomes are completely closed bilayer membranes containing an encapsulated aqueous phase. Liposomes may be any variety of multilamellar vesicles onion like structures characterized by concentric membrane bilayers each separated by an aqueous layer or unilamellar vesicles possessing a single membrane bilayer . Two parameters of liposome preparations are functions of vesicle size and lipid concentration 1 Captured volume, defined as the volume enclosed by a given amount of lipid, is expressed as units of liters entrapped per mole of total lipid 1 mol ¹ . The captured volume depends upon the radius of the liposomes which in turn is affected by the lipid composition of the vesicles and the ionic composition of the medium. 2 Encapsulation efficiency, defined as the fraction of the aqueous compartment sequestered by the bilayers, is expressed as a percentage. The encapsulation efficiency is directly proportional to the lipid concentration when more lipid is present, more solute can be sequestered within liposomes. See Deamer and Uster, 1983, Liposome Preparation Methods and Mechanisms, in The original method for liposome preparation Bangham et al., 1965, J. Mol. Biol. In attempts to increase captured volume or encapsulation efficiency a number of methods for the preparation of liposomes comprising physpholipid bilayers have been developed however, all methods require the use of organic solvents. Some of these methods are briefly described below. An effort to increase the encapsulation efficiency involved first forming liposome precursors or micelles, In another attempt to maximize the encapsulation efficiency, Papahadjopoulos U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871 issued November 25, 1980 describes a reverse phase evaporation process for making oligolamellar lipid vesicles also known as reverse phase evaporation vesicles hereinafter referred to as REVs . According to this procedure, the aqueous material to be encapsulated is added to a mixture of polar lipid in an organic solvent. Then a homogeneous water in oil type of emulsion is formed and the organic solvent is evaporated until a gel is formed. The gel is then converted to a suspension by dispersing the gel like mixture in an aqueous media. The REVs produced consist mostly of unilamellar vesicles large unilamellar vesicles, or LUVs and some oligolamellar vesicles which are characterized by only a few concentric bilayers with a large internal aqueous space. Much has been written regarding the possibilities of using liposomes for drug delivery systems. See, for example, the disclosures in U.S. Patent No. 3,993,754 issued on November 23, 1976, to Yeuh Erh Rahman and Elizabeth A. Cerny, and U.S. Patent No. 4,145,410 issued on March 20, 1979, to Barry D. Sears. In a liposome drug delivery system the medicament is entrapped during liposome formation and then administered to the patient to be treated. The medicament may be soluble in water or in a non polar solvent. Typical of such disclosures are U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871 issued November 25, 1980, to Papahadjopoulos and Szoka and U.S. Patent No. 4,224,179, issued September 23, 1980 to M. Schneider. When preparing liposomes for use A variety of sterols and their water soluble derivatives have been used for cosmetic, pharmaceutical and diagnostic purposes. Of the water soluble sterols, for example, branched fatty acid cholesterol esters, steroid esters and PEG phytosterols have been used in cosmetic preparations European Patent Application No. 28,456 U.S. Patent No. 4,393,044 and Schrader, Drug and Cosmetic Industry, September 1983, p.33 and October 1983, p.46 . Thakkar and Kuehn 1969, J. Pharm. Sci. 58 7 850 852 disclose the solubilization of steroid hormones using aqueous solutions of steroidal non ionic surfactants, specifically ethoxylated cholesterol Cholesterol and other sterols, have also been incorporated into phospholipid liposome membranes in order to alter the physical properties of the lipid bilayers. For example, in a recent abstract, Ellens et al. 1984, Biophys. J. However, the ability to efficiently entrap bioactive agents in sterol vesicles which are suitable for administation The present invention involves methods and compositions for the entrapment of various compounds in liposomes, the bilayers of which comprise salt forms of organic acid derivatives of sterols. Entrapment of a compound is defined herein as the encapsulation of a water soluble compound in the aqueous compartment of the liposome or the entrapment of a water insoluble compound within the sterol bilayer. The sterol liposomes of the present invention are particularly useful for the administration of the entrapped compound The method for preparing the sterol vesicles involves adding to an aqueous buffer a salt form of an organic acid derivative of a sterol capable of forming closed bilayers in an amount sufficient to form completely closed bilayers which entrap an aqueous compartment. A suspension of multilamellar vesicles is formed by shaking the mixture. The formation of vesicles is facilitated if the aqueous buffer also contains the counterion of the salt in solution. Furthermore, if the dissociated salt form of the organic acid derivative of a sterol is negatively charged at neutral pH, the aqueous buffer should be essentially free of divalent or multivalent cations. Similarly, when the dissociated salt form of the organic acid derivative of a sterol is positively charged at neutral pH, the aqueous buffer should be essentially free of multivalent anions. The application of energy to the suspension, In order to entrap a water soluble compound, a partially water soluble compound or a water insoluble compound in the sterol vesicles of the present invention, a number of approaches are possible. Compounds which either partition into the sterol bilayers The sterol liposomes of the present invention are particularly advantageous when used to entrap water insoluble bioactive agents or those that are sparingly soluble in water. This enables the administration Accordingly, the present invention provides steroïdal liposomes comprising completely closed bilayers substantially comprising a salt form of an organic acid derivative of a sterol. The present invention affords a number of advantages in that the sterol vesicles FIG. 1 graphically demonstrates the inverse relationship of the captured solute chromium and the concentration of cholesterol hemisuccinate used to prepare the multilamellar liposomes. FIG. 2 represents the X ray diffraction patterns obtained for four different CHS MLV preparations. FIG. 3 represents the electron spin resonance data for CHS multilamellar vesicles and EPC multilamellar vesicles. FIG. 4 graphically demonstrates the swelling profiles of cholesterol hemisuccinate liposomes and egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes in aqueous buffers of various tonicity. FIG. 5 graphically illustrates the effectiveness of indomethacin entrapped in cholesterol hemisuccinate liposomes in reducing joint swelling when administered intramuscularly. FIG. 6 represents the organ distribution of ¹⁴C diazepam administered intravenously in mice either unencapsulated free or encapsulated in CHS SUVs. FIG. 7 A, B and C, represent the organ distribution of ⁵¹Chromium administered intravenously in mice either, encapsulated in CHS MLVs FIG. 7A or encapsulated in EPC SPLVs FIG. 7B or unencapsulated FIG. 7C . The present invention describes methods and compositions for the entrapment of water soluble, partially water soluble, or water insoluble compounds in liposomes, the bilayers or which comprise salt forms of organic acid derivatives of sterols that are capable of forming closed bilayers. Accordingly, the sterol liposomes of the present invention can be prepared to 1 entrap a water soluble compound in the aqueous compartment or 2 entrap a water insoluble compound which partitions into the sterol bilayers or 3 both entrap a water soluble compound and entrap a water insoluble compound in one liposome preparation. Any salt form of an organic acid derivative of a sterol which is capable of forming completely closed bilayers in aqueous solutions To determine definitively that entrapment within the aqueous compartment of any liposome has occurred, the following criteria have been established See Sessa and Weissmann, 1970, J. Biol. Chem. 245 3295 a there must be a clear separation of free from sequestered compound as assayed by gel filtration b there must be no hydrophobic or charge charge interaction between the outermost vesicle bilayer and the entrapped compound since this may result in a failure to achieve separation of the free compound from the liposomes by molecular sieving, thereby artificially increasing the apparent sequestration or encapsulation efficiency. To eliminate this possibility it must be shown that the water soluble compound added to a suspension of previously formed liposomes does not coelute with preformed liposomes c disruption of gel filtered liposomes by use of detergents or other membrane perturbants must induce a shift in the gel filtration pattern of the sequestered molecule from a position coincident with the liposome peak to one that coelutes with the free molecule. Generally any sterol which can be modified by the attachment of an organic acid may be used in the practice of the present invention. For example, such sterols include but are not limited to cholesterol, vitamin D, phytosterols including but not limited to sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and the like , steroid hormones, and the like. Organic acids which can be used to derivatize the sterols include but are not limited to the carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, polycarboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, amino acids and polyamino acids. Because the salt forms increase the water solubility of organic acids, any organic acid may be used to derivatize the sterols however an advantage may be obtained if the organic acid moiety itself is water soluble. Such water soluble organic acid moieties include but are not limited to water soluble aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric acids and the like The organic acid can be linked to an hydroxyl group of the sterol via an ester or an ether bond using conventional methods see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,859,047 U.S. Patent No. 4,040,784 U.S. Patent No. 4,042,330 U.S. Patent No. 4,183,847 and U.S. Patent No. 4,189,400 . The salt forms of the derivatized sterols can be prepared by dissolving both the organic acid derivative of the sterol and the counterion of the salt The sterol liposomes of the present invention may be prepared by adding to an aqueous phase a salt form of an organic acid derivative of a sterol capable of forming bilayers so that the derivatized sterol is present in an amount sufficient to form vesicles In complete contrast to reported methods for multilamellar vesicle formation As previously explained, the tris salt form of any organic acid derivative of a sterol may be advantageously used in the practice of the present invention. For example, the tris salt form of a sterol hemi dicarboxylic acid such as a sterol hemisuccinate or a mixture of sterol hemisuccinates are particularly useful for forming the vesicle bilayers of the steroidal liposomes to be administered According to the present invention, the entrapment of water soluble compounds, water insoluble compounds, or sparingly soluble compounds in liposomes composed of the salt form of organic acid derivatives of sterols may be accomplished in a number of ways Using any of the four method described above, both a water soluble compound and a water insoluble compound may be entrapped in one sterol liposome preparation. According to the methods described above for the entrapment of water insoluble compounds using the sterol vesicles of the present invention, it is According to one embodiment of the present invention, sterol liposomes are prepared using the tris salt form of cholesterol hemisuccinate as follows 4.5 to 200 mg of the tris salt form of cholesterol hemisuccinate is added per mℓ or aqueous buffer containing 0.01 M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl. The mixture is shaken and a milky suspension of cholesterol hemisuccinate multilamellar vesicles forms. The vesicles may be pelleted by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with aqueous buffer. The suspension of cholesterol hemisuccinate multilamellar vesicles CHS MLVs may be sonicated The compounds which are entrapped according to the method of the present invention may be used in various ways. For example, if the compound is a bioactive agent, the sterol liposome entrapped compound may be administered Virtually any bioactive agent can be entrapped within the sterol liposomes of the present invention. Such agents include but are not limited to antibacterial agents, antiviral agents, antifungal agents, anti parasitic agents, tumoricidal agents, anti metabolites, polypeptides, peptides, proteins, toxins, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, immunoglobulins, immunomodulators, vasodilators, dyes, radiolabels, radio opaque compounds, fluorescent compounds, receptor binding molecules, anti inflammatories, antiglaucomic agents, mydriatic compounds, local anesthetics, narcotics, vitamins, nucleic acids, polynucleotides, etc. The entrapment of two or more compounds simultaneously may be especially desirable where such compounds produce complementary or synergistic effects. The sterol liposome entrapped agent may be administered In another example of their use, the sterol liposome entrapped compound may be incorporated into a broad range of materials including but not limited to other lipid vesicles or liposomes, gels, oils, emulsions and the like. For instance, the suspension of sterol liposomes containing the entrapped compound may be added to the aqueous phase as an ingredient in any type of liposome preparation Other uses, depending upon the particular properties of a preparation, may be envisioned by those skilled in the art. For example, because of their divalent cation sensitivity, the cholesterol hemisuccinate liposomes of the present invention may be made to entrap indicator dyes which are sensitive to divalent cation sensitive for use in colorimetric diagnostic assays The following examples are given for purposes of illustration and not by way of limiting the scope of the invention. The following subsections describe the preparation of cholesterol hemisuccinate vesicles which entrap arsenazo III, inulin or chromium. Parameters such as the encapsulation efficiency and the captured volume are assessed the calcium dependent instability of the cholesterol vesicles is demonstrated. Freeze etch electron microscopy, X ray diffraction and electron spin resonance of the cholesterol hemisuccinate vesicles are also described. The following subsections describe the preparation of CHS liposomes using various salt forms of cholesterol hemisuccinate. In all examples involving the tris salt form of cholesterol hemisuccinate hereinafter referred to as tris salt CHS the tris salt CHS was either purchased from Sigma Biochemicals, St. Louis, MO, and used without purification or synthesized as follows 30 mℓ of a 3.3 molar solution of Tris base was added to 1.5 liters of a 67 M molar solution of cholesterol hydrogen succinate ICN, Cleveland, Ohio in ether. The resulting solution was rotoevaporated to a wet residue and lyophilized for 12 hours. The resulting tris salt CHS was recrystallized three times from ethyl acetate. Residual ethyl acetate was removed by heating to 56 C under vacuum 0.1 mm Hg . Tris salt CHS 54 mg was added to a 1 mℓ solution of arsenazo III 4.5 mM, final concentration in 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl. A milky suspension of CHS MLVs was formed by mechanical shaking. The CHS MLVs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed three times using 10 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl. The resulting pellet was red in color indicating entrapment of the arsenazo III. The 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol salt of cholesterol hemisuccinate 50 mg was added to a 1 mℓ solution of arsenazo III 4.5 mM, final concentration in 0.01 M 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol HCl pH 7.3 , 0.07 M KCl, 0.07 M NaCl. The suspension of CHS MLVs was formed by mixing vortically with glass beads. The CHS MLVs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed three times as described in Section 6.1.1. The resulting pellet was in color indicating entrapment of the arsenazo III. The 2 aminoethanol salt of cholesterol hemisuccinate 50 mg was added to a 1 mℓ solution of arsenazo III 4.5 mM, final concentration in 0.01 M 2 aminoethanol HCl pH 7.3 , 0.07 M KCl, 0.07 M NaCl. The suspension of CHS MLVs was formed by mixing vortically with glass beads. The CHS MLVs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed three times as described in Section 6.1.1. The resulting pellet was red in color indicating entrapment of the arsenazo III. The bis tris propane salt of cholesterol hemisuccinate 50 mg was added to a 1 mℓ solution of arsenazo III 4.5 mM, final concentration in 0.01 M bis tris propane HCl pH 7.3 , 0.07 M KCl, 0.07 M NaCl. The suspension of CHS MLVs was formed by mixing vortically with glass beads. The CHS MLVs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed three times as described in Section 6.1.1. The resulting pellet was red in color indicating entrapment of the arsenazo III. The triethanolamine salt of cholesterol hemisuccinate 50 mg was added to a 1 mℓ solution of arsenazo III 4.5 mM, final concentration in 0.01 M triethanolamine HCL pH 7.3 , 0.07 M KCl, 0.07 M NaCl. The suspension of CHS MLVs was formed by mixing vortically with glass beads. The CHS MLVs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed three times as described in Section 6.1.1. The resulting pellet was red in color indicating entrapment of the arsenazo III. The free base of miconazole was prepared as follows an aqueous solution of NaOH was titrated into a suspension of miconazole nitrate in ether. The ether phase was collected and the ether was evaporated leaving an oil comprising the miconazole free base. The oil was then added to ethanol containing cholesterol hydrogen succinate. The ethanol was evaporated leaving a film comprising the salt form of miconazole cholesterol hemisuccinate. Then a saline solution was added to the film. After extensive vortical mixing, vesicles were observed in the solution. CHS MLVS were prepared as described in Sections 6.1.1., 6.1.2., 6.1.3., 6.1.4., and 6.1.5., except that the arsenazo III was omitted. Each final pellet of vesicles was resuspended in 2 mℓ of the buffer in which it was prepared and sonicated in a bath sonicator until the milky suspension turned clear indicating the conversion of CHS MLVs to CHS SUVs. CHS was dispersed in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 at a concentration of 100 mg mℓ. This material was extruded 10 times through a 30 nm nucleopore filter resulting in CHS SUVs. Cholesterol hemisuccinate multilamellar vesicles CHS MLVs incorporating ³H Inulin as the entrapped agent were prepared as follows ³H Inulin 3.7 x 10⁷Bq mℓ 1.0 mCi mℓ, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA was dissolved in 2 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl. Then 40 mg of tris salt CHS was added to the solution and the resulting mixture was mechanically dispersed by shaking. A milky suspension formed indicating the formation of multilamellar vesicles. The suspension was allowed to stand undisturbed for 2 hours at which time the suspension was diluted to a final volume of 10 mℓ using 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl. The radioactivity of a 10µℓ aliquot was determined to be 24,625 cpm 10 µℓ by adding the aliquot to 10 mℓ scintillation fluid 40 g Omnifluor New England Nuclear, Boston, MA 6 ℓ toluene, 4ℓ ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and assaying radioactivity using a Beckmann L6800 liquid scintillation counter with windows set at 0.400. Radioactivity in counts per minute cpm was converted to disintergrations per minute dpm by applying the H method of quench correction Horrock, D.L. The Number Concept, Beckman Instruments, 1977 . The CHS MLVs were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes. The resulting pellet was washed three times by resuspending the pellet in 10 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl and repelletting by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes. The washed pellet of vesicles was resuspended in 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl to a final volume of 10 mℓ the radioactivity of a 10 µℓ aliquot was determined to be 3,442 cpm 10 µℓ. Therefore, a total of approximately 14 of the starting ³H Inulin was entrapped in the CHS MLVs. The encapsulation efficiencies of inulin entrapped in MLVs comprising varying concentrations of cholesterol hemisuccinate were compared to encapsulation efficiencies of inulin entrapped in MLVs comprising varing concentrations of egg phosphatidylcholine. Multilamellar vesicles composed of either egg phosphatidylcholine EPC or tris salt CHS were prepared using identical protocols in order to compare encapsulation efficiencies. Accordingly, tris salt CHS at a concentration of 40, 80, 160, 320 or 400 mg in 2.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer with 5 µℓ ³H inulin 8x10⁹Bq mg 217.0 mCi mg was mixed vortically and allowed to stand for 2 hours, forming CHS MLVs with ³H inulin as the entrapped compound. An additional 3 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer was added to the suspension which was left at room temperature overnight. Then, approximately 3.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer was added to bring the total volume up to 10 mℓ. Multilamellar vesicles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine EPC MLVs Avanti, Birmingham, AL were prepared according to the following protocol 40, 80, 160, 320 or 400 mg mℓ EPC was suspended in sufficient choloroform to completely dissolve the phospholipid. The choloroform was evaporated to dryness leaving a waxy deposit on the test tube. Then 2.0 mℓ of 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer with 5 µℓ ³H Inulin 217.0 mCi mg was added, the mixture allowed to swell , and the resulting EPC MLVs were dispersed by extensive vortical mixing. An additional 3 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer was added to the suspension which was left at room temperature overnight. Then, the mixture was brought up to a total volume of 10 mℓ with 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. The encapsulation efficiency of ³H inulin by the CHS MLVs and EPC MLVs was determined as follows The radioactivity in the 20 µℓ aliquot of each initial mixture of ingredients was determined by scintillation counting as previously described. After formation, the liposomes were pelleted by centrifuging the suspension for 10 20 minutes at 10,000 x g, each pellet was washed four times in 10 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer, and resuspended to a final volume of 10 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. The radioactivity of a 20 µℓ aliquot of this final washed sample was determined. The fraction of the initial radioactivity measured in this final sample represented the ³H inulin entrapped in the lipid vesicles. As illustrated in Table I, an increase in encapsulation efficiency is proportional to an increase in CHS concentration but, more importantly, CHS MLVs made using 20 200 mg mℓ CHS demonstrate a higher encapsulation efficiency for inulin than do EPC MLVs made using the same concentration of phospholipid. In order to determine whether the encapsulation efficiency of CHS MLVs was influenced by the amount of time the CHS was in contact with free ³H Inulin in aqueous buffer, CHS MLVs were prepared as follows either 80 or 300 mg tris salt CHS was mixed vortically in 20 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl buffer containing 10 µℓ ³H Inulin 8x10⁹Bq mg 217 mCi mg specific radioactivity , thus forming CHS MLVs using a concentration of 40 and 150 mg mℓ CHS respectively. Five samples at each of the two lipid concentrations were prepared and the CHS MLV suspensions were allowed to stand at room temperature in the 2.0 mℓ of 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. At the following time intervals 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, the samples were brought up to 10 mℓ with the same buffer. An initial 10 µℓ aliquot of each sample was removed for scintillation counting as previously described. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes, and each pellet was washed four times in 10 mℓ buffer. The final pellet was suspended in buffer to a final volume of 10 mℓ, and the radioactivity of a 10 µℓ aliquot of each final sample was compared to that of the initial sample at each time point. The results demonstrated no significant difference in encapsulation efficiency for the five time points for either concentration of lipid tested. This indicates that entrapment of about 12 or 20 of the initial ³H Inulin added to the preparation occurred regardless of contact time at 40 or 150 mg mℓ CHS respectively. This demonstrates that unlike conventional MLVs prepared using egg phosphatidylcholine, no swelling time is required in the preparation of CHS MLVs. Small unilamellar vesicles composed of cholesterol hemisuccinate CHS SUVs containing ³H Inulin as the entrapped agent were prepared as follows 100 µℓ of 3.7x10⁷Bq mℓ 1.0 mCi mℓ ³H Inulin New England Nuclear, Boston MA was dissolved in 2.5 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl to which either 100 or 200 mg tris salt CHS was added. After mixing voritically with glass beads, the mixture was drawn off from the beads in the pipette, and sonicated to clarity, In order to demonstrate inulin entrapment see Section 5 supra , the CHS SUVs were separated from unentrapped inulin by gel filtration as follows each liposome suspension was applied separately to a Bio Gel A 15m, 100 200 mesh agarose column Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA with an operating range of 40,000 to 15,000,000 daltons molecular weight, equilibrated and calibrated with 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. Then, 1 mℓ fractions which eluted from the column were collected and the radioactivity of a 10 µℓ aliquot of each fraction was determined as previously described. A clear separation of free from sequestered inulin was obtained by the gel filtration thus indicating the entrapment of the inulin in the CHS SUVs. This analysis indicated that about 1 of the inulin was entrapped in the CHS SUVs. Cholesterol hemisuccinate multilamellar vesicles incorporating ⁵¹Chromium as the entrapped agent were prepared as follows 15.0, 40.0, 65.8, 100.0, 175.0, 263.2, 526.4 or 658.0 µmoles of tris salt CHS was added to 5 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl, pH 7.3, containing trace amounts of ⁵¹Chromium New England Nuclear, Boston, MA and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours, resulting in a suspension of CHS MLVs containing ⁵¹Chromium entrapped. In order to determine the encapsulation efficiency of the CHS MLVs prepared in Section 6.4 samples of each preparation were pipetted into dialysis bags Thomas Scientific, Catalog No. 3787 D22, molecular weight cut off of 12,000 daltons that had been boiled three times in distilled water. The samples in the dialysis bags were initially counted in a gamma counter TmAnalytic, model no. 1191 . The samples were then dialyzed for 20 hours against the same 0.01M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl pH 7.3, buffer in retentate dialysate ratios of greater than 1 150, respectively the dialysate was changed every 2 hours for the first 6 hours. Encapsulation efficiency was determined by computing the percentage of initial counts retained. As indicated in Table II, an increase in encapsulation efficiency is proportional to an increase in CHS concentration. The captured volume of the CHS vesicles prepared as described in Section 6.4.1. was determined for each concentration of cholesterol hemisuccinate by computing the captured solute using the following calculation The data illustrated in FIG. 1 indicate that less chromium mole of lipid is entrapped as the concentration of tris salt CHS is increased. Thus, although an increase in the encapsulation efficiency is proportional to the increase in lipid concentration, the captured solute decreases as the lipid concentration increases. The number of trials per point are indicated in parenthesis next to each point. Samples of CHS MLVs and CHS SUVs, prepared using the tris salt of cholesterol hemisuccinate as described in Section 6.1. except that the inulin was omitted, were prepared for freeze etch electron microscopy for freeze etch method See Pfenninger et al., 1975, J. Cell Biol. Electron microscopy of the CHS MLV freeze etched preparation revealed discrete units bounded by at lease one lamella, The larger vesicles could be categorized into a number of classes including those with one or a few outer lamellae, and those with many lamellae. Most of the larger vesicles had substantial areas inside with a grainy appearance, possibly indicating the aqueous chambers. In many instances, small vesicles or groups of small vesicles were apparent, more or less free inside the larger vesicles, sometimes four or five layers deep. This apparent nesting is commonly observed in conventional liposomes made with a negatively charged phospholipid. Occasionally, zones of closely apposed lamellae could be seen. These appear similar in all respects to the lamellae of conventional phospholipid MLVs. The sonicated samples examined also contained many small spheroids ranging from 50 nm to 500 nm. These vesicles probably compare to SUVs made by sonication of phospholipid MLVs. As the smaller CHS vesicles did not cleave, it was impossible to discern the structure of the interior or their component lamellae. The CHS vesicles which were extruded through the 30 nm filter 10 times vesicles with an average size of about 65 nm were observed. This contrasts with CHS vesicles prepared by the French press procedure which were extremely small average diameter of 25 nm or less . X ray diffraction of various CHS MLV preparations was performed using the 2 dimensional image intensified X ray detector apparatus described elsewhere Gruner, S.M. 1977, PhD thesis, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 09540 USA Reynolds, Geo. T., Milch, J.R. and Gruner, S.M, 1978, Rev. Sci. Instr. 49 1241 1249 Tilcock, C.P.T., Bally, M.B., Farren, S.B., Cullis, P.R. and Gruner, S.M., 1984, Biochem, 23 2696 2703 . X ray repeat spacings are expressed as 0,05 nm 0.5 Å . CHS dispersions were held in 1.5 mm glass X ray capillaries sealed with epoxy plugs. Specimens were hydrated either gently or vigorously. For gentle hydration, the buffer was layered via a syringe onto dry CHS in the bottom of the X ray capillary. The capillary was then momentarily centrifuged in a table top centrifuge to eliminate air bubbles from the lipid water paste. The capillaries were then sealed and allowed to equilibrate for at least 4 hours at 5 C. Vigorous hydration was accomplished by vortexing dry CHS with buffer and two glass mixing beads in a test tube. An aliquot was then transfered to an X ray capillary. X ray diffraction demonstrated that hydrated CHS forms multilamellar structures. FIG. 2a and 2b show the low angle diffraction which resulted from gently hydrated specimens composed of 68.9 and 59.1 , CHS, respectively, by weight. Up to four equally spaced orders of diffraction are visible, consistent with multilamellar arrays of 6.81 nm 68.1 Å and 7.98 nm 79.8 Å , repeats, respectively. The orders were sharp and well resolved, indicating that the lattice contained very little disorder. These concentrated CHS specimens were of a uniform paste like appearance with no visible excess buffer, consistent with the fact that the repeat specing increased as the aqueous content increased. At very high aqueous concentrations, gently hydrated CHS specimens exhibited a clearly visible pool of excess buffer solution on top of the hydrated lipid. The diffraction from such a sample 20.2 CHS by total weight is shown in FIG. 2c. The broadening of the higher angle diffraction peaks is indicative of considerable disorder in the lattice. The disorder in the lattice made a definitive lattice assignment difficult, but if a lamellar fit was made, as indicated in FIG. 2c, the repeat was about 8.6 nm 86 Å , suggestive of large aqueous spaces between the lipid bilayers. If, instead of using gentle hydration, a 20.7 CHS specimen was prepared by mixing the dry lipid vortically with the buffer, then the specimen which resulted had a uniform milky appearance. As shown in FIG. 2d, the low angle diffraction exhibited a broad band of scatter with little evidence of a sharply defined lattice. A similar diffraction signature would be expected from a multilamellar system in which the interlamellar aqueous width varied widely. The x ray diffraction of the dilute CHS dispersions is most consistently interpreted as arising from a multilamellar system in which the interlamellar forces are weak. For other lipid systems, such as dilute egg phosphatidylcholine dispersions, the x ray diffraction pattern indicates a sharply defined lamellar lattice which is, by weight, mostly lipid Rand, 1981 Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 10 277 314 . This well defined lattice repeat is a result of a relatively sharp minimum in the lattice potential as a function of the lipid layer separation. If the potential vs. distance curve has only a shallow well, then one expects weak interlamellar forces and considerable lattice disorder. This appears to be the case with CHS vesicles. The specimen of FIG. 2d has about an 8.6 nm 86 Å repeat, as compared to the 6.81 nm 68.1 Å repeat of FIG. 2a. This indicates that in the presence of excess buffer, CHS liposomes have a large water to lipid ratio. Similar results are observed with other charged lipid systems Rand, 1981 supra . Multilamellar liposomes made of egg phosphatidylcholine EPC Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL were spin labelled and compared to similarly labeled tris salt CHS MLVs prepared essentially as described previously. In the case of EPC MLVs, 1 mole percent of either 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 or 16 doxylstearate Molecular Probes, Junction City, OR was added to 40 mg lipid in chloroform and the resulting solution dried to a thin film by rotary evaporation. Then 2 ml of Tris HCl buffer was used to hydrate this film by vortexing until the film was completely suspended. The resulting EPC MLVs were washed twice prior to spectroscopy. In the case of CHS MLVs, 1 mole of the appropriate spin label in ethanol was dried to a thin film on the side of a test tube to which was added 40 mg of tris salt CHS powder and 2 mℓ of Tris HCl buffer. This suspension was vortexed and the resulting liposomes washed twice. All electron spin resonance experiments were carried out with an IBM Instruments ER100D ESR spectrometer. The order parameter S was calculated as described elsewhere Griffith and Jist in, Spin Labelling, Berliner, L.J. ed. , Academic Press, N.Y. 1976 . FIG. 3 shows the order parameter profiles of CHS MLVs and EPC MLVs as determined by spin labelling these preparations with either 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 or 16 doxylsterate. For EPC bilayers, the order parameter decreases with increasing carbon number into the bilayer, as has been previously reported. The supra molecular structure of CHS bilayers is markedly different not only is the bilayer dramatically more rigid than the EPC bilayer, but CHS systems actually exhibit an increase in order from the 50th to the 90th carbon, indicative of an entirely different physical and chemical bilayer structure than has previously been reported. In the following series of experiments the isotonic swelling behavior of cholesterol hemisuccinate and phospholipid multilamellar vesicles was compared After vortical mixing, each suspension of MLVs Results are graphically illustrated in FIG. 4 in which absorbance is plotted against the inverse of the KCl concentrations of the media to which the vesicles are exposed. Increased absorbance indicates swelling of lipid vesicles. Curves B and D demonstrate that, as expected the phospholipid MLVs The entrapment in CHS liposomes of compounds that are sparingly soluble in water is demonstrated for bovine growth hormone, insulin and tylosin. Bovine growth hormone BGH , a simple protein composed of a single chain of approximately 191 amino acids, is partially water soluble. The normal solubility is 1 to 1.5 mg mℓ at pH 8.0. BGH precipitates in organic solvents such as chloroform. CHS MLVs were prepared as described in Section 6.2. using 27 mg tris salt CHS in 1.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. The CHS MLV preparation was sonicated to clarity to form sonicated CHS SUVs and then either 5, 10, 15, 25, 30 or 166 mg BGH Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN was added to separate aliquots of the sonicated CHS SUV suspension. The suspensions were extensively mixed vortically, resulting in partitioning of the protein into the CHS SUV bilayers. The sonicated CHS SUV suspensions were visually observed for the presence of precipitate at 1, 2, and 21 days. No precipitate was observed, indicating that the bovine growth hormone remained entrapped in the CHS liposomes at all concentrations tested for 21 days at room temperature. Zinc insulin, a polypeptide hormone, although readily soluble in dilute acid or alkali, is practically insoluble in aqueous phases from pH 4.5 to 7.0. In fact the tendency of insulin solutions to form macroaggregates is an obstacle in the development of long term insulin delivery systems. CHS MLVs were prepared as described in Section 6.2. using 27 mg tris salt CHS in 1.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. The CHS MLV preparation was sonicated to carity to form sonicated CHS SUVs and up to 47 mg zinc insulin powder Bovine Pancreatic Insulin, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO was added to the CHS SUV suspension. The suspension was extensively mixed vortically, resulting in partitioning of the insulin into the CHS SUV bilayers. The sonicated CHS SUVs were visually observed for the presence of precipitate at 1, 2, and 21 days. No precipitate was observed indicating that insulin at a concentration of 5 mg mℓ remains entrapped for at least 21 days at room temperature. Insulin entrapment occurs more rapidly at 37 C. Tylosin is an antibiotic that is soluble in water at 25 C at 5 mg mℓ, and is also soluble in lower alcohols, esters and ketones, chlorinated hydrocarbons, benzene, and ether. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared as follows 100 mg tylosin base Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN and 200 mg tris salt CHS were mixed vortically in 4 mℓ phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 . The resulting milky suspension of CHS MLVs was sonicated with a probe tip sonicator for 15 minutes. As a precautionary measure, an ice bath was placed around the test tube to keep the temperature of the mixture down. The mixture was then placed into a bath sonicator for 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the 2 hour sonication period, the CHS SUV entrapped tylosin was separated from the suspension by centrifugation of the suspension at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes, forming a small pellet and an opalescent supernatant. The sonicated CHS SUVs in the supernatant were visually compared to a suspension of 100 mg tylosin base Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN added to the same volume of water. A precipitate formed in the suspension of tylosin base, however no precipitate formed in the CHS SUV tylosin preparation. Thus the tylosin appeared to remain entrapped for at least 48 hours. The entrapment of lipid soluble bioactive agents is demonstrated for indomethacin and diazepam. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is practically insoluble in water. The free acid of indomethacin is soluble in ehtanol, ether, acetone, and castor oil. CHS MLVs incorporating varying amounts of indomethacin as bioactive agent were prepared as follows in a round bottom flask, 27 mg tris salt CHS, 1 5 mg indomethacin, and 10 µℓ ¹⁴C indomethacin 8.1x10⁸Bq mmol 22.0 mCi mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA were combined. Sufficient methanol to dissolve all components was added. The mixture was then rotoevaporated to form a thin film on the vessel, and vacuum desiccated overnight to insure removal of all the methanol. Then CHS MLVs were formed by adding 1.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer to each flask. The suspensions were mixed vortically with glass beads, and allowed to stand undisturbed for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the relative amount of indomethacin entrapped in the CHS MLVs was determined as follows 9.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer was added to each sample and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 20 minutes at 10,000 x g. The resulting pellet was washed three times in 10 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer, and was suspended in a final volume of 1.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. A standard was prepared in the same manner as the samples except that Results indicate that up to 78 of the indomethacin can be entrapped in CHS MLVs. In order to determine whether the entrapped indomethacin altered the membrane vesicles, the CHS MLVs prepared in the presence of indomethacin see Section 8.1.1. were processed as previously described for freeze etch electron microscopy. In freeze etch electron microscopy, under low magnification, the empty CHS MLVs wer indistinguishable from those that have indomethacin included. That is, there was no obvious feature that one can discern to be unique to one or the other. At high magnification, however, the bilayer of the CHS MLVs containing indomethacin is distinctive. Because indomethacin is a water insoluble drug and is soluble in ehtanol, ether, acetone, and other non polar solvents, it can be expected that the indomethacin, in the presence of lipids, would be arranged such that it was sequestered from the water. Examination of the bilayers seen by electron microscopy indicated that the thickness of the bilayers varies in the cross fracture. This suggested that the indomethacin was indeed distributed in the lipid portion of the bilayers, such that it appeared to give an added thickness and a very non uniform configuration that is, the thickness varied as one bilayer was traced along a fracture line. This effect is presumably special for those drugs whose solubilities are such that they sequester in the lipid portion of the bilayers. Diazepam, a sedative or tranquilizer CHS SUVs incorporating diazepam were prepared as follows 2, 3, 4, or 5 mg diazepam was added to a test tube containing 5 µℓ ³H diazepam 2.8 x 10¹²Bq mmℓ 76.7 Ci mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA . Sufficient methanol was added to each tube to dissolve the drug maximum 2 mℓ methanol . The mixture was then rotoevaporated to a thin film, and desiccated overnight under vacuum to insure removal of all the methanol. The dried film was resuspended in 1 mℓ of a suspension of sonicated CHS SUVs prepared as described below using 50, 100, or 200 mg mℓ CHS , mixed vortically using glass beads and filtered using 0.22 µm Millipore filters Millipore Corp., New York, NY . The CHS SUVs were prepared according to the following protocol 50, 100, or 200 mg tris salt CHS was vortically mixed with 1.0 mℓ 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer. Using a probe sonicator, the mixture was sonicated to an optical density of about 0.40 measured at a wavelength of 550 nm The relative amount of diazepam that could be entrapped by the sonicated CHS SUVs was determined by comparison of the samples with a standard preparation. The standard preparation was prepared in the same manner as the samples except that Results indicate that both 100 and 200 mg mℓ CHS entrap 100 of the highest concentration of diazepam used 5 mg mℓ . Since both 100 and 200 mg mℓ CHS sufficiently entrap the diazepam, the 100 mg mℓ represents a more ideal concentration of CHS for entrapment of diazepam. It was observed that a relatively low concentration of CHS vesicles less than 1 µg mℓ CHS strongly agglutinated red blood cells RBC from a suspension in phosphate buffered saline PBS . Since CHS vesicles are precipitated by Ca and other cations such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, the CHS vesicles can be used to determine the concentration of aminoglycoside antibiotics in sera by In both situations, the exact amount of antibiotic could be established using a comparison with a standard curve derived from known concentrations of antibiotic. The basic experiments are described below Accordingly, 24 µℓ of gentamycin sulfate in PBS 1 mg mℓ was serially diluted in serum After about 10 minutes at room temperature, the turbidity of each mixture was recorded. Only mixtures containing 50 µg or more gentamycin showed a visible precipitation indicating that the CHS vesicles interacted with the gentamycin. Next, the precipitated material was pelleted and the supernatant was used to determine the concentration of the CHS SUVs by hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells. The hemagglutination assay was done in 96 U shaped microwell plates by serially diluting the vesicle suspensions to 50 µℓ PBS and then adding in each well 40 µℓ of 0.5 RBC in PBS. After 60 minutes at 4 C, hemagglutination was observed with an inverted mirror. The control RBC in the absence of CHS vesicles showed no hemagglutination. All samples containing CHS strongly hemagglutinated the RBC with the exception of those which, in the previous experiment, were turbid. This result indicated that CHS vesicles interacted with gentamycin such that relatively fewer vesicles were available for hemagglutination in comparison with the control suspension containing only CHS. The following subsections describe methods and compositions for the Male white New Zealand rabbits 2 to 2.5 kg were immunized intradermally, twice at two week intervals, with 1 mℓ of 20 mg mℓ bovine serum albumin BSA Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN emulsified in complete Freunds adjuvant. On the third week, the rabbits received a single intra articular injection of 10 mg BSA in 1.0 mℓ of saline into the right knee joint to initiate joint arthritis. Left knee joints served as controls. The diameter of the joints was measured using a Fowler dial caliper, sensitive to 0.01 mm. The BSA injected joints swell and typically measure 3 to 4 mm larger than control joints. On the fourth week, the rabbits received another intra articular injection of BSA in saline to initiate joint inflammation. CHS MLVs were prepared as described in Section 8.1. using 270.0 mg CHS and 10 mg indomethacin, resulting in final concentration of 1.0 mg mℓ indomethacin. Three days following induction of the inflammation, BSA injected animals received a single intramuscular injection of the 1 mg mℓ indomethacin entrapped in CHS vesicles total dose 1 mg animal . Joint swelling was measured for another ten days. Results illustrated graphically in FIG. 5, indicate that the indomethacin entrapped in CHS MLVs was effective in reducing joint swelling when administered intramuscularly. Mice were inoculated intravenously or intramuscularly with 500 µg kg body weight of diazepam entrapped in CHS SUVs prepared as described in Section 8.2. The diazepam had a sedative effect on the mice the mice fell asleep after inoculation indicating the retention of activity of the entrapped drug. CHS SUVs containing entrapped diazepam were prepared as described in Section 8.2. After sonication in a bath sonicator, the absorbance of the suspension measured at a wavelength of 550 nm was 0.370. Then a 44.2 µℓ aliquot of the CHS SUV suspension was added into a glass test tube, onto which 1.48x10⁴Bq 40 µCi of ¹⁴C diazepam specific activity is equal to 6.7x10⁶Bq mg 181 µCi mg supplied as 3.7x10⁶Bq mℓ 100 µCi mℓ in ethanol had been dried down under nitrogen. After mixing vortically for five minutes, 1.282 mℓ of 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.3 , 0.14 M NaCl buffer was added to the solution resulting in a thirty fold dilution of the suspension, yielding a therapeutic dose for the mice of 0.167 mg mℓ diazepam. A 0.1 mℓ aliquot of the CHS SUV ¹⁴C diazepam suspension was injected into the tail vein of conscious, restrained 35 mg Swiss Webster mice. Control mice were similarly inoculated with an equivalent does of unentrapped ¹⁴C diazepam. At 1, 2, or 5 hours post injection, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the internal organs kidney, lung, spleen, liver, gut, brain, heart, pancreas, and fat and a blood sample were removed. The organs were weighed and a small sample 20 40 µg of each was digested and decolorized according to the method of Mahim and Kohberg 1966, Analytical Biochem. The results of this experiment are shown in FIG.6. In the mice inoculated with the CHS SUV entrapped diazepam, the drug does not accumulate in the spleen, indicating that the diazepam entrapped in CHS SUVs does not behave like phospholipid liposome entrapped drug when administered intravenously In order to determine whether CHS vesicles remain intact when administered At the end of 1, 2, 5, and 24 hours 3 mice from each group treated with a liposome preparation and 4 mice from the group treated with unencapsulated ⁵¹Chromium were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The organs were removed, rinsed with 0.9 saline, weighed and counted as previously described to determine the dose and dose gram remaining in each organ tested. The results, shown in FIG. 7 demonstrate that unencapsulated chromium see FIG. 7C is excreted rapidly, and does not concentrate in any of the organs tested. EPC and CHS encapsulated chromium remains at measurable levels 24 hours after injection, indicating that CHS vesicles, like EPC SPLVs, remain intact in vivo. Moreover, EPC SPLVs 13 mg mℓ which have a mean diameter between 0.5 and 1.0 microns, accumulate in the liver, lung, and spleen see FIG. 7B CHS multilamellar vesicles incorporating ¹²⁵I human growth hormone HGH, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA were prepared as follows tris salt CHS was added to 0.01 M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 3.7x10⁴Bq mℓ 1 µCi mℓ ¹²⁵I HGH New England Nuclear, Boston, MA to yield a final concentration 25 mg mℓ tris salt CHS. The suspension was mixed vortically with glass beads. The resulting CHS MLVs entrapped 10 of the ¹²⁵I HGH as determined by a comparison of the initial radioactive counts. A group of 12 female Swiss Webster mice were injected intramuscularly in the hind limb with 0.5 mℓ of the CHS MLV entrapped ¹²⁵I HGH suspension. A control group of 12 mice were injected with 0.5 mℓ free ¹²⁵I HGH in .01 M Tris HCl, 0.14 M NaCl buffer. Each animal in both groups received approximately 35,000 cpm animal. At periodic intervals post injection, the mice were sacrificed, the hind limb dissected, and percent total radioactivity remaining was determined. The data in Table V demonstrate substantial increase in retention of ¹²⁵I HGH when incorporated into CHS MLVs. Thus, when injected intramuscularly, the CHS liposome entrapped drug is released in a sustained fashion.
