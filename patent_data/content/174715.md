## Description
ATTITUDE ANGLE CALCULATION APPARATUS FOR A GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE This invention relates to an attitude angle calculation apparatus for use in precisely controlling the attitude of a geostationary satellite, more particularly an earth directed satellite the attitude of which is controlled with respect to the earth in three orthogonal axes. For an earth surveillance satellite or a communications satellite, in order to maintain a predetermined orientation of an antenna or measuring device with respect to the earth, it is necessary to align a specified axis of the satellite with a straight line connecting the satellite and the earth. An attitude angle calculation apparatus is used to calculate the angular relationship of a c rdinate system of the satellite with respect to a line connecting the satellite and the earth and a line orthogonal to a plane including the orbit of the satellite. An attitude control device controls the attitude angle of the satellite so that the result of the calculation performed by the attitude angle calculation apparatus becomes zero, to thereby maintain a predetermined axis of the satellite directed towards an object. Referring to Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings, typically a conventional attitude angle calculation apparatus operates to detect relative deviation angles and e of the Zn axis of the satellite, which ts to be directed to the earth A, from the orbital coordinate system XO, VO,ZO measured by an earth sensor mounted on the satellite.In detail, the roll angle , which is the angle of rotation of the ZB axis of the satellite about its XB axis from the ZO axis of the orbital coordinate system, is detected by the earth sensor on the basis of the difference of a scanning width defined by fields of sight B1 and B2 of the earth sensor, and the pitch angle 6, which is the angle of rotation of the ZB axis of the satellite about its YB axis, on the basis of the amount of deviation of a reference pulse having a transmitting direction c, measured from the centre of the scanning pulse. However, in such a conventional attitude angle calculation apparatus, it is impossible to measure the yaw angle , which is the angle of rotation of the satellite about its axis ZB. In order to overcome this problem, it has been proposed to measure the yaw angle by using a fixed star sensor mounted on the satellite. Fig. 2 shows the concept of such a proposal in which the star Polaris 2 a UraeMonalis is detected by the fixed star senspr directed along the Yg axis of the satellite such that a center of the field of sight 1 of the fixed star sensor is directed to Polaris 2.Assuming coordinates Z,X of Polar.is 2 in the field of sight 1 of the fixed star sensor, the yaw angle can be calculated as follows provided that the satellite is in a stationary orbit with the roll deviation and the pitch deviation always being zero and the tilt of the orbit also being zero t X Epsin i alpha 0, , 27 , .... 1 where Ep is the declination of Polaris 2 and a is the difference between the right ascension of Pplaris 2 and the right ascension of the satellite.Since, however, it is difficult for a practical satellite to maintain the angles a and and the tilting of the orbit at zero, the noneero angles e and 6 and the orbital conditions of the satellite affect the measured value Z,X of the fixed star, and it is impossible to separate them from each other. Therefore, it is impossible to measure the yaw angle precisely. In another approach, a sun sensor is used as the fixed star sensor. The sun sensor is mounted on the satellite with the field of sight thereof being in coincidence with the Xg axis of the satellite. In this case, the variation of the angle of incidence q of the sun is detected. Fig. 3 shows the concept of the latter. InFig. 3, reference characters I, O, N, L, M, ss and L depict the orbital plane, the center of the earth A, a direction normal to the orbital plane, a cross line of a plane including a vector S in the direction of the sun and a line ON and the orbital plane 1, a point in the orbital plane 1 separated from the line L by 90, an angle between a line OM and a line from the center 0 to a point P on the orbit, and a line parallel to the line L in a XO,ZO plane, respectively. As is clear from Fig. 3, when ss 0, i.e., the sun is always in the Xo,Yo plane, and assuming that the angle of incidence TI is 0 at a certain time instant, the deviation n thereof after the time instant coincides with a deviation 4t of the yaw angle. That is, the roll angle is completely separated from the deviation .However, for a practical satellite, since the sun is out of the X0,Yo plane due to the orbital movement of the satellite, the variation bd of the roll angle about the XO axis of the satellite affects h n unseparably, causing precise measurement of yaw angle deviation n to be impossible although there is no interference between the pitch angle e and n . An object of the present invention is to provide an altitude angle calculation apparatus by which the yaw angle can be obtained with high precisicn. According to the invention there is provided attitude angle calculation apparatus to be mounted on a satellite for calculating an attitude angle of the satellite, characterised by an earth sensor for detecting deviation of an angle defined between a predetermined axis of the satellite and a straight line connecting the satellite and the geocentre of the earth a fixed star sensor for detecting a physical intermatrix of a fixed star and yaw angle determination means responsive to orbital position information of the satellite sent from a ground station and to outputs of the earth sensor and the fixed star sensor to determine the yaw angle of the satellite independently of roll angle and or pitch angle thereof. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates the above described concept of measurement of the roll angle and the pitch angle by an earth sensor Fig. 2 depicts the above described concept of yaw angle measurement by a fixed star sensor Fig. 3 shows a positional relation between the sun and a satellite and illustrates the above described concept of interference between yaw angle deviation and the roll angle Fig. 4 is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 5 depicts a mathematical model showing the relationship between inertial space coordinates and orbital coordinates Fig. 6 is a schematic block diagram of another embodiment oi the present invention Fig. 7 is a similar model to that shown in Fig. 5 for use in explaining the embodiment of Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a mathematical model showing the relationship between geocentric inertial coordinates and the position of the sun and Fig. 9 is a schematic block diagram of a further embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 4 of the drawings, a first embodiment of an attitude angle calculation apparatus of the present invention includes an earth sensor 3, a fixed star sensor 5, and an attitude angle calculation unit 8 comprising an orbit coordinate calculation unit 4, a fixed star vector calculation unit 6, a yaw angle calculation unit 7, and a command signal ON OFF switch S. The orbit coordinate calculation unit 4 calculates orbital coordinates of the satellite at an arbitrary time instant using orbital information D transmitted from a ground station as a command signal. The fixed star vector calculation unit 6 receives data from the fixed star sensor 5 and calculates therefrom a unit vector in the direction to a fixed star with respect to the coordinates of the axis of the satellite. The yaw angle calculation unit 7 receives the orbital coordinates calculated by the orbit coordinate calculation unit 4, the unit vector of the fixed star under observation as calculated by the fixed star vector calculation unit 6, and data t , t from the earth sensor 3 and calculates the yaw angle t of the coordinates of the satellite axis with respect to the orbital coordinates. Fig. 5 depicts a mathematical model showing the relation of the orbital coordinates Xo,Yo,Zo to the inertial space coordinates XI,YI,ZI . It is assumed that the ascending node right ascension, the orbital tilting, the period, and the ascending node separation angle at a time instant to are given as the orbital information D from the ground command by n, i, J and for respectively. In this case, the orbital coordinates are given by the following equation EMI8.1 tb SEP X SEP SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP sin SEP SEP cos SEP f SEP sin SEP i tb SEP cos SEP i SEP sin SEP cos SEP SEP f SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP cos SEP SEP f tb SEP YO SEP SEP sin SEP i SEP sin SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP cos SEP i SEP YI tb SEP ZO SEP SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP cos SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP sin SEP SEP sin SEP i SEP SEP SEP ZI tb SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP cos SEP f SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP cos SEP SEP f tb OCI XI, YI, ZI T T transposition 2 f fo 2 t to T 3 The orbital coordinate calculation unit 4 performs its operation according to equations 2 and 3 to derive the orbital coordinates. Describing the operation of the fixed star vector calculation unit 6, the fixed star sensor 4 is mounted on the satellite with its optical axis YS being in coincidence with the YB axis of the satellite, as shown in Fig. 2. A fixed star detection level of the sensor 4 is set at a stellar magnitude of a star which is higher than third stellar magnitude, and the field of sight of the sensor 4 is selected as on the order of 40 x 40. With these conditions, the sensor 4 mounted on a stationary satellite directed to the earth A can detect only Polaris 2.Assuming that the coordinates of the fixed star observed by the fixed star sensor 4 are Z,X , the unit vector S f in the direction to Polaris 2 with respect to XB, Yg and ZB of the satellite is given by the following equation EMI9.1 tb S1 SEP cos SEP Z SEP sin SEP X tb SEP S f SEP SEP SEP S2 SEP SEP BCs SEP cos SEP Z SEP cos SEP X SEP , SEP SEP ... SEP 4 tb SEP S3 SEP sin SEP Z tb where BCs is a coordinate transformation matrix determined by the relation between the fixed star sensor coordinates system and the coordinate axis of the satellite, which matrix can be obtained preliminarily. The yaw angle calculation unit 7 receives OCI obtained from equation 2, the fixed star direction unit vector obtained by the equation 4, and the roll angle t and the pitch angle e t measured by the earth sensor 3 and calculates the yaw angle according to the following equation sin S2bl a3bl S3b2 a2B3 albl a2b2 , ... 5 where EMI10.1 EMI10.2 tb 1c SEP cos SEP SEP RAS SEP cos SEP DIS tb 2c SEP SEP SEP SEP OCI SEP sin SEP RAS SEP cos SEP DIS SEP , SEP ...

According to this embodiment, the yaw angle can be obtained by performing operations to obtain c1, c2, c3 by inserting the output OCI of the orbital coordinates calculation unit 4 into equation 7, obtaining ai and bi i l, 2, 3 by inserting the value ofEMI11.1 thus obtained and the values ,e obtained by the earth sensor 3 into equation 6, and calculating the desired yaw angle by inserting ai and bi thus obtained and the components S2,S3 of the unit vector S f calculated in the fixed star vector calculation portion 6 into equation 5 . According to this embodiment, the yaw angle of the satellite can be obtained precisely by using the data from the fixed star sensor 4, regardless of whether or not the output , j of the attitude angle calculator 8 is nearly equal to zero or whether or not the orbital tilting of the satellite is nearly equal to zero. Fig. 6 shows another embodiment of the present invention in which the sun is used as the fixed star and a sun ephemeris calculator 9 is added to the attitude calculator 8. Other components are the same as or similar to those used in the embodiment shown in Fig. 4 and are thus depicted by the same reference numerals as those used in Fig. 4. With this arrangement, an orbital coordinates calculator 4 calculates the orbital coordinates of the satellite at an arbitrary time instant as described with reference to Fig. 4. A fixed star vector calculator 6, a sun vector calculator in this case, receives data from a fixed star sensor, in this case a sun sensor 11, and calculates a unit vector in the direction toward the sun with respect to the coordinate axes of the satellite. A sun ephemeris calculator 9 operates to calculate the declination and right ascension of the sun in the direction to the sun with respect to geocentric inertial coordinates at the time instant at which the sun sensor 4 detects the sun.A yaw angle calculator 7 receives the unit vector in the direction to the sun given by the orbital coordinate calculator 4, the declination and right ascension of the sun given by the sun ephemeris calculator 9, and the data given by the earth sensor 3 to calculate the yaw angle of the satellite with respect to the orbital coordinates system. Fig. 7 depicts a mathematical model giving the relation of the orbital coordinate system Xo,Yo,Zo to the geocentric inertial coordinate system XI,YI,zI . The right ascension at the ascending node, the orbital tilting i, the period T and the ascending node deviation angle f0, all at the time instant t0, are here assumed as being given by the orbital information contained in the ground command.The orbital coordinates at this time are given by EMI13.1 tb Xn SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP sin SEP n SEP cos SEP f SEP sin SEP i SEP i SEP XT SEP tb SEP SEP cos SEP SEP i SEP sin SEP SEP cos SEP f SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP cos SEP f SEP SEP tb YO SEP SEP SEP SEP sin SEP SEP i SEP sin SEP SEP SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP SEP cos SEP i SEP SEP SEP SEP YI tb ZO SEP sin SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP cos SEP f SEP cos SEP SEP sin SEP SEP sin SEP i SEP ZI tb SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP SEP cos SEP f SEP cos SEP i SEP cos SEP SEP f tb OCI XI, YI, ZI T ..... 8 where T indicates transposition. f S f0 2X t to T . ... 9 The above operations are performed by. the orbital coordinates calculator 4. Tne operations performed by the sun vector calculator 6 will now be described with the assumption that a two axis sun sensor of a commonly used type is available on the satellite. The two axis sun sensor measures an azimuth angle g and an ascending vertical angle b of the sun with respect to the coordinate system of the sun sensor on the satellite, as is well known.Therefore, the unit vector S t in the direction to the sun with respect to the satellite axis coordinates system is as given below EMI14.1 tb SEP S1 SEP cos SEP g SEP cos SEP b tb S t SEP SEP S2 SEP SEP BCS SEP SEP sin SEP g SEP cos SEP b SEP , SEP ...

The sun vector calculator 6 performs the above operation to determine the unit vector S t . The operation of the sun ephemeris calculator 9 will now be described with reference to Fig. 8, which illustrates a mathematical model showing the relation between the sun and the geocentric inertial coordinate system. In Fig. 8, the right ascension R t and the declination D A of the sun are given as follows sin D t sina sin t ... 11 cos R A cos t cos D t ... 12 where alpha 0.409 rad . t 0.0172 x D, where D is the number of days counted from the equinox time of the year in which the satellite is launched to the current time. The yaw angle calculator 7 receives the unit vector obtained according to equation 10, the right ascension and declination of the sun obtained from equations 11 and 12, and the roll angle t and the pitch angle e t measured by the earth sensor 3 to calculate the yaw angle according to the following equations sin 4 S2b, a3bl S3b2 a2b3 albl a2b2 13 where EMI16.1 EMI16.2 tb SEP Ab3 SEP SEP rc SEP cos SEP 0 t SEP cos SEP H t tb Ioc 3 SEP 3 tb SEP cos SEP R t SEP cos SEP D t tb SEP , c SEP SEP 0CI SEP sin SEP R t SEP cos tb SEP D t SEP ...

Fig. 9 shows another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 9, a register 10 stores positional information sso of the satellite which is contained in the command signal transmitted from the ground station, and an initial correction calculator 12 receives the positional information 8o stored in the register 10 and data from the earth sensor 4 to obtain an initial value of a correction to be added to the data from the sun sensor 4. That is, the initial correction calculator 12 reads out the content Bg of the register 10, which gives the angular relation of the position of the satellite in a plane 1 Fig. 3 with respect to the sun at the time to and the roll angle 0 measured by the earth sensor 3 at the same time t0 and operates to obtain the initial correction a0 according to the following equation aO O sin ssO. ... 16 A correction amount calculator 16 receives the data from the earth sensor 3, the initial correction aO from the initial correction calculator 12, and the angular relation between the satellite and the sun given by the orbital position calculator 4, and from them calculates the amount of correction to be added sequentially to the data from the sun sensor 4.
