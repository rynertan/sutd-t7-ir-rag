## Description
A colouring composition for plasticsThe invention relates to a method of manufacturing a plastics product by an extrusion or injection moulding process, starting from a plasticscompound comprising a thermoplastics material, a dyestuff and at least one additive preventing a degradation of plastics.An additive preventing degradation of plastics material is understood to be an additive which prevents a decrease in mechanical strength of a plas tics object, particularly if same is exposed to the open air and sunlight, for instance, a Wstabilizer, anti oxidizing agents or such.Such a method is known in the art. It is customary in said known method of manufacturing a plasticsproduct such as, for instance, sections by extrusion or crates by injectionmoulding, to start with a granulate in which the additives preventing a degradation of plastics material have already been admixed. The additives may consist of UV stabilizers, anti oxidizing agents or sucSSaidinitial granulate is then dyed with dyestuff in known dispensing and mixing apparatus and subsequently processed by extrusion oraninjection moulding process. A method of this type offers the disadvantage that it is bounded to specific amounts and kinds of additives such as occur in granulates. Apart from the fact that these granulates are more expensive than so called unmixed granulates, said disadvantageis particularly clear if, for specific applications, special additives preventing degradation of plastics would be selected at choice. In the latter case either very large quantities of granulates would have to be purchased or a higher oostprice should be paid, causing the price of the product to be too expensive.It is the object of the invention to provide a method which does not offer these disadvantages and according to which there is no need to start from a plasticsmaterial or plastics compound to which very specific amounts of additives resisting decomposition of plastics material have been admixed.This aim is attained in that a lasticsmateriol or plastics composition is mixed with a preformed mixture of dye stuff and at least one additive preventing a degradation of plastics.This method is a most surprising fact because an expert in the art would assume the flow of dyestuff to be strongly affected by the presence of said additives, so that mixing the latter with the granulate would leave much to be desired and colour differences in the finished products could be expected. This is, however, not the case.Another notable advantage of the present method is thot very small amounts of said additives can be received in the plastics or plasticscompound. So far, this was only possible when mixing additives with natural granulate, with amounts of 0,01 to 0,5 by weight, which requires a very expensive equipment for dispensing and mixing. Moreover, separate dispensers and mixers for colouring where required which, in normal circumstances dispense only accurately at 0,5 by weight of additives and more.So, when the method according to the invention is carried out, extremely small amounts of additives need be added.Only one simple apparatus for dispensing and mixing is then used, which apparatus simultaneously supplies a mixture of dyestuff and additive preventing a degradation of plastics.An apparatus which dispenses only accurately at 0,5 by weight and more, need therefore not be used.It is observed that a preformed mixture of dyestuff and one or more of said additives cannot be separated and may be added as c component. Additives preventing a degradation of plastics, mostly in the form of anti oxidizing agents and UVabsorbing agents, adhere more or less to the duestuff.A mixing with a plastics compound is preferably carried out at room temperature, whereafter an object is produced by injectionmoulding or extrusion.The dyestuff preferably comprises 15 to 5 by weight of additives. An amount of the mixture is added to the compound, such that same comprises 0,5 t 1 by weight of dyestuff.Both organic and inorganic dyestuffs can be used, such as anthrachinone, phtalocyanic and indantrhen dyestuffs as organic dyestuffs as well as cadmium yellow, cadmium selenium sulfite, nickel titanium pigments, chromium oxides, cobalt pigments, ultramarine, iron oxide, titanium oxide and carbon black.Suitable additives preventing a degradation of plastics are anti oxidizing agents,UV stabilizers, and the like, which can be applied both individually and jointly.Examples of anti oxidizing agents are cresols, phenols, organic phosphites and propionates benzophenones and benzotriazoles are axamples of UV stabilizers.The method according to the invention can advantageously be carried out in order to form products of polyolefins obtained from recycled polyolefins from polyolefin products, for instance, polyolefin products such as polyethylene crates.After an average lifespan of seven years, the mechanical properties of said crates become insufficient. New crates injection moulded from scrap material of old ones having an age of over seven years will meet all desired requirements, but will have a considerably shorter lifespan. This in comparison with the lifespan of crates obtained from natural granulate. The mechanical properties of said new old crates leave very much to be desired after a short lapse of time.The use of a preformed mixture of dyestuff and one or more additives, has proved to be effective for application of recycled polyolefins from old plastics crates. The plastics products formed will have all of the properties of crates made of a natural granulate. The invention in another aspect relates to a method of preparing a plastic composition while applying thermoplastics plastics, a dyestuff and at least one additive preventing degradation of plastics wherein plastics or a plastiascomposition are oris mixed with a preformed mixture of dyestuff and at least one additive preventing a degradation of plastics.The invention also relates to a method of preparing a colouring compound for plasticizing plastics wherein a dyestuff is mixed with at least one additive preventing a degradation of plastics.The invention will now be explained by means of some examples.EXAMPLE I 600 g of cobalt pigment are mixed with 120,3 g of 2,2 methylene bis 4 ethyl 6.tert,butylphenol as an anti oxidizing agent, at room temperature in a known dyestuff mixer. After one hour of mixing the anti oxidizing agent is mixed completely with the initial dyestuff this can be perceived visually. The flowing properties of the bosic dye stuff with 16,7 by weight of additive have hardly changed. In a dispensing mixer 500 g of this dyestuff additive compound is mixed with 49,5 kg of natural polyethylene granulate melting index 6,5 g 10 minutes, specific weight 0,963 g ml , where after crates are being injection mouldeM the tensile strength measured on normalized bars , obtained from crateshs proved to 2 2 amount 197 kg cm with a standard deviation of 44 kg cm . When crates are injection moulded from natural polyethylene granulate, a tensile strength of 212 kg cm2 with a standard deviotion of 50 kg cm is produced. A comparison between the said two standard deviations shows that dispersion of pigment treated in the polyethylene does not cause a dispersion of tensile strength in the walls of the crate to be effected. EXAMPLE II In a dye stuff mixer 1.560 g of chromiumtrioxide dyestuff is mixed with 840 g of 2 hydroxy 4n octoxybenzophenon. W stabilizer for polyolefins producing after two hours a pig ment compound complying with requirements concerning flow velocity and colour. 2.310 g of this dyestuff is subsequently mixed with 47,7 kg of natural polyethylene granulate melting index 7,5 9 10 minutes specific weight 0,965 g ml. in a COLORTRONIC dispensing and mixing apparatus connected to an injection moulding machine.Test bars of crates obtained by injection moulding show a tensile strength of 204 kg cmê with a standard deviation of 45 kg cm2 those of crates of the same natural granulate have a tensile strength of 231 kgtcm2 2 with a standard deviation of 52 kg cm in each of the tests the number of test bars amounted to 10 . EXAMPLE III Cadmium yellow pigment CdS was mixed with the following additives preventing degradation of plastics, in the manner of examples I and II 25 by weight of 2,2Ú methylene bis 4 ethyl 6 tert.butyl phenol anti oxidizing agent a 25 by weight of cyclic neopentanetetrayl bis octadecyl phosphite distearyl pentacryl thritodiphosphite anti oxidizing agent b 25 by weight of 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzo phenon UV stabilizer c and 12,5 by weight of anti oxidizing agent b with 12 by weight of W stsbilizer c.Said pigment compositions were mixed with polyethylene recycled from crates in the manner of example II and crates were formed thereof by injection moulding. From the some recycled material melting index 6,5 g 10 minutes, specific weight 0,964 g ml to which only 0,6 by weight of cadmium yellow pigment as yellow pigment was added blank ofRef. 2 .16 test bars were cut from crates of each botch in order to test the tensile strength from blank Ref. 2 crates respectively 32 test bors were taken. Each time 16 test bars were subsequently exposed to 800 hours of artificial sunlight, such as is obtained in a known Xenon test apparatus 1600 hours of actual testing .The results of the tensile strength test with both exposed and unexposed test bars will be shown in the following table I 2Table I Tensile strength in kg cm of test bars from crates obtained by injection moulding recycled material, without Ref. 2 and with code 2 to 6 artificial ageing.o X average value of 16 test bars S standard deviationEMI7.1 tb Code SEP Ref.
