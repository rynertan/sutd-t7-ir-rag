# Trigger operated tool handle switch.

## Abstract
An electrical switch having spaced stationary contacts 40, 41 and a contact carrier C carrying a bridging con tact 44 in linear reciprocation relative to the stationary contacts, with the bridging contact biased toward the sta tionary contacts. The bridging contact is linearly movable by the contact carrier and is rotatably hinged to the contact carrier and a projection 60 is disposed between the sta tionary contacts for engagement with the leading contact end 46 for pivoting and lifting the leading contact end from its stationary contact in coaction with the hinged con nection with a quick break action during movement of the contact carrier to the non bridging position. Each conductor wire 70 connected to the switch is releasably secured therein by a spring like retainer blade 72 biased diagonally against the wire. Each retainer blade has a release arm 78 for deactivating the retainer blade thus permitting easy withdrawal of the conductor wire.
