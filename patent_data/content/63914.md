# Glass fibre strand winding apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for winding a strand of glass fibers drawn from a bushing 1 , having a rotatable turret 7 and at least two winding collets 8, 8 mounted on the turret 7 and adapted to be brought into an winding position one by one upon rotation of the turret. Each winding collet 8, 8 is provided at its free end with a waste strand 9 winding portion having a frusto conical strand guide surface 11, 12 coaxially extending with the collet and converged towards its free end, an annular strand stop ping wall radially outwardly extending from the free end of the frusto conical guide surface, at least one crescent shaped wall surface 16 extending radially inwardly from a portion of the outer periphery at the free end of the guide surface and formed thereon with a plurality of parallel grooves 17 extending at a right angle to the diameter of the guide surface, and a cres cent shaped flat portion extending from a portion of the outer periphery of the stopping wall in confronting spaced relation ship with the crescent shaped wall surface. Upon the transfer ring of the strand from the full collet to the empty collet, when the strand is brought onto the frusto conical guide surface, it is moved along the guide surface toward its free end, then slipped down along the crescent shaped flat portion and finally caught by one of parallel grooves. The strand thus caught is automatically cut at a point in contact with the edge of the groove during subsequent rotation of both of the full and the empty collets.
