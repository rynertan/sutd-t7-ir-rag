# Digital to analog converter.

## Abstract
The currents I₃, I₄, I₅ of first current source transistors T₃, T₄, T₅ constitute a binary weighted series of currents, which currents are each in a given ratio to a current I₁ which is applied to a reference transistor T₁ . The currents I₃, I₄, I₅ from the first current source transistors T₃, T₄, T₅ are switched to the analog output 15 or to the positive power supply terminal 20 by means of first switching devices 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 . The converter further comprises a control device 30 , which comprises a second current source transistor T₈ , which is connected to a reference current source 2 or to the positive power supply terminal 20 by means of a second switching device 4 . The current I₈ from the second current source transistor T₈ has a given ratio to the current I₁ in the reference transistor T₁ . If the second current source transistor T₈ is connected to the positive power supply terminal 20 , the reference transistor T₁ will carry the full reference current I
