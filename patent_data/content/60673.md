## Description
EXTRUDABLE FILM FORMING COMPOSITIONS OF ZIEGLER NATTACATALYZED OLEFIN POLYMERS INCLUDING ANTI GEL AND ANTI BLOCKCOMPONENTS This invention relates to anti gel and anti block componants useful for reducing optical degradation phenomena and discoloration in extruded film. Olefin polymers such as polyethylene have been used for a number of years for the preparation of films by extrusion processes. Unlike high pressure, free radical polymerized polyethylenes, lov pressure, low density poly ethylene a prepared in the presence of Ziegler Natta catalysts frequently develop gel like defect when extruded, e.g., when extruded as blown films. In a blown film process, polyethylene pellets or granules are melted and extruded from an annular die to form a film envelope. In the extruder and die system, there are typically dead spots or hangup areas where molten polyethylene does not love rapidly, resulting in long heat histories for portions of the melt.As portion of the polymer are flushed from these hangup areas, they cause optical degradation phenomena in the film, known as pinatriping and gel streaking . By pinstriping is meant haze bands resulting from accumulations of micro gels which are aligned in the machine direction during the film forming process. By gel streaking is meant surface roughness in the form of the inclusion, either singularly or in rovs, of v shaped gels arrowheads or chevrons . streaks of soft gels, or, in extreme cases, film texture completely permeated by soft gels. Such optical degradation phenomena. not only detract from film optical and mechanical strength properties, but also can cause severe problems vith respect to maintaining bubble geoMetry during the film forming process. Because of the fact that the extrusion processes usually involve the use of relatively high extrusion temperatures and prolonged extrusion times, in commercial practice, various anti oxidants. such as hindered phenollcs, are admixed with the olefin polymer, to prevent undesirable degradation of the polymer during the preparation of the film. When such anti oxidants are used, however, with the film forming grades of olefin polymers in certain types of extrusion equipment, the anti oxidants appear to pronounce, if not create gel streaking and pinstriping in the products thus formed. Blocking of olefin polymer films is a well known pheno mena By.blocking is meant the tendency of films or sheets to stick or adhere to each other or to other surfaces whenever adhe sion is undesirable. Various anti block agents are commonly incorporated into film forming polymers or applied to film surfaces to reduce blocking. For example, stearamide, stearoguan 1 amine, metal salts of fatty acids such as calcium stearate sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate finely divided silica or calcium carbonate alkylamines and alkyl quaternary ammonium conpounds 1 are anti block agents which have been incorporated into the film forming polymer before extrusion. Many solutions have been proposed to eliminate gel streaking and pinstriping. Por example, it is known to physically remove the chloride catalyst residue, prior to axersion, 5 leaching the reaction product of polymer and chloride catalyst residue with alcohols1 aqueous acid, water, or treating the polymer and catalyst with propylene oxide followed by an alcohol or witter wash and the like.Such treatments usually produce white polymers initially, but a yellow or tan colon returns when the polymers are subjected to molding andlor heating operations. In order to avoid this undesirable color formation, it is usually necessary to use a second or even a third clo n up procedure requiring the use of large quantities of deactivating materialsAnother practice in the art involves drying the after treated polymer prior to fabrication.Because they usually must be repeated several times in order to obtain a polymer having acceptable color upon exposure to heat, such cleanup procedures are both expensive and time consuming Illustrative of such prior art treatments are those disclosed. in U.S. patents 3,925,i41 3,962,199 3,247,351 4,029,877 4,117,219 3,299,027 3,923,760 3,308,105 and 4,d98,990. Other treatments disclosed in the prior art involve the addition of compounds to the polymer prior to fabrication in order to complex with the harmful components in the chloride catalyst residue and deactivate them. Illustrative of these prior art treatments are those disclosed in Canadian patent 961,998,U.S. patent 4,013,622 and in U.S. patent 3,773,743 U.S. patent 3,773,743 discloses a method for improving the stability and color of olefin polymers by deactivating their Ziegler Natta chloride catalyst residues.This method involves high temperature 190iC 2504C processing with hydroxyl compounds R20 and primary alcohols and with an organic base such as an alkyl amine aryl amine Li, Ca and Zn salts of carboxylic acids trialkyl phosphites and metal alkoxides. The concentration disclosed for the hydroxy source is the range of 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent and a concentration of 50 to 2500 parts per million ppm is disclosed for the organic base.At the processing temperatures disclosed, some of the organic bases and the hydroxy sources would be volatile and cause forming of the product if the processing were not done in a way to remove volatiles, e.g., as in devol tilizing extruders Canadian patent 961,998 and U.S. patent 4,013,622 disclose the addition of polyalkylene glycol having a molecular weight between 100 and 20,000 to film grade olefin polymers to prevent gel streaking during film extrusion processes.In commercial practice, however, it has been found that extruded film made according to Canadian patent 961,998 subsequently discolors in a few weeks even at ambient temperatures i.e., it turns a yellowish color which is, of course, undesirable. The primary cause for discoloration in extruded films or molded articles is generally recognized as related to the presence of hindered phenolic anti oxidants. Discoloration generally is believed to result from the reaction or breakdown products of such anti oxidants. Exposure of these anti oxidant stabilized compositions to air pollution in the form of oxides of nitrogen can promote discoloration. Thermal abuse in processing, especially in the presence of prodegradants, can lead to the build up of chromophoric quinoid structures from break down of the hindered phenolic anti oxidants. Prodegradants can be additives used to control surface slip or release properties, anti static. properties, and gel streaking tendencies. For example prodegradants act to provide hydroperoxides to accelerate auto oxidation. Polyethylene glycols used to control gel streaking and unsaturated fatty amides used for slip control can act with thermal abuse as prodegradants. Trace metals from inorganic snti blocks or fillers can act as reduction oxidation catalysts to accelerate hydroperoxide decomposition. especially at low temperatures where the peroxide decomposition is the rate limiting step. At uch low temperature, normally volatile, anti oxidant reaction or break down products can accumulate, promoting discoloration. Moreover. inorganic additives or fillers such as finely divided silica with iron conta ination can interact with the hindered phenolic anti oxidant to form chronophoric, phenolate species.The The present invention seeks to provide an extrudable, film forming composition comprising a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer and an extruded film made from such extrudable composition, which film is free from gel streaking and pinstriping. The present invention also seeks to provide a process wherein a film forming composition containing a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer may be extruded without optical degradation phenomenon appearing within the extruded film or film discoloration occurring subsequently. The present invention further seeks to provide an anti gel and an inorganic anti block compound which, when added to a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer, is useful in removing or reacting with the chloride catalyst residue in the olefin polymer to prevent gel streaking or pinstriping from occurring in a subsequent extrusion process, as well as preventing discoloration from occurring upon aging of the extruded film. The present invention additionally seeks to provide an improved process for extruding tubular olefin polymer film. The present invention still further seeks to provide masterbatch concentrate which can be admixed with a Ziegler Natta composition of this invention. This invention is based on the discovery that an optical degradation phenomenon, known as gel streaking and pinstriping, present in extruded Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer, can be substantially prevented through the addition of small amounts of an anti gel compound of low volatility. In addition, when extrusion is also carried out in the presence of an inorganic anti block compound having a substantially neutral pE, i.e., between about 6 and about 8, film sticking or tackiness is prevented without leading to discoloration of the film upon raging. The anti gel compound is characterized by having a chain of at least about 5 repeat units of an alkylene oxide and by having a molecular weight between 200 and 4,000,000 Daltons. According to the present invention, the incidence of gel streaking or pinstriping in the film during the extrusion of a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer and discoloration of the extruded film upon aging are both minimized through the use of a composition comprising a majority of a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer and a minor amount of at least one hindered phenolic anti oxidant, an inorganic anti block compound and an anti gel compound as defined herein.This invention also relates to an improved method of extruding a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer which comprises extruding a film forming composition containing a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer and minor amounts of at least one hindered phenolic anti oxidant, an inorgamicanti block compound and an anti gel compound as defined herein. Mor over, this invention relates to a masterbatch concentrate which may be admixed with a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer to yield the film forming composition of this invention.In one aspect, the present invention relates to an extrudable film forming composition which, when extruded, forms film essentially devoid of gel streaking and pinstriping and which does not discolor upon aging at 60 C for 4 weeks. The film forming composition is comprised of at least one olefin polymer containing a chloride catalyst residue, at least one hindered phenolic anti oxidant, an inorganic antiblock compound having a substantially neutral pE, and an anti gel compound characterized by having at least about 5 repeat units of an alkylene oxide. The anti gel compound is present in a concentration sufficient to neutralize the chloride catalyst residue in the composition.The concentra tion of anti gel compound is at least about 0.8 times the concen tration of the anti oxidant. The residues of Ziegler Natta catalysts include trace amounts of magnesium, titanium, aluminum and chlorine. By chloride residues, as used herein, is meant the chlorides of magnesium, titanium and aluminum present in a Ziegler Natta catalyst residue. Chloride catalyst residue concentrations between about 5 and about 50 ppm are typical for ethylene polymers and chloride catalyst residue concentrations between about 10 and about 500 ppm are typical for propylene polymers and butene polymer made with Zlegltr Natta catalysts. Anti oxidants in a concentration of 20 to 500 ppm are typically added to ethylene polymer compositions. According to the present invention, the anti gel compound is present in a concentration of 25 to 10,000 ppm for polyethylene resin composi tions. And concentrations of 200 to 5000 ppm of anti oxidant are typically added to propylene polymer or butenc polymer composi tions. Concentrations of anti gel compound of 200 to 10,000 are added to propylene polymer or butene polymer composition. Inorganic anti block compounds in a concentration of 500 to 5 by weight are typically added to olefin polymer compositions. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for extruding a film forming olefin polymer based composition into film. The film is essentially free from gel streaking and pinstriping and does not discolor upon aging at 60aC for 4 weeks. Prior art polymer based compositions comprised a Ziegler Natta catalyzed film grade olefin polymer which contained at least one anti oxidant having a concentration between about 20 and about 5000 ppm. and an inorganic anti block compound having a concentration between about 500 ppm and about 571 by weight. The prior art inorganic anti block typically had a pH above about 8. The aforementioned prior art polymer based compositions were susceptible to gel streaking and pinstriping during formation of the film. It also has been discovered that when inorganic anti block compounds having a pH belov 6 or above 8 were present in the aforementioned prior art compositions, film that was formed discolored after aging a few weeks at 600C or months at ambient temperature. In still another aspect, the present invention relates to a masterbatch concentrate which, when admixed with a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer in pro4 portions defined herein, provides a film forming composition capable of being extruded into a film which is essentially free from gel streaking and pinstriping and which does not discolor upon aging at 60 C for 4 weeks. This invention is based upon the discovery that such prior art compositions and prior art extrusion processes may be improved by extruding a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer based composition into film in the presence of a hindered phenolic anti oxidant, an anti block compound having a substantially neutral pH, and an anti gel compound characterized by containing at least about 5 repeat units of an alkylene oxide. Preferably, the anti gel compound is characterized by having more than about 10 repeat units of an alkylene oxide. The anti gel compound typically is present in a concentration between about 25 and 10,000 ppm, based upon the weight of the polymer and has a molecular weight between about 200 and 4,000,000Daltons. The hindered phenolic anti oxidant, inorganic antiblock compound and anti gel compound are uniformly dispersed in the olefin polymer based extrudable composition. The dispersion can be effected by various dispersion techniques commonly employed by those skilled in the art of preparing extrudable composition. The three aforementioned additives could be directly introduced into the olefin polymer e.g., polyethylene via a V type blender or by mixing via a Henschel type intensive mixer.The three aforementioned additives also could be directly hot compounded into the olefin polymer or made into a masterbatch for final letdown using conventional hot processing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Werner Pfleiderer twin screw mixing extruder or a single screw mixer extruder that has pell tization equipment on the head of the extruder. The Anti G l Compound The anti gel compound of this invention may be represented by the following structural formula R A R1 n wherein R R is a hydroxyl group a C1 C24 alkyl alcohol a C1 C12 alkylated phenol a C12 C24 alkyl or alkylene amine or a C12 C24 alkyl or alkylene amide In is 1 or 2 R1 is a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl EMI10.1 wherein R2 is ethylene, propylene or mixtures thereof x is a number between about 5 and less than about 20,000 and y is a number between about 2 and about 6 andR1 is as defined hereinabove. Thase anti gel compounds are of lov volatility and have a molecular weight in the range of about 200 to about 4,000,000 Daltons, preferably in the range of about 800 to about 200,000 Daltons. Below a molecular weight of about 200 Daltons, volatility is high and causes smoking and equipment plate out problems. Above a molecular weight of about 4,000,000 Daltons and depending upon the molecular weight of the polymer, poor dispersion of the anti gel compound may occur causing gellike defects to result in the film. IF Suitable ant4 gel compounds according to the present invention include low molecular weight oligomers up to high molecular weight polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene glycols and interpolymers thereof having a molecular weight greater than about 200 and less than about 20,000 Daltons, and polyethylene and polypropylene oxides and interpolyters thereof having a molecular weight greater than about 20,000 and less than about 4,000,000 Daltons the reaction product of an alkanol with more than about 5 moles of an alkylene oxide such as ethylene or Pro ylene beside adducts of lauryl alcohol, mystearyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol and erucyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof and the reaction product of an alkyl phenol such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, un decyl, or dodecyl phenol vith more than about 5 moles of an alkylen oxide such as ethylene or propylene oxide, and mixtures thereof.

The hindered phenolic anti oxidants may be used indivi dually or in various combinations with one another or the econdary stabilizers in the compositions of the present invention. Inorganic Anti Block Compounds The extrudable compositions of the present invention contain a finaly dividet, inorganic material for use as an anti block or release reagent. It has been found that certain finely divided inorganic compounds of a substantially neutral pH do not promote discoloration between the hindered phenolic anti oxidants and the polyalkylene glycol or oxide or polyalkoxyla ed compounds used to control gel streaking and pinstriping. The anti block compounds are present in quantities that effect anti block release properties Such anounts are about 0.02 to about 5Z, and preferably about 0.08 to about 1X by veight, based on the weight of the film forming composition. The pH of the inorganic anti block is between about 6 and about 8, preferably as close to a neutral pH of 7 as possible. The average particle site of the anti block compounds of this invention are from about 0.5 to about 10 microns m , preferably from about . to about 7 microns m in diameter The average surface area of the inorganic anti block compounds of this invention are from about 1 to about 500 m2 g.

Ii Masterbatch Concentrate As previously described herein, the hindered phenolic anti oxidant, inorganic anti block compound and anti gel compound of this invention nag be admixed with a Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer via a masterbatch concentrat to yield the extrudable film forming composition of this invention. The Ziegler Natta cataly ed olefin polymer typically is admixed with the masterbatch concentrate in a letdown ratio of between about 5 and about 100 to 1 by weight. Preferably, a letdown ratio of between about 5 and about 30 to 1 by weight Is employed.The masterbatch concentrate is comprised of between about 40Z and about 98Z by weight, preferably between about 60 and about 95Z by weight, of an olefin polymer compatible with the Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer vith which the masterbatch concentrate is admixed. Compatibility of the olefin polymers can be judged by the general quality of the extruded film product in terms of the increased presence of haze, gel iike defects or gross distortions of the surface texture, commonly referred to as an applesauce or sharkskin like surface. The masterbatch concentr te further includes between about 0,1Z and about 5Z by weight of a hindered phenolic anti oxidant between about 0.1 and about 5Z by weight of the anti gel compound of this invention and between about 2X and about 48 , by weight, preferably between about 3Z and about 20Z by weight, of an inorganic anti block compound of this invention having a substantially neutral pi. Extrudable Compositions The extrudable compositions of the present invention may be used in any of the forms of such compositions which are commonly employed in the extruded film arts, such as compounds modified with various slip agents such as fatty acid asides and anti static additives for specific end use applications. These extrudable compositions are thermoplastic in nature. In addition to the olefin polymer, anti gel compound, hindered phenolic anti oxidant1 near neutral pH inorganic, anti block compound the compositions of the present invention may contain other adjutant materials which are commonly employed in olefia polymer based extrudable film compositions. Such other adjutants would include plasticizers, fillers, pigments, lubricants, slip agents, modifiers and similar materials. The fillers which may be used in the olefin polymerbased extrudable compositions of the present invention are the fillers which are commonly used with such polymer.. The fillers are used in amounts which correspond to about 1 to 20 percent by weight, based on the weight of the olefin polymer Such fillers would include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays, calcium silicates and others known in the art. The plasticizers which may be employer in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions of the present invention are the plasticizers which are commonly used with such polymers.The plasticizers are used in amounts which would correspond to about 1 to 25 percent by weight based on the weight of olefin olymer. Such plasticizers would include materials such as phthalates, phosphates, adipates, azelates, amine based polyols, and a number of other similar products. Process lubricants which are commonly employed in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions are the lubricants which are commonly used with such polymers. The lubricants are used in amounts which correspond to about 0.02 to 2 percent by weight of lubricant agent based on the weight of the olefin polymer. Examples of such lubricants are ethylene bis stearamide zinc, ealciun and or m gnesium steerates hydrocarbon vases and the like. Estrudlnz Conditions The extrudable conditions of the present invention are particularly designed for use in equipment utilized for tubular film, Cast film and extrusion coating products. Such equipment may have hold up areas or areas of stagnation that retard the flow of extrudate therethrough, leads to the development of gel streaking and pinstriping in the presence of hindered phenolic anti oxidants and in the absence of the use of the anti gel additives of the present invention.In such equipment, the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions are subjected to extrusion temperatures of about 135iC to about 340 C, and preferably about 190 C to about 340 C, under varying conditions of heat and pressure, and for periods of time of about 0.5 to 10 minutes. The film is usually prepared in sheets which are about 2.5 jim to 250 pm mils thick. According to the present invention, the olefin polymer compositions are not exposed to post reactor high tempera ture compounding or finishing which could introduce hydroperoxides into the composition prior to film extrusion. Instead the three aforementioned additives are admixed via a masterbatch concentrate or by directly dry blending the anti gel and anti oxidant compounds into tbe granular blefin polymer with the anti block compound separately admixed prior to extrusion of the composition.Another advantage of this invention is that gas treatment e.g., with propylene oxide after polymerization of the olefin polymer is not required nor are subsequent alcohol washes required to remove the propylene oxide or ethylene oxide gas products nor the subsequent drying process to remove the 1alcohol. Also unnecessary is the need for devolatilization of 1alcohols or water which could be added to neutralize and break down catalyst residue.The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation of the scope thereof.Example lPreparation of Polymer Resins Two low pressure, lov density ethylene butene l copolymers were prepared according to the procedure disclosed in South African Patent Publication No. 79 01365, published September 22, 1980, entitled Process for Making FilmProm Low Density Ethylene Rydrocarbon Copolymer by W.A. Fraser et al. The properties of the ethylene butene l copolymer were determined by the following methods Density was determined according to ASTM D 1501. A plaque vas conditioned fo one hour at 100 C to approach equilibrium crystallinity. Density is reported as gms cm Melt Index MI was determined according to ASTM D 1238, Condition E.It was measured at 190 C and 303kPa and reported as grams lQ minutes. Flow Index HLMI was measured according to ASTM D 1238, Condition F. It vas measured at 10 times the weight used in the melt index test above and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt Flow Ratio MFR was calculated as Flow IndexMelt Index. Ti, Mg, Al and Si catalyst residues in the ethylene1butene l copolymer in ppm was measured by induction coupled plasma emission spectro copy. Cl cataLyst residue in the ethylene butene l copolymer in ppm was measured by a Dohrmann micro coulometric titration system. One of the ethylane butene l copolymers, designated A, had the following properties a melt index of 1.0 a MFR of 28 a density of 0.918 gmlcm3 and a catalyst residue in ppm of Ti 2, Mg 2, A1 73, Si 56 and C1 13. The other ethylene butane i copolymer, designated B, had the following properties a melt index of 2.0 a MFR of 28 a density of 0.918 gm cm3 and a catalyst residue in ppm of Ti 3, Mg 4, A1 89, Si 97 and Cl 16. Either polymer A or B was used in the polymer compositions of all the subsequent examples herein. Preparation of Polymer Compositions One of two methods to prepare polymer compositions vas employed in the examples. In one method, the components ere dry blended in a roll drum for 20 minutes at room temperature with a virgin olefin polymer. In the other method, the components were compounded into masterbatch concentrates utilizing r Banbury batch mixer coupled to a Barrel Birmingham single screw extruder malt pump. The components were mixed in the Banbury mixer for 4 to 5 minutes, dropped at 125 C, and extruded through an extruder melt pump using a throat temperature of 104 C, o barrel temperature of 1500C and a die temperature of 150 C. Each masterbatch concentrate was admixed with a high pres ure, low density ethylene polymer having a melt index of 2.0 and a density of 0.918 gm cm3 commercially available under the trade name DED 4140 from, Union CarbideCorporation, Old Ridgebury Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06810 .This high pressure, low density polyethylene is designated asPolymer C in Table 1.

The mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 minutes and then the anti block compound was allowed to settle from the slurred mixture. The pH of the settled water slurry was measured using litmus paper capable of discerning pH values in the 4 to 12 range.Example 2 IA A series of 22 control experiments or runs were conducted to illustrate disadvantages associated with the use of olefin polymer based film extrusion formulations which did not contain one or more of the following the anti gel compound or near neutral 6 8 pH anti block compound of this invention or a hindered phenolic anti oxidant. Films extruded from the 22 control formulations exhibited blocking or gel streaking pinstriping or discoloration upon aging in the extruded film or a combination thereof. The 22 control formulations were prepared by one of the methods described hereinabove.After the control formulations were prepared, films were extruded in a tubular extrusion device for various periods of tine to assess gel formation pinstriping. The extruded films were aged at 60 C for 4 weeks to assess discoloration Por runs 1, 3 and 6 15, the following extrusion conditions were employed Film was extruded at 3 lbs hr with a 385 F melt temperature using a 1 inch Killion 24 to 1 length to diameter extruder equipped with a 1 1 4 inch die with a 0.30 inch gap. No nitrogen purge was used on the extrusion hopper. For runs 2 and 16 22, the following extrusion conditions were employed Film was extruded on a 2 1 2 inch diameter 24 to 1 length to diameter Egan extruder equipped with a 6 inch diameter Sano die having a 100 ml die gap. The extrusion rate was about 85 lbs hr 1 with a melt temperature of about 290 F. The extruded films were approximately 1.5 mils thick. During extrusion, the films were examined periodically for gel streak formation and pinstriping. After aging for 4 weeks at 60 C, the films also were examined for discoloration. Table II hereinbelow sets forth the resin control compositions employed and the results obtained with respect to gel streak formation pinstriping discoloration. The number symbols used to designate the visual appearance of the film with respect to gel streaking pinstriping discoloration have the following meanings 0 clear of gel streaking pinstriping discoloration 1 slight gel streaking pinstriping discoloration 2 moderate gel streaking pinstriping discoloration 3 3 severe gel streaking pinstriping discoloration As can be seen from a review of the information disclosed in Table It, runs 1 and 2 were made with additive free polymer control compositions, which exhibited slight gel streaking pinstriping and did not discolor upon aging at 600C for 4 weeks. The additive free polymer control compositions of runs 1 and 2 do not have long term storage stability or reprocessing stability and lack adequate handling characteristics such as anti block or non tack properties. Runs 3 5 were made with hindered phenolics anti oxidant stabilized polymer control formulations which exhibited severe gel streaking pinstriping, but no discoloration in the extruded film upon aging at 600C for 4 weeks. Runs 6 15 were made with polymer control formulations containing a hindered phenolic anti oxidant, various anti gel compounds, e.g., polyethylene glycols oxides on an ethoxylated linear alcohol. These polymer control compositions exhibited no gel streaking pinstriping and slightly di colored upon aging at 60 C for 5 weeks. The control formulations for runs 6 15 lack adequate handling characteristics such as anti block or non tack properties. Runs 16 22 were made vith polymer control formulations containing a hindered phenolic anti oxidant, various anti gel compounds, e.g., polyethylene glycol or polyethylene oxide, and an inorganic anti block compound having a pa of about 11.These polymer control formulations did not exhibit gel streaking pinstriping but became highly discolored after aging 4 weeks at 60 C. Induced blocking of the films ample conditioned for 24 hours at 60 C under a 1.0 kPa load produced with the control formulations used in runs 1 22 was measured. For runs 1 15, which did not contain an anti block compound, induced blocking values were found to be greater than 200 grams force to separate tuo film layers. For runs 16 22, which contained between 2.5 and 8Z by weight anti block compound, induced blocking values were found to be less than about 50 grams force to separate two film layers. Induced blocking values belou about 50 grams force to separate two film layers are commercially acceptable.
