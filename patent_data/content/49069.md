# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO HINGES

## Abstract
A hinge 10 for mounting a door 56 to a horizontally ex tending shelf member 58 comprises a first, shelf, bracket 12 and a second, door, bracket 14 adapted for pivotal engage ment with one another about a vertical axis. The first bracket 12 comprises a retaining guide 16 typically in the form of a generally U shaped or L shaped member for fixing to the shelf 58 so as to abut at least two adjacent faces. A slide member 20 of the first bracket 12 is arranged to be a sliding fit with respect to the guide 16 to permit adjustment of the first bracket 12 laterally of the pivot axis 46, 38 in the direction of the length of the shelf 58 . The lateral adjustment of the first bracket 12 permitted by provision of the co operating retain ing guide 16 and slide member 20 enables the lateral posi tion of the hinge pivot axis 46, 38 to be readily adjusted thus greatly facilitating correct positioning of a hinge during hang ing of a door. Also disclosed is a cupboard storage system in which a door is hung from horizontal structural members, e.g. shelves, conveniently using hinges of the invention.
