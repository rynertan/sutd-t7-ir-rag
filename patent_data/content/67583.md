# A LIQUID MEMBRANE PROCESS FOR URANIUM RECOVERY

## Abstract
A liquid membrane emulsion extraction process for recovering uranium from a WPPA feed solution containing U IV cations wherein said feed is contacted with a water in oil emulsion which extracts and captures the uranium in interior aqueous phase thereof, there being an alkane diphosphonic acid uranium complexing agent in the interior phase of the emuision.
