# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORGING TRACK LINKS

## Abstract
The invention discloses a process of forging a track link 1 for a track type vehicle undercarriage. The forging process produces links 1 that conform to very restrictive toterances without the mecessity of additional machining or finishing. The process includes a classification of n link surfaces A,B C,D,E F,F G,H,I,L,M,N O,P,P ,Q R,S to be forged and involving the whole workpiece in Nn tolerance fields AB, CDE, FF , GHILMN, OPP Q, RS . Within each of these N tolerance fields, upon shaping, trimming and double coining, each of n surfaces is maintained with an exceed ing or deficient quantity of material such as to provide, within tolerance limits, material transfers, particularly small, between one surface and the adjacent one, wherein the active subject of transfer is a surface having a reduced tolerance field to and from a surface standing a larger tolerance. The invention includes also an apparatus for forging a track link 1 to a desired finished dimension. The apparatus includes a coining die 80, 81 providing coining on at least two planes at right angles whereby coining of surfaces at right angles with die closing and opening direction is provided by transversally moveable members 86a, 86b automatically driven by inclined planes 86 a, 86 b which combine horizontal and vertical movements.
