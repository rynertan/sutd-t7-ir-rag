# Multiple document detecting system and method of detecting multiple documents.

## Abstract
A system and method for detecting the presence of two or more overlapping documents using a capacitive sensing device through which the documents are arranged to pass. A document sensing signal 42 generated in response to the detection of one or more documents is delayed by the capacitance of the sensing device which varies according to whether one or more than one document passes therethrough. The delayed signal 54 is applied to comparison means 56 together with the original document sensing signal 42 and a multiple document detect signal 70 is produced when the output of said comparison means 56 is indicative of a delay in excess of a certain amount.
