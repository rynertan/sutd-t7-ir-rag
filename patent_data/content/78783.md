## Abstract
A means for recovering the heat of a room space and for ventilation, consisting of at least two heat accumu lators 1, 2 , to which the outgoing air delivers its heat and from which the incoming air takes up heat, and each of which has one end 3, 4 coniiected to the room space outflow duct 5 and inflow duct 6 , in which ducts the direction of flow is always the same under control by a flap 7 . The opposite ends 8, 9 of the heat accumulators 1, 2 have been connected to the fresh air intake duct 10 and to tie outgoing exit duct, in which ducts the di rection of flow is always the same under control by another flap 12 .
