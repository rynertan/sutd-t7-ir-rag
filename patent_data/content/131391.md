# REFRACTORY GUN MIX

## Abstract
A low cost stabilized lime aggregate, with dicalcium sili cate as a major constituent, is used in refractory gun mixes. Slags are suitable for this purpose which contain at least 75 of total CaO Fe₂O₃ SiO₂ MgO and less than 7 of free lime and have a CaO SiO₂ weight ratio of at least 1.8.
