# Method and apparatus of treating a plurality of planar articles.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a way of separating and treating the covered surfaces of stacked articles in abutting face to face contact. It is particularly applicable to stacked planar articles, those having a relatively small width dimen sion and at least two substantially parallel surfaces in abutting contact, such as metal beverage container closures. The articles are pushed through a curvilinear path 14 defined by a constant width trackwork of a herein specified design, allowed to pivot on the portions of the articles in proximity to the shorter radius whereby fan like separation of the portions in proximity to the longer radius occurs, and treating medium, such as heated air, is directed toward the separated portions. Greater uniformity in treatment may be obtained by rotating the articles, at least once, as they traverse the curvilinear path 14 . A preferred embodiment designed to dry the sealant on metal beverage container closures is disclosed herein.
