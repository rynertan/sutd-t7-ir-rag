# Projectile obturator and projectile provided with such an obturator.

## Abstract
An obturator for a projectile 10 to be fired from a rifled barrel 12 is provided in accordance with this invention, with this obturator being mounted on the projectile in such a way as to permit rotational slippage. A preferred form of our obturator comprises a ring 16 of non metallic material, which ring is capable of being mounted on a circular body portion 20 of the projectile. An external portion of the obturator ring has a plurality of encircling slots 26 , essentially parallel to each other, which slots are rearwardly inclined so as to define a plurality of chevron like members 28 designed to forcibly engage the rifling of the barrel. The interior of the obturator ring is designed to slip rotationally with respect to the projectile body portion as the projectile travels along the barrel, thereby advantageously minimizing the rotation of the projectile as a result of rifling effects. One embodiment of an obturator 46 in accordance with this invention may be designed to disintegrate as it leaves the barrel, whereas another embodiment 16 may utilize an overwrap of high temperature filamentary material 36 in at least some of the slots, which overwrap serves to increase the hoop strength of the obturator.
