# Current source arrangement.

## Abstract
In a digital analogue converter 1 a plurality of binary weighted currents are generated, which currents must be in an accurate current ratio relative to each other. By means of a coupling network 15 which is controlled by a control circuit 17 a plurality of currents from said digital analogue converter 1 can be coupled to a precision current mirror circuit 25 in accordance with a cyclic pattern, this allowing deviations in the ratios of the currents from the digital analogue converter 1 to be detected by detection means 80 which control cor rection means 18.2 to 18.16 by means of which the currents from the digital analogue converter 1 are corrected so as to reduce the detected deviations.
