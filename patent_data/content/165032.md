## Description
This invention relates to certain dihydropyridines, specifically to certain 1,4 dihydropyridines having a substituted heterocyclic ring in a side chain attached to the 2 position, which have utility as anti ischaemic and antihypertensive agents, and to pharmaceutical preparations containing such compounds. The compounds of the invention reduce the movement of calcium into the cell and they are thus able to delay or prevent the cardiac contracture which is believed to be caused by an accumulation of intracellular calcium under ischaemic conditions.Excessive calcium influx during ischaemia can have a number of additional adverse effects which would further, compromise the ischaemic myocardium. These include less efficient use of oxygen for ATP production, activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and possibly, promotion of cell necrosis. Thus the compounds are useful in the treatment or prevention of a variety of cardiac conditions, such as angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks and cardiac hypertrophy. The compounds also have vasodilator activity since they can inhibit calcium influx in cells of vascular tissue and they are thus alsatuseful as antihypertensive agents and for the treatment of coronary vasospasm. According to the specification of our European patent application publication no. 60674 there are described and claimed a number of dihydropyridine anti ischaemic and antihypertensive agents wherein the 2 position of the dihydropyridine ring is substituted with certain N,N disubstituted aminoalkoxymethyl groups. Our European patent application publication no. 100189 describes and claims a related series of compounds wherein the 2 position is substituted with an aromatic heterocyclylalkoxymethyl group. We have now discovered a further series of dihydropyridine compounds having valuable therapeutic properties wherein the 2 position substituent bears an alkoxy substitutedheterocyclylalkoxymethyl group. Thus according to the invention, there are provided novel 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives of the formula EMI2.1 and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts wherein R is aryl or heteroaryl R1 and R2 are each independently C1 C4 alkyl or 2 niethoxyethyl X is a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclic ring which is substitated with one or more OR groups and which may optionally be additionally substituted with one or more C1 C4 alkyl, aryl, hydroxy, oxo, CN, N R4 2, CH2 mCON R4 2 or CH2 mCO2R5 groups R3 is C1 C4 alkyl each R4 is independently H or C1 C4 alkyl or the 4 two groups R are taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form a pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, morpholino, piperazinyl or N C1 C4 alkyl piperazinyl group R5 is H or C1 C4 alkyl Y is CH2 n , CH2CH C113 or CH2C CH3 2 m is 0 or 1 and n is 1 to 3 when X is linked to Y by a ring carbon atom, or on 2 or 3 when X is linked to Y by a ring nitrogen atom. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are those formed from acids which form non toxic acid. addition salts, for example the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate or. bisulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, lactate, maleate, succinate and tart rate salts. For compounds with an acidic substituent salts may also be formed with bases examples are the sodium, potassium and ammonium salts. The term aryl as used in this specification includes phenyl and. phenyl substituted by one or two substituents each independently selected from nitro, halo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl and cyano. It also includes 1and 2 naphthyl. The term heteroaryl as used in this specification for R means an aromatic heterocyclic group which may optionally be substituted and includes, for example, benzofuranyl benzothienyl pyridyl optionally substituted by methyl, methylthio, cyano or halo quinolyl, benzoxazolyl benzothiazolyl furyl pyrimidinyl thiazolyl 2,1, 3 benzoxadiazol 4 yl 2,1,3 benzothiadiazol 4 yl and thienyl optionally monosubstituted by halo or C1 C4 alkyl. The 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclie ring X may contain from one to three nitrogen atoms in the ring and may be linked to the group Y either by a ring carbon or a ring nitrogen atom, with the proviso that, if X is linked by a ring nitrogen atom, Y must contain at least two carbon atoms i.e. n ta 2 or 3 . iamples of suitable heterocyclic rings include pyrimidinyl, pyrazolinyl, imidazolyl and tria olyi. The substituent ax is preferably methoxy. In addition the OR group, the heterocyclic ring X may contain further substituents. Preferred substituent groups are amino, C1 C4 alkyl, particularly methyl, and hydroxy or oxo groups. As willl be understood by those skilled in the art the hydroxy or oxo substituents, if present , can be subject to keto enol tautomerism and the group may be present either as a free hydroxy group when in the tautomeric enol form, or as an oxo group when in the keto form. Thus particular examples of X include 4 methoxy 2methylpyrimidin 6 yl 4 isopropoxy 2 methylpyrimidin 6 yl 2 amino 4 methoxypyrimidin 6 yl, 2 methoxy 4 pyrimidon 6 yl, and 2,4dimethoxypyrimidin 6 yl.

Y is preferably CH2 2 when X is linked to Y by a ring nitrogen atom, or CH2 when X is linked to Y by a ring carbon atom. Thus, particular examples of compounds of the invention include the following 6 t 4 2,3 Dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5 methoxy carbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 4 methoxy 2 methylpyrimidine 6 4 2,3 Dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5 methoxy carbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 4 isopropoxy 2 methylpyrimidine 2 Amino 6 4 2,3 dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 4 methoxypyrimidine 6 3,5 Bismethoxycarbonyl 4 2,3 dichlorophenyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yI methoxymethyl 2,4 dimethoxypyrimidine and 6 4 2,3 Dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5 methoxy carbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxyethyl 2 methoxy 4 pyrimidona. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by a number of different processes according to the invention In one process the compounds of formula r can be prepared front the corresponding compound of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R, RÚ, Rê and Y are as previously defined and xÚ is a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing heterocyclic group as defined for X except that the ring does not contain aa OR substituent group but instead is substituted by halogen, especially chlorinesor S C1 C4 alkyl by reacting with an alkoxide of the formula R O III where R is as previously defined, formed by reacting an alcohol of the formula R OH with a strong base, for example sodium hydride. The reaction is generally performed by preparing the anion of the alcohol of formula III and then adding the compound of formula II in more or less equimolar quantities. For the simple lower alkanols of formula III the reaction can be performed using excess alcohol as solvent, and a period of several days at room temperature may be required before the reaction is substantially complete. The desired product is isolated and purified using conventional procedures. In an alternative procedure for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein R is methyl, the corresponding compound of formula II wherein XÚ has a hydroxy substituent instead of OR is reacted with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate. The reaction is performed in a conventional manner by adding the methylating agent to a cooled solution of the hydroxy substituted compound in an organic solvent, for example dichloromethane. The reaction is generally complete after several hours at room temperature and the product is isolated and purified using conventional procedures. The starting materials of formula II wherein X1 is substituted with hydroxy groups are described in our co pendingBritish Patent application number 8319886. The starting compounds of formula II wherein v is substituted with halo groups are prepared from the corresponding hydroxy substituted compounds for example chloro substituted compounds can be prepared from the hydroxy substituted starting materials by reaction with phosphorus oxychloride. In a further process, compounds of the formula I wherein X is a 2 methoxy 4 pyrtiidon 6 yl group are prepared from a compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R, RÚ, Rê and Y are as previously defined and R6 is C1 C4 alkyl by reacting with O methylisourea hydrogen sulphate. The reaction is performed with the reactants dissolved in an organic solvent e.g. ethanol, in the presence of a base e.g.1,3 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene. A period of several days at room temperature may be required and the product is then isolated and purified by conventlonal procedures. The starting materials of formula IV are described in ourBritish patent application no. 8319886. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the movement of calcium into the cell is shown by their effectiveness in reducing the contraction of vascular tissue in vitro which is the consequence of calcium influx caused by a high extracellular concentration of potassium ions. The test is performed by mounting spirally cut strips of rat aorta with one end fixed and the other attached to a force transducer. The tissue is immersed in a bath of physiological saline solution containing calcium ions at a concentration of 2.5 millimolar and potassium ions at a concentration of 5.9 millimolar. Potassium chloride solution is added to the bath with a pipette to give a final potassium ion concentration of 45 millimolar. The change in tension caused by the resulting contraction of the tissue is noted.The bath is drained and refilled with fresh saline solution containing the particular compound under test. After 45 minutes, the procedure is repeated and the contraction again noted. The concentration of compound required to reduce the response by 50 is determined. The antihypertensive activity of the compounds is evaluated after oral administration by measuring the fall in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats or renally hypertensive dogs. For administration to man in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions and hypertensicn, oral dosages of the compounds will generally be in the range of from 20 200 mg daily for an average adult patient 70 kg . Thus for a typical adult patient, individual tablets or capsules contain from 5 to 20 mg of active compound, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicleror carrier.Dosages for intravenous administration would typically be within the range I to 10 mg per single dose as required In practice the physician will determIne the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patients The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. For human use, the compounds of the formula I can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. Thus in a further aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier The invention also includes a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in medicine, in particular in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease, angina, or hypertension in a human being.
