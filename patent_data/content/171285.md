## Description
Method of Operating Zinc Bromide Electrolyte Secondary Battery The present invention relates to a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery which can be used, for example, for the purpose of load levelling by storing night time surplus electric power and discharging stored electric power during daytime, or as a power source for vehicles. Generally, this type of known secondary battery comprises a battery body containing positive and negative electrolytes, a circulating system for circulating the electrolytes through the battery body an electrolyte storage tank being included in the circulating system. The battery body usually comprises a stack of a plurality of unit secondary cells. The unit secondary cell includes a positive electrode and a negative electrode opposed at a predetermined distance apart and a separator arranged between the positive and negative electrodes so as to define a positive electrode chamber between it and the positive electrode, and a negative electrode chamber between it and the negative electrode. The positive electrolyte is contained in the positive electrode chamber and the negative electrolyte is contained in the negative electrode chamber. The circulating system includes a positive electrolyte circulating system and a negative electrolyte circulating system. The positive electrolyte system includes a positive electrolyte circulating pipe means arranged such that the positive electrolyte leaving the positive electrode chambers of each of the unit secondary cells is gathered and returned again by a pump to the positive electrode chambers. The negative electrolyte circulating system similarly includes a negative electrolyte circulating pipe means arranged such that the negative electrolyte leaving the negative electrode chambers of each of the unit secondary cells is gathered and returned again by a pump to the negative electrode chambers. The tank includes a positive electrolyte storage tank and a negative electrolyte storage tank and the positive electrolyte storage tank is included in the positive electrolyte circulating pipe means. Likewise, the negative electrolyte storage tank is included in the negative electrolyte circulating pipe means. The positive electrolyte comprises a solution of zinc bromide, a supporting electrolyte and a complexing agent which converts bromine molecules to a complex compound. In addition to these, upon charging, the positive electrolyte produces and contains bromine molecules and a complex compound of bromine molecules.The negative electrolyte comprises a solution of zinc bromide, a dendrite inhibitor, a supporting electrolyte and a bromine complexing agent. The separator is made of an ion permeable porous membrane which prevents the permeation of bromine molecules and the bromine complex compound from the positive electrode chamber to the negative electrode chamber. During the charging and discharging, the following oxidation reduction reactions take place. During charging the zinc ioas in the negative electrode chamber are attracted to the negative electrode so that the zinc ions are provided with electrons and reduced on the surface of the negative electrode, thus depositing themselves as a zinc metal on the surface of the negative electrode. On the other hand, the zinc ions in the positive electrode chamber permeate through the separator and enter into the negative electrode chamber thereby similarly depositing themselves as a zinc metal. In this case, the bromine ions in the positive electrode chamber are attracted to the positive electrode so that the bromine ions lose their electrons and are oxidised on the surface of the positive electrode, thereby depositing themselves as bromine atoms on the surface of the positive electrode.A bromine molecule is formed by the bonding of two bromine atoms and the resulting bromine molecules are dissolved in the positive electrolyte. Also, the bromine ions in the negative electrode chamber permeate through the separator and enter into the positive electrode chamber where, similarly, they are formed into bromine molecules and dissolved in the positive electrolyte. A considerable proportion of these bromine molecules dissolved in the positive electrolye is converted to a bromine complex compound by the complexing agent in the electrolyte and it is then removed from the reaction system.Since the separator is made of a porous membrane which prevents the permeation of bromine molecules and the bromine complex compounds, the bromine molecules and the complex compounds remaining in the positive electrolyte are prevented from diffusing into the negative elctrolyte and they are retained in the positive electrolyte. During discharge, the zinc metal deposited on the surface of the negative electrode is now gradually oxidized from its surface so that it is converted to zinc ions and enters into the negative electrolyte while leaving the electrons on the negative electrode. A proportion of the zinc ions entering into the negative electrolyte permeates through the separator and enters into the positive electrolyte of the positive electrode chamber. In this case, the bromine molecules in the positive electrolyde are provided with electrons from the positive electrode on its surface and are reduced. Thus, they are converted to bromine ions and diffused into the positive electrolyte. The bromine ions diffused into the positive electrolyte permeate through the separator and are diffused into the negative electrolyte of the negative electrode chamber. The complex compound of bromine molecules is decomposed due to a decrease in the concentration of the bromine molecules in the positive electrolyte, and consequently the concentration of the bromine molecules in the positive electrolyte is maintained constant. With the secondary battery used for the purpose of storing the night time surplus electric power or as a power source for vehicles, in order to ensure effective utilization of electric power, it is essential that the charged electric power is stored efficiently. However, the zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery described above is disadvantageous in that, as the storage battery is used by charging and discharing it, the voltaic efficiency the ratio of the discharged voltage to the charged voltage and the coulombic efficiency the ratio of the discharged amount of electricity to the charged amount of electricity deteriorate and therefore the energy or the product of the voltaic efficiency and the coulombic efficiency is decreased, thereby making it difficult efficiently to utilize the electric power. In order to prevent the energy efficiency from decreasing, the following means have been adopted heretofore a In the case of a secondary battery indicated inEuropean Patent Publication No. 89433 published onSept. 28, 1983, an additional electrode is provided in the vicinity of each of the positive electrolyte inlet and outlet channels of each unit secondary cell, and the additional electrodes are connected to the positive electrode of said each unit secondary cell by a connector, thus absorbing a shunt current flowing into the positive electrode chamber of the unit secondary cell by these electrodes, and preventing the occurrence of abnormal electrode deposition.b In the case of a secondary battery indicated in our prior European Patent Publication No. 112068 published on June 27, 1984, an electrically conductive carbon fiber sheet having numerous small pores is affixed to the surface of the electrically conductive carbon plastic electrode and the electrical resistance of the electrode is reduced, whereby the energy efficiency of the secondary battery is improved. In any of the foregoing cases, however, a stable and high energy efficiency could not be obtained. On the other hand, as the zinc bromide electrolyte battery is an aqueous solution type battery to be operated at normal temperatures, it is usually operated at room temperature. But, when the room temperature goes up to 350C or more in summer or it goes down to OOC or less in winter for example, it is found that the energy defficiency of the battery varies according to variation of room temperature and environmental temperature. Further, when the battery is in operation, the temperature of electrolyte goes up. It has been affirmed by many experiments that the energy efficiency of the battery is decreased in accordance with the rise or decrease of temperature of electrolyte. It is one object of the present invention to provide a method for operating a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery which reduces deterioration in the energy efficiency of the secondary battery during its use and ensures effective utilisation of the charged and discharged electric power. According to one aspect of the present invention a method of operating a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery which includes at least one unit secondary cell 1 having a pair of electrodes 2,4 located at a predetermined distance apart, an ionpermeable separator 10 arranged between said pair of electrodes 2,4 so as to define a positive electrode chamber 6 between said separator 10 and one 4 of said electrodes and a negative electrode chamber 8 between said separator 10 an the other 2 of said electrodes, and a positive electrolye 12 and a negative electrolyte 14 each comprising an aqueous solution of zinc bromide and respecively disposed in the positive and negative electrode chambers, is characterised in that each of said positive electrolyte 12 and said negative electrolyte 14 is maintained, by temperature controlling means 30,32 , at a temperature or temperatures within a predetermined temperature range. Desirably the predetermined temperature range is 200 to 400C. The positive and negative electrolytes are preferably caused to flow in and out of said positive and negative electrode chambers, respectively, by electrolyte circulation means which may include tanks for the positive and negative electrolyte and separate temperature controlling means may be associated with said tanks. According to another aspect of the present invention a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery system includes at least one unit secondary cell 1 having a pair of electrodes 2,4 located at a predetermined distance apart, an ion permeable separator 10 arranged between said pair of electrodes 2,4 so as to define a positive electrode chamber 6 between the said separator 10 and a positive one of said electrodes 4 and a negative electrode chamber 8 between said separator 10 and the other, negative, electrode 2 , and a positive electrolyte 12 and a negative electrolyte 14 each comprising an aqueous solution of zinc bromide and respectively disposed in the positive and negative electrode chambers, is characterised by temperature controlling means 30,32 for maintaining the positive electrolyte and negative electrolyte temperature or temperatures within a predetermined temperature range. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways, but one specific embodiment will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an electrolyte cirulation typ secondary battery having a temperature controller for ccntrolling the temperature of the electrolytes Figures 2 to 5 are graphs for four different electrodes, respectively, which show variations of the coulombic efficiency, voltaic efficiency and energy efficiency with the temperature of the electrolytes in a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery Figure 6 is a graph showing the variation of the coulombic efficiency with the temperature of the electrolytes in a zinc zinc battery using an aqueous solution of zinc bromide, and Figure 7 are microphotographs showing the metallic zinc deposited on the surface of the negative electrodes in an electrolyte circulation type zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery. A method of operating a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery embodying the present invention features that the electrolytes of the secondary battery are maintained at a temperature within a predetermined temperature range. As shown in Figure 1, a unit secondary cell 1 for an electrolyte circulation type secondary battery, includes a pair of negative and positive electrodes 2 and 4, respectively, having a predetermined distance therebetween, a separator 10 arranged between the pair of electrodes 2 and 4 to divide the unit secondary cell 1 into a positive electrode chamber 6 and a negative electrode chamber 8, a positive electrolyte 12 in the positive electrode chamber 6, a negative electrolyte 14 in the negative electrode chamber 8, a positive electrolyte circulating pump 16, and a negative electrolyte circulating pump 18. Each of the positive electrolyte 12 and the negative electrolyte 14 comprises an aqueous solution of zinc bromide, a supporting electrolyte, and a bromine complexing agent. Added to the positive electrolyte 12 is a complexing agent for converting bromine molecles to a complex compound, so that, upon charging, the positive electrolyte 12 produces and contains bromine molecules and a complex compound of bromine molecules. The negative electrolyte 14 further comprises a dendrite inhibitor. The separator 10 is an ion permeable porous membrane of the type which prevents the permeation of bromine molecules and bromine complex compounds. Where a trace amount of bromine molecules diffuses into the negative electrode chamber 8, the complexing agent is also added to the negative electrolyte 14. A positive electrolyte circulating pipe 20 is connected in loop form to the positive electrode chamber 6 so that the positive electrolyte 12 in the positive electrolyte chamber 6 is recirculated. The positive electrolyte circulating pipe 20 includes the pump 16 for circulating the positive electrolyte 12 in the direction of the arrows a, and a positive electrode storage tank 22. As in the case of the positive electrode chamber 6, a negative electrolyte circulating pipe 24 is connected in loop form to the negative electrode chamber 8 so that the negative electrolyte 14 in the negative electrode chamber 8 is similarly recirculated.The negative electrolyte circulating pipe 24 includes the pump 18 for circulating the negative electrolyte 14 in the direction of the arrows b, and a negative electrolyte storage tank 26. waoh of the electrodes 2 and 4 is made of a conductive carbon black plastics plate. This conductive carbon black plastics plate can be produced by, for example, mixing polyethylene or Teflon P.T.F.E. having excellent bromine resistance and a density of 0.94 g cm3 or more, and conductive carbon black and or graphite in proportions of 80 to 60 wt. for the former and 20 to 40 wt. for the latter, kneading and then forming the material into a plate. At least one of the opposing surfaces of the pair of electrodes 2 and 4 is integrally adhered and covered with a carbon fiber sheet 28. The purpose of integrally covering the surface of either one or both of the electrodes 2 and 4 with the carbon fiber sheet 28 is to increase the surface area of the positive electrode and or the negative electrode, facilitate the electro chemical reactions at the surface of the positive electrode and or the negative electrode and increase the energy efficiency. The carbon fiber is used in the form of sheets because in this way the carbon fiber can be handled conveniently. The carbon fiber sheets may for example be in the form of a woven cloth or alternatively they may be made to take any other form such as felt or knitted fabric.The carbon fiber sheet should preferably have a weight per unit area of 40 to 180 g m2, a thickness of 0.25 to 0.56 mm, a porosity of 3 to 15 , a carbon fiber pore diameter of 1.0 to 45 nm and a pore volume of 0.1 to 1.5 cm3 g. The positive electrolyte 12 and or the negative electrolyte 14 is cooled and or heated and its liquid temperature is maintained within a range of 20 to 400C.In Figure 1, a positive electrolyte temperature controller 30 is provided for the positive electrolyte storage tank 22, and a negative electrolyte temperature controller 32 is provided for the negative electrolyte storage tank 26. The positive electrolyte temperature controller 30 and the negative electrolyte teperature controller 32 respectively include means for cooling and or heating the positive electrolyte 12 and the negative electrolyte 14, and they are adapted respectively to maintain the temperature of the positive electrolyte 12 and the negative electrolyte 14 between 20 and 400C. When the temperature of the positive electrolyte 12 and the negative electrolyte 14 are respectively maintained between 20 and 400C by the positive electrolyte temperature controller 30 and the negative electrolyte temperature controller 32, the internal resistance of the electrolyte circulation type secondary battery is controlled at a decreased value and deterioration of the energy efficiency is decreased thereby ensuring effective utilization of the charged and discharged electric power. The following example substantiates the foregoing description.Example 1 The electrolyte circulation type secondary battery used in this example was a bipolar type zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery comprising ten unit secondary cells stacked in series. In this secondary battery, each of the electrodes was made of a carbon black plastics plate each side of which had a surface area of 400 cm2. It is to be noted that four different electrodes A to D were used having the following characteristics. ELectrode A the electrode had a specific resistance p 0.47 Q.cm, and a linear expansion coefficient ct 23.78 x 10 5 K, and a carbon fiber sheet was integrally adhered by heat compression bonding only to the positive electrode surface. The sheet had weight per unit area of 82 g m2, a thickness of 0.48mm, a pore volume of 0.8 cm3 g, a carbon fiber pore diameter of 1.5 to 12 nm and a porosity of 13.7 . Electrode B the electrode had a specific resistance e 0.08 JL.cm and a linear expansion coefficient 8.2 x 10 5 K and a carbon fiber sheet was integrally adhered by heat compression bonding only to the positive electrode surface. The sheet had a weight per unit area of 85 g m2, a thickness of 0.47 mm, a pore volume of 0.4 cm3 g, a carbon fiber pore diameter of 1.5 to 30 nm and a porosity of 7.2 . Electrode C the electrode of the same characteristics as the electrode A was used. The same carbon fiber sheet as in the case of the electrode A was integrally adhered by heat compression bonding to the positive and negative electrode surfaces. Electrode D the electrode of the same characteristics as the electrode B was used and the same carbon fiber sheet as in the case of the electrode B was integrally adhered by heat compression bonding to the positive and negative electrode surfaces. Also, in these examples, the charging and discharging currents were 10A and the charging and dischargng times were 8 hours. The state of charging was 67 and the temperatures of the electrolytes were between 150C and 500C and 60 C. From the results of these examples the coulombic efficiency, the voltaic efficiency and the energy efficiency shown in Figures 2 to 5, respectively, were obtained. Figure 2 shows the characteristics of the electrode A , Figure 3 the characteristics of the electrode B , Figure 4 the characteristics of the electrode C and Figure 5 the characteristics of the electrode D . In the Figures, the curve a indicates the coulombic efficiency, the curve b the voltaic efficiency and the curve c the energy efficiency. As shown in the Figures, the coulombic efficiency tends to start decreasing when the electrolyte temperature is about 300C and rapidly decreases when the temperature exceeds 400C in the case of the electrodes A , B , C and D , respectively. In the case of the electrode A , the voltaic efficiency gradually increases up to the electrolyte temperature of about 400C and it tends to decrease as the electrolyte temperature exceeds 400C. In the cae of the electrode B , the voltaic efficiency increases with increase in the electrolyte temperature. In the case of the electrode C , the voltaic efficiency gradually increases up to the electrolyte temperature of about 300C and tends to start decreasing as the temperature exceeds 300C. In the case of the electrode D , the voltage efficiency increases with increase in the electrolyte temperature up to 500C and it rapidly decreases as the temperature exceeds 500C. The energy effficiency given in terms of the product of the coulombic efficiency and the voltaic efficiency, and indicated in each case by curve c , shows the maximum value in the electrolyte temperature range of 200C to 490C and tends to decrease rapidly as the temperature exceeds 400C with each of the electrodes A , B , C and D . It is consider that the energy efficiency of the zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery decreases with increase or decrease in the temperature of the electrolyte due to the following reasons i to iv . i The increase in the internal resistance of the electrolytes. ii The increase in the activation over voltage for charging transfer reaction and the concentration activation over voltage. iii The increase in the self discharging rate of the zinc metal due to the bromine molecules. iv The decrease in the adhesion of the deposited zinc metal to the surface of the negative electrodes due to the coarsening of the crystals in the deposited zinc. These facts will be illustrated further by the following examples.Example 2 A zinc zinc battery using metallic zinc for both of its positive and negative electrodes and not using the separator was made with a view to maintaining constant the concentration of the zinc ions in the electrolyte and investigating variations of the coulombic efficiency only due to the temperature changes of the electrolyte, the temperature of the zinc bromide electrolyte was varied between 200C and 500C, and charging and discharging experiments were effected. The results of the experiments showed the variation of the coulombic efficiency as shown inFigure 6. From the Figure it will be seen that the coulombic efficiency decreases as the temperature of the electrolyte exceeds 400C irresepctive of the concentration of the zinc bromide in the electrolyte. Example 3 A zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery was charged at an electrolyte temperature of 300C and another zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery was charged at the electrolyte temperature of 500C thereby depositing metallic zinc on the surfaces of the negative electrodes. The forms of the thus deposited metallic zinc in these batteries were observed through a microscope. Figure 7 shows the microphotographs of the deposited metallic zinc, a shows the case at the electrolyte temperature of 300 C and b shows the case at the electrolyte temperature of 500C. From these photographs it will be seen that increase in the electrolyte temperature decreases the rate of deposition reaction of the zinc at the surface of the negative electrodes and hence coarsens the crystal grains in the deposited zinc.It is considered that the coarsening of the crystal grains deteriorates the adhesion of deposited zinc at the surface of the negative electrodes. Thus, it is considered that this deterioration in the adhesion of metallic zinc deposited at the surface of the negative electrodes constitutes a cause of the fact that the coulombic efficiency decreases rapidly when the electrolyte temperature exceeds 400C as investigated by Example 2.Example 4 Using a zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery, the electrolyte temperature was varied from 200C up to 500C and the resulting self discharging rates loss in weight of zinc after self dis arging weight of zinc befc e self discharging x 100 were examined. The electrolyte of the zinc bromide electrolyte secondary battery consisted of an aqueous solution of 3 mol zinc bromide containing 2.26 x 10 3 mop 2 of bromine. The self discharging rates were as shown in the following Table 1. Table 1Electrolyte Self discharginq rate day C 20 0.26 30 0.40 40 0.60 50 0.89 From Table 1 it will be seen that the selfdischarging rate at the electrolyte temperature of 500C shows an increase of 0.29 day as compared with that at the electrolyte temperature of 400C. This increase in the self discharging rate is smaller than the rapid decrease in the coulombic efficiency which took place when the electrolyte temperature exceeded 400C as shown in Example 2. Thus, it is considered that the decrease in the coulombic efficiency due to the self discharging rate of the deposited zinc is not so great.
