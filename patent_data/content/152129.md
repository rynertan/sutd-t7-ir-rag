## Description
N ACYL AMINO ACID DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS FUNGICIDES This invention relates to N acyl amino acid derivatives, to a process for their preparation, and to use of such derivatives as fungicides. European Patent Application Publication No. 57 027 discloses fungicidal compositions containing, as active ingredient, compounds of general formulaEMI1.1 and salts and esters thereof wherein R2 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group. Compounds of formula II, which areN acyl amino acid derivatives, may be prepared as described in EP A 57027 or in J. Biol. Chem. 1963, 283, No. 12, p. 3999 or by procedures such as described in US Patent No. 3,154,578 or obvious modifications thereof. There has now been discovered a novel class of N acyl amino acid derivatives having useful fungicidal activity. According to the present invention there is provided anN acyl amino acid derivative of general formula EMI1.2 or a salt or ester thereof, wherein X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom, R1 is an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl group or an optionally substituted alkylamino, cycloalkylamino, arylamino or aralkylamino group,R2 is an optimally substituted alkyl, cycloaltyl or aryl group and R is a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group. Optional substituents include for example halogen atoms and alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl and phenoxy groups, any alkyl moiety present preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms. In respect of R2 and R , an alkyl group preferably has up to 6, especially up to 4, carbon atoms an aryl group is preferably a phenyl group and a cycloalkyl group preferably has from 3 to 6 carbon atans. R2 is preferably a methyl group. R3 is preferably a hydrogen atan. Preferably X is an oxygen atan. In respect of R1, conveniently an alkyl or haloalkyl group may have up to 20 carbon atans, an alkenyl group 2 to 10 carbon atans, a cycloalkyl group 3 to 10 carbon atoms, an aryl group is pbenyl and an aralkyl group is benzyl. Preferably, RÚ is a C1 10 alkyl or haloalkyl group, aC2 10 alkenyl group, a C3 8 alkoxycarbonylalkyl group, a C3 8 cycloalkyl group or a phenyl or benzyl group optionally substituted by one or more substituents independEntly selected from C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen, and nitro moieties, or aC1 6 alkylamino group, a C38 cycloalkyl amino group, a phenylmethylamino group optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen and nitro moieties or a C3 8 alkoxycarbonylalkylamino group. Advantageously, RÚ is a C1 10 alkyl group wherein when the alkyl group contains 4 to 10 carbon atoms, the alpha carbon atan is a tertiary carbon atan attached to the C X group and three alkyl groups, or is a linear C11 20 alkyl group, a C3 8 alkenyl group, a cyclohexyl group, an ethoxycarbonylethyl group, a phenyl, trimethylphenyl or benzyl group, or a methylamino, cyclohexylamino, phenylamino, chloro or nitrophenylamino or ethoxycarbonylmethylamino group. When RÚ is an alkyl group it is preferably a C1 5 alkyl group. Typical metal salts of derivatives of formula I are the alkali metal salts, e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium salts. Typical non metal salts include anrnum salts, for example those in which the cation has the formula NR4R5R6R7 in which each of R4, R5, R6 and R7 independently represents a hydrogen atan or an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms. optional substituents include for example halogen atoms and alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl and phenoxy groups, any alkyl moiety present preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms.Isopropylammonium is an example of a suitable such cation. Further suitable armrxlium salts include those in which the nitrogen atan forms part of a saturated or unsaturated ring, which may also contain one or more additional hetero atoms, especially nitrogen, oxygen and or sulphur atoms. Typical salts of this type are pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium and morpholinium salts. Further suitable salts include those with polymeric substances containing basic groups, such as ion exchange resins. Such salts can be especially useful in applications where insoluble materials are required. Preferred esters of derivatives of formula I are unsubstituted alkyl esters preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, especially butyl esters, and substituted or unsubstituted ben2yl esters, e.g. p nitrbenzyl esters. A derivative according to the invention may advantageously be in the form of the free acid or the sodium salt. It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula I contain an asymmetric carbon atan at the 2 position and hence will exist in two optically isareric forms, which will not necessarily have equal fungicidal activity Individual optical isomers, together with mixtures of isomers, such as racemic mixtures, are included within the scope of this invention. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of a derivative of formula I or a salt or ester thereof, which comprises reacting a compound of general formulaEMI4.1 or a salt or ester thereof, wherein R and are as defined above with a compound of formulaEMI4.2 or R4 N C X IV wherein X is as defined above, R4 is an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl group and L is a suitable leaving group, and optionally converting the resulting acid, salt or ester into another acid, salt or ester, in known manner. Catpcunds of formula III are acyl or thioacyl derivatives and are either known compounds or are obtainable by analogous processes to those for preparing known compounds. L in formulaIII may conveniently be a chlorine or bromine atan or a group of formula EMI4.3 4 where X and R are as defined above. When L is a group of forimila V, the two moieties R4 may be the same or different. Compounds of formula IV are isocyanates or isothiocyanates. The process of the invention may be effected in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as ether diethyl ether and 1,2 dimethoxyethane, and haloalkanes, such as methylene chloride. Reaction may conveniently be effected at temperatures in the range fran 20 C through ambient temperature to 100 C. If it is desired to prepare a single optical isomer of the required compound, this may be done by using as starting material the appropriate optical isaer of the compound of formula II. Further in accordance with the invention there is provided a fungicidal ccmposition which ccoprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, a derivative of formula I or a salt or ester thereof as defined above. A composition according to the invention preferably contains from 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating fungicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminum silicates, for example attapulgites and vermicul ites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium caabnate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and polymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example a acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Fungicidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated fran which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of.snall amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example, a composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the protestant activity of the compounds of this invention is the use of a carrier which will provide a slow release of the fungicidal compounds into the enviroment of the plant which is to be protected. Such slow release formulations could, for example, be inserted in the soil adjacent to the roots of a vine plant, or could include an adhesive cxx xzoent enabling them to be applied directly to the stem of a vine plant. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Ihe compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable poedeers usually contain 25, 50 or 75Fw of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10Ow of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable pcwder hut without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a coMposition usually containing 10Fw of active ingredient.Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS irish 1.676 0.152mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 25 w active ingredient and 0 10Ow of additives such as stabilisers, slaw release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 1 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20Fw v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10Fw of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. The oompositions may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds. possessing pesticidal, especially insecticidal, acaricidal, herbicidal or fungicidal, properties. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for exarrple compositions attained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. the said erriilsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil inrwater type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency, The invention still further provides the use as a fungicide of a derivative of the general formula I or a salt or an ester thereof as defined above, and a method for combating fungus at a locus, which caprices treating the locus, which may for example be plants subject to or subjected to fungal attack, seeds of such plants or the medium in which such plants are growing or are to be grown, with such a derivative. The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crop plants against fungal attack. Typical crops which may he protected include vines, tobacco, potato, tanato, lettuce and cocoa. The present invention is of particular value in the protection of vines against fungal disease, such as downy mildew, Plasmopara viticola, because of the ability of the active compounds to provide a protective effect in those parts of the vine plant romote fran the site of application.Thus, if the upper surfaces of leaves of a vine are sprayed, the plant becomes more resistant to fungal attack not only on the leaf undersurfaces translaminar protection but also on the plant surfaces emerging after the treatment. The active material may also be effective when applied to the stem or roots of the plant s to be protected. The duration of such protection is normally dependent on the individual compound selected, and also a variety of external factors, such as climate, whose impact is normally mitigated by the use of a suitable formulation.

Assessment is visual and is based on the percentage of the leaf area covered by sporulation ccmpared with that on control leaves.b Translaminar activity against vine downy mildew Plasopara viticola P.v.t The test is a translaminar protestant one using a foliar spray. The upper surfaces of leaves of whole vine plants are sprayed at a dosage of 1 kilogram of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . The lower surfaces of the leaves are then inoculated, up to 6 hours after treatement, with the test compound, by spraying with an aqueous suspension containing 105 zoosporangia ml. The inoculated plants are kept for 24 hours in a high humidity ccnçxzrbnent, 5 days at glasshouse ambient temperature and humidity and then returned for a further 24 hours to high humidity. Assessment is based on the percentage of the leaf area covered by sporulation compared with that on control leaves.c Direct protectant activity against vine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola P.v.p The test is a direct protestant one using a foliar spray.The lower surfaces of leaves of whole vine plants cv Cabernet Saavignon are sprayed at a dosage of 1 kilogram of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a , and after a subsequent 24 hours under normal glasshouse conditions the lower surfaces of the leaves are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous solution containing 104 zoosporangia mI. The inoculated plants are kept for 24 hours in a high humidity compartment, 5 days under normal glasshouse conditions and then returned for a furter 24 hours to high humidity. Assessment is based on the percentage of leaf area covered by sporulation carpared with that on control leaves.d Activity against apple powdery mildew Podosphaera leucotriha P.1 The test is a direct anti sporulant one using a foliar spray. The upper surfaces of leaves of whole apple seedlings are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous suspension containing 105 conidia ml 2 days prior to treatment with the test compound. The inoculated plants are immediately dried and kept at glasshouse ambient teeerateees and humidity prior to treatment.The plants are sprayed at a dosage of 1 kilogram of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After drying the plants are returned to a compartment at ambient temperature and humidity for up to 9 days, followed by assessment. Assessment is based on the percentage of the leaf area covered by sporulation compared with that on leaves of control plants.e Activity against wheat leafspot Leptosphaeria nodoum Ln. The test is a direct antisporulant one, using a foliar spray. leaves of wheat plants cv Mardler , at the single leaf stage, are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous suspension containing 8 x 10 spcres ml. The inoculated plants are kept for 24 horus in a high humidity compartment prior to treatment.The plants are sprayed at a dosage 1kg. of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After drying, the plants are kept for 5 days ys under normal glass house conditions, followed by assessment. Assessment is based on the percentage of leaf area convered by sporulation compared with that on leaves of control plants. The extent of disease control in all the above tests is expressed as a rating compared with a diluent sprayed control according to the criteria O less than 50 disease control 1 about 50 80 disease control 2 greater than 80 disease control Results of the above tests are given in Table II following EMI20.1 EMI20.2 tb SEP Compound SEP Fungicidal SEP Activity tb Example SEP RÚ SEP R SEP Pva SEP Pvt SEP Pvp SEP P1 SEP Ln tb SEP 1 SEP CH3 3C SEP H SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 2 SEP CH3 3C SEP Na SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 3 SEP phenyl SEP H SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 4 SEP phenyl SEP Na SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 5 SEP benzyl SEP H SEP 1 SEP 2 tb SEP 6 SEP SEP CH3CH2 CH3 2C SEP SEP H SEP SEP 2 SEP SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 7 SEP p nitrophenyl SEP H SEP 2 tb SEP amino SEP tb SEP 8 SEP methylamino SEP t butyl SEP 1 SEP 2 tb SEP 9 SEP methylamino SEP H SEP 1 SEP 1 tb SEP 10 SEP SEP cyclohexylamino H SEP SEP SEP SEP 1 tb SEP 11 SEP ethoxycarbonyl SEP B SEP 1 SEP 1 tb SEP rethylamino SEP tb SEP 12 SEP H SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 13 SEP phenylamino SEP H SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 14 SEP SEP 2 chlorophenyl H SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP SEP 2 tb SEP amino SEP tb SEP 15 SEP CH3 3C SEP NH3 SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP CH CH3 2 tb SEP 16 SEP CH3 2C SEP benzyl SEP 1 SEP 2 tb SEP 17 SEP cyclohexyl SEP H SEP 2 SEP 1 tb SEP 18 SEP 2,4,Etri SEP H tb SEP methylphenyl tb SEP 19 SEP CH3 CH2 10 SEP H SEP 2 SEP 2 tb SEP 20 SEP CH3 CH2 14 SEP H SEP 1 SEP 2 tb SEP 21 SEP CH3 CH2 16 SEP H SEP 2 tb SEP 22 SEP CH3CH2 2 SEP H SEP 2 tb continued....EMI21.1 tb SEP Compound SEP Fungicidal SEP Activity tb SEP ample SEP RÚ SEP R SEP Pva SEP Pvt SEP Pvp SEP Pl SEP Ln tb 23 SEP C2H5O.CO.
