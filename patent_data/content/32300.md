## Description
This invention relates to a fluid system for controlling the operating functions of a motor device, such as an actuator. In particular, but not exclusively, the invention is concerned with the provision of an improved hydraulic system for controlling the operating functions of the movable memberof an actuator, for example, the piston of a double acting cylinder and piston unit. An object of the invention is to provide a fluid control system which includes a bi rotational pump connected with the opposite ends of the cylinder of an actuator device so as to move the piston therein in one or the other direction in the cylinder depending on the selected direction of rotation of the pump. A further more specific object of the invention is to provide valving in the fluid control circuits so as to prevent back pressure from the cylinder driving the pump in the event of the application of an outside force to the piston rod. A still further object of the invention is to provide means for avoiding a hydraulic lock situation in the event that the output pressure from the pump drops below the back pressure fom the cylinder of the actuator device. In its broadest aspect the invention provides a fluid system for controlling the operation of an actuator consisting of a cylinder containing a piston movable therein, the opposite ends of said cylinder being connected each with an opposite output of a bi directional pump through a one way pressure check valve preventing return flow of fluid from said one cylinder end to said pump, said system being further characterised in that each end of said cylinder is furthermore connected to a fluid reservoir through a check valve which is normally open to permit flow of fluid from said cylinder end to said reservoir but which is adapted to close in response to a predetermined increase in pressure between the corresponding pump output and its one way pressure check valve. piston rod R is slidably movable in a double acting cylinder B, the ends of which are provided with ports B B2 for the connection thereto of the hydraulic control system of the invention. The piston rod R extends from one end of the cylinder B and is connected to a device to be actuated such as a valve. The hydraulic control system comprises a pump C which is a bi directional rotary gear pump with a high leakage rate across the gears.The pump is preferably rotated manually, but may be motor driven. The port B1 at one end of the cylinder B is connected with one outputC1 of the pump C by a hydraulic line which includes a normally closed one way pressure check valve D1. The valve D1 is a relatively high crack pressure check valve operable, for example, at a pressure of about 401bs. per square inch. The hydraulic line between the port B1 and check valve D1 may further include a flow control valve A1 which is adjustable to vary In the preferred embodiment of the invention the actuator is a double acting, hydraulically operated cylinder and piston unit and flow control valves may be located in the circuit lines to the cylinder so as to provide a speed control for the movement of the piston. In order that the invention may be clearly understood the preferred embodiment will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representat ion of a hydraulic control system incorporating the features of the invention and adapted to operate a double acting cylinder and piston unit, and Figure 2 is similar to Figure 1 but showing the control system with a pump operating in one direction so as to move the piston of the piston and cylinder unit. In the drawings a piston P having a draws fluid from the reservoir G through one way check valve F2 which now opens and pressure fluid is then pumped at the output G1 of the pump. The outlet pressure of the fluid from the pump C closes check valve F1 to the reservoir G and when the pressure reaches approximately one half the crack pressure of the check valve D1, the pressure also communicated to valve F1 closes the valve F1 so isolating the corres ponding end of cylinder X from the reservoirG. The valve D1 opens at its rated pressure and the pressure then builds up in the corresponding right hand end of cylinder B. At this time fluid in the left hand end of cylinder B is able to travel freely from the cylinder via port B2 to the reservoir G through the open check valve, so that the piston S will move to the left and retract the piston rod R. The system works in a similar manner to extend the piston rod R from the cylinder the speed of operation of the system, and the line is additionally connected to the reservoir G through a normally open pilot operated check valve E1. The hydraulic line between the pressure check valve D1 and pump output C1 is connected firstly, with the reservoir ommat G through through a one way check valve B11 and secondly, with the check valve E1 on that side of the check valve remote from the reservoir. The hydraulic control system of the invention is completed by similar hydraulic connections and valves between the port B2 at the other end of the cylinder B and the other outlet C2 of the pump, the various valves being given the corresponding reference letters with the suscript 2. The hydraulic system as shown in Figure 1 is in an inoperative position. In Figure 2 the pump has been manually operated to energize the pump C so that it rotates clockwise in the direction of the arrow. The pump C when the pump C is operated in the opposite anti clockwise direction. Speed control of the system may be obtained by adjustment of the flow control valves A1 and A2. In practice the parts of the system indicated by the reference letter G indicates openings to the hydraulic reservoir and the parts of the system shown by the reference letters C to G are all contained within the reservoir in addition to the hydraulic fluid.The shaft of the pump C protrudes through the front of the reservoir as do the ports and the reservoir breather filter. The flow control valves A when required would be mounted to the ports. If an outside force is applied to the piston rod R of the cylinder B thus generating a back pressure, the check valves D1, D2 prevent the fluid from reaching the pump C and thereby driving it as a motor. Manual operation of the pump C in this situation could produce enough pressure in the pilot valve line to keep the pilot operated normally open check valves E E2 in a closed position thus caus g a hydraulic lock. The control system of the invention avoids this problem due to the fact that upon cessation of manual operation of the pump handle, the pressure drop due to leakage across the pump is sufficiently high to cause an instantaneous opening of the pilot operated check valves E1, E2 so that a hydraulic lock is avoided. If desired, the one way check valves and D2 may be each combined as a single, unitary valve structure with its corresponding check valve E1 and E2 In such an arrangement the single valve structure may comprise a ported valve having a valve member which is slidably movable in response to the pump pressure firstly to isolate the reservoir drain line and secondly to open the line between the pump and the corresponding end of the cylinder. Furthermore, the actuator may be of the rotary vane type, the movable piston member in such an arrangement comprising a vane angularly movable in a ouadrant shaped cylinder through an arc of approximately 900.
