# Material for electrodes and electrolytic cells with anodes consisting of this material.

## Abstract
An improved electrode is disclosed for the anode 3 in a sulfur cycle hydrogen generation process where sulfur dioxide is oxidized to form sulfuric acid 2 at the anode 3 . The active compound in the electrode is palladium, palladium oxide, an alloy of palladium, or a mixture there of. The active compound may be deposited on a porous, stable, conductive substrate.
