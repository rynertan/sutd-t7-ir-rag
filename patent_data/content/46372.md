# Roll dispenser.

## Abstract
A roll dispenser 1, preferably one piece having no moving parts, has a rear aperture 8 for insertion of a roll and a front ap erture 7 for extraction of material from the roll. A cutter 2 is provided adjacent to the front aperture 7 and a cling surface 3 close to the cutter ensures proper disposition of the material during the retraction. The dispenser is conveniently made by injection moulding, or by compression moulding in which case it is desirable that the top surface 11 and bottom surface 12 are mutually parallel.
