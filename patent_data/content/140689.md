# HYBRID CELL LINES PRODUCING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST TREPONEMA AND USE THEREOF FOR IMMUNO DIAGNOSIS OF TREPONEMAL INFECTIONS

## Abstract
The present invention provides hybrid cell lines produc ing monoclonal antibodies reactive with the human patho genic treponemes T. pallidum and T. pertenue, but not reactive with the treponemes which are not pathogenic to man. T. hyodysenteriae and T. phagedenis biotype Reiter. Further, there is provided hybrid cell lines which have spe cificity for the immunodominant P6 protein shared by the pathogens T. pallidum and T. pertenue. Diagnostic analysis of the pathogenic treponeme, T. pallidum, from infected tis sue and serum is accomplished using a selected monoclo nal antibody composition, termed 13Fâ‚ƒ.
