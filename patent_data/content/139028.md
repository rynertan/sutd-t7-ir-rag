## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF FARINACEOUS PRODUCTS This invention relates to a new process for the manufacturing of farinaceous products, particularly for the preparation of vermicelli and pastes for cold storage industry. Farinaceous products namely farinaceous foodstuffs obtained by admixing flour, water and optionally eggs and other additives used in theWmanufacturing of pastes, and subsequent kneading, forming and optionally cooking and or drying must comply with a number of requirements. Thus the said pastes must have a short cooking time, a large swelling grade expressed in the amount of water taken up during cooking , should not boil to rags during cooking and the losses occuring during cooking must be small. The paste must have suitable organoleptic properties its shape, form, colour, surface, structure, smell, taste and post cooking s estate must be satisfactory. A further requirement resides is the storability for a long period of time. It is both the interest of the consumers and the pressoiption of the authorities that the farinaceous products pastes should meet the above requirements at a high level. Several attempts were made to improve the quality of pastes. Thus it is necessary to use suitable flour for the manufacturing of pastes. The flour of durum type wheats having a high gluten content proved to be much more advantageous than that of aestivum type wheats.The cultivator of durum type wheat is however limited by wheather, soil and geogrephical factors and for this reason flour required for the manufacturing of fiarinaceous products is either expensive or even not at all available. When grist of aestivum wheat having a low gluten content is used, the protein content of the paste can be increased by the addition of eggs. This method is however accompanied by the drawback that eggs can be the source of infections, particularly of Salmonella infections and for this reason the use of eggs for this purpose is prohibited by the authorities of several countries. One or more properties of paste can be improved with the aid of certain additives. Thus lupine flour Journal ofFood Science 45, 2, 404 405 , pea meal Cereal Chemistry 57, 3, 203 206 , skimmed milk Japanese patent specification o. 5,.49814 or soya meal can be used for this purpose. The said additives improve the cooking characteristics on the paste e,g. the cooking time is shortened .The colour of the paste can be improved by using by products of maize starch production British patent specification No. 1.584.828 . In order to shorten the cooking period sodium hydrogen carbonate and an acid are added Japanese patent specification No. 52.24577 . The general cooking characteristics can be improved by adding sodium algimate, calcium glyconate and pot ash Sowiet patent specification No. 315.913 . The use of the said additives is however restricted by the fact that these preperties are improved to the detriment of other ones, particularly when the additives are used in a large amount. According to an other method, cooking period is shortened and the losses occuring during cooking are reduced by treating the crude paste with vapour or drying the same at a high temperature above 700C US patent specifications Nods, 4.230.735, 4.243.689 and 4.243.690 Swiss patent specification No. 473.538 and, Cereal Industry ffi , 5, 394 1979 and Supplements Alla Gasetta Ufficuale Nr. 254, 30 9 74 . As a result of the said thermal treatment the proteins coagulate and this gives beneficial results. This process is however not competetive on industrial scale because of the high energy demand. The object of the present invention is to provide a process which is suitable for the production of pastes having high quality in spite of the above difficulties.It is a further object of the present invention to enable the manufacturing of sarinaceous products of high quality without using aestivum type wheat grist and or eggs. It has been found that the above object can be achieved by using for the manufacturing of farinaceous products in an amount of 5 40 s by weight preferably 15 25 by weight of a meal comprising such hybrid maize grist which has a starch fraction containing at least 90 preferably 95 of amylopectin. The above recognition is so much the more unaforeseen and surprising as hitherto maize flour was held to be unsuitable for the production of paste. According to prior art EGetreide, Mehl und Brot, Vol 33, II .pages 299 3023 a paste which comprises maize grist does not form a coherent mass during kneading, it is a difficult to be worked up and the farinaceous products prepared therefrom do not comply with the requirements. The vermicelli obtained therefrom easily crumbles, gets broken, the cooked paste is not sufficiently resilient and boils to rags.According to the conclusions drawn from prior art maize grist can orRy be added to the meal of durum wheat and in an amount not higher than 10 , because otherwise the cooking characteritives of the paste are sdversely and unfavourably effected. On subjecting the applicability of maize meal to profound studies it has been found that from the point of view of the quality of the paste the amylopectin content of the starch fraction of maize is of particular signi finance. The said amylopectin content prevents the disig tegration of the starch particles during cooking, and consequently the starch gets not washed out. It has also been found that the hybrid protein structure of maize having a high amylopectin content differs from that of other maize species. Namely in this case the starch patricles are surrounded by the protein to a larger extent and in a more resilient manner. Amylopectin which has a high molecular weight and a cross linked structure plays in the formation of the structure of the paste a similar role as gluten protein and ensures the coherent structure. The amylopectin protein structure which is india pensable and of outstanding importance from the point of view of paste production can however only be formed if a hybrid maize grist is used which comprises a starch fraction containing at least 90 of amylopectin. According to the process of the present invention it is preferred to use in the above mentioned amount maize ground to a particle size generally used in paste production, i.e. to 100 500 microns, preferably to 200 400 microns, particularly to 260 340 microns. The preparation of such grist does not require special equipment or tech ocilogy of milling industry. One may proceed preferably by admixing maize grist with wheat flour under dry conditions and subjecting the mixture to usual technological steps the flour is admixed with water and optionally with eggs, egg powder or egg fluid, respectively and to the mass the optional additives are added. As additives e.g. phosphates or carbonates can be used which shorten the cooking period or vitamins or sodium chloride can be applied. The mass is kneaded in a suitable kedging machine, then shaped to the desired from e.g. it is extruded to a macaroni and if vermicelli is to be prepared it is dried. According to the process of the present invention high temperature drying is eliminated. This step is however necessary if pastes of some specific quality are to be prepared. A preferable form of realization of the process of the present invention is described below Wheat meal flour is admixed with maize grist and from the mixture thus obtained a mass containing about 30 of water is prepared by adding warm water 70 C . The mass is headed homogenous and formed on a paste press at a temperature of about 400C, The crude paste is dried in an air conditioned box at 75 800C, A paste which can be preserved by deep freezing is obtained in an analogous manner. In this case the water content of the mass is adjusted to about 40 50 and the crude paste obtained after forming is not dried but cooked at a temperature of 90 100 C for about 5 minutes, The producttfius obtained is packed and preserved by deep freezing.The paste prepared by the above process has a nice yellow colour and possesses outstanding properties. It can be cooked within a short period of time and the cooked paste is resilient and not sticky.The advantage of the present invention is that it provide a simple and economics, procees for the productions of farinaceous products of outstanding quality. According to the present invention starting from aestivum wheat grist and without the use of eggs a paste of such quality can be prepared which could be obtained by known methods only from the grist of durum wheat or by using eggs, respectively. The cooking time of the paste prepared by the process of the present invention is shorter than that of the product obtained by conventional methods and therefore the energy demand of the this paste is lower.The present invention eliminates the use of eggs and this leads to the production of farinaceous products which can be stored for a long period of time and do not give rise to Salmonella infections. The cold storage paste products prepared according to the present invention can be readily and conveniently stored by deep freezing. The other properties of the products obtained by the process of the present invention are excellent too as it is demonstrapd by the comparative expertiments disclosed in the Examples. Further details of the process are illuetrated by the following Examples vithout limiting the scope of prctection to the said Examples. Example 1 85 kg of aestivum wheat grist are admixed with 15 kg of waxy Yvc rid maize grist, the starch fraction thereof containing 99 ,e of amylopectin. To the dry product warm water 700C is added and the mixture is kneaded in aZ armed mixer for 10 minutes, The mass is kneaded homogenous, whereupon it is shaped in a Pavanti type paste press at 40 C under a pressure of 120 kg cm2. The crude paste thus obtained is dried at 7500. The paste thus obtained has a nice yellow colour and can be stored without any deterioration for at least a year.Example 2One prdceeds according to Example 1 except that a mixture of 80 mg of aestivum wheat grist and 20 kg of waxy hybrid maize grist is used. The paste thus obtained is similar to that prepared by Example 1, it has a somewhat yellower colour and can be stored for an equally long period of time,Example 3One proceeds according to Example 1 except that 75 kg of aestivum wheat grist and 25 kg of waxy hybrid maize grist is used, The paste thus obtained has a yellow colour and is well storable.Example 4 70 kg of aestivum wheat grist are admixed with 15 kg of durum wheat grist and 15 kg of waxy hybrid maize grist.The mixture is worked up a described in Example 1.The paste thus obtained is of a brownish yellow colour and storable. example 5 85 kg of aestivum wheat grist are admixed with 15 kg of waxy hybrid maize grist. The nature is worked up as described in Example 1 except that an amount of eggs powder cresponding to 20 eggs is added to the mass prior to homogenisation.Example 6 75 kg of aestivum wheat grist are admixed with 25 kg of waxy hybrid maize grist. The mixture is worked up as described in Example 1 except that an amount of egg fluid corresponding to 40 eggs is added to the mass prior to homogenization, The characteristic properties of the pastes prepared according to the above Examples are determined and compared to those of products are prepared without the addition of maize grist or by using normal maize grist, respectively, starting from aestivum or durum wheat grist, respectively, in the presence or absence of eggs, respectively, The reference pastes serving as comparison are prepared by the process according to Example 1 from the corresponding starting materials.The starch fraction of normal maize flour contains 75 a of amylopectin. The tests are carried out and the results evaluated according to the corresponding Rungarian standarde Nos. 11919 78, 17673 79, 20500 1 72, 20500 2 80 and 20500 3 79, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 1. In the Table the pastes are characterized by the total number of points of the organoleptic tests which is the sum of the number of points of the following four tests external appearance maximal number of points 40 smell Imaximal number of points 10 taste naximal number of points 20 estate of the cooked paste maximal number of points 30 . The interval of the number of points of the organoleptic properties is disclosed, too.

Thus the cooking time of the paste prepared according to the present invention is shorter than that of conventional pastes and consequently they can be cooked with a smaller energy demand, The swelling capacity of the pastes according to the present invention reaches or exceeds that of conventional pastes. A further advantage of the process of the present invention is that the damages and losses occuring during cooking are significantly smaller. The highest improvement of the process of the present invention resides in the organoleptic properties and the external appearence of the paste. It is also of great importance that starting from aestivum wheat grist being less suItable for paste production or omitting the eggs, respectively, farinaceous products of such high quality can be obtained which ould be hitherto prepared only when durum wheat grist, was used as starting material or eggs were added to the mixture.
