# Synthetic fiber surface modification process.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for surface modifying shaped essentially synthetic fiber articles so as to impart to them stain release properties that endure through many launder ings. The process subjects the article to a water dispellable non crystalline polymeric polyester compound containing sulfonic acid groups and a water soluble salt of a metal of the groups IA, IIA, VIB and VIIB of the periodic Table, and A1. in an aqueous swelling environment. Also disclosed are an aqueous treating bath for providing the stain releasing finish of the present invention and shaped essentially synthetic fiber articles treated by the process of the present invention.
