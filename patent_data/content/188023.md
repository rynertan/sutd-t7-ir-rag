# A method of exposing a light sensitive layer and exposure device.

## Abstract
Method and exposure device for exposing a movable light sensitive layer, the exposure device comprising a straight array of LED s 24 27 for the line wise exposure of the light sensitive layer, the array extending perpendicularly to the direction of movement of said light sensitive layer, means 10, 11, 15 for energizing each individual LED in the array per image line for a variable time corresponding to corrected image signals, a circuit 20 23,30 being provided which can energize each individual LED in the array per image line symmetrically with respect to an imaginary line extending parallel to said array.
