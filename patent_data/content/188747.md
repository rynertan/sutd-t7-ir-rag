## Description
The present invention relates to caps made of composite material for personal protection, such as helmets and the like, and more particularly to a composite helmets provided with high characteristics of resistance to the absorption of impact energy and to the dynamic to penetration by hard bodies, such as projectiles, splinters and the like. It is known that ballistic protective helmets hereinunder also simply denominated as helmets are constituted by steel or other metal material. Such helmets have a limit of ballistic protection V₅₀ of the order of magnitude of 1000 1200 feet s i.e., of about 305 366 m s , wherein V₅₀ is the average of speeds measured for 10 impacts projectile caliber 0.22, type 2 , comprising the five lowest speeds for which the complete projectile penetration occurs, and the five highest speeds for which a partial penetration of projectile occurs, according to known MIL STD 662B 1971 and MIL P 46593A ORD 1962 U.S.A. standards, to which standards reference shall be made in the following disclosure when reference to ballistic characteristics and tests shall be made. It is known that metal helmets show the drawback of being heavy relatively to their ballistic characteristics , as well as of being good heat conductors, hence discomfortable when same helmets are to be borne over long time periods in very hot or very cold places. Head coverings and helmets also exist and are known made of composite material, generally constituted by fiberglass or of polyamide type fabric, impregnated with a suitable resin, such as e.g. phenolic resins, thermosetting polyester resins, and others. FR A 1,113,396 discloses, e.g., a composite product useable for protective helmets too constituted by an assembly or laminate of a plurality of sheets of fibrous matrial fiberglass impregnated with a synthetic resin polyester , said sheets being linked to each other in a few contact points or areas, only, and wherein some of said sheets may be not resin impregnated. U.S. A 3,018,210 discloses in its turn a composite helmet it too of non metal materials substantially having a sandwich structure, wherein two shells, respectively an inner and an outer shell, are both rigid by being constituted by a resin impregnated fibrous material , whilst an intermediate layer, comprised between said two shells, is constituted by a flexible not resin impregnated ballistic fabric, wherein said layer is mostly free of moving between said outer and inner shells, which shells are solidly linked to each other by means of suitable linking means. FR A 2,425,046 discloses a composite material for the personal protecon such as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and provided with high characteristics of resistance to the absorption of impact energy and to the dynamic penetration by hard bodies, comprising, in combination, an outer shell constituted by a metal material superimposed to an inner shell constituted by a composite laminate consisting of aromatic polyamide fibers impregnated with a synthetic resin, whereinsaid two shells are solidly linked to each other by means of polymeric material interposed between the said shells. The composite material disclosed in this reference is characterized by a high total areal density and, therefore, it is not suitable for being used in the manufacture of caps such as helmets. More recently, non metal helmets have been developed, essentially constituted by fibers with high physical me chanical characteristics in particular, aramidic fibers, i.e., highly aromatic polyamide fibers , suitably woven, and assembled with synthetic resins. Said helmets are however very expensive, and moreover have ballistic properties such as those hereinabove defined around 2000 feet s about 610 m s . Particular object of the present invention is hence to provide an improved composite ballistic helmet, not showing the above said drawbacks of the known art, and which is moreover provided with great resistance to the absorption of impact energy, as well as of greater resistance to penetration by projectiles, splinters, and the like. Another object of the invention is to provide improved composite protective helmets for the most various uses, such as, e.g., helmets for miners, for operators of industrial plants, for firemen, for parachutists and the like. According to the present invention, these and still other purposes, which shall be clear for those skilled in the art from the following detailed disclosure, are achieved by a cap of composite material for the personal protection, particularly a composi te helmet, provided with high characteristics of resistance to the absorption of impact energy and to the dynamic penetration by hard bodies, comprising, in combination, an outer shell constituted by a metal material superimposed to an inner shell constituted by a composite laminate consisting of aromatic polyamide fibers impregnated with a synthetic resin, wherein said two shells are solidly linked to each other by means of polymeric material interposed between the said shells, characterized in that the inner shell is constituted by fabrics made of aromatic polyamide fibers impregnated with a resin wherein said resin forms an elastic matrix with alveolar structure, the aromatic polyamide fiber of the fabrics being arranged into the alveoli of the alveolar structure. Said outer metal shell is accomplished, according to the invention, by preferably using known steels for ballistic protective helmets, or deep drawable aluminium alloys for ballistic use, whilst the fibrous matrial of said inner shell is preferably constituted by fabrics of fibers having high physical mechanical characteristics, in particular polyamide fibers, fiberglass, and the like the term polyamide fibers is intended to comprise also the polyamide fibers of aromatic type known as aramide fibers . The above said outer metal shell has as its main function the absorbing and dissipating of the most of the impact energy of a projectile or of a splinter or the like, violently striking the same shell the intermediate layer of polymeric material as above said besides acting as the bonding agent between the two above said respectively outer and inner shells , cooperates with outer shell in absorbing and dissipating said impact energy, by delamination from the shell itself finally, the inner shell as already indicated above has the function of absorbing the residual impact energy of the projectile or the like, by inner delamination, and moreover distributing said residual energy on a large surface, said shell being suitable as a function of the type of fibrous material and of related impregnating resin selected to embody the invention to delaminate, as well as to make said projectile to move along a trajectory not rectilineal, but tortuous hence long , hence suitable to absorb much energy and to confer high resistance to penetration by the projectile. The manufacturing of head coverings and helmets according to the invention is carried out by means of techniques of type known to those skilled in the art, such as cutting, deep drawing, moulding, lamination, polymerization, and the like. It results evident from the above a complex and very efficacious action of resistance to impact and penetration by hard bodies in particular, by projectiles of the various components of composite helmet according to the invention, said action resulting of synergistic type, and however greater than that offered by a comparable helmet of known art, as it shall result more clearly from the Examples disclosed hereinunder. A preferred, but not exclusive embodiment of the invention envisages that inner shell be constituted by the known aramide ballistic fabrics provided with exceptionally high characteristics of tensile strength , and namely, in practice, e.g. by fabrics of Kevlar yarn Trade mark of aromatic polyamide fiber by Du Pont de Nemours, E.I. Co., U.S.A. , said fabrics being in a number of from 10 to about 15, and forming a thickness of about 4 6 mm, same fabrics being solidy assembled with each other by impregnation with a thermoplastic resin, e.g., polyethylene, or with a thermosetting resin, e.g., resins of modified phenol formaldehyde type, vinyl esters, and polyesters. The amount of resin represents about 15 35 by weight, as dry solid matter of the total of material constituting said inner shell fibers resin . Always according to the said preferred embodiment, the layer of polymeric material interposed between the said outer and inner layers is constituted by a cellulose web of about 12 g m², bonded with thermally melting adhesive on the basis of SIS styrene isoprene styrene copolymer. Said layer can also be constituted by the same resin used to impregnate the inner layer. Other types of resin of known type which can be advantageously used are modified melamine resins, polyester resins, vinyl resins, olefinic polymers and copolymers, as well as other known thermosetting resins and thermoplastic polymers. The said intermediate layer of polymeric material interposed between said two shells can be accomplished, according to the invention, both as continuous layer a cap, in particular a helmet, of monolithic structure , being thus formed , as well as in other forms, as, e.g., a foam, a honeycomb structure, and the like, in that case a cap being formed with so called sandwich structure . According to another embodiment, the invention envisages that inner shell be constituted by polyethylene sheets alternated to aramidic fiber fabrics, the polyethylene sheets forming by partial bonding with each other through the interstices of said fabrics an elastic matrix with alveolar structure, with function of tridimensional support, into the alveoli of which the filaments of aramidic fabrics are contained, freely encapsulated see European Patent Application N 0049014 A2, published , said polyethylene sheets and said fabrics being assembled with each other in the said alveolar mode by high temperature pressing e.g., under a pressure of about 5 kg cm² at a temperature of about 165 C, and over a time of baout 15 minutes . The alveolar structure as above said reacts elastically to projectile impact, as the filaments of aramidic fabrics cooperate harmonically in a very efficacious way in the impact area and in its surroundings, slightly sliding by controlled delamination inside related alveoli, when said polyethylene alveolar structure is elastically deformed by the projectile. The following Examples of invention embodiments, given to illustrative only and not limitative purposes, shall serve to better illustrate the same invention.
