# IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF ENERGISING DISC BRAKES

## Abstract
The efficiency of disc brakes of the spreading type is improved by providing angularly spaced pilots 40, 41 on only one of the two pressure plates 5, 6 , or by eliminating the engagement between the pilot on the arrested plate 6 and the pilot lug 51 which would normally take the reaction on the plates for a normal direction of rotation.
