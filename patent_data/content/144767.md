# Polymer compositions.

## Abstract
Vulcanizable rubbery compositions, and a process for their production, comprise a polyamide, a synthetic rubbery polymer comprising meth acrylonitrile, α, β unsaturated carboxylic acid and butadiene and as non polymeric addi tives a halide of lithium, magnesium, calcium or zinc and as oxide a hydroxide of magnesium, calcium, barium or zinc or a peroxide of calcium or zinc and sulphur vulcanization active agents.
