# Vehicle, more particularly agricultural machine comprising ground engaging wheels or an implement resiliently suspended to the frame.

## Abstract
A vehicle, more particularly, an agricultural machine comprising a frame 1 , at least one ground wheel 9 and an implement 2 , said wheel 9 or said implement 2 being suspended by means of springs 12 to the frame 1 , said frame having a drawbar 6 pivotable about a vertical axis for attachment to a tractor 7 or the like and comprising means for detecting the angle between the drawbar 6 and the frame 1 , wherein each ground wheel 9 or implement 2 is suspended by means of a gas spring 99 to the frame 1 , in which spring 99 the prevailing gas pressure may differ from the gas pressure prevailing in a further spring 99 , said gas springs preferably communicating with said hydraulic springs 12 , so when setting the the gas springs separately by said detecting means with a given spring pressure, a constant ground pressure along the width of the implement can yet be maintained for even a fouled agricultural machine drawn or propelled in an inclined position or not.
