# Lock mechanism for tape protective closure for magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape cassette 1 is provided with a pivotal closure lid 8 pivotably secured to both sides of a casing for movement between a closed position, in which the front opening of the casing, through which a magnetic tape is accessible for loading onto a rotary head, is covered, and an open position wherein the closure lid 8 is pivoted away from said opening to expose the tape while the cassette 1 is in use. The magnetic tape cassette 1 is also provided with a sliding closure member 9 slidably mounted on the bottom of the casing and cooperative with the aforementioned pivotal closure lid 8 . The sliding closure member 9 is in a closed position while the pivotal closure lid 8 is in its closed position, in which it covers a bottom clearance 3a through which a device constituting part of a tape holding system is inserted, and in an open position while the pivotal closure lid 8 is in its open position to allow the aforementioned device of the tape handling system to reach into the casing through the bottom clearance. A locking level 15 holds the sliding closure 9 in the current one of its two positions. The sliding closure 9 holds the pivotal closure closed while in its own close position.
