# Composite material packages and method of producing such packages.

## Abstract
The invention relates to materials and method for forming composite packages comprising a first flexible material 11 and a second relatively rigid material 12 which are connected together without the use of additional connecting materials. The connection is achieved by causing the flexible material 11 to be deformed to cooperate in tension with interrupted zones 19 of the relatively rigid material 12 . Many different packages may be formed for a variety of uses but the invention is particularly suitable for connecting a heat shrinkable plastics body part to a paperboard or like sheet material end part.
