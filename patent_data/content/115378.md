# MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR SELENIUM PHOTORECEPTORS

## Abstract
A vapor deposition apparatus including a vacuum chamber 12 , a vacuum pump 14 for evacuating the chamber, and a mounting assembly 15 disposed within the chamber and adapted to support and electrically isolate a plurality of substrate electrode units 17 to be coated. Electrical couplings 51 connect the electrode units 17 to a power supply 52 that establishes therebetween potential gradients that produce a glow discharge and resultant heating thereof. Also disposed within the vacuum chamber is a source of evaporative coating 19 for deposition on the glow discharge heated electrode units 17 .
