# Semiconductor device for memory cell.

## Abstract
An ROM memory cell CB, CA having a characteristic corresponding to the data value 1 or 0 , to be stored therein. The correspondence of characteristic to 1 or 0 data values being achieved by selection of the conductivity type of at least a portion 13c of a semiconductor layer 13 in the memory cell structure.
