# Image forming particles.

## Abstract
The disclosure is directed to light transmitting image forming particles each containing at least a colorless sublim ing dye which develops color through reaction with a color developing agent, and also a coloring agent, and moreover, having at least a pair of parallel faces. When applied to a particular image forming process as disclosed, the particles can provide color images with an expanded latitude and a superior color purity, while, by bevelling or planing off the edges defining the parallel faces, exposure amount may be reduced as compared with particles without such bevelling.
