# Method and apparatus for analysis of torque applied to a joint.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for continu ously monitoring the making up a joint between two mutually engageable threaded members 12, 13, 14, 22, 23 , the threaded members having co operating shoulder seal elements 18, 19, 20, 21 . The invention involves the application of torque to the mutually engaging members and detecting when a shoulder engaging position has been reached. A predetermined additional torque is then applied if a good joint is indicated as being achievable. If a good joint is indicated as not being achievable, the application of additional torque is terminated.
