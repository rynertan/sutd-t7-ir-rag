## Description
ADHESIVE FREE LAMINATING METHODS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to methods of laminating film materials which are useful, inter alia, as packaging material. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel means of detackifying and retackifying an incompletely cured film to render such film rollable, and then retackifying the film to render the film laminatable to a second film. In the prior art, for many applications, it has ben necessary to utilize films havinq barrier char acteristics which are different for the inside of a package as opposed to the outside of the package which is exposed to the atmosphere. In addition, on certain forms of plastic which are desirable for packaging purposes, the exposed surface has been found to be undesirable for printiny characteristics. In such instances, it has been necessary to utilize a lamination of two or more plies of polyneric films to forn a laminate which is then formed into the packaging material. This has been especially necessary for food products. In the prior art, in order to formulate such laminated plastic material, it has been necessary to utilize adhesives in between the respective plies or layers of the laminate. Alternatively, it has been necessary for the services of a laminating converter to be utilized. Such a converter purchasers the needed films, and florins the needed lanination, frequently on a custom basis, for the package rnanufacturr. These necessary services have increased the cost of such packaging material, both by reason of the necessity of utilizing adhesives, and also by reason of additional shipping and necessary treatnents. In view of these and other material deficiencies of prior art methods and techniques, it is a material object of the laminating method of the present invention to alleviate such deficiencies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The laminating method of the present invention is utilized for producing a multiple layered packaging laminate from at least two films without the use of adhesive. The laminating method of the present invention comprises the steps of providing a first film which is less than completely cured, and detackifying the sticky top and bottom surfaces thereof such that the film may be rolled. Later and at the time of lamination, the detackified layer is retackified in preferred embodiments, preferably as it is unrolled whereupon, it is laminated to a second film. The second film may also be detackified and retackified in alternative preferred embodiments. The film may be preferably detackified by vapor deposition or by cold plasma in an oxidizing atmosphere, or by the deposition of vapor of a paraffin material, or by vapor of a silicon material in other alternative embodiments. The surface may be substantially retackified i.e., reconverted to a tacky surface by applying electromagnetic energy, preferably inan inert atmosphere, such as by means of a coronal discharge or by cold plasma techniques. The methods of the present invention may be better understood in conjunction with the attached drawing, detailed description of preferred embodiments, and the appended claims. Several examples of the laminating method of the present invention are described herein and the following description is meant to be illustrative, and not limited to the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention. All of the various embodiments in which this invention may be practiced are not described however, other forms of laminated methods within the scope of the present invention will be suggested thereby to those of ordinary skill in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The description is made in reference to the accompanying drawings, and wherein FIG. 1 is a schematic view of the production of a first film of a polymeric material exiting from the extruder and being treated while still only partially cured by a detackifying means to detackify the surface thereof, such that it may be stored upon a roll without sticking FIG. 2 depicts a schematic view of the method of the present invention depicting the roll of the detackified first film material, which is then retackified prior to being laminated together with a second film material, the proto laminate may then be heated to complete the laminate fusing, and finally the laminated material is stored on a further roller for subsequent use and FIG. 3 is an enlarged schematic cross sectional representation of a two ply laminated film taken along line 3 3 of FIG. 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The laminating methods of the present invention produce a multiple layered packaging laminate from at least two films without the utilization of separate adhesives therebetween. The methods comprise in general the steps of providing a first film which is less than completely cured. The such first film is then detackified at the top and bottom surfaces thereof without any substantial curing of the interior of such first film to permit it thereby to be stored upon a roller without sticking together. Next, the first film is stored upon a roll. Thereafter such film is unrolled, and the detackified surface is retackified on at least one surface thereof. A second film is provided, and the first and second films are laminated together. The first film is preferably cured during such lamination. The second film may be a film which is also less than completely cured, and in which the surface thereof may be detackified. The second film also is stored on a roll, and the surface thereof may also be retackified in preferred embodiments. Under such embodiments, the second film is then laminated to the first film, and the two films may be preferably heat treated to form such laminate. The film materials of the present invention are preferably polymeric materials, which may be selected from a wide variety of polymers, including inter alia polyolefins, nylon, polyethylene teraphtalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, polystyrenes, poly vinylidene chloride, and other suitable polymers. Polymers containing ethyl acetate on the surface thereof are especially useful, as the ethyl radical created by the plasma techniques is readily connected, linked into a polymer chain of a suitable hydrocarbon creating crosslinking bonding between the two surfaces. Such films may also contain a sufficient amount of unreacted monomer to render said films substantially stickable to other films by means of producing crosslinking between two surfaces tacky surface thereon. In some preferred embodiments, the first film is a thermoplastic material, and may have in these and other embodiments a relatively low melting point. The surface of such films may be detackified by applying a release or foreign agent thereto. Such release agent may be applied by means of an electrostatic coating or by spraying. Such release agent may be preferably less than 1 micron thick. The release agent may be a paraffin or a silicon material, of such chemical composition that it will readily react with highly re active particles of oimized gas. Also, such surfaces may be detackified by means of oxidation thereof. Such detackification techniques may be by vapbr deposition or by cold plasma techniques. In such instances, the vapor of a paraffin material or a silicon material or others may be deposited. The surface may be retackified to a substantially tacky surface condition by means of the application of electromagnetic energy thereto, and preferably in the presence of an inert atmosphere. Such electromagnetic energy may be by means of coronal discharge.Cold plasma techniques, also in such inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon, helium, xenon, crypton, neon, or others may be utilized. Retackification is accomplished by two plasma mechanisms a cleaning the surface and b creating free radicals.The iodized active particles of plasma remove the release agent or anti block agent introduced on the surface of the polymer for detackification and rolling purposes. Thereafter, the plasma ionization promotes the crosslinking of polymers by creating free radicals. The radiation knocks off a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbonic chain, and when such free radical finds another atom that can replace the hydrogen, it links into the chain creating a bond with the other sheet. The free radical then promotes the crosslinking between the two appropriately selected surfaces without the use of any adhesive, fusion, etc. Apparatus suitable for carrying out of the method of the present invention is preferably a selfcontained unit to produce such laminated films, continuously and automatically. Such apparatus may be in preferred embodiments coupled to a packaging line to produce film on demand as the packaging machine requires. When used independently, such laminating machine would preferably be equipped with a rewind stand for laminating rolls. In other embodiments, the apparatus of the present invention may function as add on equipment with an existing packaging Line or independently as a self standing film laminator. In regard to the films for use in the present methods, the sheets may be either clear or pigmented, random or registered printed, or in other embodiments metalized polymeric materials. The barrier characteristics of the materials can vary form very low barrier structures, through materials displaying very high barrier characteristics, such as those displayed by metalized Saran and Barex, and foam or expanded structures. The high barrier materials produced according to the methods of the present invention may be used for packaging perishable foods, drugs or other products that require high degrees of isolation of the packaged product from the environment. Also, the materials that are used in the laminating invention of the present invention in preferred embodiments have the required FDA andUSDA approvals for those products which are to be used to package food, drug or cosmetic products. The inks utilized for decorating and labeling purposes may be contained between the two film plies in preferred embodiments, which would greatly reduce the need for special surface treatment of the laminate and also for special inks for that purpose. Also, the ink locked between the two plies of the lamination will enhance the appearance and durability of the packaging. When utilized in conjunction with a packaging line the apparatus for carrying out the laminating methods of the present invention should be preferably equipped with an electronic print register system, as are known in the art. Such a system is designed to produce a pre printed semi rigid sheet which is fed to register with a thermoforming unit or other package forming machine. Such apparatus for carrying out the methods of the present invention includes at least elements for unwinding the film, treating the film surface, laminating the two films, and a rewind stand for rewinding the laminate. An unwind stand is also provided to accomodate two rolls of film. In certain preferred embodiments, three plies may be laminated together, such as for packaging bulk product, and which will be especially useful for packaging bulk product for institutional use. In certain applications, all three plies are designed to withstand temperatures for cooking food in the package. The utilization of high temperature film will permit the foods to be cooked inside the container. This will also insure sterility of contents of the package. As a result, the product packaged in such a packaged can be expected to remain fresh over a long period of time without the need for refrigerator storage. The economic impact is that great savings may be obtained by the users of such methods of the present invention. Referriny now to the drawing, and to Fig. 1 in particular, a first plastic film generally 10 is formed from an extruder 12 in a less and completely cured state. Such first film 10 from extruder 12 may be treated, preferably at both surfaces 14,16 thereof, by detackifying treatment means 18, such as a vapor depositor or coronal discharge unit or by other means to detackify the surface. The treated film generally 20 is then wound in the direction of arrow A onto a winding first film roller 22 to form a roll 24 of detackified film. With respect to Fig. 2, the roll 24 of the detackified first film 20 is unwound and passed over a retackifying element 26, which may be by coronal discharge or cold plasma treatment. An inert atmosphere may preferably be provided therefor. At the same time, a second roll 28 of a different polymeric material generally 30 is unwound from a second film roller 32, and the first and second rolls 24,28 are passed through nip roller 34,36 pressing the two films 20,30 together to form a laminate generally 40. Such nip rollers 34,36 may be heated. In alternative preferred embodiments, a heating element 42 may be provided to further cure any uncured portion of the first and second films 20,30 and or to assist in the bonding function of the laminate 40 of first and second films 20,30 as shown in Fig. 3. The laminated and or heated film 40 is then wound in the direction of arrow B to form a roll 44 of laminate 40 on storage roller 46. The invention set forth hereinabove is intended to encompass other specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or the essential characteristics of the present invention. The above embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as being illustrative and not restrictive in any manner of the scope of the present invention, which scope is supplemented by the dependent claims, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.
