# Brake disk and keyslot reinforcements therefor.

## Abstract
A friction brake disk 12 is formed having a plurality of T shaped slots 14 extending through a peripheral edge 16 thereof from one braking face surface 12a to the other 12b and each slot 14 carries a keyslot reinforcement 18 com prised of a metallic insert member 2 having the same T shaped configuration such as to be easily inserted in the slot 14 in the axial direction of the disk but restrained from being removed in the radial direction. Each insert member 2 is locked within the slot 14 in the axial direction by at least one retaining clip 3 that is fastened to the insert member 2 and extends beyond the slot 14 into the face surfaces 12a and 12b of the disk.
