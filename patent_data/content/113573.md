# System and method for producing products from a mix of reclaimed plastic material and virgin plastic resin.

## Abstract
A system and a method for the production of thermo formable plastic foam material from a mix of plastic foam selvage and a foamable virgin plastic resin. Accordingly, the present invention provides for a selvage formed during the production of thermoformed foam material articles from a plastic foam sheet stock is recycled and admixed with the virgin foamable plastic resin, in that the material compo nents are admixed in a feed hopper and then conducted from the feed hopper into a twin screw compressor which will impart a positive forward feed to the compressible plastic materials conveyed therethrough.
