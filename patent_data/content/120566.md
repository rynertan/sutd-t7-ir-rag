# Vertical louvre blind and parts therefor.

## Abstract
A vertical louvre blind has several identical travellers 16 , an end one of which is moved by a pull cord 100 , inserted between two fingers 90 . This traveller pulls the other travel lers by means of a ball chain 98 inserted between the fingers and into a slot 96 . A tilt rod 14 rotates a worm 18 in each traveller, the worm engaging a wormwheel which can readily be pushed into the housing of the traveller. The wormwheel carried a hook 80 on which is mounted a louvre hanger. The louvre hangers each consist of two bars 30 and 34 , the louvre material 22 being folded over to form a hem which can be clamped between the two bars by moving them trans verse to their length. It is possible with the blind to have an easy modification of a stock blind to fit windows of several sizes.
