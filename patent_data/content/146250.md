# SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE

## Abstract
A data processing system for processing encoded control points representing graphical illustrations, comprises a number of separate micro programmed circuit cards, each of which are programmed to perform a specific processing operation. A command is first sent to a matrix maker card 201 defining a geometrical transformation to be performed on the graphical illustration. This card, thogehter with a matrix multiplier card 202 , then calculates a transformation matrix representing the desired transformation. Electronic representations of control data points are then transmitted to the pipeline for processing and multiplied by the transformation matrix, computed previously, in a vector mulitplier circuit card 203 . Next, the control points are clipped to the planes of a viewing frustum by a number of clipper cards 205 209 , one card for each clipping plane. The 3D control points are then mapped onto the 2D viewing window by a viewpoint card 210 . The clipped control points are then exploded to generate a plurality of small line segments representing each of the curved edges of the illustration. Finally, the appropriate portions of the illustration are rendered as a line drawing, in accordance with the code attached to the various control points and the processed data is then converted into a form which is appropriate for scan conversion.
