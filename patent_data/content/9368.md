A pipe coupling comprising a main body including at each end a threaded portion 11 adapted for threaded engagement with an inside coated pipe having a mating externally threaded end portion, an annular groove 12 , an annular projection 13 , said members being located on the inside circumferential surface of said main body 1 in that order from the adjacent open end, a short cylindrical body 2 having one end abutting said annular projection 13 and being mounted within said main body 1 and extending towards the adjacent open end, and an annular packing 3 mounted within the space defined by said threaded portion 11 , said annular groove 12 , said an nular projection 13 and the outer peripheral surface of said cylindrical body 2 . A pipe connection is also provided by threadedly en gaging inside coated pipes 4 with the threaded portions 11 of such a coupling, whereupon the ends of the pipes 4 compress the annular packing 3 into the grooves 12 to act as a seal.
