# Device for prophylaxis and care of tumours, caries and other diseases with notable reduction of pain, by electric and or magnetic pulses.

## Abstract
As a result of in vitro experiments on bacterial cul tures and in vivo experiments, it was verified that with electrical stimuli with a waveform similar or deriving from that of the physiological signals transmitted by nerve fibers, it is possible to reduce even to elimination of the microbial flora present. These electrical stimuli applied in the oral ca vity, reduce even to elimination of germs in the deeper stra tum of the dental caries, with a signal of an amplitude less than the person s threshold of sensitivity to the electrical stimulus and do not cause any undesirable side effects fur ther, they raise the threshold of pain in patients affected with dental neuralgia to almost total disappearance of the neural gia. Further developments show the possibility to apply said electrical and or magnetical stimui or pulses to the prophy laxis and care of tumours, leukemias, sclerosis, diabets and other diseases, and to control the pathological and biological processes on human and living beings.

## Description
Device for prophylaxis and care of tumours,caries and other diseases with notable reduction of pain, by electric and or magnetic pulses.This invention has as its object a device for the prophilaxis and care of tumours,leukemias, sclerosis, diabetes, dental caries and other diseases without causing undesiderable side effects, raising the threshold of pain, and for control the pathological and biological processes on human and living being, by unicellular or pluricellular species, in animal and vegetable kingdom, as well as for retard the cells ageing in cosmetic filed, characterized by suitable equipment to produce electric and or magnetic pulses in wave form similar to, or deriving from, the physiological signals transmitted by the nerve fibers.It was verified,by laboratory experiments,that microorganisms subjected to electrical stimulation with signals generated by the device in question, are neutralized in times of the order of a few minutes depending on the species,By in vivo experiments on teeth affected with penetrating and nonpenetrating caries and subjected to electrical stimulation as above, it was verified that the microbial flora is reduced in times on the order of a few minutes.It is known that electrostimulation causes analgesia which continues when the stimulation ceases.In the present state of the art, electric stimulators are produced only for electroanalgesia.Further, of the stimulators for electroanalgesia produced so far a some, use the extra voltage of a transformer gap, and therefore the signal is of the pulse type, with a high open circuit peak voltage, with a very steep rise and fall front of the signal.b other stimulators for electroanalgesia generate pulses of the rectangular type, even if with a lower peak voltage, and obviously they do not work well for the specified aims.This invention makes it possible, by electric and or magnetic pulses transmitted to the tissues in question, besides raising the threshold of pain, to destroy microorganisms and to reach the aims as cited above.A preferred embodiment of the present invention, relating to the prophilaxis and care of dental caries, will now explained with
