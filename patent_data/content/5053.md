# Flame retardant organic phosphates, their production, and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
This invention relates to flame retardant polymeric alkyl aryl phosphates prepared by Friedel Crafts condensation. The polymeric alkyl aryl phosphates may be made by Friedel Crafts condensation of chloroalkyl aryl phosphates and alkenyl aryl phosphates derived therefrom. Alernatively, the polymeric alkyl aryl phosphates may be made by Friedel Craft condensation of phenols followed by phosphorylation of the Friedel Crafts condensate. The flame retardant polymeric alkyl aryl phosphates of the present invention are particularly suitable for use as an additive, having little or no plasticizing effect in flammable organic plastics.
