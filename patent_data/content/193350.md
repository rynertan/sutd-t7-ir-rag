## Description
The present invention relates to an optical document scanning system and, in particular, to a scanning system driven in a scan rescan direction by a mechanical drive arrangement. Scanning systems employing scan carriages which move parallel to a document platen are well known in the art two examples being disclosed in US A 4,407,581 and 4,029,409. For these scan systems, a document is mounted on a stationary transparent platen support and a group of optical components is mounted on one or more carriages mounted beneath the platen support for parallel movement therewith. These optical components typically include an illumination lamp and mirror on a full rate carriage, and a mirror on a half rate carriage. As these carriages move at their respective rates, a document on the platen is incrementally scan illuminated and an image of the document is projected by a lens onto a photosensitive medium, typically a photoreceptor drum or belt. These prior art scan carriages are driven by a combined mechanical electrical arrangement wherein motion is imparted to the carriage from a main drive shaft It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a drive arrangement for a document scanning system which utilizes solely mechanical components to drive a scanning system in a scan and rescan mode of operation. Accordingly, the present invention provides a scanning apparatus such as is claimed in the appended claims. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to Figure 1, a folded optical scanning system is represented generally at 2 and includes an object surface or platen 4 having an original document 5 placed thereon, and a photosensitive surface in the form of a photoreceptor drum 6. An optical path 8 extends between object surface 4 and drum 6, and is representative of the path of the principal ray of light between the document and the drum. A first reflector 10, illumination lamp assembly 11, a second reflector 12, a reflector projection lens 14 including a lens reflector 16, and a drum reflector 18 are disposed along the optical path 8. The photoreceptor drum 6 is mounted on shaft 19 which is driven at a constant speed by a drive motor not shown . Pulley 20 is fixedly mounted to the outboard end of shaft 19 and rotates therewith for purposes to be described below. Mirrors 10 and 12 are mounted on separate scanning carriages, shown in Figure 2. In operation, mirror 10 moves parallel to the object surface 4 through a given displacement and at a given speed V The various processes for producing an output copy of the exposed original document are well known in the art and hence a detailed description is not herein provided. Briefly however, at station 21 an electrostatic charge is placed uniformly over the surface of the rotating drum 6. The charged drum surface is then moved through an exposure station 22, where the flowing light image of the document 5 is imaged on the drum surface. As a result of this imaging operation, the charge on the drum surface is selectively dissipated in the light exposed region, thereby recording the original input information on the drum surface in the form of an electrostatic latent image. Next, in the direction of drum rotation, the image bearing drum surface is transported through a development station 24 wherein a toner material is applied to the charged surface, thereby rendering the electrostatic latent image visible. The now developed image is brought into contact with a sheet of final support material, such as paper or the like, within a transfer station 26 wherein the toner image is electrostatically attracted from the drum surface to the contacting side of the support sheet. Station 28 represents a mechanism for cleaning toner from the drum surface. A fusing station not shown permanently fixes the transferred image on the support sheet. These xerographic stations and their functions are more fully described in US A 4,318,610. Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a simplified perspective view of the scanning apparatus of Figure 1 and including the drive arrangement of the present invention. Scanning of the stationary original document 5 is accomplished by means of scanning full rate mirror 10, illumination lamp assembly 11, half rate mirror 12 and stationary reflector projection lens 14. Full rate mirror 10 is supported upon a carriage 30 which is slidably mounted on two parallel aligned guide rails, not shown but conventional in the art. Mirror 10, as positioned upon carriage 30, extends transversely beneath the platen 4 surface and in parallel alignment therewith. Mounted directly behind mirror 10 is illumination assembly 11, consisting of an apertured fluorescent lamp 34 and a reflector 35. These illumination components coöperate to illuminate a longitudinally extending, incremental area upon the platen within the viewing domain of mirror 10. As will be explained in greater detail below, carriage 30 is adapted to move parallel to the lower surface of the platen at a constant rate, whereby mirror 10 scans successive illuminated incremental areas on the platen, beginning at a start of scan position position A in Figure 1 and ending at the opposite side of the platen position B in Figure 1 . A second movable carriage 40 is also provided, upon which is supported half rate mirror 12. Carriage 40 is also slidably mounted on guide rails. Mirror 12 is positioned to receive reflected light rays from scanning mirror 10 and to redirect these light rays into lens 14. Lens 14 projects the document image onto drum 6 As illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3, two mechanical drive arrangements according to the invention provide for the scan and rescan motions of carriages 30 and 40. These motions are derived from the rotating xerographic drum 6 Referring now to drive mechanism 70, shown in a side perspective view in Figure 2, and from a top perspective in Figure 3, the movement of scan carriages 30, 40 is derived from the motion of a second drive shaft 72 whose rotational direction is determined by the arrangement of mechanical elements mounted thereon and their operative connection to gear 60 or pulley 62. Mounted on shaft 72 is a clutch hub 74. Hub 74, comprising a first segment 74a, a second segment 74b and a splined segment 74c, is connected to shaft 72 so that it can slide in the indicated X, X direction, but cannot rotate relative to shaft 72. Pulley 76, driven by drive pulley 62 Hub 74a and hub 74b present frictional surfaces to the interfacing surface of pulley 76 and gear 82, respectively. When either hub becomes frictionally engaged, a torque is transmitted from the engaged drive component pulley 76 or gear 82 to clutch hub 74 and, hence, to shaft 72. The angular speed and rotational direction of shaft 72 are therefore, controlled by whichever of the two drive components has been frictionally engaged. At either end of shaft 72 is a scan carriage drive pulley 90, 90 , each pulley driving a belt 92, 92 to which the full rate carriage 30 is attached. Pulley pairs 94, 94 divide the speed in half to drive the half rate carriage 40. Pulleys 96, 96 are for tensioning idler purposes. The mechanism for controlling the X direction movement of hub segments 74a, 74b and hence, the direction and speed of shaft 72, is generally shown as toggle mechanism 100 in Figure 3. Mechanism 100 comprises a first link 102 with projecting ends 102a, 102b which rotate about pivot point 104. Link 102 is connected to a second link 106 and provides a horizontal motion to that link. Link 106 is connected to a third link 108 which rotates about pivot point 110. The motion of link 108 is limited by stops 112, 112 . Toggle spring 114 is connected to link 108 and a fourth link 116 which rotates about pivot point 118. When link 116 rotates clockwise, it will bias hub 74 in the X direction, engaging gear 82. When link 116 rotates counter clockwise, it will bias hub 74 in the X direction, engaging pulley 76. The operation of mechanism 100 can best be understood by reviewing a scan rescan cycle of operation of the scan carriages. Referring to Figures 2 and 3, hub segment 74b is shown in frictional engagement with drive pulley 76. Drive gear 82, not being frictionally engaged, slips on bearings 83. Drive shaft 72 and carriage pulleys 90, 90 , drive belt 92 and attached carriage 30 at a scanning speed V While the drive mechanism embodiment of Figures 1 3 describes a pulley gear arrangement for driving carriages 30 and 40, another mechanical drive arrangement can be used to accomplish the same result. Referring to Figures 4 through 7, there is shown the same basic system as described in Figures 2, 3, except for the substitution of input gears 110, 110 for pulleys 90, 90 , and a rack multiplier gear system generally shown as 112, 112 which replaces the pulley cable arrangement 92, 94, 96. As shown, input gears 110, 110 are fixedly attached to the ends of shaft 72 and rotate therewith at a scan or rescan speed determined by the engagement of either pulley 76 or gear 82, as previously described. Gears 110, 110 mesh with rack surfaces 114, 114 which have been formed on the underside of half rate carriage 40. As gears 110, 110 rotate at a speed w₁, the half rate carriage 40 is driven at a speed w₁r₁ where r₁ is the pitch radius of input gears 110, 110 . Multiplier gears 116, 116 are rotatably connected to the ends of carriage 40. The angular speed w₂ of gears 116, 116 is equal to w₁r₁ r₂, where r₂ is the pitch radius of gears 116, 116 . Gears 116, 116 travel on fixed racks 118, 118 and rack surfaces 120, 120 formed along the bottom edge surfaces of full rate carriage 30. Multiplier gears 116, 116 will therefore drive carriage 30 at a speed of w₁r₁ or twice the half rate speed. Figure 7 shows the rotational speed and radius relationship for gears 110 and 116. As in the initially described pulley operation of Figures 2, 3, the edge 120a of carriage 30 engages the corners of link 102 to reverse the direction and speed of shaft 72 so as to enable the scan and rescan operation. From the above description, it will be appreciated that there has been described a simple, wholly mechanical, drive system for driving a document scanning mechanism. The absence of electrical components, such as the usual clutches and switches to initiate scan and rescan motions, reduces the cost and complexity of the scanning system with single scan carriage. It should also be noted that the mechanism shown in Figure 6 can constitute an alternative embodiment to the two sided drive of Figure 5. While specific scanning systems have been described, various modifications of these systems are possible. For example, while a dual rate scanning system has been shown, the invention is applicable to a single rate scan system. While separate scan and rescan speeds have been described, both speeds can be made equal by appropriate modification to the drive pulley gear ratios shown in Figure 2.
