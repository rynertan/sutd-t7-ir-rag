# Method and apparatus for recording digital signals.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of the arrangement of the error de tection correction code appended to the recording signal for a PCM recorder, that ensures detection and or correction of a dropout or error of the information block address in the play back operation. In recording digital signals on a recording me dium, the recording signal 8 is formatted in n word blocks, each block including a sync signal 4 for providing a reference timing for the playback operation, control signal 5 releated to the digital signal, block address signal 6 for identifying the order of n words, error detection signal 7 for detecting the error in the control signal and block address signal, and error detection correction code 9 used for the error detection and or correction for the n word block. The recording system in cludes an error detection correction code generating circuit 17 which produces error detection correction codes using a Reed Solomon code or b adjacent code. The generated error detection correction codes are collected through a multiplexer 18 so that a recording signal is arranged, and it is recorded on the recording medium.
