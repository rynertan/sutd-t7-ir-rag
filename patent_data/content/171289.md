# Ceramic articles having a nonporous core and porous outer layer.

## Abstract
This invention relates to high technology ceramics. The ceramic articles of this invention are fired, non vitreous, monolithic, non fused ceramic articles in various forms. Articles capable of being filled or infiltrated with certain substances in a controlled geometry and in controlled amounts to render the articles useful for special applica tions, e. g., catalytic, reinforcing, are rare. The articles of this invention exhibit a uniform, porous sheath and a core. The porous sheath or outer layer of the articles can be filled with various infiltrates, e. g., catalysts, in order to provide the articles with useful properties. The articles can be prepared by treating fired ceramic articles with a leachant, e. g., hydro fluoric acid or a precursor thereof.
