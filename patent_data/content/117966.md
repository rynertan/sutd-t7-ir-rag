## Description
BACKGROURD OF THE INVEiTION The present invention relates to a composable paving tile structure, parricularly for making floorings and the like. As it is known,there are presently commercial ly available resilient floors,which are made start ing from vinyl, rubber, linoleum and the like materials, in the form oi tiles or rolls, or several different size. the mentioned floors, which may be defined as conventional, are to be realized by skilled personnel, by using suitable adhesive materials and by precisely levelling the concrete Dearing surface. Lore specifically the floorings of the above mentioned type can not be laid in moist environments, since the used adhesive materials are not erfective to satisfactorily bind the tiles to the bearing floor surface, with consequent distortions of the tiles themselves, in particular as the latter are or the roll type. Thus,the resilient known tiles can not be applied directly on the grouna ,on basements or in open spaces. SUMMARY 0 I HE INVENTION Accordingly the task or the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing such a composable paving tile structure, for making floorings and the like, which, while being made from resilient materials,may be easily ana quickly applied even in moist environments, without the need of using any adhesive materials. Within that task, it is a main object of the present invention to provide such a paving tile Which is effective to be.applied by unskilled personnel, by means of simple operations. Another object of the invention is to provide snch a paving tile which may be formed with any desired surface finishings, for fitting the desired environment architecture. Yet another object of the present invention i to provide such a paving tile structure which may be produces starting from easily commercially available materials and wich is highly competitive from an economical standpoint. According to one aspect or the present invention the above task and obJectsas well as yet other objects mulch will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by a composable paving tile for making floorings and the like, characterized in that it comprises a plastics material plate like element provided with a top floor surrace ana an under reinrorcement ana bearing cell structure,said cell structure being peripherically encompassed by a perimetrical edge provided with mating female and male elements erfective to mutually engage with male and female elements of an adjoining paving tile respectively. BRIEF DESCRIP2ION OF THE DRAWINGS Further characteristics and advantages or the paving tile structure according to the present invention will become more apparent thereinafter from the following description of an embodiment whereof, being illustrated by way of an indicative example in the accompanying drawings, where tigl is a perspective view schematically illustrating a tile portion,as seen from the exposed surface whereof fig.2 is another perspective view schematical ly illustrating a tile portion, as seen from the bottom whereof fig.3 illustrates a female coupling element included in the paving tile according to the invention tig.4 is a partial cross sectional view illustrating a male coupling element facing a corresponding female coupling element, for coupling two adjoining paving tiles and fig.5 schematically illustrates a flooring which may De constructed by using the paving tiles according to the invention DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIENT With reference to the drawings, the composable paving tile tor making floorings and the like, according to the present invention, which is indicated overally at 1, comprises a plate like element 2whieh is nade rrom a plastics material,consisting,prererably, ol a polyvinylchloride stabilizing material mineral riller mixture. Preferably, though noz necessarily, the paving tiles have a square shape,with size Which may range from 25x25 to 60x60 cn,and with thicknesses which may range from 6 to 12 mm. To this respect it should be noted that the tile may be made with any desired geometrical shapes, provided that it is effective to be laid on a flat surface. More specifically, the above mentioned plate like element 2 is provided, on the top surface whereof,with a load bearing surface 3 which, advantageous ly is provided with a raised pattern 4,of any desired design, since the making mola affords the possibility of interchanging the embossing elements whereof. On the lower or bottom sieve whereof, the plate like element 2 is provided with a cell structure 5, formed by interlacing strips arranged with their small sides on a horizontal plane. It will however be clear that the tile bottom, which provides a reinforcement and bearing function, may be realized with other geometrical shapes, such as in the form of circles, diamonds, rectangles and so on, the inventive idea being that of having such a structure effective to support ana stiffen the plate like element 2, in such a way as to hold it spacea from the tile bearing surface or ground. On the periphery there or, the mentioned cell structure is bound or encompassed by a perimetrical edge 10, having substantially the same heigth as said strips forming the cell structure, which edge is joined to the strips themselves. More specifically the perimetrical edge 10 derines male and female counling elements, which may be mutually engaged in order to ioin adjoining paving tiles 1. According to a preferred embodiment, the male coupling elements consist or pins ll,providea with a respective enlarged head 12,and perpendicularly project ing from the edge 10 in such a way as to extend in a parallel plane to the paving tile lying plane. The mentioned coupling male elements ll,may be inserted into the corresponding coupling female elements, consisting of notches 15,also defined on the edge 10, and are providea,at the bottom whereof with a lead in tapered portion 16 joining with a circular zone 17,with the interposition of tooth members 18, which allow ror a pin 11 to be snap engaged and held in its engaging position, with its enlarged head being prevented rrom exiting the circular opening 17. According to a preferred embodiment, the male coupling elements are formed on two adjoining sides of the paving tile 1, whereas the female coupling elements are provided on the two other adjoining sides. Obviously any other suitable arrangement may be usea,effective to provide an insertion type of coupling. The thus constructed paving tiles are of the auto assembling type and may be applied without using any adhesive materials, thereby they may be laid also on moist environments, by unskilled personnel. From the above disclosure, it will be clear that the invention fully achieves the intended objects. In particular the fact is to be pointed out that the paving tile according to the invention may be easily and quickly coupled to adjoining like tiles, thereby affording the possibility of making stable floorings without using any adhesive materials. In practicing the invention,the usea materials, though the best results have been obtained by using the thereinabove mentioned materials,as well as the contingent shapes and sizes may be any according to requirements.
