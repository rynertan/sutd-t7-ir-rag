# Surface inspection equipment.

## Abstract
The invention concerns the inspection of the corners of a square or rectangular metal billet. The inspection apparatus includes inspection probes 25 supported from a scanning head mounted between entry and exit boxes 13 . The two boxes include ram displaceable rollers 4 which are moved into engagement with the other surfaces of the billet as it passes through the apparatus so positively siting the inspec tion probes above the corners of the billet. The probes are connected to transmit electrical pulses representative of the condition of the billet corners to signal processing equipment remote from the inspection apparatus.
