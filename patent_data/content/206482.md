## Description
This invention relates to solid state switching circuits and more particularly, to such a circuit employing MOSFETS connected in a series configuration. Switching circuits employed for switching string arrays, generally make use of diode switches connected in a blocking shunt configuration. Shunt control can subject an array to damage due to hot spots resulting from partial shadowing. The switching circuit of the present invention also provides several other distinct advantages over such switching circuits of the prior art. First, less drive power is required. Also, fewer components are needed, making for economy of construction. Further, the voltage drop across the switching device of the present invention is much lower than that of prior art solid state switches. In addition, the circuit of the present invention is capable of conducting current in either direction while blocking voltages with respect to the drive reference node of either polarity. The enhancement type MOSFETS employed also have the built in capacitance needed for rise and fall time control of the switching action. Briefly described, the switching circuit of the present invention employs a pair of enhancement type MOSFET chips connected in series between a switching control circuit and a circuit the switching of which is to be controlled. The sources of the two MOSFETS are connected together in common as are the gates thereof. The gates are driven in response to a signal from the switching control circuit while the drain of one of the MOSFETS is connected to the power return circuit of the circuit being controlled while the drain of the other MOSFET is connected to the return of the switching control circuit e.g. common ground . The two MOSFETS are biased at cut off in the absence of a switching control signal being fed to their gates. A predetermined switching control circuit fed to such gates will activate both MOSFETS, completing the return path for the controlled circuit and thus activitating this circuit. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved solid state switching circuit requiring fewer components and of lesser cost than prior art circuits of this general type. It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved solid state switching circuit requiring less power drive and involving less voltage drop than the prior art circuits. It is still a further object of this invention to provide an improved solid state switching circuit which is capable of conducting current in either direction and which will block voltages of either polarity with respect to the drive reference node. Other objects of this invention will become apparent as the description proceeds in connection with the accompanying drawings of which the sole figure is a schematic drawing of a preferred embodiment of the invention. A pair of enhancement type MOSFET chips 11 and 12 are connected together with their gates in common and their sources in common. These MOSFETS may, for example be, type IRF 150, manufactured by International Rectifier Corporation. The drain of MOSFET 12 is connected to the power return for switching control circuit 14 which may be a common ground connection. A switching control signal 16, which may typically comprise a negative signal of sufficient amplitude to fire keying transistor 17, is fed from switching control circuit 14 to the base of the transistor to effect the firing thereof. With the firing of transistor 17, a positive voltage from bias source 20 is applied to the gates of the MOSFETS which fires both MOSFETS to the conductive state. The drain of MOSFET 11 is connected to the return circuit for the controlled circuit 22 which may comprise an element in a string array of components which need to be energized in a predetermined manner, in response to switching control circuit 14. This, of course, is only one exemplary use for the switching circuit of the present invention and it could be used to equal advantage in many other different types of switching applications. Controlled circuit 22 receives its power from a suitable power source 25 which uses the same common return ground as switching control circuit 14. Thus, when MOSFETS 11 and 12 are fired, the return circuit for controlled circuit 22 is completed causing this circuit to be activated. Resistor 30 provides cut off bias between the common sources and gates of the MOSFETS in the absence of a drive signal from transistor 17. Transistor 17 may be, for example, a type 2N5153, manufactured by Texas Instruments. Current limiting resistor 32 is placed in the drive circuit between the collector of transistor 17 and the gates of the MOSFETS to limit the drive current. As already noted, in the absence of any drive signal, the MOSFETS are held at cut off by virtue of the biasing voltage developed across resistor 30. When a drive signal, as indicated by signal 16 is present, both MOSFETS 11 and 12 go to their conductive state to provide a very low resistance path typically of the order of .1 ohm between the two drain terminals thus effectively completing the return circuit for controlled circuit 22 and causing this circuit to go to the ON state. The built in capacitances of the MOSFETS provide for slow turn off and turn on without the need for external capacitors. Turn off and turn on times can be determined by adjusting the values of resistors 30 and 32 as may be desired. While the invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to clearly understood that this is intended by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the invention being limited only by the terms of the following claims.
