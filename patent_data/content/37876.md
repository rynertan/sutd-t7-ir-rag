# Electrochemical eroding process for semiconductors.

## Abstract
Semiconductor devices 3 are fabricated that have precise uniform thickness regions formed by a self limiting process in which light 5 generated hole electron pairs are used as a source of current in electrochemical erosion. A self aligned MESFET semiconductor structure has the gate 15 positioned in etched undercuts 13, 14 of the source and drain regions 9 12 . Arrays of enhancement and depletion mode FET devices can be made on the same substrate.
