# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO CHAIN SAW BARS

## Abstract
A chain saw having a saw chain and a chain bar, the saw chain comprising a plurality cutter links interconnected by connector links, the chain saw further having a sprocket or roller mounted for rotation in the plane of the bar adjacent the nose thereof, whereby the saw chain is guided around the nose of the chain bar, the sprocket or roller being shaped to receive driving tongues of the chain such that the cutter links of the chain are guided on a path of small radius than the path of movement of the connector links so that the depth of cut possible by the cutter links is reduced.
