# POLYGLYCIDYL ETHERS OF TRICYCLODECANE AND CURED EPOXY RESINS THEREFROM

## Abstract
Polyglycidyl ethers of tricyclodecane are provided which are useful as monomers in the production of cured epoxy resins. Also provided are polyallyl ethers of tricyclodecane which are novel intermediates in the preparation of the polyglycidyl ethers and a method of preparing the polygly cidyl ethers of this invention which uses the novel intermedi ates.
