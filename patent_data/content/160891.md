## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED 3 2,3 DIHYDRO lH INDEN 5 yl 4 HYDROXY lH PYRROLE 2,5 DIONES, THEIR ANALOGS AND THEIR SALTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Trauma to the brain or spinal cord caused by physical forces acting on the skull or spinal column, by ischemic stroke, arrested breathing, cardiac arrest, Reye s syndrome, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, encephalomyelitis, hydrocephalus, post operative brain injury, cerebral infections and various concussions results in edema and swelling of the affected tissues. This is followed by ischemia, hypoxia, necrosis, temporary or permanent brain and or spinal cord injury and may result in death.The tissue mainly affected are classified as grey matter, more specifically astroglial cells. The specific therapy currently used for the treatment of the medical problems described include various kinds of diuretics particularly osmotic diuretics , steroids such as, 6 a methylprednisolone succinate and barbiturates. The usefulness of these agents is questionable and they are associated with a variety of untoward complications and side effects. Thus, the eompounds of this invention comprise a novel and specific treatment of medical problems where no specific therapy is available. A recent publication entitled Agents for the Treatment of Brain Injury 1. AryloxyalkanoicAcids, Cragoe et al, J. Med. Chem., 1982 25, 567 79, reports on recent experimental testing of agents for treatment of brain injury and reviews the current status of treatment of brain injury. In addition, some compounds having structures related to the compounds of the present invention have been reported as being useful in the treatment and prevention of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation in U.S. Patent 4,342,776 of Cragoe et al. There is, however, no suggestion in the patent that any of the compounds disclosed therein would be of use in the treatment of brain injury. The compounds of the invention have the added advantage of being devoid of the phatmacodynamic, toxic or various side effects characterOstic of the diuretics, steroids and barbiturates.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the instant invention are best characterized by reference to the following structural formula EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof whereinR is cycloalkyl C3 to C6 , cycloalkyllower alkyl C4 to C7 total , aryl, such as phenyl, substituted aryl, such as phenyl with substituents, such as halo, methyl, methoxy, and hydroxy, heterocyclic, such as thienyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl and phenethyl, lower alkyl, branched or unbranched, lower alkenyl, branched or unbranched and lower alkynyl and the like, provided that when A is a bond Formulae I A and I B below or when A is Oand Z is H and OH Formula I D below , R is not cycloalkyl or alkyl when R is lower alkyl and X andY are both chloro and when the compounds are racemic.R is lower alkyl, branched or unbranched, alkenyl or alkynyl and the like. X and Y awrMe,, chloro or methyl and the like and A is a bond, 0 , or O CH2 , where q is 1 to 5 and Z is O or H and OH. When the R and R substituents are different, the 2 position carbon atom of the indane ring is asymmetric and these compounds of the invention are racemic. However, these compounds or their precursors can be resolved so that the pure enantiomers can be prepared, thus the invention includes the pure enantiomers. This is an important point since some of the racemates consist of one enantiomer which is much more active than the other one. Furthermore, the less active enantiomer generally possesses the same intrinsic toxicity as the more active enantiomer. In addition, it can be demonstrated that the less active enantiomer depresses the inhibitory action of the active enantiomer at the tissue level. Thus, for three reasons it is advantageous to use the pure, more active enantiomer rather than the racemate. An example of this is seen with the compound of Example 1, which is 3 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclo pentyl 2,3 dihydro 2 methyl 1 oxo lH inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy lE pyrrol e 2,5 dione l methylpiperazine salt which is much more active than the enantiomer described in Example 23. Thus by using the pure enantiomer, not only has the much less active component of the racemate been eliminated but its unwanted contribution to toxicity and side effects abolished and its detrimental effect on intrinsic activity has been eliminated. With the compounds where Z is H and OH, i.e.those where there is a hydroxy group on the l position of the indane ring, a second asymmetric carbon atom the 1 position of the indane ring is established. Therefore, the compounds where Z is H and OH and R and R are different consist of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemate. However, the diastereomecs can be separated by fractional crystallization or chromatography. When intermediates which are preresolved at the 2 position of the indane ring, reduction of a l indanone to a l indanol produces two diastereomers, each consisting of a single enantiomer, which can be separated by fractional crystallization or chromatography. This type of compound is illustrated by Examples 32 and 33. Since the products of the invention are acidic, the invention also includes the obvious pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as the sodium, potassium, ammonium, trimethylammonium, piperazinium, l methylpiperazinium, guanidinium, bis 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium, N methylglucosammonium and the like salts. It is also to be noted that the compounds ofFormula I, as well as their salts of Formula I G, often form solvates with the solvents in which they are prepared or from which they are recrystallizedThese solvates may be used per se or they may be desolvated by heating e.g. at 700C in vacuo. Although the invention primarily involves novel substituted 3 2,3 dihydro lH inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 diones, and their salts, it also includes their derivatives, such as oximes, hydrazones and the like. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is included a novel group of compounds which are pure enantiomers of compounds ofFormula I A EMI5.1 wherein X, Y, R and R are defined as hereinabove, provided that R and R are not the wame entities, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form containing an effective amount of one of the compounds encompassed by the above formula and the method of treating brain injury using one of said pharmaceutical compositions.

In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is included a novel group of diastereomers and their enantiomers of Formula I D EMI8.1 said diastereomers being derived by reduction of the pure enantiomer, especially the pure enantiomer of the corresponding l oxo compound, as well as pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form containing an effective amount of one of the novel derived diastereomers. Also included are the corresponding racemic compounds wherein X, Y, R and R are defined as hereinabove provided that R is not cyclo alkylor alkyl when R is lower, alkyl or cycloalkyl and X.and Y are both chloro. cIn accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel group of compounds of Formula I E EMI9.1 wherein Z, X, Y, R, R and q are as defined hereinabove and the optical isomers thereof, whereinR and R are different entities, and or Z is H andOH, as well as pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form containing an effective amount of a compound of the above formula or a pure enantiomer, particularly the enantiomer or diastereoisomer derived therefrom by reduction of the corresponding l oxo compound.PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION The preferred embodiments of the instant invention are realized in structural Formula I F wherein EMI9.2 R2 is cyclopentyl, phenol or benzylZ is as defined before. R is lower alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl, and A1 is a bond, 0 , and O CH2Xq where q is l to 4. Also included are the diastereomers and the enantiomers of each racemate. Preferred compounds are 3 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2,3 dihydro 2 methyl 1 oxo 1H inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy 1H pyrrole 2,5 dione and its nontoxic salts. Other preferred compounds are 3 2 butyl 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2,3 dihydro 2 methyl l oxo 1H inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy 1H pyrrole 2,5 dione, and its enantiomer and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other preferred compounds are 3 2 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2,3 dihydro 2 methyl 1 oxo lH inden 5 yl oxy ethylj 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2, 5 dione. Other preferred compounds are 3 6,7 dichloro 2,3 dihydro 2 methyl 1 oxo 2 phenyl 1Hinden 5 yl 4 hydroxy 1H pyrrole 2,5 dione, its enantiomer and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other preferred compounds include 3 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2,3 dihydro 1 hydroxy 2methyl 1H inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy 1H pyrrole 2,5 dione, its alpha diastereomer and the B diastereomer each of which are pure enantiol rs and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other preferred compounds include 3 12 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2, 3 dihydro l hydroxy 2 methyl lH inden 5 yl oxy ethyl0 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 dione, its a diastereomer, its ss diaster isomer each of which are pure enantiomers and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other preferred compounds include the diastereomer and ss diastereomer of 3 2 6,7 dichloro 2 cyclopentyl 2,3 dihydro l hydroxy 2 methyl lH inden 5 yl oxy 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 dione, each of which consists of a single pure enantiomer. Especially preferred are the pure enantiomers since, in most instances, one enantiomer is more active biologically then its antipode. Included within the scope of this invention are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the parent 3 substituted 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 diones since a major medical use of these compounds is solutions of their soluble salts which can be administered parenterally. Thus, the acid addition salts can be prepared by the reaction of the 3 substituted 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 diones of this invention with an appropriate amine, ammonium hydroxide, guanidine, alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate, quaternary ammonium hydroxide and the like. The salts selected are derived from among the non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The synthesis of the 3 substituted 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 diones of Formula I are generally carried out by the reaction of the appropriate amide Formula II with diethyl oxalate in the presence of a base and a solvent. EMI12.1 Advantageously, the base that iv used can be potassium tert. butoxide but other r bases, such as sodium ethoxide or potassium methoxide can be used. The use of dimethylformamide is especially advantageous as a solvent but other polar, inert solvents such as l methyl 2 pyrrolidinone can be used. The reaction is generally conducted at the ambient temperature but it can be conducted at temperatures as low as 100C and as high as 500C for periods of time of 6 to 24 hours, depending on the specific reactants. Tne reaction can be conducted using amides of Formula 11 which are mixtures of diastereomers, pure diastereomers, racemates or pure enantiomers and, thus, obtain the corresponding 3 substituted 4 hydroxy IH pyrroline 2,5 diones of Formula I as mixtures of diastereomers, pure diastereomers, racemates or pure enantiomers. Some 3 2,3 dihydro 1 oxo lH inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2,5 diones of the instant invention are advantageously prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding 3 2,3 dihydro I hydroxy lH inden 5 yl 4 hydroxy lH pyrrole 2, 5 diones. Advantageously this is carried out using an oxidizing agent, such as Jones reagent Cr03 in dilute sulfuric acid using a solvent, such as acetone, 2 butanone, and the like. The reaction is generally conducted at ambient temperatures but temperatures in the range of 100 to 400C can be used. The preparation of the intermediate amides of Formula II is carried out by any one of several methods involving the reaction of the appropriate ester Formula III, acid chloride of Formula TV or acylimidazole of Formula V with ammonia.EMI13.1 The reaction of an ester of Formula III is generally carried out in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or l methyl 2 pyrrolidinone and then ammonia in a solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, is added.Ambient temperature is advantageously employed but temperatures as low as IOOC or as high as 1000C can be used however, when higher temperatures are employed, it is necessary to use a sealed vessel to contain the ammonia. The reaction time varies, depending on the temperature and may require from twelve hours to four weeks. When an acid chloride of Formula IV is used, the reaction is generally conducted in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride or benzene and the ammonia added in a solvent like ether or a mixture of ether and methylene chloride. Usually it is also advantageous to introduce ammonia gas and finally aqueous ammonia. The reaction is generally conducted at temperatures in the range of OOC to IOOC but, if a sealed reaction vessel is used, temperatures of 100 to 500C can be used. The reaction times are generally in the range of 10 minutes to two hours. When an amide of Formula II is prepared from an acylimidazole of Formula V, a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane is employed since the acylimidazole is generated in that solvent. Then, the acylimidazole is treated with ammonia gas or aqueous ammonia. The reaction is generally carried out at ambient temperatures but temperatures as low as 10 C or as high as 500C can be used. The preparation of amides of Formula II A, i.e. those in which Z H OH are best prepared by reduction of the corresponding compound of FormulaII B where Z O. The reduction is advantageously conducted using sodium borohydride in a solvent like ethanol at room temperature for a period of 1 to 5 hours.EMI15.1 One method for the preparation of the intermediate esters of Formula III is carried out byesterification of the appropriate carboxylic acid ofFormula VI.EMI15.2 The reaction is conducted using the appropriate alcohol Alkyl OH such as methanol or ethanol, as a solvent and employing a small quantity of an acid catalyst, such as boron trifluoride etherate, sulfuric acid or p toluenesulfonic acid. The reaction is generally carried out at the boiling point of the alcohol for a period of one to five hours. Another method of preparing esters of Formula SII will be described later. The intermediate acid chlorides of FormulaIV are generally generated by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by the reaction of the appropriate acid of Formula VI with a reagent, such as, thionyl chloride in a solvent, such as benzene or toluene at the boiling point of the solvent for a period of one to four hours.EMI16.1 The intermediate acylimidazoles can be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate carboxylic acid of Formula VI with l,l carbonyldiimidazole in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane at temperatures of 100 to 100C for periods of 15 minutes to 2 hours. The carboxylic acid intermediates of FormulaVI where A is O or O CH2 q are designated byFormula VI A. They are prepared by any one of several methods EMI17.1 The first method involves heating the ester of Formula VII, where R4 alkyl, in a solution of acetic acid and an aqueous inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. The hydrolysis also can be effected in aqueous alcoholic base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in aqueous methanol or ethanol. The product is recovered by acidification with an acid, such as, hydrochloric acid.The reaction can be carried out at temperature of 30 C to 1000C for periods of about 20 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the specific ester used and the other reaction conditions. In the instances, where the ester is sensitive to strong base, it is advantageous to carry out the hydrolysis using a weak base, such as aqueous sodium bicarbonate. A solvent, such as aqueous ethanol, methanol or isopropyl alcohol is used and the mixture heated to 450C to 100 C for periods of 15 minutes to 4 hours. Acidification of the reaction mixture with a strong aqueous acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid produces the desired compound of Formula VI. A second method for the preparation of compounds of the type illustrated by Formula VI involve the reaction of a haloalkanoic or halocycloalkanoic acid W A COOH with the appropriate phenol of Formula VIII. Using a haloalkanoic or halocycloalkanoic acid W A COOH, where W iodo, bromo or chloro and A is as defined above, for example, iodoacetic acid or bromofluoroacetic acid, as the etherification agent, the reaction is conducted in the presence of a base. The base is selected from among the alkaline earth or alkali metal bases such as sodium or potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and the like. The reaction is carried out in a liquid reaction milieu, the choice being based on the nature of the reactants however, solvents which are reasonably inert to the reactants and are fairly good solvents for the compounds of Formula VIII and the W A COOH reagent, can be used. Highly preferable are dimethyl forir .mide, ethanol, acetone, and N methyl 2 py olidinone and the like. A third method for preparing compounds ofFormula VI involves the pyrolysis of the corresponding tert. butyl ester of Formula IX. This method involves heating a tert. butyl ester of the type illustrated by Formula IX at from about 800C to 1200C in a suitable nonaqueous solvent in the presence of catalytic amount of a strong acid. The solvents are generally selected from among the type benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. and the acid catalyst may be a strong organic or inorganic acid, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric etc. The acid, being a catalyst, is generally used in relatively small quantities as compared to the tert. butyl ester, IX.It is to be noted that this reaction is a pyrolysis and not a hydrolysis, since water is excluded from the reaction and the products are a carboxylic acid Formula VI and isobutylene and no alcohol is produced. Another method of converting compounds ofType IX to those of Type VI is by heating compounds of Type IX with trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent like dichloromethane. A fourth method is limited to the instances wherein A O CH2 2, which produces compounds ofFormula VI A. In this method, a compound of FormulaX is oxidized to a compound of Formula VI A.EMI19.1 The reaction is conducted in a solvent mixture of water and methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride using an oxidizing agent, such as potassium permanganate and a phase transfer agent, such at triton B and the like. The reaction is conducted conveniently at 10 C, but temperatures as low as 50C or as high as 350C can be used for periods of 30 minutes to 6 hours. The product is conveniently isolated by reducing the excess potassium permanganate with sodium bisulfite and hydrochloric acid, extracting the organic phase with aqueous sodium hydroxide and acidifying the aqueous extract with an acid such as hydrochloric acid. If necessary, the product is purified by chromatography or recrystallization. Compounds of formula X are prepared from the corresponding phenol of Formula VIII by reaction with l bromobutene or l iodobutene. The reaction whereHal bromo or iodo EMI20.1 is conveniently conducted in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide, 1 methyl pyrrolidone and the like. A base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate is employed to scavange the acid that is produced by the reaction. It is often beneficial to heat the base with the phenol VIII for a period of minutes to an hour at 900 to 1000C to generate the sal, of the phenol before the l br obutene or l iodobutene is added. The final rEaction is generally conducted at temperatures of 500 to 1000C for periods of 12 to 24 hours. The esters of Formula VII or IX are conveniently prepared by the reaction of a phenol ofFormula VIII with a haloalkanoic acid ester ofFormula W CH2 qCOOH4n When R is tert. butyl, compounds of Formula IX are produced.EMI21.1 If lower temperatures are employed or if the particular halo ester is not very reactive, the reaction time may be much longer. In general, the reaction is conducted in the presence of a base, such as an alkali metal carbonate, hydroxide or alkoxide such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide and the like. Solvents which are essentially inert to the reactants and product and in which the reactants and product are reasonably soluble are usually employed. Dimethylformamide, ethanol and acetone, for example, have been found to be especially advantageous to use as solvents. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature in the range from about 250C to the boiling point temperature of the particular solvent employed. The reaction is generally complete in about 15 to 60 minutes but, the reaction may require a longer period of time. The phenols of Formula VIII are prepared by any one of s veral methods but the following method is especiall convenient. This procedure involves the ether cleavage of anisoles of Formula XI or oxyacetic acids of Formula VI B. This ether cleavage is EMI22.1 accomplished by any one of many agents known to cleave ethers, especially useful are the hydrohalide salts of weak bases, such as pyridine hydrochloride or pyridine hydrobromide, but other agents, such as aqueous hydrobromic acid, aluminum bromide or sodium nitrite in dimethylformamide can be used. When pyridine hydrohalides are used, the temperatures above that which these substances melt are generally employed. This usually involves temperatures in the range of 1500 to 215 C., but temperatures somewhat lower or higher can be used.The period of heating varies depending on the specific compound, but periods of from 15 minutes to 2 hours may be used. The e anisoles of Formula XI are prepared by any one of several methods known to those skilled in the art however, a convenient method consists in the reaction of a compound of Formula XII with a compound of Formula W R where W is as defined previously iodo, bromo or chloro . EMI23.1 The reaction is generally carried out by first treating the compound of Formula XII with a suitable base, for example, an alkali metal hydride, such as sodium hydride and the like, or an alkali metal alkoxide, for example potassium tert. butoxide and the like. The ion that is generated is then treated with the compound of Formula W R an alkyl halide, alkenyl halide or alkynyl halide . Any solvent which is substantially inert to the reactants employed may be used. Suitable solvents include, for example, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, tert. butyl alcohol, benzene, toluene, dimethylformamide and the like. The reaction is conducted at temperatures in the range of 250C to about 1250C. In general, the reaction is conducted in the range from about 150 to 500C. It is beneficial to conduct the reaction in a dry, inert atmosphere, for example in dry nitrogen or dry argon. The carboxylic acid intermediates of FormulaVI where A is a bond and Z is O designated asVI B are prepared by the following sequence of three synthetic steps. EMI24.1 The 2, 3 dihydro 1 oxo lH inden yl trifluoromethanesulfonates of Formula XIV are prepared from the corresponding phenols of FormulaVIII. The reaction is conducted in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide or l methyl 2 pyrrolidinone in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. The reaction is generally carried out at temperatures in the range of 10tC to 450C but temperatures somewhat higher or lower can be used. The reaction time varies from 30 minutes to 6 hours. The diethyl 2,3 dihydro 1 oxo lH inden yl malonates of Formula XV are prepared by the reaction of compounds of Formula XIV with a metal salt of diethylmalonate. The metal salt of diethyl malonate is conveniently prepared from diethyl malonate and sodium hydride in an Invert atmosphere using a solvent, such as dimethylformamide or 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone. The metal salt of diethyl malonate in the solvent is then treated with a compound ofFormula XIV in an inert organic solvent, for example benzene or toluene. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature of 50C to 500C for a period of 6 to 24 hours. Finally, the compounds of Formula VI B are prepared by heating compounds of Formula XV with aqueous base. Bases, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide are especially useful. To achieve adequate solubility during the reaction, an inert organic solvent is employed, such as ethanol or propanol along with the water. The reaction is generally conducted at temperatures in range of 500C to 1000C for periods of 2 to 24 hours. The final product VI B is generated by acidification of the reaction mixture. As mentioned earlier, the compounds of this invention possess one and sometimes two asymmetric carbon atoms. In the instances where they possess two asymmetric carbon atoms, the reaction whereby these chiral centers are established can produce two diastereomers. These may be separated to obtain each pure diastereomer by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by fractional crystallization, column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography and the like. Those compounds possessing only one asymmetric carbon atom, as well as each pure diastereomer from compounds possessing two asymmetric carbon atoms, consist of a racemate composed of two enantiomers. The resolution of the two enantiomers may by accomplished by forming a salt of the racemic mixture with an optically active base such as or amphetamine, cinchonidine, dehydroabiethylamine, or a methylbenzylamine, or l naphthyl ethylamine. cinchonine, brucine, or strychnine and the like in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol, benzene, acetonitrile, nitromethane, acetone and the like. There is formed in the solution, two diastereomeric salts, one of which is usually less soluble in the solvent than the other.Repetitive recrystallization of the crystalline salt generally affords a pure diastereomeric salt from which is obtained the desired pure enantiomer. The optically pure enantiomer of the compound of Formula I is obtained by acidification of the salt with a mineral acid, isolation by filtration and recrystallization of the optically pure antipode. The other optically pure antipode may generally be obtained by using a different base to form the diastereomeric salt. It is of advantage to isolate the partially resolved acid from the filtrates of the purification of the first diastereomeric salt and to further purify this substance through the use of another optically active base. It is especially advantageous to use an optically active base for the isolation of the second enantiomer which is the antipode of the base used for the isolation of the first enantiomer. For example, if i methylbenzylamine was used first, then a methylbenzylamine is used for the isolation of the second remaining enantiomer. A method which is especially useful in obtaining pure enantiomers involving asymmetry about the 2 carbon atom is to use pure enantiomers of the intermediate compounds. This is particularly advantageous in the instance of compounds of Formula VI, most particularly compound of Formula VI B. These compounds are readily resolved by the methods described above and many have already been described in the scientific and patent literature. These resolved compounds can then be used per se in subsequent synthetic steps, such as conversion to compounds of the types illustrated by Formula III,IV, V or VII which ultimately lead to compounds ofFormula I which are pure enantiomers. When compounds of Formula I are prepared where both the l carbon atom and the 2 carbon atom of the indane ring are asymmetric, the two diastereomers that are produced may be separated by methods wellknown to those that are skilled in the art. For example, methods such as fractional crystallization, column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography and the like may be used. The instances where intermediate compounds are used which are preresolved to the pure enantiomers in regard to the 2 carbon atom prior to establishment of the asymmetry about the l carbon is established are especially advantageous. An example of this is the reduction of a compound of Formula II B to one of Formula Il A. In this situation, two diastereomers are produced but each consists of a single enantiomer. Thus, by using one of the methods for separating diastereomers listed above, the two diastereomers can be separated to obtain two pure enantiomers. Therefore, by starting with a pure enantiomer of Formula VI, two of the possible enantiomers can be obtained. Then, by using the opposite enantiomer of Formula VI the other two enantiomers can be obtained.This provides a method of obtaining all four enantiomers of compounds of Formula I where both the 1 carbon and 2 carbon atoms are asymmetric. The acid addition salts of Formula I G where B represents a cation from a pharmaceutically acceptable base are prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid of Formula I with an appropriate base of formula BH, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth bicarbonate, carbonate or alkoxide, an amine, ammonia, an organic quaternary ammonium hydroxide, guanidine and the like. The reaction is illustrated below EMI28.1 The reaction is generally conducted in water when alkali metal hydroxides are used, but when alkoxides and the organic bases are used, the reaction may be conducted in an organic solvent, such as ether, ethanol, dimethylformamide and the like. The preferred salts are the sodium, ammonium, diethanolamine, 1 methylpiperazine, piperazine and the like salts. It is to be recognized that compounds ofFormula I are dibasic acids but it is generally intended to prepare only the salts derived from the more acidic center as shown by Formula I G.Therefore, only bases of the appropriate base strength are used to produce the monobasic salts ofFormula I G or, alternatively, the bases are used only in amounts equivalent to the molar quantities of the acid. In the instance of diacidic bases, for example l methylpiperazine, molecular equivalent amounts of compounds of Formula I and BH are used. Inasmuch as there are a variety of symptoms and severity associated with grey matter edema, particularly when it is caused by head trauma stoke, cerebral hemorrhage or embolism, post operative brain surgery trauma, spinal cord injury, cerebral infections and various brain concussions, the precise treatment is left to the practitioner. Therefore, it is left to the judgment of the practitioner to determine the patient s response to treatment and to vary the dosages accordingly. A recommended dosage range is from 1 microgram kg to 20 mg kg of body weight as a primary dose and a sustaining dose of half to equal the primary dose, every 4 to 24 hours. The compounds of this invention can be administered by a variety of established methods, including intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or orally. As with dosage, the precise mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. However, for the very ill and comatose patient, the parenteral route, particularly the intravenous route of administration is highly preferred. Another advantage of the intravenous route of administration is the speed with which therapeutic brain levels of the drug are achieved. it is of paramount importance in brain injury of the type described to initiate therapy as rapidly as possible and to maintain it through the critical time periods. For this purpose, the intravenous administration of drugs of the typeFormula I in the form of their salts Formula T G is superior. One aspect of this invention is the treatment of persons with grey matter edema by concomitant administration of a compound of Formula I or I G, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and an antiinflammatory steroid. These steroids are of some, albeit limited, use in control of white matter edema associated with ischemic stroke and head injury.Steroid therapy is given according to established practice as a supplement to the compound of Formula I or I G as taught elsewhere herein. Similarly, a barbiturate may be administered as a supplement to treatment with a compound of Formula I or I G. The compounds of Formula I or I G are utilized by formulating them in a composition such as tablet, capsule or elixir for oral administration.Sterile solutions or suspensions can be used for parenteral administration. About 70 micrograms to 750 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds ofFormula I or I G, its a physiologically acceptable salts compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc. in a dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in the composition is such that dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit from is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise enhance the pharmaceutical elegance of the preparation. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or the like.A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a conventional vehicle such as water by injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like. . ffer, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. The basic premise for the development of agents for the treatment of brain injury of the types described i8 based on the studies in experimental head injury by R.S. Bourke et. al. R. S. Bourke,M.A. Daze and H.K. Kimelberg, Monograph of theInternational Glial Cell symposium, Leige, Bel. August 29 31, 1977 and references cited therein and experimental stroke by J. B. Garcia et. al. J.H.Garcia, E. Kalimo, V. Kamiayo and B.F. Trump,Virchows Archiv. Zellopath.3, 25, 191 1977 . These and other studies have shown that the primary site of traumatic brain injury is in the grey matter where the process follows a pattern of insult, edema, ischemia, hypoxia, neuronal death and necrosis followed, in many instances, by irreversible coma or death. The discovery of a drug that specifically prevents the edema would obviate the sequalae. Experimental head injury has been shown to produce a pathophysiological response primarily involving swelling of astroglia as a secondary, inhibitable process. At the molecular level, the sequence appears to be trauma, elevation of extracellular K and or release of neurotransmitters, edema, hypoxia and necrosis. Astroglisl swelling results directly from AK dependent, cation coupled, chloride transport from the extracellular into the intracellular compartment with a concomitant movement of an osmotic equivalent of water. Thus, an agent that specifically blocks chloride transport in the astroglia is expected to block the edema caused by trauma and other insults to the brain. It is also important that such chloride transport inhibitors be free or relatively free of side effects, particularly those characteristics of many chloride transport inhibitors, such as diuretic properties. Compounds of the type illustrated by Formula T and I G exhibit the desired effects on brain edema and are relative free of renal effects. That this approach is valid has been demonstrated by the correlation of the in vitro astroglial edema inhibiting effects of chloride transport inhibitors with their ability to reduce the mortality of animals receiving experimental in vivo head injury. As a final proof, one compound ethacrynic acid which exhibited activity both in vitro and in vivo assays was effective in reducing mortality in clinical cases of head injury. These studies are described in the Journal of MedicinalChemistry, Volume 18, page 567 1982 . Three major biological assays can be used to demonstrate biological activity of the compounds.The 1 in vitro cat cerebrocortical tissue slice assay, 2 the in vitro primary rat astrocyte culture assay and 3 the in vivo cat head injury assay. The first assay, the in vitro cat cerebrocortical tissue slice assay has been described by Marshall, L. F. Shapiro, H. M. Smith, R. W. In Seminars inNeurological Surgery Neural Trauma Popp, A. J. Bourke, R. S. Nelson, L. R. Kimelberg, H, K,.Eds. Raven Press New York, 1979 p. 347, byBourke, R. S. Kimelberg, H, K. Daze, M. A. in BrainRes. 1978, 154, 196, and by Bourke, R. S. Kimelberg,H. K, Nelson, L. R. in Brain Res. 1976, 105, 09. This method constitutes a rapid and accurate method of determining the intrinsic chloride inhibitory properties of the compounds of the invention in the target tissue. The second assay method involves the in vitro primary rat astrocyte assay. The method has been described by Kimelberg, H. K. Biddlecome, S. Bourke, R. S. in Brain Res. 1979, 173, 111, by Kiiilberg, H.K. Bowman, c. Biddlecome, S. Bourke,R.S., in Brain Res. 1979, 177, 533, and by Kimelberg,H.K. Hirata, H. in Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1981, 7, 698. This method is used to confirm the chloride transport inhibiting properties of the compounds in the pure target cells, the astrocytes. The third assay method, the in vivo cat head injury assay has been described by Nelson, L.R. Bourke, R.S. Popp, A.J. Cragoe, E.J. Jr. Signorelli, A. Foster, V. V. Creel, in Marshall,L. P, Shapiro, H.M. Smith, R.W. In Seminars inNeurological Surgery Neural Trauma Popp, A.J. Bourke, R.S. Nelson, L. R. Kimelberg, H.K., Eds. Raven Press New York, 1979 p. 297. This assay consists of a highly relevant brain injury in cats which is achieved by the delivery of rapid repetitive accelerationdeceleration impulses to the animal s head followed by exposure of the animals to a period of hypoxias The experimental conditions of the assay can be adjusted so that the mortality of the control animals falls in the range of about 25 to 75e. Then, the effect of the administration of compounds of this invention in reducing the mortality over that of the control animals in concurrent experiments can be demonstrated. Using the assays described supra, compounds of this invention exhibit marked activity both in vitro and in vivo. For example, in the in vitro assays compounds of Formula I and I G inhibit chloride transport by 50 at concentrations as low as 10 9 to 10 10 molar and lower. Likewise in the in vivo assay compound of Formula I or I G reduce the mortality due to head injury by statistically significant values as compared to control animals. The following examples are included to illustrate the preparation of representative compounds of Formula I and I G and representative dosage forms of these compounds.
