# Rubber skim stock with improved adhesion to a brass coated metal member.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a method, a rubber skim stock and a product containing the skim stock having im proved adhesion between a metal member and contiguous rubber skim stock. The invention lies in the discovery that improved rubber to metal adhesion can be obtained by adding to an otherwise conventional rubber skim stock composition appropriate amounts of a tetracarboxylic dianhydride. The method of this invention comprises the steps of mixing a tetracarboxylic dianhydride into a rubber compo sition, bringing this composition into contiguous relation ship with a metal member in an unvulcanized product and vulcanizing the product to yield the end product.
