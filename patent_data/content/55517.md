# Non polarizable bioelectrode.

## Abstract
A non polarizable electrode is disclosed comprising a metallic sensing element in contact with an electrolyte gel or other conformable, electrically conductive skin interfacing material containing dissolved electrolyte salt and an oxidiz ing agent. The oxidizing agent reduces the metal on the surface of the sensing element to a metal cation which reacts with the anion of the electrolyte salt to produce an insoluble compound which is deposited on the sensing element to render it non polarizable. The preferred embodiment of the invention relates to silver silver chloride electrodes.
