# Hitch control system for an agricultural vehicle.

## Abstract
Clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of a shaft 14 and lever 26 fixed thereto lower and raise a three point hitch via a conventional rockshaft valve and lift cylinder. Working depth of an implement on the hitch is set manually by a frictionally restrained lever 20 coupled to the lever 26 by a link 30 which is pivoted 32 on the lever 20 and coupled to the lever 26 by a slot 36 engaging a pin 28 on the lever 26 . A bellows actuator 42 has a rod 64 which is urged to the left by a spring 68 and to the right by a differential pressure across a water pump 11 of the tractor engine 10 . If the engine labours and its speed drops, the differential pressure falls, the rod 64 moves to the left, pushes the link 30 clockwise about its pivot 32 and therefore pushes the lever 26 and shaft 14 anticlockwise to raise the hitch. By thus using coolant pressure as a measure of engine speed a simple means of implementing draft load control is provided.
