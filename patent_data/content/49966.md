## Description
This invention relates to a process for the polymerization of vinyl monomers, and in particular to a process for the polymerization of vinyl chloride using a polymerization initiator comprising a diperester of oxalic acid, and to polymers prepared according to the process of the invention. It is known in the art to polymerize vinyl monomers using free radicals generated from organic peroxides to initiate the reaction. However, not all organic peroxides are effective initiators for the polymerization of all vinyl monomers. For example, in United States Patent 3,341,507, Guillet et al teach that peroxydicarboxylic acid esters such as di tertbutyl peroxyoxalate are also ineffective in the practice of this invention the disclosed invention comprising the polymerization of vinyl monomers at a temperature in the range from 600 to 2500C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere to 50,000 psi. Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain di esters of diperoxyoxalic acid are very effective initiators for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer vim . Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of a vinyl chloride polymer which process comprises the homo or copolymerization of vinyl chloride at a temperature in the range of from 250 to SO0C and a pressure in the range of from 1 to 20 2 kg cm in the presence of from 0.01 to 2 , by weight of the monomer, of a diestefir of diperoxyoxalic acid of formula IEMI1.1 wherein RÚ and Rê are independently chosen from C1 to C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl and benzyl and at least one of R and 2P is a secondary alkyl group, a tertiary alkyl group or a benzyl group. 2 Suitable values for R and R include straight chain C1 to C6 alkyl, branched chain C1 to C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl and benzyl. Preferred RÚ and Rê are C1 to C6 alkyl and especially secondary or tertiary C3 toC6 alkyl. A particularly preferred compound of formula I is di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate. The process of the present invention may be applied to the production of vinyl chloride homopolymers or vinyl chloride copolymers containing at least 50 mole percent, and more preferably at least 80 mole percent, of units derived from vinyl chloride monomer. Monomers which may be copolymerized with vinyl chloride monomer include, for example vinyl derivatives such as vinyl bromide, vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, N vinylcarbazole, methyl vinyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether andN vinylpyrrolidone a olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butylene and isobutylene acrylates such as acrylic acid, n butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, n butyl methacrylate and 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate unsaturated nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile unsaturated dicarboxylic acid derivatives such as diallyl maleate, dibutyl maleate, diethyl fumarate, dimethyl itaconate and maleic anhydride triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate and trimethylolpropane, trimethacrylate and mixtures thereof. The polymerization process of the invention may be carried out using any of the operating conditions customarily used for the homo or co polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer. Conventional processes for the preparation of vinyl chloride polymers include bulk polymerization, gas phase polymerization and polymerization in an aqueous medium by suspension or emulsion polymerization techniques. In the process of the present invention, preferably, vinyl chloride monomer is homo or copolymerized using an aqueous suspension process with the aid of one or more suspending agents. Suitable suspending agent s for use in the process of the present invention may be chosen from those conventionally used in the art for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer in aqueous suspension. Such suspending agents include, for example, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate , gelatin, methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymers, and mixtures thereof. A preferred suspending agent for use in the process of the present invention is partially hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate PVAc . The degree of hydrolysis of the currently commercially available PVACs which may be used as suspension agents when the vinyl chloride monomer is polymerized in aqueous suspension according to the process of the present invention may vary within a large range. Usually the degree of hydrolysis of thePVAc is in the range of from 20 to 90 mole t. Preferably the degree of hydrolysis is in the range of from 60 to 90 mole . The partially hydrolysed PVAc may be used on its own as a suspension agent or in combination with a different type of suspension agent. The total amount of suspension agent used in the polymerization may vary widely and is generally between 0.05 and 2.0 by weight of the monomer. The polymerization process of the invention is generally carried outat a temperature in the range of from 250 to 80C and preferably from 300 to 70 C. The pressure at which the polymerization reaction may be carried out ranges from atmospheric pressure to a pressure of 20 kg cm2 but the pressure is preferably below 15 kg cm2. One of the significant advantages of the process of the present invention is that the high order of activity of the compounds of formula I enables the polymerization reaction to be carried out at lower temperatures and or for shorter reaction times than can be achieved using the current commercially available high activity initiators. For example, the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer in aqueous suspension using bis 4 t butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate one of the most active commercially available initiators as initiator under conventional reaction conditions, at a temperature in the range of from 50 700C takes of the order of 120 to 250 minutes for completion.In contrast when vinyl chloride is polymerized according to the process of the invention using di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate a compound of formula I as initiator, under identical reactions, at a temperature of 50 C the reaction takes of the order of only 50 minutes for completion. In view of the teaching of Guillet et al inUnited States Patent 3,341,507, and hereinbefore referred to, it is surprising to find that certain di esters of diperoxyoxalic acid are very effective initiators for the polymerization o vinyl chloride monomer. Moreover, it should be noted that while it might be expected that organic peroxides of low thermal stability, such as the compounds of formula I, would readily decompose to give free radicals, this case of generation of free radicals is not a measure of the usefulness of the compound as an initiator for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer. For example, the half lives of the initiators acetylcyclohexane sulfonyl peroxide ACSP and bis 4tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate BCHP one of the most active commercially available initiators are of the order of 30 minutes and 160 minutes respectively measured in benzene at a temperature of 500 C and therefore it might be expected that ACSP would be a considerably more active faster initiator than BCHP for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer. However, while ACSP begins to polymerize vinyl chloride monomer at a much faster rate than does BCHP, it appears that the ACSP may be rapidly exhausted as the higher rate of polymerization soon decreases.In the final analysis, under the same reaction conditions, a temperature of 50 0C and using the same molar concentration of initiators, ACSP polymerizes vinyl chloride monomer to 75 conversion only of the order of 1.1 times faster than does BCHP. Therefore, it is completely unexpected to find that in the process of the present invention an initiator such as di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate a compound of formula I with an even shorter half life of the order of 20 minutes measured in benzene at 50 C than ACSP polymerizes vinyl chloride monomer to over 80 conversion of the order of at least 2.6 times faster than doesBCHP. The advantages which flow from the process of the present invention enabling the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer to be carried out at lower temperatures than heretofore possible will be evident to those skilled in the art. For example, significant savings in manufacturing costs may be realised by utilizing lower reaction temperatures and or shorter reaction times. Moreover, polymers having improved properties may be obtained by carrying out the polymerization reaction at lower temperatures. Another advantage of the process of the present invention is that the use of initiators of formula I results in the inclusion of 6nly very low levels of initiator residues into the polymer, which may lead to improved polymer properties. For example, when the compounds of formula I decompose to generate the free radicals which initiate the polymerization reaction, the only products formed are the low molecular weight radicals R1O. and R2O. and darbon dioxide. In effect, this means that on a weight for weight basis only very small amounts of material which did not originate from the monomer are incorporated into the polymer. While the process of the present invention is especially advantageous in the low temperature polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer it may also be used to advantage in higher temperature polymerizations using a mixed initiator system. For example, depending on the specific reaction conditions employed, a polymerization reaction according to the process of the present invention which employs a compound of formula I as the only initiator may not go to completion before the initiator is exhausted. If it is desired in the process of the present invention to utilize reaction conditions in which the initiator of formula I may be exhausted before the completion of the polymerization reaction, completion of the reaction can be effected by the use of a mixed initiator system comprising a compound of formula I and one of the less active, slower initiators.Suitable additional initiators may be chosen from those initiators known in the art to be suitable for use in the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer including, for example, lauroyl peroxide, bis 4 tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, dibenzoyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, tert butyl peroxypivalate, azobisisobutyronitrile, azobis 2,4dimethylvaleronitrile, sulfonyl peroxides and the like. The compounds of formula I are highly active initiators for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer which decompose when heated. Moreover, some of the compounds may explode when scratched, rubbed or crushed. As a result it is important that the compounds of formula I be treated with care. Compounds of formula I may be conveniently prepared by the stepwide addition of a suitable hydroperoxides to oxalyl chloride according to the following reaction scheme.EMI7.1 In compounds of formula I wherein R and R2 are the same the reaction may be carried out in one step by reacting one mole of oxalyl chloride with two moles of the appropriate alkyl hydroperoxide. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature below 0 0C in an anhydrous inert solvent such as an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon. A base, for example pyridine, may be added to the reaction mixture to neutralize the hydrogen chloride formed in the reaction. The compound of formula I used as an initiator in the process of the present invention may be prepared as described above and stored, preferably at a low temperature, until ready for use. Alternatively, if minimum handling and storage of the initiator is desired, the compound of formula I may be prepared in an adjacent reaction vessel and be transferred to the polymerization reaction vessel before the polymerization reaction is begun or the compound of formula I may be prepared in situ in the polymerization vessel. The invention is now illustrated by the following non limiting E amples. Example 1Preparation of di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate A mixture of tert butyl hydroperoxide 90 parts , pyridine 80 parts and anhydrous pentane 1000 parts was cooled to a temperature of 10 C. A solution of oxalyl chloride 64 parts and anhydrous pentane 500 parts was added dropwise to the stirred cold mixture over a period of 40 minutes, the reaction mixture being maintained at a temperature below 0 0C throughout the addition. The pyridinium chloride was collected by filtration and washed with cold pentane.The combined filtrates were cooled in a dry ice acetone bath and the product crystallised. The crystalline di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate was collected by filtration, moistened with anhydrous pentane and stored at a temperature below 20 0C.

The vessel was heated to the reaction temperature of 50 C and maintained at that temperature until the pressure in the reaction vessel dropped indicating completion of the reaction, a period of 49 minutes.

Comparative Examples A, B, C and D In order to compare the effectiveness of the polymerization process of the invention to prior art polymerization processes the general reaction procedure described in Examples 7 to 14 was repeated replacing the polymerization initiator di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate with either bis 4 tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate BCHP one of the most active commercially available initiators for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer or a mixture of BCHP and lauroyl peroxide LP . The reaction conditions are detailed in Table 4 below and the polymer properties are detailed in Table 5 below. The Comparative Examples show that the prior art processes for the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer using BCHP or BCHP and LP as initiators give poly vinyl chloride having comparable properties with the polymer produced by the process of the present invention. However, it is clear that the time required for the completion of the prior art polymerization process is considerably longer than the time required for the completion of the polymerization process of the present invention.For example, when vinyl chloride monomer 2.5 kg was polymerized at a temperature of 510C using BCHP 37 it moles as initiator the reaction time to pressure drop was 120 min Comparative Example B,Table 4 whereas when the same amount of vinyl chloride monomer was polymerized under the same conditions using di tert butyl diperoxyoxalate 29 mmoles as initiator the reaction time to pressure drop was only 47 minutes Example 11, Table 2 .
