# Flue gas reheat system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reheating stack gases leaving a plurality of scrubbers 34, 36 which uses water within an associated steam generator 12 as the heating source. A heat exchanger 46 receives heat from the boiler water transferring it to a low pressure fluid which is circulated through heat exchange sur faces 38,40 downstream of each of the scrubbers 34,36 . The flow of the high pressure boiler water is controlled in response to a temperature 176 of the low pressure fluid thereby providing a means for minimizing the flow and return temperature of the high pressure water. The high pressure water is taken from a circulating pump discharge 24 and returned to the circulating pump suction 12 .
