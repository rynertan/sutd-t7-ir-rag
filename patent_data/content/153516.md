# Safety valve.

## Abstract
A safety valve has a housing 1 containing a valve member 2 having a resilient sealing gasket 9 which is biased against a seat 8 by a spring 3 . To prevent the resilient gasket 9 being blown out or otherwise damaged by high pressure fluid flowing through the valve from an inlet 5 to an outlet 7 , the gasket 9 is surrounded by a sleeve 10 having an inwardly directed flange 13 . The sleeve 10 is movable upwards and downwards on the member 2 within limits determined by a pin 11 fitting in oversized holes in the sleeve 10 and by engagement of the top of the sleeve with a shoulder 22 on the valve member. The sleeve 1 does not therefore impede seating of the gasket 9 on the seat 8 and also moves down to protect the gasket 9 still further when the valve opens.
