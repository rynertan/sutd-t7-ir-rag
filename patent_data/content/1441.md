# A method for defining the spatial location of object surface points.

## Abstract
In a method for defining the spatial location of points comprising an object surface, radiant energy is projected onto the object 10 in successive steps with the energy projected in each step having a unique change in intensity with distance along an axis TA extending transversely of the projection field. The spatial locations of surface points P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄ are derived by comparison of reflected intensity information derived from records 20 of the object so irradiated and predetermined patterns derived in accordance with the intensity changes with transverse distance in the respective energy projections.
