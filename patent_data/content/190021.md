# Heat foamable crosslinked propylene resin composition.

## Abstract
A heat foamable crosslinked propylene resin composi tion in the form of a melt shaped structure comprising 1 100 parts by weight of a crosslinked propylene resin composition obtained by mixing at least four components composed of A a propylene resin containing 0 to 30 mole of an alpha olefin other than propylene and having a melt flow rate MFR , determined by ASTM D1238L, of 0.1 to 50 g 10 min., B an olefin resin which is a propylene random copolymer resin B1 composed of 55 to 85 mole of propylene and 15 to 45 mole of an alpha olefin with 4 to 20 carbon atoms and having an amount of heat of crystal fusion, determined by thermal analysis on a differential scanning calorimeter, of 25 to 70 joules g and a melt flow rate MFR , determined by ASTM D1238L, of 0.05 to 20 g 10 min. or a 1 butene homo polymer or a 1 butene random copolymer resin B2 composed of 70 to 100 mole of 1 butene and 0 to 30 mole of an alpha olefin having 2, 3 or 5 to 20 carbon atoms and having an amount of heat of crystal fusion, determined by thermal analysis on a differential scanning calorimeter of 20 to 70 joules g and a melt flow rate MFR , determined by ASTM D1238L, of 0.05 to 50 g 10 min., 0.05 to 0.5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the resins A and B combined, of a radical initiator C and 0.1 to 1 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the resins A and B combined, of D a crosslinking agent at a tempera ture at which the radical initiator decomposes to form the cross linked propylene resin 1 and 2 0.5 to 5 parts by weight of a thermally decomposable blowing agent.
