# Luggage case and vehicle rack therefor.

## Abstract
A luggage case 10 and a vehicle mounted luggage rack 11 have parts which cooperate so that the case 10 can be rapidly secured to or disengaged from the rack. The luggage case has one or more grooves 13 and 14 in its sidewall 15. First and second mutually spaced mounting apparatus 20 and 24 are affixed to the same sidewall 15. The vehicle mounted luggage rack 11 includes support bars 32 which fit in the grooves 13 and 14 of the case. First retention apparatus 34 on the rack 11 has an open groove 39 into which the first luggage case mounting apparatus 20 can be inserted. Second retention apparatus 42 is located on the rack spaced from the first and has a spring loaded member 59 for resiliently receiving the luggage case second mount ing apparatus 24. The spacing and location of the various parts on the case and rack are such as to enable them to be simulta neously cooperatively engaged. In this manner, the luggage case is secured to the rack and prevented from moving in any direction. A key operated lock 56 guards against theft of the case from the rack.
