# Read only memory device.

## Abstract
A read only memory device comprising first and second memory cell areas 6 1 and 6 2 is disclosed. In the first memory cell 6 1 area, the presence or absence of a transistor repre sents the binary data 0 or 1 , while, in the second memory cell 6 2 area, the presence or absence of a connection for connecting a transistor to one of bit lines BL₀ to BL₃ repre sents the binary data 0 or 1 .
