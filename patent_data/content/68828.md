# Integrated circuit comprising passive isolation regions.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes therein a plurality of se miconductor elements 10 . First passive isolation regions 11 formed parallel to a buried layer 15 and second passive isola tion regions 12 formed perpendicularly thereto serve to isola te the semiconductor elements from one another. The second passive isolation regions are deepened adjacent to locations 25 at which they intersect the first passive isolation region whereby any tendency for latchup to occur in the device is re duced.
