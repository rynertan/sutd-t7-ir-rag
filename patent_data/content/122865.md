# Polymers with polymeric antioxidants prepared from diphenylamine and dialkylalkenylbenzene or dihydroxyalkylbenzene.

## Abstract
A class of novel polymeric diphenylamine compounds are used to provide antioxidant protection to oxidizable polymers. In particular, the polymeric reaction products of diphenylamine and 1,4 diisopropenylbenzene are used in acrylonitrile butadiene and styrene butadiene rubbers to pro tect these rubbers in high temperature, oxidative working environments.
