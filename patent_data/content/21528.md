# Process for the selective hydrogenation of triglyceride oils and products so obtained.

## Abstract
Triglyceride oils, which contain besides fatty acids having two double bonds, fatty acids having more than two double bonds, are hydrogenated using palladium, platinum, rhodium and or iridium as a catalyst, the catalyst being treated with dry ammonia. The hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature of at least 100 C. The hydrogenation progresses in a particularly selective manner. On using, for instance, soya bean oil, which contains about 55 of linoleic acid and 7 of linolenic acid, the amount of linolenic acid can be reduced to 2 , whereby more than 45 of linoleic acid is retained in the hydrogenated product. In case the catalyst is not treated, said amount is only about 35 .
