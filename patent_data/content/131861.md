# 2 Substituted 3 sulfonamidepyridine compounds, process for preparing and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.

## Abstract
2 substituted 3 sulfonamidepyridine compounds of the formula CHEM are disclosed wherein R1 and R2 represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms or else form a five membered ring with two substituents R5R6 ldurule , wherein R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen atoms, lower alkyl groups, phenyl or heteroaryl groups, which substitution is optional, and X represents an oxygen atom or a rdurule N R7 group, R7 being a C1 C6 alkyl group preferably branched out, e.g., with isopropyl, isobutyl, t butyl, isoamyl, t amyl, neopentyl groups. Those compounds are useful as hypotensives and as alpha and beta adrenergic blocking drugs as well as intermediates in the synthesis of other pharmacologically active pyridines. A process for preparing said derivatives is also described.
