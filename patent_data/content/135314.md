# Electrolytic cell module.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell of the type to which electrolyte is continuously charged and from which a product or products of electrolysis is or are continuously removed, the electroly tic cell being associated in close proximity with an item or items of apparatus in which electrolyte may be treated prior to charging to the electrolytic cell and or in which a product or products of electrolysis may be treated after removal from the electrolytic cell. Also, a plurality of such electrolytic cells and items of apparatus. Electrolyte may be purified in the items of apparatus associated in close proximity with the electrolytic cells prior to charging to the cells, and the product streams from the cells may be treated in the items of apparatus prior to combining the product streams.
