# Machine tool.

## Abstract
A machine tool consisting of a portal stand com prising a number of, preferably four, screw pillars 2 . A moveable yoke 6 is driven and guided along the screw pillars by means of nuts 7 preferably roller nuts. Tools, machining devices or the like can be attached to the yoke. The nuts are driven simultaneously by a driv ing means 8 by way of a drive shaft 9 extending therefrom. A very good parallel holding of the yoke 6 is achieved despite uneven loads. When the power de mand is high, for example during heavy pressings, a help cylinder 12 is needed for driving, the piston rod 13 of which is fixed to the yoke 6 .
