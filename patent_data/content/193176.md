## Description
This invention is directed to a laminate formed from a layer of a polyarylate sheet and a certain layer of a sheet of an aromatic polycarbonate, a thermoplastic polyester, or blends of these polymers. Aromatic polycarbonates, especially those formed from bisphenol A and carbonyl chloride, and polyesters, such as poly ethylene terephthalate , are extensively used in glazing applications. That is, sheets made from these resins are used as windows, films, sky lights, etc. However, in long term exposure to ultraviolet UV light, the sheets become hazy. The haze is a micro cracking of the surface. This crazing results in a loss of mechanical properties and light transmission. A solution to this problem has been to apply coatings to the sheets. The coating is helpful to some extent since it is able to protect the sheet against haze for a longer period of time than an uncoated sheet. However, crazing is still a problem. Also, coating is expensive since special equipment is needed, and contained in the casting polymer are relatively large quantities of expensive UV absorbers. Further, solvent contained in the coating must be evaporated. Polyarylates are polyesters derived from a dihydric phenol, particularly bisphenol A and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. The polyarylates are high temperature, high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of mechanical properties and are used to mold a variety of articles. It is known that upon exposure to ultraviolet light polyarylates undergo the Photo Fries rearrangement. Korshak et al in Synthesis and Properties of Self Protecting Polyarylates, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A 1, Vol. 7, pages 157 to 172 1969 describe a mechanism to explain what happens when polyarylates are exposed to UV light. The authors propose that polyarylates undergo the Photo Fries rearrangement resulting in carbonyl and hydroxyl groups ortho to one another, structurally similar to o hydroxybenzophenones which are known light absorbers. Thus, the polyarylates have increased photostability in the bulk of the material. Cohen et al in Transparent Ultraviolet Barrier Coatings, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A 1, Vol. 9, pages 3263 to 3299 1971 describe a number of phenyl polyesters, including polyarylates, which were synthesized to furnish molecules whose backbones rearrange under UV light to an o hydroxybenzophenone structure. This Photo Fries rearrangement produced ultraviolet opacity in an irradiated film while maintaining visual transparency. Thin coatings of these polyesters completely protect substrates ordinarily sensitive to ultraviolet light. The authors state that spectroscopic analysis of various rearranged films and coatings showed that the o hydroxybenzophenone polymer formed was concentrated at the irradiated surface of the original polyester coating as a skin . Such a skin, formed in situ during the irradiation, functioned to protect both the original polyester coating as well as the coated substrate from degredation by ultraviolet irradiation. Furthermore, a significant healing mechanism appeared inherent in the coatings, for as the exposed skin ultimately degraded under extended ultraviolet irradiation, more of the underlying polyester layer apparently rearranged to compensate for the loss. Thus, the clear coating functioned both as a protective skin and a rearrangeable reservoir. US A 3,492,261 describes film forming solutions of rearrangeable aromatic polyesters which are the polymeric reaction product of an aromatic dihydric compound and an aromatic dicarboxylic compound. It is stated in this patent that the preferred dihydric compounds are the ester derivatives of 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentanoic acid. The solutions of aromatic polyesters can be coated onto a substrate and dried to transparent films, are capable of absorbing ultraviolet light and undergo rearrangement in the presence thereof to form a transparent compound which is stable to and will act as a barrier to ultraviolet light. US A 3,503,779 discloses substrates which are coated with rearrangeable aromatic polyesters which are the polymeric reaction product of an aromatic dihydric compound and an aromatic dicarboxylic compound. The outer exposed surface of the aromatic polyester coatings rearrange under the influence of ultraviolet light to form a new transparent compound which is stable to and will act as a barrier to ultraviolet light. US A 3,444,129 discloses rearrangeable aromatic polyesters which are the polymeric reaction product of an aromatic dihydric compound, and an aromatic dicarboxylic compound. The preferred dihydric compound is stated to be the ester derivatives of 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentanoic acid. The rearrangeable aromatic polyesters are useful as ultraviolet light barriers. US A 3,460,961 describes substrates which are protected with a transparent aromatic polyester coating of two contiguous superposed layers. The aromatic polyester compounds are the reaction product of an aromatic dihydric compound and an aromatic dicarboxylic compound. The aromatic polyester coating undergoes rearrangement in the presence of ultraviolet light to form a transparent compound which is stable to and acts as a barrier to ultraviolet light. However, in all of these references coatings are being utilized which, as discussed above, require expensive solvent coating equipment and require evaporation of a solvent. US A 4503121 describes laminate compositions comprising a polyarylate, or blends thereof, derived from a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid which is laminated upon the surface of a poly aryl ether , particularly polysulfone. It is stated therein that excellent protection of the polysulfone against degradation resulting from prolonged UV exposure is afforded by laminating the polyarylate upon its surface. Furthermore, GB A 2 019 780 discloses a multilayered hollow container comprising at least one layer of thermoplastic polyester and at least one layer of polycarbonate, said layers being laminated without any adhesive. It has been found that a sheet made from an aromatic polycarbonate or a thermoplastic polyester, or combinations of these polymers can be protected from ultraviolet light by laminating thereon a sheet made from a polymer which undergoes a Photo Fries rearrangement, i.e., a polyarylate, onto one or both of its surfaces. As compared to the prior art methods which utilize a coating to protect a substrate against UV light, the just described procedure does not have the disadvantages of solvent removal. Also, this provides permanent protection to the underlying surface as compared to a coating which can wear off. The combination of polyarylate laminated onto polycarbonate or polyester is unique since excellent adhesion is observed and scrap can be reused without affecting the transparency of the laminated product. This allows for a unique and important characteristic reuse of scrap which is the essence of this invention. Specifically, the present invention provides a laminate comprising a layer a of polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, said layer being in laminar contact with a layer b of a polymer selected from i a thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonate, ii a thermoplastic polyester derived from an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diol, or mixtures thereof and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and iii mixtures of the polycarbonate and polyester, wherein said layer b incorporates polyarylate as defined for use in said layer a . A preferred laminate comprises a layer a of a polyarylate derived from a bisphenol A and isophthalic and or terephthalic acid sheet and a layer b containing a polycarbonate derived from bisphenol A and phosgene and or a polyester such as poly ethylene terephthalate . The polyarylate sheet may be laminated to one or both sides of the polycarbonate and or polyester sheet b . The laminates of this invention can be from 0.76mm 30 mils to 1.27cm 1 2 inch thick, preferably from 1.02 to 2.29mm 40 to 90 mils thick. The sheets which form the laminates are from 0.025mm to 2.5mm 1 mil to 100 mils , preferably from 0.051mm to 0.25mm 2 to 10 mils thick for the polyarylate and from 0.051mm to 1.27cm 2 mils to 1 2 inch , preferably from 1.27mm to 2.03mm 50 to 80 mils thick for the polycarbonate and or polyester layer 6 The polyarylates which are suitable for use in this invention are derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and have preferably a reduced viscosity of from 0.4 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.6 to 0.8 dl gm, as measured in chloroform 0.5 g 100ml chloroform or other suitable solvent at 25 C. A particularly desirable dihydric phenol is of the following formula wherein Y is independently selected from, hydrogen, alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chlorine or bromine, each a, independently, has a value of from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R₁ is a divalent saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, particularly an alkylene or alkylidene radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkylidene or cycloalkylene radical having up to and including 9 carbon atoms, O, CO, SO₂, or S. The dihydric phenols may be used individually or in combination. The dihydric phenols that may be used in this invention include the following The aromatic dicarboxylic acids that may be used in this invention include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, any of the naphthalene dicarboxylic acids and mixtures thereof, as well as alkyl substituted homologs of these carboxylic acids, wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and acids containing other inert substituents, such as halides, alkyl or aryl ethers, and the like. Acetoxybenzoic acid can also be used. Preferably, mixtures of isophthalic and terephthalic acids are used. The isophthalic acid to terephthalic acid ratio in the mixture is 0 100 to 100 0, while the most preferred acid ratio is 75 25 to 50 50. Also, from 0.5 to 20 percent of aliphatic diacids containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, and the like may be additionally used in the polymerization reaction. The polyarylates of the present invention can be prepared by any of the well known prior art polyester forming reactions, such as the reaction of the acid chlorides of the aromatic dicarboxylic acids with the dihydric phenols the reaction of the diaryl esters of the aromatic dicarboxylic acids with the dihydric phenols or the reaction of the aromatic diacids with diester derivatives of the dihydric phenol. These processes are described in, for example, US A 3,317,464 3,948,856 3,780,148 3,824,213 and 3,133,898. The polyarylates are preferably prepared by the process as set forth in US A 4,321,355. This process comprises the following steps The acid anhydride suitably is derived from an acid containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The preferred acid anhydride is acetic anhydride. The dihydric phenol is described above. Generally, the dihydric phenol reacts with the acid anhydride under conventional esterification conditions to form the dihydric phenol diester. The reaction may take place in the presence or absence of a solvent. Additionally, the reaction may be conducted in the presence of a conventional esterification catalyst or in the absence thereof. The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates that can be employed herein are homopolymers and copolymers and mixtures thereof, which have an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.4 to 1.0 dl. g. as measured in methylene chloride at 25 C. The polycarbonates are prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor. Typical of some of the dihydric phenols that may be employed are bisphenol A, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 , 5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane, and the like. Other dihydric phenols of the bisphenol type are described in, for example, US A 2,999,835, 3,028,365 and 3,334,154. It is, of course, possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with hydroxy or acid terminated polyesters. The carbonate precursor may be either a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester, or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl bromide, carbonyl chloride and mixtures thereof. Typical of the carbonate esters which may be employed herein are diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates, such as di chlorophenyl carbonate or di bromophenyl carbonate, di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, di naphthyl carbonate, or di chloronaphthyl carbonate, or mixtures thereof. The haloformates suitable for use herein include bis haloformates of dihydric phenols, for example, bischloroformates of bisphenol A or of hydroquinone, or of glycols, for example, bishaloformates of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol or polyethylene glycol. While other carbonate precursors will be apparent to those skilled in the art, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene, is preferred. The aromatic polycarbonate polymers may be prepared by methods well known in the art by using phosgene or a haloformate and by employing a molecular weight regulator, an acid acceptor and a catalyst. The molecular weight regulators which can be employed in carrying out the process include monohydric phenols, such as phenol, para tertiary butylphenol, para bromophenol and primary and secondary amines. Preferably, a phenol is employed as the molecular weight regulator. A suitable acid acceptor may be either an organic or an inorganic acid acceptor. A suitable organic acid acceptor is a tertiary amine and includes materials, such as pyridine, triethylamine, dimethylaniline and tributylamine. The inorganic acid acceptor may be one which can be either a hydroxide, a carbonate, a bicarbonate, or a phosphate of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. The catalysts which are employed herein can be any of the suitable catalysts that aid the polymerization of, for example, bisphenol A with phosgene. Suitable catalysts include tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, tripropylamine, N,N dimethylaniline, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as tetraethylammonium bromide, cetyl triethyl ammonium bromide, tetra n heptylammonium iodide, and quaternary phosphonium compounds, such as n butyltriphenyl phosphonium bromide and methyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide. The polycarbonates can be prepared in a one phase homogeneous solution or a two phase interfacial system when phosgene, or a haloformate are used. Bulk reactions are possible when the diarylcarbonate precursors are used. Also, aromatic polyester carbonates may be used. These are described in, for example, US A 3,169,121. The preferred polyester carbonate results from the condensation of phosgene, terephthaloyl chloride, isophthaloyl chloride with bisphenol A and a small amount of p tert butylphenol. The polyesters which are suitable for use herein are derived from an aliphatic or cyloaliphatic diol, or mixtures thereof, containing preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid. The polyesters which are derived from an aliphatic diol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid have repeating units of the following general formula wherein n is an integer of from 2 to 10. The preferred polyester is poly ethylene terephthalate . Also contemplated herein are the above polyesters with minor amounts, e.g., from 0.5 to 2 percent by weight, of units derived from aliphatic acids and or aliphatic polyols, to form copolyesters. The aliphatic polyols include glycols, such as poly ethylene glycol . These can be made following the teachings of, for example, US A 2,465,319 and 3,047,539. The polyesters which are derived from a cycloaliphatic diol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid are prepared by condensing either the cis or trans isomer or mixtures thereof of, for example, 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid so as to produce a polyester having recurring units of the following formula wherein the cyclohexane ring is selected from the cis and trans isomers thereof and R₂ represents an aryl radical containing 6 to 20 carbon atoms and which is the decarboxylated residue derived from an aromatic dicarboxylic acid. Examples of aromatic dicarboxylic acids indicated by R₂ in formula II, are isophthalic or terephthalic acid, 1,2 di p carboxyphenyl ethane, 4,4 dicarboxydiphenyl ether, and mixtures of these. All of these acids contain at least one aromatic nucleus. Fused rings can also be present, such as in 1,4 or 1,5 naphthalenedicarboxylic acids. The preferred dicarboxylic acids are terephthalic acid or a mixture of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. A preferred polyester may be derived from the reaction of either the cis or trans isomer or a mixture thereof of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol with a mixture of isophthalic and terephthalic acids. These polyesters have repeating units of the formula Another preferred polyester is a copolyester derived from a cyclohexane dimethanol, an alkylene glycol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid. These copolyesters are prepared by condensing either the cis or trans isomer or mixtures thereof of, for example, 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and an alkylene glycol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid so as to produce a copolyester having repeating units of the following formula wherein the cyclohexane ring is selected from the cis and trans isomers thereof, R₂ is as previously defined, n is an integer of 2 to 10, the b units comprise from 10 to 90 percent by weight and the c units comprise from 10 to 90 percent by weight. The preferred copolyester may be derived from the reaction of either the cis or trans isomer or mixtures thereof of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid in a molar ratio of 1 2 3. These copolyesters have repeating units of the following formula wherein d can be 10 to 10,000. Block as well as random copolymers are possible. The polyester as described herein are either commercially available or can be produced by methods well known in the art, such as those set forth in, for example, US A 2,901,466. The polyesters used herein have preferably an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.4 to 2.0 dl g. as measured in a 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane mixture or similar solvent at 23 to 30 C. The polyarylate may be blended with other polymers including polycarbonates and or polyesters. The polycarbonate and or polyester may be blended with each other or with other polymers apart from the polyarylate . Other additives may be used with the polymers such as stabilizers, flame retardants, and the like. Since the primary use of the laminate is for glazing applications which are transparent, only those additives are generally used which maintain the transparency of the laminate. However, if an application is desired where transparency is not needed, such as certain types of solar collectors, then any desired additive may be used. The thermoplastic polymer, and one or more optional additives are generally compounded in an extruder. The compounding is carried out at temperature of from 200 C to 400 C. The compounded material may be pelletized by conventional techniques. The compounded material is extruded into a sheet and then formed into a laminate. Alternatively, the thermoplastic polymer either alone or in combination with other materials may be fed in particulate form such as pellets, granules, particles, powders, and the like into an extruder which extrudes the material into a laminate. The extruders which are used to form the laminate are well known in the art. Typically, the extruder may be a 6.35cm 2 1 2 inch Davis Standard extruder containing an extruder screw with a length to diameter ratio of 24 to 1. The laminate may be prepared by the procedure and using the apparatus as described in US A 3,557,265. In the method of said patent, film or sheet having a plurality of layers is formed by deforming a flowing stream having layers of diverse thermoplastic material wherein the cross sectional configuration of the plurality of flowing streams is altered by reducing the dimension of the stream in a direction generally perpendicular to the interfaces between the individual streams and by increasing the dimension of the stream in a direction generally parallel to the interface to provide a sheet having a laminar structure. In another method two or more previously extruded sheets are brought together under pressure and temperature conditions or in the presence of adhesives in order to obtain adherence of the sheets to one another. Coextrusion offers the least expensive means of preparing the laminate. Within coextrusion, three different techniques are most often employed. In one of these techniques, two or more sheets are extruded from separate extruders through separate sheet dies into contact with one another while still hot and then passed through a single set of rollers or another extrusion die and down a single sheet line. Another coextrusion technique employs an adaptor or other means of bringing two or more different plastic materials from two or more extruders into contact with one another prior to their passage through an extrusion die. A further coextrusion technique is where two or more polymer melts meet in an extrusion die to form a laminate. Coextrusion is the preferred technique for forming the laminates of this invention. The laminate may be formed into a shaped article such as a lens, a globe, and the like. If the laminate is to be used as a window, the laminate may be coated with a mar resistant coating.
