## Description
The present invention relates to apparatus for cleaning the cargo holds of ships. In particular, the invention relates to apparatus for cleaning residue from the floor and side walls of cargo holds and removing the residue from the hold. The cleaning of residue from the holds of ocean going vessels has presented considerable problems in the past. Prior systems for cleaning such residue from cargo holds have consisted fundamentally of devices for washing or scraping the residue from the hold walls, such systems being disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,163,455 and 3,937,162.But the system of the 455 patent comprises a fixed support post which must be mounted in the hold and on which a cleaning vehicle is vertically transported.While the apparatus of the 162 patent is deckmounted, it is capable of only limited movement.Furthermore, both of these prior systems provide only a means for washing or scraping the side walls of the hold. No means is provided for conveniently cleaning the floor of the hold, nor is any means provided for removing from the hold material which is flushed or scoured from the side walls. The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for cleaning the cargo holds of vessels, which apparatus avoids the disadvantages of prior systems while affording additional structural and operat ing advantages. More specifically, the invention provides apparatus for cleaning the cargo hold of a ship comprising a frame adapted to be mounted on the associated ship for movement with respect thereto, support means carried by the frame and movable with respect thereto into and throughout all portions of the cargo hold, motive means coupled to the support means for effecting movement thereof, an inlet nozzle carried by the support means and movable therewith, and means for coupling the inlet nozzle to an associated suction pump for removing material from the cargo hold. Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a fragmentary top plan view of the deck of a ship illustrating the cleaning apparatus constructed in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention mounted in position above a cargo hold to be cleaned FIG. 2 is a fragmentary view in vertical section through the hull of the ship, taken along the line 2 2 in FIG. 1, and illustrating the cleaning apparatus in side elevation, with the support arm extended down into the cargo hold FIG. 3 is an end elevational view taken along the line 3 3 in FIG. 2 FIG. 4 is an end elevational view taken along the line 4 4 in FIG. 2 FIG. 5 is a fragmentary top plan view of the left hand end of a cleaning apparatus constructed in accordance with and embodying the features of a second embodiment of the present invention FIG. 6 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the cleaning apparatus illustrated in FIG. 5 and, FIG. 7 is an end elevational view of the cleaning apparatus of FIG. 5, and viewed from the left hand end thereof. Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is illustrated a cargo ship or vessel, generally designated by the numeral 10, which has a hull 11 and a deck 12. Formed in the hull 11 beneath the deck 12 is a plurality of cargo holds, one of which is illustrated and is generally designated by the numeral 15, the holds 15 being separated by bulkheads. A cargo hold 15 is illustrated as being of the hopper bottom type and the vessel 10 will typically be provided with unloading or discharge apparatus not shown disposed beneath the cargo holds 15 for discharging the lading therefrom, all in a well known manner. The cargo hold 15 is provided with vertical side walls 13, integral at the upper end thereof with inwardly and upwardly sloping top walls 14 and at the lower end thereof with inwardly and downwardly sloping bottom walls 16.Downwardly sloping bottom walls 17 are provided centrally of the cargo hold 15 for dividing it into two hopper sections. The sloping walls 16 and 17 cooperate to define bottom outlets for the cargo hold 15. The inner edges of the top walls 14 cooperate to define a rectangular hatch opening at the top of the carbo hold 15, this opening being provided with upstanding vertical flanges 18 along the fore and aft edges thereof and downwardly and inwardly sloping flanges 19 along the port and starboard edges thereof.A suitable hatch cover not shown may be mounted on the rim formed by the flanges 18 and 19. While the cargo hold 15 has been illustrated as extending continuously across the width of the vessel 10, it will be appreciated that the hopper sections of the cargo hold 15 could be separated by a vertical partition along the center line of the vessel 10. Furthermore, while a hopper type cargo hold 15 has been illustrated, it will be appreciated that the present invention is suitable for use with other types of cargo or tanker holds. Mounted on the deck 12 of the vessel 10 is a cleaning vehicle, generally designated by the numeral 20, constructed in accordance with and embodying the features of the present invention. The cleaning vehicle 20 includes a frame, generally designated by the numeral 1, which includes a pair of parallel beams 22 and 24 disposed substantially horizontally and extending laterally of the vessel 10 and spaced apart longitudinally thereof. The beam 22 has the opposite ends thereof respectively secured to vertical posts 23 and the beam 24 has the opposite ends thereof respectively secured to posts 25, the posts 23 and 25 being in turn secured together by connecting members 26 to form a rigid frame which is dimensioned to span the cargo hold 15 laterally of the vessel 10. The lower ends of the posts 23 and 25 are fixedly secured to two carriages 30, each provided with flanged wheels for rolling engagement with rails 32 mounted on the deck 12 respectively adjacent to the opposite sides of the vessel 10 and extending lengthwise thereof. Preferably, the wheels 31 are coupled to a chain drive mechanism and associated power source not shown , whereby the frame 21 is self propelled for movement longitudinally of the vessel 10. However, it will be appreciated that other types of drive means could be utilized for moving the cleaning vehicle 20 along the rails 32. Mounted on the frame 21 at the left hand end thereof, as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 2, is a vacuum or suction pump 33 communicating with a collection hopper 34 disposed therebelow and with one end of an inlet hose 35. The hose 35 is a flexible and is wound on a reel 36 via a hub coupling 37, the reed 36 being rotatably mounted on the frame 21 and driven by a suitable drive means such as a spring motor 38.Also mounted on the carriage 30 adjacent to the reel 36 is a cable reel 39 on which a length of electric cable may be wound. The electric cable may be connected to a suitable source of electric power on the vessel 10, the cable being wound on and unwound from the reel 39 as the cleaning vehicle 20. moves back and forth along the deck 12 of the vessel 10. Mounted on the carriage 30 at the righthand end of the frame 21, as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 2, is a control platform 40 on which is mounted a control panel 41. In use, an operator stands on the control platform 40 and operates the cleaning vehicle 20 by use of the control panel 41. Also mounted on the same carriage 30 is an electric motor 42 which is coupled to the electric power source via the cable wound on the reel 39. The electric motor 42 is in turn coupled to a hydraulic pump not.shown of a hydraulic system for powering other portions of the cleaning vehicle 20, as will be explained more fully below. The cleaning vehicle 20 may also be provided with a remote control panel 45 which may be adapted to be strapped on the operator and which is connected to the control panel 41 by means of a suitable cable 46. By use of the remote control panel 45, the operator can move about the deck 12 to obtain a better vantage point for viewing the operation.of the cleaning vehicle 20 as it is being controlled. Also mounted on the frame 21.is a trolley, generally designated by the numeral 50, which includes an upper frame 51 provided with wheels 52 and a lower frame 53 provided with wheels 54, the wheels 52 and 54 being respectively disposed for rolling engagement with upper and lower flanges of the beams 22 and 24 for movement longitudinally therealong. The trolley 50 is driven by means of a double acting hydraulic drive cylinder 55 mounted on the beam 22 and provided with piston rods 56 at the opposite ends thereof, respectively fixedly secured to pulley blocks 57. Cables 58 are respectively fed through the blocks 57 and associated sheaves 59, each cable 58 having one end thereof anchored to the beam 22 and the other end thereof anchored to the trolley 50.Thus, it will be appreciated that as the piston rods 56 are moved in opposite directions, the trolley 50 will be pulled in opposite directions along the beams 22 and 24. Mounted on the trolley 50 and extending vertically therethrough for vertical reciprocating movement with respect thereto is an elongated support column 60, which is preferably of hollow construction rectangular in transverse cross section.The support column 60 is fixedly secured at its lower end to a circular pedestal 61 having pulleys 62 mounted thereon. A cable 63 has one end thereof fixedly secured to the trolley 50 and extends downwardly around the pulleys 62 in the pedestal 61 and then back up to a winch 64 mounted on the trolley 50. The winch 54 is driven by a hydraulic winch motor 65 also mounted on the trolley 50 for raising and lowering the support column 60. Sheaths 66 are provided for guiding cable and hydraulic line bundles along the frame 21 and upwardly to the.top of the support column 60, certain of these bundles then traveling down through the hollow support column 60. Coupled to the pedestal 61 and extending downwardly therefrom is an articulated support arm, generally designated by the numeral 70, including a main upper section 71 pivotally coupled to the pedestal 61 as at 72 and pivotally movable with respect thereto by means of a pair of drive cylinders 73 one shown . More particularly, each of the drive cylinders 73 has one end thereof pivotally coupled to the pedestal 61 and has its piston rod connected to the main section 71 of the arm 70 intermediate the ends thereof. The arm 70 also includes an end section 74 pivotally connected to the distal end of the main section 71 as at 75 and pivotally moved with respect thereto by means of a hydraulic drive cylinder 76.More particularly, one end of the drive cylinder 76 is pivotally connected to the main section 71 and the piston rod of the drive cylinder 76 is pivotally connected to the end section 74. The hose 35 extends downwardly along the articulated arm 70,. being secured thereto by suitable hose clamps 77. The hose 70 is coupled at its lower end to a suction intake nozzle 78 which is disposed adjacent to the end section 74 of the arm 70. Rotatably mounted on the end section 74 of the arm 70 is a cylindrical brush 80 which may be electrically or hydraulically driven by a suitable drive motor not shown . In operation, the hatch cover is removed from the cargo hold 15 and the cleaning vehicle 20 is moved along the rails 32 into position over the cargo hold 15. It will be appreciated that, for movement along the rails 32, the cleaning vehicle 20 will have the support column 60 completely raised so that the pedestal 61 is immediately beneath The trolley 50, and the articulated arm 70 will be raised to a substantially horizontal position iirmediately beneath the beams 22 and 24 so that it clears the flanges 18 and 19 at the tops of the cargo holds 15.When the cleaning vehicle 20 has been positioned over the cargo hold 15 to be cleaned, the trolley 50 is moved to the desired location, the articulated arm 70 is lowered and the support column 60 is lowered by means of the cable 63. The operator then moves the various parts of the cleaning vehicle 20, including the end section 74 of the articulated arm 70, until the brush 80 is brought into scouring engagement with the portion of the walls of the cargo hold 15 to be cleaned. It will be noted that the suction intake nozzle 78 is disposed beneath the brush 80 so that as material is loosened from the walls 13, 14, 16 and 17 of the cargo hold 15, it may be sucked up into the nozzle 78 and then via the hose 35 and the suction pump 33 to the hopper 34, where it is collected for later disposal. It is a significant feature of the present invention that, because of the various ranges of movement of the cleaning vehicle 20, the rotating brush 80 and the nozzle 78 may be moved to all parts of the cargo hold 15 for cleaning all of the wall surfaces thereof. Furthermore, the vacuum system of the present invention permits ready disposal of the cleaned residue from the hold 15 as it is removed from the walls thereof. The hose 35 is wound on and unwound from the reel 36 as the cleaning vehicle 20 and the parts thereof are moved so as to take up any slack in the hose 35. When the cargo hold 15 has been cleaned, the support column 60 and the articulated arm 70 are retracted and the cleaning vehicle 20 is moved to the next cargo hold 15. In this manner all the cargo holds of the vessel 10 can be readily cleaned by a single operator. Referring now to FIGS. 5 through 7 of the drawings, there is illustrated an alternative embodiment, generally designated by the numeral 120, of the cleaning vehicle of the present invention.The cleaning vehicle 120 is substantially identical to the cleaning vehicle 20, with the exception that the vacuum pump and collection hopper are not mounted thereon, but are rather mounted elsewhere on the vessel 10. Accordingly, the outlet end of the hose 35 is connected through a coupling 121 to an auxiliary hose section 122, the other end of which is adapted to be coupled to any of a number of quick disconnect couplings 123 disposed at spaced apart points along a fixed vacuum manifold 124 extending longitudinally along the deck 12 of the vessel 10. The vacuum manifold 124 is in turn coupled to the associated vacuum pump and collection hopper not shown which are located elsewhere on the vessel 10. Preferably, one of the quick disconnect couplings 123 is disposed adjacent to each of the cargo holds 15, so that as the cleaning vehicle 120 is moved from hold to hold, the auxiliary hose section 122 is always within reach of a coupling 123. While in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2 the hydraulic system was powered by an electric motor 42, it will be appreciated that the hydraulic system could also be driven by other motive means such as a diesel engine or the like, which could be mounted in place of the motor 42 on the carriage 30. In this event, the cable reel 39 would be obviated, such an arrangement being illustrated in FIGS. 5 through 7. While the present invention is disclosed as utilizing a rotating brush 80 at the end of the articulated arm 70, it will be appreciated that other types of cleaning devices could be utilized in place of the brush 80, such as scraping blades or the like. From the foregoing, it can be seen that there has been provided an improved apparatus for cleaning the cargo holds of ships, which apparatus is of simple and economical construction and is characterized by ease of operation by a single operator, providing effective cleaning of all portions of any type of hold and simultaneous removal of the cleaned residue material from the hold.
