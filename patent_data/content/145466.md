# PROCESS FOR CATALYTIC CRACKING OF METAL CONTAMINATED HYDROCARBONS IN WHICH THE CRACKING CATALYST IS PASSIVATED

## Abstract
A process is described for passivating metal contami nants present in hydrocarbon feedstock 16 which contami nants are deposited on cracking catalyst. The process involves contacting the regenerated catalyst from the regeneration zone 30 with H₂ containing gas 70, 74, 76, 76, 80, 96 in the transfer zone 42, 44 communicating with the regeneration zone and the reaction zone 12 . The H₂ containing gas may be added at a plurality of spaced apart locations to the transfer zone and preferably passes through a control means 72 which is regulated by a sensor means 82 analyzing a cracked product and or by a sensor means 64 monitoring the catalyst circulation rate.
