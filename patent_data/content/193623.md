# Bench sugar dosimeter.

## Abstract
It foresses a dosimeter conveyer 10 which is fitted with four orthogonal seat 11 , is integral with its shaft 12 and a spring device which allows its stop in station with an automatic release. For levelling on the border of the turning chamber, the dose is separated in the seat coming from the upper loading position from the remaining product gravitationally insisting in the container hopper. While the above dose reaches the intermediate station, the subsequent seat is charged. From this condition, the erogations will occur by means of each displacement of the handwheel by 90 required for bringing the doses from the intercluded intermediate position into the lower delivery one where it is discharged through a small beak 21 .

## Claims
Claims. 1 Bench sugar dosimeter, characterized by the fact that employs as kine mastic motion an inner rotating part which carries out loading and delivery in a gravitational way through correspondence of positions. This allows a compactedness of the whole which excludes fragile components of diffegently strained ones. The device according to the invention is controlled by means of a wheel consisting of a discoidal body fitted with a system of radially fitted pivots. The fingers casually introduced in the above pivots can control the delivery of one or more doses by tuning the wheel with hand traction according to one or more 900 excursions The excursions are regulated in automatic release by a spring mechanism acting by means of position retaining. The device employs an upper container with a hopper which gravitationally ensures the product presence until it is exhausted in the loading station, where four dosing seats successively arrive that are fitted on orthogonal axles on the cylindrical small of a dosing conveyor consisting of only one part and fitted according to a shape in the rotation chamber and supported centrally integral with the control wheel shaft. For levelling on the border of The rotation chamber, the dosing allowed quantity is separated from the rem ining pro duct in the loading station while this one reaches the intermediate station when the 900 excursion has been completed, where the space is inter cepted by the chamber wall, the preceding seat is supplied with product in loading station. From this position, the deliveries will be allowed until the product is exhausted by means of single 900 displacements of tile wheel to bring the doses in succession from the intermediate intercept cd station to the delivery one. In the delivery station fitted below in counterposition to the loading one, the discarge takes place. 2 Bench sugar dosimeter, as described in claim 1, characterized by the fact that it employs a glass container 1 with an above circular opening 2 for the product input which, on the bottom is laid on the dosing conveyer passing through a mouth 4 and a hopper 5 , above groove of metal piece 6 of the device.

The small beak 21 is then screwed on 7 Bench sugar dosimeter, as described in claim 1, characterized by the act that the tank 1 can be precluded by means of a cover 27 which inside holds integral a rod 28 .

## Description
Bench sugar dosimeter . Tne invention refers to a delivering device of sugar doses to be employed on ar benches to enable the customers to sweaten the drinks. The device is fitt Cd either on a fixed support or on a sliding line which thus enables to suit the position.Some types of sugar deliverers are already known one of them foresees a dos ing device to be acted by means of cams and with lever control. The device turns out to be easily deranged and is liable to being blocked owing to incrustations. In addition, the lever action which is liable to an initial catch condition by pressure is scarcely compatible with the natural requirements such a device and, through the beating actions differently impressed by the clients, may lead to unhinging of the device. Another type can be controlled by means of a crank gear of the throttle type for cocks.This system does not r llow the difficulties and defects of the lever devices, but it presupposes a condition of manual catch by pressure that requires a certain concentration mci effort. The invention device foresees a control by means of only the fingers casually introduced and, therefore, with mnemonic checking between the pins fitted ra dally on a control wheel. This allows a ready employ with an utmost low ef fort and without the neCessiMZYtof concentration on rhe device. The system essentially employs as kinematic motion an inner rotating part which carries out loading and delivery in a gravitational way through corresponden ce of positions This allows a compactedness of the whole which excludes fragile components or differently strained ones.The device according to Sle invention is controlled by means of a wheel cosisting of a discoidal body fitted with a system of radially fitted pivots. The fingers casually introduced in the above pivots can control the delivery of one or more doses by turning the wheel with hand traction according to one or more 900 cursions. The excursions are regulated in automatic release by a spring Schanism acting by means of position retaining.The device employs an up nezw container with a hopper which gravitationally ensures the product presence until it is exhausted in the loading station, where four dosing seats successively arrive that are fitted on orthogonal axles on the cylin trical wall of a dosing conveyor consisting of only one part and fitted according to a shape in the rotation chamber and supported centrally integral with the control wheel shaft. For levelling on the border of the rotation chamber, the dosing allowed quantity is separated from the re meLilLng product in the loading station while this one reaches the inter nediate station when the 900 excursion has been completed, where the space is intercepted by the chamber wall, the preceding seat is supplied with product in loading station.From this position, the deliveries will be allowed until the product is exhausted by means of single 900 displacements of the wheel to bring the doses in succession from the intermediate intercepted station to the delivery one. In the delivey sta tion fitted below in counterposition to the loading one, the discarge takes place with opening correspondence through a delivery small beak.A form of execution is illustrated in a merely indicative way and, as such, without limitation of the proceeding, on the drawings of TablesI and 2, where Fig. 1 is the longitudinal section of the device. Fig.2 is the longitudinal section of the same device displaced by 90 in the respect to it and without the container Fig 3 is the view of the device regulating the automatic release for maintaining the position of the dosing and conveying device.The version employs the glass container 1 with above circular opening 2 for the product input 3 which, on the bottom is laid on the dosing conveyer passing through mouth 4 and hopper 5, above groove of metal piece 6 of the device. The steady support of the container is allowed on the circular crown 7 of cylindrical layer 8 and by screw 9 fixing.For actioning, the dosing conveyor 10 with four seats II in the chamber of to dy 6 is moved on shaft 12 by means of wheel 13 to be shifted by traction of the fingers introduced into its pivots 14 in radial arrangement, by performing two 900 shittings successively . these ones allows the first dose to pass from the loading station to the precluded one and then to the delivery one, while the preceding seat is already supplied again with product and in the intermediate station, whereas the one which in its turn preceds it is in loading station.The dosing and carrying device turns in cavity 15 in counter shape and is kept in position corresponding to the four stations with hortogonal scheme by a pair of flat springs 16 fitted in part 17 of fixed support on body 6 by means of two screws 18 and acts on small block 19 integral with the dosing carrier 10 and wheel 13. For delivering the product, the wheel is rotated by 900 bringing the seat containing the product from the intermediate position on the delivery duct 20 fitted with small beak 21 below it and delivery mouth 22. For mounting the device, collar 25 of part 6 is inserted into hole 23 of the supporting bracket 24 which can be fitted on the bench in different way, and the whole is blocked by means of ring 26. The small beak 21 is then screwed on. Tank can be precluded by means of cover 27 which inside holds integral rod 28. The last one can be used to stir the product in the case it tends to heap in the loading duct.
