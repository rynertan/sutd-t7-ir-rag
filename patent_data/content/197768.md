# Digital control systems for electronic apparatus.

## Abstract
A digital control system for electronic apparatus 1 such as a television receiver, employs an internal bus 8 and includes at least one master controller 6 and a plurality of operation circuits 2 to 5 connected via control bus lines 9, 10 so that, during normal operation of the electronic apparatus 1 , the master controller 6 can carry out predetermined control operations relative to the respective circuit blocks 2 to 5 . During testing and or adjustment, an auxiliary master controller 12 is connected to the control bus lines 9, 10 in order to control the operational circuits 2 to 5 in place of the master controller 6 , while holding the master controller 6 in the slave mode.
