An override valve 16 by passes the regulating valve and cuts off flow of lubricant to the sump while assuming control of lubricant flowing from the source to the gearbox when a detent valve 17 , operatively as sociated with the bellows 4 , detects that either the regulating valve 10 or the bellows 4 is inoperative and permits the override valve 16 to become operative.
