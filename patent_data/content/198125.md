# Two part drive shaft for thermal engine.

## Abstract
An improved construction for a thermal engine, par ticularly a Stirling engine, comprising a two part drive shaft. One part of the drive shaft 18 contains the swashplate mechanism 14 and is journaled on the engine housing 12 so that the component of force acting on the swashplate 16 which induces bending of the drive shaft 18 is reacted on the housing 12 by the journaling 52, 56 of the one part of the shaft 18 . The second shaft part 62 is separate from but operatively coupled with the first mentioned shaft part 18 and has its own journal mounting on the housing. The opera tive coupling in the disclosed embodiment is by means of a spline connection 60 between the two shaft parts 18, 62 which are in coaxial alignment. The second shaft part 62 is journaled on a housing part 42 which is separable from other parts 48, 54 of the housing on which the first shaft part 18 is journaled. A pressure seal 82 between the rotating drive shaft and the housing is provided between the second shaft 62 part and its housing part 42 and in this way the seal is substantially isolated from the effect of bending loads imparted to the drive shaft by the swashplate mechanism.
