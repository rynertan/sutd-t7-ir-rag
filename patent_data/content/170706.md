Guide rods 20 are connected at their outsides via a stopper 21 and fixed to a pusher guide 22 at their insides, which are provided at an upper side of a side wall of the separator 4. The pusher guide 22 is formed with guide holes for reciprocating the pusher 17 in the normal direction. Reference numeral 23 is a chute on which the work 7 pushed by the pusher 17 gets at its front end, and a positioning pin 24 goes in and out at the end point of the chute 23. The positioning pin 24 is tapered as seen in Fig. 2 and moved vertically by a cylinder 25 installed under the chute 23. Further the chute 23 is provided with a sensor 26 for detecting the work 7 moving, in front of the positioning pin 24. The chute 23 is formed with a cutout 23a.The cutout 23a is served in that a work loading means not shown comes under the cutout and inserts a catching pin in a hole opened in an edge of the work 7 for getting it out. A detector of double pieces of the work is installed in the frame separator 4. A structure of the frame separator 4 will be explained withFigs.2 to 6. In the separator 4, upper and lower chacks have pawls for delaminating the work 7, and they are regularly opened and closed by means of cam mechanism. Reference numeral 27 is a cam shaft to be rotated by a speed control motor 28, which is secured with upper chack cams 29, right lower chack cams 30, left lower chack cams 31, and an elevating cam 32. Those cams are balanced in that the elevating cam 32 is centrally disposed with the left lower chack cams 31 at the both sides, the right lower chack cams 30 at their outsides, and the upper chack cams 29 at their further outsides. Reference numeral 33 is upper chack holders having cam followers 33 for connecting the upper chack cams 29. The upper chack holders 33 are slidable along a slide guide 35 bridging between side plates 34 and 34.Springs 36 are mounted on the slide guide 35, pressing the upper chack holders 33 toward the cam shaft 27 and pressing the cam followers 33a to the upper chack cams 29. Elevating plates 37 are provided at the left and right of the separator 4 for sliding supports 38 between the top plate 4a and a bottom plate 4b. The elevating plate 37 is pushed upwardly by a spring 39. Between the elevating plates 37, slide guides 40, 40 are provided and slidable in right lower chack holder 41 which are installed with cam followers 41a to right lower chack cams 30. Left lower chacks 42 also slidably insert slide guides 40, and installed with cam followers 42a to left lower chack cams 31. The lower chack holders 41, 42 are normally pressed to the cam shaft 27. A connector 43 connects the elevating plates 37 at their lower parts and is provided with a cam follower 43a contacting an elevating cam 32 for elevating the plates 37. Lower pawl bases 44 are secured on the lower chack holders 41, 42 having lower pawls 45.A distance between the upper surface of the base 44 and the pointed end of the pawl 45 is equal to a thickness of a piece of the work 7 refer to Fig. 7 . Upper pawl bases 46 are secured on the upper chack holders 33 and have upper pawls 47. A detecting head 9 of the double pieces detector positions its head slightly under the work 7 on the lower pawl base 4, and fixes it to either of left or right lower chack holders. The detector detects double pieces of the workd by, for example, changingin capacity of static electricity.SERVICE OF THE INVENTION The present invention will be explained in reference to the embodiment shown in the drawings. The laminated work 8 is set in the work stocker 2 in that the pressure plate 14 is lifted along the guide posts 10 by mechanical or manual force, and the pressure plate 14 is pressed laterally. Then a couple of the arms 12 slide backward within the tubes 13 phantom line in Fig. 3 and the pressure plate 14 is got out from the work stocker 2, and the laminated work 8 is charged within the work stocker 2. The pressure plate 14 is pulled out and moved down on the laminated work 8. The stoppers 15 are positioned at the rear sides of the arms 12, so that the pressure plate 14 may be pulled out till the normal position. Thereafter, the pressure plate 14 continuously presses the work 8 by it own weight. A next reference will be made to separation of the laminated work piece by piece. The lower chack holders 41, 42 are mounted on the slide guides 40, 40 between the elevating plates 37, and they are moved vertically in accordance with actuation of the elevating plates 37. That is, when the elevating cam 32 does not act on the cam follower 43a, the plate 37 is pushed upward by the spring 39, and the lower chack holders 41, 42 are lifted up. Then due to the relation between the lower chack cams 30, 31 and the cam followers 41a, 42a, the lower chack holders 41, 42 are pushed outside against the pushing force of the spring 40a, and open Fig. 7 b . On the other hand, since the upper chack holders 33 33 are not influenced with action of the upper chack cams 29, 29 to the cam followers 33a, they are pushed inward by the prings 36 and shut Fig. 7 b .Subsequently, if the upper chack cams 29 progress in rotation in accompany with rotation of the cam shaft 27, the upper chack holders 33, 33 are opened outward via the cam followers 33a. Then the laminated work 8 on the upper pawls 47 moves on the lower pawl bases 44 Fig. 7 c . The lower pawl bases 44 are opened, since the left and right lower chack cams 30, 31 act on the cam followers 41a, 42a, but when this action is released, the lower chack holder 41, 42 are pushed inward by the springs 40a, and come nearly. As a result, since the space between the lower pawl base 44 and the lower pawl 45 is equal to the thickness of one piece of the work, the lower pawl 45 enters between the lowest work and the work on it, and separates the lowest work Fig. 7 d .Thereby the separated work 7 stays on the lower pawl base 44 under the chacked condition, and the other laminated frames 8 exist on the lower pawl 45. When the action of the upper chack cam 29 to the cam follower 33a is finished under such a condition, the upper chack holders 33, 33 are pushed inward by the springs 36 and closed, and the upper pawl 47 at the same level as the lower pawl 45 enters under the laminated work 8 and receives it Fig. 7 e . When the elevating cam 32 acts on the cam follower 43a, the lower chack holders 41, 42 are moved down via the connector 43, the guide plate 37 and the slide guides 40 Fig. 7 f . At the same time, the lower chack cams 30, 31 act on the cam followers 41a, 42a to open the lower chack holders 41, 42. Then, the separated work 7 is made free on the lower pawl base 44 Fig 7 g .The cylinder 16 is worked to advance the pusher 17 within the work stocker 2 and to push the work 7 on the lower pawl base 44 outside of the work stocker 2 Fig. 7 h and a . The pushing amount is adjusted by an adjuster 18. On retreat of the pusher 17, the cylinder 25 is worked to lift the positioning pin 24.Since the positioning pin is tapered the tapered part of which the work 7 contacts on during lifting of the pin 24, the work 7 goes backward until the pin 24 stops lifting, and it is set at a determined position. If two pieces of the work are separated by error, the detector finds it out and stops the operation of the cylinder 16. The work delaminated properly is got out by a work loading means not shown , and when its rear end passes on the sensor 26, the initial operation is begun in response to a signal from the sensor 26. The above mentioned continous operation is made per one rotation of the cam shaft 27, and every time the cam shaft 27 is rotated, the delaminated work 7 is pushed out. The same operation as mentioned above is repeated. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION The invention is as mentioned above, and the closely laminated work is exactly separated automatically piece by piece. If any separation is made by error, it is detected automatically, so that the operation is smooth and effcient, and this is easily incorporated into the automatic line.
