# Apparatus for reproducing video and audio signals.

## Abstract
Drop outs are detected and compensated for in an apparatus for reproducing video and audio signals that have been recorded as first and second mixed signals in adjacent first and second parallel tracks, respectively, on a magnetic record medium such as a tape and in which each of the mixed signals comprises a video signal mixed with at least one frequency modulated audio signal, in the case of monaural, having a respective carrier frequency. The re corded mixed signals are reproduced by two magnetic heads 43A, 43B that scan the adjacent first and second tracks to reproduce alternately the mixed signals recorded thereon, and drop outs are detected in the reproduced signals. The audio signals are separated 51 to 54 from the reproduced mixed signals, frequency demodulated 59 to 62 and combined 67L, 67R to form a substantially continuous or reconstituted demodulated audio signal. A compensator 70L, 70R is provided in the demodulated audio signal path and is responsive to the detection of drop outs by a detector 76 therefor to produce a substantially continuous demod ulated audio signal, in which drop outs are compensated. A second drop out compensator 90 is provided for compen sating the video signal for drop outs.
