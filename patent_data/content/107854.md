# Heat shrinkable composite laminate film and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a heat shrinkable composite lamin ate film comprising an intermediate layer of a copolymer of vinylidene chloride, an outer layer of a polyamide, another outer layer of an olefin resin and two adhesive layers disposed between the intermediate layer and each of the two outer layers, the adhesive layers being at least one resin selected from the group consisting of a modified copolymer of ethylene and a vinyl carboxylate or an acrylic ester by an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or an acid anhyd ride thereof and a polymeric material obtained by further modifying the above mentioned modified copolymer with a metal compound, and a process for preparing the same.
