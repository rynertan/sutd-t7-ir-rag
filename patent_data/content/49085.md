# Hydraulic wheel cylinder assemblies and drum brakes incorporating same.

## Abstract
A hydraulic wheel cylinder assembly is particularly for use in a drum brake of the kind in which the wheel cylinder assem bly 34 is interposed between one pair or adjacent ends of a pair of brake shoes 12, 13 and a mechanical expander and fixed abutment means is interposed between the other pair of adjacent ends of the shoes. The wheel cylinder assembly incorporates a pair of piston assemblies 37, 38 each including an adjustable variable length tappet assembly comprising rotatable and unrotatable screw threaded compo nents 48, 49 . The rotatable screw threaded component 48 can move axially relative to the driven member 46 of a one way drive mechanism by compression of a spring 53 when a flange 55 on the driven member strikes the wheel cy linder body 35 . This provides a self centering force which prevents drag when the brake is installed with the shoes one above the other.
