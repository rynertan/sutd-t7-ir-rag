# PRESSURIZED DISPENSING POUCH

## Abstract
A product dispensing means is disclosed comprised of a gas generating piston action pouch 25 , formed in one embodiment from an elongated flexible plastic tubular member having one end portion 28 folded inwardly on the other portion 26 to integrally form an inner tube within an outer tube and outwardly slidable relative thereto. Both ends of the tubular member are sealed thus providing a sealed interstitial cavity 35, 36 , between the two portions and a product receptacle within the folded portion. Succes sive gas generating means 37, 38 39, 40 are located in said cavity and operatively connected between said portions 26, 28 to generate successive additional quantities of gas as said inner tube 28 moves outwardly from said outer tube 26 to dispense product from said receptacle under rela tively constant pressure or any variation or increase or de crease of pressure if shelf life performance dictates specific pressure variances. The pouch 25 itself can be a self contained product dispenser or can be utilized as an insert component in an other container.
