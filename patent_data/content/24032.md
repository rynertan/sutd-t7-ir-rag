# Phosphate glass compositions, and glass ceramic materials, and methods of making the same.

## Abstract
Phosphate glass compositions are described comprising from 8 to 35 wt P₂O from 8 to 48 wt SiO₂ and GeO₂, provided that the GeO content is not more than 6 wt , from 3 to 18 wt B₂O₃, from 16 to 28 wt Aℓ₂O₃, and from 8 to 33 wt CaO, MgO, SrO, and BaO, provided that the sum of the MgO, SrO, and BaO contents is not more than 15 wt , and wherein the sum of the above described oxides comprises at least 88 wt of the total composition and the ratio of the sum of the CaO, MgO, SrO and BaO contents to the P₂O content ranges from 0.6 1 to 1.4 1 certain of said compositions can be converted to a glass ceramic material by a thermal treatment for crystallization which includes the steps, in sequence, of 1 melting a glass composition, 2 molding the melted glass composition, 3 cooling the resulting molded composition to its transformation temperature or less, and 4 allowing phosphate crystal to separate out as a main crystal phase by a re heating treatment under conditions such that the molded shape is retained.
