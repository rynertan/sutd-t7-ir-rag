# Preparation of hop extracts rich in particular constituents.

## Abstract
Hop extract containing a high proportion of a desired constituent, hop oil, α acids or β acids, is formed by extracting hops with pressurized fluid carbon dioxide, collecting separate fractions of the extract obtained at different times, and selecting the fraction having a high proportion of the desired constituent. Fractions containing a at least 70 of the available hop oil at at least 10 concentration, and b at least 25 of the available α acids at at least 55 concentration, may be obtained in a single process by extracting initially at a lower temperature in the range 0 C to 57 C and subsequently at a higher temperature in the range 5 C to 31 C.
