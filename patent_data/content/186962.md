## Description
This invention relates to certain porphyrins and their use in cancer treatment. Haematoporphyrin derivatives of uncertain specific composition HpD have been used in cancer treatment, having been found to locate in tumours and other tissues after injection into the bloodstream and to sensitise cells to light irradiation transport in the blood is believed to be largely in association with the serum albumin . Irradiation, with a laser or other source, may be direct or indirect, for example using fibre optics. Irradiated cells unless deeply pigmented are rapidly killed to a depth depending on the light penetration. The mechanism of cell killing in phototherapy is believed to be largely by production of singlet oxygen. This is produced by transfer of energy from the light excited porphyrin molecule to an oxygen molecule. Singlet oxygen is highly reactive. It is believed to oxidise cell membranes so that they are damaged and become incapable of exerting their function of controlling the cell s internal environment. This rapidly leads to cell death. In addition to the use of HpD there is prior art in the literature of tumour locating tetraphenyl porphyrins in Chemical Abstracts We have sought to improve on the prior art, and in particular to improve on HpD by finding well characterised and thus more exactly controllable compounds. Other aims have been finding compounds activated by light at wavelengths longer than those used to activate HpD so as to exploit deeper penetration of longer wavelength radiation, and to increase effectiveness generally, as in many anatomical sites, such as the brain, HpD has been found to sensitise normal cells unduly as well as cancerous cells. The wavelength at which a photosensitising compound is activated is one factor in its Selectivity of damage for various tissues, including tumours, is governed by a variety of factors, including selective uptake, selective vulnerability and selective ability to repair damage cf. Albert A.A. The invention provides a method of making a medicament for therapy of tumours susceptible to necrosis when an appropriate compound is administered to locate in the tumour followed by illumination of the tumour with light of a wavelength absorbed by the compound, said method making use of It is preferred that one or more of the substituents R should be of a kind and in a form able to ionise at physiological pH, to increase the absorption in the red part of the spectrum, that is in the portion that most effectively penetrates tissue. Compounds not very soluble in themselves may be solubilised by the presence of suitable groups such as sulphonate groups. The invention further extends to the compounds per se when novel and to the method of therapy itself. Methods of preparation of porphyrin compounds are known in the art and may be used for example to make a preferred compound, itself known, namely 5,10,15,20 tetra 4 hydroxyphenyl porphyrin HK7 . Similar methods may be applied to make the other compounds and examples are given below. The ethanol tetra solvate of HK7, a new compound, may be made as follows 5,10,15,20 tetra 4 acetoxyphenyl porphyrin 0.5g is refluxed for five and a half hours in methylated spirits 250ml containing potassium hydroxide 0.36g .

The solid is washed with cold water to remove sodium acetate, and the residue is recrystallised from tetrahydrofuran chloroform to give purple crystals 0.47g of HK7.

The thio sulphydryl and methylthio analogues of ortho HK7 and para HK7 are made analogously to the ortho methoxyphenyl and hydroxyphenyl compounds above, using methylthio ethers of benzaldehyde as starting materials and cleaving off the methyl groups as required. The thioethers are prepared according to R.C. Crawford and C. Woo, Can. J. Chem. 1965, Vol. 43, p3178 for the ortho compound and W.P. Buu Hoi, N.D. Xuong, N.B. Tien, Michel Sy and Guy Lejeune, Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 1955, p1594 for the para compound. In human therapy HpD has been used to treat some 2 3000 patients world wide. Some recent results are given in Doiron D.R. and Gomer C.J. eds The evidence is i that HK7 is a more effective photo sensitiser for tumour tissue in animal assay than is HpD ii that unlike HpD, HK7 does not cause detectable cerebral photo sensitivity in animals in dose regimes that effectively sensitise tumours and that it therefore has promise in the treatment of brain tumours and iii that the skin photosensitisation produced by HK7 is less persistant than that caused by HpD. However, HK7 is relatively insoluble in neutral aqueous media and, in the present experiments, it was given either in 0.0125 0.05 M.NaOH or in physiological saline intravenously, or in DMSO intraperitoneally. The method was as described in Berenbaum, Bonnett and Scourides Br. J. Cancer, 1982, As shown by van Gemert, Berenbaum Gijsbers Br.J. Cancer 1985, i Mice were given 0.033µM kg i.v. of HpD or HK7 and 24 hours later the cranium exposed to 20J cm² of white light. Deaths within 48 hours due to acute cerebral oedema were ii Mice treated with HK7 or HpD as above or with saline i.v. were given Evans blue complexed to bovine serum albumin i.v. 4 hours after exposure of the cranium to 20J cm² white light, and the amount of Evans blue in the brain measured 1 hour later. Normally, very little is found, and this is largely dye still circulating in the blood 1 hour after injection, and not in the brain substance itself. An increase is produced by agents that damage the brain vascular lining, allowing dye to enter the brain substance. Results µg dye brain in groups of 5 mice were Thus, 24 hours after a dose of HpD that normally produces relatively little tumour sensitisation see graph , there is a lethal cerebral photosensitivity and damage to brain blood vessels. In contrast, 24 hours after a dose of HK7 that produces substantial tumour sensitisation, there is no cerebral photo sensitivity detectable by these methods. An unexpected benefit over HpD has been found from the results of a comparison of skin photosensitisation induced by HpD and HK7 in equimolar doses. Mice were given doses of porphyrin and depilated skin exposed to 10J cm² of light at the appropriate wavelength 625nm for HpD, 656nm for HK7 at various times after the injection. The increase in skin thickness was measured 4 hours after illumination. It was shown that, 1 day after porphyrin injection, HK7 is a more potent skin sensitiser than HpD. By 1 week, there is little difference. By 2 weeks, the maximum dose of HK7 no longer sensitises to this dose of light. However, HpD still produces significant sensitisation at 2 and 3 weeks. The conclusion is that HK7 is a more potent skin photo sensitiser than HpD, but that the effect is more transient, a desirable feature. A preliminary comparison was made. Both materials dissolved easily in DMSO, and dilution in 0.05M.Na0H gave dark green solutions. The light dose was 10J cm² at 660nm. Depths of tumour necrosis in mm were Thus, no significant difference was found between the two substances in this system. The compounds prepared above have been tested in a fuller series of trials as follows It should be noted that the experimental tumours averaged 5mm in depth and, in the higher dose ranges, many showed full depth necrosis. Therefore, in these dose ranges, the values for depth of tumour necrosis given in the table are probably underestimates. It may be seen that HK7 is rather more effective administered in DMSO than in alkali but that m HK7 is equally effective in both. The depth of necrosis is dose related, and in general a balance must be struck between doses being high enough to show useful necrosis and not so high as to be prohibitively toxic. For example, the lithium, sodium and zinc salts of HK7 show necrosis depth below 1.0 mm at 12.5 µm kg while HK7 itself is reasonably effective at 6.25 µm kg and meta HK7 is effective at 3.12 µm kg and with some effect even at 1.56 µm kg. It is the most active compound found. Assuming that the potency ratios between these compounds and HpD found in mice hold approximately for man also, we would expect the most effective doses in man to lie in the range 0.25 1.0mg kg, subject to the fact that the safe and effective range for a given compound must be found by trial. At its widest, subject always to that proviso, the range will not be outside 0.01 to 10.0 or possibly up to 100 mg kg. Ranges for the dose of illumination are, for example, 2.5 to 500 J cm² conveniently 5 to 250 J cm² depending primarily on tumour thickness. In some instances more than one such dose of light may be desirable following a single, or possibly, more than one such administration of the porphyrin. For comparison HpD given in 0.5 NaHC0₃ at 67 µm kg and illuminated at 630 nm gave a tumour necrosis depth of 2.79 1.36 mm 7 molecular weight of HpD assumed 600 , while the sodium salt of tetra
