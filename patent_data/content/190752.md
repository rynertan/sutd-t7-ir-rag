# Yaw damper for swivelable railcar trucks.

## Abstract
The damper includes an elongated member that is movable conjointly with a swivelable railcar truck, and a yaw control assembly mountable by an overhead carbody. This assembly grips the elongated member so that a frictional damping force is applied to it when the truck negotiates curved track. In one embodiment, the damping force obtained remains substantially constant and, in another embodiment, it is proportional to load.
