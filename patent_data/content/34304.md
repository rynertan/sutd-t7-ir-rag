# Method of immobilizing an enzyme in a bundle of cellulosic fibres for a fibre bundle dialyzer for purifying blood.

## Abstract
The object of the method is to immobilize a desired enzyme on the lumen surfaces of the dialyzer fibres typically having an inner diameter of 200 300 microns and wall thick ness of 10 20 microns, without prejudice to the chemico physical, dialyzing and bio compatibility properties of the fibres. The enzyme is anchored directly or indirectly through covalent bonds upon activation of the lumen surfaces by circulation through the lumens of an aqueous solution of sodium periodate at a concentration of 0.7 21 mg ml, at a circulation rate of 300 500 mm³ minute referred to 1 mm² of cross sectional area of the lumen, at 15 30 C for a time not exceeding 70 minutes.
