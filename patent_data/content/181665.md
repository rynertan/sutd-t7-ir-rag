# Method of transmitting information in a digital transmission system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and a transmitter arrangement 2, 2 1 shown in Figure 1 for transmitting information in a digital transmission system 1 in time division multiplex with a given repetition rate. So as to prevent to the greatest possible extent overlap of the information transmitted by the different transmitter arrange ments, the repetition rates for each transmission arrange ment are chosen to be different such that they depend on a unique identification number to be assigned to each trans mission arrangement. Consequently one transmission arrangement transmits more frequently than the other one. The invention has for its object to keep the number of times each transmitter arrangement transmits as equal as possible. According to the invention, the repetition rate is chosen in dependence on a unique identification number assigned to each transmitter arrangement, and an inhibit signal is generated for preventing the transmission and moreover, the inhibit signal is generated more frequently as the repetition rate becomes shorter. This solution has the advantage that it can be realized using only digital circuits which can be implemented in one IC.
