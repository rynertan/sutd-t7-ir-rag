# Apparatus for spreading fibres uniformly over a conveyor surface.

## Abstract
Apparatus for spreading fibres uniformly over a con veyor has separate fibre distributors 10, 12 which deposit dry fibres onto a conveyor belt 22 through foraminous discharge outlets 29 . Fibrous mat produced on the travelling conveyor belt 22 by discharge from a first distributor 10 tends to bunch or fluff up between this and the next distributor. To prevent this, the distributors 10, 12 have their outlets 29 open to a common, substantially sealed tunnel 26 through which the conveyor belt 22 travels. The tunnel top 46 between the distributors 10, 12 is perforated and its bottom is ex posed to a partial vacuum whereby a downward air flow is created between the distributors 10, 12 which holds the mat onto the belt 22 .
