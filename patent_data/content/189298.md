## Description
MOTOR CYCLE TYRESThis invention relates to motor cycle tyres and, in particular, to tyres for high performance and racing motor cycles.When considered in cross section, such tyres have sharply curved tread regions to allow for banking over of the motor cycle. The tread region is specially reinforced so that the necessary tread and carcass stability is provided for vehicle handling whilst being sufficiently flexible to provide sufficient localised tread flattening in the ground contact patch for road grip.Previous attempts to reduce heat generation have used low grip compounds or thinner tyre tread thicknesses, but these were not useful solutions in practice.It is an object of the present invention to reduce the heat generated in the tread compound in the ground contact patch itself without materially affecting the tread stiffness and grip so that vehicle handling may be maintained without loss of tyre road grip.According to the present invention, a tyre for a motor cycle comprises a carcass having a pair of spaced apart reinforced annular bead regions, a central tread supporting region, the tread supporting region being reinforced and shaped to provide a substantially curved cross section reinforced tread supporting region, and a tread region radially outwards of the tread support region and mounted thereon, wherein the tread region comprises a wear zone formed by a thickness of rubber tread compound containing no fabric reinforcement which wears during use of the tyre, a sub tread layer of rubber compound and between said wear zone and sub tread layer, an inter tread layer of highextensibility fabric reinforcement.The inter tread layer reinforcement preferably comprises cords of a highextensibility material, for example, polyamide having an extensibilityof 8 162. This extensibility of the fabric reinforcement is essential to avoid the inter tread reinforcement layer affecting the carcass stiffness and thus the vehicle handling properties.It should be noted that no inter tread reinforcement fabric must be positioned in the wear zone of the tyre tread so that the rubber compound, and tread pattern where used, is able to operate in the normal manner and thus provide good grip. This is particularly important for race tyre treads where sufficient tread heating is essential. When a tyre tread pattern is used providing a useful wear thickness the depth of the pattern, the inter tread fabric may be positioned at the base of the tread pattern.The inter tread reinforcement fabric may comprise cross woven fabric, but is preferably a single ply of substantially weftless tyre cord fabric. Preferably the cords of the tyre cord fabric are laid at an angle between Oo and 900 to the circumferential direction so that the effect is to reduce movement at the base of the wear region of the tread, due to entry and leaving the ground contact patch and resist heat generation without affecting carcass stiffness.More than one layer of ply of inter tread reinforcement fabric may be used and the cord angles may be the same in each ply or different.The tyre may be a crossply or radial ply tyre and in either case a tread reinforcement package or breaker may be used adjacent to the carcass reinforcement and spaced from the inter tread reinforce fabric by the sub tread layer.Further aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description, by way of example only, of two embodiments in conjunction with the attachedextensibilitydrawings in which Fig 1 is a construction of a 375 3700 18 inch motor cycle race tyre of the slick or patternless type.andFig 2 is a cross section of a 130 80 x 18 inch motor cycle road tyre.The tyre comprises a tread region 1 which has a convex ground engaging surface to allow for banking over of the machine and a toroidal carcass which together with the wheel rim not shown forms the air chamber for the tyre. The carcass comprises sidewalls 2 and bead regions 3 reinforced by bead reinforcement hoops 4 .A carcass reinforcement 5 of two plies of rayon tyre fabric extends around the tyre carcass and is anchored to each bead hoop 4 by being wrapped around it. The carcass reinforcements are both laid at 880 to the circumferential direction to provide a radial carcass.The tread region of the tyre is reinforced to give the required structural rigidity properties for the tyre by a pair of tyre fabric breaker plies 5 and 6 each of which comprises weftlessKevlar registered trade mark cord tyre fabric laid with the cords 0 at 25 to the circumferential direction with the cords of ply 6 crossing the cords of ply 5 . The construction so far is quite conventional and in a normal tyre a thick layer of tread rubber would now be placed over the breakers.The present construction, however, has a sub tread layer 7 of tread compound positioned over the breakers 5 and 6 . This layer is shown cross hatched for clarity. The sub tread layer 7 extends across the full width of the tread 1 to the tread shoulders 8 . An inter tread reinforcement ply 9 comprising a single ply of polyamide nylon fabric is positioned over the sub tread layer 7 and extends from one shoulder to the other.The fabric is a plane woven fabric of 100 cords per inch polyamide with cotton weft spaced at 10 mm. The polyamide cords are two filaments of 140 tex polyamide and the cord has an extensbility of 8.7 . The polyamide cords are laid at 450 to the circumferential direction.It should be noted that both the sub tread layer 7 and the tread wear zone 10 comprise tread compound and together they produce a 6 mm thick tread zone. The inter tread ply 9 is high extensibility material and this does not materially effect the tread stability when the tread region is considered as a whole which determines its resultant effect on the tyre properties which give the tyre its handling properties. Nevertheless, the inter tread ply 9 by its presence within the tread thickness has been found to substantially reduce heat generation throughout the total tread thickness of 6 mm without preventing surface tread heating which is essential to allow modern high grip tread compounds to reach their maximum grip. As shown in Fig 2, where the same reference numerals are used as with the first embodiment, this construction is also advantageous with a patterned tread and in that case the inter tread fabric layer 9 is best positioned at the base of the tread pattern so that its effect is maintained throughout the life of the tyre tread.Alternative inter tread layer constructions may be used including two or more layers of fabrics and non woven fabrics. Other materials may also be used as long as the resultant cords have an extensibility between 8 and 16 so that the inter tread fabric does not materially affect the overall tread properties.The tread construction with sub tread, inter layer and wear zone may also be used on tyres other than radial ply tyres, for example, crossply tyres as long as they are of the type described with a substantially covered tread supporting region.
