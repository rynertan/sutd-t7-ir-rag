## Description
DESCRIPTIONThe present invention refers to a system for the extraction of the coor dinates of a moving aircraft by means of a primary radar.It is known that todays density of air traffic requires the ability of the control system to reduce the separation between the aircraft. Such a reduction requires a high degree of assurance and precision in the extraction of the coordinates of the aircrafts.Today, good results are obtained utilizing highly specialized radar and with extraction systems integrated in the processing radar.This invention is a result of the need to better the precision and reso lution intrinsic in radar apparatus and connected to its significant para meters of antenna beam, pulse duration, data rate, prf and sampling rate.What is proposed operates on the data after radar elaboration on the basis of an analysis of the shape of the processed video signal.The proposed algorithm allows the retracing with optimum precision to the true position of the aircraft and to discriminate distinct echoes that present themselves at video level without a solution of continuity. This is obtained without worsening the performance of the radar in terms of sensibility matched filter and M T I capacity antenna with adequate beam width .Up to now, the extraction operation of the coordinates of an aircraft by means of a primary radar has been obtained by a device external to the radar that has the triple function of quantization azimuth integration and.target detection measurement of the target coordinatesThe quantization is necessary because old radars do not guarantee the normalization of all the types of interferences, therefore requiring a variable detection level in order to control the number of false echoes.The azimuth integration is required because these radars are not provided with azimuthcorrelation that improves the detection capability.The measurement of the coordinates of the echo assigns to each echo the corresponding values of distance and azimuth on the basis of elementary calculations.This external extractor, that has some validity when applied to older generation radars, suffers intrinsic limitations when connected to an adaptive radar.These limitations derive principally from the limited capacity of the quantizer to adapt itself to all the possible types of interferences, other limitations such as the mismatching of the quantization interval should also be taken into consideration.Present modern radar signal processors contain the quantization func tions and azimuth correlation with the following principal chara cteristics the integrated quantizer permits intervention in all the crucial points of the radar, inclusive of the RF and IF parts. the mismatching in terms of sampling and the use of special interfaces are completely eliminated.Therefore, considering valid the assumption that quantization and inte gration are integrated in the same radar processor, only the measure ment of coordinates and the discrimination between close targets has to be realized by means of an extractor.The algorithm to calculate the exact position of the target used in conventional targets is not adequate if the requirements of precision and resolution become very stringent, as is necessary in overcrowded air spaces.Conventional extractors are realized using real time processors whose elaboration capacity limit is the hardware complexity.This, together with the imperfect knowledge of the detection phenomena, has limited in the past the obtainment of optimum extraction charac teristics. The availability today of adaptive processing techniques, such as the realization of sophisticated algorithms by means of microprocessors, permits a new approach to the problem of radar data extraction.To extract supplementary information for the target coordinates the complete analysis of the echo is an element of the detection process that must be considered.The analysis of the target center is therefore shifted from the analysis of the first slash received to the analysis of the entire cluster of slashes see figure 1 for the definition .A noteworthy effort has been dedicated to the realization of the best al gorithm, that in the best manner possible approximates the true coordinates of the target. The optimum procedure is based on the preliminary examination of the cluster configuration followed by the synthesis of an algorithm capable of arriving at the double purpose of minimization of the estimated error with respect of the true position maximization of the resolution capacityThis algorithm takes into consideration all the radar parameters such as transmitted pulse lengthEMI4.1 width of the azimuth.beamEMI4.2 pulse duration bandwidth productEMI4.3 sampling periodEMI4.4 number of responses in the antenna beamEMI4.5 type of signal processing echo strength with the essential requirement of resolvi ng echoes that could appear superimposed.Taking into consideration the casual position of the received echo with respect to the established sampling time, the position of the first sample is affected by an error characterized by an average valued and by an rms value that are. a function of the sampling period and the signal noise relationship.It has been found that the complete cluster analysis permits the determination of the true position.Range accuracyThis algorithm is summarized in the following criteria.To each displayed cluster are assigned three parameters for each slash of the clusterEMI4.6 where i is the initial distance of the ith slash di is the initial azimuth of the ith slash li is the length in quantum of azimuth of the ith slashThe procedure for the estimation of the true distance R is EMI5.1 where 1 is the initial distance of the 1st slash d is a quantity that is a function of the numebr of slashes N , of the sampling interval tc and of the pulse shape .

Simple algorithms, that use the shape recognition technique, are used to divide in two parts a complex cluster representative of two very close targets. Moreover, special care has been taken to avoid information losses in the position calculation of the two targets after the separation. The basic algorithm for the separation is based on the presence of an, inflection point on the extension in azimuth of the adjoining slashes fig. 2 The inflection is accepted if its amplitude exceeds a pre established limit. If the result is not positive a separation is assigned even if the number of continuous slashes exceeds a pre established limit. This limit is determinated as a function of the maximum number of con tinuous slashes attributable to an isolated target. Once taken the decision to separate, two new clusters are generated. The operation is realized in such a manner that the compression error on the successive single target position evaluation is minimized.

As an example, for the typical values of PD 0.9 and PR 0.9 the new extractor resolves 63 more of the case than the conventional extractor. Azimuth ResolutionA similar approach has been used for the separation of two targets that are adjacent in azimuth.The example of figure 3 shows how the presence of an inflection point the range extension indicates a point of separation.In this case the extraction of the inflection point is also taken into con sideration.The results are summarized in table IV using the same philosophy as table II.I.

PR. Besides the algorithms already described that work in azimuth distance an additional calculation is performed on all the clusters that exceed a certain shape in order to decide if the best configuration which is adapted to the cluster corresponds to two targets separated in azimuth and distance.The invention is described by the figures, in which figure 1 illustrates an outline of the system simulation approach, figure 2 shows an example of analysis in range of the cluster shape, figure 3 an . example of analysis in azimuth of the cluster shape, and figure 4 shows a block diagram of the system..The unit receives the antenna data from the radar, the radar synchro rnzation signal tc 3, and the raw videoThe unit processes the raw video with the same radar tc and does not therefore present an alignment problem with the radar. Because ulterior filtering and integration operations are not necessary on the input video the unit directly performs the target coordinate cal culations. This calculation in the case of conventional extractors relys on the determination of the coordinates of the center of the first slash of the raw video.In the case of the invention in question the calculation is instead executed on the basis of a sophisticated analysis of the raw video shape.In this way are obtained 1 Greater precision in the determination of the true target position.2 Superior resolution power between adjacent targets in that it relys not totally and only on the separation of the corresponding radar echoes, but on the determination in the echo, of one or morei of the typical shapes of a target.3 Minor probability to separate in more targets the echo correspond ing to a single target, for the same reason as in point 2.The description of the shape of the raw video is obtained on the basis of two parameters the cluster the slashFor slash is meant to whole of the returns atthe same distance and correlated in azimuth.For clusters is meant the whole of the returns correlated in. azimuth and range. The cluster is univocally determined by the whole of the slashes constructed with the returns that make it up.The slash is univocally determined byb Distance common to the entire slash Azimuth of the center slash Extension of the slash in number of appearances Figure 4 describes the functions carried out by fundamental blocks of the unit according to the invention.Correlation of the successive video returns in real time. and description of the slash block 1 .Correlation of the slash in distance and azimuth in real time and description of the cluster block 2 .Real time transfer of the cluster to a support memory block 3 .The result of the process is then transferred to the processing block 4 made up of the microprocessor 6, of the memory 5 and of the interface with the direct access to the memory 7. This performs the function of implementing the extraction algorithm and in particular the cluster discrimination in one or more targets by means of an analysis of the shape, by evaluation of the center of the target so determined, by implementation. of the filtering algorithm on the basis of the quality of the signal, by formation of the output mes sages and the management of the input output channels. The invention has been described in one of its particular realized forms but it is evident that modificazions and corrections can be made, be it to the form of the basic algorithm as to the realization scheme of the same without, because of this, leaving the limits of protection of the present industrial patent right.
