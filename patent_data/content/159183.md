# Automatic sheet product line.

## Abstract
A product line is provided for forming a sheet product composed of products such as bacon slices resting on a pre cut thin substrate such as a sheet of paper. The substrate sheets are pre cut to a predetermined length, and a flow of individual products and a flow of pre cut sheets are coordin ated such that the products deposit onto the pre cut sheets in a predetermined pattern. The line may also include an assembly for reducing the flow rate of the thus formed sheet products, after which the reduced flow is conveyed to a stacking assembly for forming stacks of sheet products of a preselected size.
