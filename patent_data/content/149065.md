# A protection clamp circuit for use in a monolithic circuit which inhibits current transients.

## Abstract
First and second Schottky diodes are formed in a respective first and second isolated epitaxial epi regions of a monolithic integrated circuit to inhibit current spikes that may otherwise occur as the monolithic circuit is inserted or removed from a hot socket having both an input signal and an operating potential supplied thereto. The monolithic circuit includes a floating resistor formed in a first isolated epi region which is connected between the input of the monolithic circuit to which the input signal is supplied and the base of a transistor. The transistor is formed in a third epi region which is isolated from both the first and second epi regions. The second epi region, which may contain one or more circuit elements, is contacted to the operating potential. The Schottky diodes provide clamping across the base emitter junctions of two parasitic transistors which form a SCR that can be rendered conductive by the substrate not being grounded. The SCR is inhibited from being turned on by the two Schottky clamping diodes.

## Description
A PROTECTION CLAMP CIRCUIT FOR USE IN A MONOLITHIC CIRCUIT WHICH INHIBITS CURRENT TRANSIENTS Background of the Invention The present invention relates to protection circuits for use in monolithic integrated circuits. More particularly, the present invention relates to a protection circuit which inhibits turn on of a parasitic silicon controlled rectifier SCR which can be formed in the monolithic circuit containing diffused resistors within floating epitaxial tubs. There are integrated circuits IC s utilizing diffused resistors that are placed in isolated epitaxial regions, i.e., floating epitaxial tubs, For instance, one such IC is the MC1489 Line Receiver that is manufactured by Motorola, Inc. which is schematically illustrated in FIG. 1. The MC1489 comprises an input resistor which is coupled between an external pin of the IC to the base of an internal input transistor thereof. This resistor is diffused into a separate region of the epitaxial layer of the IC which is isolated from other epitaxial regions or tubs by use of diffusion islands as is well known thereby forming an epitaxial tub with no preohmic contact to the epitaxial tub hereafter referred to as a floating epi. island . Generally, the substrate of the IC is connected to an additional external pin through one of the isolation regions and is intended to be grounded during normal applications of the IC. Similarly, the operating potential for the IC is connected through an external pin to another one of the isolated epitaxial tubs of the IC. IC manufacturers usually evaluate their C s after final package assembly to ensure that the IC s meet electrical specifications. Such testing may include inserting and removing the IC from a hot socket which has a test input signal and power supply voltages continually supplied thereto. It has been found that if the substrate of the IC, as described above, is not grounded, as can happen while inserting or removing the IC from the hot socket, that a failure mode may occur which can damage or even destroy the IC. This failure mode results from a parasitic SCR that is associated with the floating epitaxial tub in which the resistor is formed. A large current spike, which has been observed, is generated by the parasitic SCR that actually destroys the IC by, among other things, causing evaporation of the metal connecting runs on the IC.Hence, there is a need for a protection circuit to inhibit or at least seve rely limit the above described current transients. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a Schottky diode protection circuit for use in monolithic circuits. Another object of the present invention is to provide a monolithic line receiver circuit having a Schottky diode protection circuit. Still another object of the present invention is to provide circuitry for inhibiting parasitic SCR turn on in a monolithic circuit. In accordance with the above and other objects there is provided a monolithic integrated circuit including a substrate and a plurality of isolated epitaxial tubs formed on the substrate, a resistor formed in one of the epitaxial tubs and connected between an input and a second epitaxial tub, and a third isolated epitaxial tub to which contact is made to a supplied operating potential, wherein the integrated circuit has a first Schottky diode formed in said first tub and a second Schottky diode formed in said second tub whereby a parasitic silicon controlled rectifier, otherwise formed between said first and second epitaxial tubs, is clamped to inhibit turn on of the same if the substrate is not grounded while the input signal and the operating potential are supplied to the monolithic integrated circuit. Brief Description of the Drawings FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a monolithic circuit illustrating a parasitic SCR circuit formed therein FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of a portion of the monolithic circuit of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of the monolithic circuit of FIG. 1 including the protection circuit of the present invention and FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of the protection circuit in combination with the parasitic SCR of the preferred embodiment. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a typical monolithic integrated circuit 10 which suffers by having a parasitic silicon controlled rectifier SCR structure 12 shown in dashed lines formed therein which under certain operating conditions can damage or even destroy the integrated circuit. For explanation purposes, circuit 10 may be exemplified by the Motorola, Inc. MC1489 Line Receiver.This Line Receiver is designed to interface data terminal equipment with data communications equipment in comformance with the specifications of EIA standard number RS 232C. In this application the Line Receiver detects an input voltage at external pin 14, the magnitude of which may be between plus and minus 25 volts. In normal application, the substrate of the IC is grounded through external pin 16, as understood, and the IC is supplied an operating potential VCC of typically 5 volts. Line Receiver 10 comprises three amplifier stages 18, 20, and 22 and has internal feedback from the second intermediate stage 20 to input stage 18 through resistor 24. The three amplifier stages include transistors 26, 28, 30 and resistors 32, 34, and 36 respectively.In response to an applied input voltage at terminal 14, a corresponding output signal is supplied at output terminal 38. Resistor 40 is coupled between input 14 and the base of transistor 26 and is located in a floating epi island in which the epi potential floats at most 1 below the most positive potential applied to the resistor where is a diode voltage drop. Resistor 42 and diode 44 provide biasing of transistor 26 and clamping functions respectively. As previously mentioned, a serious current transient problem may occur during testing of IC 10 when the substrate is not grounded. To understand the problem that arises a cross sectional view of IC 10 is illustrated inFIG. 2. As shown, IC 10 is comprised of a substrate 50 which is formed of a first or P type semiconductor material. An epitaxial or epi layer 52 is then formed onto substrate 50. The epi layer is of a second or N type semiconductor material. A dielectric layer 54 having selective openings formed therein is disposed onto the upper surface of epi layer 52. Also, during the fabrication process, buried layers 56 and 58 of N type semiconductor material may be formed between epi layer 52 and substrate 50. During fabrication P isolation regions are selectively formed through the epi layer to isolate different epi regions or tubs from each other as is known. For instance, isolation regions 60 and 62 provide an isolated epi tub 64 and an additional tub 66 within epi layer 52. Resistor 40 is then formed by a P type region 68 within isolated tub 64 and is disposed between P type regions 70 and 72. Conductive metal layers are selectively deposited onto dielectric layer 54 to form circuit connections as required. Input terminal 14 is thereby connected through a metal run which includes metal layer 74 connected to resistor 40 through P region 72. Similarly, the distal end of resistor 40 region 68 is coupled through P region 70 and metal layer 76 to the base of transistor 26 as indicated by terminal V1. It is to be understood that transistor 26, as well as transistors 28 and 30 are formed in epi layer 52 in a known and conventional manner.The external power supply voltage is applied through a metal run such as layer 78. Substrate 50 is coupled through appropriate metal runs to external pin 16 which in normal use is grounded. As indicated, P isolation region 62 may be contacted to pin 16 through metal layer 80 to connect substrate 50 thereto, or the substrate can be connected through any similar P isolation region to provide this connection. Besides being contacted to VCC through N contact 82, isolated epi tub 66 may include one or more circuit elements as understood. The manufacturing steps and process for fabricating IC 10 are conventional and are known to those skilled in the art. As can be seen in FIG. 2, a parasitic SCR 12 is formed by the diffusion layers including resistor 40 comprised ofP regions 68, 70, and 72 , N epi region 64, P substrate 50, and N epi region 66. f n normal circuit operation, substrate 50 being connected to ground, no mechanism is provided which can turn this parasitic SCR on. Thus, with substrate 50 grounded, parasitic transistor 46 FIG. 1 ofSCR 12 is maintained in an off state. Therefore, neither transistor 46 nor transistor 48 affects the circuit operation of IC 10. However, if substrate 50 is not grounded, as can happen while IC 10 is inserted or removed from a hot socket, i.e., a socket to which VCC and the input signal are supplied, transistor 46 is no longer guaranteed to be in an off state. If, for example, VIN applied to input 14 is greater than VCC, which can be the case, it is believed that a failure mode is created by transistor 26 or other signal path being rendered conductive to supply current into substrate 50. With the potential of substrate 50 floating, a current path is provided through the substrate to turn on transistor 46 of SCR 12 through P region 62 gate electrode G . This produces a regenerative action as transistor 48 is thereby rendered conductive. SCR 12 is quickly latched on to generate a large current spike which can destroy the IC. Turning to FIG. 3 there is shown IC 10 in crosssectional view illustrating the Schottky diode protection clamp circuit of the preferred embodiment which inhibitsSCR 12 from being rendered conductive as aforedescribed.It is to be understood that the same reference numerals used in FIG. 2 are utilized in FIG. 3 to identify corresponding elements. Additional P region 84 is formed in epitaxial region 64 to which metal deposition layer 74 is contacted. Similarly, additional P region 86 is formed in tub 66 to which metal layer 80 is contacted. Thus, a pair of Schottky diodes are formed across the base emitter junctions of parasitic transistors 46 and 48 as illustrated in FIG. 4. Schottky diodes 88 and 90 clamp the baseemitter junctions of transistors 48 and 46 respectively.These diodes restrict either transistor or parasitic SCR 12 from entering the active region of operation. Therefore, the current spike that can otherwise be generated in IC 10 of FIGs. 1 and 2 is inhibited by the Schottky diode clamp protection circuit. This is due to the fact that diode 88 serves to clamp the epi voltage of tub 64 to a value VN V for positive VN where VN is the input voltage present at pin 14 and is the forward voltage drop of a Schottky diode. This will be transparant during normal circuit operation, and will prevent active operation of transistor 48 when IC 10 is inadvertently operated with substrate 50 not grounded as previously described. Diode 90 is reverse biasedduriny normal operation, but will clamp the base emitter junction of transistor 46 to p when the substrate is left floating. Hence, what has been described above, is a novelSchottky diode clamp protection circuit which inhibits turn on of a parasitic SCR comprised, in part, of a diffused resistor in a floating epitaxial island in an IC due to the IC being operated with the substrate ungrounded.
