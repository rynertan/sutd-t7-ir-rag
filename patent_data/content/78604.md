# Single layer absorptive anti reflection coating for a laser addressed liquid crystal light valve.

## Abstract
A laser addressed reflective mode liquid crystal light valve includes an anti reflective coating of only a single layer of cermet which is vacuum deposited in a partial pressure of oxygen to produce a combination of chrome and chromium oxide, the single layer anti reflection coating both absorbing light at a wavelength corresponding to a laser beam wavelength and reflecting all other wavelengths with a higher reflectance. Some advantages are that fabrication is made easier by the elimination of multiple layers in the anti reflection coating while laser beam absorption is enhanced by the single layer anti reflection coating without causing a corresponding decrease in image resolution.

## Description
SINGLE LAYER ABSORPTIVE ANTI REFLECTION COATING FOR A LASER ADDRESSED LIQUID CRYSTAL LIGHT VALVE TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is related to anti reflective coatings useful for reflective mode laser addressed liquid crystal light valves. BACKGROUND ART Laser addressed reflective mode liquid crystal light valves typically include a glass layer facing a laser on on one side, the other side of the glass layer having an overlying anti reflective coating, a reflective coating deposited over the anti reflective coating and a liquid crystal layer deposited over the reflective coating. A thinly focused laser beam addresses a spot in the liquid crystal layer by penetrating through the glass layer and the anti reflective coating layer and impinging on a corresponding adjacent spot in the the reflective coating, wherein the laser beam is absorbed to generate heat.The heat causes a change in the optical properties of the addressed spot in the liquid crystal layer. A bright beam incident on the opposite side of the liquid crystal layer is reflected at the reflective layer and is modulated by the heat induced changes in the liquid crystal layer optical characteristics. A significant feature of this prior art liquid crystal light valve is that the reflective layer must perform two functions, namely the reflection of the bright beam and, simultaneously, the absorption of the laser beam to generate heat. The reflective layer typically comprises aluminum which has a relatively high heat conductivity. Accord ingly, the small spot in the aluminum reflective layer heated by the thinly focused laser beam actually spreads in time due to the thermal conductivity, thus reducing the resolution of the image written by the laser beam in the liquid crystal layer. One prior art solution to this problem is to reduce the thickness of the alumLnum layer, which has the disadvantage that the absorpton of the laser beam in the aluminum is significantly reduced, as is the reflectivtty of the aluminum layer. A significant problem in fabricating such prior art laser addressed reflective mode liquid crystal light valves is that the anti reflective coating sandwiched between the glass substrate and the aluminum reflective layer must be tuned so that reflection is minimized and transmission is maximized at the wavelength of the laser beam.It is also desirable, if ambient light is present, that the anti reflective coating have a maximum reflectance or coefficient of reflection at wavelengths other than the wavelength of the laser beam in order to filter out ambient light The difficulty in fabrication arises because such anti reflective coatings comprise a plurality ofdielectric layers, each layer having a different index of refraction, the thickness of each layer having to be precisely determined in accordance with the wavelength to be transmitted therethrough. It is exceedingly difficult to tune such a reflective coating because the thickness of each individual layer in the anti reflective coating must be predetermined prior to manufacture.Specifically, the anti reflective coating is typically deposited over the glass substrate and the aluminum reflective layer is deposited thereafter, so that it is not possible to match the anti reflective coating with the reflective layer by monitoring reflectance during deposition of the anti reflective coating. Accordingly, the presence of a plurality of dielectric layers in the anti reflective coating has made manufacture a very difficult process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a single layer combination absorption and anti reflection coating which replaces the antireflective coating of the prior art laser addressed llquid crystal light valves. An advantage of the single layer is that it greatly reduces the difficulty of manufacturing and tuning the anti reflective coating. An advantage of the dual functions of antireflection and absorption performed by the single layer anti reflection coating of this invention is that the anti reflection coating itself performs the laser beam heat absorption which, in prior art light valves, was performed instead by the reflective coating. Accordingly, the laser beam absorption may be significantly improved without having to increase the thickness of the aluminum reflective layer which would otherwise degrade image resolution . This invention not only reduces manufacturing costs by the elimination.of multiple tuned anti reflective layers but also improves performance by increasing the laser beam absorption. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, an additional chrome reflective layer is added and sandwiched between the aluminum reflective layer and the single layer antireflective coating. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is best understood by reference to the accompanying drawings, of which FIG. 1 is a simplified cross sectional view of a portion of a laser addressed reflective mode liquid crystal light valve FIG. 2 is a simplified cross sectional view of the single layer absorptive anti reflection coating used in the light valve of FIG. 1, and illustrates laser beam absorption, reflection and transmission through the single layer anti reflection coating and FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of a prior art anti reflective coating layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 illustrates in cross sectional view a portion of a laser addressed reflective mode liquid crystal light valve, including a glass substrate layer 10, an anti reflective coating 20, an aluminum reflective layer 30 and a liquid crystal layer 40. A thinly focused laser beam 44 is directed toward front face 10a of the glass substrate 10 while a bright beam 48 of visible light is directed toward back face 40a of the liquid crystal layer 40. The bright beam 48 is reflected at the reflective layer 30 so that a return bright beam 48 emerges from the back face 4Qa of the liquid crystal layer 40 and is modulated by the laser beam 44.In the prior art, this modulation occurs because the reflective layer 30 absorbs a portion of the energy from the laser beam 44, converting it to heat, so that the thinly focused laser beam 44 heats a very small region 30 of the reflective layer 30 and an adjacent region 40 of the liquid cyrstal layer 40, which changes the optical response of the adjacent region 40 to the bright beam 48. For example, the heated portion 40 of the liquid crystal layer 40 may be extremely reflective to the bright beam 48 while the remaining region of the liquid layer 40 may completely absorb the bright beam 48. The purpose of the anti reflective coating 20 is to prevent reflection of the laser beam .44 by the reflective layer 30, so that the reflective layer 30 absorbs rather than reflects the laser beam 44. FIG6 3 illustrates a typical anti reflective coating of the prior art including three layers 20 , 20 and 20 , each of the layers having indices of refraction nl, n2 and n1 respectively, their thicknesses being precisely determined in order to assure maximum trans mission to the reflective layer 30 of light of a wavelength corresponding to that of the laser beam 44. Significantly, prior art laser addressed light valves using a multi layer anti reflective coating 20 of the type illustrated in FIG. 3 are very difficult to fabricate. Specifically, the glass substrate 10 is formed first during manufacture, the anti reflective coating 20 being deposited over the glass substrate and the anti reflective coating 30 being deposited over the anti reflective coating at a later time. Consequently, the multiple layers 20 , 20 and 20 cannot be monitored during formation for their effect on the reflection of the laser beam by the reflective coating 30. Instead the thickness of each of the layers 20 , 20 , 20 must be predetermined. The presence of multiple anti reflective layers 20 , 20 and 20 makes the preselection of layer thickness, or tuning of the anti reflective coating 20, difficult and expensive in proportion to the number of layers, a significant disadvantage. Another disadvantage of such prior art laser addressed light valves is that the aluminum reflective layer 30 performs the laser beam absorption. Consequently, there exists a tradeoff between image resolution and laser beam absorption. Specifically, as the thickness of the aluminum reflective coating 30 is increased, the amount of energy absorbed from the laser beam 44 is proportionally increased an advantage while the lateral spread of heat and of the heated region 30 also increases, due to the high thermal conductivity of the aluminum material in the reflective layer 30.This lateral spreading reduces the resolution of the image produced by the heated portion 40 of the liquid crystal layer 40, a significant disadvantage. On the other hand, if the thickness of the reflective layer 30 is reduced, the image resolution is increased but the laser absorption is decreased. These problems are overcome in the present invention by the provision of a single layer absorptive antireflection coating 20a illustrated in FIG. 2, preferably coinprising cermet material, which is a mixture of chromium Cr and chromium oxide Cr203 . The single layer 20a ofFIG. 2 replaces the multi layer coating of FIG. 3 and performs dual functions of both anti reflection and laser beaiu thermal absorption. One advantage of the single layer of FIG. 2 is that fabrication and tuning is made significantly easier because there is only one layer.The advantage of the dual functions of absorption and anti reflection of the single layer 20a is that reduction in thickness of the highly conductive aluminum reflective layer 30 in order to improve image resolution does not degrade absorption, since the laser beam absorption is performed by the dual function anti reflection coating layer 20a. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a chrome layer 20b illustrated in FIG. 1 is sandwiched between the single layer anti reflection coating 20a and the aluminum reflective coating 30. FIG 2 illustrates an example of the operation of the single layer anti reflective coating of the present invention. The laser beam 44 is incident on front face 20a of the single layer anti reflection coating 20a. In this example, 20 percent of the incident beam is reflected at the front face 20a to generate a primary reflected beam of phase Blr as dictated in FIG 2.The remaining 80 percent of the beam 44 penetrates the interior of the single layer 20a Some of the penetrating beam is absorbed as it travels between the front face 20a and back face 20a so that only part of it reaches the back face 20a , In this example, it may also be assumed that approximately 5 percent of the beam is transmitted through the back face 20a , the remaining portion being reflected back through the interior of the single layer 20a.Again, some of the beam is absorbed as it travels between the back face 20a F and the front face 20a so that an even smaller portion of the beam now reaches the frontface 20razz An amount corresponding to 20 percent of the original beam is then transmitted through the front face 20a to generate a secondary reflected beam having a phase 2 2. The thickness of the single layer anti reflective coating 20a is selected to achieve the foregoing relationship between the phases 1 and 2 of the primary and secondary reflected beams, respectively. It should be understood, of course, that the percentages of reflection, transmission and absorption given in the foregoing example are arbitrary and were given only for the purpose of conceptually illustrating the operation of the single layer absorptive anti reflection coating of the invention. In general, the primary and secondary reflected beams are of the same magnitude but of opposite phase, so that total destructive interference between the two reflected beams occurs at the front face 20a , and there is, theoretically, no reflection at the front face 20a . In actual practise, however, about 4 of the laser beam is reflected or lost, the remaining 96 of the beam being absorbed in the absorptive anti reflection coating. Of course, this condition obtains only for a laser beam having a wavelength within the range to which the thickness of the layer 20a is tuned . Other wavelengths of light are nearly completely reflected at the front face 20a . Fabrication of the single layer absorptive antireflection coating 20a of FIG. 2 is accomplished by depositing chromium metal over the glass substrate 10 in the presence of oxygen and varying the deposition rate to control the degree of oxidation. Experimentally, the evaporation rate, or deposition rate, is tested to determine the rate needed to achieve the desired optical properties.THEORY OF OPERATION The optical constants for pure chromium are N 3.2, K 3.8 and for chrome oxide CR203 are N 2,1 and K .06, these constants being applicable at a wavelength of 850 nanometers. The constants N and K are the well known complex wave numbers used in the plane wave formulation of Maxwell s equations to solve for the coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption at boundaries between two dissimilar optical materials.For example, the plane wave coefficient of reflection at the interface between a vacuum and a material having optical constants N and K is given by R2 N. 1 2 K2t N 1 2 K2 . The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorbtion of the cermet layer 20a determine the percentages of reflection, transmission and absorption which were given arbitrarily in the example of FIG. 2.By varying the deposition rate and partial pressure of oxygen to vary the degree of oxidation, the proportion Qf chrome oxide and chromium in the cermet layer 20a may be xjari2d in order to achieve intermediate optical constants somewhere between the optical constants of chrome and the optical constants of chrome oxide stated above.The. constants are thus selected so that the layer 20a has a minimum coefficient of reflection and a maximum coefficient of absorbtion at the wavelength of the laser. Example 1. A reflective mode laser addressed liquid crystal light valve for use with a laser beam of wavelength 850 nanometers was constructed wherein the glass layer 10 comprised silicon dioxide, the single layer absorptive anti reflection coating 20a comprised cermet, the coating 20a was 43 nanometers in thickness, the intermediate chrome layer 20b was 32 nanometers in thickness and the aluminum reflection layer 30 was 15 nanometers in thickness.The cermet coating 20a was formed by vapor deposition of chromium metal over the glass substrate 10 in a pressure of lox10 4 torr at a deposition rate of 430 21.4 minutes in an atmosphere of 50 oxygen and 50 argon Ar wherein the glass substrate 10 was at a temperature of 1200C. It was observed that the resulting structure had 96 percent absorption of light at a wavelength of 850 nanometers and a reflectance of 87 percent of light at a wavelength of 6328 nanometers. This is the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, although it is contemplated that a skilled worker may make other embodiments of the invention not expressly described herein. Example 2. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the chromium layer 20b is eliminated, the anti reflective coating 20a directly contacting the reflective aluminum coating 30. This alternative embodiment was constructed, and the cermet layer 20a was formed by the vapor deposition of chromium onto the glass substrate 10 at o a deposition rate of 430A 26 minutes at a pressure of 1Q 4 torr in an atmosphere of 50 2 and 50 Ar wherein the glass substrate 10 was at a temperature of 120 C. The thickness of the cermet anti reflection layer 20a was 43 nanometers and the thickness of the aluminum reflection layer 30 was 15 nanometers. The resulting structure had an absorption of 94 percent of light at a wavelength of 850 nanometers and a reflectance of 87 percent of light at a wavelength of 6328 nanometers.
