# High surface area nickel aluminate spinel catalyst and steam reforming process utilizing the same.

## Abstract
A high surface area nickel aluminate spinel formed on alumina, prepared by a specified method and useful as catalyst support and as catalyst for hydrocarbon treating and conversion processes is provided. In the specified method, high surface area alumina is impregnated with a nickel salt and the impregnated alumina is calcined at from 600 to 1000 C. A steam reforming process utilizing the nickel aluminate spinel on alumina as catalyst is also provided.
