## Description
DEVICES WITH CONTROLLABLE LIGHT WAVE GUIDESField of the Invention The present invention relates to devices, such as switching devices and directional couplers, with controllable light wave guides usable in a variety of applications in light wave communications for changing the path of a light beam.Background to the Invention Hitherto, a light wave guide which can be controlled to vary its refractive index to alter the path of a light beam are either a thin film light wave guide, using electro optical crystals such as LiNbO3 or a device wherein the refractive index is altered by current injection. Thin film light wave guides of known type are disadvantageous in that the variation of the refractive index differs according to the direction of crystallization and in that the miniaturization is difficult since the necessary mirror forming electrodes must be situated on the surface of the device. Wave guides which rely on current injection are disadvantageous in that the response speed is not high because the variation of the refractive index is determined by an increase or decrease of the carrier density. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved form of device usable as a light circuit function element, for instance, as a light modulator or switch, having a high response speed for the variation of the refractive index as compared with known devices and having the capability of significant miniaturization.Summary of the Invention In one aspect the present invention provides a device usable as a controllable light wave guide composed of an extremely thin film multi layer structure forming a multiquantum well. A change in electric field in the multiquantum well causes a variation of the refractive index. A light wave or signal can thus be controlled by varying the electric field in a controlled manner. A light switching device constructed in accordance with the invention may comprise at least one light wave guide composed of an extremely thin film multi layer structure forming a multi quantum well embodied in a block witll itl at least one input, at least two outputs and a control electrode which receivies a variable voltage which is used to vary a electric field in the multi quantum well whereby to alter the refractive index af the guide to switch the light from one output to the other and vice verso A light switching device may also comprise first and second light wave guides, which intersect one another over a region composed of at least one extremely thin film multi layer structure forming a multi quantum well, an input for introducing light into the device and outputs for emitting the light from the device in different directions and a control electrode which serves to create an electric field in the multi quantum well which can be altered to change the refractive index of the intersecting region of the guides in response to the voltage applied to the control electrode to change the output from which light is emitted. A switching system with a network of individual guides forming groups of inputs and outputs can be constructed with the guides intersecting in a lattice like fashion with extremely thin film multi layer structures forming multi quantum wells at the intersections. By applying voltages to the intersecting regions light signals can be diverted from any one or more of the collective inputs to any one or more of the outputs. It is not necessary in a Il cases to have the guides intersecting. In a directional coupler, for instance, guides constructed as aforesaid have regions extending side by side and light can be diverted from one guide to the other by varying the electric field in the multi quantum well as before. Communications systems of various types can be created with light switches constructed in accordance with the invention operated in synchronism to establish communication via a common link or line. The present invention may be understood more readily, and various other aspects and features of the invention may become apparent, from consideration of the following description.Brief Description of drawings In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a cross sectional representation of a device constructed in accordance with the present invention Figures 2 and 3 are diagrams showing the variation in potential across the extremely thin film multi layer structure of the device constructed in accordance with the invention Figure 4 is a diagram showing the variation of a wave function in the well of the device Figure 5 is a diagram showing the variation of the refractive index dn n against the variation of the electric field strength in the device Figure 6 is a perspective view of the device adapted as a light switch Figure 7 is an enlarged plan view of the electrode portion of the device of Figure 6 Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor representing devices constructed in accordance with the invention Figure 9 is a diagram showing voltage characteristics of the light switching device of the present invention Figure 10 is a diagram showing the response characteristics of the light switching device Figure 11 is a diagrammatical representation of a directional coupler constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 12 is a cross sectional view of the coupler inFigure 11 Figures 13, 14 and 15 are representations of communications and switching systems constructed in accordance with the present invention. Figure 1 shows a device in the form of a controllable light wave guide constructed in accordance with the invention. The device employs a multi quantum well MQW in the form of an extremely thin film multi layer semiconductor structure provided on a semiconductor substrate 12. A typical construction has alternate films of different semiconductors such has GaAs and GaAlAsor GaInAsP and InP. The thickness of each film is 10 500A and the total number of films is the range 10 200 The device also emp loys electrodes 16, 26 to which a control voltage can be applied. As shown electrode 16 is grounded and electrode 26 is connected to a voltage V. The arrowEF in the multi quantum well MQW shows the direction of the applied electric field. Figure 2 shows a potential distribution of the multiquantum well MQW in the direction of the arrow Z of Figure 1, i.e. through the cross sectlon in a direction normal to thin film multi layer structure. In Figure 2, the upper curve C.B. designates the conduction band and the lower curve V.B. designates the valence band . In the multiquantum well MQW, narrowed portions of the both bandsC.B. and V.B. are formed at the positions of the respective thin films. Each narrowed portion is termed a well and designated by w. Figure 2 shows a case in that the applied voltage V to the electrode 26 is zero, i.e. V O and no electric field EF is present in the multiquantum well MQW. In this case, the potential distribution of the both bands C.B. and V.B. extends horizontally. Figure 3 shows the situation when a voltage V is applied to the electrode 26 i.e. V O in this case. The voltage V V O , creates an electric field in the y direction i.e. in the direction of thickness of the extremely thin films and the potential distribution thereof adppts the inclination as shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the portion of the well W of Figures 2 and 3 on an enlarged scale. By applying an electric field to the multi quantum well MQW, the wave functions of electrons in the well W are influenced and in the drawing, the wave form curves in the well W represent the wave functions, of which the dotted lines signifies V O and the full lines indicate a case of VAO i.e. V O in the illustrated case. By the deviation of the wave functions of the electrons and holes and by the variation of the energy level, the refractive index at the wells W of the multi quantum well MQW varies. Due to this phenomenon, light passed through the multi quantum well MQW can be reflected or diverted in a different direction. Figure 5 shows the relationship between the variation of the refractive index and the applied electric field strength. In Figure 5, the electric field strength E KV cm is taken on the abscissa and the rate of variation of the refractive index n n n is taken on the ordinate. In Figure 5 Ag denotes the wavelength of forbidden band width a denotes the width of a well n denotes the refractive index and denotes the optical confinement factor As can be seen from Figure 5, the refractive index n decreases An as the electric field strength E becomes larger. Figure 6 shows one embodiment of a device according to the present invention usable as a light switch in perspective view. Figure 7 is a plan view of the control electrode region of the device and Figure 8 can be taken as representing a cross sectional view of the electrode region of the switching device or other device using the multi quantum well MQW light guide. In Figures 6 to 8, the reference numeral 10 designates the general structure of the light switching device and MQW again designates the multi quantum well having the extremely thin film multi layer structure effectively forming two alternative output guide paths OI and OII for light. Figure 8 shows the device in more detail. The semiconductor substrate 12 is of n type and an n layer 14 having high impurity concentration is located between the substrate 12 and the electrode 16 at the base of the device which is at earth potential. Reference numeral 18 designates an insulator layer, 20 is a p type layer and 22 is a p type layer, an insulating layer 24 CSiO2 is provided at the upper region of the device except for the electrode connection of the p layer 22. The electrode 26 is provided over the p layer 22 and voltage V V 0 is applied thereto.This voltage V is used in a reverse bias condition but it is possible to adopt an inverse semiconductor structure with p type substrates 12, 14 and n type substrates 29, 22 and to adopt a positive bias voltage V 0 . As shown in Figures 6 and 7, if the applied voltage V to the electrode 26 is 0, i.e.V O, light LIN injected into the well MQW from one end of the device forming an input 28 propagates linearly from the input 28 though the light wave guide and is emitted as output light LOI from the light output path OI. When the applied voltage V is changed as Vp0r i.e. V O , the refractive index of the light wave guide in the region located below the electrode 26 shown in Figure 7 becomes smaller and the incident light is diverted to emerge as light output LOII from the light output path Oil. Thus by controlling the voltage V the input Lin can be switched between the outputs LOI, toil. The response speed of this device is substantially higher than the conventional system using relaxation time of electrons in the energy band. Figure 9 shows the relationship between the applied voltage V, i.e. V O and the ratio of the output light intensity P Pi wherein Pi is the light intensity of the input ight, P,1 is the light intensity of the output light L0I at the output of the first light wave guide OI and P02 is the light intensity of the output light LoII at the output of the second light wave guide OII. High speed switching between the light wave guides is possible for a small change in applied voltage as can be seen from Figure 9.Figure 10 depicts the response time characteristics with the time t plotted on the abscissa. As can be seen, the first light output signal LOI is cut off by the application of the voltage V to the electrode 26 and the second light output L0II is established. Conversely, by making the applied voltage zero V O , the first light output signal LOI is established and the second light output signal LoII is cut off. Several practical applications of the device will now be described. In Figure 13 a plurality of light wave guide switching devices constructed in the manner shown in Figures 6 to 7 are arranged as a lattice network. Each of the circles SW shown at junctions of the ight wave guides is a light switching device. In this hybrid system a light signal group consisting of a number of first light signals transmitted from a number of first light inputs INPUT l and a number of second light signals transmitted from a number of second light inputs INPUT 2 can be switched severally and collectively between groups of outputs OUT1, OUT 2. In Figures Il and 12 two light wave guides constructed as described previously, are arranged to extend partly parallel and side by side as shown. By varying the refractive index and hence the propagation constant of the two light wave guides with the voltages V1, V2 applied to control electrodes 30, 32, the light wave guides can be switched based on the general principle of a directional coupler. As appears from a comparison between Figures 8 and 12 the coupler is constructed in a similar fashion to the basic switching device. When an incident light LIN at INPUT I is propagated in the first light wave guide, a voltage V1 applied to the control 30 of the first guide and a voltage V2 applied to the control electrode 31 of the several guide are suitably selected to cause a difference in the propagation constants of the two light wave guides over the parallel portions and by this incident light may be guided to emerge as a LOl at the output OUT I or LOII at the ouputOUT 2. Similarly incident light at INPUT I can be transferred from OUT 2 to OUT I and vice versa. For example Vl off V2 off IN Ol V1 on V2 off IN Oil The above explained embodiment is just one example of a practical application of the present invention, and the operating conditions may be different according to the voltages V1 and V2 and the shape of the coupler. Figure 14 shows diagrammatically a system for effecting time sharing light communication Here a group of input sIN are connected to a common transmission line or link via switching devices indicated by the circles and this line or link is connected via further switching devices to a group of outputs OUT. By switching the light switchesSWIn at the input side and the light switches SWOn at the output side in synchronism, time sharing or time division light communication may be effected Based on the same principle, by synchronizing operation of the light switches in the transmitter side and in the receiving side, two way communication of signals can be effected simultaneously by using a single light communication link or line and Figure 15 shows such an embodiment. In Figure 15, LT1 is a first transmitting light signal, LR1 is a first receiving light signal at the remote side, LT2 is a second transmitting signal sent from the remote side, and LR2 is a second receiving light signal. SW and SW designate light switches operating in synchronism.
