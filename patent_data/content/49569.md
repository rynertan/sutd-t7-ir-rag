# Buffering speech signals in a TASI system.

## Abstract
A time assignment speech interpolation TASI system includes a speech buffer 110 comprising storage packets which are assigned to the individual channels 100 as required for the storage of the signals of each off hook channel. For each inactive channel, the signals are stored sequentially and cyclically in one packet. When the channel becomes active, the sequential storage of signals continues in this and in further packets as required, signals stored before detection that the channel had become active being retained in the first packet to accommodate the response time of a speech detector 109 of the system. Clipping of speech signals is thereby avoided. The channel is assigned a transmission facility 101 and channel to facility assignment information is transmitted 114, 104 , following which the signals of the relevant channel are read sequentially from the buffer packets and transmitted via the facility. Freeze out of speech signals is reduced because there is a variable delay between storage of signals in the buffer and reading therefrom reading takes place only after a transmission facility has become available and has been assigned to the channel. At the end of each speech burst an end of record signal is stored in the buffer following the last signal of the channel this is detected on reading from the buffer to terminate the reading and to indicate that the facility is available for a new assignment. Rapid updating of packets for writing into and reading from the buffer is achieved by assigning, to each channel or facility for which storage or reading is taking place, not only a current packet of the buffer which is currently being used for storage or reading, but also a back up packet which is the next packet to be used for the storage or reading operation.
