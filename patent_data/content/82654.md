## Description
APPARATUS FOR AND A METHOD OF COATING A LENGTH OF MATERIAL. The present invention relates to apparatus for and a method of coating a length of material by vacuum deposition. In one such apparatus, the length of material is fed from a supply or pay off reel past a source of evaporated metal to a take up reel in a vacuum chamber. As the material, which is usually synthetic plastics material, passes by the source, evaporated metal, usually aluminium, condenses on the material to form a metal coating. The characteristics of the coating are controlled manually by the operator of the apparatus by appropriate alteration of the metallising process variables.This requires the close and substantially continuous attendance of a skilled operative. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for coating a length of material comprising a vacuum chamber housing supply means for the supply of the length of material to be coated, a source of coating material, take up means for receiving the length of coated material, and a monitor for monitoring the coating process and control means operative to receive signals from the monitor and to vary the process variables in dependence upon the signals received in order to secure desired coating characteristics. A preferred embodiment of the apparatus may comprise any one or more of the following advantageous features a The monitor comprises a transmitter disposed on one side of the length of material and a receiver disposed on the other side of the material to receive a signal from the transmitter transmitted through the material. b The monitor comprises a transmitter disposed adjacent the path followed, in operation of the machine, by the length of material and a receiver also dis posed adjacent that path but spaced from the transmitter to receive signals from the transmitter reflected by the material. c The monitor comprises a series of transmitters disposed on one side of the length of material and a series of receivers disposed on the other side of the material to receive signals from the transmitters transmitted through the material. d The monitor comprises a series of transmitters disposed adjacent the path followed, in operation of the machine, by the length of material and a series of receivers also disposed adjacent that path but spaced from the transmitters to receive signals from the transmitters reflected by the material. e The monitor comprises a transmitter and a receiver spaced from the transmitter, and is disposed to monitor the density of a cloud of coating material emanating, in operation of the machine, from the source of coating material and thereby to monitor the thickness of metal coating produced thereby. f The monitor comprises a series of transmitters and a series of receivers spaced from the transmitters and is disposed to monitor the density of a cloud of coating material emanating, in operation of the machine, from the source of coating material and thereby to monitor the thickness of metal coating produced thereby. g The or each receiver of the monitor of b or d is provided with circuitry set to respond to electrical signals produced by received transmitted or reflected signals of a particular fre quency, the frequency being chosen having regard to a desired colouration effect. h The or each receiver is provided with circuitry set to respond to electrical signals produced by received transmitted or reflected signals of a particular frequency. i The or each transmitter is a phototrans istor. j The or each receiver is a photocell. k The control means comprises a micro processor. 1 The control means is operative to control the speed of operation of means for receiving the length of coated material. m The control means is operative to control the rate of supply of coating material. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of coating a length of material including the steps drawing the material past a source of coating material in a vacuum, monitoring the thickness of a coating produced thereby and automatically controlling the process variables in order to maintain the coating thickness at a chosen nominal value. The invention also comprises coated material produced with the above described apparatus or method. In the specification the term vacuum is used to encompass pressures less than the normal ambient pressure appropriate to the coating process. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, one embodiment thereof will now be des cribbed, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a front elevational view in section of a web metallising apparatus, Figure 2 shows diagrammatically a monitor forming part of the apparatus of Figure 1 with associated control circuitry, and Figure 3 shows diagrammatically an end elevational view of a modification of the monitor shown in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the web metallising apparatus comprises a vacuum chamber 1 housing a metal usually aluminium vapour source 2, a pay off or supply reel 3 a driven take up reel 4 and a driven water cooled drum 5. The web referenced W in Figure 1 follows a complex path defined by a series of guide rolls in conjunction with the surface of drum 5 from the supply reel 3 to the take up reel 4. The guide rolls are indicated generally by the reference G in Figure 1. In operation, untreated web is fed from the supply reel 3 and is cooled as it passes over the working surface of the water cooled drum 5. As it passes over this working surface a cloud of metal vapour condenses on the surface of the web facing the source 2. The metallised web then passes to the take up reel 4. The characteristics of the coating are monitored by means of a monitor 6 disposed between the driven water cooled drum 5 and the take up reel 4. Referring to Figure 2, this monitor 6 comprises ten phototransistors T1 to T1O arranged in line but regularly spaced from one another on one side of the metallised web W and ten photocells C1 to ClO also arranged correspondingly in line but regularly spaced fron one another on the other side of the metallised web W. The phototransistors T1 to TlO are activated to emit light signals of a particular frequency and the photocells are provided with circuitry set to respond to electrical signals corresponding to light signals of that frequency. Variations in ambient light conditions therefore do not effect the system. The amount of light emanating from the phototransistors Tl to T10 which is transmitted by the web to the photocells Cl to Clo depends upon the thickness of the coating of metal on the web. The signal generated by each of the photocells is therefore a measure of the coating thickness of the metal coating on the web adjacent that photocell. The signals from the photocells are fed to a control 20. The function of the control 20 is to analyse the signals received and issue instructions to vary the metallising process variables in order to secure the desired coating thickness across the width of the web W. The main metallising process variables are the web speed and the amount of metal vapourised per unit time.This latter variable is in turn dependant upon the aluminium wire feed speed to the vapour source and upon the temperature of the source. Pressure within the vacuum chamber 1 also effects metallising. The metal vapour source 2 comprises six individual molten metal baths B1 to B6. These baths are of course displaced from the monitor 6 as shown in Figure 1, but they have been superimposed on Figure 2 in order to show their postion in relation to the web as compared with the position in relation to the web of the photocells and phototransistors of the monitor. There is a metal wire feed 21 to each of these baths B1 to B6 and the speed of each feed is controlled by signals issuing from control 20. Similarly, the power supply 22 to the baths B1 to B6 can be varied in order to vary the temperature of each bath and the amount of power supplied is also controlled by signals issued by control 20. Web speed is controlled by controlling the speed of the water cooled drum 5.The drive for this water cooled drum 5 is represented diagrammatically on Figure 2 at 23. This drive 23 is arranged to receive control signals from the control 20. The control 20 comprises a microprocessor although controls of less complexity would be used.In operation of the apparatus the desired nominal thickness of the metal coating and the acceptable tolerances are chosen. The microprocessor is pro grammed to alter the metallising process variables described above in order to maintain the coating thickness substantially at the chosen value and within the accepted tolerances band. If, for example, coating thickness begins to exceed or fall below the chosen value at a point within the width of the web the aluminium wire feed can be reduced or increased respectively to the molten metal bath most closely adjacent that bath. If, on the other hand, the coating thickness across the whole width of the web exceeds or falls below the chosen value it may be more appropriate to increase or reduce respectively the speed of the web.In practice the microprocessor will continuously receive signals from all of the photocells and compute the values of the process variable in accordance with its program necessary to ensure that coating thickness remains at the selected nominal value and within the allowable tolerance band. These process variable values are in turn continuously fed to those parts of the apparatus provided for altering the process variables in question. A modification of the monitoring system is diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 3. In this modified system a line of receivers 3C and a line of corresponding transmitters 3T spaced from the line of receivers are both disposed in the same side of the length of material being monitored and the receivers receive the signals reflected by the web as diagrammatically indicated in Figure 3 by lines I and R. The degree of re election of the incident signal I will be governed by the coating on the web and in particular by the thickness of that coating. This modified system is intended to cater for those cases where a more accurate thickness reading can be obtained by a reflected signal than by a transmitted signal. In all other respects the system of Figure 3 is the same as that of Figure 2.Both the systems ofFigures 2 and 3 can be set up to cater for received signals of a particular frequency and in that way colouration effects of the coating on the web and in particular, any deviation therefrom can be monitored. This would normally be achieved by connecting appropriate circuitry to the receivers C1 to C10 or 3C provided, preferably, with means for adjusting the frequency responded to. The thickness of the coating on the web can also be monitored, in conjunction with web speed, by monitoring the density of the cloud of metallising vapour between the source of the vapour and the surface of the web W. A possible position for a line of transmitters and a line of receivers of this type of monitor is illustrated at T and C in Figure 1. As with the previously described embodiments, the transmitters and receivers of the respective lines are spaced across the width of the web W. In other respects this type of monitor is similar to the previously described monitor, in particular having circuitry associated with the transmitters and receivers for processing the signals received and producing control signals therefrom. It will be appreciated that the above embodiments have been described by way of example only and that many variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention.
