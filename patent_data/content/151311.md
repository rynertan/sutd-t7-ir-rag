# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
A radiation detector comprises an elongated strip 30 of semiconductor material which is photoconductive by the generation of electron and hole photocarriers when an image is moved along the strip. The strip includes an active region 55 and a readout region 56 . A first bias current I1 is applied through the active region 55 of the strip 30 thereby producing an ambipolar drift of photocarriers in the strip whose velocity substantially matches the velocity of the movement of the image along said strip. A second bias current I2 is applied to the readout region 56 of the strip so that the drift of the photocarriers in the readout region has a velocity which is greater than the velocity of the drift of the photocarriers in the active region of the strip, thereby decreasing the time for readout.
