# INVERTER VARIABLE DEAD TIME FOR X RAY GENERATOR

## Abstract
In an X ray generator system having a pulse width modulated transistor inverter with associated flywheel diodes, method and apparatus is provided to sense when a diode associated with a non pulse width modulated transis tor is conducting and for inhibiting the turning on of that transistor during such period, to thereby avoid the transis tion from reverse conduction to direct conduction in an uncontrolled manner.
