# Inverter power supply capable of operation at high frequencies.

## Abstract
An inverter power supply has a field effect transistor 16 as its switching device. Control pulses from a pulse transfor mer T1 are applied to the gate electrode through a transistor circuit comprising a transistor Q2P with its base connected to the secondary of the pulse transformer and its emitter collector circuit forming a discharge path for the gate capacitance. On the termination of a control pulse, the transistor Q2P becomes conducting and rapidly discharges the gate capacitance of the field effect transistor, causing it to switch off very rapidly. A second transistor Q2N may have its base connected to the output of the pulse transfor mer and its emitter collector circuit connected between the gate electrode of the field effect transistor and a source of potential, so that on arrival of a pulse it becomes conducting and rapidly charges the gate capacitance of the field effect transistor 16 , causing it to switch on very rapidly. The potential source may be a capacitor C1 whose potential is maintained in operation by base collector current flowing in the second transistor Q2N . The circuit is constructed throughout of elements capable of operating at very high frequencies.
