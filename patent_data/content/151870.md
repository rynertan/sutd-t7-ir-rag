# Gate array integrated circuit using schottky barrier FETs.

## Abstract
A gate array integrated circuit in which gate cells 11 are each composed of a DCFL circuit using Schottky barrier FETs. A plurality of basic gate cells is arrayed in one direction to form a basic call array 10 , and such basic cell arrays are arranged parallel to each other. VDD lines 12 and GND lines 13 are provided to apply an operating voltage to the basic gate cells. In order to stably operate the gate array integrated circuit of DCFL structure in which the logic swing and noise margin are small, the VDD lines 12 and the GND lines 13 are arranged perpendicular to each other such that the number of the basic gate cells 11 which are connected to each of the VDD lines is larger than that of the basic gate cells 11 which are connected to each of the GND lines 13 . According to this layout, the potential difference voltage drop developed in the GND lines by operation current is reduced.
