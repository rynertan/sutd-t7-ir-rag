DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to the figures and, in particular, toFigure 1, there is shown a mobile maintenance stand 10 which has disposed between a pair of articulated arms 12 an ejection seat 14 shown in broken lines. The lower portion of the articulated arms 12 are coupled, via a gearbox mechanism 16 and bracket assembly 18 to a flat plate or upper base portion 20 which is rotatably mounted upon a lower base portion 22 and is provided with a plurality of radially extending arms 24,.26, 28, and 30. Each of the extendable arms 24, 26, 28, and 30 are provided with a first section 32, 34, 36, and 38, respectively, which preferably are hollow and rectangularly shaped when viewed in cross section. The reason for them being hollow will be explained hereinafter. The arm sections 32, 34, 36, and 38 telescope within arms 24, 26, 28, and 30, respectively, and may be extended outwardly therefrom in order to provide additional stability for the mobile maintenance stand 10. At the underside of each of the arm sections a wheel assembly 40, 42, 44, and 46 is provided. Each wheel assembly includes a pneumatic tire 48, 50, 52, and 54 and a braking mechanism 56, 58, 60 and 62 of a conventional design which may be used to inhibit the rotation of the wheels thereby preventing movement of the maintenance stand as desired. Arm sections 32, 34, 36, and 38 when fully extended provide additional bracing for the mobile maintenance stand thereby reducing any sway or instability which may be present.Additional sections may be inserted into each of the extending arm sections, as will be explained hereinafter, when the crane assembly 100 is utilized on the mobile maintenance stand as will be described in conjunction with Figures 8 and 9. Extending in a horizontal plane transverse to each of the arms 24, 26, 28 and 30 is an outwardly extending rectangularlyshaped protruding member 64, 66, 68, and 70 which is adapted to receive and cooperate with a screw jack 72, 74, 76, and 78. The screw jacks extend, when aligned in a vertical direction, downwardly beyond the circumference of tires 48, 50, 52 and 54 when adjusted by means of crank handles 80, 82, 84 and 86 thereby providing rigid stability for the mobile maintenance stand 10. It is also possible to utilize the screw jacks 72, 74, 76 and 78 at the distal end of a second extending arm section 88 which may be utilized with each of arm sections 32, 34, 36, and 38 to further increase the stability of the mobile maintenance stand to its fully extended position when utilized together with the crane assembly 100 See Figure 3 .Rotation of the crank handles 80, 82, 84 and 86 provide adjustment in the direction of arrow 90 thereby raising the mobile platform so that the tires are not in contact with the ground or surface 92. The screw jacks 72, 74, 76 and 78 may also be removed and rotated 90 degrees in the direction of arrow 98 and be tucked in, out of the way, permitting movement of the mobile maintenance stand along a flat surface for transportation of an ejection seat 14 mounted thereon See Figure 6 . Referring now to Figure 3 which shows an enlarged pictorial representation of the mobile maintenance stand 10 with the first and second arm sections 32, 34, 36, 38 and sections 88, respectively, fully extended and screw jack 78 inserted on the distal end of second arm section 88 to provide a rigid stable maintenance stand and platform onto which the crane assembly 100 may be installed. The articulated arms 12 includes an upper section 94 and a lower section 96. The arm upper section 94 may be rotated in the direction of arrow 98 by the rotation of handle 102 which is removably affixed to worm gear 104. Worm gear 104 is in intimate cooperating contact with worm wheel 106 as is shown in Figure 4, and is caused to rotate as crank handle 102 rotates.The hub 108 of worm wheel 106 is provided with teeth upon which a link chain 110 is mounted. The other end of chain 110 circumscribes a chain driven gear 112 which is affixed to the axle 114 provided on the upper section 94 of the articulated arms 12 thereby providing angular rotation as indicated by the arrow 98.The chain 110 is held taut at all times by utilization of a coil spring 116 affixed to the ends of chain 110. Hub 108 of worm gear 106 is affixed on a shaft 118 that extends horizontally through axle 120 and gear box 16 to the other articulated arm 12 comprising upper section 94 and lower section 96 and, thus, both upper sections 94 and 94 of the articulated arms 12 are caused to rotate in unison. A gearbox mechanism 16 controls the movement of the lower sections 96 and 96 of articulated arms 12 in the direction of arrow 122 by the turning of crank handle 124. The rotation of upper base portion 20 in the horizontal plane is accomplished by the rotation of crank handle 124 which is affixed upon a driveshaft 126 having a worm gear 128 disposed thereon in intimate cooperating contact with worm wheel 130 which in turn is geared to upper base portion or plate 20 in a conventional manner. Thus, rotation of crank 124 will cause the plate 20 to rotate 360 degrees in the horizontal plane taking with it the articulated arms 12 and an ejection seat which may be mounted thereon as shown in Figures 7a, 7b and 7c. Figure 5 discloses the mobile antenna stand without the crane apparatus 100 in a collapsed or folded position for transportation and or storage and Figure 6 shows the position of the screw jacks 72, 74, 76, and 78 in position for transportation of the mobile stand 10. Referring now to Figures 8 and 9, there is shown a crane assembly 100 mounted on a mobile maintenance stand. Figure 8 discloses a crane assembly having 4 telescoping sections 132, 134, 136, and 138 in their fully extended position and the crane assembly 100 tilted at an angle from the vertical in order to permit the boom portion 140 of the crane assembly 100 to extend outwardly over the cockpit of an aircraft not shown.The distal, outwardly extending end 142 is provided with a pulley arrangement over which is placed a cable 144 and hook 146 affixed thereto which is adapted to engage and eye bolt 148 generally provided on the ejection seat 14 The cable 144 extends around the end pulley 142 and through the telescoping sections 132, 134, 136, and 138 of crane assembly 100 where it is affixed to a conventional ratcheted raising and lowering mechanism 150 which may be either manually operated or motor driven. The hook 146 is connected to the eye bolt 148 while the ejection seat 14 is positioned in an aircraft, not shown.Once the ejection seat 14 is released from the aircraft by removal of the retaining bolts, the crane operator may lift the seat out of the cockpit away from the aircraft and lower it until the seat is received between the articulated arms 12 provided on the mobile maintenance stand as shown in Figure 9. The apertures 152 and 154 provided in the upper section 94 of the articulated arms 12 permit the use of retaining devices, e.g. bolts , not shown, similar to that utilized to affix the ejection seat 14 in the airplane s cockpit.The hook 146 may then be removed from eye bolt 148 and the crane assembly 100 removed from the maintenance stand 10 permitting rotation of the ejection seat 14 so that the maintenance thereon may be performed by a maintenance mechanic. Positioning of the ejection seat 14 may be accomplished as shown in Figure 7a, 7b and 7c. The lower portion 156 of the crane assembly 100 includes handle 158 affixed on a shaft and gearing mechanism, not shown,Which permits for the tilting of the crane assembly 100 off its normal vertical alignment. By turning crank handle 158 and extending screw member 160 is caused to exert pressure against the retaining bracket 162 thereby tilting the crane assembly 100 away from the vertical position. This is accomplished by rotating the crane assembly 100 about its pivotal axis 120 which is more clearly seen by referring to Figure 12. Referring now to Figures 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, there is shown the detailed construction of the crane assembly 100, more specifically the lower portion 156 thereof and its mounting upon the mobile maintenance stand 10. The lowest section 138 of the crane assembly 100 is provided with a pair of pivotal arms 164 which extend outwardly from section 138 and at right angles to. both the longitudinal and transverse axis thereof. Its position is chosen to be slightly at or above the center gravity of the crane assembly when the sections 132, 134, and 136 are in their fully collapsed position and within section 138. A dolly 166 having extending arms 168 and 170.is provided with an inwardly extending holding member 172 that contains a generally semi circularly shaped depression 174 adapted to loosely receive pivotal arms 164 therein. Thus, the crane assembly may be stored in either the horizontal or vertical position when removed from he mobile maintenance stand 10 and the arms 168 and 170 may be positioned to receive the pivotal arms 164.Turning of crank andle 176 of dolly 166 will permit the arms 168 and 170 to raise Lhe crane assembly 100 from its resting position and by virtue of the pivotal arms being at or above the center of gravity of the rane assembly will cause the lower portion 156 to move slowly to downward position as shown in Figure 10. The forward arms 178 and 180 of the lower portion 150 of the crane assembly 100 are provided with latching swing arms 182 and 184 and locking echanisms 186 and 188 of conventional design. In order to place the crane assembly 100 onto the maintenance stand 10, it is necessary to move the dolly in close proximity with the stand 10 so that the arms 178 and 180 are brought proximate to the axle 120 on the maintenance stand 10.Latching swing arms 182 and 184 are brought beneath axle 120 and raised therearound where they are in position by locking mechanisms 186 and 188 by merely turning the threaded knobs 190 and 192 provided thereon until the swing arms 182 and 184 are firmly retained in position. The extending eye 194 provided in screw member 160 is placed within retaining bracket 162 and a removable pin 196 is placed in the aligning, aperture provided in bracket 162 thereby retaining the crane assembly in position on the mobile maintenance stand. If the crane member 100 is to be removed from the stand, this procedure is reversed. In operation, the crane assembly 100 is affixed to the mobile maintenance stand as described hereinbefore. The crane is fully extended and the mobile maintenance stand and crane apparatus is moved towards the aircraft from which the ejection seat 14 is to be removed. After connection of the hook 146 to the eye bolt 148 provided on the ejection seat, the ejection seat is released from the aircraft and the crane is then utilized to remove the seat therefrom. Once the seat is free and clear of the aircraft, it is lowered into position where it may be retained by the articulated arms provided on the maintenance stand. The hook 146 is then removed from the ejection seat 14 and the crane retracted to its collapsed position.The dolly 166 is then brought close to the maintenance stand so that the arms 168 and 170 thereof can permit holding mechanism 172 to come into contact with pivotal arms 164. Pin 196 is then removed from eye 194 of the screw member 160 and the latching swing arms 182 and 184 is released so that the dolly may now raise the crane assembly 100 awçy from the mobile maintenance stand 10 and separate the two, members. Maintenance technicians are then free to position the ejection seat 14 in any manner suitable for performing their tasks. Hereinbefore has been disclosed a mobile maintenance stand and crane apparatus which is lightweight, transportable, and utilizable in the field with a minimum of manpower. It will be understood that various changes in the details, materials, arrangements of parts and operating conditions which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention.
