# AC bias data recording apparatus and method of AC bias data recording.

## Abstract
In a data recording system employing an AC bias signal that is superimposed on the data signal, the AC bias signal is phase modulated to compensate for the difference in the phase angle between the alternating bias and the data signals. A closed loop phase locked oscillator 16 generates an AC bias signal at a frequency which is a multiple of a high frequency data recording signal. A phase modulator 20 modulates the AC bias signal so that the AC bias signal and the data recording signal are in phase at every transition of the data recording signal. Delay means 24 delays the data recording signal to compensate for the time displacement in the phase modulator 20 . Driver means 22, 26 apply the phase modulated AC bias signal and the delayed data recording signal simultaneously to a magnetic transducer ihead 28 .
