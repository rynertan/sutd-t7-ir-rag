## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING FLOWRATE OF ELECTROSAGETIC GRANULAR MEDIATECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an improved metering device and method of measuring the flow rate of metallic granular media, and more particularly to the flow of such media in shot peening equipment.BACKGROUND ART In prior practice, the flow of this material has commonly been measured by such means as weighing the amount of material delivered during a given period of operation of the peening equipment. This produces only an approximate result, since in a gravity fed device the flow may vary with the amount of head of the supply, and may also vary with variations,in the air pressure at the delivery nozzle. Another method of determining flow has been the use of valving means operable at different rates in the supply line, such as a cylindrical rotary valve having transverse bores in intermittent communication with the supply and delivery ports. Such a method is limited by the speed at which the valve can be rotated and by the number of transverse bores which can be provided. The device is also expensive to fabricate, owing to the necessity of precision machining. It is the purpose of tbis invention to overcome such drawbacks by means providing a substan tidily constant flow rate, and electrical means for reading the rate of continuous flow.SUMMARY In the currently developing use of shotpeening to increase fatigue life, to increase resist ance to stress corrosion, and for shaping metal parts to critical dimensions, it is desirable to have continuous indication during operation of the flow rate of the peening media, in order that all portions of the work object may be subjected to equal treatment. This invention provides a measuring system and equipment for constant determination of the rate of flow of granular ferromagnetic material, such as steel shot, primarily in a low velocity peening system with packed transfer lines. The peening unit has a continuous supply of media, gravity fed from a hopper, which media pass through a filtering element to control head pressure, and subsequently through a cylindrical element surrounded by a transducer coil connected to a suitable current supply and to a suitable electrical readout system whereby the flow rate can be read on a graph plotted with the weight of shot passing through the system during any desired increment of time at the signal level produced by the system If desired, the system may be adapted by data logger or micro processor to read directly in pounds or kilograms per minute, It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an improved method of determining the flow rate of granular ferromagnetic material, Another object is to provide a device for controlling head pressure from the hopper. It is another object to provide an improved metering device for measuring continuous flow of ferromagnetic particles, A further object of the invention is to provide a system for reading the flow rate of ferromagnetic particles during operation of a shot peening equipment Other objects and advantages will become apparent on reading the following description in connection with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a block representation of the peening system of the invention with the associated electrical equipment Fig. 2 is a sectional elevation of the head pressure filter which is positioned below the hopper Fig. 3 is a sectional elevation on a transducer flow meter which is positioned below the filter and Fig. 4 is an elevation of the transducer with associated electrical equipment.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In Fig. 1 there is shown a block representation of a shot peening apparatus constructed according to the invention, a hopper, pot or other suitable reservoir means serves as a source of supply of ferromagnetic granular media, the hopper being constantly replenished by media which have passed through the system and are returned by any convenient means, such as a conveyor belt, for example not shown . The granular media, in this case steel shot of suitable size selected for the operation to be performed, pass downward by gravity through a head pressure filter which compensstes for varying head in the hopper. The shot discharges downward from the filter into an inductive flow rate transducer which meters the rate of flow passing to the discharge nozzle and impinging on the workpiece. An electrical signal is transmitted by the transducer to a signal conditioner and ultimately. to a recorder on which the signal level may be read, and then referred to the chart on which the corresponding flowrate is plotted. Fig. 2 shows the head pressure filter 14 in cross section. A tube or sleeve 12 connects the hopper not shown to the filter and serves as a transfer line to feed the granular media to the filter. A secohd tube 13 extends downward from the filter and passes the media to the transducer which serves as a metering device.All tubes and partitions in this embodiment were formed of polyvinyl chloride plastic, cemented together to form a continuous passage or transfer line, but other substances will serve. The filter 14 comprises a chamber formed of an outer tube 16 with a smaller concentrically disposed inner tube 17, the upper end of tube 16 having a closure plate 18 with an axial bore therethrough in which the inner tube 17 is mounted and provides communication with the interior of sleeve 12. The wall of the central tube 17 has a plurality of vertical slots 19 therethrough for the passage of shot, the head pressure being rendered substantially constant by the controlling slots 19. As shown, there are four such slots disposed 900 apart, but a greater or lesser number symmetrically disposed are serviceable. The bottom end of tube 17 is provided with a closure 21 so that shot entering the open top end must discharge transversely through the slots into the annular chamber surrounding tube 17.The dotted line 22 shows approximately the level to which the filter would be filled with shot. It has been found convenient to use an outer tube having twice the inner diameter of that of the inner tube, but this is not a critical ratio Shot from the annular chamber passes on into thc transfer line through the open lower end of tube 16. In Fig. 3 there is shown the metering device 24, disposed a short distance downstream from the head pressure filter and in communication therewith through sleeve 13. In general form, the meter 24 is similar to the the filter but is of different function. It comprises an outer tube 26 having at its top end a closure 27 having an axial bore therethrough, with an inner tube 28 mounted therein and communicating with the filter through sleeve 13. Tube 28 has a plurality of bores 29 through the wall, disposed in four vertical rows 900 apart and providing communication between the interior of tube 28 and the annular chamber surrounding it. A closure 31 is provided at the downstream end of tube 28, so that media entering the top end discharge transversely through bores 29, as indicated by the dotted arrows 32. The bores are staggered so that no two bores are in the same transverse plane, to provide substantially uniform shot flow into the annular chamber between the two tubes, and the diameter of the bores is chosen appropriately for the size of shot to be used. In the embodiment shown, the shot used was of .011 diameter and the bores of 11 32 diameter, but this is not a fixed ratio. Appropriate proportions would be chosen from such considera tins as maximum flow rate desired, overall physical size of the equipment, and the degree of resolution desired. As in the case of the filter, a convenient proportion for the tubes of the transducer is an outer tube 26 having an inner diameter twice the inner diameter of tube 28. An induction coil 33 surrounds the outer tube 26 of the flow meter and is provided with current as shown schematically in Fig. 4, A range of 1 to 10 volts volts at 60hz is a suitable operating voltage, with 3 to 4 volts being preferred, There is no appreciable magnetic effect on the shot up to about 8 volts. With appropriate electrical equipment much higher frequencies may be used, from 1 to 100Khz, which allows low current. When the transducer is in a static condition, as at startup, it will be practically full of shot, as indicated by the dotted line 34 in Fig. 4.As an example, in the full condition the coil 33 of meter 24 may draw approximately 100 milliamperes at 4 volts at 60 cycles. As the shot loading drops, the current drawn increases proportionately, to the normal working shot level indicated generally by the dotted line 36 of Fig. 4. With no shot in the system, full saturation is reached and the current drawn may be as high as 200 milliamperes or more. It is to be understood that this is an example only, depending on the characteristics of the coil used, and is not a limitation of the invention Fig. 4 also shows an option which may be used.In addition to the working coil 24 through which the shot passes to the nozzle, there may be provided a balancing. coil 37 in the circuit which is of the same form and size as the working coil but which has closed ends and is filled with shot. The balancing coil, if used, will boost the usable signal it creates a null effect in the static condition, resulting in a greater change of current drawn from the static to dynamic condition, when used with the center tap transformer 39. Such larger range of current permits more precise calibration of the signal output in relation to the flow rate. The balancing coil 37 is a static coil as shown in Fig. 4, but a second coil 24 may be used dynamically in series with the first coil 24, receiving the shot from the first coil and passing it along the supply line to the nozzle. However, the same result may be achieved more simply by merely increasing the length of the transducer coil. The principle of operation of the flow rate transducer is that when the current drawn by the coil is applied to the load resistor 38, Ohmts law, E I x R, applies. R being a constant, as the current increases, the voltage will increase proportionately. The signal voltage across the resistor 38 provides a voltage signal input to the signal conditioner Fig. 1 . The signal output of the transducer thus produces a change related to the change of level of shot as the flow rate changes.Hence, flow rate may be read directly on the recorder.
