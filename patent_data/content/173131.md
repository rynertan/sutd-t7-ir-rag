# Process for separating nitroaromatic compounds from spent nitric acid.

## Abstract
This invention pertains to a process for extracting a nitroaromatic composition from a nitration medium contain ing nitric acid, water, and nitroaromatic. The process com prises contacting the nitration medium with nitric oxide under conditions such that the nitric oxide will react with the nitric acid to form nitrogen dioxide and water. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide is removed from the reaction medium and accordingly, the dissolved nitroaromatic present in the nitration medium separates to form an organic phase which then can be removed by decantation. Typically, one mole of nitric oxide is added to the nitration medium for every two moles of nitric acid present in said medium. Reaction con ditions normally are from about 0 to 90 C.
