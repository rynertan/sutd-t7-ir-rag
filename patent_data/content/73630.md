# Apparatus for external control of computer program flow.

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with controlling the execution and content of computer programs in equip ment containing a computer by causing the transfer of program data elements, including computer instructions, with a memory means of the apparatus, wherein the selection of data for transfer is effected either by the computer, operating in a normal manner, or by the appa ratus, which may shift data selection between these two selection options so that the computer ceases se lection of data constituting one program and begins selecting data of another program. While data elements are being transferred with the computer, other elements of the memory means are available for examination and modification such that new programs, the content of which may depend on the results of prior program exe cution ran be loaded, executed, and examined without interrupting, delaying, halting, or otherwise disturbing the instruction flow ef the computer equipment.
