## Description
COSMETIC COMPOSITION The invention relates to cosmetic compositions in the form of solid sticks, in particular sticks comprising an alkanol, a diol and a soap. Attempts have been made to develop cosmetic sticks which do not feel waxy when applied to the skin and which deliver active ingredients to the skin, such as deodorant materials, via a vehicle which glides easily over the skin surface and which imparts a cooling sensation to the skin both during and after application. It has been proposed in EP Application 0024365 TheProctor Gamble Company to provide solid cosmetic sticks which include as an essential ingredient an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having from 2 to 3 carbon atoms and from 2 to 3 hydroxyl groups, examples of which are ethane diol and propane diol. Experience has shown, however, that when ethylene glycol is employed, it is extremely difficult to solidify the stick composition and to keep it solid at room temperature, which is the temperature of use.Furthermore, when propane diol is employed, a stick with a relatively wide melting range and a low mean melting point is obtained, which property presents difficulties when manufacturing stick compositions of this type, in that an unnecessarily long cooling time is required to solidify the sticks, and production is accordingly reduced. It has been discovered that when diols having 2 to 3 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol or propane diol are replaced at least partially by a diol, such as butane l,3 diol, having 4 carbon atoms, then stick compositions having a reduced waxy feel, compared with those containing either of these shorter chain diols exclusively, are obtained. Furthermore, sticks containing butane l,3 diol have a higher mean melting point and a narrower melting range which reduces processing time during their manufacture so increasing output, and aids in obtaining a stick which in use glides more easily over the skin in view of its non crystalline structure and uniform texture. It is with cosmetic sticks having these superior properties and with attendant processing advantages that this invention is concerned. Accordingly, the invention provides a cosmetic gel stick composition comprising from 2 to 60 by weight of an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, from 2 to 50 by weight of a diol containing 4 carbon atoms, and from 2 to 15 by weight of a soap, the composition having an average melting point of at least 500C. The cosmetic gel stick compositions of the invention comprise an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable alkanols include methanol, ethanol, propane l ol, propane 2 ol and butane l ol. The preferred alkanol is ethanol. The alkanol should form from 2 to 60 , preferably from 10 to 50 and most preferably from 20 to 50 by weight of the stick compositiont It is apparent that cosmetic gel stick compositions comprising less than 2 by weight of the alkanol tend to be too dry or brittle in use, so that they are unpleasant to apply to the skin. Conversely, cosmetic gel stick compositions comprising more than 60 by weight of the alkanol tend to be insufficiently rigid to maintain the structure of the stick in use. The cosmetic gel stick compositions of the invention also comprise a diol containing 4 carbon atoms. The preferred diol is butane 1, 3 diol, but butane 1, 4 diol and butane 2, 3 diol are also suitable. The diol should form from 2 to 50 , preferably from 10 to 50 by weight of the stick composition. It is apparent that cosmetic gel stick composition comprising less than 2 by weight of the diol tend, to be too dry or brittle in use so that they are unpleasant to apply to theskin. Conversaly, cosmeti gel stick composition comprising more than. 50 by weight of the diol tend to be insufficently rigid to maintain their structure in use. The cosmetic gel stick compositions of the invention also comprise a soap which functions as a gel forming agent. The soaps can be the alkali metal salts, such as the sodium or potassium salts, or the alkanolamine salts, such as the mono , di or triethanolamine salts of fatty acids containing from 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The fatty acid portion of the soap gel forming agents should be derived from essentially pure saturated or unsaturated higher fatty acids having 14 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable mixtures of such acids can be employed provided that such mixtures are free from significant proportions of other fatty acids of higher or lower chain length which substantially adversely affect the desired gel forming properties. Examples of suitable fatty acids for this purpose include myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, margaric and mixtures of such acids. Naturally occurring sources of such fatty acids include coconut oil, beef tallow, lanolin, fish oil, beeswax, palm oil, peanut oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, soya bean oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil, rosin acids and greases. Conventional fractionation and or hydrolysis techniques can be employed, if necessary, to obtain the requisite types of fatty acid from such materials. Especially preferred fatty acid soap gel forming agents include sodium stearate, sodium palmitate, potassium stearate, potassium palmitate and sodium myristate. The most preferred gel forming agent is sodium stearate. The soap can be provided as a preformed ingredient, or it can be formed during the manufacture of the cosmetic gel stick composition by reaction between one or more appropriate alkalis and one or more appropriate fatty acids as separate ingredients. The soap should form from 2 to 15 , preferably from 4 to 10 by weight of the stick composition. It is apparent that cosmetic gel stick compositions comprising less than 2 by weight of a soap tend to be insufficiently rigid to maintain their structure when in use. Conversely, cosmetic gel stick compositions comprising more than 15 by weight of the soap can exhibit an excessively greasy feel in use. The cosmetic gel stick compositions of the invention can also contain a variety of optional ingredients suitable for improving composition efficacy, stability and cosmetic appeal. Such optional ingredients include ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products, deodorant material, perfumes, dyes, pigments, colouring agents and the like. A particularly preferred optional ingredient of the compositions according to the invention is an ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation product which has the following formula H C2H40 a C3H6O bOR where R is either hydrogen or an alkyl group having from l to 20, preferably from 4 4 to 18 carbon atoms and a and b are each from 0 to 35, a b not exceeding 35. Examples of such products are a condensate of 14 moles of propylene oxide with 1 mole butyl alcohol sold by UnionCarbide under the name Fluid AP, and by British Petroleum under the name BREOX B35 a polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1200 a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight bf 420 a condensate o 20 moles df ethylene oxide and 5 moles of propylene oxide with 1 mole of cetyl alcohol a condensate of 15 moles of propylene oxide with one 1 mole of stearyl alcohol and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The preferred condensate is BREOXB35. The condensation product can be present in compositions of the invention at a concentration of up to 70 , preferably from 5 to 70 , most preferably from 10 to 70 by weight of the composition. A further preferred optional component of compositions according to the invention is a material which helps retard alcohol evaporation and which acts as an antisyneresis agent. Especially preferred materials of this type are cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcelluloses, such as hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose. When present, such alcohol evaporation retarding agents and antisyneresis agents can comprise up to 5 , preferably from 1 to 4 by weight of the composition. A further optional ingredient of the cosmetic stick composition is a conventional deodorant material. Suitable deodorants include bacteriostatic quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride, diisobutyl phenoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride,N alkylpyridinium chloride, N cetyl pyridinium bromide, sodium N lauroyl sarcosine, sodium N palmitoyl sarcosine, lauroyl sarcosine, N myristoyl glycine, potassium N lauroyl sarcosine and stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. When present, deodorants can generally comprise from 0.1 to 1 by weight of the composition. Other optional ingredients such as perfumes, dyes, pigments, colouring agents and the like, if present, can comprise up to 3 by weight of the stick composition of the invention. The cosmetic stick composition can also contain up to 20 by weight of water. Anhydrous i.e. substantially water free sticks can be rather hard, and sticks containing more than 20 by weight of water can be to soft to be acceptable in use. The cosmetic stick composition should also preferably have a melting span of no more than about 180C, preferably from 10 to 150C. The melting span is the difference between the temperature at which the stick composition melt begins to set and the temperature at which the stick composition is fully solidified, i.e. the melting range, when the composition in a molten state is cooled to the solid state. Cosmetic gel stick compositions having a melting span in excess of 180C will require an unduly lengthy cooling time during manufacture, with the consequence that the production rate will be relatively slow and the product consequently more expensive to produce than if a narrower melting span was applicable. The cosmetic stick composition of the invention should also have an average melting point of at least 500C and preferably from 50 to 650C. Ideally, the stick composition should have an average melting point of about 550C. The average melting point, also known as the drop point, is the average of the melting range and can be determined by the method designated British Standards BS 894 1956 and BP 1958 Appl.lVa II pages 823 to 826. Cosmetic gel stick compositions having an average melting point of less than 500C are likely to be to soft in use and may not retain their shape, particularly at high ambient temperatures. Also, cosmetic gel stick compositions having an average melting point of greater than 650C may be to hard, and may not slip easily over the skin surface when in use. The cosmetic gel stick compositions of the invention can be made by combining the ingredients in liquid form, heating as necessary, and pouring the liquid mixture into a mould having the desired shape and allowing it to set to form sticks. The cosmetic gel stick compositions can be used by the consumer by rubbing the stick on the area of the body where application is desired. In the case of a deodorant stick, the stick is rubbed, for example, in the axilla area to apply a deodorant agent contained in the stick. EXPERIMENT As stated earlier in this specification, it was found that diols other than those having 4 carbon atoms, such as the butane diols, were unsuitable for making cosmetic gel compositions. This was concluded from a comparative experiment in which several similar diols and other polyhydric alcohols were employed in the manufacture of otherwise similar stick compositions, the average melting point and melting span in each case being determined. The cosmetic sticks in this experiment had the following basic formulation w wEthanol 49Selected diol or polyhydric alcohol 37Sodium stearate 7Minor ingredients to 100 It was found that when hexane diol, glycerine, ethane diol and polyethane diol 400 also known as polyethylene glycol 400 were each tested in this way, the average melting point in each case was less than 400C. The sticks so obtained were too soft to be stored and used effectively at any but low ambient temperatures. When, however, butane diol was employed, the stick so obtained had a satisfactory average melting point of about 520C. The stick containing butane diol also had a narrow melting span of about 100C, which resulted in a shorter setting time and a higher product output with consequent reduction in unit cost, compared with that of sticks containing the other diols or polyhydric alcohols, each of which had melting spans in excess of 200C. EXAMPLES 1 TO 5 Given below are examples of compositions within the scope of the present invention.

In a comparative example which is not within the scope of the present invention, a stick was prepared containing 49 by weight ethanol and 20 by weight of BREOX B35, but without any butane 1,3 diol, the remaining ingredients including sodium stearate, propylene glycol and other ingredients being those stated in Examples I to V, and it was found that this particular formulation yielded a stick with an average melting point of 48 C. a melting range of from 40 to 550C and a melting span of 150C. This particular gel stick composition was to soft to be of any real value and was discarded.
