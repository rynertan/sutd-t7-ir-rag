# METHOD AND MATERIALS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES PROTECTIVE AGAINST MALARIAL INFECTION

## Abstract
Disclosed are vaccine compositions for use in develop ing protective immunity against infection by Plasmodium parasites. Soluble proteinaceous immunogens are isolated from the fluid culture medium of in vitro propagated plasmodial species parasites e.g., P. falciparum in mamma lian erythrocyte culture supernatant or from washes, includ ing hypotonic washes, of cultured erythrocytes parasitized by plasmodium. Immunogens so obtained have molecular weights in the range from about 35,000 daltons to about 85,000 daltons and from about 190,000 to about 210,000 daltons. Two principal immunogens of the invention have molecular weights of about 43,000 and about 54,000 daltons, respectively, while a third has a molecular weight of about 200,000. The water soluble immunogens are administered in a suitable carrier such as isotonic salt solution and in combination with a suitable adjuvant such as saponin or, preferably, aluminum hydroxide. Upon administration to vertebrate animals susceptible to plasmodial infection, vac cines according to the invention provoke immune responses protective against morbidity and mortality caused by, e.g., P. falciparum infection. Disclosed also are procedures for optimization of large scale plasmodial parasite growth in human erythrocyte cultures with accompanying develop ment of late erythrocytic stage parasites in large numbers and optimization of isolatable quantities of culture medium supernatant and wash derived immunogens.
