# Lift truck with light assembly for positioning load handling device.

## Abstract
A light assembly 28 is removably mounted, by a supporting member 54 , upon a lift truck load carriage 22 to provide a light source 32 positioned adjacent the bottom thereof and rearwardly of a load engaging fork 26 thereby forwardly and substantially horizontally to project light and a shadow of the fork 26 which aids the lift truck operator accurately to determine the fork elevation relative to a load stack, especially when operating in a high lift position. Upon lowering the load carriage 22 below a predetermined position the light assembly 28 is caught by and transferred to a fixed supporting member 60 on the lift truck mast 16, 17 so that it is protected from contact with the floor. It is then also tilted so that light is projected downwardly. Upon subsequent elevation of the carriage 22 above the predetermined position a reverse transfer of the light assembly takes place from the mast to the carriage.
