# PROCESS FOR THE SEPARATION AND ISOLATION OF THE AHF FRACTION, THE FIBRONECTIN FRACTION AND THE VON WILLEBRAND S RISTOCETIN COFACTOR FRACTION FROM BLOOD PLASMA

## Abstract
The present invention concerns a process for the separation and isolation of AHF, fibronectin and von Willebrand s ristocetin cofactor from blood plasma by adding a sulfated mucopolysaccharide to blood plasma to a concentration of from 0.05 to 0.4 mg ml of plasma, cooling the plasma to 0 C 15 C, cenrifuging the plasma to isolate a precipitate which forms and then removing the AHF rich supernatant liquid from the precipitate. The precipitate is washed in a slightly basic solution of dilute salts and then dissolved in a buffered solution of chaotrophic salts of the Hofmeister series having an ionic strength from 0.01 1. Fibronectin is separated by chromotgraphic means from the dissolved preicpitate which contains fibronectin and fibrinogen.
