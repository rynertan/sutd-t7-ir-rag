The catalyst is used in a catalytic amount sufficient to promote acylation of dechloromaytansinol with carboxylic acid III , e.g. about 0.001 to about 10 molar equivalents,preferably about 0.01 to about 1 equivalent, based on carboxylic acid III . The use of such a catalyst leads in many cases to remarkably improved yields of compound Ib The amount of carboxylic acid may also be reduced Thus, in many cases, the relative amount of III with respect to dechloromaytansinol may be reduced to about 1 to 10 molar equivalents. In connection with this reaction, if the carboxylic acid III , such as a carboxylic acid having an N acyl aaminoacyl group B , is isomeric, i.e. D and L isomers, such isomers of III may be employed either independently or as an optional mixture When an optically active acyl group is introduced into the 3 hydroxyl group of dechloromaytansinol, the use of the corresponding optical form of carboxylic acid III proves advantageous in somme There also are cases in which even the use of an optically active carboxylic acid III gives rise to a mixture of D and L isomers of compound Ib . The acylation process utilizing a reactive derivative of carboxDrlic acid III with respect to its carboxyl function may for example be a process which comprises us .ng a derivative having a functional group capable of acylat the 7 position of dechloromaytansinol such as the acid anhydride of carboxylic acid III , The solvent and catalyst for use in this acylation reaction may be the same as those mentioned hereinbefore in connection with acylation in the presence of a carbodiimide The reaction temperature may usually range from about 200C to about 100 C and preferably about 200C to about 40 C. The reaction may be hastened by heating the reaction system to a still higher temperature. The compound Ib thus produced can be isolated by subjecting the reaction mixture to a conventional procedure such as concentration, solvent extraction, chromatography, recrystallization, etc. When compound, Ib is produced as a mixture of isomers e.g. D and L isomers , the isomers can be separated from each other generally by a conventional procedure, e.g. silica gel column chromatography. The dechloromaytansinoid compound I according to this invention includes such individual isomers and all mixtures of the isomers. The dechloromaytansinoid compound I , especially Ib according to this invention has strong anti mitotic activity and antitumor activity, with comparatively low toxicity and therefore can be orally or parenterally administered to tumor bearing warm blooded animals e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, human being for prolongation of their survival time The compound I is normally administered in the form of a suitable pharmaceutical preparation e.g. injectable preparation as formulated with a conventional carrier, diluent or the like When compound I is administered in the form of an injectable preparation, it may be given subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, for instance. The dosage of compound I varies with the kind, s mptom, administration route, etc. but, for example, in case of intravenous administration for prolonging life span of the animal suffering from leukemia or melanoma, it may be decided from the range of about 1 to 1000 Ag kg body weight, preferably about 10 to 500 Wg kg body weight, especially about 25 to 400 g kg body weight, per dose Such an injectable solution can be prepared by the established pharmaceutical procedure, e.g. by dissolving about 50 pg to 3 mg of I in about 0.5 m of alcohol e.g. ethanol and making up the solution with physiological saline to obtain a total of 10 mE, When only a small dose is indicated, the above solution may be further diluted with physiological saline The dechloromaytansinoid compound I is useful also in that is displays antifungal and antiprotozoal activities, Thus, for example, the compound I is useful for treatingTetrahymens pyriformis W.When I is used as an antifungal order antiprotozoal agent, it proves advantageous in testing a sample of soil, active sludge or animal body fluid for its bacterial flora Thus, in such applications as the isolation of useful bacteria from soil samples and an assay of the activity of bacteria, to the exclusion of protozoa and fungi, in the operation and analysis of active sludge systems for waste water treatment, the compound I specifically allows the bacteria to grow without permitting grovAh of fungi and protozoa which may also be present in the specimens A typical such procedure may comprise adding a test specimen to a liquid or solid medium, then adding 0.1 ml of about 10 to 100 g ml of compound I in water with 1 methanol added and incubating the mixture The dechloromaytansinoid compound I , at the dose level of 0.02 me as a 1 mg mE aqueous solution, inhibits growth of the causative microorganisms of stem rot, Helminthhosporium leaf spot and sheath blight in rice plants and, therefore, can be used in the control of such plant diseases by spraying rice plants with a solution of compound I in 1 methanolwater, the concentration of which may range from about 0.5 to 5 g ml The starting compound II employed in the method of this invention may be one of the known compounds such as maytansines and ansamitocins, and may also be produced by acylating maytansinol with said carboxylic acid of formuls III or said reactive derivative of III with respect to its carboxyl function. The acylation process may be similar to that described hereinbefore in connection with the acylation of dechloromaytansinol Maytansinol, the starting compound II for the production of the compounds according to this invention, is a known compound and a plant principle Xupchan et al., J.Anger Chem Soc, 97, 5294 1975 . It can also be produced by reductive cleavage of maytancine and its analogs. Naytansinol can also be produced advantageously by growing an Antibiotic C 15003 producing strain of the genus Nocardia FERM P No.3992, IFO 13726, ATCC 31281 in a culture medium to obtain ansamitocin of formula V EMI21.1 wherein R8 is acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, n butyryl or isovaleryl, and subjecting the same V to reductive cleavage with a metal hydride such as LiAlH4 CE. Higashide et al, Nature, vol. 270, 721 1977 U1S Patent No. 4,162,940 Ser, No 811, 448 The starting compound III for the production of compounds of this invention is generally a carboxylic acid which is known per se or a carboxylic acid produced by a process analogous to the known process for the production of such known carboxylic acids The following is a partial list of the available literature on such known reduction methods J.
