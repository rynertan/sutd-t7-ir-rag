# Power transformer for converter stations in high voltage direct current installations.

## Abstract
Power transformer for converter stations in high voltage direct current installations with insulated electrodes 10 whereby the term electrodes refers to metallic surfaces and bodies in the transformer. According to the invention the electrodes are covered by an insulating lining 12 consisting of at least three layers of a tape or sheet formed wrapping material 13 having a fibrous and porous structure. The individual layers have through going pores or openings with an opening area of 0.2 10 mmÂ² and with a total pore surface of 20 80 of the total surface of the wrapping material. The effect of this insulation is that ions generated by the high d.c. electric field strength outside the electrodes on their approaching the electrodes do not sense the porous tape insulation as any noticeable obstacle, while at the same time the insulating layer is sufficiently dense to increase the dielectric breakdown voltage so as to withstand in the case of electric surge voltages.
