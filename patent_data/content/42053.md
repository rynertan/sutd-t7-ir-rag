# Method and apparatus for cleaning target surfaces by ion milling.

## Abstract
A method for cleaning uneven surfaces, particularly semiconductor 36 surfaces having channels, via holes or stepped surface topography. An electron beam device which generates an ion beam is provided. The target having an uneven surface topography is oriented in the path of the ion beam at a particular angle with reference to the center line of the ion beam. While in the particular orienta tion with respect to the center line, the target is rotated about an axis normal to the plane of the target surface.
