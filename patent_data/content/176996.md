## Description
The present invention relates to integrated semiconductor devices and in particular to semiconductor sensors of the class as described in EP A 0 076 935. Such flow sensors provide high sensitivity flow sensing, particularly at low flow rates and include the features as listed in the pre characterizing portion of claim 1. The depression provides substantial physical and thermal isolation between the transducer element and the semiconductor body. EP A 0 021 291 shows a flow meter with the medium flowing across two electrical resistors, whereat the current increase required for maintaining a predetermined temperature difference between those resistors is used as measure of the flow rate. Those resistors together with two further resistors constitute a bridge circuit. The first mentioned measuring resistor and reference resistor are thin film resistors supported by a thin substrate. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 21, No. 8, Jan. 1979 describes on page 3227 a mass flow meter consisting of a planar resistor structure with three rectangular meander resistors embedded into a silicon strip. The present invention discloses in claim 1 an improved semiconductor device and in claim 13 a method for fabricating such semiconductor device. Preferred embodiments and improvements of the invention are described in the subclaims. The semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor body with a first surface having a predetermined orientation with respect to a crystalline structure in the semiconductor body. The semiconductor body has a depression formed into the first surface of the body. A layer of thin film material covers at least a portion of the first surface. Diaphragm apparatus comprising the layer of thin film material and further comprising a static electric element forms a slotted diaphragm substantially covering the depression. The slotted diaphragm comprises at least one slot sized and oriented so that, in the fabrication of the device, an anisotropic etch placed on the slot will undercut the diaphragm and form the depression. The static electric element is substantially supported by the diaphragm and therefore is substantially thermally and physically isolated from the semiconductor body. The present invention further describes a method of fabricating a slotted diaphragm semiconductor device comprising a slotted diaphragm of thin film material substantially covering a depression etched into a first surface of a semiconductor body. The method comprises the steps of providing a semiconductor body with a first surface having a predetermined orientation with respect to a crystalline structure in the semiconductor body. The method further comprises applying a layer of thin film material of which thediaphragm is comprised onto the first surface and exposing an area of the first surface through a slot in the layer of the thin film material. The slot is sized and oriented so that an anisotropic etch placed on the exposed surface area will undercut the diaphragm and form the depression. The method also comprises applying the anisotropic etch to the exposed surface area to undercut the diaphragm and create the depression. Figures 1 3 illustrate alternate preferred embodiments of flow sensors constructed in accordance with the present invention. Figure 4 illustrates circuitry for operating the disclosed flow sensor. Structures in accordance with the present invention have many applications. The present invention is disclosed using an example of alternate preferred embodiments of a flow sensor compatible with the present invention. The present invention, however, is not limited to flow sensors. Structures in accordance with the present invention typically comprise static electric, thermal to electric, and or electric to thermal elements, supported by a slotted diaphragm substantially covering a depression in a semiconductor body. The present invention comprises an integrated semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor body 20 with a first surface 36 having a predetermined orientation with respect to a crystalline structure in the semiconductor body. Semiconductor body 20 has a depression 30 formed into first surface 36 of the body. The present invention further comprises a layer 29 of thin film material covering at least a portion of first surface 36. The present invention further comprises diaphragm means 32 comprising layer 29 of thin film material and further comprising a static electric, thermal to electric, or electric to thermal element such as elements 22, 24 and 26 further discussed below. Diaphragm means 32 forms a slotted diaphragm 32 substantially covering depression 30. Slotted diaphragm 32 comprises a slot 82 sized and oriented so that, in the fabrication of the device, an anisotropic etch placed on slot 82 will undercut diaphragm 32 and form depression 30. The static electric, thermal to electric, or electric to thermal element is substantially supported by diaphragm 32 and, therefore, is substantially thermally and physically isolated from semiconductor body 20. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises a semiconductor body 20 having a depression 30 formed into a first surface 36 of body 20, semiconductor body 20 comprising 100 silicon and having a 100 plane and a 110 direction, first surface 36 of semiconductor body 20 being substantially parallel to the 100 plane. The preferred embodiment of the present invention further comprises a layer 29 of thin film material covering at least a portion of first surface 36. The preferred embodiment further comprises diaphragm means 32 comprising layer 29 of thin film material and further comprising a static electric, thermal to electric, or electric to thermal element such as 22, 24 or 26 as further discussed below. Diaphragm means 32 comprises a slotted diaphragm 32 substantially covering depression 30, the slotted diaphragm comprising slot 82 oriented at an angle 112 of substantially 45 degrees to the 110 direction and extending across depression 30 at the approximate center of the depression. The static electric, thermal to electric, or electric to thermal element is substantially supported by diaphragm 32 and, therefore is substantially thermally and physically isolated from semiconductor body 20. As will be further discussed below, the present invention is adaptable to being configured as a flow sensor. In such configurations, a thin film heater 26 is supported over depression 30 by diaphragm 32. In the preferred embodiment, approximately half of heater 26 is located on each side of slot 82. The preferred embodiment of the present flow sensor further comprises a pair of thin film heat sensors 22 and 24 supported by diaphragm 32. In the preferred embodiment, the thin film heat sensors 22 and 24 are disposed on opposite sides of heater 26. The present invention further comprises a method of fabricating a slotted diaphragm semiconductor device comprising a slotted diaphragm 32 of thin film material 29 substantially covering a depression 30 etched into a first surface 36 of a semiconductor body 20. The method comprises the steps of providing a semiconductor body 20 with a first surface 36 having a predetermined orientation with respect to a crystalline structure in the semiconductor body. The method further comprises applying a layer 29 of thin film material of which diaphragm 32 is comprised onto first surface 36. An area of first surface 36 is exposed through a slot 82 in layer 29 of the thin film material. Slot 82 is sized and oriented so that an anisotropic etch placed on the exposed surface area will undercut diaphragm 32 and form depression 30. The method further comprises applying the anisotropic etch to the exposed surface area to undercut diaphragm 32 and create depression 30. A preferred method of practicing the present invention comprises providing a semiconductor body 20 comprising 100 silicon and having a 100 plane and a 110 direction, first surface 36 of the semiconductor being substantially parallel to the 100 plane. The preferred method further comprises providing a layer of thin film material of which diaphragm 32 is comprised onto first surface 36. An area of first surface 36 is exposed through a slot 82 in the layer of thin film material. Slot 82 is oriented at substantially 45 degrees to the 110 direction. The slot has a length which determines the maximum width of depression 30 as measured along the slot oriented at substantially 45 degrees to the 110 direction. An anisotropic etch is applied to the exposed surface area to undercut diaphragm 32 and create depression 30. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, depression 30 is bounded at first surface 36 by a substantially square configuration comprising four substantially perpendicular boundary edges 111 and 113, each of the four substantially perpendicular boundary edges being substantially in line with or substantially perpendicular to the 110 direction. In this embodiment, slotted diaphragm 32 comprises slot means comprising first and second slots 82A and 82B located on a line 83 oriented at an angle 112 of substantially 45 degrees to the 110 direction. Each of first and second slots 82A and 82B comprise a first end 200A and 200B respectively, first and second slots 200A and 200B being located at a maximum width of depression 30 as measured along line 83. Each of the first and second slots 82A and 82B have a second end 202A and 202B respectively, ends 202A and 202B being located so that each of the first and second slots 82A and 82B extend only a portion of the distance across the maximum width of depression 30 as measured along line 83. The further preferred embodiment further comprises third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F oriented substantially in line with or substantially perpendicular to the 110 direction, there being one of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots located at the substantial center of each of the four boundary edges 111 and 113. Each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F have a length sufficient to permit undercutting of diaphragm 32 when isotropic etch is placed on each of the six slots as is further explained below. When configured as a flow sensor, the further preferred embodiment comprises a thin film heater 26 supported over depression 30 by diaphragm 32. Approximately half of heater 26 is located on each side of line 83. In that embodiment, a pair of thin film heat sensors 22 and 24 are supported by diaphragm 32, thin film heat sensors 22 and 24 being disposed on opposite sides of heater 26. The method of fabricating the further preferred embodiment comprises exposing first and second areas of first surface 36 through first and second slots 82A and 82B in layer 29 of the thin film material. First and second slots 82A and 82B are located on a line 83 oriented at substantially 45 degrees to the 110 direction. Each of the first and second slots 82A and 82B comprise a first end 200A and 200B respectively located at a maximum width of depression 30 as measured along line 83. Each of the first and second slots 82A and 82B have a second end 200A and 200B respectively located so that each of the first and second slots extends only a portion of the distance across the maximum width of the depression as measured along line 83. Third, fourth, fifth and sixth areas of first surface 36 are exposed through third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F in thin film layer 29. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F are oriented substantially in line or substantially perpendicular to the 110 direction, there being one of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F located at the substantial center of each of the four boundary edges 111 and 113. Each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth slots have a length sufficient to permit undercutting of diaphragm 32 when an anisotropic etch is placed on each of the six slots. The anisotropic etch is applied to the exposed surface areas to undercut diaphragm 32 and create depression 30. Body 20 is preferrably a semiconductor body and preferrably silicon, chosen because of its adaptability to precision etching techniques and ease of electronic chip producibility. The preferred embodiment of a flow sensor in accordance with the present invention preferrably includes two identical temperature sensing resistor grids 22 and 24 acting as thin film heat sensors and further includes a centrally located heater resistor grid 26 acting as a thin film heater. Sensors 22 and 24 and heater 26 are preferrably fabricated of nickel iron, herein sometimes referred to as permalloy, having a preferred composition of 80 percent nickel and 20 percent iron. The sensor and heater grids are typically encapsulated in a thin film of dielectric, typically comprising layers 28 and 29 and preferrably silicon nitride to form thin film diaphragms 32. The preferred embodiment of devices fabricated in accordance with the present invention further comprise an accurately defined air space 30 between diaphragm 32 and semiconductor body 20. Air space 30 effectively results in an area space on each side of diaphragm 32. Effectively placing an air space on each side of diaphragm 32 is achieved by fabricating the structure on silicon surface 36, and by subsequently etching an accurately defined air space 30 into silicon body 20 beneath diaphragm 32. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, slot 82 cut through nitride layer 29 to expose an area of first surface 36 can be quite narrow, 5 microns for example. The anisotropic etch removes the silicon in the form of a square depression 30 bounded by substantially perpendicular boundary edges 111 and 113, boundary edges 111 illustrated being substantially in line with the 110 direction and boundary edges 113 as illustrated being substantially perpendicular to the 110 direction. The width of slot 82 can be quite narrow, 5 microns for example, although a wider slot will provide more rapid diffusive removal of etch product and thus reduce the time required to complete depression 30. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1A, the longer slot 82 illustrated in Figure 1 is divided into two shorter slots 82A and 82B with a broad section of silicon nitride supporting film layers 28 and 29 connecting the right and left sides of diaphragm 32. This connection furher strengthens the silicon nitride supporting film and further prevents penetration of airflow under the more vulnerable central part of diaphragm 32. Accordingly, the embodiment of Figure 1A is stronger for high velocity flow applications than the embodiment of Figure 1. However, slots 82A and 82B by themselves do not permit the anisotropic etch formation of the entire desired diaphragm 32 because the corresponding etch pits that would be created from slots 82A and 82B are limited to the vicinity of these slots as shown by dashed lines 204A and 204B respectively in Figure 1B. Thus, it is necessary to form slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F approximately centrally located on boarder edges 111 and 113 and having a sufficient length so that the depressions formed through slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F slightly overlap the local depressions formed through slots 82A and 82B. After the depressions adjacent to slots 82A and 82B are formed these local depressions being defined by dashed lines 204A and 204B respectively , a second stage of etching begins, and the depression bounded previously by dashed line 204A is enlarged to a larger depression bounded by dashed line 206A similarly, the depression previously bounded by dashed line 204B is enlarged to a larger depression now bounded by dashed line 206B and overlapping the depression bounded by line 206A. The final depression dimensions are formed in a third and last stage of etching where regions 208 are etched out, thus resulting in a square depression having the same dimensions as in Figure 1. Slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F can be even narrower than slots 82A and 82B, 3 microns for example, because the diffusive access of the anisotropic etch to the space beneath the diaphragm can be adequately provided by slots 82A and 82B, and the additional access provided by slots 82C, 82D, 82E and 82F only speed up the etching process. The operation of the present sensor in sensing air flow can be described with reference to Figure 1. Heater resistor grid 26 operates at a preferred constant average temperature difference of 100 200 degrees centigrade elevated above the temperature of silicon chip 20 which temperature is not appreciably different from the ambient air stream temperature. In the preferred embodiment illustrated, sensor grids 22 and 24 are precisely symmetrically located with respect to heater grid 26 so that at zero airflow they have identical temperatures and have no differences between their resistances. Consequently, a small probe current, 0.1 1.0 milli amperes preferred, through both sensor resistances 22 and 24 will develop no voltage difference at zero airflow velocity. With airflow present, upstream sensor 22 will be cooled by the transportation of heat away from sensor 22 toward heater resistor grid 26, whereas downstream sensor 24 will be heated by a transportation of heat toward the sensor from heat resistor grid 26. Consequently, a resistance difference between sensor resistances 22 and 24 will be present with a corresponding difference in voltage drop which is a measure of the air flow. Typical unamplified voltage differences can be as high as 0.1 volt at a 1500 feet minute flow velocity. In the preferred operation of the present sensor, sensors 22 and 24 are operated with constant current such that temperature field changes can be sensed under flow conditions as previously described. Other operating arrangements are also possible. Because of the exceedingly small thermal mass of the heater and sensor element structure and the thermal insulation provided by the thin silicon nitride connecting means to the supporting silicon body, and because of the surrounding air space, response time of the present sensor is very short, with response time constants of 0.005 seconds having been measured. Consequently, sensor elements 22 and 24 can respond very rapidly to air flow changes. In the preferred embodiment of the present sensor, ambient temperature is monitored by a reference resistor 38 which is heat sunk onto semiconductor body 20. Resistor 38 may be a permalloy grid formed substantially like grids 22, 24 and 26 and is typically encapsulated in dielectric layers 28 and 29 and mounted on surface 36. The typical 0.8 micron total thickness of dielectric layers 28 and 29 is very thin and, accordingly, permits relatively good heat conduction and transfer perpendicular to the layers to and from resistive grids 22, 24, 26 and 38. Thus, reference resistor 38, being attached by the encapsulating dielectric directly to surface 36 of semiconductor body 20, readily monitors the temperature of the semiconductor body, which stays within 0.5 degrees centigrade of ambient temperature even with resistor grid 26 elevated to 200 degrees centigrade above ambient. Accordingly, heat sunk reference resistor 38 may be used to monitor ambient air flow temperature by monitoring a temperature that is very close to that of semiconductor body 20, which in turn is very close to ambient temperature. As previously indicated in the preferred operation of the present sensor, heater 26 is operated at a constant temperature above ambient temperature, sensors 22 and 24 being operated at constant current, and the changing temperatures of sensors 22 and 24 are sensed as changes in resistance. Circuits for accomplishing these functions are illustrated in Figure 4. The smaller circuit controls the temperature of heater 26 while the larger circuit provides an output voltage that is proportional to the resistance difference between heat sensing resistors 22 and 24. The heater control circuit illustrated in Figure 4, upper portion, uses a wheatstone bridge 46 to maintain heater 26 at a constant temperature rise above ambient as sensed by heat sunk reference resistor 38. Wheatstone bridge 46 is shown comprising heater resistor 26 and a resistor 40 in its first leg and a resistor 42, heat sunk resistor 38 and a resistor 44 in its second leg. An error integrator comprising amplifier 50 keeps bridge 46 balanced by varying the potential across it and thus the power dissipated in heater 26. The circuity shown in Fig. 4, lower portion, which monitors the resistance difference between downstream sensor 24 and upstream sensor 22 includes a constant current source 52 comprising an amplifier 72 and a differential amplifier 54 comprising amplifier 68 and 70. The constant current source drives a wheatstone bridge comprising two high impedance resistors 56 and 58 in one leg and the two sensing resistors 22 and 24 with a nulling potentiometer 60 in the other leg. The gain of differential amplifier 54 is adjusted by potentiometer 62. Output 64 provides a voltage that is proportional to the resistance difference between the two sensing resistors 22 and 24. Amplifiers 50, 66 and 72 may each comprise one fourth of an LM324. Amplifiers 68 and 70 may each comprise one half of an OP 10. Upstream sensor resistor 22 preferrably has an inner edge 76 in close proximity 5 to 10 microns, for example to the near edge 78 of heater resistor grid 26. At such a separation from near edge 78 of heater resistor grid 26, the zero flow air temperature near heater resistor edge 78 is close to that of edge 78. In a typical embodiment, where sensors 22 and 24 have a width of approximately 100 microns, outer edge 80 of sensor resistor grid 22 is located approximately 100 microns from near edge 78 of heater resistor grid 26. At the 100 micron separation, the zero airflow temperature is closer to that of the ambient air stream and to that of silicon chip 20 than it is to the temperature of heater resistor 26. Therefore, outer edge 80 of sensor resistor grid 22 is easily cooled to near the limiting temperature of silicon chip 20 by low velocity airflow, whereas the inner regions of sensor resistor grid 22 near edge 76 are more tightly coupled thermally to heater resistor 26 and respond more readily to the higher airflow velocity before the limiting temperature of the ambient airstream is approached. Accordingly, the composite effect of the temperature change from each resistor grid line lines spaced over the approximately 5 100 micron distance from heater edge 76 for an increment of airflow is to keep the corresponding increment on the upstream resistor temperature response curve more nearly constant over a broad airflow range. As shown in Figure 1, area 82 and areas 82A 82F are cut in the silicon nitride to facilitate etching as further described below. Overall geometry, including that of leads 92, is preferably made symmetrically to insure symmetrical heat conduction properties. Leads 92 connect to pad areas 90 for electrically connecting sensor elements 22, 24, 26, and 38 with circuitry 13 as previously discussed. Elements 22 and 24 have a preferred resistance in one example of 1200 ohms and element 26 has a preferred resistance in that example of 520 ohms. In this embodiment, sensors 22 and 24 have a width of approximately 100 microns and a length of approximately 175 microns. As previously indicated, in this example the proximal edges of sensors 22 and 24 are in close proximity e.g., 5 10 microns away from heater 26. That is, edge 76 of sensor 22 is 5 10 microns away from edge 78 of heater 26, and edge 84 of sensor 24 is 5 10 microns away from edge 86 of heater 26. As with other dimensions listed in the present application, the above dimensions are preferred dimensions which have been used in actual devices and are not deemed to be limiting, since these parameters could be substantially varied depending upon application. The preferred process of fabricating the present sensor comprises providing a 100 silicon wafer 20 having a surface 36 which receives a layer 29 of silicon nitride. Layer 29 is typically 4000 angstroms thick and is typically deposited by standard sputtering techniques in a low pressure gas discharge. Next, a uniform layer of permalloy, typically 80 nickel and 20 iron and 800 angstroms thick, is deposited on the silicon nitride by sputtering. Using a suitable photo mask, a photoresist and a suitable etchant, permalloy elements such as 22, 24, 26 and 38 are delineated. A second layer 28 of silicon nitride, typically 4000 angstroms thick, is then sputter deposited to provide complete coverage of the permalloy configuration and thus protect the resistive element from oxidation. Openings such as 82 and 82A 82F are then etched through the nitride to the 100 silicon surface in order to delineate slotted diaphragm 32. The relative sizes of openings such as 82 and 82A 82F are largely a matter of design choice. Anisotropic etchant that does not appreciably attack the silicon nitride is used to etch out the silicon in a controlled manner from beneath diaphragm 32 KOH plus Isopropyl alcohol is a suitable etchant . The sides of the etched depression such as 30 are bounded by 111 and other crystal surfaces that are resistive to the etchant. The depression bottom, a 100 surface which is much less resistant to the etchant, is located at a specified distance e.g., 125 microns from the members, typically by adjusting the duration of the etch. A doped silicon etch stop e.g., a boron doped layer may also be used to control the depth of the depression, although such stops are not typically necessary when fabricating the present sensor. By adjusting the duration of the etch, the depth of depressions such as 30 can be controlled to a precision of about three microns or to about two percent. This precision results in a precise reproducibility of the thermal conductance of the air space surrounding diaphragm 32 and a correspondingly precise reproducibility of air flow response. Figure 3 shows a region 116 for integration of circuitry, for example, portions of the circuitry illustrated in Figure 6. For the embodiments shown, diaphragm 32 is typically 0.8 1.2 microns thick. Typical permalloy elements such as elements 22, 24, 26 and 38 have a thickness of approximately 800 angstroms typically in the range of approximately 800 angstroms to approximately 1600 angstroms with a preferred composition of 80 nickel and 20 iron and a resistance value within the range of approximately 200 ohms to approximately 2000 ohms at room temperature, e.g., at approximtely 20 25 degrees centigrade at permalloy element temperatures up to approximately 400 degrees centigrade resistance values increase by a factor of up to approximately 3 . Line widths within permalloy grids may be approximately 5 microns with a 5 micron spacing. Depressions such as 30 typically have a .005 inch 125 micron depth spacing between members such as 32 and 34 and the semiconductor body such as 20, but the spacing can easily vary in the range of approximately .001 inch to approximately .010 inch. A typical thickness of the semiconductor body or substrate such as 20 is .008 inch. As previously indicated, dimensions provided are illustrative only and are not to be taken as limitations. Typical operating temperatures of heater elements such as 26 are in the range of approximately 100 200 degrees centigrade with approximately 160 degrees centigrade above ambient being the preferred operating temperature. Using the preferred permalloy element, this can be accomplished with only a few milliwatts of input power. A heater resistance element having a 200 1000 ohm preferred resistance at 25 degrees centigrade provides the desired power dissipation to achieve the preferred operating temperature at a convenient voltage of a few volts and a convenient current of, for example, 2 to 5 milliamperes.
