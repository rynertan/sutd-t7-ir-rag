## Description
METHOD FOR REDUCTION OF SEWAGE SLUDGE FROM SEWAGE CLARIFICATION PLANTSBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for reducing sewage sludge from sewage clarification plants by converting at least a part of the organic mass of the sewage sludge into a biodegradable form by treatment of the sludge with an acid at an elevated temperature. The biological treatment of sewage in which bacteria degrade the organic mass is a commonly employed method for the treatment of sewage. In such methods, the mass of bacteria propagates and increases the amount of the produced sewage sludge, i.e. the sludge from the presettling tank, the activated sludge, the excess sludge or the digested sludge. The disposal of the sludge mass however is often a problem.. Therefore, in past years, skilled artisans searched intensively for better and more effective ways to reduce the sludge mass, i.e. dewatering the sludge and dissolving the cell walls of the bacteria. Most of the proposed solutions to the problem employed mechanical methods e.g. pressing, filtration, flocculation or centrifuging, to dewater the sewage mass. Chemical auxiliary means were also used in such methods. German Patent No. 30 15 243 describes a process for dewatering sludge. According to this process, the sludge is adjusted to a pH value of 0.9 to 1.5 prior to dewatering with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid with the simultaneous addition of iron ions. The ventilation that followed this process was carried out at a temperature below 40 C. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 81 60699 it was suggested to subject the sludge to an alkaline or acidic treatment in order to crack the cell membranes of the bacteria in the sludge. According to this process the proteins were extracted and precipitated and used as a filter to obtain dehydrogenated dewatered sludge. In these prior processes, the sludge was concentrated and consequently some problems, e.g.transportation, odor, and storage was reduced but the organic portion of the sludge still remained unchanged. A more effective process is therefore still needed to chemically decompose the organic portion of sludge or to convert the sludge into a biologically degradable form. The further developed Baber Colman Wetox process see CA 86 26 194489 k and the therein published literature relates to wet oxidation of sludge in an acidic medium. The process is carried out in 0.3 weight percent sulphuric acid, based on the total weight of the sludge, at a temperature of 2320C and at a pressure of 600 psi 41 bar . On account of the high temperature and pressure, a large amount of energy is consumed. In addition, expensive equipment, e.g. made of tantalum, is needed at these severe reaction conditions. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 76 57955 it is proposed to tread excess sludge with a mineral acid, to neutralize the hydrolysate and to subject it to an activated sludge treatment. According to the example, 50 lit. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to 200 lit. of sludge. The mixture is heated for a period of 5 hours. With the acid treatment, the solids content of the sludge is reduced to 22 percent of the original amount. The remaining 78 percent of the organic portion of the solid content is dissolved during this process. The chemical oxygen demand COD of the solution is 6066 ppm. Subsequently the sludge is neutralized, diluted in a 15,000 lit. container and additional activated sludge is added. After ventilation for a period of 24 hours the sludge had settled. TheCOD of the remaining solution was 58 ppm. A disadvantage of this process is the large amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid used from which a proton and chloride ion concentration of 2.4 mol lit. is formed. After neutralization, the sludge contains a high concentration of salt which is destructive to the bacteria in the activated sludge. Accordingly, the sludge is greatly diluted and subsequently subjected to decomposition by activated sludge bacteria. If the great amount of dilution is taken into consideration, only 40 to 60 percent of the amount of the organic mass which is dissolved by the acid treatment, measured by COD, is decomposed by the subsequent treatment with bacteria in the activated sludge. This is another substantial disadvantage of the process.Summary of The Invention An object of the present invention is to develop a new process for reducing the organic mass of sewage sludge without the disadvantages of the known processes. Surprisingly, it was found that this aim can be reached in a process for reducing sewage sludge from sewage clarification plants by converting at least a part of the organic mass of the sewage sludge into a biodegradable form by treatment of the sludge with an acid at an elevated temperature which is characterized in that the pH value of the sludge is reduced to 0 to 2 and the sludge is treated at a temperature of from 80 to 2000C at an elevated pressure. In the process of the present invention significantly lower acid concentrations are necessary than in the described Japanese process. At optimum process conditions up to 85 weight percent of the organic solids content of the sludge can be dissolved in the process of the present invention. The dissolved organic parts are then biologically easily degradable. Up to 85 weight percent of these dissolved parts can be degraded aerobically or anaerobically by bacteria.Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments In the process of the present invention, sewage sludge from sewage clarification plants is treated with acid at an elevated temperature. The sewage sludge can originate from the treatment or purification of industrial wastewater or raw sewage.Normally the sewage sludge contains a dry substance contents of from 0.2 to 2 weight percent. However, it is not critical that the content be within the range of from 0.2 to 2 weight percent, a larger amount of dry substance can be contained in the sludge. If desired, for example to save energy and chemicals, the sludge can be additionally dehydrated or dephlegmated before carrying out the process of the invention e g to a dry substance contents of up to 9, preferably from 4 to 6 weight percent. This additional dephlegmation can be carried out by any suitable process, e.g. in a centrifuge or a sieve drum decanter. In general, any inorganic acid can be used, if strong enough, to regulate the pH value of the sludge to the desired value. The anions of the acid should however be physiologically compatible. Mineral acids, like phosphoric acid, nitrid acid, hydrochloric acid and or sulphuric acid, can be used. These acids can be used in technical quality and are therefore inexpensive. For acidification, from 20 to 30 weight percent hydrochloric acid and or from 50 to 98, preferably from 70 to 98 weight percent sulphuric acid are effective. The pH value of the sludge is adjusted to from about 0 to about 2, preferably from about 0 to about 1.5, most preferably from about 0 to about 1.The pH value is generally below 2 and above 0. Said pE values can be provided by addition of such an amount of acid, preferably a strong acid, that the added hydronium ion concentration is about 0.01 mol to about 1.5 mol, preferably about 0.03 mol to about 1.5 mol, most preferably about 0.1 mol to about 1 mol, based on the total liters of sludge and added acid. For example, 5 weight percent concentrated sulfuric acid can be added, based on the total weight of the sludge. A pH value above 2 is not advantageous because the degradability of the dissolved organic substances by bacteria decreases. Before, at the same time, or after, adding the acid, the sludge is heated to a temperature of from 800C, preferably 1300C, most preferably from 1500C, up to 2000C, preferably up to 1800C, most preferably up to 16O0C. The heating can take place with any known heating means, e.g. electric heating or steam. The thermal acid treatment is carried out at an elevated pressure. The pressure depends among other things on the temperature. Generally the pressure is in a range of from 2 bar, preferably from 4 bar, up to 10 bar, preferably up to 8 bar, most preferably up to 6 bar. The duration of the thermal acid treatment depends among other things on the chosen temperature of the sludge mass and on the desired dissolution rate of sludge. The usual duration is from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The sludge can be treated for longer periods of time. However, a longer treatment does not provide any substantial advantages. In particular, a treatment duration of from 1 to 2.5 hours, preferably from 2 to 2.5 hours, has proved to be most effective. An essential improvement of the present invention is that with a considerably lower amount of acid and a treatment of shorter duration the same percentage of dissolution of the organic sludge parts can be reached as in the process according to JapanesePatent Publication No. 76 57955. With the thermal acid treatment at least a part of the organic mass is converted into a biodegradable form. If desired, a part of the dissolved organic mass can also be chemically degraded with an oxidant. The oxidant, e.g. oxygen in diluted or undiluted form, hydrogen peroxide, peroxy disulphate or other known oxidants, can be added to the sludge. The amount of the oxidants can vary greatly but is generally an amount sufficient to complete the oxidation and is readily determined by persons skilled in the art. The thermal acid treatment can be carried out in any suitable reactor. However, it is recommended to use non corrosive materials. Preferred are reactors that are lined with tantalum, teflon, glass, enamel, ceramic material or other similar non corrosive materials. Most preferred are reactors made of lined steel tube or an enamelled agitator vessel. When the thermal acid treatment is terminated at least a part, preferably from, 70 to 90 weight percent, most preferably from 75 to 85 weight percent, of the original organic solid particles of the sludge is dissolved. The reaction mixture can afterwards be cooled and neutralized. Any suitable coolant can be used. Neutralization dan be carried out before, during, or after cooling, preferablywafter cooling.Any base can be used, if the cations are physiologically compatible. Basic sewage water having a pH of greater than 7 can also be used for neutralization.Preferred are strong inorganic bases such as alkali hydroxides. Preferred are concentrated alkaline solutions or caustic cell solutions solutions which originate from chlor alkali cells having a concentration of about 10 weight percent . In particular sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solutions in a concentration of from 5 to 50 percent are preferred for neutralization. These solutions can be used in technical quality and are therefore inexpensive. It is not necessary to reach exactly a ph value of 7 with the neutralization. Generally, a pH value of from 5.5 to 9, preferably from 7 to 8.5 is effective to have the dissolved organic parts biologically degraded.Depending on whether a precipitation of specific inorganic salts, e.g. ferrous salts, is desired or not, a higher pH value, e.g. above 9, can be chosen. Before or during, preferably after neutralization, undissolved organic solid wastes and inorganic impurities of low solubility, e.g. sand, can be removed in a conventional manner, e.g. sedimentation, filtration or centrifuging, from the reaction mixture and disposed in a conventional manner. These residues can be concentrated and dumped as a filter cake or be dried and afterwards be burnt. The solution which is, to a great extent, cleared from the solid wastes, and which contains the dissolved organic parts can again be put into the sewage clarification plant far biological degradation.The dissolved organic mass show excellent degradation rates in an activated sludge installation or in an anaerobic treatment of sewage by bacteria. In order to evaluate the degradability of the dissolved organic parts the known parameters like chemical oxygen demand COD , the biological oxygen demand BOD and the total organic carbon content TOC are measured. The COD is determined according to the dichromate method of DIN norm 38 409. The BOD indicates the oxygen consumption of the bacteria. In the practice of the present invention the BOD was determined within 5 days BOD5 . These standard measurements are described in the German Unitary Process for WaterAnalysis, method H5 . The TOC was determined with aBeckmann instrument, model 915, as described in ASTM method D 2579 78. For evaluating the biodegradability of the dissolved organic parts the ratio of COD to BOD5 in general is estimated. By experience, sludge from raw sewage with a ratio of COD to BOD of less than 3 are said to be readily degradable. By choosing the optimal conditions in the process of the present invention, aCOD BOD ratio of from 1.4 to 1.6 can be reached, which indicates an excellent degradability of the dissolved organic impurities. The outstanding degradability is confirmed by the determination of the COD decrease and the BOD5 decrease. At optimized conditions during the thermal acid treatment, the COD in the solution can be reduced from about 86 to about 88 percent and the BOD5 in the solution from about 96 percent to about 98 percent with the biological degradation by bacteria. The present process is illustrated with reference to the figure. The invention however is not restricted to this embodiment The figure shows the biological purification of sewage, which in this case is an activated sludge system. The sewage water enters the activated sludge system 1 through conduit 16 and is degraded aerobically by bacteria. As an alternative an anerobic degradation by bacteria can also be used. The purified sewage is conducted through conduit 10 to a settling basin 2 where the formed bacteria mass and other insoluble solid wastes settle as a sludge. The remaining solution in the settling basin 2 can be transported to the receiving body of water main outfall through conduit 15 . A part of the sludge is normally recirculated to the activated sludge system through conduit 7 . The excess sludge from the settling basin 2 contains from about 0.2 to about 1.0 weight percent of suspended solid waste and is thickened in dephelgmator 3 until a solid waste content of from about 2 to about 4 weight percent is reached. The filtrate can be recirculated to the activated sludge system 1 through conduit 8 . The sludge from the dephlegmator 3 passes through conduit 11 through a heating area 18 where the sludge is heated to a temperature of from about 100 to about 1300C. By adding steam at a temperature of about 1700C through conduit 12 , the sludge is heated to a temperature of from about 140 to about 1600C, preferably up to about 1500C. By adding acid to the heated sludge, through conduit 13 e.g. 50 to 98 percent sulphuric acid, the pH value of the sludge is adjusted to about 0. The acidified reaction mixture is then passed through a tube shaped reactor 4 having a length of about 6 m and a diameter of about 10 cm. The reactor is kept at a temperature of about 1500C and a pressure of about 6 bar. The speed of the flowing sludge is adjusted in such a manner that the mean dwell time in the reactor is about 2 hours. The hot liquid is then cooled to a temperature of about 500C in cooling section 20 . The liquid is neutralized with e.g. a sodium hydroxide solution from a chloride alkali eletrolytic cell supplied through conduit 14 . The undissolved organic and the inorganic solid wastes are then settled in settling tank 5 . The excess sludge can be additionally dewatered by means of a filter press, or the like.Adjuncts e.g. flocculants can be used. The remaining solution overflow in the settling tank 5 contains about 80 percent of the originally undissolved organic parts in a dissolved and degradable form. The overflow can be recirculated to the activated sludge system 1 through conduit 9 where the organic parts are further degraded. The degradation performance in the activated sludge system 1 depends of course not only on the properties of the treated sewage but among other things also on the time period during which the sewage remains in the activated sludge system on the quantitative proportion of the sewage to the bacteria, and on the ventilation. However, the skilled artisan will know how to optimize these parameters in the activated sludge system. The following examples describe the preferred embodiments of the present invention. All amounts and percentages are by weight. When calculating the TOC,BOD and COD decrease, eventual dilution effects are taken into consideration.Examples Excess sludge from the settling basin with a variable solids content of from 0.2 to 1.0 weight percent is concentrated in the sludge dephlegmator until the solids content reached 2.0 to 4.0 weight percent depending on the solids content from the settling tank . The sludge stream is acidified with 50 percent sulphuric acid in order to provide a pH value of about 0. The sludge stream is heated to a temperature of about 1500C by passing the sludge stream through a reactor having a length of about 6 met. and a diameter of about 10 cm. The average reaction time was about 2 hours at a pressure of 6 bar. After cooling to about 500C, the pH of the sludge stream is adjusted with caustic from chlor alkali cells to a pH value of 8 to 9.The total organic carbon content TOC of the solution which contains dissolved sludge and, which is on top of the remaining sludge remaining solids content , is determined before and after the thermal acid treatment. The degradation rate of the total amount of sludge and of the organic parts respectively is related to the amount of the suspended solid wastes and the organic parts of the suspended solid wastes respectively, before and after the thermal acid treatment.The COD BOD ratio of the neutralized and filtrated reactor discharge is determined.
