# Fiberscope.

## Abstract
A fiberscope in which the cross sectional area is max imized of a passage convenying a clear liquid through which an image of an object to be observed can be transmitted, taking into consideration constraints upon diameters of va rious optical fibers and a surrounding flexible tube. An image transmitting fiber 11 is bundled together with at least one, light guiding fibers 9 which supply illuminating light. The bundled fibers are loosely fitted within a surround ing flexible tube 1 with a space therebetween 15 . A cap member is provided at the end of the flexible tube and optical fiber bundle for maintaining the optical fiber bundle centered at the end of the flexible tube and for directing flows of the clear fluid around the end of the fiber bundle.
