# Control system for an automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A control system is provided for an automatic transmis sion of the kind in which successive gear ratios in a series are obtained by switching the drive between first and second clutches. When one gear ratio eg. 4th top is engaged and conditions prevail which anticipate a downchange to the adjacent lower gear ratio 3rd , the selector control device 42 associated with the adjacent lower gear ratio is operated by an interconnection 46A, 46B with the driving circuit 38 associated with the one gear ratio, thereby pre engaging the gear train of the adjacent lower gear ratio. The interconnec tion is blocked by a blocking circuit 47 under other conditions to prevent unnecessary wear.

## Description
Control System for an Automatic Transmission The invention relates to control systems for automatic transmissions of the kind in which a plurality of gear trains provides a series of gear ratios between an input and an output, the gear trains each being engagable by a respective selector mechanism, a first clutch completing the drive from the input to the output for one set of gear trains which provide alternate gear ratios in the series and a second clutch completing the drive from the input to the output for the other set of gear trains in the series. A problem with automatic transmissions of the kind described above is that the time that each selector mechanism takes to engage or disengage its respective gear train affects the subjective quality of the gearchange. In the case of a change from a high gear ratio to the adjacent lower gear ratio this time may appear to the driver as a hesitation if the accelerator pedal is depressed rapidly for a kickdown gear change. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a control system for an automatic transmission of the kind described in which the hesitation during a kickdown gearchange is reduced. According to the invention there is provided a control system for an automatic transmission of the kind described, the control system including a respective driving circuit and selector control device for each selector mechanism and auxiliary means for operating the selector control device associated with the gear train which provides the adjacent lower gear ratio when one gear ratio is selected and conditions prevail which anticipate a downchange from said one gear ratio to said adjacent lower gear ratio. The auxiliary means may comprise an interconnection between the driving circuit of the selector control device associated with the gear train providing said one gear ratio and the selector control device associated with the gear train providing said adjacent lower gear ratio and a blocking circuit in said interconnection to block the interconnection except under said conditions which anticipate a downchange. The blocking circuit maybe connected to a road speed signal generator, said conditions which anticipate a downchange being constituted by the road speed being lower than a reference speed substantially equal to the maximum permitted speed 5 in said adjacent lower gear ratio. Preferably the blocking circuit includes a comparator and a reference signal generator, the comparator having inputs connected to the road speed signal generator and the reference signal generator and an output connected to the selector control device of said adjacent lower gear ratio to engage said lower gear ratio when said one gear ratio is engaged and the road speed signal is below the reference signal. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic section of a transmission of the kind described Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a control system according to the invention and Fig. 3 shows part of the control system of Fig. 2 in more detail. In Fig. 1 the transmission comprises an input shaft 11, such as the crankshaft of an engine, which drives lst and 3rd gear ratio driving gears 12 and 13 through a first clutch 14 and 2nd and 4th gear ratio driving gears 15 and 16 through a second clutch 17. 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gear ratio driven gears 18, 19, 21 and 22 respectively are free to turn relative to an output shaft 23 except when coupled to the output shaft 23 by a lst 3rd syncromesh 24 or a 2nd 4th syncromesh 25. When moved in one direction, syncromesh 24 acts as a selector mechanism 24A for the 1st gear train 12, 18 and, when moved in the other direction, acts as a selector mechanism 24B for the 3rd gear train 13, 19.Similarly, when moved in one direction, syncromesh 25 acts as a selector mechanism 25A for the 2nd gear train 15, 21 and, when moved in the other direction, acts as a selector mechanism 25B for the 4th gear train 16, 22. Such a transmission is described in GB. 2 064 028A. Fig. 2 shows a control circuit 31 which receives signals indicative of accelerator pedal position from a travel transducer 32 and road speed from an inductive transducer 33 which feeds a road speed signal generator 34. The control circuit 31 operates to command a particular gear ratio in the automatic transmission shown in Fig. 1 through respective driving circuits 35, 36, 37 and 38. Each driving circuit 35, 36, 37 or 38 controls a respective selector control device for the selector mechanism 24A, 25A, 24B or 25B, of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th speed forward gear ratio of the transmission, each selector control device including a respective solenoid valve 39, 41, 42 or 43. The control circuit 31 also controls a solenoid valve 44 for the operation of the first clutch 14 and a solenoid valve 45 for operation of the second clutch 17. GB. 2 070 704A describes the operation of the control circuit 31 and driving circuits 35, 36, 37 and 38 in more detail. When the 4th gear ratio is engaged and conditions prevail which anticipate a downchange to the adjacent lower gear ratio ie. 3rd , the invention provides auxiliary means for operating the selector control device of said adjacent lower gear ratio. In the example shown, the auxiliary means comprise a connection 46A, 46B between the 3rd gear ratio driving circuit 37 and the 4th gear ratio solenoid 43. This connection retains the 3rd gear train gears 13 and 19 in engagement when the 4th gear train gears 16 and 22 is engaged and driving through the second clutch 17 and is switched by a blocking circuit 47 which blocks the connection 46A, 46B when the road speed is above a value which approximates to the maximum speed in 3rd gear, ie.the maximum speed at which the control module will allow a kickdown change from 4th to 3rd. By kickdown change we mean a downchange induced by sudden depression of the accelerator pedal. The blocking circuit 47 has a connection 48 with the road speed signal generator 34. Thus in this example the conditions which anticipate a gear change from 4th to 3rd are that the road speed is in the range in which a kickdown is possible. Other conditions might include the actual speed of depression of the accelerator pedal or deceleration of the vehicle. When the conditions do not prevail it saves wear of the gear components to disconnect the 3rd gear train. Whilst the 3rd gear train is connected but not driving, it is of course necessary to disengage the first clutch 14, which may be achieved by connection 49 from the blocking circuit 47 to the first clutch solenoid valve 44. In Fig. 3 the blocking circuit 47 is shown in more detail. The connection 48 to the road speed signal generator 34 forms one input of a comparator 51 which compares the road speed signal with a reference signal from a reference signal generator 52. When the road speed signal is below the reference signal corresponding to the maximum permitted speed in 3rd gear the comparator 51 provides an output signal to an input of an AND gate 53 whose other input is to connection 46A from the 4th gear driving circuit 38. When 4th gear is engaged and the road speed is below the maximum permitted speed in 3rd gear, the AND gate 53 provides a signal to connection 46B to operate the 3rd gear ratio solenoid valve 42 and thus engage the 3rd gear train gears 13 and 14 .
