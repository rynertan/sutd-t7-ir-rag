# Pulsed multichannel protection system with saturable core magnetic logic units.

## Abstract
The dynamic logic of each channel of a multi channel protection system for a nuclear power plant provides a trip logic path and a global bypass logic path by which pulse signals from a clock source may be transmitted to a dc to dc power converter which energizes the undervoltage coils for a pair of contactors in the reactor trip switchgear. Each of the logic paths is constructed of basic logic units which in turn, each include a toroidal core of rectangular, hysteresis loop magnetic material having a control winding which must be energized by a dc current in order for pulses applied to an input winding to appear at an output winding. Blockage of pulses through any one of the serially connected basic logic units in a logic path terminates the flow of pulses to the converter through that logic path. The control windings of corresponding logic units of the trip logic path in each channel are energized by one of a set of redundant sensors which monitor one of a plurality of reactor trip parameters. Dynamic voting logic appropriate for existing conditions is implemented in part by microprocessors in each channel which gather status information from the other channels through isolated, fiber optic, multiplexed data links and provide the switching logic for alternate paths for energiza tion of the individual basic logic unit control windings, so that for instance, coincidence of trip signals from corres ponding sensors in at least two out of four unbypassed channels is required to trip the reactor switch gear. Local bypasses provide additional energization paths for the control windings of basic logic units associated with sensors which are out of service or being repaired. Pulses propagate through the basic logic units of the global bypass path when an entire channel is taken out of service for testing or maintenance. Interlocks between logic units in the trip logic and global bypass logic paths permit only one path to deliver pulses to the converter at any given instant.
